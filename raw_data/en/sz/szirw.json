Good morning and welcome to the3 Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion4 Task Force of which I, Damon T. Arnold, chair.5 I would like to start this6 session on time as we have much to cover in this7 public hearing. Before beginning the hearing, I8 would like to present some housekeeping ground9 rules for the hearing. Please place all cell 10 phones and pagers onto silent or vibratory mode.11 Also, take all side conversations outside of this12 room during all phases of this hearing and during13 presentations as this will disrupt the progress of14 the public hearing.15 A sign language provider and a16 Spanish language translator are also available17 should assistance be required. If you have any18 specific or special need for assistance, please19 let one of my staff members know. Additionally,20 the bathrooms are located in the hallway as21 indicated on posted signage. Male to the right.22 Female to the left.23 Additionally, the bathrooms are24 there for your convenience. Please also note thePage 4 1 safety signs located in the hallways should an 2 emergency arise, requiring an emergency response3 or building evacuation. To begin, chronic disease4 in the state of Illinois has resulted in a heavy5 economic and medical resources burden. It6 resulted in the loss of about $12.5 billion in7 Illinois during the study period leading to Public8 Act 096-1073.9 However, the chronic disease 10 impact is also evidenced by lost work time and11 social instability resulting in an additional12 $43.6 billion lost in Illinois as well during the13 same time period.14 Further, projections for both15 the short and long-term medical, fiscal situation16 are dire at best. For example, currently,17 two-thirds of adults and one-third of children in18 the United States are overweight. Fifty percent19 of the adults have a body mass index of 31 or20 greater with an index of 30 being indicative of21 obesity. In fact, it is projected that one out of22 three children born in the year 2000 or after will23 develop diabetes in their lifetime. They will24 also average a shorter lifespan than their parentsPage 5 1 for the first time in history. 2 For those of you who know me, I3 have noted previously over the years that the4 mouth is a common pathway to the vast majority of5 chronic diseases. It is the entry point for poor6 nutrition, alcohol, tobacco in all of its forms,7 illegal drugs, misapplied prescription drugs,8 poisons and even infectious diseases.9 In order to address chronic 10 diseases within the state of Illinois, the General11 Assembly through Senate Bill 2583, which was12 introduced by Senator William Delgado, created13 Public Act 096-1073.14 This act amends Section 5, the15 Department of Public Health Powers and Duties Law16 of the Civil Administrative Code Illinois, 20 ILCS17 2310/23-76, to create the Chronic Disease18 Prevention and Health Promotion Task Force. The19 charge of Public Act 096-1073 is to, one,20 establish a Chronic Disease Prevention and Health21 Promotion Task Force, two, hold at least three22 public hearings throughout the state of Illinois23 and, three, submit a report of recommendations to24 the General Assembly and Public Health Director byPage 6 1 the 31st of December 2010. 2 Consistent with Senate Bill3 2583, the Public Act 096-1073, the Chronic Disease4 Prevention and Health Promotion Task Force5 consists of a total of 19 members. One, the6 director of the Department of Public Health who7 serves as the chair, two, the Public Health8 Advocate appointed by the Governor, three, the9 Secretary of the Department of Human Services or 10 his or her designee, four, the Director of Aging11 or his or her designee, five, the Director of12 Health Care and Family Services or his or her13 designee.14 In addition, four members of the15 General Assembly. One from the State Senate16 appointed by the President of the Senate. One17 from the State Senate appointed by the Minority18 Leader of the Senate. One from the House of19 Representatives appointed by the Speaker of the20 House and one from the House of Representatives21 appointed by the Minority Leader of the House.22 In addition, there are ten23 members appointed by the Director of Public Health24 and who shall be representative of statePage 7 1 associations and advocacy organizations with the 2 primary focus that includes chronic disease3 prevention, public health delivery, medicine,4 healthcare and disease management or community5 health.6 The Chronic Disease Prevention7 and Health Promotion Task Force herein after is8 referred to as the CDPHP Task Force for9 documentation purposes. Currently, the CDPHP Task 10 Force includes the following members; one,11 Dr. Damon Arnold, M.D., M.P.H., Director of the12 Illinois Public Health and Task Force Chairman,13 two, Dr. Quentin Young, M.D., the Public Health14 Advocate, three, Dr. James M. Galloway, M.D.,15 Assistant Surgeon General, Regional Health16 Administrator for Region V, US Department of17 Health and Human Services and an alternate of18 Robert Herskovitz, who is a Deputy Regional Health19 Administrator, Region V, US DHS. Also, Senator20 William Delgado, State Representative Elizabeth21 Coulson, State Representative Cynthia Soto and22 Michael Jones from the Illinois Department of23 Healthcare and Family Services and Dr. Lorrie24 Rickman-Jones, Ph.D., Director of Mental HealthPage 8 1 Services, Illinois Department of Human Services, 2 Janice Cichowlas, who is with the Illinois3 Department on Aging, who is present here. Also,4 Michael Isaacson, Director of Community Health in5 Kane County Health Department, who is to my left.6 Dr. Paul Brandt-Rauf, M.D., Doctor of Public7 Health, Scientific Doctor, Dean of the University8 of Illinois School of Public Health, Dr. David9 Stewart, M.D., M.P.H., Professor and Chairman, 10 Department of Internal Medicine, Southern Illinois11 University School of Medicine, Miriam12 Link-Mullison, Administrator Jackson County Health13 Department, Mr. Joel Africk, who is the President14 and CEO of the Respiratory Health Association of15 Metropolitan Chicago, Dr. Robert A.C. Cohen, M.D.,16 Director of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,17 Cook County Health and Hospital System, Chairman,18 Division of Pulmonary Medicine and Critical Care,19 John H.

The5 first time was in the form of a video and6 telephonic meeting which occurred on September7 28th of 2010.8 During this meeting, Senate Bill9 2583 and Public Act 096-1073 were reviewed and the 10 charge to the CDPHP Task Force was stated. Also,11 preliminary ideas and suggestions were recorded as12 notes for structuring the framework of the CDPHP13 Task Force. Due to a quorum not being achieved at14 any one given location during this meeting, voting15 did not occur. Several documents were provided by16 the IDPH staff concerning information from the CDC17 and Illinois specific information concerning18 expenditures and the chronic disease burden for19 the state of Illinois.20 As chair of the Task Force, I21 know that IDPH will create a website, which has22 been established and is currently under23 development for the CDPHP Task Force.24 I noted that it should includePage 10 1 tables for the collection of information 2 concerning, one, government organizational charts,3 two, a CDPHP Task Force organizational chart and4 general member information, three, general5 assembly legislative House and Senate bills, rules6 and laws impacting chronic disease within the7 state of Illinois. Four, the completed State8 Health Improvement Plan framework document, five,9 Federal and National best practices for chronic 10 disease prevention and health promotion11 guidelines, six, the existing Illinois State12 community based best practice model and any13 documentation submitted to the Task Force14 membership, seven, a listing of national NGO's and15 relevant documentation such as for the institute16 of medicine, American Public Health Association,17 Association of State and Territorial Health18 Officials, National Association of City and County19 Health Officials, the American College of20 Occupational and Environmental Medicine, the21 American Medical Association, the American Public22 Health Association and the American Pediatrics23 Association, the American Dietetic Association and24 the American College of Emergency Physicians, etPage 11 1 cetera. Eight, the Federal, State and Private 2 sector tools and resources and, nine, a calendar3 of events related to the Chronic Disease4 Prevention and Health Promotion Task Force.5 In addition, Joe Africk6 recommended the creation of a chronic disease7 matrix for determining which diseases the CDPHP8 Task Force should initially consider for9 consideration. 10 During the second meeting on11 October 14th, 2010, the Chronic Disease Prevention12 and Health Promotion Task Force was assembled and13 with a quorum being present voted upon and adopted14 by-laws which govern and guide the functions and15 operations of the CDPHP Task Force. A copy of the16 CDPHP Task Force's first meeting documents and17 approved minutes, second meeting notes and the18 approved CDPHP Task Force by-laws are attached to19 this document for inclusion in the testimony20 stream being presented here today. In order to21 accomplish the objectives set forth by SB 2583 and22 Public Act 096-1073 regarding public hearings,23 this Task Force will seek input from the24 interested parties. The Task Force shall hold aPage 12 1 minimum of three public hearings across the state 2 including one in northern Illinois, one in central3 Illinois and one in southern Illinois. The4 selected sites and times for these meetings and5 hearings are, one, Chicago, northern location, 156 November 2010 at Michael A. Bilandic building,7 Room C 500, which is presently occurring, 10 a.m.8 to 1:00 p.m. Two, Springfield, central location,9 22nd of November 2010 at the Southern Illinois 10 University School of Medicine from the time period11 of 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Three, Mount Vernon,12 southern location, 30 November 2010, meeting site13 to be determined, 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.14 Therefore, the CDPHP Task Force15 is assembled here today to listen to and record16 the first of these public testimonies. This17 testimony will in part serve as the basis for the18 establishment of a document containing Task Force19 recommendations that will be submitted to the20 Governor's office, IDPH Director and the State21 Legislature on or before December 31st, 2010.22 Consistent with the intent of the legislative act,23 the content of this report at a minimum will24 contain recommendations concerning the followingPage 13 1 issues: One, chronic disease prevention and 2 health promotion delivery systems reform within3 the state of Illinois, two, ensuring adequate4 funding for infrastructure and delivery of5 programs, three, the addressing of health6 disparities based upon economic, race, ethnicity7 and other factors. Four, the role of health8 promotion and chronic disease prevention in9 support of state spending on healthcare. 10 The source for the General11 Assembly's focus on the above issues for Task12 Force recommendations is contained in Public Act's13 95-900, effective date, 8/25/08, and 96-32814 effective date, 8/11/2009. Additionally, the15 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in16 Atlanta have noted three priority areas of17 concern. One, obesity, two, tobacco abuse, three,18 injury prevention.19 This focus was born in mind when20 developing the state health improvement plan which21 recognized five public health system priorities22 and nine priority health concerns. The health23 plan actually serves as a framework for further24 state engagement. The five public health systemPage 14 1 priorities included, one, improved access to 2 health services, two, enhance data and health3 information technology, three, address social4 determinants of health and health disparities,5 four, measure, manage, improve and sustain the6 public health system, five, assure a sufficient7 work force and human resources. The nine public8 health concerns identified included, not in rank9 order, one, alcohol and tobacco, two, use of 10 illicit drugs and misuse of illicit drugs, three,11 mental health, four, natural and built12 environments, five, obesity, nutrition and13 physical activity, six, oral health, seven,14 patient safety and quality, eight, unintentional15 injury, nine, violence.16 The SHIP document can be found17 at www.IDPH.state.il.us/ship. The diabetes18 program was moved from the Illinois Department of19 Human Services back to the Illinois Department of20 Public Health as of 1 July 2010 by an executive21 order of the Office of Governor Quinn. A Senate22 Bill, initiated by Mattie Hunter, which was23 unanimously passed and adopted by the legislature24 also strongly supported the position for restoringPage 15 1 the diabetes program back to the Department of 2 Public Health.3 This will greatly facilitate the4 reintegration of the antiobesity and diabetes5 objectives paving the way for better programatic6 funding opportunities, efficiencies and outcome7 for the state of Illinois.8 We will proceed with the hearing9 according to the following format. This format is 10 structured in the order to afford time for all of11 those wishing to provide testimony to have an12 opportunity to do so. One, each speaker will be13 allowed five minutes for the provision of their14 testimony. A timekeeper will indicate your time15 remaining. Please begin your testimony by stating16 your full name and spell it for the testimony17 recorder. Also, provide the name of your18 organizational affiliation and who you represent19 if this applies.20 Two, any supporting21 documentations that the speaker wishes to submit22 for further Task Force review can be handed to the23 testimony recorder. Three, additional time, not24 to exceed three minutes, will be provided for anyPage 16 1 questions the Task Force members may have for the 2 testimony presenters. Please adhere to the3 following time-related guidelines in order to4 respect those waiting to testify. The order of5 the presentations will be organized into6 groupings. This is due to the fact that there are7 literally thousands of types of chronic disease8 states in existence. In addition, prevention9 spans the entire chronic disease intervention 10 continuum. Prevention begins with averting the11 consequence of chronic disease itself through12 education, nutrition, exercise, screening and13 early diagnosis and cure.14 However, it also spans the15 arenas of basic research and ongoing curative,16 maintenance and palliative forms of treatment17 intervention to prevent further chronic disease18 complications from occurring. Note that both19 categories of prevention are focused upon the20 reduction of morbidity, pain and suffering, and a21 premature mortality or death. With this in mind,22 the testimony will be separated into three timed23 components as noted in the agenda.24 One, prevention strategiesPage 17 1 focused on the prevention of occurrence of chronic 2 disease, 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., followed by a3 five minute break. Two, prevention strategies4 focused on prevention of worsening of existing5 chronic disease states, 11:35 to 12:35, followed6 by a five minute break. Three, additional7 testimony related to either category within the8 remaining time allotted from 12:40 to9 approximately 1:00 p.m. If time lapses without 10 sufficient time for those in attendance to present11 their information, consideration will be given for12 an additional meeting to be arranged for a future13 time period.14 As the Act noted, there was a15 minimum of three hearings that are required.16 However, if we have more time that is required, we17 will consider another meeting within the18 locations.19 So, with that, I'm trying to get20 people to categorize themselves into one of those21 two categories. You can testify at both times if22 you wish, but I think you can get your main points23 across, but the main crux of what you are trying24 to talk about should be in one of these twoPage 18 1 categories so that we can have at least some kind 2 of understanding of continuity across the3 spectrum.4 What I have in front of you is a5 chart that will be available on the website. I am6 not going to go into the details of this chart7 because as you will see it will take ten hours8 with the complexity of it. There is a simplified9 chart, but it is actually outlining why I feel it 10 is important for everyone to be on the same page.11 We are actually facing a formidable foe in chronic12 disease. If we do not do something about it, we13 will be facing the consequences and children will14 be facing the consequences of a system that will15 implode.16 We are at a time where we no17 longer have time or can afford to not cooperate18 and work together to make sure things happen.19 I'll say more about that at the closing remarks,20 but, with that, I'm going to allow my panel21 members who are equally talented or more so22 talented than I am to have any comments that they23 would like to make, brief remarks before we start24 this session. They are all very, very talented.Page 19 1 This is why these 19 people are on this panel. 2 They have some insight into what is going on in3 the community level. Some of them are actually4 engaged in community level activities, which have5 been successful, but I want to make sure that6 everyone is included in this model. The person7 that should be running the healthcare system is8 the person that opens the door when you knock on9 it. That's the patient. That's the person that's 10 in the community who is in the school who is11 growing up in this community.12 We need to be cognizant that13 those are the people that we're here for. So,14 with that, I yield the time to any of my panel15 members who would like to speak.16 That's the first time I've heard17 them not say something. They are all very, very18 talented and very good. I see their minds are19 already organized. I think they're ready to go20 somewhere. So let's start with this. What I'm21 going to do is have people come up in groups of22 three or four. They can actually fill in this23 front row here for your testimony. So if you are24 ready to provide your testimony, the first groupPage 20 1 will come forward and we're exactly on time -- 2 actually, five minutes to spare. The first group3 I would like is for anyone who has prevention4 strategies focused on the prevention or occurrence5 of chronic disease. So if you are associated with6 a group that is dealing with nutrition, exercise7 or that is talking about some type of intervention8 on the educational level, those kinds of things,9 please come forward at this time. 10 We'll take it in the row of11 order, in this row order, and if you are -- if you12 don't have a seat presently, we'll just use these13 front seats to go across. My timekeeper is there.14 He has his signs already. So he is going to sort15 of buzz you and let you know your time has elapsed16 or is getting close to it.17 We want to, again, stay very18 closely to this type of program. I said these19 categories may be a little bit confusing. As20 people address prevention, it spans the whole21 arena. For example, obesity has a prevention22 component which is heavily tied with the23 legislation and engineering. Other things we24 don't want such as high calorie diets or transPage 21 1 fats, those kinds of things, high fat diets as 2 well. But we also have exercise and nutrition as3 being a very, very heavy component in education,4 but we also have the treatment side where we5 either can cure something, we can maintain it or6 palliate it, the consequences of it. So, for7 example, if someone were to develop diabetes, we8 can do laser therapy for the eyes and stop9 proliferative retinopathy or we can have 10 amputations. We can do other things that would11 take care of this person. What we want to do is12 really stay on the side of people never developing13 disease, but we have to be cognizant that people14 will develop disease and we have to be ready for15 both sides of this equation.16 If prevention strategies do fill17 or take care of 90 percent of the problems that we18 have, we still have that ten percent that will19 require medical care down the road. So we have to20 be cognizant that this is a continuum and a21 continuous picture that we have to be supporting.22 So, with that, I'll have the first speaker step to23 the microphone.24 MS. BYRD: Good morning.Page 22 1 MR. ARNOLD: Good morning. 2 MS. BYRD: I'm Dr. Jennifer Byrd.3 I'm the medical director for Aunt Martha's Youth4 Service Center. I'm here representing our company5 and Raul Garza, our CEO. I'm here to present a6 service integration model. There are handouts7 available for the members. I would like to remark8 that Aunt Martha's is a 38-year old organization.9 We have eight divisions and four sections. We 10 provide housing and shelter for children, for11 young adults, intervention and support, provide12 healthy lifestyles in a safe, suitable environment13 and a great alternative to juvenile justice and,14 hopefully, reunification. We also have15 educational life skills programs that prepare16 children to enter school and also has parenting17 intervention classes and I'm here to discuss our18 health and prevention program.19 Our health program was started20 in 1972 as a drop-in center for children and teens21 in Park Forest, Illinois. In 1976, we provided22 family planning services or we began that service.23 In 1978, we began to offer prenatal care. 1990,24 family case management was added. In 1997, wePage 23 1 achieved our first accreditation and have had 2 successive accreditations thereafter for the last3 12 years and in 1999 we achieved our FQHC status.4 In our approach to increase5 access, we have provided or we are on pace to6 provide approximately 284,000 patient visits this7 year. In FY04, as you can see in your list there,8 we provided about 30,000 patient visits. We've9 had a hypergrowth throughout the last six years. 10 Those have been targeted growths based on market11 forces and the need in the community. And as I12 said now, as of FY010 -- FY10, pardon me, we're on13 pace to see 284,000 visits.14 MR. ARNOLD: You're telling me15 from -- for all this time, for six years, you have16 grown 900 percent?17 MS. BYRD: Correct.18 MR. ARNOLD: Go for it.19 THE AUDIENCE: Excuse me. We cannot20 hear back here. I'm sorry.21 MS. BYRD: I apologize.22 MR. ARNOLD: Is that on?23 MS. BYRD: So, as I was saying, we24 have grown and we had a hypergrowth period, butPage 24 1 with regards to our income and our payment source 2 of our patients, we do like to feel as though3 we're keeping a balance of uninsured and4 underinsured patients and on your pie graph you'll5 see there with regards to the poverty level, we6 see about 88 percent persons who are 100 percent7 or more below poverty. With regards to our8 patient's payment source, we see about 55 percent9 of people who are receiving Medicaid and about 36 10 percent of people who have no insurance or who are11 underinsured and that is something we're very12 proud of to maintain.13 With regards to health and14 prevention, we provide family medicine services,15 pediatrics, internal medicine, women's health,16 family planning, OB/GYN, oral health as well as17 dental hygiene, adult psychiatry, child and18 adolescent psychiatry. We're very happy and proud19 to have seven fellowship trained child and20 adolescent psychiatrists in our employ. We21 provide therapy services, adolescent substance22 abuse and treatment, adult substance abuse and23 treatment. We have healthy start and family case24 management programs.Page 25 1 What we're most -- one of the 2 things we're most proud of is our integration3 service model. It's a unique model of prevention4 and screening as a part of our development towards5 our chronic care model which we choose to6 undertake and perfect within the next year.7 We have two screening tools that8 are patient driven, PHQ, patient health9 questionnaire, which is a nine question tool that 10 allows us to screen for depression. We also have11 an oral health screening tool, which is a six12 question patient driven tool. Those are completed13 in the waiting room. They're scored by our14 nursing medical assistants, they're reviewed by15 the physicians and we make active, immediate16 referrals into those services so that we're proud17 to say that 52 percent of our patients who receive18 primary care also receive oral health services, 5819 percent of our behavioral health patients also20 receive primary care services and 40 percent of21 IBCCP patients receive primary dental or22 behavioral health services. We monitor those23 referrals. We track them internally. We have an24 electronic tool that allows us to screen and trackPage 26 1 and referral not only the health division, but 2 every division of Aunt Martha's is able to go to3 an electronic tool and refer into our services.4 So we're very proud of that.5 Our ultimate goal is that every6 patient have the benefit of primary care, oral7 health and behavioral health services. That is8 true, synergistic healthcare and true healthcare9 homes for our patients. That is the crux of my 10 discussion today.11 I wanted to just highlight the12 fact that we integrate internally, but we also13 integrate externally and work with many community14 partners. Our newest example is with the National15 Latino Educational Institute. It's going -- it's16 a Chicago based organization. It's going to17 provide work force development and training,18 hopefully, to empower people from the community,19 provide health education for themselves and they20 can provide health education in our clinics.21 This coincides with the receipt22 of our ARRA funding. We're going to select 2023 members and it's going to be a very exciting24 collaboration so we're looking forward to that.Page 27 1 MR. ARNOLD: Phenomenal. One of the 2 questions I have for you, do you have metrics of3 the care provided as far as patient outcomes or4 how -- any kind of cost savings analysis?5 MS. BYRD: We are working to refine6 that model. That's my goal for this year.7 Actually, that's my responsibility for this year8 to be able to track outcomes and know the world of9 a diabetic, which ones have A1C that is greater 10 than seven, and provide a tool by which we can get11 in touch with them. So knowing the world of a12 diabetic, the world of the hyperintensive, the13 world of the obese patient and come to know those14 metrics. So I'm working on a research program now15 that would allow me to do that.16 MR. ARNOLD: Sounds like an17 incredible system. I'm looking at the total18 number of patients. Any questions from anyone19 else on the panel?20 MR. MITCHELL: One question. Can21 you elaborate about the compliance of the --22 compliance of your services as it relates to the23 quality or performance improvement criteria that24 you have through the federal government? I.e.,Page 28 1 how are you actually monitoring the A1C and the 2 criteria that is established by the feds in order3 for you to receive your 330 funding?4 MS. BYRD: Right now, we have an5 electronic system that does that for us. We6 generate reports based on diagnoses and we go to7 the medical records. We are two and a half years8 into a three and a half year conversion from paper9 records to electronic. So, at this point, we run 10 a diagnosis code registry and we have a reviewer11 that goes to each facility and does a calculated12 tabulation. We did not want to wait for the13 electronic tool to be able to monitor that.14 So we come to know that diabetic15 patient and those that are not meeting the16 requirements, they get a postcard. They will17 ultimately be receiving a postcard. That's the18 current model that we have. We'll be very happy19 to implement our next gen and have more20 capabilities to do that in the future.21 MR. AFRICK: Dr. Byrd, I have a22 couple questions. I'm Joel Africk from23 Respiratory Health Association. With respect to24 tobacco cessation, screening or asking andPage 29 1 advising and referring people out, is that 2 currently a part of your health prevention3 program?4 MS. BYRD: Yes. I didn't mention5 it, but we have a social risk assessment form and6 as these doctors come on they do a sex, drugs and7 rock and roll screen. So it gives us information8 on tobacco use, drug use, sexual activity and9 those screens are looked at directly by the 10 provider and they're referred -- referred to11 internal programs based on their usage.12 MR. AFRICK: Great. If I can follow13 up with two more quick questions. One is, what14 are the different state education agencies with15 which Aunt Martha's currently interacts as part of16 its daily business?17 MS. BYRD: We have funding from the18 Illinois Department of Public Health -- is one of19 our major sources. We also have a grant from --20 for our team parenting services and also for21 our -- that is our RDCP program. That comes from22 the public health department. So those are the23 major ones.24 MR. AFRICK: As part of the work ofPage 30 1 this Task Force, we're not only being asked to get 2 our arms around the magnitude of chronic disease,3 but also to develop some recommendations. So to4 you and any of the other speakers that we have5 today, if you would give some thought not only to6 describing the problems you're addressing and, in7 some cases, the wonderful ways you're addressing8 them, but to give some thought to any9 recommendations that you have for us to 10 incorporate into our recommendations, that would11 be helpful.12 MS. BYRD: I think one thing I would13 add that with our behavioral health model and with14 our oral health model as well, the behavioral15 health model is case manager driven and they16 manage each patient. There's a wraparound system.17 We came to have that competency from being18 involved with the National Healthcare19 Collaborative. We received the competency in20 adult health depression. We returned it to get it21 in adolescent depression and we implement it in22 one clinic and we spread it to all of our 1723 clinics. It is a PHQ driven system and case24 managers receive those PHQ's after being reviewedPage 31 1 by the doctor and we have a warm handoff system in 2 that our patient that day who is depressed who3 needs to be referred to therapy or psychiatry,4 meets the case manager, they see a face so that5 when they come back they're more likely to come6 back because they've seen a face and when they get7 there they're less likely to be anxious about the8 new encounter.9 So we have a warm handoff and a 10 wraparound service regarding that. We run oral11 health services the same way. We didn't feel as12 though we needed to reinvent the wheel. We knew13 we had a great care manager model. So our general14 services, our oral services, had the same model15 that is care manager driven.16 MR. ARNOLD: Very good.17 MR. ISAACSON: Dr. Byrd, good18 morning. My name is Michael Isaacson. I19 represent the Northern Illinois Public Health20 Consortium. I'm just wondering -- I'm going to21 ask you to generalize a little bit. With all your22 years of experience in helping so many patients,23 what is the one greatest need that we have and24 this can expand into our community and into ourPage 32 1 society, but what is the one thing we need to do 2 to help your patients with chronic disease both3 preventing them and educating them?4 MS. BYRD: I would say our one5 greatest need is to have a way to share6 information rapidly. Paper slows us down. Paper7 is inadequate. So our one greatest need is to8 have a comprehensive, ubiquitous, universal9 electronic form of communicating about patient 10 care. In my mind, that would help us have better11 information about the patient. It would also12 allow us to know if patients are seeing multiple13 providers. It would also allows us to have safety14 with medication reconciliation and allow us to15 know what chronic diseases, early medical16 conditions, that they either don't remember or17 don't choose to tell us that we can further their18 treatment.19 MR. ISAACSON: Thank you.20 MR. ARNOLD: Okay. Thank you very21 much for your testimony. Very well done. Next22 person.23 MS. GIBBONS: Good morning. My name24 is Linda Gibbons. I'm a certified school nursePage 33 1 and director of the health education and school 2 nurse certification program at National Louis3 University. I'm representing the Illinois4 Association of School Nurses.5 MR. ARNOLD: One quick question.6 When you approach the mic, please say your name7 and spell it and then also -- you've already given8 your organization.9 MS. GIBBONS: Yes. My name is Linda 10 Gibbons, L-I-N-D-A, G-I-B-B-O-N-S. Our children11 in Illinois spend almost seven hours a day, 18812 days a year for 12 to 13 years in our public13 schools. With all of that time, our graduates14 should know how to make healthy lifestyle15 decisions and have learned habits that prevent16 disease and lead to better health. Research tells17 us that habits are best formed early in life so18 it's important to teach nutrition and care for19 their bodies in the early grades so that they can20 avoid growing up with conditions that predispose21 them to chronic disease. Increasing the amount22 and quality of health education in our public23 schools is a cost-effective way of starting a24 whole generation of students on a healthier lifePage 34 1 start. 2 Who will do this health3 teaching? Consistency is key. Our students need4 to hear the same message of health from their5 teachers, lunch supervisors, principals and the6 school nurse. Currently in Illinois, all schools7 are required to have a wellness policy. However,8 there is a lack of enforcement for the9 implementation of this policy. It sits on a shelf 10 somewhere. With school nurses as leaders of the11 wellness team, they lead a coordinated effort12 towards wellness and health promotion across all13 areas of the school community. Requiring14 documentation of wellness activities, lessons in15 the classroom and extra curricular activities for16 the school and communities will assist our17 students in making wise choices that lead to18 higher levels of learning and create good healthy19 habits.20 Illinois is already proactive in21 requiring Type 73 certification for school nurses22 that includes developing skills and expertise in23 education to add to the health and wellness24 expertise that the school nurse brings. Thus,Page 35 1 certified school nurses have a background in 2 health and education and are prepared to develop3 and teach a health curriculum as well as when4 students come to our offices at a rate of 20 to5 100 a day depending on the school.6 Health teachers are scarce in7 the lower grades, but the school nurse is8 available to provide that curriculum and support9 classroom teachers. We know that the fastest 10 rising public health problem in our nation is11 obesity. One-third of our children and12 adolescents are overweight or obese and children13 from diverse ethnicities and poverty are even more14 affected by this epidemic. Childhood overweight15 accelerates the development of various chronic16 diseases. Most children spend a large portion of17 their day at school and schools are a key setting18 in which to implement the strategies to address19 this issue.20 The school nurse has the21 capacity to reach a large group of youths from22 diverse groups. They're already there. Obesity23 must be addressed through this. What did we do to24 impact that? We respond to physical and emotionalPage 36 1 concerns. We connect students with substance 2 abuse treatment and mental, behavioral and3 reproductive services. We refer families to care4 providers and insurance programs. We screen for5 conditions that impair learning such as vision and6 hearing. We educate our children about healthy7 lifestyles and we ensure immunization compliance.8 This is in addition to caring for injuries and9 illness in managing the care of students with 10 chronic health conditions. With minimal11 additional spending, appropriate clerical services12 have allowed a certified school nurse more time to13 teach and promote wellness. A lack of school14 nurses due to underfunding in many localities may15 have long-term health and economic consequences.16 According to the CDC, chronic17 conditions consume 75 cents of every health dollar18 spent in 2005. When school nurses identify and19 manage these conditions, they stave off future20 health problems and help reduce overall healthcare21 spending. The CDC has also found correlation22 between lower academic grades and health risk23 behavior such as smoking, acts of violence and24 unsafe sex.Page 37 1 This state strongly suggests 2 that school health services that promote healthy3 behaviors also contribute to educational success.4 We are well positioned to play a pivotal role in5 improving students health by ensuring continuity6 of care, but greater coordination is needed7 between education and healthcare sectors for us to8 fully realize this potential.9 Every child in Illinois deserves 10 a school nurse so that he/she can become a11 healthier, well-educated adult who will contribute12 positively to our society. Thank you for your13 time.14 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you. Thank you15 very much. One of the things that you are also16 associated with is -- there are a few bills that17 are floating out there. One is the Health18 Education Task Force, which I have illustrated19 here, and there's also another bill for children20 and diabetes in schools talking about really21 having another provider sort of intervening and22 helping to take care of children so that's under23 consideration now.24 What do you see as an effectivePage 38 1 model for schools? What do you think that we can 2 have as a take-home lesson or recommendation as3 Joel was mentioning before related to how should4 we intervene with schools?5 MS. GIBBONS: Okay. I think, first6 of all, we need to intervene with the people that7 are there in place, the school nurses that are8 there. We need to ensure that all students have9 access to a school nurse who can manage the health 10 team and the wellness activities that will then11 filter down through other providers. It takes a12 mix of a certified school nurse, RN's, LPN,13 unlicensed providers to provide the realm and the14 range of healthcare that our students need in15 school each day, but the case management of that16 needs to fall to a professional provider such as17 the school nurse because we're there with the18 students. We know their families. We see them on19 a daily basis. The physician may see them once a20 month, once every six weeks, once every six21 months. We see our children everyday and are in a22 position to do a lot of that case management which23 always includes preventive education and health24 promotion.Page 39 1 MR. ARNOLD: Some schools don't have 2 a school nurse -- sort of presents a problem in a3 time period where we're starting to see Type 24 diabetes in children for the first time in5 history, you know, and we're getting to the point6 where things like peanut allergies are becoming7 more common and multiple health complaints in8 children that we really had not seen or9 contemplated so what is your experience with that? 10 Do you see an increase or what --11 MS. GIBBONS: We see a drastic12 increase, but it's only based on antidotical13 evidence because currently the state of Illinois14 and the State Board of Education do not collect15 statistics on chronic disease in schools, on16 number of nurses visits, on number of treatments17 given. We don't have that data to really say this18 is what we need and it's really very difficult.19 We make decisions every day based on the welfare20 of the children that we see on an individual21 basis, but making policy decisions and staffing22 decisions is really difficult with that concrete23 data and because most schools do not have24 electronic health records or the nurse has thePage 40 1 castoff computer that two or three other people 2 have already upgraded from, getting that data does3 present a problem.4 MR. ARNOLD: And any other questions5 from my panel members regarding this?6 MR. AFRICK: Just one question. Is7 there one state or two states that you think do8 the best job in the US in terms of student health9 in school nurses? 10 MS. GIBBONS: Actually, yes.11 Delaware has a mandate to have a school nurse in12 every building. Iowa also has a mandate.13 Delaware has actually met theirs. Iowa is still14 in the process of doing that. A lot of the15 difference is the diversity and the geography of16 the state that makes it more difficult, I think,17 in Illinois for us to do some of those things.18 Delaware is a very small state where the schools19 communicate and they have a limited number of20 school districts. Illinois has a huge number of21 school districts to work with who all seem to want22 to do their own thing.23 MR. ARNOLD: Okay. Very good.24 Thank you very much. For the members -- when youPage 41 1 step up to the mic again, state your name and 2 spell it and for those of us that are part of the3 Task Force make sure you say your name so the4 recorder can actually put your name in for your5 question as well. We're not doing that.6 MR. SAMPSON: Good morning. My name7 is Reverend Dr. Al Sampson. I'm the pastor of8 Fernwood United Methodist Church, which is located9 in the Roseland area, 10057 South Wallace if 10 anyone would like to attend. We're the only11 church in black America that has a Department of12 Agriculture within our church. I've been there 3513 years. Thirty-two out of the 35 years I've took14 my own time and money and went back into the15 south, hooked up with black colleges that have16 departments of agriculture like Florida A & M and17 Tuskegee, they work with black farmers that are in18 co-ops and I produced a marriage the last 32 years19 between the black farmer down south and the black20 consumer up north. On top of that, we've been21 working down in the Pembroke area for the last 3222 years, a brother named Paul Ivy and Brother John23 Thurman and other farmers down in that area. I've24 taken my own time and money and brought them up toPage 42 1 open air farmer market sites. We have been just 2 about all over the city.3 On Wednesdays, we had farmer4 market sites at Covenant Bank on the west side of5 Chicago, Reverend Bill Winston's bank, and then on6 Wednesday at Segway we've had farmer market sites.7 The reason I'm concerned about this particular8 broker view is because we believe that the seeds9 in the genetic engineering is what is producing 10 the obesity, the diabetes. Everyone has seen and11 I assume the panel has seen the Food Desert12 Report. The tragedy of the report is that it does13 say that the grocery stores are too far away and14 the foods that we eat are causing the diseases15 that we have within the African-American and16 Latino community. What the proposal does not say,17 what the report does not say, is that franchises18 have now inundated our community with bad food and19 that's not in the report because the franchises20 have substituted any level of quality of food that21 our people would eat, especially children.22 I'm going to leave, if I may,23 all of my documentation. We're working -- I see24 Brother Salim Al-Nuriddin here. We're workingPage 43 1 with the health consortium on not only the 2 delivery of the food, but now we're moving towards3 a nutrition department within our organization,4 which is called George Washington Carver farms5 which is Farmer's Agriculture Resource Management6 Systems. We're collaborating with him and his7 organization because of the preparation of food.8 There's nothing wrong with the tomato, but it is9 what you do with the tomato. So we're talking 10 about healing from the ground, utilizing the11 various colors of food and what they actually12 mean. Most of our people get trapped on taste13 versus what is the nutritional value of food.14 Lastly, there are two quick15 points that frustrate us within our communities.16 Popeye never gave Olive Oil any spinach, which17 means he didn't want her to be strong. Popeye is18 up in our neighborhood with chicken and biscuits19 and no spinach which means somebody don't want us20 to be strong.21 The black woman went into the22 kitchen to prepare greens and when she came back23 she had a jar called a mason jar. Inside the24 mason jar was the pot liquor, which was thePage 44 1 nutritional and medicinal nutrient value of the 2 juice. The little child asks grandma \"Why you3 keep giving us this juice and not the actual4 greens?\" And she answered with the nutrition.5 She said \"What do you call this, momma?\" She said6 \"I call this pot liquor.\" The problem in our7 community now, Brother Joel, is that we are8 getting inundated with pot and liquor. We need9 grandma to come back with the menu. Thank you. 10 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much.11 Really astounding. This is really why I'm so12 happy with this. It's been two and a half years13 working on this issue and trying to work on14 alignment. There's so many programs within the15 community that is outstanding and we don't know16 that they're there. We need to have these things17 annotated. This is really what the purpose of18 this meeting is. One question I have for you is19 how many people do you service and what is the20 total size of your operation?21 MR. SAMPSON: Because we don't have22 the grocery stores and because we're the only23 group -- ethnic group of people in black -- in24 America, there is no home for the black farmer.Page 45 1 There are 650 black mayors in black America. 2 Nowhere is there a wholesale, retail warehouse.3 There is no distribution center. So we have to4 utilize the black church. We only do our program5 basically through the summer and we have an6 excellent strategy now as you'll see in my7 documentation. Cease Fire was one of our folks8 along with one more time Brother Salim9 Al-Nuriddin's organization, Chicago State opened 10 up their door two days for us with the Black11 Farmers Project.12 So to quantify numbers our13 genius was that we have churches within our14 network that pick up the vegetables on Saturday.15 They leaf it and we go up on black media, WVON and16 other radio stations identifying where these sites17 are and then on Sunday we have a mega church like18 Bishop Larry Trotter who has Sweet Holy Spirit.19 So on the 7:00 service, the 9:00 service and the20 11:00 service all the farmers from Arkansas,21 Mississippi, Alabama, from Illinois, all of those22 that -- all those vegetables that don't get sold23 on Saturday we bring them to the mega churches and24 they are able to sell them.Page 46 1 If we had a warehouse, we could 2 utilize that warehouse to provide economic3 development. There's a thing in the industry that4 is called added value. Down in Florida A & M, for5 $60,000 they have a collard green cutting machine6 where the farmers grow the green, wash them, cut7 them and put them in the refrigerator and that8 gives added value for frozen greens. For $3,0009 or $4,000, we could get a pea sheller and those of 10 you who know about the crowder bean and the butter11 beans, you can go on and add value to it. So it's12 not just Roseland, not just my church. It's13 several churches in the 20 black wards, which are14 impacted by our process.15 MR. ARNOLD: Excellent. If I16 remember one statement that Congressman Rush made17 to me a while ago, it was -- he said \"You can find18 potatoes and tomatoes anywhere on the west side19 and south side of Chicago\" and he said \"1420 different flavors of potato chips and tomato21 ketchups in a bottle\" and he said that's about as22 far as it goes.23 MR. SAMPSON: Also, Doctor, one of24 the things on that point, soul food restaurantsPage 47 1 are being challenged now. I have soul food 2 restaurants that were paying $28 a bushel for3 greens, whereas my farmers were able to get it to4 delivery from Illinois from Pembroke and other5 little towns like that for less than $10 -- $5 to6 $10 a bushel for greens.7 So we haven't really brought in8 the economics of this. I'm very much concerned9 about seeds. So the farmers that I'm working with 10 they grow the food they eat and no farmer in their11 right mind would grow -- drop the seed and throw a12 whole lot of pesticides and turn back around and13 say they're blessing over their dead food. What14 we're finding, just the other day this summer,15 there was lettuce, the iceberg lettuce comes in16 our community, but the romaine lettuce had a17 recall. Black farmers' vegetables have never had18 a recall because they grow the food they eat with19 a limited amount of pesticides because they're all20 in co-ops. Whether it's five acres of land or a21 hundred acres of land, they're all in a22 cooperative. The black community wasn't disturbed23 about the romaine lettuce because it doesn't come24 to our community.Page 48 1 Two years ago, it was spinach. 2 There was an e-coli recall on spinach because even3 the organic people end up getting their manure4 from the cow and they turn back around and put it5 on the spinach and then sell it to the consumer.6 We'd like you to really be sensitive to the role7 that the black farmer has played inside of our8 culture so that we can develop a sensible delivery9 system. 10 We're the only group of people11 in this town and other cities around the country12 where the franchise movement from Kentucky Fried13 to Popeye, et cetera, are more in our neighborhood14 coupled with the Food Desert Report which says15 that the food we eat from the grocery stores is16 causing us the diseases that we have. This is17 documented from LaSalle Bank and Marie -- I know18 you all know about the Food Desert. If not, I19 have the documentation.20 MR. ARNOLD: Yes, that would be21 great to submit it to the Task Force and also one22 of the things it also sounds like it's been23 implied in what you're saying, too, is that there24 is a potential for job production not just inPage 49 1 growing and being a farmer, but also in transport, 2 the transport business. So that's interesting.3 MR. SAMPSON: There's only about two4 agriculture schools in black America. I believe5 there's one still in Philadelphia and the one here6 in Chicago in the 19th Ward. It's interesting7 most of the black students that come out of that8 agricultural school go south to black colleges,9 Tuskegee, Florida A & M, et cetera. 10 We also see it as another way of11 bringing our young people back from these land12 grant schools and let them understand the impact13 of the preparation of food which is where we are14 now.15 Our food has been inundated with16 a whole lot of meats to give flavor versus looking17 at the science of why is the tomato a tomato and18 why is a lettuce, lettuce? And what is the19 nutrient value, but what is the value of eating it20 if you're going to dark it up? That's like taking21 an ice creme cone and putting a hamburger on the22 ice creme cone. It doesn't make any sense. So23 we're moving a switch with our grandparents24 raising grandchildren to be able to say to themPage 50 1 when you sit at the table now, let's look at the 2 preparation.3 MR. ARNOLD: Any quick questions4 from any of the panel members or Task Force5 members?6 MR. SAMPSON: When you don't get7 questions, that means you did good or --8 MR. ARNOLD: It means you did great.9 You did a great job. Very impressive. 10 MR. GREEN: Good morning, everybody.11 My name is Yihoodah Green. I am a psychiatrist12 and family practitioner representing Healing Hands13 Research Center and the Whole Person Project. Our14 CEO is Dr. Valencia Green. My name is spelled.15 Y-I-H-O-O-D-A-H. Last name is Green like the16 color. The Whole Person Project is a Healthy17 People 2020 focused initiative. It targets North18 Lawndale, one of 77 neighborhoods in Chicago.19 North Lawndale is plagued by multiple social20 stressors including high levels of poverty, poor21 educational outcomes, crime, criminal justice22 involvement and health disparity. North Lawndale,23 like many of the basic health resources, including24 access to -- places to buy good food as thePage 51 1 Reverend just mentioned. 2 In comparison to most other3 Chicago communities in Illinois, national4 statistics, North Lawndale has higher rates of5 obesity, diabetes, strokes, cancer, asthma, HIV,6 STD, mental illness, substance dependance and7 infant mortality. It is clear that social8 stressors directly impact health related9 attitudes, behavior and outcomes. This project 10 recognizes as does Healthy People 2020 that health11 and health service implementation must be12 considered in a socioeconomic context.13 Thank you. Dr. Fielding, who14 was the chair of the Secretary Advisory Committee15 in health promotion and disease objectives for16 2020 stated \"We can't achieve what we want without17 looking at education, jobs, public health18 infrastructure, recognizing that poverty is a19 poison.\" It can't just be left to the public20 health. We need our elected leaders to think21 about health implementation of what they do, tax22 policies, mass transit, agriculture subsidies. We23 need people in all sectors to be thinking about24 health implementations. One of the things thatPage 52 1 you mentioned is what is the best thing that we 2 can do to help prevention. The first thing we3 have to do is infiltrate the communities we want4 to present the prevention in. We cannot be5 perceived as outside entities within the6 community. If we're perceived as outside7 entities, the community won't listen to what we're8 trying to say. No matter how effective, no matter9 how good it is, the community won't listen 10 because, again, just like your body if it's11 perceived as an outsider it will reject it.12 That being said, the policies13 that are made in DC, the policies that are made in14 Springfield are great policies, but what are the15 real life implementations of those, have those16 policies be considered in the socioeconomic17 context of the people that you're talking to, as18 the Reverend mentioned, if you don't have a19 grocery store -- and I have a big sign saying eat20 healthy and I don't have a grocery store to eat21 healthy at, what is the implementation of that22 policy?23 This project recognizes that24 community, family and the student body andPage 53 1 willingness to participate in services is the core 2 of effective service strategy. Buy-in requires a3 service delivery strategy which is culturally and4 socially competent. Such a strategy requires5 seven key components which may be best understood6 in the context of attending a party. First of7 all, you have to get an invitation, follow the8 community leads. Community base requests, support9 and input on services is key to community 10 implementation of services. Two, understand the11 role of a guest. Healthcare providers should12 behave as a guest rather than the host of the13 party. This requires establishing and conducting14 a service environment in which service recipients15 receive treatment as a partnership and that16 ultimately they are in control of their healthcare17 decisions.18 Three, make sure the party is19 accessible. Providing services in an environment20 which is accessible, familiar and comfortable to21 the service participants. Four, don't be a wall22 flower. Let people know you're at the party.23 That means aggressive, culturally and socially24 competent marketing of services. Five, know howPage 54 1 to dance. That means culturally competent 2 provision of services. Six, get the digits. In3 other words, get the phone numbers. Establish4 mechanisms to maintain regular contact with5 service recipients and, seven, stay connected.6 Establish a tightly woven network of service7 providers to ensure the integration, continuity8 and time-sensitive provision of follow-up9 services. Thank you. 10 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much.11 You know, that's one of the things that -- some12 people know my background. I was in the military13 for 26 years. I did a couple of tours in Iraq,14 but also Katrina, 9/11 and that kind of thing.15 One of the things that hit me particularly was16 when I was in Katrina was the disconnect between17 two particular issues and there are two different18 questions. One is how and the other is why. And19 many times we get stuck on the how part of it. So20 it's the scientific part that says this is the21 crucible of the perfect elixir. It's22 scientifically valid and we did all these studies23 on it. We know it takes care of the problem, but24 what people usually ask you when you go intoPage 55 1 crisis situations, which many communities are in 2 presently, is the question of why. Why should I3 listen to you and that's really based on your4 philosophical viewpoint, your economical5 background, your geopolitical situation, your6 socioeconomic status, your education level. Many,7 many things are implied in that so I'm glad you're8 bringing this up.9 This is the bridge we have to 10 cross in order to get community engagement and11 without community engagement nothing is12 successful. That is the person who is actually13 using the products that you're trying to bring to14 them, the solution. But if no one takes it, then15 it's worthless. So we're making worthless answers16 to problems that people don't want to participate17 with. So we really need to cross that bridge. I18 really commend you for that.19 Specifically, what would you do20 to intervene to change that? I see the seven21 different principles you've listed and outlined,22 but do you think it's the education that needs to23 be brought --24 MR. GREEN: The first thing we needPage 56 1 to do is we can't be considered a standalone. We 2 have to integrate the community. One of the3 things this project is proposing just as the4 school nurse stated, we want to open a school5 based clinic. Now all the parents know where the6 school is. These are community based schools so,7 in other words, they're within three to four8 blocks of where the parents would be. So access9 to this place is easy. 10 It's in a context, not in a11 hospital, not in a quote, unquote, clinic. It's12 in the context that people are familiar with to13 begin with and that helps to lend itself towards14 feeling more comfortable, feeling more ready to15 connect with services.16 MR. ARNOLD: Okay. Excellent. Very17 MR. ARNOLD: Any other questions? A20 quick question. Okay. If we can have the group21 here move down so you don't lose your space and22 you can come up here. Anyone who wants to come up23 to the front, these seats are opening up for24 prevention. Then we're going to move onto ourPage 57 1 next grouping. Okay. We can go on. 2 MR. TINSLEY: My name is Elton3 Tinsley. First name is E-L-T-O-N, last name4 T-I-N-S-L-E-Y, M.D. I am Dr. Tinsley, a plastic5 surgeon and wound care specialist. I represent6 Solutions in Sync. I'm presenting a program7 called Healed and Home, wound care recommendations8 to approve outcomes and reduce costs to the state9 of Illinois. The three key elements to our wound 10 care recommendations are as follows. First,11 staff. The bullet point here a, dedicated wound12 care nurse certified in wound care. Second,13 physicians, bullet, a relationship with a14 physician who has a passion and commitment to15 wound care. Thirdly, treatments. Bullet,16 cost-effective, evidence based products and17 protocols.18 Illinois has approximately 1,20019 long-term care facilities serving more than20 100,000 residents. These facilities are licensed,21 regulated and inspected at least annually by the22 Illinois Department of Public Health. The state23 relies on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid24 Services, also known as CMS, for best practicePage 58 1 recommendations. 2 CMS relies on the National3 Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, known as NPUAP, for4 recommendations. According to the NPUAP, the5 presence of a pressure ulcer increases length of6 stay, readmission rate and commiserate increases7 in cost to the state from hospitals from the8 community and from long-term care facilities.9 I.e., nursing homes. The total cost of wound care 10 related to pressure sores was estimated in 2008 to11 be $8.5 billion. The national rate for pressure12 ulcer development in long-term care facilities is13 11.9 percent and the rate for pressure ulcer14 development in the state of Illinois is slightly15 higher at 13.1 percent as of 2009.16 In fact, 86.9 of the pressure17 ulcers managed and treated in Illinois nursing18 homes are community acquired. Nursing home19 residents with wounds are admitted to nursing20 homes with wounds. The goal of the Healed and21 Home program is to expedite wound healing, reduce22 both the costs and number of pressure ulcers in23 the Illinois long-term care facilities and return24 residents to their primary residence.Page 59 1 In the 11 Illinois facilities 2 that have currently implemented the Healed to Home3 program, the acquired pressure ulcer rates varied4 from zero percent to three percent. Keep in mind,5 the national average is 11.9 percent. Healed to6 Home is divided into prevention and treatment. I7 will now elaborate on the staff model. As a best8 practice model, each facility has at least one9 nurse that is wound care certified. The wound 10 care nurse is responsible for assessing all11 residents with and without pressure ulcers. They12 can then identify risk factors and put into place13 an individualized wound prevention plan based on14 CMS guidelines already established.15 Wound prevention is the most16 cost-effective measure to the state, the family17 and the community. According to the published18 literature, staff education is the key to wound19 prevention. The wound care nurse would also be20 responsible for educating the remainder of the21 staff, the resident and our families on the22 importance of wound prevention. These findings23 are to be shared at the regular quality assurance24 meetings already established.Page 60 1 If a resident has or develops a 2 wound, SWAT is implemented and in our program SWAT3 means special wound aggressive treatment. The4 wound care nurse develops a treatment plan in5 compliance with the established guidelines already6 established. This nurse monitors the wound and7 documents at least weekly on the progress.8 Oversight is provided by the9 director of nursing, already established, and 10 further the local physician on an as-needed basis11 and can report it in the quality insurance12 meetings that are already established.13 The physician model, as a best14 practice model, a physician with a compassion and15 commitment to wound care is an integral part of16 the team. Physician collaboration with the wound17 care nurse through either on-site rounds or18 telephone case discussion provide for additional19 expertise in treating and healing these wounds.20 Physician education to both the21 wound care nurse and facilities staff allow for22 increased knowledge in the prevention and23 treatment of wounds. Physician input enhances the24 use of evidence based wound care modalities in thePage 61 1 treatment and healing of wounds. The treatments 2 model, as a best practice model, appropriate3 treatments will be applied in the appropriate4 manner on the appropriate wounds. Best practices5 are ultimately cost-effective regardless of6 initial treatment costs. The most expensive wound7 care dressing may not be the most effective in8 expediting wound healing. The least expensive9 wound care dresses may not be the most effective 10 over time in expediting wound healing. Utilizing11 evidence based practices when deciding on12 prevention and treatment options mitigates wound13 development and results in faster healing time and14 return to home.15 In summary, Healed to Home as a16 best practice model reduces wound care costs to17 the state at no cost to the state, reduces the18 incidents of wound development in nursing homes,19 heals existing wounds faster and finally is20 cost-effective for nursing homes to implement.21 Thank you.22 MR. ARNOLD: Excellent, Dr. Tinsley.23 This is really a phenomenal use. This is really24 one of the leading healthcare costs that we have,Page 62 1 especially with hospitalizations and 2 rehospitalizations to nursing homes. One of the3 things I wanted to ask you, how many wounds do you4 see in an average month?5 MR. TINSLEY: Me, personally, I see6 about 60 a week. So about 250 a month, but I only7 cover three out of the 11 nursing homes.8 MR. ARNOLD: Wow. How do you9 determine which dressing is best for a given 10 wound?11 MR. TINSLEY: Actually, that's a12 very good question. What is more important is not13 the etiology of the wound, but the cause of the14 wound. What is more important is the current15 condition of the wound and I think the greatest16 impact in terms of cost savings to the state is17 with progressive education of the staff -- is to18 minimize the number of nursing home residents that19 are transported out of the nursing home for wound20 care when wound care can be delivered in the21 nursing home. The state's transportation cost22 just round trip to a wound care facility is $40023 to $600. So that's $800 a roundtrip. Multiply24 that by 13,000 wounds and that's a lot of money.Page 63 1 MR. ARNOLD: How many different 2 types of wounds do you see?3 MR. TINSLEY: Typically, we see them4 all. The most common is the pressure ulcer.5 There's eight different types of wounds including6 lacerations, pressure ulcers, burns, every now and7 then we'll get a surgical patient with a cancer8 wound in a nursing home, but without question the9 number one or most common wound is the pressure 10 wound.11 MR. ARNOLD: And that's from not12 rotating the patient and movement and --13 MR. TINSLEY: You have to keep in14 mind regardless of what those 2:00 a.m. illegal15 commercials are saying about nursing homes, you16 have to keep in mind almost 90 percent of the17 wounds in a nursing home actually came from18 outside into the nursing home.19 MR. ARNOLD: Any other questions20 from the panel members?21 MR. AFRICK: Can you submit to the22 Task Force the calculation of the cost savings23 that the state would receive by changing its24 approach to wound care?Page 64 1 MR. TINSLEY: In our three 2 facilities, we've significantly reduced cost and I3 think we can provide that actual calculation when4 we're working with the state and actually have the5 state numbers and we can tell you what the impact6 would be.7 MR. AFRICK: Thank you.8 MR. ARNOLD: Fantastic. Do you9 think there's a need for education also for people 10 at home since these are coming in from the11 outside?12 MR. TINSLEY: There is no downside13 to education from kindergarten to the nursing14 home.15 MR. ARNOLD: Okay. Next presenter,16 please. Do you have any records you want to17 submit? You can hand them to my timekeeper. You18 can move up to the next level. You can move down19 one seat to fill this in.20 MR. ALSBERRY: Good morning.21 MR. ARNOLD: Alsberry,24 A-L-S-B-E-R-R-Y, Junior. There's a third runningPage 65 1 around out there. 2 My organization is the Kid's3 Health Club. I am the vice president and Diane4 Alsberry is the president. The Kid's Health Club5 opened November 19th, 2005. This is the idea of6 Diane, who is a physical therapist and, myself,7 who is a physical therapist assistant, Vernard8 Alsberry. The mission of Kid's Health Club is to9 be an advocate for healthy lifestyle changes for 10 children and families and to develop products and11 services that make fitness fun.12 On August 27th, 2010, a13 not-for-profit arm of the Kid's Health Club was14 developed called the Kid's Health Club Foundation.15 The mission of the Kid's Health Club Foundation is16 to prevent and treat childhood obesity through17 activities, research, education, advocacy and18 promote healthy lifestyle changes to children and19 their families.20 There is an epidemic of obesity21 and inactivity in America today. Video games,22 decrease of physical education in schools, and the23 fear of letting children out alone have24 contributed to the fattening of our children andPage 66 1 lead to increased chronic health problems, 2 including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.3 The Kid's Health Club and the4 Kid's Health Club Foundation look to provide5 children a place for exercise and have fun doing6 it. The logo, which portrays a little girl and7 boy flexing their muscles with a smile says it8 all. Both organizations will not only provide9 needed exercise to youth who have spent too much 10 time playing video games, but also assist in11 prevention of injuries of children who are12 involved in sports by increasing their strength,13 flexibility and endurance.14 Diane and I have over 50 years15 of experience in the profession of physical16 therapy and have worked in all aspects of the17 profession. We both have a passion for working18 with children and understand the importance of19 fitness and health becoming a daily part of our20 children's life. KidsHealthClub.com and Kid's21 Health Club Foundation, Incorporated also provide22 nutritional classes, women workout classes and23 wellness seminars.24 In conjunction with First LadyPage 67 1 Michelle Obama's Let's Move Campaign, designed to 2 eradicate childhood obesity within a generation,3 Kid's Health Club is proposing collaboration with4 the state of Illinois to provide a fitness and5 nutrition program for its youth. Childhood6 obesity in the Chicagoland and the Southland7 mirrors national and statewide trends. Illinois8 has the 14 highest rate of childhood obesity9 between ages and 10 and 17. Research shows that 10 kids who are overweight often struggle with weight11 through their entire lives. Overweight during12 childhood and particularly adolescence is related13 to increased morbidity and mortality later in14 life. Some scientists believe the generation of15 children could be the first generation to have a16 shorter lifespan than their parents.17 The Kid's Health Club is a great18 way to exercise. We provide entertaining physical19 activity, a safe social environment with unique20 exercise equipment, which is targeted towards21 youth for goal achievement and fun while coaches22 give encouragement and provide supervision23 throughout the program. Kid's Health Club is an24 ideal program for kids who don't have enoughPage 68 1 physical activity during the school day because, 2 as I said before, a lot of programs have been3 decreased. We train kids in sports. We also4 improve kid's athletic ability and allow them to5 slim down while having fun doing the activity6 also. The kid's -- the group of kids that we work7 with are between 6 and 16 years old. We not only8 work on their self-esteem -- because a lot of kids9 who are obese or almost obese have a problem with 10 social problems also, not only chronic illnesses.11 When we found that we work with12 kids, we also take a BMI on the kid when they13 first come in. That BMI gives us a target line to14 work towards helping the kid to reduce their body15 fat. We also have found through our process that16 kids that are already in this program that have17 respiratory problems, usually we help assist them18 with improving their lung capacity. Our program19 is a circuit work program and the machines are20 made for children. They're like weight machines21 you'd see in a regular gym, but they're made for22 children by HOIST, which is out of California.23 The kids go through a circuit. They do a minute24 on the machines. They do a minute on aerobicPage 69 1 activities and the kids are there for 2 approximately one hour. We also have the3 nutrition program which we mirrored from the We4 Can program to enhance childhood activity and5 nutrition. We mirrored this program through our6 nutrition. It's a six-week program that we have7 the parents and the kids come through so they can8 understand what nutrition is, what a good thing to9 eat is, what is a bad thing to eat and how it 10 affects their bodies. I'll take some questions11 now.12 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much.13 Good presentation. This program it looks like14 it's housed inside a mall structure, which is15 really ideal because you have a lot of traffic16 going through. What is the -- and you probably17 have security as well --18 MR. ALSBERRY: Yes.19 MR. ARNOLD: -- in the environment?20 But how many people do you see and what types of21 metrics do you use in order to measure the22 effectiveness of the intervention?23 MR. ALSBERRY: Being a physical24 therapist, we're always looking for outcomes. SoPage 70 1 when we start a program, we make up a sheet that 2 initially when they come in what can they really3 do when they first come in. We take a BMI and4 then we take a chart and show each machine to see5 how much resistance they can handle when they6 first come in. From that, we have coaches. Our7 coaches usually come from the high school. We8 train -- they're juniors and seniors in high9 school. We train them how to work with our kids 10 and to fall into our program. So the first week11 they come in, they may be doing a one arm machine,12 it's about twelve pounds and that's about two or13 three weeks we check them out again and see where14 they're at, whether they're ready to move up or15 move down. Diane and I do that and then we'll16 move the kids up. Usually the machines go up to17 about 120 pounds and some go to 160 pounds. Most18 kids get up to maybe about 80 or 90 pounds. The19 machines are interactive. They're not like adult20 machines when a child gets on the machine. The21 machine moves also. It provides them close chain22 exercises. So that at -- some study shows that if23 you use machines that aren't close chain exercise24 machines, it could damage their growth rates, butPage 71 1 the study is not true, but to be on the safe side, 2 because science changes all the time, we're3 deciding to use these machines because it provides4 that protection for the youths when they come to5 the program. We also have our regular treadmills6 and stair masters also.7 MR. ARNOLD: And you're associated8 also with the tumbling team or gymnastics team?9 MR. ALSBERRY: We have the Pink 10 Panthers double dutch team who practices in our11 facility also and we partner with the township.12 We ran a summer program. In the summer youth13 camps, which they have already in the park14 districts, what we do is instead of going to a15 baseball game or bowling alley, they come to the16 Kid's Health Club and they come there maybe three17 or four times during the summer and we work that18 program with the park district. We also have a19 nutrition component, which we ran with Country20 Club Hills. For the kids in the morning, they21 were in our nutrition class. In the afternoon,22 they came over to the Kid's Health Club and23 exercised. We ran a program through Governor's24 State University where we took a group of kids, IPage 72 1 think it was 20 youths, we kept them for two 2 months and during that process they had to go3 through nutrition components. We also took their4 BMI's and monitored them throughout the program.5 We've seen maybe over 800 kids6 in the five years. That's not counting the7 nutrition programs we've done. We've done8 healthcare workshops where we partnered with the9 Illinois Department of Public Health, Advocate 10 Hospital, St. James Hospital, where they come in11 and do screenings on the youth and during that12 screening time we allow them to come into the13 Kid's Health Club and exercise.14 Once they finish their15 exercises, we do have interactive video games. We16 have the DVR, we have the Wii games. So once they17 finish their circuit, which lasts about 45 or 5018 minutes then they're free to play their19 interactive video games, which also helps to keep20 them active throughout and a lot of times we find21 out they work harder playing on the games then22 working the circuit, but they have fun and they're23 sweaty when they workout.24 MR. ARNOLD: Any other questionsPage 73 1 from the Task Force? Thank you very much. 2 MS. COLBORN: Good morning. My name3 is Erna Colborn, E-R-N-A, I'm4 president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Association5 Greater Illinois Chapter and I represent the6 Illinois Chapter Network, which is our public7 policy consortium made up of the four chapters8 that serve the state of Illinois.9 I appreciate the opportunity to 10 speak with you today about Alzheimer's disease and11 health promotion. Alzheimer's disease is the most12 underrecognized public health crisis of the 21st13 century. There are as many as 5.3 million persons14 today living with Alzheimer's, which is the most15 common form of dementia. Alzheimer's is a disease16 that destroys brain cells and causes problems with17 memory, thinking and behavior. It is not a normal18 part of aging. Today, it is the sixth leading19 cause of death in the United States. One in eight20 Americans age 65 and older have Alzheimer's and21 another American develops Alzheimer's every 7022 seconds. Unless something is done by 2050, up to23 16 million Americans will have Alzheimer's and a24 new case will be diagnosed every 33 seconds.Page 74 1 Currently, in Illinois, the 2 number of persons with Alzheimer's is 210,000 and3 that number is expected to increase by 14 percent4 over the next 15 years. Although the cause or5 causes of Alzheimer's disease are not yet known,6 most experts agree that Alzheimer's, like other7 common chronic conditions, probably develop as a8 result of multiple factors rather than a single9 cause. 10 An increasing role by public11 health officials provides a new front in12 addressing cognitive health in our society. We13 are well aware that cognitive health is a vital14 part of healthy aging and quality of life. The15 lack of cognitive health will not only have a16 significant impact on a person's well-being and17 overall health status, but that of our community18 and our state as well.19 The rising incidents of20 Alzheimer's and related dementia is a public21 health battle that we in Illinois must be prepared22 to respond to with services and resources to23 support the person with the disease, their family24 and their caregivers. We applaud IllinoisPage 75 1 dedication to use of surveillance as a public 2 health tool to develop data on the incidents,3 problems and risk factors for particular diseases4 and when risk factors are identified to support5 the development and strategies to reduce risk.6 Surveillance at the state or7 community level can identify hot spots where8 resources could be deployed in order to reduce9 incidents of prevalence and bend the cost curves 10 of diseases. In cooperation with the CDC,11 Illinois conducts the BRFSS, Behavior Risk Factor12 Surveillance System. We're very pleased that in13 2009 the state included the optional module on14 caregiving and we're even more pleased the15 cognitive impairment module be in the survey16 conducted in 2011.17 Effective surveillance on18 cognitive impairment and caregiving produces the19 state information about the impact of cognitive20 impairment, the number of family caregivers, the21 age, income, living arrangements, health problems,22 and other characteristics of those with the23 condition and their caregivers. With this24 information, we can support and guide campaigns toPage 76 1 increase public awareness of Alzheimer's, help 2 policymakers understand that Alzheimer's disease,3 cognitive impairment and caregiving are major4 health problems that require focused planning as5 new interventions to reduce risks in societal6 impacts and support collaboration with Illinois7 public health department to include Alzheimer's8 and dementia as part of your prevention9 initiatives and other serious medical conditions. 10 We soon will have state specific11 valuable data to identify the impact of12 Alzheimer's and other conditions on Illinois13 citizens and to highlight the need for planning14 interventions, programs and services in Illinois15 to reduce the risk and impact. With this in mind,16 the Alzheimer's Association supports the inclusion17 of these two optional modules in the Illinois18 Public Health Surveillance Program on a19 continuing, regular basis.20 Let 2009 and 2011 be the start21 of regular surveillance on these important issues.22 The incidents of Alzheimer's is rising. We need23 to know its impact on Illinois in order to provide24 a sound public health policy response knowing thatPage 77 1 a strategic response to the emerging public health 2 crisis of Alzheimer's will be needed to protect3 all Illinois citizens. Thank you.4 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much for5 that testimony. That was phenomenal. This is6 definitely one of those issues that we must keep7 in the forefront with an aging population. Also,8 the interaction of this -- I was mentioning to9 someone before the meeting started that sometimes 10 we have a tendency to give people a diagnosis and11 we think that stops everything else from happening12 and so you have depression then you don't have13 colon cancer and you don't have other things going14 on, but we're saying two-thirds of adults are15 overweight with obesity that's going to intersect16 with things like Alzheimer's and the person's17 ability to care for themselves and also with18 injury prevention.19 So all these things are sort of20 implied when you start talking about complicating21 any kind of disease state. It's difficult enough22 to take care of things if you are mentally here23 and able to focus on everything you're doing, but24 when that happens and without, you know, thePage 78 1 families having support, without having a support 2 structure or strong family then you have more3 problems and this is something that we need to4 keep a very sharp focus on, but any comments from5 anyone else on the Task Force on this issue?6 Thank you very much and please include your7 testimony. Thank you.8 MS. WILSON: Good afternoon. Good9 morning. Janette Wilson, J-A-N-E-T-T-E, 10 W-I-L-S-O-N. I represent -- unlike everyone else,11 I represent those who give hope and good news as12 well as those who challenge the system. One13 concern I have as I look at this panel is the14 disparity that you represent by your failure to15 represent a preponderance of the population in the16 state of Illinois and that is women.17 I don't know how you could have18 a Task Force and not have more women represented19 in as much as we bring you into the world, we20 carry you through the world, and then we take you21 out of the world.22 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you.23 MS. WILSON: And since you all have24 been so quiet, I just figured you need a woman toPage 79 1 tell a village about what is going on. 2 MR. ARNOLD: We have 19 members. We3 do probably have some women, but we should have 184 of the 19.5 MS. WILSON: I'm very disturbed.6 I'm here representing the faith community incase7 you didn't know, but when I see no women up there8 you all need to recruit some from the audience.9 MR. ARNOLD: One lady she was here, 10 but she had to leave.11 MS. WILSON: I got that.12 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you.13 MS. WILSON: But we do respect the14 fact that you're here on the Task Force and I will15 not read my testimony, but it is printed and I16 gave it to one of the staff members for17 distribution to all the panel members. One of the18 things that I wanted to rise and speak to is an19 untapped resource within every state within this20 nation and even around the world and that is the21 faith community.22 We provide the best23 communication system that you could have to24 communicate information about chronic diseases,Page 80 1 treatment, prevention, opportunities. We are 2 greater communicators than most media outlets that3 you tend to use. Our strength was evidenced when4 the H1N1 flu vaccination program was initiated in5 Illinois this year. We were able to communicate6 to our members and to a broader cross section7 through our broadcast media, through our inserts8 in our weekly bulletins and communicated across9 pulpits without regard to faith the value of being 10 inoculated against H1N1. The other thing which11 the faith community provides that most public12 health institutions forget or ignore is that we13 are the largest facility for deploying resources,14 providing temporary and emergency shelter. We are15 locations that can provide food on a temporary or16 even a permanent basis for numbers of people. We17 can be centers for deploying volunteers,18 recruiting volunteers and we would be great19 nutrition sites for communities, particularly in20 rural and suburban areas, for in those food21 deserts that Reverend Sampson talked about we need22 to be connected because we are also the grief23 counselors.24 We are the people that when aPage 81 1 crisis occurs or when a child or a parent is obese 2 or has a chronic disease or has an illness that3 appears to be terminable, the first person that4 they reached to is a member of the faith community5 generally.6 We are oftentimes the first7 responders to a crisis, but the last to get the8 correct information to communicate. So we provide9 transportation. We have buses and vans that could 10 be deployed. We have great communication systems.11 We have shelters. We have food and we have12 clothing. We can organize people. We can inspire13 people to act and we can do several things. So14 we're suggesting that, one, this Task Force should15 have a faith leader represented and it can rotate16 so you can cover all of the major faith traditions17 in Illinois. Secondly, the Illinois Department of18 Public Health should have a seat at its emergency19 response table for the faith community.20 We're tired of being the last21 call and not at the table when decisions are being22 made about our constituents that God has placed in23 our hands. We know that if you look at childhood24 obesity and the failure to have good nutrition itPage 82 1 starts in the home. We're the closest to the 2 home. So, oftentimes, faith leaders are not3 transmitting healthy information to their4 parishioners. So there needs to be a stronger5 partnership.6 I'm probably the least obese7 person in the room and it's not by accident. I8 started out -- in my first 15 years, I ate9 vegetables from the farms that Reverend Sampson 10 talked about. I didn't know what it was like to11 eat from a grocery store. My grandparents raised12 everything I ate, including the meat. So it was13 not processed food and I did not go home to obese14 parents. They did not eat potato chips. I didn't15 have fast food until I was a teenager and it was16 without the permission of my parents.17 These children eat everyday in18 school and out of school red hots, Pepsi. I did19 not give my daughter soft drinks until she was old20 enough to make that decision. So juice and fruits21 and vegetables are not the common meal in schools,22 they're not common in the home nor are they common23 in many of our institutions that our children24 frequent on a regular basis. You can't change thePage 83 1 behavior without changing the messages that are 2 going forth from every part of the community and3 that's why the faith community becomes critical in4 partnership with the Department of Public Health5 and with this Task Force. Are there any6 questions?7 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much.8 That was very, very insightful. You gave some9 very strong points, Reverend Wilson. You also -- 10 I know you have the school background, the legal11 background so I think this is really the trust12 level that you're talking about within the faith13 based institution which has born itself out and we14 have worked on many different programs together.15 MS. WILSON: That's right.16 MR. ARNOLD: With the H1N1 response17 and the faith based organizations actually played18 a critical role with that in saving lives within19 the state. There were multiple organizations,20 over 500 faith based institutions that21 participated. About two months ago, the CDC22 released some statistics and noted with respect to23 the ten largest states, most populated states in24 the country, Illinois actually placed number onePage 84 1 for those over 18 and for those who were less than 2 18 second. So we have to challenge that second3 place still, but we actually have great resources4 within faith based institutions and they have a5 training program that has been in place started6 with the pandemic training program. And as far as7 the seat at the public health emergency operation8 center, granted. We have one for you. But the9 state emergency operations center, we have to talk 10 to them about that on the state level because11 that's part of the IEMA structure.12 MS. WILSON: So we have to talk to13 the governor?14 MR. ARNOLD: We'll talk to him and15 get in touch with him, but definitely because you16 have been -- not only the H1N1 response, but flood17 details. It's been very, very progressive, very18 positive. So I think all those things you were19 saying with the grief counseling, tradition -- we20 sometimes wait until the end, you know, even with21 things like Katrina's response is the most graphic22 because it was on CNN, but it happens everyday23 where these disasters occur and the churches are24 responding and we have a tendency to sort ofPage 85 1 downplay and not recognize the contributions being 2 made.3 So thank you very much for4 bringing those forward and any other questions5 from the panel?6 MR. AFRICK: Reverend Wilson, can I7 ask you about networks for reaching the faith8 based community in metropolitan Chicago and then9 expanding that statewide -- 10 MS. WILSON: Well, we have11 denominational networks within the Christian faith12 and then there is a Chicago Council of Religious13 Leaders that represent the major faith14 organizations in the city of Chicago. You will15 find in Chicago most of the faith leaders,16 nationally recognized faith leaders, are domiciled17 in the city of Chicago. Down the state, there is18 a network and we have been working with the19 Department of Public Health to create such a20 database and it certainly can be expanded upon by21 contacting the leaders of the Islamic faith, the22 Greek Orthodox faith and in the African-American23 tradition, there's the African-American -- African24 Methodist Episcopal, African Methodist EpiscopalPage 86 1 Zion, the 6th Baptist state organization, the 6th 2 Church of God in Christ of state organizations,3 Before Apostolic Faith Organizations and this not4 counting the Catholics, the Churches of Christ and5 Churches of God. So there are just a number that6 we have that we can help you communicate with,7 plus the Jewish synagogues as well, and then you8 have those Native American faith leaders as well.9 So it's a broad range that needs 10 to be included because once you include all of us11 you have included the state and most of the people12 in it except for those who do not believe in any13 God. So they should have a rotating vacancy for14 the agency.15 MR. AFRICK: Thank you.16 MR. ARNOLD: Thank very much,17 Reverend Wilson.18 MS. GRIMSHAW: Good last name20 Grimshaw, G-R-I-M-S-H-A-W. I am the executive21 director of the High Ridge YMCA in the Rogers Park22 community, which is part of the YMCA of23 Metropolitan Chicago. I'm also here representing24 the Illinois state of YMCAs. With 51 corporatePage 87 1 Y's in the state of Illinois, Y's are the perfect 2 place to cultivate healthy statewide change at the3 community level. The Y movement has worked hard4 to address the growing epidemic of obesity, which5 leads to increased health care costs due to6 preventable disease.7 The two programs discussed in8 the testimony today will be the YMCA's diabetes9 prevention program and the pioneering healthy 10 communities program. Between 1996 and 2001, the11 National Institute of Health and the Center of12 Disease Control established a Diabetes Prevention13 Program. The original DPP included one-to-one14 education in support for healthy eating and15 physical activity for the healthcare provider.16 From 2005 to 2008, the authors of this study17 collaborated with the YMCA of Greater Indianapolis18 to design, implement and evaluate a group based19 adaptation of the DPP lifestyle intervention.20 Indiana University translated a21 16-week course based on the original study which22 focused on the education and support being23 delivered in a group setting trained by Y staff.24 The result of the 92-person pilot demonstrated thePage 88 1 Y could deliver the program at a fraction of the 2 cost and achieve similar results to the national3 program. Programs such as this were successful in4 preventing or delaying the onset of Type 25 diabetes by reducing our bodyweight by six percent6 and increasing our physical activity and continue7 to maintain progress 6 and 12 months after the8 core 16 sessions.9 In April of 2010, United Health 10 Group teamed with the Y of USA to expand Y and11 DPP. Rather than simply paying high medical12 claims to customers, United Heath retained the13 YMCA's and pharmacists to keep people healthier.14 Using the model from the YMCA of Greater15 Indianapolis, Y USA has implemented the Y DPP in16 Louisville, Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton,17 Minneapolis, Phoenix, Jacksonville, Fort Wayne and18 Bloomington, Indiana, Rochester, New York,19 Delaware, Seattle and Birmingham. Y of the USA20 worked with Congress to create the Diabetes21 Prevention Act as part of the healthcare reform22 that establishes a national community diabetes23 prevention program at the Centers of Disease24 Control.Page 89 1 In September of 2010, the Y 2 announced a $50,000 grant to introduce a diabetes3 prevention program at their local Y's. YMCA's in4 Quad Cities, DeKalb and Elgin were approved to5 start Diabetes Prevention Programs in the fall of6 2010, but unfunded. The YMCA is soliciting7 private funds and advocating for Congress to8 secure additional start-up funding for the9 approved, but unfunded Y's. 10 While Y of the USA is looking to11 fund the Y's in Quad Cities, DeKalb and Elgin, we12 are also looking to partners in this work. In13 2011, Y's may choose to make a $12,500 investment14 in Y of USA to participate in the YMCA's Diabetes15 Prevention Program. The investment will provide16 access to training, curriculum, tools, resources17 and support. YMCA holds a unique advantage in18 their infrastructure from community based19 prevention programs because of the sheer number of20 locations and its ability to reach low income and21 minority populations.22 The Y also has a solution to23 prevent childhood obesity due to primary and24 healthier communities. In 2010, the IllinoisPage 90 1 State Alliance of YMCA's was named one of the 2 state's pioneering healthier communities. PHC, as3 it's known, is a statewide collaborative effort4 that focuses on healthy systems, environmental and5 policy changes that are driven by a community6 dream team of advocates and ambassadors. The7 advocates and ambassadors are a diverse group that8 starts doing the community healthy living index on9 their community. The CHLI assessment, which it's 10 also called, indicates gaps that inhibit healthy11 choices such as unsafe walk paths, lack of access12 to fresh foods and vegetables or not enough13 after-school programs emphasizing physical14 activity.15 Three statewide PHC's were16 started in 2009 in Connecticut, Kentucky and17 Tennessee. In 2010, it includes Illinois,18 Michigan and Ohio. The 12 YMCA's that are19 included in the Illinois pioneering healthy20 communities are located in Elgin, Rockford, Metro21 East, Moline, Chicagoland, DuPage County, Joliet,22 Kankakee, Oak Park, Peoria, Quincy and23 Springfield. Schaumburg not Springfield.24 These local groups support thePage 91 1 large statewide team focused on policy change at 2 the state level. Our current statewide partners3 include Illinois State Alliance of YMCA's,4 Illinois Department of Public Health, Illinois5 Alliance to Prevent Obesity, Active Transportation6 Alliance, the Illinois Chapter of American Academy7 of Pediatrics.8 The Y is planning to introduce9 our statewide pioneering and healthier community 10 roadmap in September of 2011. 2011 will focus on11 bringing our diverse group to the table and12 identifying key areas of state policy that inhibit13 all of our communities from being able to make14 healthy choices in our daily lives. Thank you.15 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much.16 You have your testimony. You can submit it for17 inclusion, but very, very stellar work with the18 YMCA's. I'm not sure of the relationship to, you19 know, YWCA's because I get asked that question and20 whether they are involved in the same process as21 well.22 MS. GRIMSHAW: The YWCA's are a23 separate affiliate. They are not affiliated.24 MR. ARNOLD: Any questions fromPage 92 1 anyone else on the Task Force? 2 MR. ISAACSON: Michael Isaacson.3 Good morning. I'm just wondering in terms of4 integration across networks for statewide planning5 you mentioned the statewide group of Y's in6 Illinois now. What do you think is the most7 important thing that needs to be done to integrate8 the Y's into anything that goes on statewide?9 MS. GRIMSHAW: If I understand your 10 question, probably a communication network. I11 know that was just mentioned before. I think that12 would help. The YMCA tries to sit at every table13 there is so we're integrated across the board, but14 communication is probably overall.15 MR. ISAACSON: Like establishing a16 formal communication network of some kind?17 MS. GRIMSHAW: Correct.18 MR. ISAACSON: Thank you.19 MR. ARNOLD: How many students are20 usually or people are usually involved in the21 program to --22 MS. GRIMSHAW: It depends from23 community to community.24 MR. ARNOLD: Okay. Thank you veryPage 93 1 much. We've sort of gone over our time a little 2 bit so if anyone wants a five minute break or keep3 going? Let's take a two-minute break.4 (Whereupon, a break was taken5 after which the following6 proceedings were had.)7 MR. ARNOLD: Okay. We're going to8 get ready to start again. We have the next9 presenter at the podium. If you can state your 10 name and spell your name and also the organization11 that you're associated with.12 MS. GADON: Good morning, members of13 the Committee. My name is Margaret Gadon,14 M-A-R-G-A-R-E-T, G-A-D-O-N. I'm a practicing15 physician in Illinois and the clinical director of16 IFMC-IL, which is most of what it does in Illinois17 is it houses the contract for the Illinois quality18 improvement organization and we are also working19 on other quality initiatives to improve care20 across the state of Illinois.21 My testimony will largely be22 general in format, but following my remarks I will23 be discussing a project, which is in preparation24 or development that does integrate many aspects ofPage 94 1 chronic disease and my remarks span both elements 2 of prevention -- primary prevention and secondary3 prevention of chronic disease.4 As you are all aware, the term5 chronic disease encompasses any condition that6 requires care over a period of time and general is7 one which is not curable. We've heard extensive8 remarks about the cost of care for chronic disease9 and I will not elaborate here. However, we do 10 know that chronic diseases caused by degeneration11 such as arthritis are a natural part of aging and12 will occur regardless of the type of preventive13 activities initiated. However, certain diseases14 are preventable. Those individuals with the15 genetic predisposition to them alter their16 environment and lifestyle, specifically diet and17 the amount of regular physical activity.18 I commend the Department of19 Public Health as well as the US Centers for20 Disease Control for developing programs at the21 population level to encourage Illinois residents22 to make changes in their diet and physical23 activity to the extent that it is within their24 personal control, that they have the sufficientPage 95 1 income to purchase healthy foods and live in an 2 environment in which there is access to affordable3 and safe physical activity. It is difficult for4 me to speak with any credibility today to the5 issue at hand which is how the state can best6 coordinate and integrate its efforts to health7 promotion and reduce chronic disease disparities8 without knowing the specifics of the various9 initiatives. 10 I am, however, aware of the 201011 State Health Improvement Plan which lays out a12 clear pathway to health promotion and chronic13 disease prevention using well accepted strategies.14 What struck me in reading over this document15 particularly in relation to those I hadn't seen16 when I was a public health physician working for17 the State Health Department of New York several18 years ago was the degree to which health reform,19 community engagement and interdisciplinary20 approaches to socioeconomic determinants of health21 were recommended. From my perspective, these22 three approaches are the essential elements to23 integration of health promotion programs.24 Regardless of the degree of integration at thePage 96 1 state level through planning, it is at the 2 community level as Dr. Arnold so eloquently3 mentioned previously where these activities are4 implemented and where the integration is most5 essential. Specifically then through health6 reform, funds for prevention should be funneled as7 much as possible to the local level where they are8 planned and implemented with the input of9 community members, including the children of that 10 community. The medical societies and hospitals11 should be elemental to this and encouraging their12 physicians or physician office teams to13 participate. This would not only help with the14 planning process, but also better link medical and15 public health services leading to reenforcement of16 prevention messaging to community residents.17 Secondly, through community18 engagement activities, if activities can be19 culturally and linguistically tailored, thereby20 increasing their likelihood of being understood,21 heard and eventually adopted, volunteers can be22 engaged thereby filling the needs of23 underresourced local health departments.24 Community ownership is morePage 97 1 likely to reenforce these activities and lead to 2 creative applications across the social spectrum3 of resident lives, and, finally, through4 interdisciplinary approaches to address5 socioeconomic determinants of health the6 environment which facilitates behavior change can7 be developed. The challenges to achieving a8 healthy lifestyle such as media messaging, unsafe9 neighborhoods, lack of park space, lack of access 10 to nutritious food and lack of solid family11 structures in with children can prosper loom large12 in many of our communities particularly in urban13 areas.14 Innovative solutions for these15 problems are likely to occur in small community16 settings with strong leadership, private public17 partnerships and a strong commitment from the18 business community and perhaps that's one of our19 greatest challenges, how to make better health for20 the public a win for business. This is a tougher21 road ahead for the state with its budgetary22 constraints, but this time also represents a great23 opportunity with increased funding for prevention24 coming from the federal government and a publicPage 98 1 increasingly aware of the issues. 2 Now, just quickly, I wanted to3 mention -- I won't mention it. Primary Care4 Extension Program --5 MR. ARNOLD: You can make one very6 quick question about it. You can put that into7 the testimony, but if you want to make a one or8 two sentence summary sort of what it is that would9 be fine. 10 MS. GADON: Yes. The Primary Care11 Extension Program is part of the Federal12 Healthcare Reform Act. The funds have not yet13 been appropriated, but there is $120 million14 intended for this program. We're not sure how15 many states are in this program. It's modelled16 after the Agricultural Extension Program. Funds17 go to the state level and then are sent to the18 local level where a hub of medical services,19 public health services and the community members20 are working to integrate care and this is run by a21 community focused health extension agent who links22 and coordinates care between these different23 groups and specifically provides coaching for the24 community residents, helps -- practices transformPage 99 1 to teen based care and the medical home and most 2 importantly actually creates an opportunity for3 those small community projects which you're4 talking about being linked to physician practice5 and incorporated into medical care to prevent both6 primary and secondary disease.7 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much.8 Very great summary. I do have time for one very9 quick question. Anyone right now? 10 MR. ISAACSON: I have one question.11 Doctor, Michael Isaacson. I'm wondering -- I12 agree with you whole heartily on the local -- the13 grass roots effort is really where the rubber14 meets the road and I think people need to know the15 importance of community and working from the16 inside. What advice do you have to this panel in17 terms of a statewide approach where we can really18 foster those efforts?19 MS. GADON: As I said, I think the20 most important thing you need is integration on21 these things and you need representatives from22 each of the communities feeding information up to23 the statewide level in a format that is easily --24 that is standardized and easily analyzed toPage 100 1 provide best practices, but unless that money is 2 channelled to a coalition at the multiple3 community levels, you're not going to have an4 opportunity to really represent the voice of the5 people and my neighbor, who is markedly6 overweight, I've seen her little girl, she comes7 in with chocolates and stuff, I'm sure she knows8 she is overweight.9 I'm sure she has heard the 10 messaging. She is not incentivized. It just11 hasn't rung home and she hasn't decided to get on12 board. Until her -- whatever makes her tic and13 that's going to be her peer relationships and her14 community incentivize her, she's going to be keep15 buying Oreo's, chips and feeding the little girl16 chicken tenders.17 MR. ARNOLD: That's a very, very18 important point. The one thing about the State19 Health Improvement Plan and you sort of reiterate20 this point is that the State Health Improvement21 Plan is -- I have a bit of a military background22 so when someone tells me a plan, it means I can23 put the key in and drive so we're operational24 wise. So although it's stated as a plan, it's aPage 101 1 framework and you have a mechanism now in order to 2 extend the community with the best practice model,3 those kinds of things, but the community4 engagement piece still has to be there to utilize5 those tracks. So a very, very astute observation.6 MS. GADON: Thank you. I've been in7 community health my whole life and it's wonderful8 that somebody is actually recognizing this is the9 way to go. 10 MS. ROBBINS: Good morning. Pamela11 Robbins, R-O-B-B-I-N-S, representing the Illinois12 Nurses Association. Thank you for allowing the13 Illinois Nurses Association to speak today.14 Professional nursing is a vital component to any15 healthcare system. Illinois has over 164,00016 licensed nurses to serve the public. As the17 soaring costs of healthcare increase, efforts to18 improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our19 Illinois healthcare system must take into account20 the nurses contribution to ensuring21 cost-effective, high-quality care. Numerous22 studies denote the impact of higher nursing23 staffing levels have on reduced hospital related24 mortality, hospital acquired pneumonia, mitigatingPage 102 1 complications by more rapid intervention to name a 2 few.3 In today's healthcare arena, we4 see increasing pressure to control costs. Patient5 volume and level of illness are still at an6 all-time high. There is a growing demand to7 improve safety and quality. Quality is important.8 The question becomes who is best to make it9 happen. Nurses already know they're a part of 10 that answer. Recent studies are documenting that11 from an economic standpoint, it is no longer12 acceptable to look at just the cost of nursing13 service, but rather the cost savings and value of14 quality patient outcomes that the nurse provides.15 In light of October's Institute16 of Medicines Report, healthcare reform is not just17 an idea. It must be made into an action plan.18 Such reform will take a departure from what is and19 move it to what it should be. Any plan will take20 cooperation of the state holders which will21 include a redesigning of the nursing workforce,22 reworking financial health initiatives, expansion23 of health insurance coverage, investing24 integration of health technology, changes inPage 103 1 education of nurses, consideration of the 2 workforce skill-mix and broadening the scope of3 practice to Illinois nurses in many profound ways.4 To truly reform healthcare from5 the historical model of treating illness in an6 episodic manner, we must move to a method of7 providing care across the studies of all providers8 allowing the public to fully recover from the9 illness or manage exacerbations of a chronic 10 illness. These methods would include emphasis on11 prevention, wellness programs, chronic illness12 management, home base primary care, nurse home13 visits, nurse managed health centers and community14 health teams.15 A study by Jencks, et al, from16 the New England Journal of Medicine reported that17 20 percent of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized18 between '03 and September '04 readmitted within 3019 days of discharge. The percentage increase went20 to 56 at one year. The cost of Medicare to21 taxpayers was estimated at over $17 billion. Mary22 Naylor has studied the use of advanced practice23 nurses, APN's, to coordinate and manage healthcare24 for hospitalized older adults with multiplePage 104 1 comorbidities and chronic illness. The APRN, 2 advance practice nurse, begins working with the3 patient upon admission to the hospital,4 coordinates care during hospitalization, makes5 home visits within the first 24 hours of discharge6 and, most importantly, continue to manage until7 the patient is stable and the caregivers are able8 to manage on their own.9 Naylor's transitional model has 10 reduced hospital readmission rates, improved11 patient's physical health, functional status and12 quality of life and reduced by about half the cost13 of patient's total healthcare costs.14 We must focus on how to close15 the gap on chronic illness. Nurses working in the16 community play a crucial role in healthcare17 promotion and disease prevention today. Various18 states have had programs sharing successful, care19 management strategies directed by nurses who were20 integral to a provider's practice who coordinate21 care and communication between patients and all22 members of the interdisciplinary team serving that23 patient and who directly provided healthcare24 services via in person, telephone or electronicPage 105 1 methods. 2 Increasing evidence is showing3 an enhanced, integral involvement of nurses in4 both the coordination and delivery of care5 particularly for patients and during multiple6 chronic illnesses and complex care regimes. Care7 management is critical to achieving the cost in8 quality targets. Several programs and initiatives9 include the health reform legislation involving 10 intra-disciplinary and cross-setting care11 coordination as well as care management services12 by RN's. I'm sure you're following my fundamental13 direction of care from costly acute hospital based14 care to prevention, wellness and chronic15 management delivery systems where the public lives16 and costs are diminished by keeping the public in17 a state of health.18 Many states have embraced19 changes in such deliveries of care. The question20 is when will Illinois. As state holders,21 policymakers, funders, educators, practitioners,22 we must look beyond the medical model as the sole23 solution to community health and recognize the24 contribution nursing and nurse practitioners arePage 106 1 making to primary care and health. Thank you for 2 allowing me to speak to the panel.3 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much.4 Very insightful and very well said. One of the5 questions -- you had mentioned -- you were6 mentioning a couple of issues that I was really7 interested. One is the view of what is the person8 of the future. I have gone through this before9 with the school of public health. What is the 10 public health work of the future? What do they11 look like? So what do you envision the person of12 future for nursing to look like and how do you13 coordinate things between different institutions14 where nurses are practicing a myriad of different15 settings? Is there a way of connecting that?16 MS. GIBBONS: I think the first17 thing one in every 48 adults in Illinois is a18 nurse. There are nurses that volunteer in19 parishes, at schools, in all sorts of communities.20 I would love to have a study of how nurses'21 families are managed with their care to keep them22 out of hospitals and take care of them on a23 wellness path and then disadvantage to those that24 don't have that nurse to manage.Page 107 1 You have to educate. Being in 2 the schools is vital. That is a community. That3 is where nurses need to be to coordinate4 healthcare for these children. I'm married to a5 farmer who is in a family farming operation. His6 90 year-old mother and father still full-time7 farm. They are healthy, they are engaged, and8 they also have managed care by a nurse.9 I really think that you've got 10 to educate the young. You've got to allow for11 access and I think advanced practice nursing and12 disallowing those barriers that we face today to13 be able to get the care to the community whether14 it's the school or the home because it's15 essentially -- nurses were public health nurses.16 They went out. School nurses were established to17 keep sick kids out of school, out of the community18 to keep the community well.19 The public nurse went in and20 took care of a brand new baby, made sure the21 mother knew about how to feed, how to care for22 that infant. Education is important. When you23 prevent the problem, it's much more cost-effective24 than waiting for them to come to you to thePage 108 1 hospital where you have as one doctor called it 2 expensive care than intensive care. And location,3 location, location.4 We've got to go out to the5 communities. I've heard this wonderful group of6 people who know how important it is. My7 community, my family community, my church8 community, the school community, how do you keep9 people from going episodically to the doctor when 10 they are so sick and they have gangrene because11 they had untreated diabetes and we wind up cutting12 off a leg in the operating room. I'm a recovery13 nurse for the last 32 years. It is just much14 easier to take care of by preventing than to do15 episodic, putting the fire out. So that is why16 it's the education axis and location, location,17 location.18 MR. ARNOLD: And in the Naylor19 transitional model, do you have any cost benefit20 analyses on that or documents?21 MS. GIBBONS: Actually, the document22 study that has been done and they tried to23 introduce federal legislation so I can get that24 information to you.Page 109 1 MR. ARNOLD: Great. Thank you. 2 MS. GIBBONS: Thank you.3 MS. NAUSS: Good morning. My name4 is Mary Rose, M-A-R-Y, R-O-S-E, N-A-U-S-S, and I5 represent the National Kidney Foundation. I am a6 volunteer. I'm under the supervision of Kate7 O'Connor and Marla Solomon. I am here today8 impromptu to -- so much has been said that I would9 love to echo all of it, but as a volunteer I want 10 to say it's not unique to what people say, but as11 far as I am concerned I represent courage, faith12 and enthusiasm. I'm part of Advocacy Day where13 people meet at the kidney foundation and we go to14 Springfield on a bus. We're educated on what to15 say to the legislators and how to say it and do16 like the three minute elevator speech type of17 thing with them to let them know how important it18 is for prevention with diabetes kidney disease.19 Something many of you are probably familiar with20 is the Kidney Mobile, which is once you've looked21 at how much salt is in a rib, it will probably be22 spoiled for you and that kind of thing.23 I have experienced somebody who24 I love dearly and been with for 15 yearsPage 110 1 experience a kidney transplant and that's what 2 inspired me to become involved with this group.3 Seeing what he went through with dialysis and all4 that and it was because of that kidney disease,5 but just to have someone give so much love to6 donate an organ and have him be able to live a7 normal, happy life. With all the challenges that8 go along with a transplant, I felt it in my heart9 to go out there and work with them. I have 10 probably lots more things to say, but --11 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you for your12 participation today. One of the things that13 underlies a lot of the programs that we speak of14 now and also has been part of President Obama's15 push from the beginning is volunteerism. We know16 he started in that track before becoming the17 president. So that is really a central focal18 point that we have to keep in mind that19 volunteers -- you know, volunteerism is a way that20 I learned when I was in high school.21 You know, I donated 2,000 hours22 to hospitalized patients just at the school23 running in and running home and that was over a24 four year period, but I got a lot more out of whatPage 111 1 I gave than what, you know, what I actually put in 2 I think. So thank you for your time and putting3 that on the record, but volunteers should be noted4 as being a central component and extremely5 important in this process. Thank you.6 MR. AFRICK: If I could just add a7 comment. You have a wonderful leader in Kate8 O'Connor and I think it really does underscore9 that as we're looking at all of the influencers on 10 chronic disease, there is a role for11 nongovernmental organizations to interact with the12 patient communities.13 MR. PATTERSON: Good morning. My14 name is Bill Patterson. I'd like to speak to15 martial arts programs as agents for chronic16 disease prevention and health promotion. I17 represent K.S. Hyun's Hapkido Schools in Chicago18 and with me is Dr. Shorty Mills representing 319 Cities Pagoda Martial Arts Schools in Hazel Crest.20 I'll present an abbreviated version of the21 testimony and an expanded version I've provided to22 the staff. I'd like to thank the Task Force for23 this opportunity to express our concerns for the24 public health of our communities and recommend thePage 112 1 utilization of community martial arts program as 2 agents for chronic disease prevention and health3 promotion.4 During this time, I'd like to5 establish a context with a brief overview of6 chronic diseases and existing guidance to deliver7 chronic disease prevention and health promotion8 and then describe the use of martial arts programs9 as agents of chronic disease prevention and health 10 promotion. I've provided a program logic model as11 a handout for the Task Force and it does12 correspond with this written report. Obesity and13 violence have become major public health concerns14 both national and local community educations.15 While the two concerns may appear to be unrelated,16 they both pose a major negative impact on the17 present future health of the population and the18 safety of our country.19 In January 2010, the surgeon20 general issued a report that identified obesity as21 a national epidemic draining billions of dollars22 from our economy. Further, two-thirds of the US23 adults and nearly one-third -- one in three24 children are overweight or obese. Conditions thatPage 113 1 increases their risk of diabetes, heart disease 2 and other chronic diseases. Obesity has become a3 national security concern. Over 9 million young4 adults, 27 percent of all Americans age 17 to 245 weigh too much to join the military according to6 Mission Readiness, a nonprofit organization7 promoting health and education.8 The group of young adults is9 also a source in which we draw our emergency 10 responders, police, firefighters and paramedics.11 The health of this population decreases, the12 defense of our country and its ability to respond13 in time of crisis during a national emergency is14 also diminished. The Justice Department study in15 October 2009 found that more than 60 percent of16 children surveyed were directly or indirectly17 exposed to violence in the last year. Victims of18 robbery, vandalism, theft or sexual assault.19 Nearly half the children or adolescents were20 assaulted at least once and more than one in ten21 were injured as a result, nearly one quarter of22 victims of robbery vandalism or theft.23 Project Oneness is a IDPH24 initiative for a more comprehensive approach toPage 114 1 community health specifically targeting health 2 risk behaviors that are leading causes of obesity,3 diabetes and various chronic diseases including4 violence. Unaddressed, these behaviors will5 result in increased death, disability,6 hospitalizations and illness among young people7 and adults in the United States. Communities8 experiencing high levels of these behaviors are9 identified as, quote, environmentally at risk, end 10 quote. In a concept paper, IDPH martial arts11 initiative dated 15 November 2007 the director of12 IDPH proposed utilizing existing martial arts13 academies to deliver positive health interventions14 and in environmentally at-risk communities.15 Further, that martial arts16 schools share similar objectives of public health17 and are to provide health education and promote18 safe environment where individuals can obtain19 their best possible state of physical and mental20 health and spiritual well-being; body, mind and21 spirit.22 It's estimated there are over23 200 martial arts programs in the Cook County area,24 approximately 800 to 900 throughout the state ofPage 115 1 Illinois. These include independent schools or 2 programs located within park districts, community3 youth serving organizations such as Boys and Girls4 Clubs, YMCA's, YWCA's, churches, et cetera. These5 programs are able to provide youths between the6 ages of 6 and 17 with professional martial arts7 instruction from established community martial8 arts schools.9 The program of traditional 10 martial arts instruction is a holistic approach to11 improving public health by emphasizing physical12 health and safety, mental health, education,13 positive care to development and good citizenship.14 Beginning in January 2008, Dr. Mills and I began a15 collaborative effort with the IDPH staff to design16 and implement a demonstration project for the17 martial arts programs to deliver public health18 interventions in the community. The program is19 entitled Youth Martial Arts for Total Health, the20 M.A.T.H. Project. The project, while still a work21 in progress, has integrated the expanded public22 health education into the martial arts curriculum.23 A major effort has been in the development of an24 evaluation design that records and tracks thePage 116 1 progress of students. 2 Currently, there are four3 martial arts schools that are participating in the4 project and collaborating on the -- collecting5 performance data that is forwarded to IDPH for6 analysis.7 The program logic that I'm going8 to provide to the Task Force provides and9 identifies the basic framework for the evaluation 10 of this particular project. It illustrates the11 relationships and the activities to the results or12 outcomes of the martial arts training. The basic13 components of the model are inputs, outputs and14 outcomes that measure initial, immediate and15 long-term impacts.16 The quantitative data may be17 derived from attendance, fitness testing,18 promotional records, school report cards for19 academic progress, behaviors, attendance and20 police reports. Once again, I would like to thank21 the Task Force for this opportunity to express our22 concerns for the public health of our communities23 and recommend the utilization of community martial24 arts programs as agents for chronic diseasePage 117 1 prevention and health promotions. We strongly 2 believe that the need is urgent for our state to3 address chronic disease prevention health4 promotion specifically targeting obesity and youth5 violence. Every resource we can identify must be6 used. Community based martial arts programs share7 the goals of the Department of Public Health and8 are uniquely equipped to deliver positive public9 health interventions. 10 Dr. Mills and I would like to11 take what time is left to answer any questions12 that the Task Force might have. Thank you.13 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much. I14 have martial arts experience in my background over15 the years, but I would never challenge these two.16 That would be my demise. The two of them have17 been working with this project and the one thing I18 say from this is that many projects are out there19 where you have these sports endeavors people can20 participate in such as volleyball, football,21 basketball, but many times -- and even baseball.22 They're looking for the star athlete and everyone23 else sits on the bench. So many of our programs24 that are actually being instituted across thePage 118 1 state are very, very slanted towards the higher 2 achiever, the person who is going to be on CNN3 accepting the Heisman trophy, but this program4 actually focuses on each individual student. It5 talks about nutrition, cardiovascular fitness,6 anti-drugs, anti-alcohol, anti -- it's really7 across the board. Self-esteem building, focus in8 school. It has many of the components that we9 talk about within public health which really 10 attracts me to it. There are basically ten11 components that I thought were very, very strong12 within these programs.13 So this is really a pilot14 program that has been underway and we're looking15 at the potential for the integration of the16 principals within the school system as well. Both17 have a law enforcement background and a military18 background as well and surely you can stand up,19 Dr. Mills. And as you can see, he's not really20 short. So if you ever see his name on a platform21 and you're supposed to be sparring with him, back22 off, but I will leave it open to the panel if23 anyone has any questions about what they're doing24 and how this is influencing children's lives. IPage 119 1 have all kinds of letters from parents. Just 2 remarkable instructors, the teachers, the schools3 they're seeing transformations in these children.4 It's always my belief that if you give a child --5 if you have a child under your auspices that6 you're taking care of, you can make a Hitler out7 of them or an Einstein. It depends on how you8 treat them and this is actually training them how9 to respect themselves, especially for young women 10 as well, making sure they focus and develop their11 self-esteem component, but, with that, I'm going12 to leave it open. Any questions or -- okay. Very13 good. Thank you very much for your testimony.14 MR. PATTERSON: Thank you very much.15 MS. VAVIGLUS: Good morning, ladies16 and gentlemen. My name is Martha Vaviglus,17 V-A-V-I-G-L-U-S. I am a professor of preventive18 medicine and medicine at Northwestern University19 Feinberg Medical School. Well, this is the first20 public hearing I attended. So you have to bear21 with me because I didn't know what is a public22 hearing at this state level. I have been invited23 years ago to the White House to give a public24 hearing on health cause, but it was different.Page 120 1 What they wanted me to talk about in public was 2 exactly what I knew as a scientist as a3 researcher. Also, I wanted to tell you that I am4 the principal investigator of the Hispanic5 community health study, study of Latinos. It's6 the longest study to date on the conditions that7 effect several ethnic groups of the Latino8 population because when we think about Latino we9 believe that they are all Mexicans and maybe they 10 are different -- different between of all these11 ethnic groups in the Hispanic community.12 Therefore, we are collecting13 data on 16,000 individuals ages 18 through 74 with14 the purpose of seeing the true prevalence of15 conditions and this is including diabetes because,16 among Latino's, obesity and diabetes has the17 highest prevalence compared to African-Americans18 and whites. So you have -- this gave us an idea19 of perhaps seeing so much diabetes among this20 population it would be important -- I think I just21 wanted to say before saying that what we are going22 to learn from this historical study among Latinos23 we can apply to other bases. It can go to other24 communities, of course. So having a registry ofPage 121 1 diabetes in the state of Illinois, we believe it's 2 timely not only because we want it to count how3 many number of people with diabetes we are going4 to have in the state of Illinois or what are the5 best practices and treatments that work better6 than the others, but also this register has to7 have a public health service program for8 prevention because we already know that these9 people are going to go to hospitals where 10 admissions -- and I just wanted to say as a note11 40 percent of admissions to the hospital has a12 diagnosis -- underlying diagnosis of diabetes.13 So to prevent those admissions14 and to prevent the awful consequences of15 diabetes -- because I don't have to tell you. We16 all know what happens with obesity and what17 happens with obesity and ask a cardiovascular18 person and with my background I can tell you19 prevention of diabetes is important, but now we20 are talking about secondary prevention where we21 cardiologists believe that diabetes is equal to22 myocardial infarction. So that is how terrible23 this disease is.24 So we would like with thisPage 122 1 registry of diabetes, having the service of public 2 health, help diabetic patients to, perhaps, eat3 better and exercise more and quit smoking and the4 emphasis as I mentioned previously should be5 always on the less educated, the low income, the6 people who have English as a second language7 because maybe they go to see physicians, maybe8 they are -- they know that they have to be9 treated, but, unfortunately, they cannot go to do 10 it or they cannot register on the Internet. They11 don't know how they are going to register on this12 wonderful program of exercise, nutrition that we13 are talking about.14 So efforts on these great15 organizations that aren't doing such an important16 work it is imperative. We would like to continue17 and, of course, talking about probably hundreds18 and millions of dollars that we never have for19 health, however, this is going to prevent a cost20 in the future because if we are letting the21 population grow frail, we are not only making a22 disservice to the people why people would like to23 live longer with this awful condition.24 So we would then like -- becausePage 123 1 it is important for us, for Northwestern 2 University, to help in this program. For example,3 Northwestern was very involved in the control4 of diabetes, in the control of hypertension and5 work together with the state and with the6 national. So I do believe that this is an7 important problem registry that the state of8 Illinois should consider because it is timely due9 to the accessibility of medical records. Thank 10 you very much.11 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much,12 Doctor. I can see your passion coming through as13 well. That's very, very good, but registry is14 definitely a concept that we have been15 entertaining because actually part of this diagram16 which I have not gone into because actually it17 will be rolling out, we're developing pieces of18 it, but the idea of a community based kiosk model19 is already developed, but also the fusion center20 concept about using public health information and21 having data being more accessible to people on a22 general basis, on a statewide basis, but that most23 definitely is really one of the things that we are24 really seriously considering the issues of soPage 124 1 thank you for bringing it to the forefront and 2 thank you for your passion and it looks like --3 MR. AL-NURIDDIN: Good afternoon.4 Consortium of Illinois and the Roseland Community8 Hospital. I'm wearing both hats this morning.9 First of all, I really am glad to be here in front 10 of this Task Force and really I'm glad mainly11 because all my advocacy friends have been here12 this morning so I don't have to say everything13 that they said, but I will say something to them14 with this opportunity.15 Advocacy has to get focused on16 one or two things that we can all get done because17 if we don't do that we're going to keep on for the18 last fours -- we keep missing everything because19 we can't get together on a couple of things and I20 really hope we can find that and hopefully that's21 another discussion.22 Meanwhile, we have the23 Department of Public Health and its leader here24 and I want to, first of all, frame this lastPage 125 1 little comments on one, the need for leadership 2 and vision in government. Since the election is3 over and we look like we have four more years of4 Governor Quinn, I want to know if you're going to5 stay for four years because if you're not, then we6 need to know about the consistency of the7 leadership. Fortunately with Dr. Whitaker8 leaving, you came in and took over and even gave9 us a whole sense of breath as we talked about this 10 whole sense of public health and understand what11 public health is and the importance of it. I12 ain't laughing because to me this is serious.13 I know my friends in advocacy14 understand this and maybe don't want to talk about15 it, but we got no money in the state. So we got16 no money. We need to be certain about leadership17 and because we don't have any money we better18 focus on things that don't cost no money because19 there is no guarantee no money is going to show up20 unless somebody has some to put in the state's21 coffers and it ain't me.22 What I see is we're going to23 look at losing programs and losing things and I'm24 not going to spend time trying to argue thePage 126 1 financial benefit of prevention. That's a waste 2 of time. That's already been done. The question3 is does anybody got the courage enough to start4 reforming the system.5 We have a great healthcare6 reform platform in law. We have a Healthcare7 Reform Implementation Task Force and Committee.8 Where is the plan for implementation? If9 prevention doesn't give the incentives, then it 10 ain't going to happen. If it ain't dollars on the11 front end for prevention, then we going to keep on12 having this conversation because nobody is ready13 to give up feeding their families in order to do14 the right thing. That takes too much courage and15 there ain't that much courage out here unless16 somebody knows something I don't know and I'm17 willing to listen.18 We need to be able to as19 advocates impact the governor and our legislators20 around policy issues that we think someone needs21 to say raise the water so all boats have an22 opportunity to rise. I'm so sick of the disease23 of the month, the flavor of the month. I can't24 get enough attention on one disease. My wife is aPage 127 1 diabetic. My mother and my father are diabetics. 2 They want to know how come everybody talks about3 cancer and nobody talks about diabetes. Well, we4 talk about diabetes now. We got about 15 more5 days before we have to talk about something else.6 A month before that it was sickle cell. So what7 is it? Disease of the month, every flavor you can8 get and it keeps on competing over the same issue9 where everybody is dying because of what they 10 eating or what they ain't doing.11 So when we get to this whole12 issue, what are the whole issues and they've been13 spoken of already before so I don't need to go14 over there, but what I'd like to talk about is15 this. One, please stop letting the folks take16 money out of outreach and public education and17 calling itself doing something. The Department of18 Family Health Services, the Department of Public19 Health, it's hard and harder to get a dollar to20 get people who can go and knock on doors and do21 this peer kind of education and information. If22 you don't have that, you are putting planes in the23 air, you are putting missiles in the air, but you24 ain't got no troops on the ground to fight thisPage 128 1 war for poor health. We have to have boots on the 2 ground. There's a lot of Democrats almost lost3 the dog gone election in Illinois. No troops on4 the ground. You all get that. Somebody better5 know something.6 All right. Community health7 workers -- this whole healthcare reform there is8 more need than their capacity. I love my nurses.9 Some of them are gone already. There's a shortage 10 of nurses. There's a shortage of doctors.11 There's a shortage of technicians. There's a12 shortage in every profession. So what the heck13 are we sitting here talking about putting together14 programs when we ain't got nobody to do them. We15 need to talk about how we're going to clear the16 pipeline. Two things I hope we do. One, address17 the issue of certification for community health18 workers. That doesn't take a fight. Everybody19 seems to be in agreement. So why don't we just20 get some certification, get the public education21 system to start doing the training so we can put22 people out in the public education doing patient23 advocacy, doing system navigation and doing all24 the things that community health workers are doingPage 129 1 from dealing with the whole issue of food deserts 2 to everything else.3 You tell me my time is up so let4 me finish with this. We need to focus on the5 strategies to increase -- this is one of the areas6 where I think everybody can get a rise. I would7 like to see the Department of Public Health and8 the State Board of Education come up with a Task9 Force to work on these pipeline opportunities the 10 healthcare reform provides and let's get people on11 the bottom rung for healthcare workers and let's12 talk about getting the pediments out of the dog13 gone nursing program where they trying to tell my14 daughter she is going to get an online nursing15 program and I know damn well you can't because you16 ain't got enough nurses to do the training and17 every school got backup lines that is three years18 long. So let's get the mess. Either let's talk a19 way to get something other than master's degree20 level nurses or let's take it on computer lines21 that supposed to be able to get more advantage of22 the nurses that are available, but otherwise than23 that I really know we just don't want to make this24 a wasted day and a wasted night and I know youPage 130 1 guys are going to do a lot of good, hard work, and 2 I hope we can get to a few of these policy issues3 that don't cost no money, but I think we're ready4 for a little fight. If you say so, we'll be down5 there with the buses.6 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you. One of the7 things that is really important to what he was8 saying is -- that was an interesting point is,9 one, that when we start talking about the issue of 10 the Patient Protection Act, Title 4 is for11 wellness and prevention and I believe it's12 somewhere in the area of $150 billion that they're13 talking about putting into that. Title 5 is14 workforce development, but as one of the things15 that many of my deputy directors go through when16 they walk up to me and ask for different money and17 more staff and I always give them the analogy I18 have a thousands pieces of a car in front of my19 house and I want to join the Indy 500 in a couple20 of months and all these pieces are scattered all21 over the lawn.22 So they come forward -- and I23 don't have the lawn in reality. So all these24 pieces are in front of my house and I ask them toPage 131 1 bring in gasoline. I say \"Why don't you bring a 2 hundred gallons or a thousand gallons of gasoline3 and pour it on top of the parts\" and he looks at4 me like what are you talking about? And then I5 say \"Why don't you bring in some strobe lights and6 metrics so we can measure how fast this thing is7 going and flags\" and it's like what are you8 talking about? That's crazy. You have parts all9 over the ground. Then I say \"Why are you asking 10 me for more staff and more money when you don't11 have a plan?\" You don't have something12 functional. You don't have something put13 together.\"14 And that, you know, really15 astounded me about two months ago. I realized16 that Ray Batra and the -- for the CDC's position17 and for HHS when they came forward and said you18 have seven days to bring me a plan in order to get19 funded and then 14 days is the maximum and I'm20 looking at it like how can you get something21 together in that period of time and the point is22 that you should already have it together. They're23 looking for projects where people have been24 thinking over time and putting something togetherPage 132 1 that makes sense and they don't want people 2 throwing things together in the last seven days3 and saying \"Here. Take this.\"4 So the planning and the5 development stage is something you don't need6 money for. All you need is a cup of coffee or a7 cup of tea, sit down and plan and make sure that8 this thing is making sense and once you implement9 this model that it is actually going to have some 10 metrics in place and makes sense once it's11 implemented, but until this point we're just12 spinning our wheels and throwing gasoline on13 broken parts.14 So that's really why it's15 important to really focus and to make sure that16 we're looking at best practice models and17 developing the right mechanisms. Next.18 MR. WILLIAMSON: Good afternoon. My19 name is Eli H. Williamson, E-L-I, Williamson,20 W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S-O-N. All right. Today, I'm here21 representing an organization I cofounded. I'm a22 veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan, had the23 pleasure of serving with Dr. Arnold in Iraq in24 2004.Page 133 1 I cofounded an organization 2 called Leave No Veteran Behind. Leave No Veteran3 Behind was cofounded by two veterans of Iraq and4 Afghanistan to provide educational and employment5 opportunities to veterans and they return to6 civilian life. These two pillars of our7 organization, education and employment constitute8 the backbone of any successful veteran integration9 and support services. Our unique programing seeks 10 to provide innovated strategies that create11 synergy between government agencies, industry,12 veteran support service providers and the13 community at large.14 The first component of our15 services provide educational debt relief to16 veterans who are facing economic hardship, are not17 covered by existing educational programs and have18 completed some form of higher education. This19 retroactive scholarship relieves veterans by20 applying privately donated money to the veteran's21 student loan account. Once the veteran's22 educational debt has been paid in full, the23 veteran is required to give back by performing 10024 hours of community service. Since our program hasPage 134 1 been founded, we have paid off the student loans 2 of four veterans and these veterans have already3 completed over 400 hours of community service.4 While the primary mission is to5 keep the promise of equal access to educational6 benefits to all of our veterans, the secondary7 focus of our program is the benefit of8 volunteerism on veteran integration. The veterans9 of this program are highly motivated and have a 10 successful demographic. They have all shown the11 drive to complete some form of higher education12 and, of course, serve in the United States13 military. Coincidentally, 98 percent of the14 veterans who are enrolled in our educational debt15 relief program are already performing some form of16 community service. The other two percent would be17 if they weren't inundated with educational debt.18 PTSD and other mental health19 related problems routinely keep veterans from20 attending and/or finishing school. We hypothesize21 that community service and engagement is another22 key component to help veterans readjust to23 civilian society. We hope to use the data from24 our program to ascertain the positive effects ofPage 135 1 volunteerism and veterans integration. We are 2 also looking for an established mental health3 medical partner to work with our organization to4 research potential mental health opportunities5 that community service provides.6 The second component provides7 workforce development and employment services to8 over 50 personnel on the south side of Chicago.9 Our innovative program provides transitional jobs 10 to veterans who are unemployed or underemployed.11 Leave No Veteran Behind was one of the community12 organizations that was awarded a contract with the13 Chicago Public Schools for Safe Passage. Our14 veterans provide Safe Passage to Chicago public15 school students as they walk to and from school16 for this school year.17 Veterans hired by this program18 get paid $10 an hour, six hours a day every school19 day for the school year. We currently serve the20 Hyde Park, Wood Lawn and Bronzeville areas. These21 services reach over 3,000 students every day.22 This contract was an extension of our community23 service initiative that was started by one of our24 veterans who has helped with our educational debtPage 136 1 relief program. His name was Haki Gurkin. He is 2 also a Chicago police officer, served ten years in3 the United States Navy in military intelligence4 personnel and he is also a ten year veteran of the5 Chicago Police Department. He was integral in6 creating our strategies for Safe Passage.7 Ingrained in this transitional employment8 opportunity are multiple opportunities that9 facilitate our primary goal, transitioning 10 veterans into long-term, sustainable employment.11 All employed veterans receive 20 hours of free12 unarmed security training, which allows them to13 get their PERC card. This card will allow them to14 work security or work security related jobs15 anywhere in the state of Illinois.16 Our organization did not seek to17 pigeon hold any veteran to a specific field, but18 this qualification fits the training regime that19 all our veterans received in the military and20 provides a solid, fallback opportunity if their21 other plans are not successful. Veterans are also22 provided with our youth engagement training that23 is specifically designed for the Safe Passage24 contract. This training focuses on violencePage 137 1 mitigation techniques, positive adult interaction 2 and governments who use service referrals. Our3 holistic approach to mitigating youth violence has4 literally saved the lives of at-risk youths this5 year.6 Finally, we hope to provide7 first aid and CPR training to all of our veterans8 associated with our program. This training will9 not only be important if they see an old lady who 10 falls down getting on the bus or a kid who was11 attacked at school because of violence, but it's12 also important because they have this training in13 their own household as well.14 At every stage of our workforce15 development program, we put an emphasis on16 providing our veterans tangible skills, income and17 most importantly a connection to the community18 that they live. It is our hope to have employed19 and trained over 150 veterans by the end of the20 school year and have placed 100 of those veterans21 in long-term employment. We also hope to provide22 interested veterans exposure to opportunities for23 employment with at-risk youths. We feel that24 veterans offer at-risk youths several attributesPage 138 1 that will positively impact their lives. They 2 understand standards. They are taught mentorship3 and leadership. They know how to teach skills and4 tasks. They are our nation's heros. Leave No5 Veteran Behind has been servicing veterans for6 just over a year and a half. We have leveraged7 our education, business and knowledge of veteran's8 issues to provide the best services to our9 veterans and also within our community. We hope 10 to continue this success with your support.11 MR. ARNOLD: First of all, I want to12 applaud you for what you've done, but, you know,13 it's not just because I happen to be a veteran, an14 old one, so I hope it's old men, too, if they fall15 you help them as well, too.16 MR. WILLIAMSON: We have a Korean17 War veteran that is going to be signed onto our18 program next week. He is 80 years old.19 MR. ARNOLD: But the thing about the20 program that it really is helping people who are21 coming into -- back home from oversea's22 deployments. Many of them have challenges, you23 know, mental and physical, because of what they24 were exposed to and the reason why I joined thePage 139 1 service actually was because with the Vietnam 2 veterans the way they were being treated in3 hospital systems when I first was going through my4 training in medical school and it was deplorable5 and there were some circumstances that led me to6 within a week to go and sign up and to join the7 military. So it was for a six-month period. It8 turned out to be 26 years. The best thing I ever9 did in my life. So I applaud you for what you're 10 doing and I think this is an ingenious program.11 One of the bills that we actually helped to12 support and pass was this bill to extend the13 bridge between academic institutions and people14 who are returning from service who actually have15 some background and training in emergency response16 and paramedic training and EMT training.17 So that's in effect as well, but18 many community are without paramedics and EMT's so19 we sort of suggested that would be a great idea20 for the people who are returning to especially21 rural communications to be involved in this22 program so that they can actually get gainful23 employment and we can keep veterans off the24 street. They don't deserve to be there. So thankPage 140 1 you again, but any questions from anybody else on 2 the Task Force? Thank you.3 MS. LIU: Good afternoon. My name4 is Hong Liu, L-I-U, and I'm the executive director5 of the Midwest Asian Health Association, MAHA.6 First, I'd like to thank Dr. Arnold for inviting7 me to this hearing and this is very educational.8 Asians -- I'm here to testify a few key health9 issues in the Asian community and on behalf of the 10 Asian community. Asians are considered more of a11 minority, but we do share some of the health12 issues and the health concerns as other minority13 communities.14 Illinois is among the five15 states with the largest number of Asians.16 Approximately 79 percent of Asians are foreign17 born. In Cook County, 30 percent of Asian18 households are increasingly isolated indicating19 that no household member age 14 and over speaks20 English well. More than 26 percent of Asian21 households have an income less than $20,000 and 2022 percent of Asians do not have a regular source of23 healthcare.24 Since over 65 percent of allPage 141 1 Asian Americans are foreign born speaking over 100 2 different languages, access to healthcare in the3 Asian community is, therefore, not limited to4 socioeconomic status. Linguistic isolation, the5 lack of culturally appropriate care providers, low6 socioeconomic status and many other issues7 contribute into the great health disparities among8 Asian populations.9 For example, Asian Americans in 10 the US have the lowest cancer screening rates of11 all ethnic groups and are more likely to be12 diagnosed at a later stage in the cancer13 progression when cure is less likely and the14 treatment is less effective. Although it is rare15 in women living in Asia, within a few years of16 immigrating into the US, breast cancer in Asian17 women increased by 35 percent in Illinois. Among18 Vietnamese and Filipina women, cervical cancer19 rates are five times higher than for white women20 living in the US -- in Illinois.21 Hepatitis B and liver cancer22 rate is much, much higher in Asian population.23 Eight to 15 percent of Asians is Hepatitis B24 positive as opposed to one to two percent of thePage 142 1 general US population. According to our study, in 2 three Asian communities, diabetes is very high in3 the Asian population. You feel we eat healthy4 food, but for some reason diabetes is high, very5 high. Recent studies have uncovered an increasing6 prevalence of mental health among minority7 communities and among Asian population. According8 to the recent press release issued by the9 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 10 Administration, SAMHSA, one in six Chinese11 American young adults experience serious12 psychological distress in the past year. Despite13 the high prevalence among this group, only one in14 nine, 11.2 percent Asian American young adults15 with serious psychological distress received care16 within the past 12 months.17 Overall, the rates are seeking18 care for mental health among racial ethnic19 minority young adults are much lower than they are20 Caucasian counterparts. In addition, Asian21 American females have had the second highest rate22 of suicide in every age group in Illinois and23 there have been more than 160 suicides in the24 Asian American community in the past 15 years.Page 143 1 Also, the US Department of Health and Human 2 Services reported in 2005 Asian American women3 between the age of 15 and 24 had the highest4 number of suicides among all US women in that age5 group. Asian American children and adolescents6 are considered by mental health providers to be7 highly prone to depression. And even if mental8 health problems is prevalent in the Asian9 population, mental health programs targeting the 10 Asian population are scare.11 In the atmosphere in the12 Bridgeport community, which is most of the13 Chinatown area, 60 percent of residents are14 Asians, but there's no community based mental15 health intervention program targeting the issue.16 So I'm here -- I don't have much time so I'm here17 basically to advocate for a wellness and a program18 in the four key health areas for the Asian19 population which is low cancer screening rates,20 high rate of Hepatitis B and cervical cancer, high21 rate of diabetes and the fourth is the mental22 health prevalent issues.23 In summary, I believe we need24 resources, programs, to address those issues whichPage 144 1 have highly impacted our community. Thank you for 2 allowing me to have this opportunity to speak on3 behalf of the Asian communities.4 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you, Hong Liu.5 And for people that don't know you, she does a6 phenomenal job with the community outreach and7 providing services within her community and8 actually reaches beyond the community with many of9 the things that she does. And that's -- these 10 four priority areas we have talked about them11 previously and this Hepatitis B is something that12 is totally preventable through vaccination13 programs and with the issues that you brought up14 about mental health as well, you know, suicide is15 becoming a big issue among teens throughout the16 nation and we need to really start addressing many17 of the concerns that are surrounding that.18 I think these four areas of19 intervention really need to be looked at. Are20 there any -- I know there are some clinics that21 are in the area that you have been working with22 and developing, but what is the thing you feel is23 needed the most? Is it the community education or24 is it the actual access point or funding stream toPage 145 1 build a model? 2 MS. LIU: I think access issue is a3 big issue among the Asian community because of the4 language issue and there are some community based5 clinics surrounding the Chinatown area -- not6 right in the Chinatown area. So that's a problem7 in terms of access issue, lack of language8 assistance. If we have a community based clinic9 serving low income uninsured clients right in the 10 community, then the community can help with a lot11 of language assistance help.12 So it's hard to find an area --13 going out of this opportunity, but if you have a14 center there then we can provide free volunteer15 services to solve that language problem so the16 bilingual staff is right in the community, but if17 you go out then that becomes a challenge. So I'm18 trying to advocate for a community health center19 that provides comprehensive community services20 right in the Chinatown which has 60 percent of21 Asians which would reduce a lot of costs for22 providing language services and we can get23 mobilize communities to provide that, but the24 location is not there for us to provide thePage 146 1 health. 2 MR. MITCHELL: Dwayne Mitchell, CEO3 for East Chicago Community Health Center which is4 a federally funded 330 community health center in5 Indiana, but I'm also with Governors State6 University and I can give you help and guidance.7 Between now and December 10th, the federal8 government has initiated new access points and the9 new access point applications, about $650,000 for 10 new starts. I would encourage you and I can help11 you if you have a couple of community health12 centers in that area that would probably be in13 preparation to do this, a Mercy access and you14 also have the Near North Health Service15 Corporation which is right near in the Grand16 Boulevard community 47th and Greenwood.17 You can get my information after18 this meeting and I will put you in contact, but19 also the Illinois Primary Healthcare Association20 would be able to guide you with Bruce Johnson who21 is the president and CEO. So I think that you22 have a good opportunity to get federal dollars to23 actually bring access to care in that community24 and begin to look at some of the enabling servicesPage 147 1 that the state would be able to provide in terms 2 of prevention processes.3 MS. LIU: Wonderful. Thank you so4 much.5 MR. ARNOLD: And with the issue6 about -- it's sort of borderline on the issue of7 the cultural and linguistic competency. You know,8 one of the things that is a provision within the9 document and I asked them to make sure it was 10 explicitly stated is that we brought up the issue11 as one of the co-chairs of the SHIP document, but12 one of the things that was stated was there needs13 to be cultural and linguistic competency and I14 said \"There's one way to save money directly\" and15 they said \"What's that?\" And I said \"You have16 linguistic and cultural competency training, but17 you also have people within the community who are18 already linguistically and culturally competent19 that can be trained.\" So their needs to be20 brought forward, too, with the workforce21 development under Title 5 and with what Dwayne is22 saying about making sure that you gain access to23 resources that can actually support you. That24 actually is written as part of the SHIP documentPage 148 1 to make sure that people within the community have 2 ownership and some responsibility in the actual3 treatment care course and prevention course. So4 that's really a good platform for you.5 MS. LIU: Thank you so much.6 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you for your7 testimony. Any other documents or supporting8 documents that you would like to give us, please9 provide them to us and we will also make ourselves 10 available to anyone who needs that kind of11 assistance.12 MS. LIU: Thank you.13 MR. BONGNER: Gentleman, My name is Brian Bongner, last name15 B-O-N-G-N-E-R. I am actually with the Lake County16 Health Department and Community Health Center.17 Today, I'm actually here representing the Illinois18 Public Health Association and the AIDS Foundation19 of Chicago Service Providers Council, the topic20 I'm sure you're very familiar with already.21 As you are aware, we do have22 many medications right now that are used for the23 treatment of HIV. People are able to live a much24 healthier, longer life because of these lifePage 149 1 saving medications as long as they are able to 2 access the medications early during the diagnosis3 and are able to continue that without4 interruption. For those people that have HIV5 disease, it is becoming a chronic disease in our6 community. People are living longer, which is a7 wonderful thing, but we are also starting to see8 that longevity of life is creating some other9 obstacles that we now have to face. 10 Today, we look at what is11 happening in our community. We know that we have12 approximately 45,000 individuals in the state of13 Illinois that have been diagnosed with HIV.14 Unfortunately, we estimate that there's about15 another 10,000 that have not yet been diagnosed or16 are completely unaware of their diagnosis at this17 point. We've seen some estimates from the18 Department of Public Health that approximately19 seven to eight individuals are being diagnosed20 with HIV in Illinois everyday, 56 people every21 week, just slightly more than 3,000 people every22 year in this state are being diagnosed with HIV.23 The cost for HIV care just the medical components24 is approximately $350,000. We are going to spendPage 150 1 close to $1 billion this year on the total for 2 healthcare for people living with HIV. Staggering3 health disparities also exist within the realm of4 HIV and AIDS. A study conducted in Chicago found5 that HIV positive rates among African-American men6 identifying as men who have sex with men were as7 high as eight times that of the counterparts of8 white men in the same area. We also have found9 that the same disparity exists within the Latino 10 population. Latinos have a higher prevalence or11 three times higher rate of incidents compared to12 their white counterparts in that same area.13 We are asking that the Chronic14 Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Task Force15 take into consideration three things as you're16 moving forward with your process. First is to17 prioritize the core of public health functions. A18 strong, skilled and adequately resourced public19 health sector is instrumental for the state's20 efforts to continue to prevent chronic disease and21 promote health. However, local health departments22 have been challenged, crippled and even put out of23 business because of some of the funding cuts that24 we have, some of the reduction in services andPage 151 1 some of the efforts that have continued to put the 2 agencies under the gun.3 Public health departments are4 the first responders in the fight against chronic5 disease, but cannot respond adequately if the6 resources are not there. To use the first7 responder analogy, you have an ambulance that has8 very bad tires. You have just barely enough9 medical supplies to prepare for the patient and 10 enough gas to get the ambulance to that patient,11 but you don't have the gas to get them to the12 hospital. Much like your scenario, Dr. Arnold.13 We are also looking at what this14 Commission can do is be able to sustain the local15 health protection grants that are able to be used16 in local communities. Secondly, we are asking17 that you look at the opportunity to implement a18 Section 1115 Medicaid waiver. The many provisions19 of the healthcare reform will not begin until20 2014. Illinois will spend close to $20 million21 this year alone on the AIDS drug assistance22 program and although the federal red and white23 funds will meet some of the basic healthcare needs24 of people living with HIV in our community,Page 152 1 current funding is insufficient to address a more 2 complex condition which are directly related to3 HIV infection, including bone density loss,4 cancers, renal disease and the list goes on.5 Illinois could gain a lot of --6 keeping millions of dollars or even more from7 federal Medicaid funding by implementing the 11158 Medicaid waiver to expand Medicare coverage to9 people with HIV who are not currently eligible. 10 We expect the federal government to soon release a11 template to state that they wish to adopt the12 Medicare waiver and expand that HIV care as well.13 The last point I'd like to bring14 forward to this Commission is the opportunity to15 stress and work with the Department of Public16 Health to reassess all Illinois HIV prevention17 activities. The state has a massive budget18 deficit. To reduce future spending on HIV medical19 care, Illinois must ensure that every dollar spent20 on HIV prevention programming is getting the21 maximum return. In the era of fiscal disparity,22 we must get more prevention services out of every23 dollar that we spend. We urge the state to ensure24 that every dollar spent goes to prevention andPage 153 1 testing of the population at greatest risk and is 2 spent on the activities that will yield the3 greatest benefit to our state.4 Gentlemen, all of our goals is5 very simple. We want to reduce the number of new6 infections of HIV in the state every year until we7 are no longer seeing infections happen. This is8 achieved through prevention efforts. This is one9 area we really must focus on. Maintaining the 10 funding to be able to do that is important, but11 keeping in mind these three core elements are also12 things that we'd like you to take into13 consideration. I'll offer any opportunity for14 questions.15 MR. ARNOLD: Okay. A couple of16 comments embedded in all of the things that you17 said which are really some great points to be made18 that can actually be a benefit to the state, the19 Section 1115 we'll look at as well. I know my20 staff is already starting to --21 MR. BONGNER: I've been working with22 Dr. Williams on that.23 MR. ARNOLD: But also that, you24 know, HIV now has led to development of AIDS. OfPage 154 1 course, back in the 1980s is when we first 2 encountered those things, but people are living a3 much longer life now and one of the things we have4 to get away from is looking at diseases and saying5 that once you have a diagnosis that's the only6 diagnosis you're going to ever get. So we become7 labeled as that thing. So you're a diabetic or8 you're hypertensive so you're put into this9 category and it seems as though you have a shield 10 around you that you can't get anything else, but11 with living a longer life you are still going to12 be running towards the same kinds of things, colon13 cancer, heart disease, those same kinds of things14 and we have to keep a focal point on that as well15 because the overall health of a person is very,16 very important.17 I'm glad you brought that up and18 it needs to really be recognized as a chronic19 disease in full and also on the idea that there20 are other coexisting conditions that need to be21 addressed as well for medical coverage, but thank22 you very much for your presentation and thank you23 for your documentation and your work in the field24 and a great organization.Page 155 1 MR. BONGNER: Thank you, gentlemen. 2 MR. ARNOLD: We're getting close. I3 know we're going overtime by about ten minutes4 after 1:00 right now and I've been on many task5 forces in the past -- they've gone usually two6 hours in the past. So we're not going too badly,7 but I'm trying to make sure that we're respectful8 of people.9 MS. SCIAMMARELLA: Good afternoon. 10 Thank you, Doctor, for this opportunity to testify11 for the concerns that we have in our community.12 MR. ARNOLD: State your name,13 please.14 MS. SCIAMMARELLA: I'm sorry. My15 name is Esther Sciammarella. I spell it for you.16 S-C-I-A-M-M-A-R-E-L-L-A. The Chicago Hispanic17 Health Coalition is who I represent and I'm the18 director. The Chicago Hispanic Health Coalition19 has been having meetings since 2005 not only with20 agencies in the community, with hospital agencies21 in different institutions, with the state, with22 the city of Chicago, with Cook County and with23 this group we have made a list -- has been making24 recommendations and what I'm planning to do todayPage 156 1 is list to you the different recommendations that 2 provide to the Chicago Hispanic Health Coalition3 for improving diabetes -- I mean, in general, I4 think I would be specific in diabetes, but this5 could be with chronic disease. I want to6 acknowledge you on the effort. We work together7 in the Task Force to promote with the state's --8 the current Task Force and I see the effort that9 has been done so one thing I want to emphasize is 10 the importance to have a registry. We know that11 currently Minnesota and all different states has12 been very strong and I think it's time and it's13 important that Illinois have a registry condition.14 I think if we talking to each other knowing that15 many people are doing things and we need to have a16 directory of service and programs, websites in the17 community to the activities and address diabetes18 and other health conditions as well, collection of19 the best practice on diabetes healthcare. I think20 the coalition did an inventory of the different21 providers in the city of Chicago and I want to go22 back a little bit about my history of being in the23 health department for 19 -- to 2006, I believe.24 That we need to know who is doing what. Not onlyPage 157 1 for us providers, but for the consumers and be 2 sure that we know who is doing what. We need to3 have good problems in diabetes because it's very4 comprehensive. It's necessary to -- like an5 experience in breast cancer, we need to do this6 same thing with diabetes so people know where to7 go and where to get good service and for Illinois8 communities we need good programs. We need9 assistance in order to change disparity. I 10 challenge myself in other communities that the11 disparaging continue and we need to figure out why12 we are not succeeding and improving the condition13 of the minority community.14 So we need to -- really bring15 best practice on diabetes that are culturally16 appropriate, increased health fairs effectiveness17 and I want to mention what Mr. Salim was18 mentioning about the community health workers.19 Health Department, Incorporated and the community20 health workers in 1990, we funding different21 communities now, Chinese community, Asian22 communities, the Hispanic community, I can name23 Korea, but we need funding to navigate patients to24 the services they need. We need to have communityPage 158 1 health workers. We are trying to work on funding, 2 the navigator to connect everything and we don't3 have that. Money comes into organization to pay4 for health promoters, but it's not code to be5 implemented and you're competing with no nurse and6 no doctor. So not just statewide -- and we need7 to work with the Cook County Department of Public8 Health, we need to work with the city and I think9 with -- I mean, different organizations who are 10 going to improve hospital discharge planning.11 I mean, we need to work with the12 emergency room. Many people have mentioned that13 people go to the emergency room. They are not14 planning to discharge and we need to have15 continuation of care. I think that example way16 back to mental health is when we discharge people17 from nursing home, we need to have a way to18 connect those people with services. So -- and I19 think we need to make diabetes an important thing.20 Thank you very much for your time.21 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much22 because I know that you have done a lot in that23 field in bringing together a big group with the24 support for the diabetes registry so I think it'sPage 159 1 an excellent idea that we need to move towards the 2 establishment and we can start looking at that.3 If you have any particular models that you are4 looking -- you mentioned Minnesota and --5 MS. SCIAMMARELLA: I think currently6 Minnesota I have -- I don't know if it's the Mayo7 Clinic or what, but they have good, modern -- I8 think the governor mentioned that the Department9 of Public Health is working with the family 10 service so there is money there. I think this is11 the opportunity. When I start, nobody want to12 touch the issue of registry because there is no13 money to implement the system, but now with the14 medical record I think it's the opportunity to use15 and I think the Department of Family Service --16 no. I think it's family service?17 MR. ARNOLD: No. That's why I think18 it's so fundamentally important for --19 MS. SCIAMMARELLA: So it's a matter20 of bringing everybody who is at different levels21 together and figure out how we really want to22 maximize the resources. My concern is when I see23 the inventory nobody knows who is doing what and24 one time the Cook County and the city funding justPage 160 1 bring people together. It's no matter a 2 convenience for family -- it's to be sure the3 community health is serving their needs and that's4 the collaboration.5 MR. ARNOLD: Yeah.6 MS. SCIAMMARELLA: Thank you.7 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you. That's why8 I thought it was so fundamentally important to9 reintegrate diabetes and obesity. It just has to 10 happen so --11 MS. BURNS: Hello. Thank you very12 much. I'm very glad to be here. I'm here to talk13 about secondary prevention at the community. My14 name is Anne Burns, A-N-N-E, B-U-R-N-S, and I'm a15 nurse also. Like one of our early speakers, I16 want to speak about secondary prevention at the17 community clinic level and I represent underserved18 populations with chronic disease.19 I have been working for seven20 years in a free clinic for uninsured working21 people with volunteer doctors in a nurse run22 clinic. It has been challenging and in response23 to that I have reached out and communicated with24 many different areas. And in relation to thePage 161 1 subject we just were on about registries, in case 2 I forgot, I want to mention the West Virginia3 Office of Services Research -- or what are they4 exactly? I always get that mixed up. The Office5 of Health Services Research, West Virginia6 University School of Medicine has done phenomenal7 work. It's all free.8 They built on the University of9 Washington's C-desk program which incorporated all 10 of the HRSA health disparities, collaboratives,11 benchmarks and, again, it's done, it's free and12 it's available and they give backup service and I13 recommend we build on that. So, anyway, what I14 want to advocate for is support for chronic15 disease management. Currently at the federally16 qualified healthcare community centers, there are17 no nurses. That means that you can't do chronic18 disease management. Chronic disease management is19 not just data reporting. It's an extension of20 postop nursing. It catches early decomposition,21 coordinates treatment, it increases activity and22 mobility and slows progress of chronic diseases.23 All chronic diseases. We don't need to split them24 up. We know perfectly well comorbidities is thePage 162 1 rule. You just don't get one and you're done. It 2 doesn't really matter. I'm in cardiovascular in3 particular by happenstance, but they're all4 involved. You have to be in touch with them all,5 but the risk factors for most are related to each6 other. So in keeping with Dr. Lorig's work at7 Stanford with self management support often you8 don't really need to split hairs on that.9 Why do you deal with chronic 10 disease management -- self management support? It11 improves outcomes for morbidity and mortality.12 There has been frustration with getting evidence13 for chronic disease management because so much of14 the work has been done on trivial outcomes of15 behavior. The Office of Accredited --16 Congregation in 2003 complained. There's just --17 it's not that we're not saying you don't need it,18 but there's no evidence. All the data is on19 trivial outcomes. The recent heart researchers in20 the Journal of American Medicine Association,21 however, has finally -- a huge very, very rigorous22 study, documented results regarding self23 management support. It is sort of paradoxical.24 They're saying it does not support it. However,Page 163 1 in their further discussions, you'll see they did 2 say except for underserved populations. I think3 we should build on that. At last we have data on4 actual mortality and morbidity to commend chronic5 disease management. Again, registries.6 Registries are huge. That's why I've worked with7 West Virginia to such an extent. I've been able8 to improvise with a retired Lucent programmer and9 develop the database for my population. 10 What I want to really advocate11 for is in chronic disease management, that12 clinicians do their own -- use the databases.13 Don't just be passive reporters, but use them with14 the populations to identify cohorts and also15 follow up with individuals. Once people use their16 data themselves instead of just being reports they17 become a lot more sensitive to the data quality18 issues. We're seeing terrible problems with19 electronic medical records, sloppy scanning,20 sloppy recording. So we've got a quivering bowl21 of jelly underneath the electronic medical records22 and medical homes and what is a meaningful use.23 Meaningful use is based on a bowl of jelly. If24 that data is all -- as bad as some of what I'vePage 164 1 seen. 2 So, finally, I'll give an3 example of this kind of use that I advocate.4 We -- with my cardiovascular population, 6005 patients I manage with two volunteer6 cardiologists, the DuPage County Health Department7 was wanting to partner for some smoking cessation8 so I went to my database and I asked how many of9 my hypertensive's have not been at goal in the 10 past year, are overweight and smoke. With that, I11 pulled down a core group and I only had 1512 capacity -- whoops. Times up. Fifteen capacity13 in each group so I pulled out a first set of 25,14 called them personally and said \"I've reserved you15 a spot. You are at high risk. I want you to have16 this opportunity.\" The health department was very17 pleased. We had 17 enrolled, 11 actually18 completed the program and they said they have not19 seen that kind of response.20 This was based on being able to21 study your population, both in aggregate and22 individually and I have a risk managed -- risk23 matrix that I use that will show you your24 population aggregate in different levels of risk,Page 165 1 but then with a pivot chart pull out who's the 2 list and where is your actual source data for3 this.4 MR. ARNOLD: Can you submit your5 documentation for that and some of the models?6 MS. BURNS: I actually spoke at the7 Illinois Public Health Institute --8 MR. ARNOLD: Yes.9 MS. BURNS: -- on this and I'm very 10 happy to share it. It's freeware and I just --11 for underserved patients with chronic diseases, I12 think we should make use of what we have for free.13 MR. ARNOLD: Right. Thank you.14 MS. BURNS: Anything else?15 MR. ARNOLD: I'm one of those16 believers of not reinventing the wheel.17 MS. BURNS: Thank you very much.18 MS. WEBB: All right. Good19 afternoon. Good afternoon, member of the Chronic20 Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Task21 Force. I'm Valerie Webb, W-E-B-B. I'm the22 current president of the Illinois Public Health23 Association, IPHA. We're a 7,000 member24 organization devoted exclusively to the matters ofPage 166 1 public health in Illinois. As the largest 2 affiliate of the American Public Health3 Association, IPHA represents individuals and4 organizations from local and state agencies,5 hospitals, communities, clinics and voluntary6 agencies, all whom have supported a healthy7 Illinois. Over IPHA's 70 year history, we've8 worked to fulfill the mission to lead an advanced9 public health practice. In response to the Task 10 Force hearings, IPHA identified several aspects of11 the state's chronic disease prevention and health12 promotion infrastructure that should be addressed13 including leadership epidemiology and14 surveillance, partnership, planning,15 interventions, program management and16 administration. But in the interest of time, I'd17 like to focus on just two of those performance18 improvements, epidemiology and surveillance, the19 cornerstone of public health and partnerships.20 However, we will submit complete21 documentation and explanation on all the22 components to the Task Force within the required23 time period as well as we will have other speakers24 at other hearings provide additional testimony.Page 167 1 So starting with the cornerstone of public health, 2 epidemiology and surveillance. IPHA recommends3 that IDPH, the Illinois Department of Public4 Health, should expand its commitment of resources5 to the behavioral risk factor surveillance system.6 The survey collects information on the behavioral7 risk factors associated with the development of8 chronic disease and will be an important strategy9 in measuring short-term progress. 10 IDPH should have sufficient11 resources to collect a statistically reliable and12 valid sample on an annual basis for all of the 10213 counties, the city of Chicago and the suburban14 Cook County area which I work in my full-time job.15 IDPH should also have the16 resources for analysis, interpretation and17 publication of the survey findings. The18 management of the survey can be done most19 efficiently at the state level. Number two, IPHA20 recommends that IDPH should also expand its21 commitment of resources to analysis of the22 hospital discharge database and the vital records23 system. These two data sets provide important24 information on the longer term impacts ofPage 168 1 prevention efforts and the burden of chronic 2 disease and morbidity and mortality. Due to the3 current lack of resources to invest in this4 information infrastructure, IDPH is often two5 years late in publishing annual vital statistic6 reports and has only limited ability to analyze7 and interpret the results.8 It is difficult to plan tactics9 or evaluate strategies when the best information 10 to you that is available is two years old.11 Okay. Partnerships. No sector12 of the healthcare system can address the burden of13 chronic disease and isolation. There are many14 partners who have a stake in the prevention.15 Therefore, all of these partners should have a16 hand in designing, implementing, monitoring and17 evaluating the systems overall performance as well18 as their contribution.19 Some of these partners includes20 the medical community, voluntary organizations,21 colleges and universities, faith based22 organizations, schools and families, state and23 local governments as well are essential to the24 effort.Page 169 1 Now, to my point on 2 partnerships. Coordination of policy and3 innovation strategies at the state level is4 essential for success. IDPH should work with the5 Illinois State Board of Education and with the6 Illinois Department of Human Services to ensure7 efforts to prevent tobacco and alcohol abuse in8 and out of the classroom are consistent.9 IDPH should work with the 10 Department on Aging to ensure support for11 community preventive health services. IDPH and12 IDHFS, Healthcare and Family Services, should13 ensure that preventive health services including14 self care education and other services required by15 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,16 are available to Medicaid recipients. IDHFS17 should continue its efforts to provide intensive18 health education and support to persons who19 consume excess amounts of healthcare services to20 treat their chronic health conditions. They21 should also take full advantage of the grants22 authorized by the Patient Protection and23 Affordable Care Act to develop programs for24 tobacco cessation, weight loss, reduce inPage 170 1 cholesterol, blood pressure -- control of blood 2 pressure and the prevention of management of3 diabetes among Medicaid beneficiaries.4 Through the Task Force, IDPH and5 IDHFS should collaborate on a media campaign6 required by the Patient Protection and Affordable7 Care Act to inform Medicare recipients of the8 availability and coverage of obesity related9 services. 10 All these partners have a role11 and should be a part of the Task Force's ongoing12 membership to work closely with IDPH at the state13 level and should be partners with local health14 departments in every community.15 In conclusion, these are16 recommendations and the others that I wasn't able17 to describe to you, but will present later and18 will have documentation on are developed to assist19 the Task Force to reform the delivery system for20 chronic disease prevention and to ensure adequate21 funding of the infrastructure so that the burden22 of chronic disease and disparities in the health23 status and the state's healthcare expenditures may24 be reduced. IDPH stands ready to assist the TaskPage 171 1 Force in any way. 2 MS. ARNOLD: Thank you very much.3 Valerie has done a wonderful job with IDPH as the4 president there. I always read the viewpoint you5 put out which is really phenomenal. A lot of6 great information on there. But, also, you know,7 one of the things that you were talking about is8 an interface which was making me think of this9 interface which is one between the hospital -- 10 between hospital systems and practices in the11 private sector versus a public health approach12 which is really a global approach to the13 population base dynamics and it seems like there's14 a bridge that needs to be crossed at that point15 because many conversations that were made were16 being directed at the data and local utilization17 of data and that would potentially increase the18 quality of it which is great, but the data sharing19 is another issue as well and how to bring those20 things into one kind of formulized system is21 another bridge to cross. It's formidable, but22 something we need to. So thank you very much.23 MS. QUADRI: Good afternoon -- good24 afternoon, Honorable Dr. Arnold and respectedPage 172 1 team. I'm happy and honored to be here. My name 2 is Zehra Quadri, Z-E-H-R-A, last name is Quadri,3 Q-U-A-D-R-I, and I am the advocate and volunteer4 from ZAM's Hope Community Resource Center located5 in Rogers Park in West Rogers Park. We have been6 a part of the community for the past last 107 years -- successful years. We serve lower income8 individuals from all walks of life. We are very9 thankful to the Department of Public Health for 10 being there for us throughout these years helping11 us to educate our clients and community members.12 I would like to thank Dr. Masud13 Ali and Dr. Wansia Ali. They are here always14 for -- always lending a hand and helping us to15 become more aware of -- helping us to become more16 aware of body and mind. We are serving seven17 different countries and we have after-school18 programs, senior services, ESL classes and health19 education.20 MS. KASI: Good afternoon. is Deenuka Kasi. D-E-E-N-U-K-A, last name Kasi,22 K-A-S-I, and I am currently a volunteer at ZAM's23 Hope and also a medical student. So, personally,24 as a medical student we come across variousPage 173 1 subjects that are vital to our knowledge. 2 Pathology being the most important because it3 helps us understand the abnormalities and the4 diseases. The most important are chronic disease5 that mostly occur because we do not take care of6 the problem head on or take notice of it first.7 This may be because of the lack8 of knowledge the community members have about9 healthy living. So chronic diseases such as heart 10 diseases, cancer, stroke and diabetes are the11 leading causes of death in the United States.12 Seven of every ten deaths in the US are caused by13 chronic conditions. Heart disease is the leading14 cause of death among both men and women followed15 by cancer and stroke and diabetes is the sixth.16 What we need to do is promote17 health wellness programs at schools to excite18 healthcare and community based settings so people19 can have more of an understanding of the diseases20 that occur.21 MR. ARNOLD: She must be brilliant22 because I never had time when I was a medical23 student for a public hearing.24 MS. QUADRI: My name is AishaPage 174 1 Quadri. A-I-S-H-A, last name Quadri, Q-U-A-D-R-I. 2 I'm also a volunteer to the executive director and3 a medical school student as well. The two4 projects that we are currently working on are the5 free health centers and providing Kosher soup6 kitchens. The free health center is because we7 want to provide equipment and, you know, lectures8 and stuff to make people understand and become9 more aware of what there is and what you can do. 10 I know we all love fried food. I don't know if11 you guys have been to Devon, but our community is12 mainly made up of south Asians and our food has so13 much oil and all the other good stuff, but it's so14 bad for us and our community is unaware of that15 and I know that I was unaware of it and I'm not16 sure if it's appropriate to name documentaries and17 stuff, but when I was in high school I watched a18 documentary which made me completely forget about19 fast food. It gave me a better understanding of20 what is out there and unfortunately our low income21 families they don't have time to prepare22 something. They don't even have money to, you23 know, give a proper meal at home. So we want to24 provide classes to help them, you know, realizePage 175 1 alternatives and to cooking. 2 I love cooking. When I'm not3 studying, all I do is cook and she can vouch for4 me, but it's always -- I'm trying to find5 alternative ways just to be healthy and providing6 a free health center it will allow people --7 especially seniors because if you think about it8 the youth today are learning so much about trying9 to live healthy and people are trying so much to 10 give all these children opportunities to exercise11 more and be more active, but the seniors who have12 been -- who have been here for a really long13 time -- I mean, especially mother's home cooking.14 People don't always, you know, give importance to15 exercising. I know that my grandparents because16 they have a facility in their area they're allowed17 to workout, but think about how many other people18 there are who don't have those facilities. So19 we're trying to provide facilities to those people20 who, you know, cannot maintain those because it21 does take a lot of money to go into workout places22 and stuff and then the soup kitchen there are so23 many students who cannot get hot lunch because of24 their religious requirements and nutritionPage 176 1 requirements and then their families cannot afford 2 to give them a proper meal to take to school.3 It's always fast food because it's so affordable.4 So we want to provide a soup kitchen so we can5 make food for people and then give it to the6 children and have these parents come and take7 classes so we can teach them different ways of8 cooking.9 MR. ARNOLD: So when you mention 10 soup kitchen, we normally think of people who are11 really homeless or low income. This is a12 different type of soup kitchen?13 MS. QUADRI: I mean, it is available14 to the community, but it's also a healthier soup15 kitchen.16 MR. ARNOLD: That's also the thing.17 MS. QUADRI: It's really vital to18 the community to be able to eat properly.19 MR. ARNOLD: Okay. Excellent. Very20 good.21 MS. QUADRI: I'm really sorry. Just22 one more quick thing. We are working -- we are23 receiving grants from your department for24 educating the community for STD and HIV issues.Page 177 1 This is really a very touchy subject for our 2 community and we are doing a phenomenal job in the3 community and the big thing I thought was people4 were going to throw rocks on me, but to be honest,5 they appreciate it. They are coming. They are6 more open. We are talking to kids. We are7 talking to the community. We are having free8 testing even though we are not receiving any9 funding and I'm working more than full-time as 10 executive director and I'm the founder for ZAM's11 Hope Community Resource Center and I would like12 you to visit our website and also a center if you13 can, please, www.zamshope.net. Thank you so much.14 MR. ARNOLD: And make sure you give15 the information so we can include that into the16 record as well and it's very, very good work. I'm17 very proud of you.18 MS. CAGAN: Good afternoon. My name19 is Elizabeth Cagan, E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H, C-A-G-A-N.20 I'm the executive director of White Crane Wellness21 Center, but, first, I would just like to thank the22 Task Force for the opportunity to engage the23 community to work together to promote health24 across Illinois. So we still value the messagePage 178 1 that you're sending here today. I'm here today as 2 part of my testimony to really highlight and3 emphasize the importance of chronic disease self4 management. So chronic disease self management5 why is it important? Why now?6 In 2007, approximately 387 million people in America were age 65 and older.8 Thirteen percent of the population. At least 809 percent of older Americans are living with at 10 least one chronic condition. Fifty percent have11 at least two chronic conditions. Healthcare12 expenditures increase as people age and their13 health deteriorates.14 US Department of Health and15 Human Services projects that the cost of16 healthcare will reach $3.6 trillion in 2014 up17 from $2.2 trillion in 2007. Medicare spending is18 projected to be nearly $935 billion by 2018. So19 why take care of your health and what does that20 mean?21 Again, as part of my testimony,22 I'd like to really emphasize the value, ethicacy23 and importance of disease self management programs24 and options of care. Self management programsPage 179 1 such as at Stanford University as our colleagues 2 are concerned here. The Stanford program3 developed by Kate Lorig addressed chronic health4 conditions, have demonstrated reduction in5 hospital days and physician visits, reveal the6 paradigm shifts, enhance disease management7 strategies, and they focus on health promotion and8 disease prevention. They successively implement a9 diverse -- in diverse populations and language 10 groups and in a variety of locations.11 For the first time ever here in12 Illinois, we've been able to implement them in13 Chinese, Korean, Filipino and south Asian14 communities. And with respect to national15 research outcomes of these disease self management16 programs, they've demonstrated to include17 communication with family members and physicians,18 fewer hospitalizations and visits to physicians19 and emergency rooms, no further increase in20 disability two years after the program,21 improvement in health status such as self reported22 health, fatigue, social activities and energy and23 finally improvement in health behaviors such as24 exercise.Page 180 1 Vulnerable populations such as 2 underserved, isolated, frail older adults have3 great difficulty in accessing health, wellness and4 social services. Barriers to access include5 physical, emotional and mental health problems,6 language, as well as cultural barriers, lack of7 financial resources, lack of insurance, lack of8 linguistically and culturally competent programs9 and services. Examples of chronic disease, 10 however, that can be mitigated and effected by11 such disease management programs include12 arthritis.13 With regard to arthritis, 4614 million American adults or one in five have some15 form of doctor diagnosed arthritis. In fact,16 arthritis is the most common cause of disability17 is the US rendering $128 billion to be spent on18 arthritis annually. Falls, according to CDC, more19 than 33 percent of adults age 65 and older fall20 each year in the United States. In 2000, the CDC21 estimated that the total medical cost of all fall22 injuries for people 65 and older to be $19.523 billion. Among older adults, falls are the24 leading cause of injury deaths, nonfatal injuriesPage 181 1 and hospital admission for trauma. Depression and 2 mental health, major depression can be highly3 disabling. Beyond symptomatic sadness,4 inactivity, cognitive deficits and attention5 problems, it often accompanies other serious age6 associated medical conditions such as heart7 disease, stroke cancer and diabetes. And like8 these other diseases, it robs older adults of9 their quality of life, reducing physical, mental 10 and social functioning and increasing healthcare.11 Finally, Alzheimer's disease and12 related dementia. Very sad. An estimated 5.313 million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer's14 disease. This figure includes 5.1 million people15 age 65 and older and 200,000 individuals under the16 age 65 have younger onset Alzheimer's disease.17 One in eight people age 65 and older, 13 percent,18 have Alzheimer's disease.19 To conclude, with respect to how20 do we address these problems, programs that can21 help include evidence based intervention such as22 the chronic disease self management developed23 Stanford University. They should be24 cost-effective. They should be community based.Page 182 1 There should be alternative for 2 institutionalization and they should provide3 choices for care that address physical and mental4 health issues such as adult day programs, in-home5 support, congregate meals, early disease detection6 prevention programs, health education support and7 caregiver support.8 Here today as executive director9 of White Crane Wellness Center, but also I am 10 chair of a regional subset of the Illinois Adult11 Day Services Association as well and I just want12 to give the panel ideas of ways we work together13 and alternatives to institutionalizations. Adult14 day programs in the state of Illinois and15 nationally are just extraordinary alternatives in16 nursing home placement and costs approximately one17 third of what we pay for nursing home placement,18 nursing home placement, which is often avoidable,19 premature and unnecessary for that older adult and20 for their families.21 Other alternative approaches to22 disease prevention includes fall prevention23 programs such as the evidence based matter of24 balance. Again, the chronic disease selfPage 183 1 management program developed by Stanford, the 2 Arthritis Foundation exercise program and healthy3 ideas of depression screening and case management4 for older adults. Our next steps could and I hope5 to be continued to engage are partner agencies in6 the discussion of these issues, additional needs7 prior characterization of needs and types of8 services we can offer to address these needs and,9 of course, our capacity to meet these needs with 10 quantifiable measure and I would just like in11 closing like to thank the Illinois Department of12 Public Health for sending this message and we've13 been watching the progress and passing of this14 state legislation and are very proud to be part15 Illinois at this time, but also wanted to thank16 Illinois Department of Public Health for your17 leadership in developing a very strong18 relationship between your department and the19 Illinois department on aging and the Illinois20 Aging Network overall. So -- and thank you for21 your patience today.22 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much.23 Your testimony was very, very well received. I24 want to make sure your submit those documents asPage 184 1 well, but one question about the cost analysis 2 and, you know, you were talking about metrics. I3 guess you have some documentation of the programs4 and how --5 MS. CAGAN: Yes. We can -- we'd be6 more than happy to forward on the state data with7 respect to comparing community based adult day8 services with nursing home placement and some of9 the Stanford data as well. 10 MR. ARNOLD: Thank you very much.11 Okay. Anyone else that wants to make a comment12 other than we want to go home. No?13 I just thank everyone for all of14 their attention and especially the panel. The15 Task Force was being pulled forward. They are16 doing this sort of pro bono, but their interest17 and their passion for this particular issue is18 really a paramount importance and success of the19 whole program. So all of the IPHA, all of the20 organizations that came forward today I really21 want to thank you for your time and dedication to22 this process.23 We will take the testimony into24 advisement as we start to create this document,Page 185 1 but, again, I think it was stated several times 2 and I know Valerie restated it as well is this3 intervention occurs at the person's home. It4 really occurs where the person actually opens a5 gym door or a clinic door or participates in a6 screening test or, you know, takes this carrot and7 says I'm going to replace my hot cakes with this8 carrot. So, you know, it really is at the level9 of the person who actually takes advantage of the 10 issues or takes advantage of the resources that11 are out there and we have to really keep a focus12 on education and prevention throughout the13 spectrum.14 Right now, we were talking about15 this statistics and one of the statistics that16 really alarmed me the other day was the idea that17 the CDC put a projection out that one in three18 children born in the year 2000 or after will19 develop diabetes in their lifetime. That is20 absolutely staggering. I don't know how we cannot21 look at that and say that we have to do a22 gargantuan effort, mega gargantuan effort to23 address that issue alone, but there are many, many24 chronic disease issues that we have to keep inPage 186 1 mind. Again, nothing happens in isolation and 2 comorbidities are quite common.3 So as we go forward we are going4 to try to take this information, distill it down5 into a document, but, again, the timeframe is at6 the end of December to submit this document and7 move it forward. However, the involvement of the8 groups who are here this is also a time period9 where you're coming onto a record and you have to 10 become part of a process that is ongoing. It must11 occur in every community in the state and it must12 be available to every citizen in the state. One13 of the comments I make when -- I'll tell you two14 very quick stories and let you go and -- you know,15 with any follow-up comments from people on the16 Task Force.17 One of the stories is that when18 people walk into the Agency they ask me what is19 the first step I should take, you know, coming20 into the agency. I haven't been in public health.21 And I always draw a little curve and say that22 there's 12.5 million people under this curve and23 that's about the number of people within the state24 of Illinois. I want you to take one point off ofPage 187 1 that and hold it in your hand and then I want you 2 to erase their gender, their race, their3 ethnicity, whether they're rural or city, I want4 you to erase their religious beliefs, what kind of5 clothing they are wearing, what kind of music they6 like, everything that's identifiable, the age, and7 then I want you to realize you have a human life8 in your hand. They are entrusting themselves to9 you to find the solution to really end the pain 10 and suffering and premature death that is11 occurring in itself and family members and the12 community members.13 So as we're moving forward, we14 will talk about many of the different disparities15 and these resources should follow a disparaged16 impact curve to make sure we're giving everyone17 access and doing a proportion to what their --18 what the consequences of these diseases they have19 for them. So as we're developing this matrix and20 we're looking at how to implement processes that21 actually are working, we are looking to you to22 actually give us guidance on what is working23 because you are at the ground level working with24 the person in the clinic.Page 188 1 And I always say that miracles 2 don't happen with the stroke of a pen in policy,3 but in the clinic when someone touches someone4 else's hand. So, going forward, one of the -- the5 second story is one about two martial arts masters6 and I'm glad the other two have left. There were7 these two martial arts masters that were walking8 down this dirt road together and as they were9 walking down the road there were two rows of pine 10 trees and they had lightening bugs in the trees11 and it was a full moon that night. So as they12 walking, one of the masters turned and looked at13 the other one and said, \"Master, tell me what is14 it when two ferocious tigers face each other in a15 heated battle and conflict? What is the result?\"16 And the other master looked at him and didn't say17 a word and continued to walk for another two miles18 and after walking the two miles the master19 stopped, turned and looked at the other and said,20 \"Master, when two ferocious tigers face each other21 in a heated battle and conflict, one of the tigers22 is going to be irreputably harmed. He's going to23 be maimed and live out the rest of his days in24 utter misery and pain\" and then he took two morePage 189 1 steps, turned around and looked at the master and 2 said, \"The other one will die.\"3 That's what happens when you're4 going for a goal, but you have a problem with5 either getting involved with a level of coercion6 where you're forcing things to happen or7 litigation or you're going to a level of8 arbitration or mediation. The best place to be is9 in a negotiation when you're negotiating a 10 collaborative effort to make sure you've reached11 the goal you want and that's to save the lives of12 the people in this state and to prevent pain and13 suffering and premature death.14 So, with that, I commend you all15 for being involved in the field, but I'm opening16 it to the other members because they are17 phenomenal. This chart is really the beginning of18 a framework that I really am looking at the most19 important part of any healthcare chart is the20 person receiving the intervention, always. And we21 have to make sure we keep focusing on that. So,22 with that, thank you for your time.2324Page 190 1 STATE OF ILLINOIS ) 2 ) SS.3 COUNTY OF COOK )45 I, Steven Brickey, Certified Shorthand6 Reporter, do hereby certify that I reported in7 shorthand the proceedings had at the trial8 aforesaid, and that the foregoing is a true,9 complete and correct transcript of the proceedings 10 of said trial as appears from my stenographic11 notes so taken and transcribed under my personal12 direction.13 Witness my official signature in and for14 Cook County, Illinois, on this 2010.1617181920 ___________________________ STEVEN BRICKEY, CSR 21 8 Monroe Street Suite 2007 22 Chicago, Illinois 60603 Phone: (312) 419-9292 23 CSR No. 084-004675 24 "}
