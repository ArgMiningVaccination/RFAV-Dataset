Order of Benef it Determination Rules 1. If another Plan does not have a COB p rovision, that Plan is the Primary Plan. 2. If another Plan has a CO B provision, the first of the following rules that apply will d etermine which Plan i s the Primary Plan: a. Subscr iber/Dependent. A Pla n that covers a person as a Subscriber i s Prim ary to a Plan th at covers the person as a de pendent . b. Subscriber/Dependent. If the person is a Medicare beneficiary, and, as a result of the pr ovisions of Title XVIII of the Soc ial Secu rity Act an d imple menting r egulations, Medicare is: i. Secondary to t he pla n covering the person as a dependent ; and ii. Primary to the plan covering the pers on as other than a dependent, Then the order of benefits is reversed so that the pla n covering the person as an em ployee, m ember, subscriber, policyholder or retiree is the seco ndary plan and the other plan coveri ng the perso n as a dependent is the primary plan. Dependen t Child/Parents 1. Not Separated or Divorced. When Health Plan and anothe r Plan cov er the s ame child as a Dependent of different persons, called \"parents\": (i) the Plan of the par ent whose birthday f alls earlier in the year is Primary to the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in the year; or ( ii) if both parents h ave the same birthday, the Pla n tha t covered a parent longer is Primary P lan. 2. Dependen t Child /Separat ed or D ivorced Pa rents. If two or more Pla ns cover a person as a depen dent child w hose parents are divorced or sep arated or are not li ving together, whethe r or not they have e ver been married: If a cou rt decree states that one of the parents is res ponsible for the dependen t child's h ealth care expenses or health care coverag e and the pl an of that parent has actual knowl edge of those term s, that plan is prima ry. If the parent wi th responsibili ty has no he alth care coverage for the dependent ch ild's h ealth care exp enses, but tha t parent 's spouse does , that parent's spouse's pla n is the pri mary plan. This item shall not a pply with respect to any plan year during which benefits are paid or provide d before the entity has actual knowledge of the court decr ee provi sion; 3. If a court dec ree stat es that both parent s are responsible for t he dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverag e, the provisions of Subparagraph (a) of t his paragra ph shall deter mine the order of benefits; 4. If a court d ecree s tates th at the parents ha ve joint cu stody without spe cifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expens es or he alth care co verage of the depende nt child, the provis ions of Subparagraph (a) o f this paragraph shall determine the order of b enefits; or 5. If there is n o court dec ree allocating responsibility for the chil d's health c are expenses or health care coverage, the or der of b enefits for the child are as follows: a. The plan coveri ng the custodi al parent; b. The plan covering custodi al parent's spouse; c. The plan coveri ng the non- custodial parent ; and then d.

For a dependent chi ld covered under m ore than one p lan of indi viduals who are not the parents of the c hild, t he order of be nefits shal l be determ ined, as appli cable, under the dependent c hild provisi ons above, as if those individua ls were pare nts of t he child. Dependent C hild/Own Coverage. 1. For a depende nt child who ha s coverage under either or both parents ' plans and als o has hi s or her own coverag e as a depende nt under a spouse's plan, the rule for \" Longer or Shorter Length of Cove rage\" applies. 2. In th e event the dependent child's coverage under the spou se's plan bega n on the same date as the dependent chil d's coverage un der ei ther or bot h parents' plans, the order of benefits shall be determined by Your Group E vidence of Coverage MDLG- BASE -SIG(01 -22)SOM 43 applying the birthday rule under t he \"Depe ndent Child/ Parents Not Separated or Divorced\" provi sion above. Active/Inactiv e Employee. A Plan that covers a person as an e mployee who is neither la id off nor retired (or as such an employee 's dependent) is the Primary Plan. The Plan w hich covers that person as a l aid off or retired employee (or as such an employe e's dependent) is the secondary plan. If the other plan does not have this rul e, and as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benef its, this ru le is ignored. COBRA o r State Cont inuation Coverage. 1. If a person whose cover age is provided pursu ant to C OBR A or under a right of continuation pursuant to state or ot her f ederal law is covered under another plan, the plan covering the person as an employe e, member, subscriber , or retiree or covering the per son as a dependent of an employee, member, subscriber , or retiree i s the primary plan and the plan covering that s ame p erson pur suant to COBRA or unde r a right of continuation pursuant to stat e or other f ederal law is the seco ndary plan. 2. If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a resu lt, the pla ns do not agre e on the order of benefits, this rule is ignore d. Longer/Shorte r Length of Coverage . If none of t he above rules determines th e order of b enefits, the Plan that has covered a Subscriber longer is Primary to the Plan wh ich has covere d the Subsc riber for the s horter time. Effect of COB on the Benef its of this Plan When Health Plan is the Pr imary Plan, CO B has no effect on the benef its or Serv ices provided under thi s Agreem ent. When Health Plan is a Secondary Plan as t o one or more othe r Plans, it s benefits may be coordinated with the Primary Plan ca rrier u sing the guide lines below.

At the Member's request, Health Plan will prov ide or arrange for co vered Servi ces and then s eek coordination with a Primary Plan. 1. Coordinat ion w ith This Pl an's Benefits.

The benefi ts that would be payabl e for Allowa ble Expenses under one or more of the othe r Plans, in the absence of pr ovisions with a purpose like that of this COB provisio n, whet her o r not a c laim thereon is made that exceeds Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case , the Health Plan benefits will be coordinated, or the reasonable cash valu e of any Services provi ded by Health Plan may be recovered, fr om the Prima ry Plan, so that they and the benefits payabl e under the other Plans do not total more than the Allowable E xpen ses. 2. Right to Reserve and Release Needed Inform ation. Certain infor mation is need ed to apply these COB rules. Health Plan will decid e the i nformation it needs, and may get that information from , or give it to, any ot her organiz ation or person. Health Plan need not tell, or get th e consent of, any per son to do this. Each per son claiming benefits under Health Plan must give Health Plan any inf ormat ion it ne eds. 3. Facility of Payme nt.
