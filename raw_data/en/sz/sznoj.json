However, little is known aboutthe use of herbal medicine by patients with gynecologic can-cers. This study aimed to assess the use of herbal products bygynecologic cancer patients compared with healthy controls. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department for Gynecology and Obstetrics of Erlangen Uni-versity Hospital and included 201 patients with gynecologiccancer and 212 healthy controls. Use of herbal medicineswas evaluated using a standardized questionnaire. Medical in-formation on cancer patients was collected from hospital re-cords. Group comparisons were done using a logistic regres-sion model. Risk ratios were assessed using a Poisson regres- sion model. Results Gynecologic cancer patients used herbal medicine significantly less often than healthy persons. 69% of gyneco-logic cancer patients and 81% of healthy participants re-ported using herbal products. 40% of cancer patients and56% of healthy persons reported using plants for medicinalpurposes. Motives of cancer patients for using herbal medi-cine included treatment of cancer-related symptoms. The ma- jor source of information for both groups was family and friends. Conclusions Although herbal medicine was used less by pa- tients with gynecologic cancer, herbal products were used byboth cancer patients and healthy individuals.

Patterns published online: 2021-06-21Introduction More and more information is becoming available about the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) or integrative medicine by patients with cancer. Surveys of patients with gyne-cologic cancer have shown that approximately 40 -50% of pa- tients use some form of CAM [1 -4]. The majority of CAM rem- edies, such as vitamins, herbal medicine, or plant extracts, aretaken orally [2, 3]. Herbal medicines and herbal supplements areamong the most popular CAM products. A systematic literaturereview on the use of herbal supplements in the United Kingdom reported that up to 22% of cancer patients were taking herbal supplements [5]. Reasons given by patients for using CAM, including herbal medicines, included treatment of cancer-related symptoms andimprovement of quality of life [6]. Herbal medicine is an integral part of Western traditional med- icine. According to the definition of the World Health Organiza-tion (WHO), herbal medicines include types of medicine that use herbs or herbal materials, herbal preparations, and finished herbal products containing parts of plants or materials made from plantsas the active ingredient [7]. In Germany, certain forms of tradi-tional herbal medicine such as homeopathy and anthroposophicmedicine are considered to be part of the specialized therapy op-tions described in the German Medicines Act and have beengranted special approval status [8]. Recent estimates about thedrug market in Germany show that herbal medicines represent approximately 30% of over-the-counter medications [9].However, the use of herbal medicine varies widely across Eu- rope. A single medicinal plant may be regarded as an herbal med-icine, food, functional food, or dietary supplement in different countries, depending on each country s national regulations on different medicines [5]. Although strict rules on the quality andquantity of the ingredients of herbal medicines and their labelingapply to herbal medicines, the same does not apply to food prod-ucts and dietary supplements, making the market for herbal prod-ucts extremely diverse. To obtain authorization from the relevantnational drug authority to market a product as a medicinal prod-uct, herbal medicines and herbal medicinal products require a full quality dossier, as well as evidence of efficacy and safety, either based on clinical trials or from scientific literature or bibliographicdata [10 -12]. Dietary supplements and food products, on the other hand, are not the responsibility of drug approval authorities,so that there are no rules regarding evidence of their quality, effi-cacy, and safety. Dietary and food supplements involve concen-trated nutrients or other substances with a nutritional or physio-logical effect that are sold in \"doses \", i.e., in the form of tablets or capsules, and are regulated as foodstuffs [13]. Unfortunately, it is not always obvious if an herbal product is being marketed asfood or as a medicinal product. For example, peppermint leavesused to prepare an herbal infusion can be marketed as a foodstuffor as an herbal medicine. To the best of the authors knowledge, there is no definition of an herbal product that is independent ofits purpose as a medicinal product or food. The heterogeneityamong herbal products increases the difficulty for healthcare pro- fessionals when counseling patients, as well as the difficulty pa- tients have when choosing a safe but also potent herbal medicine.formed about the herbal products used by their patients as this will allow them to take their patients self-medication with herbal medicine into account. Counseling by oncologistson the use of herbal medicine should be -707 Science | Original Article Phytotherapy, or treatment with herbal medicine, includes the use of potent plants that may cause side effects or interact withdrugs [14,15]. Caution is needed, particularly when herbal prod-ucts are used to treat side effects associated with cancer therapy,as herbal medicines may interact with the chemotherapeuticagents, for example, by increasing the toxicity or reducing the ef-fectiveness of the cancer therapy. Novel therapy approaches avail-able to treat gynecologic cancers, for example, poly(adenosine di- phosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, may be affected by interactions caused by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes [16,17]. Some recommendations therefore go as far as discouragingthe use of herbal supplements altogether [18]. In addition, pa-tients often do not disclose their use of CAM and herbal medicinesto the physicians treating them [4, 19 -24]. In order to provide optimal therapy to patients with gyneco- logic cancer and also take their personal wish to use CAM and herbal medicine into account, it is important to know which herb- al medicines are used by patients with gynecologic cancer andwhether there are any differences in the use of herbal medicineby gynecologic carcinoma patients and by heathy persons. Methods Description of study The study was approved by the local ethics committee (referencenumber 255_16 B) and the study protocol complied with the Dec-laration of Helsinki. All of the participants provided written in-formed consent. This retrospective cross-sectional study was con-ducted at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Erlan-gen University Hospital. Between December 2016 and January 2017, a standardized questionnaire on the use of herbal products was developed and validated in a group of 29 patients receiving follow-up care afterbreast cancer and five patients from the hospital s integrative medicine consultancy service (see questionnaire in the Support-ing Information 1). These patients received the original question-naire and were asked to evaluate it on a separate evaluation sheetwhich included items on \"comprehensibility, \"\"complexity, \"\"time required for completion, \"and whether the patients \"felt comfort- able answering the questionnaire \"or had any suggested improve- ments. Minor revisions to the questionnaire were adopted afterthe validation phase and before the questi onnaire was used for the final survey. The cross-sectional survey took place between March 2017 and December 2018. The questionnaire was administered to fe-male patients with breast cancer or gynecologic cancer, and tohealthy women attending appointments for preventive medical check-ups. A total of 868 questionnaires were returned. Four questionnaires had to be excluded, as they had been answeredby the same patient. To be eligible for inclusion in the analysis,participants had to have a diagnosis of gynecologic carcinoma orbe a healthy woman attending a check-up. A total of 413 data setswere available for analysis. Data of breast cancer patients were notincluded in this evaluation but will be provided in a separate anal-ysis.The participants clinical records were used to collect informa- tion on patient and tumor characteristics. All of the participantscompleted the validated questionnaire on the use of plant prod-ucts. The questionnaire comprised one general question on theplants used by the participants and included five items with ques-tions on the type of use, duration of use, reasons for use, as well asinformation on the medical use of specific plant products (Sup-porting Information 1). For the purposes of the questionnaire, a plant product or herbal product was defined as any processed product derived from plants, irrespective of its regulatory status.Both herbal medicines and food products or dietary supplementswere included. Statistical considerations Statistical evaluation was performed using descriptive statisticsand included calculations of absolute numbers, percentages, means, and standard deviations. The group of patients with gyne- cologic cancer was compared with the group of healthy controls.Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess age differencesbetween the groups. A logistic regression model adjusted for agewas used to assess differences in plant use between the groups.Risk ratios for numbers of plants used and sources of recommen-dations were assessed using a Poisson regression model. A p valueof 0.05 was set as the threshold for significance. All calculations were carried out using the statistics program IBM SPSS, version 21 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA). Missing data wereexcluded from the analysis. Results Characteristics of participants A total of 413 participants were included in the analysis: 201 inthe group with gynecologic carcinomas and 212 in the group ofhealthy controls. The mean age was 57.2 (\u00b1 13.9) years in thegroup of cancer patients and 49.4 (\u00b1 13.5) years in the group ofhealthy controls. The healthy participants were significantly youn-ger than the cancer patients. The majority of cancer patients hadovarian cancer (43%) or were in a post-treatment setting (45%).At the time of completing the survey, 20 patients (25%) were re- ceiving chemotherapy, 26 patients (13%) were receiving targeted therapy, and 139 patients (69%) were not receiving systemic ther-apy. Table 1 lists the participants characteristics. Use of plant products There were 138 users of plant products (69%) among the patients with gynecologic cancer. By comparison, more healthy partici-pants used plant products (n = 172, 81%). The difference was sta- tistically significant. The plants most commonly used by both groups were ginger, peppermint, green tea, chamomile, fennel,sage, stinging nettle, arnica, caraway, and olive. The healthy par-ticipants used sage (p = 0.003), caraway (p = 0.002), and olive(p = 0.004) more often. In comparison with the healthy controls,patients with gynecologic cancer used fewer plant products(RR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.70 -0.89). No specific plant was used more often by patients with gynecologic cancer compared with healthy 701Theuser A-K et al. Patterns -707 | \u00a9 2021. The author(s). participants. Table 2 provides a summary of the plants used by healthy controls and cancer patients. The mean number of plant products used by cancer patients was 3.3 (\u00b1 2.7), compared to 4.1 (\u00b1 3.1) used by healthy partici- pants. While 70% (n = 319) of the plants were used over a longer period of time (more than 8 weeks) by oncologic patients, 55%(n = 387) of the plants were used for more than 8 weeks byhealthy participants. The number of plants used for a short period(less than 8 weeks) was 117 (26%) for patients with gynecologiccancer and 293 (41%) for healthy participants. Although therewere no significant differences between the two groups with re-gard to the long-term use of plant products (RR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.83 -1.13), more healthy participants used plant products for short periods (RR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.35 -0.54). Use of plant products for medicinal purposes The number of healthy participants who used plants for medicinal purposes was significantly higher compared to patients withgynecologic cancer. While 56% of the healthy participants(n = 119) stated that they used plants for medicinal purposes, only 40% of patients with gynecologic cancer (n = 81) did so(p = 0.027). The plants used most often for medicinal purposes were arnica, ginger, sage, chamomile, fennel, peppermint, valer-ian, stinging nettle, caraway, and calendula. No statistically signif- icant differences were observed between the groups with regard to individual plants, with the exception of fennel (p = 0.021) andpeppermint (p = 0.014), which were used more often by healthyparticipants. Patients with gynecologic cancer used fewer plantproducts for medicinal purposes than healthy participants(RR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.58 -0.85). Table 3 lists the plants used for medicinal purposes. The most common symptoms treated with plant products are listed in Table 4 . Respiratory complaints and common colds were the symptoms reported most often by healthy participants(n = 58, 49%), followed by gastrointestinal complaints (n = 31,26%), and anxiety or trouble sleeping (n = 26, 22%). The mostcommon symptoms reported by cancer patients were gastroin-testinal complaints (n = 14, 17%), anxiety or trouble sleeping(n = 13, 16%), as well as cancer, impaired immune system, andrespiratory complaints/common cold (each n = 10, 12%). Sources of recommendations for plant products The numbers of plant products recommended for medicinal pur-poses by physicians, pharmacists, alternative practitioners, familyand friends, internet/newspapers, or other sources are listed in Table 5 . Participants mainly received their information about herbal medicine from family and friends. No statistically signifi-cant differences between the two groups were observed with re- gard to the number of plants recommended by other sources of information.Table 1 Characteristics of patients and healthy controls.

The author(s).GebFra Science | Original Article Discussion Although herbal medicine is one of the most popular types of CAM used by patients with gynecologic cancer with a prevalenceof up to 23%, little is known about the actual herbal products orplants used by these patients [2]. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first study that has focused exclusively onpatients with gynecologic cancer and their use of herbal productsor herbal medicines. The study showed that cancer patients use herbal medicine less frequently than healthy persons. The use of herbal products specifically for medicinal purposes is more common amonghealthy individuals. However, patients with gynecologic cancerusually use herbal medicinal products for a longer period(> 8 weeks). The major source of information about herbal medi-cines in both groups was family and friends. The present study consisted of a large group with a total of 413 participants, of whom 201 were patients with gynecologic cancers. In Germany, the annual incidence of gynecologic cancers is around 26000, which amounts to around 10% of all cancer di-agnoses [25]. Carcinomas of the uterus are the most commontype of gynecologic cancer in Germany [26 -28]. However, the majority of cancer patients in our study had ovarian cancer. Earlierstudies have shown that patients with ovarian cancer are particu-larly likely to use CAM, including herbal medicine [2]. A possibleexplanation is that the use of herbal medicine may be associated with the use of systemic treatment. In addition to surgery, pa- tients with ovarian cancer often also receive systemic treatmentssuch as chemotherapy or novel therapies such as treatment with PARP inhibitors [17, 29], which are prone to have side effects. Treatment for the side effects of cancer therapy is one of the most common reasons for using CAM, including herbal medicine [1, 2].Table 3 Use of plants for medicinal purposes by patients with gynecologic cancer and healthy controls.

The mean age of the cancer patients included in this survey was 57 years, 10 years older than the group of healthy partici-pants. Although gynecologic cancers such as ovarian cancer mayoccur in patients younger than 45, the probability of developingcancer generally increases with age [30]. The survey investigated the use of plant products in patients with gynecologic cancers and compared it with that of controls.For the purposes of this study, a plant product was considered to be any product containing a plant as a major ingredient, regard- less of its regulatory status, e.g., food products, dietary supple-ments or herbal medicines, and irrespective of the number ofplants contained in the product. To the best of the authors knowl- edge, there is no standardized definition of an herbal product. Thedefinition depends on the regulatory context which determineshow the product may be sold. In Germany, there are differentways in which herbal products are used, for example as a food- stuff, an herbal medicine or as part of a dietary supplement. While herbal medicines must comply with different quality standardsand safety parameters, this level of control is not required forfoodstuffs. The EMA defines an herbal medicinal product as \"any medicinal product, exclusively containing as active ingredientsone or more herbal substances, one or more herbal preparations,or a combination of the two \"and an herbal substance as \"all mainly whole, fragmented or cut plants, plant parts, algae, fungi, lichen in an unprocessed, usually dried, form, but sometimes fresh. Certain exudates that have not been subjected to a specifictreatment are also considered to be herbal substances \", while herbal preparations are \"preparations obtained by subjecting herbal substances to treatments such as extraction, distillation,expression, fractionation, purification, concentration or fermen-tation. These include comminuted or powdered herbal sub-stances, tinctures, extracts, essential oils, expressed juices and processed exudates \"[31]. When evaluated in the context of food, botanicals are defined as \"all botanical materials (e.g. whole, frag- mented or cut plants, plant parts, algae, fungi and lichens) \"and botanical preparations are \"all preparations obtained from botan- icals by various processes (e.g. pressing, squeezing, extraction,fractionation, distillation, concentration, drying up and fermenta-tion). \"[32] Which of these definitions applies, depends on the purpose for which these herbal products are sold. However, this differentiation may not always be clear to the consumer of the product. The WHO provides a definition for a finished herbal prod-uct as follows: \"Finished herbal products consist of one or more herbal preparations made from one or more herbs (i.e. from dif-ferent herbal preparations made of the same plant as well as herb-al preparations from different plants. Products containing differ-ent plant materials are called \"mixture herbal products \"). Finished herbal products and mixture herbal products may contain exci- pients in addition to the active ingredients. However, finished products or mixture herbal products to which chemically definedactive substances have been added, including synthetic com-pounds and/or isolated constituents from herbal materials, aren o tc o n s i d e r e dt ob e \"herbal \".\"[33]. The WHO document also states that \"Herbal preparations are the basis for finished herbal products and may include comminuted or powdered herbal ma-terials, or extracts, tinctures and fatty oils of herbal materials. They are produced by extraction, fractionation, purification, con-centration or other physical or biological processes. They also in- clude preparations made by steeping or heating herbal materialsin alcoholic beverages and/or honey, or in other materials. \"[33]. The subjects in our study were expected to complete the ques-tionnaire themselves without assistance. Therefore, we cannot as-sume that our study subjects were familiar with the correct defini-tion of an herbal product, which depends on its regulatory con-text. Hence, we opted for a more feasible and less complex defini- tion and summarized all plant-derived products as herbal prod- ucts. Use of herbal products was high in both groups. A review fo- cusing on herbal medicine use among adult cancer patients inthe United Kingdom estimated that between 3.1% and 21.8% ofthe patients used phytotherapy [5]. The figure in the presentstudy was considerably higher. Even when only evaluating theuse of plant products for medicinal purposes, 40% of cancer pa- tients reported using herbal medicines. CAM use, including the use of herbal medicines, is often associated with female cancerpatients, younger age, and higher socioeconomic status [34 -36]. Herbal products are generally considered to be safe, and the level of acceptance for them in the general population is high.However, healthy participants in this study used plant productsconsiderably more often than patients with gynecologic cancer.Possible reasons for this may be that cancer patients are cautious about self-medication and fear potential drug interactions and side effects [37]. Cancer patients may also have already receivedseveral other medications and therefore did not wish to take anymore pills. Many doctors also discourage the use of herbal medi-cines due to a fear of interaction with drug therapy [15]. Apart from sage, caraway, and olive, there were no differences between the two groups with regard to the use of specific medic-inal plants. Healthy participants used these products more often than cancer patients. The plants were commonly used as food products, as spices or herbal infusions, and are characterized bytheir distinctive aromatic smell and taste. Similar findings wereobserved for the use of plants for medicinal purposes. Healthyparticipants used peppermint and fennel, both easily identifiedby their characteristic smell and taste, significantly more oftenthan patients with gynecologic cancer. Patients receiving chemo-therapy often have gastrointestinal symptoms with disruption of the mucosal membranes and become sensitive to tastes and smells [35]. These patients may therefore avoid using strong-tast-ing or strong-smelling plant products such as sage, caraway, fen-nel, or peppermint. The plants most commonly used for medicinal purposes were arnica, ginger, sage, and chamomile, which are common rem-edies for general complaints such as wounds, gastrointestinalsymptoms, respiratory symptoms, and inflammations [38, 39]. This is consistent with the symptoms reported by the survey participants for which they used herbal medicines. The most com-mon symptoms treated with herbal remedies were respiratorycomplaints or common cold, gastrointestinal complaints, andanxiety. All of these symptoms are regular indications for treat-ment with over-the-counter medicines [39,40]. Generally, therewere few differences in the indications for using herbal medicinesbetween the two groups. However, some of the reasons given for the medicinal use of plant products differed between the groups. 704Theuser A-K et al. Patterns and -707 | \u00a9 2021. The author(s).GebFra Science | Original Article Whereas healthy participants turned to herbal medicine to treat general symptoms/general conditions, cancer patients reasons included cancer symptoms and boosting their immune system.This is unsurprising, as immunodeficiency is one of the most com-mon issues that cancer patients face during treatment [35]. Sim-ilar observations have been made in other studies of cancer pa-tients, in which mostly nonspecific r easons such as improving health or fighting cancer have been reported [5]. Significantly fewer cancer patients used herbal medicine to treat common colds or respiratory symptoms. The present study found that patients with gynecologic cancer used plants less often than healthy participants. However, whencancer patients used herbal products, they persisted in usingthem a lot longer. Although there were no differences betweenhealthy participants and cancer patients with regard to the num-bers of plants used for more than 8 weeks, cancer patients used less than half as many plants for short periods of less than 8 weeks. One possible explanation for this could be that cancer patients aremotivated to maintain a constant treatment regimen. In addition,patients with gynecologic cancer may suffer long-term side ef-fects of cancer treatment and therefore require long-term care. Women using herbal supplements and CAM products have previously reported that friends or magazines were their most im-portant sources of information regarding plant products [41]. This finding is in accordance with the present study. It is notable that for cancer patients, physicians were not the first source theyconsulted about herbal medicine. Only about half of the patientswith gynecologic cancer disclosed their use of CAM, includingherbal medicine, to their treating physician [19, 42, 43]. Reasonsfor this given by patients ranged from a perception that physi-cians are not interested in patients self-medication to a fear that doctors might discourage the use of herbal medicines [41]. On the other hand, many patients may wish to receive counseling on integrative medicine from their treating physician [4,37,44]. Thisshows that it is important for doctors to be aware that patients areusing herbal medicines, and doctors should encourage their pa-tients to tell them which herbal products they are using. Someherbal products have been reported to have an influence on can-cer or to interact with cancer treatment [16]. For example, phy-toestrogens from red clover or black cohosh may interact with hormone-sensitive cancers, and St. John s wort is a known CYP3A4 inducer that affects orally administered drugs [15,45]. Otherplants, however, may be safely administered even while patientsare receiving systemic therapy and may therefore be an attractiveoption to treat therapy-associated side effects or symptoms. The present study has several strengths and limitations. It should be borne in mind that it was a cross-sectional study. As itwas a one time survey, no follow-up data on the participants was available. The survey was also conducted only at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Erlangen University Hospital.Cancer patients or healthy persons being treated in an outpatientsetting were not included in the study. It should also be noted thatthe two groups differed with regard to age, with the cancer pa-tients being on average about 10 years older than the healthy par-ticipants.However, the study also has several strengths. It was possible to include a large number of participants in both groups, and thedrop-out rate was very low. Data were collected using a standard-ized questionnaire, which was validated for comprehensibility andcomplexity. The group of cancer patients included in the surveyincluded all stages of disease and treatment and can therefore beregarded as representative. Usually, the use of herbal medicines isnot covered in common hospital questionnaires and little data is available on the use of herbal medicine by patients with gyneco- logic cancer. Gynecologic oncologists should be aware of their patients use of herbal medicines and their motivations so that they can provideinformed counseling and ensure their patients safety during can- cer treatment. Conclusion This study shows that patients with gynecologic cancer as well ashealthy persons are regular users of herbal products and herbalmedicines. However, patients with gynecologic cancer use herbalmedicines significantly less than healthy individuals. The reasonsgiven for using herbal medicines usually involved treatment ofgeneral symptoms, but cancer patients also use them to treatcancer-related symptoms. This should be taken into consideration by gynecologic oncologists, and patients should be actively en- couraged to disclose their use of herbal products to their physi-cians. It is only when everyone involved has all the necessary infor-mation that safe therapy decisions can made which take the pa-tients needs into consideration and may improve cancer treat- ment. This is one of the first studies to carry out a systematic evalua- tion of gynecologic cancer patients use of herbal products in comparison with healthy persons. The findings will need to be confirmed in further studies. Acknowledgements We are grateful to all of the patients, to the research personnel involved, and to the hospital staff.
