The NADA protocol has been shown in a variety of clinical settings to be beneficial in the process of detoxification from substance abuse as well as to help with the emotional, physical and psychological attributes involved in addictions. The detoxification protocols, in contrast with much of Chinese medicine, involve no diagnosis and are usually not modified in any way. Due to the fixed nature of the protocol, many localities allow non-acupuncturists to administer the auricular acupuncture treatments. Generally speaking, the protocol is usually administered on its own without the addition of other ear or body acupuncture points. The length of the treatment depends greatly on the setting in which it is administered and the status of the patient. In general, the needles are left in for 25 - 60 minutes. The treatments listed below are used in many detoxification/rehabilitation facilities. [National Acupuncture Detoxification Assocation] ( [NADA](http://www.acudetox.com/)) Treatment [NADA Website](http://www.acudetox.com/)) \"At five designated earpoints in each auricle (outer ear), NADA-trained clinicians apply fine gauge, sterilized, one-time use stainless steel needles just under the skin, where they remain for up to an hour while the patient (in most circumstances) relaxes quietly in a comfortable chair. Ordinarily, groups of patients sit together while undergoing the treatment. The procedure functions as an adjunct to a comprehensive addiction treatment program offering the basic therapeutic elements of counseling, education, family involvement, mutual support group involvement, supportive health care of a general nature. Patients in all types of treatment settings including inpatient, outpatient, incarcerated, shelters, harm reduction and street outreach can utilize this treatment. Among the benefits reported by patients and clinicians are improved program retention, a more optimistic and cooperative attitude toward the process of recovery, as well as reductions in cravings, anxiety, sleep disturbance and need for pharmaceuticals.\" [American College of Addictionology and Compulsive Disorders (] [ACACD](http://www.acacd.com/)) Treatment Protocol The information on our site is drawn from our own lecture notes and clinical experience.
