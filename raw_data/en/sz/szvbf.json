Full body aromatherapy massage is thought of as the ultimate in relaxation for mind and body. Aromatherapy massage fuses the benefits of traditional massage with the healing properties of essential oils to relax the muscles, stimulate the body's olfactory system, and calm or rejuvenate the nervous system. In this way it actually has a lot in common with traditional [Turkish hammam benefits](https://www.estespa.uk/blog/10-exceptional-hammam-health-benefits). The key difference between aromatherapy massage, and for example Swedish massage, is the use of essential or concentrated oils made from plant extracts (e.g., flowers, leaves, fruit) which are specifically blended for use on the skin and/or for inhalation during a spa treatment. During an aromatherapy massage a variety of skin-safe oils are typically available for a spa guest to select from; natural aromatic scents on offer may include eucalyptus, jasmine, peppermint, lavender, tea tree, bergamot, chamomile, or ylang-ylang. Each type of plant extract serves a purpose \u2014 some are more calming like chamomile for instance, and some extracts are more invigorating and reviving like peppermint, pine, and grapefruit. Generally before your aromatherapy massage begins, most spa attendants will check in with you to see what type of aroma you prefer, or they may ask how you want to feel after your massage in order to select the most appropriate aromatherapy massage oil for your spa treatment. For example, if you are feeling lethargic, then cinnamon or lemongrass will help to boost your energy levels. If you are feeling stuffy in the head, then you should try a peppermint oil massage, as the menthol will help to open your airways and ease congestion. Mood-boosting essential oils include anything in the citrus family like orange, lemon, lime, and grapefruit. If you are unsure what scent to choose for your treatment, then ask the massage therapist, they will recommend the best one for you. When it comes to self-care and holistic health, you will benefit from any and all types of massage styles. People looking for something beyond just a purely physical massage will be drawn to aromatherapy massage because it addresses cognitive and emotional wellbeing, as well as physical health. Aromatherapy massage benefits include: pain management, control of inflammation, improved mood, emotional healing, mindfulness, as well as boosting health and your body's immunity. And of course, aromatherapy massage is a relaxing sensory experience that can be customised to your specific needs. That amazing feeling you have after a massage is not only because your muscles are relaxed and loose again. That overall good feeling is also because your nervous system is relaxed and happy! You shouldn't underestimate the importance of your nervous system when it comes to optimal health. Aromatherapy massage is an ideal holistic health treatment to align your mind and body; it is considered one of the best treatments for issues associated with the nervous system. For example, aromatherapy massage has a positive therapeutic effect on the brain's limbic system which helps to regulate your heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, stress levels, hormones, and even your memory. Aromatherapy can help alleviate depression and anxiety, improve motivation, and boost your mood and energy. Aromatherapy massage is also very beneficial for the respiratory system, as specific plant extracts, like lemon and peppermint, can help to ease conditions like asthma and hay fever. Another spa treatment that is excellent for respiratory health is a hammam spa Turkish bath. The [new Este Medical Group spa in Birmingham](https://www.estespa.uk/hammam-spa-treatments) will offer hammam spa services along with aromatherapy massage, plus a variety of other massage treatments to help you heal body and mind. Hammam bathing rituals are both meditative and sensory, not that far off from an aromatherapy spa experience.
