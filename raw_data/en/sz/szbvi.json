Want to detox your brain as well as your body? Break free of your devices and go on a digital detox. Digital detox is the latest trend in Spa and Wellness travel for 2015, but the best Spas have been doing this for years. Nowadays we are more globally connected than ever before, but life in the digital age is far from ideal. Half of Brits admit to checking work e-mails while on holiday, while a third regret spending so much time on them. The negative psychological and social impact is apparent. We are connecting with technology and in turn disconnecting from human interaction. Our ability to stay balanced in this time of exponential technological growth and create healthy relationships with our digital devices will determine the future of humanity. By switching off your digital gadgets it allows you to switch off from life completely which is the best way to de-stress and reconnect with yourself and those around you without any interference. It also gives you a chance to fully relax and enjoy the sights and scenery and to savour your well earned break. By doing this you will feel the benefits more and will return to work feeling invigorated and refreshed. With the rise of this digital detox revolution more and more people are requesting 'black-hole-resorts', where you hand over your iPhone or tablet on arrival, and where emptiness and silence are the new luxuries. It's a very tempting proposition in an age of acceleration to simply unplug, stand still and to go somewhere and do nothing at all. It is SLOW travel and perfectly achieved at some great Spas and Wellness Retreats. At Healing Holidays we offer a wide range of spas, clinics and retreats which adhere to this digital detox. Some of the most popular ones are listed below. [SHA Wellness Clinic](/accommodation/spain/sha-wellness-clinic), Spain - At SHA Wellness Clinic the use of mobile phones and music devices in the communal areas is completely forbidden in the interest of everyone's tranquillity.
