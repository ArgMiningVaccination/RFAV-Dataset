This herbal remedy not only boosts the immune system - it could well be the cure to the common cold", "sitename": "The Guardian", "date": "2000-04-09", "cleaned_text": "Five years ago, the majority of people would have dismissed herbal medicine as being either quackery or having off-puttingly New Agey connotations and would not have considered trying it. However, the last year or so has seen the emergence of a growing movement of people who prefer to rely on one small flower's healing powers than on many more conventional medicines. Echinacea (commonly known as coneflower) is one of the world's most valued medicinal herbs. Although its name is derived from the Greek word for hedgehog, an association inspired by the flower's spiky central zone, echinacea - a native of central North America - was originally cultivated in the US. Today, however, you're likely to come across echinacea that's been grown in the rich, sandy soils of Europe, too. Its daisy-like flowers are gathered in full bloom from mid-summer to early autumn, and the roots of four-year-old plants are lifted in autumn. Of the nine echinacea species, Echinacea purpurea is the most commonly used in herbal medicine. That said, some medical herbalists believe that because some other species of echinacea, namely E augustifolia and E pallida, have different qualities, we should take whichever species provides the best solution to a specific ailment. Nevertheless, according to Dr Ann Walker, senior lecturer in human nutrition at Reading University, E purpurea is an excellent all-rounder. Echinacea's roots are deeply embedded in history: well before the 19th century, the Native American Comanche tribe used it as a remedy for toothache and sore throats, while the Sioux took it to counter rabies, snake bites and septic conditions. However, in Western countries, echinacea was - and still is - most widely called upon for its immune-system-boosting qualities. It is used today to treat infections of all kinds, and is particularly helpful in combating such chronic infections as post-viral fatigue syndrome or ME, and in preventing and treating colds, flu, skin disorders and respiratory infections. Children respond particularly well to it, and it can even help to clear up stubborn, recurrent ear infections and ease allergies, particularly asthma. Dr Walker believes that this flower has a 'crucial role to play in enhancing the body's natural immune response' - in other words, it helps your body to boost its natural ability to stave off, and counter, infections and other potentially harmful conditions. Echinacea has several key constituents: alkamides, caffeic-acid esters, polysaccharides, volatile oil, echinolone and betaine among them. Numerous studies indicate that echinacea affects our white blood cells - the body's natural defence soldiers - and that T lymphocytes (T cells), macrophages and the body's natural-killer cells are particularly sensitive to it. T cells are a type of blood cell that is responsible for 'cell-mediated immunity', that is, immune mechanisms that are not controlled, or mediated, by antibodies. This type of defence mechanism is extremely important in providing us with resistance to infection by moulds like yeast (such as Candida albicans) and fungi, as well as bacteria, parasites and viruses, including herpes simplex, which can cause cold sores, the Epstein-Barr virus and those that cause hepatitis. If you are suffering from an infection by any of these organisms, it's a good indication that your cell-mediated immunity is functioning below par. Cell-mediated immunity is also critical in protecting us against the development of cancer, such auto-immune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis and allergies, and many practitioners believe that echinacea can be used to treat all of these conditions by promoting the action of neutrophil, another type of white blood cell, which engulfs and destroys bacteria, tumour cells and dead particulate matter. The most common reason people take echinacea is to ward off colds and other bugs, in other words, as a prophylactic. I find that if I load up my body with echinacea as soon as I detect the first signs of a cold, the symptoms disappear virtually straightaway. Echinacea can also help you to recover from a cold or flu more quickly and easily. In addition, practitioners have traditionally used echinacea in the prevention and treatment of cancer because of its immunity-enhancing effects. According to the Journal of Medical Chemistry in 1992, a study carried out in a laboratory situation indicated that a constituent of Echinacea pallida has anti-cancer properties. Further studies are needed to clarify whether these results can be replicated, however, and therefore whether echinacea has an important role to play in cancer treatment and prevention. Another controversial area in which more research is needed is the use of echinacea in the treatment of Aids. Scientists have questioned whether echinacea's T-cell-stimulating action may simultaneously encourage the replication of HIV, in which case the use of this flower may be counterproductive. There has also been recent controversy over whether echinacea should be used in treating auto-immune conditions, such as eczema. Although some people believe it's inadvisable to take this remedy in such cases because it may enhance an abnormal immune response, which would make the condition worse, according to Dr Walker, 'This concern is ill founded - echinacea only enhances a normal immune response.' In fact, it acts as a very useful anti-allergenic agent. Another disagreement that continues to rage is whether you should stop taking echinacea after six weeks - some herbal practitioners believe that you will nullify its overall effectiveness if you take it continually. Yet many other herbalists, including Dr Walker, prescribe its use on a long-term basis, especially for people who have seriously compromised immune systems. If you are a healthy individual who has no apparent symptoms indicating a lowered immune system, you shouldn't need to take echinacea on a continual basis, just when you're either starting to feel under the weather. The current advice is that most people should take it for eight weeks, followed by a one-week break before resuming the course. The recommended dose is usually either in the region of a 500mg capsule or tablet or to 1 teaspoon of echinacea tincture dissolved in a small amount of water, both taken three times a day. If you have a sore throat or tonsillitis, some practitioners suggest you gargle with 50ml of echinacea decoction (liquid containing echinacea extract) three times a day. (Note that although echinacea doesn't appear to be toxic when it is used as recommended, according to Andrew Chevallier's The Encyclopaedia of Medicinal Herbs, Dorling Kindersley, \u00a325, high doses can cause nausea in some people.)
