My wife and I have been seeing Steve for years and he does amazing work. Very knowledgeable and fun to talk to. The care and services available at Integrative Chiropractic are top notch! Highly recommend Dr. Palazzo! With his love of sports from playing college football and his love of anatomy and movement from his early career as an artist, Dr. Palazzo became interested in body mechanics early on in life. He considered physical therapy or chiropractic as a future career path. \"I liked that chiropractic looked at the whole body. It's a conservative, hands-on approach that involved giving people individualized care. Chiropractic was the perfect solution for helping musculoskeletal issues without using medicine or surgery.\" 9:00 am - 5:00 pm By Appointment Only 9:00 am - 5:00 pm By Appointment Only 9:00 am - 12:00 pm Closed Closed "}
