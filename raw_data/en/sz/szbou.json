Stuart Harris MD MFA Director, MGH Wilderness Medicine Fellowship Chief, MGH Division of Wilderness Medicine MGH Department of Emergency Medicine Assistant Professor of Surgery, Harvard Medical School Topics and Techniques: Wilderness medicine is defined by the practice of medicine in resource-limited, austere environments -- not exclusively by distance from human population centers. The skills taught by our Fellowship have broad and unique application: in wilderness areas, pre-hospital care, disaster medicine, international and developing-world projects, and environmental/medical policy. The MGH Wilderness Medicine Fellowship is a one year program. The critical cognitive knowledge and skills taught by our Fellowship are imparted through a range of organized didactic, research, and clinical experiences. There are five critical, longitudinal components that all fellows are mandated to complete: 1) Didactics/ Seminar: 12 curriculum modules 2) Core Clinical Experience 3) Research Skills/Topics 4) Wilderness Technical Skills. 5) Leadership Skills I. Didactics -- 12 Wilderness Medicine Fellowship Teaching Modules: Effective practice of wilderness medicine requires mastery of a large, discrete body of cognitive knowledge. The pedagogical backbone of the MGH Wilderness Medicine Fellowship Curriculum is structured through 12 primary topic modules. These modules allow fellows to master the breadth and depth of cognitive knowledge required to competently practice wilderness medicine. Each module is taught through two 90 minute, biweekly seminars conducted by WM Division staff. These meeting are open to residents, staff, and other members of the MGH EM community. Together, these modules cover in detail the critical cognitive skills and procedures that fellows are to have mastered by the completion of the fellowship. Each of these modules is comprised of required reading (from the leading text of the field, Auerbach's 2316 page, Wilderness Medicine , additional monographs, key articles from the medical literature, and reading selections from world literature). The seminar format allows fellows opportunity for discussion and synthesis of these ideas. For many of these modules, there is an associated field, experiential education, or research experience that accompanies. Additionally, Grand Rounds guest lectures augment our wilderness medicine fellowship teaching. These speakers are of international authority, and their lectures are open not only to fellows and the entire HAEMR residency, but to the entire MGH community. Prior speakers have been welcomed as part of MGH EM/ IM grand rounds, and are available for meals, career planning, and research discussions in the days before and after speaking. We anticipate continuing this tradition. Module 1 Wilderness, Global Health, Good Books, and Physicians Reading: see attached appendix B, \"Wilderness, Global Health, Good Books, and Physicians.\" The Practice of the Wild: Essays . Gary Snyder. Sand County Almanac . Aldo Leopold. The Wilderness Act of 1964 ( Pub.L. 88-577) Additionally, fellows may choose any two texts from the attached bibliography. In preparation for teaching the attached course overview, fellows must complete the required reading and read at least two additional books noted in the bibliography. During this seminar, fellows will be responsible for helping discuss each of the works noted. In so doing, they should be able to trace the intellectual evolution of 'wilderness' and human culture's interaction with the nature world through the lens of both science/policy and of literature. As described in the handout, I intend this module: 1) To expose the fellow to the wide range of literature that investigates mankind's relationship with the natural world. 2) To help facilitate a conversation about the role and responsibility of the modern physician and organized medicine in re spect to 'environmental' issues. 3) To engender a sense of awareness about the important role that practicing physicians can play in advocating for local and global environmental issues.

Clinical Experience A firm clinical grounding in the practice of emergency medicine is foremost in the skill set of an effective wilderness medicine practitioner. This is provided through the completion of an emergency medicine residency and by ongoing, active practice in a busy ED. A critical component of post-graduate education is the opportunity to practice in a setting where more experienced practitioners are immediately available for consultation and case review. Wilderness medicine fellows will practice no more than 16 hours/ week in the MGH ED, where at least one and as many as 5 seasoned clinicians are simultaneously involved in direct patient care (staffing requirements established by time of day). Our experience shows that this independent practice of patie nt care in a carefully mentored environment allows rapid further advance of young clinicians, while encouraging the independence required for effective wilderness medical care. To develop critical experience in austere settings, our fellows are expected to spend at least three months of their year actively participating in wilderness/ developing world clinical care. CORE CLINCAL EXPERIENCES: Our clinical curriculum is established around three 'core' experiences. The approximate length of each experience is provided parenthetically. 1. Everest Base Camp Region of Nepal. (3 months) 2. U.S. Army Research Institute for Environmental Medicine (Natick, MA and Pikes Peak Summit Lab, CO). (1-2 weeks) 3. A Marine/Hyperbaric Clinical Experience as described in Appendix A. (1 week) Core Clinical Experiences are underwritten by a Continuing Medical Education Stipend. 1 Everest Base Camp Region of Nepal The 'core' component of our wilderness clinical experience is in the Everest Base Camp region of Nepal with the Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA). Each of our first three fellows has engaged in a 3 month clinical experience with the HRA's clinic in Pheriche, Nepal. This HRA clinic was established in the 1970's and provides a critical medical resource for both local and trekking/climbing populations in the austere Khumbu Valley of Nepal. It is at the base of Mt. Everest, and so while accessible only by days of walking and in an austere environment, has a continuous stream of both western trekkers and local porters and local villagers as patients. This clinical population offers experience in a range of important conditions, from acute mountain sickness and HAPE, to blunt trauma, to infectious diarrhea, to labor and delivery. Fellows are accompanied and directly under the supervision of Board Certified physicians throughout their stay. Our fellowship has a long association with the leadership of the HRA, which has continued to offer an outstanding clinical experience for our fellows. The HRA clinic continues to be the site of groundbreaking high altitude research and the site of productive research by our prior fellows. The strengths of the HRA's Pheriche clinic experience include: 1) high altitude, 2) austere setting, 3) traumatic, medical, obstetric, and emergency medical cases that routinely present, 4) the continuous oversight of faculty, 5) our stable relationship with this organization over decades, and 6) my past personal clinical experience at this site which provides good insight into the quality of supervision, the richness of the patient population, and how to maximize the learning experience and minimize obstructions for the fellow. Given the extraordinary resources this site offers, we intend for this experience to continue to offer the primary site of our clinical experience in the years to come. 2 U.S. Army Research Institute for Environmental Medicine (Natick, MA and Pikes Peak Summit Lab, CO) A second required 'core' clinical component of our fellowship takes advantage of our warm collegial relationship with the U.S. Army Research Institute for Environmental Medicine (USARIEM). Based in Natick, Mass, USARIEM is the national center for environmental medicine for the U.S. Armed Forces. We have a multi-year experience, both clinical and research, working with the USARIEM team. We have current, multi-year funding for research ongoing between our organizations. Given their immediate proximity to Boston, the fellow is offered frequent interactions with the advanced expertise of the USARIEM team on multiple protocols. Prior fellows have gained critical clinical exposure as they have assisted in the care of research subjects and research scientists during ongoing studies in Natick hypobaric chamber and Pikes Peak Labs in Colorado. Time at USARIEM is typically spent on a day to day basis as hypobaric protocols are being run (e.g. 7A-4 P on Mondays and Thursdays when subjects are being exposed to hypobaric conditions). This experience will continue to be central to our fellow's educational experience. 3 Marine/ Hyperbaric Clinical Experience The last required 'core' clinical component is a marine and hyperbaric medicine component. This experience and expectation is fully described in Appendix A. Additional Elective Experiences: Additionally, prior fellows have also engaged in leadership/ field medical staff position opportunities with: Primal Quest - caring for racing and support staff Explorers' Club - caring for expedition members on international journeys. Gokyo Porters' Clinic (Khumbu, Nepal) Denali high altitude backcountry patrols (U.S. Park Service) National Outdoor Leadership School/ Wilderness Medicine Institute (Alaska, Wyoming, Baja, Patagonia). On each of these other experiences, the fellow is offered advanced preparation prior to departure, a proctored field experience by staff, and a detailed post-experience debrief to allow for maximal oversight and learning. Collegial Cross Pollination with other U.S. Wilderness Medicine Fellowships: The fellowship directors of the four current Wilderness Medicine Fellowships (Stanford, University of Utah, University of California, San Francisco/ Fresno, and our own) are in frequent contact. We share a common believe that our combined strengths are greater than our isolated programs and we encourage collegial interactions for all of our fellows to maximize their learning experiences. Early collaborations include those of Stanford's fellow with our own in clinical and research opportunities in Nepal. We look forward to developing other opportunities. We also seek to further domestic collaborations so that fellows may take advantage of local austere environments unique to other programs. III. Longitudinal Core, Required Components: There are three additional critical, longitudinal components that all fellows are mandated to complete: 1. Research Skills/Topics 2. Wilderness Technical Skills 3. Leadership/ Teaching Skills Each of these topics is critical to the fellowship year - and will remain so for the rest of a career. They are taught using seminar, field experience, and experiential education. 1. Research Skills/Topics Required reading: An Introduction to Medical Statistics . 3 rd Edition. J. Martin Bland, Oxford University Press, 2000. Additional Reading: Accompanying Appendi x C, \"Wilderness Medicine Research Seminar.\" It is expected that all Wilderness Medicine Fellows will actively pursue research as a key focus of their fellowship. The Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Emergency Medicine supports each fellow with a research stipend to help advance scholarly projects. The goal of this component is to teach and review topics and skills required for a successful research career. Rather than a listing of individual, important skills, we teach research skills as a narrative process. While individual scientific papers are might appear as isolated objects, each is the product of a human narrative -- from first inklings of an idea to explore, to a final published work. Specific, statistical and other tools are part of the narrative. These research skills will be taught by acquiring cognitive skills through reading of Dr. Bland's text, discussion, and through experiential education. Topics: 1. Finding your niche/ topic in Wilderness Medicine a) Establish what early interests you want to pursue. b) Establishing a rough hypothesis c) Pub Med/ appropriate text/ established expert review to find out what's been previously done d) Refining your hypothesis 2. Research Planning a) Mechanics and considerations for field-based research b) Environmental exposure limitations on devices, means of gathering and storing data c) Site selection for enrolling subjects (pre-established cohort vs. field enrollment). d) Potential means to maximize ease of enrollment (site, affiliations, inducements) e) Funding considerations -- most importantly if it needed. If so, who might be approached? Institutional, government and NGO sources. f) Constructing a budget, establishing time/ travel/ equipment requirements g) Safe, secure storage options for field data storage, back-up options 3. Statistics a) Guided by discussion and utilization of Dr. Bland's text. b) Adequately powering your studies c) Maximizing statistical tools to hypothesis being tested. d) Analysis of data 4. IRB's Navigation a) Understanding the role of IRB's b) Expedited vs. full review considerations c) Anticipating and avoiding problems d) Writing IRB application to minimal need for revision. e) How to answer concerns/ revision requests. f) Organization - establishing systems to track multiple concurrent IRB applications/ renewals/ amendments 5. Measurement forms/ field devices a) Matching form to data to be gathered (e.g. differenced between data forms (simple nominal vs. categorical data), Visual analogue scales vs. ultrasound images, paper vs. electronic format (iPaq) 6. Analysis of data a) Matching the right statistical test to the data. b) Leading statistical programs. c) Statistical resources at MGH, HMS. 7. Choosing prospective journals for submission. a) Review journals - match your study's form, content, breadth to journal. 8. Writing paper. a) Energy of activation is overcome by simple sitting down and starting. This it the critical point at which many studies (with data fully gathered and analyzed, become still-born.) b) Thoughts to manuscript construction 9. Responding to peer- reviewers a) Recognizing 'good' vs. 'bad' editorial suggestions b) Deciding which editorial suggestions to adopt: what's best for the work. c) Employing the art of diplomacy in editorial interaction Research Opportunities: There are numerous research opportunities within the department as well as with faculty throughout the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University. Research Activities are underwritten by a Research Stipend. Current, active collaborations include projects with: MGH Divisions of Cardiology, Pulmonary and Critical Care, and Surgery. Research investigators at the US Army Research Institute for Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) (Natick, MA and Pikes Peak Lab). Investigators with the Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA) (We have pursued a number of different research projects with the HRA over the last decade). Faculty of Harvard Medical School. Investigators with the joint MIT/Harvard Medical School venture, the Center for Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technology (CIMIT). WMI/NOLS on educational outcomes for wilderness medicine courses. Our research has been supported by grant funding through the MGH, HMS, CIMIT, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the National Institutes of Health. Regular and direct contact with the Fellowship Director allows planning and oversight of fellow's individual research projects. Additionally, MGH is the home of the International HAPE Registry. Dr. Harris is Registry Master and Chair of the Steering Committee. To date, faculty and fellows have published their research on a range of topics including: the first description of ultrasound to diagnose HAPE; the treatment of HAPE at high altitude; correlation of optic nerve sheath diameter with symptoms of acute mountain sickness and in cases of HAPE; efficacy trials for high altitude headache analgesia; response of the right ventricle and pulmonary vascular pressure in response to acute hypoxia; and case reports on rabid fox attack and acute arterial thrombus requiring loss of limb. Fellows are encouraged to pursue their specific interests in developing research projects that will be rewarding in the immediate term, and that will prepare them for a career as a leader in wilderness medicine. 4. Wilderness Technical Skills. Wilderness medicine is defined as the practice of medicine in resource limited, austere environments . Safely practicing medicine under austere conditions requires a discrete and teachable body of expertise - not limited to skills of keeping you and your patients physically comfortable in any of a range of demanding climates; the ability to safely acquire food, water, and dispose of human waste in any of a variety of biomes; and technical wilderness travel skills including nav igation and safe travel in environments not limited to those involving the hazards of high altitude, high angles, moving water, and extremes of temperature. These skills are taught through seminar and by direct field experience under direct supervision. 1.

Khumbu Valley, Nepal) e) mountain Biking (Blue Hills, Canyonlands, UT) f) sea Kayaking (Boston Harbor Islands, Acadian NP, ME.) 5. Leadership/ Teaching Skills Reading: The Leadership Educator Notebook , National Outdoor Leadership School, Edited by: John Gookin and Shari Leach. 2009 edition. The Wilderness Educator Notebook , 10 th Edition, National Outdoor Leadership School, Edited by: John Gookin. 2006. The successful practice of wilderness medicine is advanced by the study and practice of expedition and leadership practice and theory. The practice of wilderness medicine is inevitably a team exercise under trying ci rcumstances. The ability to effectively anticipate common expedition logistics, to appreciate different learning and leadership styles, and to organize and effect group dynamics to effect a unified end (whether in travel, search and rescue, or clinical care) are critical skills - and ones with direct application to 'front-country' medical endeavors. This longitudinal educational experience is taught through reading, discussion, and field experiential education. 1. Recognizing Different Learning Styles a) Visual, Kinesthetic, Aural, Narrative/ Associative b) Educational Techniques: Lecture, Problem-Based Learning, Case- Based Learning, Seminar, Small Groups, Field Experience 2. Teaching in the Field a) Visual presentation options b) Key points of ideal 'classroom' selection c) When to teach: weather, time of day, goals for days travel, topography d) Best use of 'teachable moments on the trail/river 3. Leadership Skills a) Pre-treat Planning b) Group Dynamics c) Setting Realistic Personal and Group Goals d) Expedition Behavior e) Lessons in Effective Feedback f) Leadership Styles These skills are assessed in application: with HAEMR residents and with NOLS/WMI students by Division of WM staff. Constructive, timely feedback is given. Fellows' Teaching Opportunities: Classroom-based education : Fellows have regular teaching responsibilities with the Harvard Affiliated Emergency Medicine residents and Harvard Medical School students at MGH. Field-based Education : Fellows are provided opportunity for teaching time in the field with the Wilderness Medicine Institute of the National Outdoor Leadership School (WMI/NOLS). Dr. Harris serves as Medical Director, Curriculum Writer, and Supervising and Field Faculty for this month-long, senior medical student course (Medicine in the Wild) taught with NOLS/WMI in the Gila Wilderness, NM. Additional opportunities for leadership/ teaching with NOLS/WMI for physician level CME are currently being developed (Wind River Range Expedition for Physicians). Specific Goals and Objectives for Fellow: The MGH Wilderness Medicine Fellowship is a one year program designed to give graduates of emergency medicine residency programs the skills and knowledge to become leaders in the field of wilderness medicine. The goals of our fellowship program include: 1) Providing a one year clinical and wilderness experience, at the completion of which, fellowship graduates should be prepared to lead or provide expert wilderness medical care anywhere on the globe. 2) Pursuing intellectually-rigorous research to advance the state of knowledge in wilderness medicine and publish these results. 3) Providing opportunity for extended field experience in the practice of wilderness medicine. 4) Providing experience teaching wilderness m edicine to students, residents, and staff - both in the classroom and in wilderness settings. 5) Providing opportunity for the fellow to learn/ develop advanced outdoor technical skills (whether ice/rock/alpine climbing, whitewater or sea boating, etc). 6) Providing access to medical experiences in the developing world (remembering that wilderness medicine is defined by the practice of medicine in resource-limited environments - not exclusively by di stance from human population centers). 7) Encouraging exploration of environmental policy issues as they impact human health and well-being. 8) Providing access to the breadth of Harvar d University with ongoing collaborations with faculty at the Medical School and School of Public Health. 9) Providing an ongoing, clinical emergency medicine experience in a Level I trauma center in a busy urban ED. Wilderness Medicine Fellow's Weekly Schedule Our fellows will be expected to work the same days/ evenings/ nights/ weekends that other MGH fellows and attending staff do. For the fellow, this will only be 16 hours/ week - so two separate 8 hour shifts. Beyond this, their schedule will include: 2 hours/week for teaching /discussion of assigned reading, 10-15 hours week for research, 4 hours for reading, 3 hours for administrative tasks, 1-2 hours week teaching of residents and medical students, 1 hour meeting with fellowship staff. In total, approximately 36-42 hours/week for purely fellowship related activities. While the schedule of emergency physicians is typically varied, a potential representative schedule is below: Monday: 9:00 -17:00, clinical shift in Fast Track, MGH ED Tuesday: 8:00-10:00am, administration. 10:00am-noon, didactics with fellowship staff. Emergency Medicine Rounds. Wednesday: 8:00-9:00am, resident teaching (MGH) 9:00-16:00, research (e.g. IRB submission, data analysis). Thursday: 7:00-16:00, research (e.g. site visit to USARIEM Hypobaric Chamber). Friday: 9:00am-noon, reading A: \"Advanced Training in Marine and Hyperbaric Medicine.\" Our fellows are expected to develop expertise in the critical components of marine medicine. We accomplish this by a combinat ion of reading, formal didactics, clinical experience with marine and hyperbaric cases, and offer exposure to marine research topics. Our fellow's clinical experience is grounded in the long-standing relationship between the MGH ED and the MEEI's Knight Hyperbaric facility. The Knight Hyperbaric facility is staffed in part by MGH Emergency Medicine fa culty. Our wilderness fellows have first hand access to following cases treated in the chambers by working with fellowship faculty on call. Additionally, the fellowship offers advanced hyperbaric training through National Baromedical Services, t he largest training course for introductory and advanced training in baromedicine in the U.S. This five day course is the leading source of advanced training in medical hyperbarics, and is the same course that MEEI/ MGH staff members undergo to further their expertise in hyperbaric treatment. The cost of the course is covered by the fellowship. This training prepares the fellow to act as a local resource for marine and hyperbaric medicine topics in the future. During this five day experience, entitled, Primary Hype rbaric Training , our fellows cover the following topics: 1. Physical Aspects of Hyperbaric Medicine The clini cal utilization of alterations in atmospheric pressure dictate that the practitioner comprehend both the beneficial and potentially hazardous aspects of this esoteric environment. Applicable gas laws and their role in hyperbaric medicine will be reviewed. 2. Mechanisms of Action Under increased atmosphere pressure, oxygen becomes a potent and dose dependent drug. Six beneficial effects have been identified: hyperoxygenation, vasoconstriction, superoxide radical formation, pressure/vol ume related effects, neovascularization and antagonism of leukocyte induced reperfusion injury. The scientific elucidation of these mechanisms and their clinical relevance are discussed. 3. Patient Care Special emphasis will be placed upon the preparation of the patient for hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The typical emergent referral involves a patient who is intubated, ventilator dependent, with peripheral and central vascular access lines and the possibility of a chest tube. Each of these aspects, as they relate to relative patient isolation and alterations in atmospheric pressure, will be discussed and practiced. Risk factors for hyperbaric oxygen exposure will be clarified and the management of patient complications reviewed in detail. 4. Oxygen Toxicity As a gaseou s drug, large doses of oxygen can produce undesirable side effects and drug interactions. The central nervous system and lungs are two most commonly effected organs and their response to hyperbaric oxygen will be reviewed in depth. Special emphasis will be placed on the recognition and management of CNS oxygen toxicity. 5. Monoplace Chamber Operations Through a cohesive series of clinical training sessions, the prospective hyperbaric team member will learn and participate in all as pects of the monoplace hyperbaric chamber delivery system. Standard operational protocols will be augmented with ancillary equipment demonstrations and a detailed review of emergency procedures. 6. Contraindications and Side Effects Pre-exposure evaluation of risk fa ctors centers on the prevention of pulmonary barotrauma of ascent and the development of a central nervous system oxygen intolerance secondary to high inspired oxygen pressures. The risk-benefit ratio will be discussed, and in the context of the full range of patient states. 7. Non-pulmonary Barotrauma Boyle's law dictates that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure exerted upon it. Specifically, the clinical ramifica tions of this simple principle as it relates to gas bearing anatomy will be discussed. The effects of pressure changes in the middle ear will be examined in detail, and the technical considerations of needle myringotomy will be detailed. 8. Carbon Monoxide Poisoning/Smoke Inhalation - cyanide poisoning Carbon monoxide is the most common cause of poisoning in the U.S. In its subtle form the diagnosis is easily missed. A new appreciation for the phenomenon of clinical relapse following conventional oxygen therapy and the potential for long term sequelae has reshaped our understanding of this toxic gas. Current concepts in the pathophysiology of the disease are explored and will include the role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in pregnancy. 9. Decompression Sickness This occu pational disease of divers, aviators and tunnel workers is no longer limited in presentation to coastal regions and military institutions. Decompression sickness can result from exposure to any body of water deeper than 30 feet. With more divers flying to and from their dive sites, the potential for illness must be considered, regardless of geographic location. Differential diagnosis, on-site management, evacuation protocols and definitive therapy will be discussed, as will the capabilities of the monoplace chamber. 10. Cerebral Arterial Gas Embolism A major life-threatening event, cerebral arterial gas embolization can occur during decompression (in divers and aviators), traumatically in penetrating chest injuries and, most commonly, in the clinical setting sec ondary to invasive diagnostic, monitoring, or therapeutic procedures. Presentation, differential diagnosis and management guidelines will be reviewed. 11. Crush Injuries/Compartment Syndrome - other acute ische mias In an earlier report, it was found that when hyperbaric oxygen therapy was used to arrest the progression of a skeletal compartment syndrome, the cost of management was one-fourth that of surgically treated compartment syndromes. While not proposed in severe cases, the use of HBO in compartment syndrome in selected cases is based on its ability to down-regulate leukocyte receptor sites, decrease tissue edema, hyperoxygenate tissue and overcome diffusion barriers. Evidence for its role in the management of crush injuries is reviewed in detail. 12. Gas Gangrene - necrotizing soft tissue infections (clostridial and nonclostridial) Anaerobic infections are among the most challenging infectious disease problems. Optimum management in many instances mandates a combined therapeutic regimen using antibiotics and surgery in combination with hyperbaric oxygen. There is a growing body of evidence to indicate that HBO provides a number of benefits, which include detoxification of the patient, enhanced white cell activity, a synergistic enhancement of selected antibiotics, and improved wound healing. 13. Acute Thermal Burns The therapy of burns is directed a minimizing edema, preserving marginally viable tissue, enhancing host defenses and promoting wound closure. Adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen can attack all of these problems directly through a combination of mechanisms. Basic research, controlled clinical studies and cost impact will be reviewed. 14. Radiation Tissue Damage It was the consensus of the 1990 National Cancer Institute Conference on Oral Complications of Cancer Therapies that HBO is a standard of care, in conjunction with surgery as indicated, for osteoradionecrosis of the mandible. Further, HBO was recommended in a prophylactic capacity prior to surgical procedures within the irradiated field, in high risk patients. Evidence of a benefit of HBO in soft tissue radiation injury will be included during this presentation. 15. Case Presentations Interesting clinica l problems and case illustrations will be presented. Cases have been selected which will emphasize key management principles. Field Marine Experiences -- Prior fellows have taken advantage of excellent diving medicine courses and dive training through the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine Society and the Wilderness Medicine Society. These courses offer professional training in SCUBA techniques and marine environmental awareness. They cover to pics from diving protocols and safety, to marine envenomations, marine trauma, hyperbaric medicine, and unique marine infectious disease considerations. Additionally, through our decade's long relationship with the National Outdoor Leadership School and Wilderness Medical Institute, we offer access to the wide range of their marine and marine medicine courses: spanning from the icy waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska to the tropical marine environments of the western coast of Baja, Mexico. Additional experiences in Patagonia are also offered. We have well-established contacts with the U.S. Navy's Seal Training Team (Hawaii) and marine scientific research opportunities through Hawaii Pacific University's Dr. Brenda Jenssen. Lastly, we continue to develop our contacts and collaborative relationships with the MIT/ Woods Hole teams, and would encourage our fellows to take advantage of this rich resource in our immediate locale. Appendix B: \"Wilderness, Global Health, Good Books, and Physicians.\" Wilderness, Global Health, Good Books, and Physicians N. Stuart Harris MFA MD FACEP Chief, Division of Wilderness Medicine Dept of Emergency Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital Welcome to the course. Writing at 4:11 AM on a bizarrely quiet overnight shift in Boston, I look forward to our meeting in a warmer, less fluorescently-lit April - some three weeks after you've headed into the Gila wilderness. Where now, you are (I'd like to think) clean, individual medical students scattered across N. America - and suddenly wondering what there is to learn about \"Wilderness, Global Health, Good Books, and Physicians\" -- when we meet in April, none of this will be true. Instead, you'll be a well-acquainted team, and have practical medical knowledge of approaches to wilderness emergencies readily in mind. You will no longer be clean -- but it is my hope, that you will have some growing sense of the role of the physician in wilderness and global health. The focus of your course will be learning wilderness medicine. The majority of this will be taught in the field, with hands on scenarios. A basic and critical component will start before you head into the wilderness and will consist of reading a book of your choosing on wilderness ethics/ history/ literature. As a basic expectation of the course, I expect you to become familiar with a range of literature that examines mankind and our environmental. (The same way a 20 th C lit course student would be expected to be familiar with the basics of Faulkner, Hemingway, F. Scott Fitz, etc). I intend this project : 1) To expose the members of the course to the wide range of literature that investigates mankind's relationship with the natural world. 2) To help facilitate a conversation about the role and responsibility of the modern physician and organized medicine in re spect to 'environmental' issues. 3) To engender a sense of awareness about the important role that practicing physicians can play in advocating for local and global environmental issues. This process starts with your reading this (exceedingly long) letter. It will be ongoing during your time in the field into April. Through it, I hope you will discover some sense of the role and reach of wilderness and global health as it impacts your chosen career. I intend it to be facilitated by senior EM resident, Dr. Goldflam, and your NOLS/WMI instructors (The Esteemed Mr. John Hovey Esq.), and later myself -- but to be self-guided and self-motivated if it is to be worth a damn. For most med students, this is an aberration - we become very good at devouring and regurgitating vast amounts of data for our regular tests (gross, histo, surg and IM clerkships, Steps I, II, III, and then Speciality Board Certification, 10 y. recert, etc) - but only rarely as I see it, are we given the opportunity to stand up from a desk, look around, and to come to some intellectual and spiritual end by our own lights. From w hat I've heard from last year's course members, if this course doesn't accomplish some nurturing of an independent and ongoing intellectual adventure on this topic, I'll be surprised. Any NOLS course can have a life-transforming influence - that may not be your intent in signing up, and it might not seem like it on the course itself, but more often than not, it turns out to be true. Like all NOLS courses, Medicine in the Wild will demand a great deal of your flexibility, good humor, and physical endurance - but in addition to the practical medical knowledge this course imparts, I intend this process to offer a social/ spiritual/ intellectual challenge I frankly see as the more long lasting and potentially transformative influence. You have chosen a profession where at some point soon, you'll be working as a resident in a tertiary care center ICU, surrounded by patients on ventilators and pressors - and the wilderness will seem a very long way away. Your med school debt will still be compounding. In this setting, it would seem the import of wilderness and global health awareness would be very limited. I hope to extend to you some sense of why for physicians, especially in this setting, some larger sense of the physicians' mission is enriched by having an appreciation of the effect that wilderness and global health has on each of us as individuals. Books and a month in the wilderness are the tools to help achieve this goal. 'So who the heck is this guy?' you're likely asking. I'll leave that to Dr. Goldflam to hint at and for you to decide when 'the clean guy' walks in to meet you in the Gila Wilderness. In brief, though, I'll be approaching this project from the point of view of an academic emergency physician, a former NOLS student, a former NOLS instructor, a graduate of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, father, and long-time whitewater boater/ sea kayaker/mountaineer. It is your responsibility to: 1. Choose any one of the texts noted below - (or any text you can convince me to approve PRE-course). 2. Closely read the text PRIOR TO ARRIVAL IN TUCSON. 3. Either PRIOR TO (by email) or on the FIRST DAY OF THE COURSE (as you show up in Tucson) hand in to Mr. John Hovey Esq, a two page (400 word) overview in which you tell me what you found most interesting about your book. I'll read them. In these, you can investigate the author's thesis, the methods they've used to establish their points or articulating any questions or issues the text has raised in your mind to date. Whatever you think is interesting in it, is what I'm interested in hearing from you. After this first day, until a couple of weeks into the course, you are encouraged to pack your book in with the re- ration supplies. This way, you need not carry it until you need it in the second half of the course (before #4 below). For the next few weeks, pay attention to the wilderness around you. A number of prior students have said, \"I had no idea what this book was about, until I had the chance to live outside for two weeks, and then it made perfect sense.\" (This es pecially so from the Gary Snyder readings). 4. On the final day in the field, you will be given 10 minutes to share what you found most compelling in your book with your course mates and me. A brief summary can be great, as can reading quotations from your text that you found funny/interesting/thought-provoking -- or that you vehemently disagree with. You should try to place the book in some context (vis-\u00e0-vis place/human history/natural history/geography/politics/etc) or describe how it might relate to current global/environmental health issues. Adding a fourth to Jefferson's three truths, that there will be active group participation is self evident. 5. As you travel through the Gila, enjoy the dirt, sky, and your colleagues. As you get a chance, consider with your course mates what role MD's should play in advocating for local and global environmental health issues. Reading List: (on a first come basis) Sand County Almanac - Aldo Leopold - A central work in the founding of environmental awareness and studies. Beautiful, lucid, fun to read prose. Silent Spring - Rachael Carson - well-written, seminal book that in many ways ignited the modern environmental movement. Not a good read if you love DDT or hate bald eagles. NOLS Wilderness Ethics: Valuing and Managing Wild Places - A broad survey, with lots of good idea/good teaching points/good readings. (I get no cut in suggesting this). The Big Necessary - Rose George - An interesting examination of how western countries deal with - and don't deal with -- their poop. After reading this, you'll begin to wonder why we chose to sully the 95% of sewage that is minimally-dirty 'grey water' with the 5% of what Rose nicely calls 'shit.' This is a good question. A bit British for my taste, but I'm sure she's working to overcome this. By any other name, I'm sure she'd smell as sweet . . . Omnivore's Dilemma - Michael Pollan - A fascinating, well-written investigation of three potential meals, roughly broken down into \"industrial food, organic or alternative food, and food we forage ourselves.\" For most of us, it is an eye-opening look at how ubiquitous 'industrial' food production has become - which isn't romantic, and more importantly, doesn't lead to good public policy, good health policy, or good food. Desert Solitaire - Edward Abbey - For those not familiar with him, Abbey is a funny, somewhat prickly iconoclast, who is generally either loved or hated. This is his story of a couple of seasons as a backcountry ranger in the undeveloped Arches National Park in the early 60's. The Monkey Wrench Gang - Edward Abbey - See above. Some would now label him an 'eco-terrorist' (if a funny, articulate, and rarely sober one) after reading about his adventures in the name of wilderness preservation. Encounters with the Archdruid - John McPhee -- McPhee is one of the leading essayist/nonfiction writers of the last 40 years. This book describes three trips in backcountry settings - each one featuring former Sierra Club director, and then founder of Friend of the Earth, David Brower - but each with three different 'opponents' (the developers of mines, resorts and dams) along on the backcountry trip. Cadillac Desert - Marc Reisner - A great narrative on the battle between individuals and cities to control the single most important natural resource that defines where and how people live in the Western US - water. Be forewarned, LA and Las Vegas take a bit of a beating. Let the Mountains Talk, Let the Rivers Run - David Bower - See Brower's hx above. Essays. The Practice of the Wild: Essays . Gary Snyder. Snyder was present at the founding of the 'Beat' poetry movement, and has spent his life as a poet, translator, environmental scholar and intellectual. His prose is lucid, extends to include science and Shamanism, Native American/Eastern/Western philosophy. A better choice for those intellectually free-wheeling enough to strike off towards territories a bit removed from the standard scientific text. A Place in Space: Ethics, Aesthetics, and Watersheds . (essays) Gary Snyder - Again, lucid, well-written, but intellectually vigorous essays. A personal recommendation. For those of more of a fiction/poetry bent - I'd encourage any of a huge range of great books that address the interplay between character and environment. Potential choices: Moby Dick . Melville -- One of those novels that everyone knows, but that we could all re- read and get something useful from it. I had an entire semester class on this novel alone in graduate school. Nominally the tale of Ishmael on this whaling ship, the Pequod , it remains a central text on the place of the individual within the environment. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . Twain - We've all read it - and as will gain from an adult re-reading. Mountains and Rivers Without End and Danger on Peaks (Poems) Gary Snyder - Snyder's poetry might be compared with Frost's. It is deceptively simple appearing, tending to use natural imagery and metaphor, and is both memorable and powerful for this very reason. \"The Bear Hunt\" from Go Down Moses . Faulkner - this is a novella, within the collection of short stories that is GDM . It tells the story of a young man's hunt for a bear, and the changes to people and land over years that occur in this portion of Mississippi in the early 20th C. Blood Meridian or The Road - Cormac McCarthy - Be forewarned, McCarthy is hugely violent - but his prose is as magnificent as that of any living writer today. If he doesn't win the Nobel, I'll be disappointed. Blood Meridian is set in the 19th C desert Southwest (not unlike where you'll be going shortly), and follows 'the kid' throughout this landscape. The Road is his latest, and is the story of a father and son's journey in a post-apocalyptic world. Importantly, books are chosen on a first come basis, one per student. All are readily available (many in good quality, used editions from Amazon for $5-15. You'll be carrying the book for 20+ days on your back. I'd make it a point NOT to get a hardback. I'll follow this with a quick detailing of a research project overview that we'll pursue in seminar form under the tall trees. Be in touch by email quickly to establish choices. And please be in touch with any questions. I look forward to meeting you in the desert. Stuart Appendix C: \"Wilderness Medicine Research Seminar .\" How to Do Wilderness (or other) Medical Research. N. Stuart Harris MFA MD FACEP Chief, Division of Wilderness Medicine Dept of Emergency Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital I've been repeatedly asked by students on previous courses to talk about how to do research - and especially, how to do Wilderness Medicine research. As a means of helping you to achieve this end, I've attached a paper we published a couple of years back. I ask you to read it. I intend this only as a means of helping each of you to consider how you might successfu lly pursue research - both as residents and in your staff careers to follow. I suggest this only as the way to do things, but more as a template for discussing how a very simple research project progresses from idea (in this case, while standing in line for coffee) to published work. Whatever research experience you may have, or might be interested in pursuing, this would be a great forum to help yourselves and others. Nearly universal steps we will talk about include: Investigating early interests - what do you find yourself doing in your free time? Generating a rough hypothesis Getting to know the field: Search of Pub Med, appropriate texts to find out what's been previously done. Collaborators - who's smart, enthusiastic, is willing to help, and has time? Refine hypothesis. Consider funding - most importantly, is it even needed? If so, who might be approached for funding? Writing up a budget, figuring time/ travel/ equipment. Logistics: who needs to do what, when, and where? IRB's - they don't exist just to cause pain - though this is usually 95% of their product. Data Collection: forms, devices, ease and security of storage. Field Time! Gathering data. Pursuing subjects: Is it unethical to dig pits to trap prospective subjects?? Analysis of data: finding a smart, PhD in statistics. Choosing prospective journals for submission. Writing paper. Responding to peer- reviewers - the art of diplomacy. Work is published! Start process again. Read our paper, and tuck it into a zip lock for the field. Again, if you've published anything, please forward to me so I can incorporate it as well. Unlike your book, this should come with you in the field, and should be re-read in the days before I show up to meet you after the second re-ration, and it will help us structure a 2 hour seminar under the tall, quiet conifers above the Gila Cli ff Dwellings. Any research experiences you can bring to our discussion will be much appreciated. "}
