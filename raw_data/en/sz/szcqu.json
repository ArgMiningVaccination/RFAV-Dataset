We are happy you are here and hope you have a wonderful and meaningful time here at Plowshare Far m. The healthy social life is found When in the mirror of each human being The whole community finds its reflection, And when in the community The virtue of each one is living. (Rudolf Steiner: Motto of social ethics) Volunteer Handbook 2013 - 14 edition This handbook is intended to help guide you into th e life and work of this community. The handbook will help you through the f irst few weeks and the whole year, so please keep it where you can easily find i t and refer to it. Page 2 of 10 OUR VALUES At Plowshare Farm we strive to manifest what are ca lled the three essentials of Camphill (Camphills ar e the Anthroposophically-based lifesharing communitie s on which Plowshare Farm is founded). These can be formulated differently, but here is one simple t riad. The first essential is our striving always to recognize and respect the higher being or divine es sence of every individual, regardless of outer appearance or abilities. The second is that many of us follow a conscious inner path of self-developme nt integrated with our outer work. The third is the cr eation of community social structures that reflect and foster genuine brotherhood. OUR IDEALS We engage in biodynamic agriculture (a philosophy o f organic agriculture), in crafts using natural materials, homemaking with an emphasis on orderly w armth and sharing of tasks, cooking with healthful ingredients in an atmosphere of encouragement and s kill development, etc. The time we spend together when we are not working reflects the same ideals: w e choose activities that engage the whole person an d encourage the direct participation of our senses in the natural world . Playing music and listening to live performances are much loved cultural activities tha t involve our healthy senses. Hiking, games, contin ued learning or conversation are encouraged. You will n otice, for instance, that television, a passive act ivity, is not a part of our daily lives. Television, recor ded music and electronic sound, do not originate fr om a living source, and are therefore not alive in the m oment they are experienced. In our workplaces, we discourage background music or radio, which distrac ts us from focusing on living the experience fully . WHO'S WHO Householders and workshop leaders: Erin Barber ( Therapeutic Farmer) Kay Kinderman (Red House) Joel Park (Artaban House) Molly Park (Artaban House) Jim Lang (Hestia House) Jennifer Locke (Jovis House) Shawn Grider (Jovis House) Kimberly Dorn (Jovis House) Bay (Jovis Lunch Workshop Leader: Laurie Schwabe ANTHROPOSOPHY and SPIRITUAL LIFE Anthroposophy arose in Germanic Europe in the first part of the 20 th century guided by Austrian philosopher, Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). Steiner r ecognized the need of our times to re-unite super sensible realities with our experience in the mater ial world. To that end, he chose a rigorous educati on in modern science and philosophy, and developed Anthro posophy, which can be defined as \"spiritual science\" or simply \"wisdom of the human being.\" St einer described it as \"a path of knowledge leading the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual i n the universe.\" He shared the results of his spiri tual research in over 6,000 lectures and 40 books. Anthr oposophy is a spiritual view of the human being and the cosmos, but emphasizes knowing, rather than fai th. Rudolf Steiner's wealth of insights offers a pa th Page 3 of 10 for conscious spiritual self-development and at the same time inspires countless practical initiatives in education, science, agriculture, the arts, social a nd economic realms, medicine and curative work. Our work is inspired by Anthroposophy. On the Anthr oposophical path, one learns to meet every man or woman as an eternal spiritual being living in a par ticular configuration of soul and body. Rudolf Steiner's insights of Anthroposophy have rea ched many parts of the world. Since his death, othe rs have carried on with his work, creating movements s uch as Waldorf education, biodynamic agriculture, eurythmy (the art of movement), curative education, youth guidance and social therapy, as well as many other creative endeavors in the sciences, medicine, social work, banking, and the arts. You will notic e the influence of Anthroposophy on our community as you begin your time here at Plowshare Farm. Prayers, blessings, graces at meals, and verses mar k the daily rhythm of life in Plowshare Farm and he lp to foster a devotional and grateful mood among memb ers of the community. We also celebrate seasonal and Christian festivals during the course of the ye ar and these become highlights of the year. The dee per meaning of the festivals in relation to nature and the seasons can becomes a real experience for all. We also celebrate birthdays and other personal celebra tions. We try to cultivate self awareness and aware ness of our interconnectedness - with other people, and our environment. Most Plowshare Farm co-workers have committed to An throposophy as their personal spiritual and meditative path. However, all service volunteers, A meriCorps volunteers and young people are free to pursue their own spiritual practices, within the pr actical constraints of community life, and need not , subscribe to the tenets of Anthroposophy. We ask that you approach the spiritual base of our life with an open mind, and that you do not hinder or undermine the spiritual striving of our community. Plowshare Farm is a nondenominational community whi ch does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, gender or national origin. VOLUNTEER RESPONSIBILITIES The most important responsibility for volunteers is the well-being of the people for whom we care and their environment. Order, cleanliness, and rhythm bring balance into these people's lives, and it is essential that all environments shared by our resid ents are harmonious, well-organized, and free from such modern distractions such as loud music, junk f ood, sodas, and all posters, reading materials etc. which do not reflect a therapeutic environment. During your time with us the Home Life will be a ce ntral activity. The warmth you enkindle and share with the residents will enrich the resident's daily life. Domestic activities such as cleaning, table conversation, laundry, and other household crafts a re not given much recognition in our modern world, yet these simple activities, done with warmth and g ood-nature, bring much healing to people in need of special care, much as they do for children. As you establish relationships, you will become a s pecial friend to the people for whom you care. Bas ic respect for the other human being, regardless of ab ility level, is essential. Caring for our special f riends can at times be frustrating or try your patience. It is easy to imagine that the residents, especiall y the quiet ones are not paying attention to what you are sayin g but they usually do hear. It is important to not speak negatively about the residents and to create a resp ectful atmosphere. Activities are designed with community members in m ind. Even if you think the activity is silly don't participate then roll your eyes or make disparaging remarks about it. It is your responsibility to be the Page 4 of 10 moving force behind the activity. The volunteer sh ould provide the enthusiasm to propel the activity forward. Your concern for proper clothing for the weather, e nough to drink, hygiene, and general well-being is very important. As you get to know our special fri ends you will learn to share some of the small acti vities which bring them pleasure, be it game playing, maki ng music, little walks or outings, or simply sittin g together in the evening. Not knowing how to do something is OK. Plenty of v olunteers have joined us who did not know how to wash dishes, clean a kitchen or bathroom, or do lau ndry. What is important is that, once you have learned, you consistently complete the task at hand with a careful attention to detail. With this pop ulation more than most others, the attention to detail is i mportant. It makes a tremendous difference to the sense of well being if beds are properly made, clothing i s on correctly, and general order and tidiness reig n. The most important gift that you can bring to our community and give to ou r residents is your heart warmth, patience and open minded friendship. The g esture we hope you meet our community members with is one of wonder at who each individual is and how to find your commonality with them. Do not attempt any behavioral modification or therapy. Th is is not your task. Plowshare Farm's coworkers, wi th the exception of office staff, are professional soc ial therapists. Ask the social therapists all your questions but only offer the therapeutic support as directly instructed by a social therapist. I. GENERAL DAILY SCHEDULE Weekdays: All basic house work should be completed between 7-9AM . 7AM Wake the residents and help the residents dress, wash up, shave, some shower, ready for day as needed. Also start laundry, straighten or clean be drooms as needed. Check each residents bedding to make sure the sheets are not soiled. Open the curt ains. Help with meds as needed. 8 AM Breakfast then general housecleaning, hang up laun dry, etc. 8:50 AM Volunteers should help residents prepare for 'goin g to work', proper clothing etc. and bring resident to work location, ready to begin at 9:00 One or two volunteers may care for the animals, pro vide transportation or fulfill other community needs during the morning slot, rather than being re sponsible for people. 9:00 AM -Noon Morning workshop (Volunteers assist in a workshop or this time is scheduled as 'free') 12-12:15 PM - After the morning workshop, it is the volunteer responsibility to bring the workshop participants to the Agora for lunch, helping with h and-washing etc., getting their napkin, settling in for the meal, and the modeling of appropriate table manners and conversation. Lunch begins promptly at 12:15 p.m. As saying Grace before the meal and blessing the meal after the meal is finished are an importan t part of 'holding through rhythm', volunteers are ex pected to learn the graces, say them (or sing them) and encourage 'table neighbors' to participate. Attent ion should be paid that each resident at the meal i s served, has help with cutting if needed, has water, etc. After the meal : the volunteer is expected to help clear the table and encourage the assistance of all residents. Often the volunteer is scheduled for lunch duty. T his volunteer helps serve lunch and helps clean the kitchen after lunch. Chores in the household after lunch time, during the residents' rest hour, such as preparing snack or escorting residents are arranged within the house. Page 5 of 10 The rest periods are for the residents. The reside nts rest periods are usually time for the caregiver s to finish their responsibilities 2:00 PM Per the household schedule, the volunteer or the h ousecarrier prompts residents to arise and prepare for afternoon workshops, and serves snack a t 2PM . Volunteers clean up behind the snack, bring residents to their afternoon workshops, insuring th at all residents have had snack, are appropriately dressed for afternoon workshops, and are at work lo cation, ready to begin at 2:15. 2:15 - 5PM Afternoon workshop (volunteers assist in a worksh op or is scheduled 'free') 5 PM - Volunteers should bring companions home from wor k locations, and help them prepare for the evening. In some cases that includes giving a show er before dinner. Once household companions are home they are showered and settled as necessary. 6 PM dinner If dinner is not in the resident's own home, the v olunteer is responsible to bring the residents to the appropriate house for the evening meal before 6 PM. Attention should be paid that ea ch resident at the meal is served, has help with cutti ng if needed, has water, etc. Clean up follows same guidelines as for lunch. Evening activities are determined by household. Th e volunteer is asked to participate in music evenin g, storynight, playing games or otherwise engaging in a relaxing evening with the residents. Evening time is also a good time to ensure that all laundry is put away and that daily chores are fini shed. Those residents who do not bathe in the morning or before dinner should be given a bath in the evening . At around 8 PM the housecarrier or the volunteer, per the househo ld schedule, provides an evening snack (and cleans up behind the snack). After snack volunteers help the residents prepare f or bed, and brushes teeth. After residents are settled for the evening, the on duty volunteer is free although may only leave the house if the householder, or another volunteer, is presen t. Saturday breakfast is no later than 8:15 , wake up no later than 7:15 Sunday is a 'rest day' for residents. Brunch is at about 10:00, a bit heartier snack, and dinner about 5:30 Often in the evening there are special events. For example Monday night is dinner at a local church. In December we will be practicing the Shepherd's Play on Monday and Thursday nights. During the summer, from the middle of June through the first week of August, we have a summer camp and our schedule changes. There are more recreatio nal activities and activities every evening. No additional time away can be scheduled during this t ime. Although we strive to keep 2 free days we usually have more scheduled in our day. The months of October and May are also busy, with class trips and retreats, and are usually not good times for va cations. Expect to have more responsibilities duri ng these busy times. This is just a rough overview to give you a feel fo r the rhythm of our day. WHO TO GO TO? Your direct supervisor is your householder or works hop leader, depending on the situation. The genera l contact person for volunteers is Nina. She can eit her answer your questions or direct you to the pers on who can. For questions about your household please speak with your householders. Page 6 of 10 Every week there is a volunteer meeting where quest ions can be brought. If you have a concern that you feel has not been me t through other channels then you may bring your concern to Kimberly. II.

SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES In the Agora office, there is a lot of information on the local communities of the surrounding areas. There are road maps, hiking guides, bus and train schedul es. While we are in a very rural setting, there is always something to do. Almost every weekend there is a \"fair\" or \"festival\" of some type. A lot of times co-workers and residents go to these. There are abundant trails in the woods surrounding the fa rm that end in spectacular vistas. The local newspape r, The Monadnock Ledger-Transcript, is a great resource as well to find out what is going on. If you can't get your hands on a paper copy, go online and check out the calendar. Page 10 of 10 We do hope that you find your time volunteering wit h Plowshare Farm Lifesharing Community to be enriching and inspiring . Volunteers have joined us in our work for many years and have contr ibuted greatly to the life of our community. The participation of volunt eers is greatly appreciated and can warm the daily lives of the peo ple for whom we care. We thank you in advance for your valuable "}
