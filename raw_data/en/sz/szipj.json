Vaccine side effects are the physical or emotional responses that some people may experience after receiving a vaccine.

Common Vaccine Side Effects - Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site - Fever - Fatigue - Headache - Muscle aches - Nausea It's important to note that these side effects are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days. In rare cases, more serious side effects can occur, but these are extremely rare and are closely monitored by healthcare professionals.

Here are a few of the most common: - Myth: Vaccines can give you the disease they are designed to prevent.
