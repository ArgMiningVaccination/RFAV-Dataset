These data were the basis for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [approval](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3649914-1&h=3249888685&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.regeneron.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ffda-approves-dupixentr-dupilumab-first-biologic-medicine-0&a=approval) of Dupixent in June 2022 and for a regulatory submission currently under review by the European Medicines Agency. \"The Lancet's publication of these Phase 3 results is a testament to the significance of the data showing dupilumab can alleviate the multidimensional burden that moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis places on infants, toddlers and their families,\" said Amy S. Paller, M.D., Walter J. Hamlin Professor and Chair of Dermatology and Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and principal investigator of the trial. \"By addressing the key inflammatory pathway driving atopic dermatitis, the trial demonstrated that dupilumab not only addressed debilitating symptoms like persistent itch and skin lesions, but also meaningfully improved sleep and reduced pain - two aspects of daily life that are critical for any child's development and well-being.\" Data from this trial showed that adding Dupixent to low-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) significantly improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity and itch compared to TCS alone (placebo) at 16 weeks. Additionally, Dupixent patients experienced significant improvement in measures of sleep quality and skin pain, as well as patient- or caregiver-reported outcomes and health-related quality of life. A substantially lower proportion of Dupixent patients needed rescue medications, compared to those on placebo. Safety results through 16 weeks were similar to the safety profile in patients 6 years and older with atopic dermatitis. Adverse events that were more commonly observed (5%) included placebo). The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in children 6 months to 5 years of age with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority outside the U.S. About Atopic Dermatitis Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Eighty-five to ninety percent of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age, which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense, persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body, resulting in skin dryness, cracking, pain, redness or darkening, and crusting and oozing. In the U.S., more than 75,000 children aged 5 years and younger have uncontrolled moderate-to-severe disease and are most in need of new treatment options. Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of a young child and their caregivers. Current treatment options in this age group are primarily topical steroids, which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term. About the Dupixent Trial The Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of added to standard-of-care low-potency TCS compared to low-potency TCS alone in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Patients treated with Dupixent received either 200 mg or 300 mg (based on weight) every four weeks. The primary endpoints assessed the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and at least a 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16. Secondary endpoints further assessed disease measures and quality of life. Disease measures included additional EASI outcomes, itch reduction, percent of body surface area affected, skin pain, disease severity as measured by the Patient Oriented Eczema Measure, as well as SCORing Atopic Dermatitis measuring a combined assessment of disease area and severity, itch and sleep. Quality of life measures were assessed for children (by Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index for children aged 4 to 17 years and Infants' Dermatitis Quality of Life Index for children less than 4 years of age) and families (by the Dermatitis Family Impact questionnaire), as well as sleep quality. Children who completed the trial were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with Dupixent in this age group. About Dupixent Dupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune\u00ae technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma, atopic diseases such as prurigo nodularis. Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally. About Regeneron's VelocImmune Technology Regeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to [envision](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3649914-1&h=378685737&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3149049-1%26h%3D671178393%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.sciencedirect.com%252Fscience%252Farticle%252Fabs%252Fpii%252F0168952585900897%26a%3Denvision&a=envision) making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite\u00ae technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including prurigo nodularis, pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis, hand urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritis of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. U.S. Indications DUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used: - to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 months of age. - with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. DUPIXENT is not used to treat sudden breathing problems. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age. - with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis under 18 years of age. - to treat adults and children 12 years of age and older, who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg), with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with eosinophilic esophagitis under 12 years of age and who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg). IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Do not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in DUPIXENT\u00ae. Before using DUPIXENT, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you: - have eye problems. - have a parasitic (helminth) infection. - are scheduled to receive any vaccinations. You should not receive a \"live vaccine\" right before and during treatment with DUPIXENT. - are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known whether DUPIXENT will harm your unborn baby. - are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known whether DUPIXENT passes into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the- counter medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you are taking oral, topical, or inhaled corticosteroid medicines; have asthma and use an asthma medicine; or have atopic dermatitis CRSwNP, or EoE, and also have asthma. Do not change or stop your corticosteroid medicine or other asthma medicine without talking to your healthcare provider. This may cause other symptoms that were controlled by the corticosteroid medicine or other asthma medicine to come back. DUPIXENT can cause serious side effects, including: - Allergic reactions. DUPIXENT can cause allergic reactions that can sometimes be severe. Stop using DUPIXENT and tell your healthcare provider or get emergency help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms: breathing problems or wheezing, swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat, fainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, fast pulse, fever, hives, joint pain, general ill feeling, itching, skin rash, swollen lymph nodes, nausea or vomiting, or cramps in your stomach-area. - Eye problems. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any new or worsening eye problems, including eye pain or changes in vision, such as blurred vision. Your healthcare provider may send you to an ophthalmologist for an exam if needed. - Inflammation of your blood vessels. Rarely, this can happen in people with asthma who receive DUPIXENT. This may happen in people who also take a steroid medicine by mouth that is being stopped or the dose is being lowered. It is not known whether this is caused by DUPIXENT. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have: rash, chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, a feeling of pins and needles or numbness of your arms or legs, or persistent fever. - Joint aches and pain.
