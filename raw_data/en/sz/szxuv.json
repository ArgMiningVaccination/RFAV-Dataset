Technology also exacerbates the issue. The modern world we live in is driven by cell phones, computers, and other forms of technology and can make it hard to connect with nature if we are not intentional about doing so. When is the last time you've gone for a walk through the park? Do you feel a connection to the Earth? And if you don't, have you ever? It's easy to overlook spirituality in our lives, but it's key to finding a balance in the chaos. What Is the Importance of Spirituality Through Nature? Humans are part of nature. Whether or not you've ever considered your role in nature, we intrinsically exist within it. Therefore, it's normal to feel a connection or pull towards nature. Due to our busy, technology-heavy lives, we have become further removed from nature. By working toward restoring this spiritual relationship, we will feel more comfortable in our lives and with ourselves. Do you feel like you're falling behind or drowning in obligations and responsibilities? Do you worry that you aren't being the best parent, employee, spouse, or self that you can be? By spiritually reconnecting with nature, you can help mend your fears and become more grounded in your existence. Life is overwhelming, but nature helps us remember the beauty and calmness of it. So, how can you get started in establishing a spiritual connection with nature? Go For Long Walks Outside One of the best ways to connect with nature is to go for walks. Ideally, you can find a park or trail to walk down. However, depending on where you live, you may only be able to walk around your neighborhood. As long as you're getting outside, it counts! By mindfully noticing and embracing the trees, flowers, animals, and insects that you come across, you'll feel more grounded and connected. Going for long walks outside also helps to reduce stress and promote mindfulness \u2014 things that we greatly benefit from. Fill Your House with Plants If you can't always get out and experience nature, why not bring nature to you? House plants are typically low maintenance, inexpensive to obtain and make your house look and feel wonderful. Plants bring a much-needed liveliness to your home, and by having them around, you may feel a stronger connection to nature in general. Focus on Your Connection to the Earth We are one of many creatures on this planet, but sometimes it's easy to lose sight of that. Instead of seeing ourselves as part of the Earth, we instead see ourselves as users of the Earth's resources \u2014 and this causes problems for us and the planet itself. When you focus on your connection to the Earth, you have a much stronger sense of your role on this planet. Start by noticing the little connections you see in nature. All animals play a role in maintaining the ecosystem, and there is a powerful sense of togetherness within that. Instead of viewing yourself separate from nature, begin to notice your role in the ecosystem, too. Open Your Mind to New Possibilities The best thing you can do for yourself and others is to embrace an open mind. Understand that the world is full of new perspectives that you may have never previously considered. As we grow up, we establish our own opinions and thoughts about certain things. By keeping an open mind, you can embrace others' opinions and accept them just as you do your own. One of the most powerful ways to embrace spirituality is to understand your inherent connection to other humans. We all exist on this planet together, within it and through it. By keeping an open mind, you open yourself to a lifetime of fulfillment and spirituality through nature.
