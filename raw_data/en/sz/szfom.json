This rule only applies to Schedule II, III, or IV Controlled Substances. 3.0 Definitions 3.1 \"Abuse\" mean s a maladaptive pattern of drug use tha t results in harm or places the individual at risk of harm. Abuse of a prescription medication involves its use in a manner that deviates from approved medical, legal, and social standards, generally to achieve a euphoric state (\"high\") or to sustain opioid dependence that is opioid addiction or that is other than the purpose for which the medication was prescribed.
