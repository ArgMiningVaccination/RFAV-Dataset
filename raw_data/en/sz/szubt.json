By Tom Herrin A concern for health is something that everyone shares in one way or another. Making sure to have all of the available information in order to make a decision that is best for an individual and anyone in their care is a pretty tall order. As vaccines have been developed and tested at what may be considered relative great speed, results of the trials continue to look promising. It has been well publicized that healthcare workers are given vaccines first and that those who are older, or otherwise at risk, may be next in line. The time will pass faster than many realize until the time in which the general population will have decisions to make regarding taking a vaccine themselves. It deserves careful thought. Vaccines Have Saved Many Lives The history of vaccinations has been mixed. Some have had a tremendous impact on the population. The original smallpox vaccine must have seemed like a miracle. Even though there may have been some issues with it, the effect on the world is that it eradicated a dangerous virus. This is theoretically possible with viruses. The MMR vaccine has been similarly successful. Measles was a devastating illness to some, and rubella was extremely threatening to the unborn. Vaccines against bacterial illnesses are different but have had some success. They will never be wiped out, but a good program has been highly successful with things such as tetanus. Vaccines Have Posed Threats The other side of the vaccine problem is that many people have soreness and irritation at injection sites. Beyond this, many people have fever and minor illness due to vaccines. In the more serious reactions, some people have had seizures and even death. It is not something to take lightly. Thinking through how a loved one has reacted to previous vaccines is something to keep in mind. An individual's immune response may be unique. Consult the Best Sources For sure, it is unwise to rely on hearsay. Have heard people say they believe the will be implanted with a code for tracking, or some other thing. These individuals may have confused their facts. Some of the newly developed vaccines may be using a code instead of a live virus, but the code has to do with the make-up of the virus. The vaccine is attacking it in higher tech ways rather than introducing some kind of virus into the body. With a potentially serious virus, it is worth the time any of us spend doing our own research. When we make that decision in the not-so-distant future, we want it to be one that is well thought out, and one we can live with.
