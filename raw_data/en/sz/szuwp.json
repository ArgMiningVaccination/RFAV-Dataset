Summaries Of The News: [ Rural Medicare Programs Extended In Short-Term Spending Bill ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/rural-medicare-programs-extended-in-short-term-spending-bill/) The congressionally-passed bill that keeps the federal government funded through mid-December included two Medicare programs. The Medicare Dependent Hospital program would have otherwise expired, while the Low-Volume Hospital program would have lost expanded eligibility criteria, Modern Healthcare reports. [ Modern Healthcare: Rural Medicare Programs Get Short-Term Extensions From Congress ](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/rural-medicare-programs-get-short-term-extensions-congress) Two Medicare programs that boost payments for hundreds of rural hospitals were extended through mid-December with the House's passage of a short-term federal spending package on Friday. (Kane, 9/30) [ Fierce Healthcare: Congress Passes Spending Bill That Extends Rural Programs ](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/congress-passes-short-term-spending-bill-extends-two-key-rural-hospital-programs) The House voted 230 to 201 to advance to President Joe Biden's desk a continuing resolution that funds the federal government through Dec. 16. Biden is expected to sign the legislation. The short-term package gives providers another chance to include key end-of-the-year policy priorities such as delays to Medicare doctor payment cuts and extensions of a key quality bonus. The legislation also extends through Dec. 16 the hospital payment adjustment for certain low-volume hospitals (LVH) and the Medicare-Dependent Hospital (MDH) program. Both programs were set to expire after September.

Nearly 50,000 people die each year in the U.S. from drug-resistant and antibiotic-associated infections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency says the crisis grew worse during Covid-19 as doctors over-prescribed antibiotics and inundated hospitals failed to control drug-resistant infections, which spiked by at least 15 percent in 2020.

The Food and Drug Administration said recent entrants to the U.S. market will have until October 2025 to make sure their formulas comply with federal standards for nutrition, labeling and manufacturing. The agency noted that some companies should be able to meet those requirements sooner.

The drug Relyvrio was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, making it the third ALS treatment to get the regulator's nod after Japanese firm Mitsubishi Tanabe's Radicava, priced at around $170,000 per year, and the generic drug riluzole. (Leo, 9/30) [ Axios: New ALS Treatment Sparks Yet Another Drug Pricing Debate ](https://www.axios.com/2022/10/03/als-treatment-fda-drug-prices) The FDA's expedited approval of a new ALS treatment priced at $158,000 a year, has touched off another debate over balancing regulation with patient access.

Responsibility for funding so-called compassionate use has always fallen to drugmakers, though many are unwilling or unable to make their drugs available for free to dying patients. After years of lobbying Congress, patients with the debilitating illness known as Lou Gehrig's disease have found an unprecedented solution: make the federal government pay.

Environmental protections, election law, and gay rights are already on the justices' docket, and other health-related cases are expected. [ The Wall Street Journal: Supreme Court Term Opens With New Justice And Weighty Cases ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-term-opens-with-new-justice-and-weighty-cases-11664719205) The Supreme Court opens its new term Monday with a new member, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, and a docket that could reshape features of American society ranging from college admissions to political redistricting. Monday's first case, Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, could offer an early sign of whether the court's 6-3 conservative majority will continue the refashioning of federal law they pursued last term, with opinions that eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion and expanded religion's place in public education. (Bravin and Wolfe, 10/2) [ The New York Times: As New Term Starts, Supreme Court Is Poised To Resume Rightward Push ](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/02/us/conservative-supreme-court-legitimacy.html) The last Supreme Court term ended with a series of judicial bombshells in June that eliminated the right to abortion, established a right to carry guns outside the home and limited efforts to address climate change. As the justices return to the bench on Monday, there are few signs that the court's race to the right is slowing. The new term will feature major disputes on affirmative action, voting, religion, free speech and gay rights. And the court's six-justice conservative supermajority seems poised to dominate the new term as it did the earlier one. \"On things that matter most,\" said Irv Gornstein, the executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown Law, \"get ready for a lot of 6-3s.\" (Liptak, 10/2) [ Politico: A Shaken Supreme Court Returns To Chambers ](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/02/damaged-supreme-court-returns-00059911) Speaking at a judges' conference in Colorado last month, Chief Justice John Roberts sounded exhausted by it all. \"The last year was an unusual one and difficult in many respects. It was gut-wrenching every morning to drive into a Supreme Court with barricades around it,\" Roberts said. \"I think, with my colleagues, we're all working to move beyond it.\" (Gerstein, 10/2) [ AP: Supreme Court Poised To Keep Marching To Right In New Term ](https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-abortion-ketanji-brown-jackson-us-supreme-court-health-0c7e7f12f32f30fe97d2b9417a24cf69) Last term's epic decisions might have produced bruised feelings among the justices anyway. But the leak of the abortion decision in early May, seven weeks before it was released, exacerbated tensions on the court, several justices have said. The court has apparently not identified the source of the leak, Justice Stephen Breyer said in a recent interview on CNN. Justice Elena Kagan delivered a series of talks over the summer in which she said the public's view of the court can be damaged especially when changes in its membership lead to big changes in the law. \"It just doesn't look like law when some new judges appointed by a new president come in and start just tossing out the old stuff,\" Kagan said in an appearance last month at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island.

The ruling from Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson means the state's abortion providers will not be able to restart procedures. Abortions were halted on Sept. 23 when Johnson ruled that a 1973 injunction must be lifted so that the Civil War-era law could be enforced.

The bill was withdrawn the same day it was introduced, but it represents renewed interest in greatly restricting abortion in Puerto Rico after the Supreme Court threw out its 1973 Roe v.

This corner of the Bay Area had become a prime example of a highly educated, affluent community with low childhood vaccination rates, driven by a contingent of liberal parents skeptical of traditional medicine. Marin was something of a paradox to mainstream Democrats, and often a punching bag.
