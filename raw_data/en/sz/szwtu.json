It would be a great boon for young couples to know how to prepare for a child by cleansing themselves physically, mentally, emotionally and how to clean the sperm and ovum . Looking forward to you thoughts on this. A: The shukra Shodhana and Yoni Vishodhana effect is brought about by undergoing Virechana Panchakarma treatment. Before planning for conception, if the couple can visit an Ayurveda center, then they will be guided through the procedure. If they cannot visit, I think they can safely take around 5 ml of castor oil during weekend. The next morning, they may have lose stools for 2 - 4 times, which would stop by itself. They may repeat it for up to four weekends. If the lose stools are not getting under control, they can take Kutaja Ghanavati tablet - 2 tablets 2 times a day, after food, till it stops. Better to have this tablet ready, well ahead. If things are not getting under control, they will have to consult a doctor immediately. So, it comes with certain amount of risk. Hence, a doctor's direct advice is recommended.
