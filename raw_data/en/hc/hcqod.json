B.E.S.T. removes the emotional interference and/or distractions that are demanding the attention of the healing power and causing an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system. Options for Optimal Health Anyone whose life has been touched by cancer knows it affects the whole person\u2014body, mind, and spirit. Your oncologist is responsible for treatment of your condition. Only you can be responsible for regaining your health. Fundamental to B.E.S.T. therapy is learning to think, consciously, in ways that enhance the body's healing capacity. \"I would never say that I treat cancer,\" says Dr. Sones. \"I do not treat conditions. I treat people with conditions. Addressing the cause, which is always associated with The Six Essentials for Life, allows the condition to begin to resolve.\" Unique to B.E.S.T. therapy is the ability to draw information from the subconscious mind of the patient, identify a \"feeling,\" and link the feeling to a past experience. The experience is related to the condition and represents a \"timing problem.\" This is never appropriate. You live and heal in the present moment. The procedure \"updates\" and neutralizes the effect of a memory, changing the perception of the experience from a negative to a positive. When the effect of the experience is neutralized, healing can begin. Healing cannot be forced. It can only be allowed. Researched at major universities, taught as an elective in many chiropractic colleges and in professional continuing education seminars, B.E.S.T. is recognized as an effective healing science. It complements traditional medical treatment by physicians. While the M.D. focuses on the disease, with B.E.S.T. treatments, the patient is taught how to regain their health. This approach empowers the patient to become an active participant in the healing process. I know how to inspire my patients to believe that they can be perfectly well. I take patients through four stages of awareness: Hope\u2014Faith\u2014Belief\u2014Knowingness. Everyone has a 'potential' for health. I am not concerned with conditions or statistics, only potential. Where there is breath there is hope and where there is hope there is possibility. I am an eleven-year cancer survivor. I had completed my \"conventional treatment\" at M.D. Anderson when I began seeing Dr. Sones. I realized that it was important to take care of my WHOLE body - physical, spiritual, and emotional - as I did not wish to have a recurrence; a fear that all cancer survivors must deal with. The B.E.S.T. therapy helped me keep my priorities and goals in focus, gave me an energy boost during stressful times, and helped me to release some of the emotional \"garbage\" I had been carrying around. Did I mention I had also gone through a very painful and enlightening divorce during this time? I truly feel that Dr. Sones has helped me to de-stress, stay strong, and live long, to the \"best\" of my ability! - Elaine Jones Discover how Dr. Sones can help you with your cancer recovery chiropractic needs. Call Today: 281-367-3047 B.E.S.T. restores the body's timing to present-moment need. All body systems - immune, cardiovascular, endocrine, digestive, respiratory, excretory, nervous, etc. - are balanced, and the body begins to respond to stimulation from the environment, internally and externally, in the \"now\" as it should. \"I believe more people succumb to the diagnosis of cancer than the disease,\" says Dr. Sones. \"They may have been living with the disease for years but when they hear the diagnosis, the perception of doom and the effect on the body go into 'memory' at the physical, mental, and emotional levels. Healing is suppressed in this state of mind.\" Stress suppresses the immune system, which plays an essential role in the recovery from cancer or any other condition. To strengthen the immune system, emotional stress is addressed with the B.E.S.T. procedure. Every thought we have has its root in one of two basic emotions: love or fear. Trying to heal when the mind is in a state of anxiety (fear) is futile. Hope and belief in your ability to heal is the antidote to the fear that accompanies a serious diagnosis. Proper nutritional support is also essential for the body to repair and rebuild. Nutritional recommendations are specific to each patient and fundamental to the B.E.S.T. procedure. When the body is balanced, both emotionally and nutritionally, the probability of a positive outcome is greatly increased. Healing, like happiness, is an inside-out process. Patients who experience amazing outcomes seem to have two things in common: They believe they can be perfectly well, and they focus more on living, rather than the alternative. As a coach, Dr. Sones's goal is to give you the tools to create your own miracle! Read About Cancer Recovery Chiropractic Patients Click on the names to read their personal cancer recovery stories. I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, stage 3C, in January of 1997. I've been a patient of M.D. Anderson since my diagnosis. I've always been pro-active and aggressive with my choice of treatments: choosing twice to participate in clinical trials. I've had two stem-cell transplants with high dose chemotherapy, standard chemo, two surgeries to debulk tumors and radiation. And now I am undergoing more chemotherapy. From the beginning I chose to accept this condition, become knowledgeable and informed about this disease, then believe in the doctors I have chosen to give me the best medical care available. So much for the physical treatment. After living with cancer for 12 years to date, and all the \"issues\" that cancer causes in one's life, I found it was my emotional health that was as important as my physical health and how uniquely intertwined these two conditions are. Cancer can be all-consuming, living and feeling it daily. This is no way to fully live and the physical body cannot function at its best when the mind is always in a state of turmoil, worry, and anxiety. That was the distress I was feeling in 2004, although my cancer was in remission. I began seeing a chiropractor, Dr. Robert Sones, in The Woodlands, Texas. Dr. Sones specializes in addressing the mental and emotional barriers to healing. He uses a treatment procedure called Bio Energetic Synchronization Technique [BEST]. He does not treat cancer. That is the role of the oncologist. Most important, he gave me the tools to address the emotional issues that go with the diagnosis of cancer. To me, cancer isn't just a physical trauma; it's also an emotional trauma and then a spiritual journey. I'm not saying religious but rather a spiritual, self-realization, and soul-searching journey. My ultimate goal is to make this diagnosis the most profound event to positively change my life. Dr. Sones and the BEST technique have helped me regain a sense of control when cancer took that from me. Anxiety about outcomes does not consume my every waking moment any longer. Life is good, even great! I believe the body can heal when the mind is at peace. - Catherine E. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in May this year (2009) and I am currently receiving treatment at M.D. Anderson. Cancer diagnosis and treatment are very stressful. At the time, a colleague of mine, who is also a breast cancer survivor, suggested Dr. Sones, who had helped her during her treatment. With the hope to have my treatment going smoothly, I started seeing Dr. Sones in August, right after my chemotherapy started. Dr. Sones uses the B.E.S.T. therapy technique to balance my conscious and subconscious mind and support my ability to heal. The methods he has shown me for calmness and peace have helped tremendously for dealing with the emotional stress and side effects of chemotherapy as I continue my treatment. Seeing Dr. Sones is like an energy boost to me, and most importantly, he makes me believe that there is always hope. The B.E.S.T therapy has helped me to stay strong and keep focusing on my treatment with a very positive attitude. This technique of overcoming fear and giving hope to patients could be put to a very good use at M.D. Anderson, where many people live with such dread of treatment and the uncertainty in their life. I think it could be a great addition to the Department of Integrative Medicine. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in June of 2007 and received treatment at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. At the time, my G.I. specialist, Dr. John Mathias, suggested that I see his colleague, Dr. Robert Sones, to help me deal with my health during this time. I didn't feel I had the energy to see one more doctor, so I waited until after my surgery to see Dr. Sones. I started seeing him in March of 2008. Dr. Sones used his B.E.S.T. procedure to balance my conscious and subconscious mind to help me heal. He helped me to see that there is always hope. The methods he has shown me for calmness and peace have helped tremendousl, as I continue my journey. I now truly feel my cancer has been conquered. This procedure for overcoming fear and giving hope to patients could help anyone living with the dread of treatment and the uncertainty in their life. - Barbara M. On October 12, 2007 my oncologist gave me the shocking news of my PET scan, which revealed that I had Stage 3 breast cancer. It had also spread to my lymph nodes. He told me that I would need three sessions of chemo and then a bilateral mastectomy. I was scheduled to see the surgeon on the 16th October to have a port-cath put in and to start chemotherapy on 18th October. My children were very concerned. They told me that we must have a second opinion and not to rush for chemo. We were given two weeks to make our decision, and we cancelled the appointment to begin chemo. Because of my nursing background I was worried, thinking, \"what are these children doing? This cancer is already in the lymph nodes...it could spread more.\" But being on a spiritual path I left my worries to the Lord, thinking there must be a good reason for the delay as God does work mysteriously. I called my friend Lynn and told her everything. She told me to see Dr. Sones. Initially I did not know anything about the B.E.S.T. technique, and I wondered why I should see a chiropractor when I had breast cancer. I am so grateful to the Lord that I listened to Lynn and went to see Dr. Sones on the 19th October. Dr. Sones was very kind, explained healing, and discussed what my responsibilities were. I learned that my body could begin to heal if the blockages were removed. He advised me to remain calm, be positive, and have no fear. I saw Dr. Sones twice a week for the first two weeks. He counseled me on my diet, recommended nutritional support, and taught me how emotions could help or hinder my potential for healing. I had faith in the Lord and at the end of two weeks was already feeling changes in my lumps. When I went to see a second oncologist on November 2nd, I asked her to give me one month before starting chemo. She agreed and I was delighted. I had another ultrasound on 21st November. My first oncologist called me, saying there were no changes and that I must begin chemo. But it was my body and I was in charge. I was feeling well and continued seeing Dr. Sones. He never discouraged me from having chemotherapy, saying that decision was between me and my oncologist, but rather reassured me that he would support me in whatever decisions I made about my treatment. He gave me hope and confidence and supported me emotionally. On 11th December I went and saw my first oncologist. I had another round of blood work done. That same day the oncologist told me that I did not have to take chemotherapy, but he gave me some tablets to reduce the hormones in my body. One month later, 10th January, 2008, I had another PET scan. There was no cancer activity! My oncologist was amazed at the results. It was truly a miracle. My family and friends were thrilled. I would definitely recommend anyone to go to Dr. Sones and try B.E.S.T. There are no side effects from this therapy. All you get is loving care and a healthier body. - R.
