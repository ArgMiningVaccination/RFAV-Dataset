If you want to spend money on vitamins, spent it in the produce aisle, say local health experts. \"Eat well. That's your primary source of vitamins,\" says Steve Armatas, director of pharmacy operations for Aultman Hospital. \"Food first,\" agrees Kathy Wise. \"If you pay attention, think balance, you can get what you need,\" said Wise, director of health and wellness at Mercy Hospital. \"Here's my take on vitamins \u2014 you don't really need them, but if your diet isn't the best, you could treat them like an insurance policy. Take a multi-vitamin, with no more than 100 percent of the recommended daily intake.\" Karen Russell believes it is not as easy today as in the past to get all your vitamins and minerals from food. \"Unfortunately, the soil is depleted, so even when you buy organic or from a local farmer that puts nutrients back in the soil, you may not get all you need,\" said Russell, a certified health coach for the Center for Holistic Medicine at 4414 22nd St. NW. Russell recommends taking a good-quality multi-vitamin. If she's not sure about the quality, she checks out the brand at www.consumerlab.com. \"It's a non-partial lab that tests supplements for contaminants, for dissolving, to see if ingredients on the label are in the vitamin,\" Russell said. Wise says consumers need not worry about whether a vitamin is organic, food-based or synthetic. \"The body can't tell if it comes from food or is synthetic. If it's vitamin C, it has to be a vitamin C molecule, so it doesn't matter from that standpoint,\" Wise said. \"But it should be pure. Look at the ingredients label \u2014 you shouldn't see a lot of additives in there.\" Gwen Graham, who has owned the Olive Branch Health Food Center, 1105 Whipple Ave. NW, for 21 years, tells customers to avoid brightly colored vitamins. \"I'm totally against a multi that has coloring in it. Make sure it's natural color, not a synthetic. If it's a real bright color, that's big red flag,\" Graham said. \"And sugar \u2014 look for that, especially for children. The gummy bears and such have more sugar in them than nutrition. And that's an expensive way to get sugar in your body.\" Graham says to look for some kind of stamp of approval on vitamins, like the \"GMP\" (Good Manufacturing Practices) seal from the National Nutritional Foods Association. \"(Manufacturers) can put in fillers like talc that can be dangerous,\" Graham said. \"If they use junk cheap fillers, you can be actually causing more harm to yourself than good.\" Graham recommends the NOW line of vitamins. \"The prices are a little lower than some other companies,\" she said. \"In fact, in the past, people thought because (NOW) wasn't as expensive, the quality wasn't there, but that has totally changed. They've been recognized with many awards.\" What about megadoses? Russell advises caution. \"In some things it's OK, some not. For water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C, we need more than the RDA (recommended daily allowance). Sometimes we need more to fight something off,\" Russell said. \"But the fat solubles \u2014 you don't want too much of those.\" Wise says megadoses of one mineral can artificially make your body think it has enough of a different mineral. \"You can get yourself into as much trouble with a megadose as not doing anything at all, especially with minerals and fat solubles,\" Wise said. \"Too much can even be toxic.\" Armatas warned against claims that vitamins are a cure-all and said scientific studies haven't supported the use of megadoses. \"Don't fall victim to advertising about the benefits of megadoses of vitamins,\" he said. \"Nothing has been proven to show megadoses provide a benefit, so you're throwing your money away.\" Armatas said a multi-vitamin is sufficient, along with a vitamin D supplement for the elderly or others who are not getting enough time in the sunshine. \"You don't need to spend tons of money on this. If you're spending more than $10 a month, you're probably spending too much,\" he said. \"And avoid fortified foods. They sell you all these foods fortified with vitamins and charge you an arm and leg for that. There is no need for that. You just need a good balanced diet \u2014 fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and avoid red meat and unhealthy fats as much as possible \u2014 and you'll get "}
