The draft revisions address programmatic standards that are unique or specific to the advanced practice doctoral program. Standards and criteria applicable to all accredited programs remain unchanged by this proposal and apply to all accredited programs including this program. Before making any substantive changes to its Comprehensive Standards and Criteria, it is the Commission's long-standing practice to provide notice to all relevant stakeholders and constituencies of proposed changes; give the interested parties adequate opportunity to comment on the proposed changes; and use the input received to help inform final decisions. This call for public comment is open through Sunday, July 2, 2023. For details on the public comment process, [click here](https://acahm.org/2023/06/02/call-for-public-comment-proposed-revisions-to-advanced-practice-daom-doctoral-program/). Commission announces 7 October 2023 as end date for COVID-19 flexibilities On 18 May 2023, the US Department of Education issued a \"Dear Colleague letter\" that established 7 October 2023 as the end date for waivers or flexibilities in Federal regulations, rules and policies relating to higher education. This includes flexibilities relating to distance education. This date is approximately one month earlier than was anticipated, based upon the White House's long-stated intention to end the national public health emergency on 11 May 2023. ACAHM reaffirms that it will adhere to its [Distance Education Policy](https://acahm.org/policies/distance-education/). Based on the Department of Education guidance referenced above, ACAHM-accredited programs and institutions must receive 1.15 initial substantive change accreditation no later than 7 October 2023 if they wish to continue offering courses or any portion of an ACAHM-accredited program via distance education beyond that date. It is imperative for programs and institutions to submit 1.15 applications as soon as possible. ACAHM is committed to an accreditation process that adds value to institutions/programs while contributing to public accountability. We appreciate the continued cooperation and support of all the Commission's constituents and stakeholders in this process. Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine 8 September 2021: The Commission met in June 2021 and adopted a new name for the organization: effective 8 September 2021, the organization will be called the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine (ACAHM). A formal and final name change will take some time because it must be carried out in compliance with relevant laws and regulatory requirements. However, we are committed to implementing this change as soon as possible. Staff have begun the process of removing the term \"oriental\" from all Commission documents including standards, policies and procedures, and this website. For the time being, [https://www.acahm.org](https://www.acahm.org) forwards to the Commission's longstanding domain address. It is likely that staff and Commission Email addresses will be among the last things to change. This decision follows a five-year review process that considered and analyzed perceptions of the word \"Oriental\" within the acupuncture and herbal medicine community. As an organization that accredits educational programs rooted in the traditions and philosophies of several Asian cultures, we have a deep respect for the backgrounds that have enabled the successful treatment of a host of symptoms, diseases, and medical conditions. When the organization was founded nearly four decades ago, \"Oriental\" was widely accepted both in society and within our community of practitioners, professionals, and schools. But times have changed and so must we. We have conducted years of research into this matter, including a survey of 1,700 individuals that evaluated community perception of the incorporation of alternative terms for \"Oriental medicine\" within ACAOM-accreditable degree titles. While survey results yielded no consensus, ACAOM proactively issued a policy to rename degrees to eliminate use of the term \"Oriental\" from certain programs. The name for the Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine has not been changed, although this is still being considered and input from schools running DAOM programs will be solicited. In June 2021, a special meeting of the commission was called to discuss a change to the organizational name. Prior to the meeting, eight potential names were presented to commissioners along with a list of considerations for each name. After careful deliberation, the commissioners ultimately reached unanimous agreement that the new name would be the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine - a decision that was reaffirmed during our August 2021 meeting. ACAHM Statement Deploring Racism and Violence Against Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Individuals of Asian Descent 8 September 2021*: The Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine (ACAHM), founded in 1982 and re-named in 2021, accredits educational programs rooted in the traditions and philosophies of several Asian cultures. We deplore the recent attacks and the rise in anti-Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) violence and harassment and join with our community of schools and colleges, faculty, students, and the professionals in our field in condemning these racist acts. Words of support, healing, and prayer are helpful, but also are insufficient. It is incumbent upon each of us individually and collectively to identify, understand and root out bias, discrimination, and oppression in all forms and ACAHM is committed to this outcome. ACAHM is a member of and has actively participated in the Acupuncture Medicine Cultural Competency Task Force (AMCCTF) that was created in 2020, to provide tools to help educate students, practitioners, and members of our profession in cultural competency, and we are committed to continuing this work and engaging our communities of interest.

Flexibilities adopted by the Commission were published on 18 May 2020.
