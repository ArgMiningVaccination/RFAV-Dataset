Whiting, PhD; Robert IMPORTANCE Cannabis and cannabinoid drugs are widely used to treat disease or alleviate symptoms, but their efficacy for specific indications is not clear. OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review of the benefits and adverse events (AEs) of cannabinoids. DATA SOURCES Twenty-eight databases from inception to April 2015. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of cannabinoids for the following indications: nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, appetite stimulation in HIV/AIDS, chronic pain,spasticity due to multiple sclerosis or paraplegia, depression, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder,psychosis, glaucoma, or Tourette syndrome. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. All review stages were conducted independently by 2 reviewers. Where possible, datawere pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patient-relevant/disease-specific outcomes, activities of daily living, quality of life, global impression of change, and AEs. RESULTS A total of 79 trials (6462 participants) were included; 4 were judged at low risk of bias. Most trials showed improvement in symptoms associated with cannabinoids but theseassociations did not reach statistical significance in all trials. Compared with placebo,cannabinoids were associated with a greater average number of patients showing a completenausea and vomiting response (47% vs 20%; odds ratio [OR], 3.82 [95% CI, 1.55-9.42];3 trials), reduction in pain (37% vs 31%; OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.99-2.00]; 8 trials), a greateraverage reduction in numerical rating scale pain assessment (on a 0-10-point scale; weightedmean difference [WMD], 0.46 [95% reduction inthe Ashworth spasticity scale (WMD, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.01]; 5 trials). There was anincreased risk of short-term AEs with cannabinoids, including serious AEs. Common AEsincluded dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, fatigue, somnolence, euphoria, vomiting,disorientation, drowsiness, confusion, loss of balance, and hallucination. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There was moderate-quality evidence to support the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain and spasticity. There was low-quality evidencesuggesting that cannabinoids were associated with improvements in nausea and vomitingdue to chemotherapy, weight gain in HIV infection, sleep disorders, and Tourette syndrome.Cannabinoids were associated with an increased risk of short-term AEs.

Medical cannabis refers to the use of cannabis or canna- binoids as medical therapy to treat disease or alleviatesymptoms. Cannabinoids can be administered orally, sub-lingually,or topically; they can be smoked, inhaled, mixedwith food, or made into tea. They can be taken in herbalform, extracted naturally from the plant, gained by isomeri-sation of cannabidiol, or manufactured synthetically. legalized cannabis forchronically ill patients. Canada and the Netherlands programs in which specialized companiessupply quality-controlled herbal cannabis. 5In the United States, 23 states and Washington, DC (May 2015), have intro-duced laws to permit the medical use of cannabis 6; other countries have similar laws. The aim of this systematicreview was to evaluate the evidence for the benefits andadverse events (AEs) of medical cannabinoids across abroad range of indications. Methods ThisreviewfollowedguidancepublishedbytheCentreforRe-viewsandDisseminationandtheCochraneCollaboration. 7,8 We established a protocol for the review (eAppendix 1 inSupplement1 ). Study Eligibility Criteria Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared cannabi- noids with usual care, placebo, or no treatment in the follow-ing indications were eligible: nausea and vomiting due tochemotherapy, appetite stimulation in HIV/AIDS, chronicpain, spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (MS) or paraplegia,depression, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder, psychosis, intra-ocular pressure in glaucoma, or Tourette syndrome. Theseindications were prespecified by the project funders, theSwiss Federal Office of Public Health. If no RCTs were avail-ableforaparticularindicationoroutcome(eg,long-termAEssuch as cancer, psychosis, depression, or suicide), nonran-domizedstudiesincludinguncontrolledstudies(suchascaseseries)withatleast25patientswereeligible. Identification and Selection of Studies Twenty-eight databases and gray literature sources weresearched from inception to April 2015 without language re-striction (Embase search strategy consen- susorreferraltoathirdreviewer. Data Collection and Study Appraisal We extracted data about baseline characteristics and out-comes (patient-relevant and disease-specific outcomes,activities of daily living, quality of life, global impression ofchange, and specified AEs). For dichotomous data such asnumber of patients with at least 30% improvement in pain,we calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI. For categoricaldata, we extracted details about each category assessed andthe numbers of patients with an outcome in each category.ContinuousdatasuchastheAshworthspasticityscore 10were extracted as means and SDs at baseline, follow-up, and thechange from baseline and used to calculate mean differenceswith 95% CIs. Results (mean difference, 95% CIs, and Pval- ues) from the between-group statistical analyses reported bythe study were also extracted. All relevant sources were usedfor data extraction including full-text journal articles,abstracts, and clinical trial registry entries. Where available,the journal article was used as the primary publicationbecauseithadbeenpeerreviewed. RCTswereassessedformethodologicalqualityusingthe CochraneRiskofBiastool. 11Ifatleastoneofthedomainswas rated as high, the trial was considered at high risk of bias. Ifalldomainswerejudgedaslow,thetrialwasconsideredatlowriskofbias.Otherwise,thetrialwasconsideredashavingun-clearriskofbias.Dataextractionandrisk-of-biasassessmentwere performed independently by 2 reviewers; disagree-mentswereresolvedbyathirdreviewer. Synthesis Clinical heterogeneity was assessed by grouping studies byindication, cannabinoid, and outcome. If there were 2 ormore trials within a single grouping, data were pooled usingrandom-effects meta-analysis. 12For continuous outcomes, we analyzed the mean difference in change from baseline; ifthis was not reported and could not be calculated fromother data, we used the mean difference at follow-up. 13For dichotomousdata,weusedtheOR.Inordertoavoiddoublecounting, we selected a single data set from each study tocontribute to the analysis. For studies evaluating multipleinterventions, we selected the intervention or dose that wasmost similar to the other interventions being evaluated inthe same analysis. Heterogeneity was investigated usingforest plots and the I 2statistic. Where data were considered too heterogeneous to pool or not reported in a format suit-able for pooling (eg, data reported as medians), we used anarrative synthesis. Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the statistical effect of trial design. The primary analysis included onlyparallel-group trials, results from crossover trials wereincluded in an additional analysis. For the analysis of AEs,data for all conditions were combined. We conducted strati-fied analyses and meta-regression to investigate whetherassociations varied according to type of cannabinoid, studydesign (parallel group vs crossover trial), indication (each ofthe indication categories included in this report), compara-Cannabinoids for Medical Use Original Investigation Research jama.com (Reprinted) JAMA June 23/30, 2015 Volume 313, Number 24 2457 Copyright 2015 American Medical Association.

A totalof 79 studies (6462 participants), available as 151 reports,wereincluded;3studies(6reports)wereincludedinmultipleindication categories ( Figure 1 ). Thirty-four studies were parallel-group trials (4436 participants), and 45 were cross-over trials (2026 participants). Four studies were availableonly as an abstract, 15-18a further 3 were available only as abstracts19-21butwithadditionaldetailsavailableontrialreg- istriesincludingfullresultsinone,19anddetailsof2trials(in- cluding full trial results) were available only as trial registryentries 22,23; all other trials were reported in full-length jour- nal articles. Where reported, the proportion of participantswho were men ranged from 0% to 100% (median, 50% [57studies]), and the proportion of white participants rangedfrom 50% to 99% (median, 78% [18 studies]). Publicationdatesrangedfrom1975to2015(median,2004[withone-thirdof trials published before 1990]). Studies were conducted in awide range of countries. A variety of cannabinoids wereevaluated and compared with various different active com-parators or placebos; most active comparators were includedin the nausea vomiting indication ( Table 1). eAppendices 3t o1 2i n Supplement 1 provide an overview of the included studiesandtheirfindings. Four (5%) trials were judged at low risk of bias, 55 (70%) were judged at high risk of bias, and 20 (25%) at unclear riskof bias (eAppendix 13 in Supplement 2 ). The major potential source of bias in the trials was incomplete outcome data.More than 50% of trials reported substantial withdrawalsand did not adequately account for this in the analysis.Selective outcome reporting was a potential risk of bias in16% of trials. These studies did not report data for all out-comes specified in the trial register, protocol, or methodssection or changed the primary outcome from that whichwas prespecified. Most studies reported being double-blinded but only 57% reported that appropriate methodshad been used for participant blinding and only 24%reported that outcome assessors had been appropriatelyblinded. Full results from included studies are presented in eAp- pendices3-12in Supplement2 ;pooledresultsandGRADErat- ingsarepresentedin Table2. Nausea and Vomiting Due to Chemotherapy Nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy was assessed in 28 studies (37 reports; 1772 participants).15,16,24-58Fourteen studies assessed nabilone and there were 3 for dronabinol, 1for nabiximols, 4 for levonantradol, and 6 for THC. Twostudies also included a combination therapy group of dron-abinol with ondansetron or prochlorperazine. Eight studiesincluded a placebo control, 3 of these also included anactive comparator, and 20 studies included only an activecomparator. The most common active comparators wereprochlorperazine (15 studies), (aliza-pride, hydroxyzine, metoclopramide and ondansetron)were evaluated in single studies (Table 1). Of all 28 studies,Figure 1.

All studies sug- gested a greater benefit of cannabinoids compared withboth active comparators and placebo, but these did notreach statistical significance in all studies. The averagenumber of patients showing a complete nausea and vomit- ing response was greater with cannabinoids (dronabinol ornabiximols) than placebo (OR, 3.82 [95% CI, 1.55-9.42]; 3trials).

Appetite Stimulation in HIV/AIDS Infection Appetite stimulation in HIV/AIDS was assessed in 4 studies(4 reports; 255 participants). 59-62All studies assessed dron- abinol, 3 compared with placebo (1 of which also assessedmarijuana), and 1 compared with megastrol acetate. All stud-ies were at high risk of bias. There was some evidence thatdronabinol is associated with an increase in weight whencompared with placebo. More limited evidence suggestedthatitmayalsobeassociatedwithincreasedappetite,greaterpercentage of body fat, reduced nausea, and improved func-tionalstatus. However,theseoutcomeswerem ostlyassessed in single studies and associations failed to reach statisticalsignificance. The trial that evaluated marijuana and dronabi-nolfoundsignificantlygreaterweightgainwithbothformsofcannabinoid when compared with placebo. 59The active comparison trial found that megastrol acetate was associatedwith greater weight gain than dronabinol and that combiningdronabinol with megastrol acetate did not lead to additionalweightgain. 60 Chronic Pain Chronic pain was assessed in 28 studies (63 reports; 2454participants). 19,20,22,23,63-120Thirteen studies evaluated nabiximols, 4 were for smoked 5 for nabilone, 3 forTHC oromucosal spray, 2 dronabinol, 1 vaporized cannabis(included 2 doses), 1 for ajuvenic acid capsules, and 1 fororal THC. One trial compared nabilone with amitriptyline 64; all other studies were placebo controlled. One of these stud-ies evaluated nabilone as an adjunctive treatment togabapentin. 121The conditions causing the chronic pain var- ied between studies and included neuropathic pain (central,peripheral, or not specified; 12 studies), 3 for cancer pain, 3for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 2 for fibromyalgia, 2 forHIV-associated sensory neuropathy, and 1 study for each of thefollowingindications:refractorypainduetoMSorotherneurological conditions, for rheumatoid arthritis, for non-cancer pain (nociceptive and central pain (notspecified further), musculoskeletal problems, andchemotherapy-induced pain. Twostudieswereatlowriskofbias,9atunclearrisk,and 17 at high risk of bias. Studies generally suggested improve-ments in pain measures associated with cannabinoids butthese did not reach statistical significance in most individualstudies. The average number of patients who reported a reduc- tion in pain of at least 30% was greater with cannabinoidsthan with placebo (OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.99-2.00]; 8 trials;Figure2 and7 trials assessed nabiximols (Figure 2). Pain conditionsevaluated in these trials were neuropathic pain (OR, 1.38[95% CI, 0.93-2.03]; 6 trials) and cancer pain (OR, 1.41 [95%CI, 0.99-2.00]; 2 trials), with no clear differences betweenpain conditions. Nabiximols was also associated with agreater average reduction in the Numerical Rating Scale(NRS; 0-10 scale) assessment of pain (weighted mean differ-ence CI, 0.80 to severity composite index (WMD,0.17 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.16]; 3 trials), neuropathic painscale(WMD,3.89[95%CI,7.32to0.47];5trials),andtheproportion of patients reporting improvement on a globalimpression of change score (OR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.21 to 3.59];6 trials) compared with placebo. There was some evidenceto support this based on continuous data but this was notconsistent across trials. There was no difference in averagequality-of-life scores as measured by the EQ-5D health sta-tus index (WMD, 0.01 [95% CI, 0.05 to 0.02]; 3 trials)between nabiximols and placebo.

Sensitivity analyses that included crossover trialsshowed results consistent with those based on parallel-group trials alone. Spasticity Due to MS or Paraplegia Fourteen studies (33 reports; 2280 participants) assessedspasticity due to MS or paraplegia. 17,19,65,87,91,122-149Eleven studies (2138 participants) included patients with MS and 3included patients with paraplegia (142 participants) causedby spinal cord injury. Six studies assessed nabiximols, 3 fordronabinol, 1 for nabilone, 4 for THC/CBD (2 of these alsoassessed dronabinol), and 1 each for ECP002A and smokedTHC. All studies included a placebo control group; noneincluded an active comparator. Two studies were at low riskof bias, 5 were at unclear risk of bias, and 7 were at high riskof bias. Studies generally suggested that cannabinoids wereassociated with improvements in spasticity, but this failed toreach statistical significance in most studies. There were noclear differences based on type of cannabinoid. Only studiesin MS patients reported sufficient data to allow summaryestimates to be generated. Cannabinoids (nabiximols, dron-abinol, and THC/CBD) were associated with a greater averageimprovement on the Ashworth scale for spasticity comparedwith placebo, although this did not reach statistical signifi-cance(WMD,0.12[95%CI,0.24to0.01];5trials; Figure3 ). Cannabinoids(nabiloneandnabiximols)werealsoassociatedwith a greater average improvement in spasticity assessedusing numerical rating scales (mean difference, 0.76 [95%CI,1.38to0.14];3trials).Therewasnoevidenceofadiffer-ence in association according to type of cannabinoid foreither analysis. Other measures of spasticity also suggested agreater benefit of cannabinoid but did not reach statisticalsignificance (Table 2).

This reporte daag r e a t e r benefit of nabilone compared with placebo on the sleep apnea/hypopnea index (mean dif-ference from baseline, 19.64; Pvalue = .02). The other was a crossover trial judged at low risk of bias in patients withfibromyalgia and compared nabilone with amitriptyline.This suggested that nabilone was associated with improve-ments in insomnia (mean difference from baseline, 3.25[95% CI, 5.26 to 1.24]) and with greater sleep restfulness(meandifferencefrombaseline,0.48[95%CI,0.01to0.95]).Nineteen placebo-controlled studies included for other indi-cations (chronic pain and MS) also evaluated sleep as anoutcome.* Thirteen studies assessed nabiximols, 1 for nabi-lone, 1 for dronabinol, 2 for THC/CBD capsules, and twoassessed smoked THC (one at various doses).

Only 2studies evaluated cannabis. 59,77There was no evidence that theeffectsofcannabisdifferedfromothercannabinoids. Strengths and Weaknesses This review followed recommendations for rigorous system-atic reviews. 7,8In order to identify as many relevant studies as possible and reduce the risk of publication bias, a highlysensitive search strategy was used and an extensive range ofresources were searched including electronic databases,guidelines, and systematic reviews. Both published andunpublished trials were eligible for inclusion. There were nodate or language restrictions. In order to minimize bias anderrors, the main Embase strategies were peer reviewed by asecond independent information specialist 165and all stages of the review process were performed independently by 2reviewers. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool 11to assess the included RCTs. This highlighted a number of method-ological weaknesses in the included trials including failure toappropriately handle withdrawals, selective outcome report-ing, and inadequate description of methods of randomiza-tion, allocation concealment, and blinding. An additionallimitation of many included studies was their very smallsample sizes. This was particularly the case for the trial ofglaucoma (N = 6), Tourette syndrome (average N = 18), sleepdisorder (average N = 27), and anxiety disorder (N = 24), which means these studies may have lacked the power todetectdifferencesbetweentreatmentgroups. The synthesis combined a narrative discussion of indi- vidual study results with meta-analysis (for studies in whichsuitabledatawereavailable),supplementedbyinterpretation(following guidance of the GRADE Working Group). 14The data analysis was complicated by a number of issues.The included studies used a large variety of measures toevaluate outcomes, and even very similar outcomes wereoften assessed using different measures. Furthermore, awide range of time points were reported in the includedtrials, which limited the applicability of the findings of thesestudies. Multiple different cannabinoids were evaluated inthe included studies. We stratified analyses based on type ofcannabinoid to investigate whether there were differences inassociations based on type of cannabinoid. The majority ofthe studies were 2-group trials with a placebo control group;however, some studies included active comparisons andmultiplegroupscomparingmorethan1formofcannabinoid,different doses of cannabinoids, or active and placebo com-parator groups. This necessitated selecting a single resultfrom each trial to contribute to the meta-analysis to avoiddouble counting of studies. Where possible, we selected theresult for the treatment or dose most similar to the otherstudies contributing to that meta-analysis and for placebo-controlled comparisons rather than active comparisons. Forthe short-term AE analysis, we selected the highest-reportedcannabinoids dose because we hypothesized that this wouldbe most likely to be associated with AEs\u2014additionally, thisanalysis would present a worst-case scenario. Studies evalu-ated various forms of cannabis administered via variousroutes (oral capsules, smoked, vaporized, oromucosal spray,intramuscular injection) and active comparators differedacross trials. These differences in form, combined with thevarietyofoutcomemeasuresandthebroadindicationgroup-ings considered by this review, resulted in a very heteroge-neous set of included studies, which meant that meta-analysis was not always possible or appropriate. Manystudies reported insufficient information to allow meta-analysis (eg, reporting only Pvalues for group differences) or no information on the analysis performed. A further diffi-culty with the continuous data were that even for the sameoutcomes, some studies reported results as differencebetween groups at follow-up and others reported results fordifference in change from baseline. As advised by the Coch- rane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ,w e combined both types of data when estimating summarymean differences. 7A potential problem with RCTs using crossover designs is the possible unblinding due to strongtreatment or AEs. Additionally, studies of this design wererarelyanalyzedappropriatelyandnonereportedtherequireddataaccountingfortheircrossoverdesigntopermitappropri-ate inclusion in meta-analyses. 166Primary analyses were therefore based on parallel-group studies, with crossovertrialsincludedassensitivityanalyses.

Conclusions There was moderate-quality evidence to support the use ofcannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain and spastic-ity. There was low-quality evidence suggesting that canna-binoids were associated with improvements in nausea andvomiting due to chemotherapy, weight gain in HIV, sleepdisorders, and Tourette syndrome. Cannabinoids were asso-ciated with an increased risk of short-term AEs.
