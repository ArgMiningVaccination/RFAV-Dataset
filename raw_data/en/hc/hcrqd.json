Wheeler, PhDHydroxycitrate [(-)hydroxycitric acid, HCA], is a popular component of over-the-counter weight-loss formulations, where it is marketed under the names Citrin (Sabinsa Corp.) and CitriMax (InterHealth Co.) and appears in products such as the Super Prolean Mega Fat Burner. Hydroxycitrate is found in high concentrations in Garcinia cambogia (a plant from India), as well as two other plants of the genus Garcinia, and these plants are used for commercial preparations of the compound. Other names applied to these plants include \"brindall berry\" and \"Malabar Tamarind\" (though strictly the latter refers to a much different species). The reputed effects of hydroxycitrate are ... The reputed effects of hydroxycitrate are based on its action as a potent inhibitor of the enzyme ATP citrate lyase (also known as citrate cleavage enzyme), which is required for the synthesis of fatty acids. The enzyme takes citrate, which has been exported from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, and forms acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate from it. Coincidentally, this inhibitory effect was discovered in the laboratory of my Ph.D. mentor, Dr. John M. Lowenstein of Brandeis University [1]. (Although my own research project did not involve hydroxycitrate, I can remember it being used in other ongoing studies in the Lowenstein laboratory while I was there in the 1970's.) Lowenstein has followed recent developments in the use of his discovery with great interest, and has shared his observations with me; some of his conclusions are presented in this article. In the preparation of this article I am also indebted to Larry S. Hobbs, who devoted a chapter of his book The New Diet Pills (Pragmatic Press, 1994) to hydroxycitrate [2]. Hobbs has corresponded extensively with the major researchers and promoters of hydroxycitrate, and has provided me with a considerable amount of information on the subject. A Literature Review In mid-1995, I performed a search of the medical literature (Medline, National Library of Medicine) covering the period 1983 through May 1995, looking at the key words \"hydroxycitrate,\" \"hydroxycitric,\" \"garcinia,\" and \"cambogia.\" There were no articles found for \"cambogia,\" and those obtained for \"garcinia\" all dealt with species other than cambogia and with compounds other than hydroxycitrate. References obtained for the keywords \"hydroxycitrate\" and \"hydroxycitric\" were nearly all to papers in which the compound was used as a research tool to manipulate metabolism in experimental animals or cell preparations. The only clinical study was a Russian-language article whose translated title was \"Treatment of Patients with Food Toxinfection in Middle and Old Age.\" Thus, there were no studies in the regular medical literature documenting the usefulness of the compound for weight loss in humans. Of the other papers identified in the search, two [3, 4] were review articles coauthored by Ann C. Sullivan of Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc., who was involved in many of the early animal studies. (Hoffman-LaRoche began studying the compound in the 1970's and held several related patents.) These articles, dealing with the general topic of appetite regulation by drugs and other compounds, summarized the results obtained with hydroxycitrate in animals (rats, mice, chickens). The authors proposed that hydroxycitrate acted primarily through its effects on the appetite, possibly involving increases in glycogen levels (see below). The other two articles were published in the journal Medical Hypotheses. One of these [5] briefly discussed the animal studies and described the presence of HCA in fruits of Garcinia species. It also mentioned, with no documentation of methodology, the author's personal success in using the compound for weight loss (claimed to be \"about one pound per day without any dieting\" and accompanied by \"sustained increase in energy\"). The second of these [6] was a much longer article by Mark McCarty. He is vice-president of Nutrition 21, which manufactures chromium picolinate. The article reviewed theories of appetite control, as well as effects of hydroxycitrate and their possible mechanisms (see below). The author proposed that HCA might be combined with carnitine for a weight-loss program, the latter because of its alleged ability to promote fat oxidation - even though he acknowledged \"a lack of clinical studies demonstrating its efficacy\" in weight loss. He further proposed that the addition of chromium picolinate to a hydroxycitrate/carnitine mixture would be even better. A review of this popular \"health food\" item is beyond the scope of this article, but a recent critical review [7] gave reasons to be skeptical of the value of chromium supplements. For one thing, it is difficult to determine whether anyone is chromium deficient, and people who aren't deficient will not benefit from supplements. Also, clinical results supporting the use of chromium in reducing fat have not been replicated. In November, 1996, the Federal Trade Commission announced consent agreements with Nutrition 21 and two other marketers of chromium picolinate. The companies had been charged with making unsupported claims about the benefits of chromium. During final preparation of this article (December, 1996) I updated my literature search. The only new articles relevant to HCA supplements were three more by McCarty in Medical Hypotheses [8-10]. These develop further the ideas that HCA may be useful in promoting fat oxidation and gluconeogenesis (see below). Possible Modes of Action While the ability of hydroxycitrate to block ATP citrate lyase, and therefore fatty acid synthesis, has been established in experimental animals, this alone would not be expected to produce weight loss. First, calories consumed in one form (say, carbohydrates) would not simply disappear because they couldn't be converted to fat; they would be directed to other metabolic pathways (for example, storage as glycogen). Secondly, the major problem in obesity is not that too much fat is synthesized; rather, too much is consumed in the diet. Nevertheless, studies with rats and mice indicate that hydroxycitrate decreases weight gain. (It should be noted that unlike the adult humans for whom the compound is being promoted, these animals continue to grow throughout their life spans. Thus, it was a decrease in weight gain, rather than a loss of weight, which was measured. This difference in growth patterns emphasizes the need for human studies to confirm the effectiveness of the compound.) The most likely mechanism for the decreased weight gain seems to be a decrease in appetite (and animals consuming the compound do eat less), but the mechanism by which hydroxycitrate produces such an effect is unclear. One suggestion is that hydroxycitrate would divert calories toward the synthesis of liver glycogen (a polymer of glucose). Animal studies support increased gluconeogenesis (synthesis of glucose from compounds such as lactate and amino acids) and glycogen synthesis in response to HCA. The resulting increased glycogen, or possibly glucose itself, might then be involved in the satiety signal. However, there is no general agreement on how appetite is controlled, and some experts in the field reject the idea that glycogen is involved. (Related to glycogen, it has been suggested [11] that the increased glycogen could help maintain blood sugar, leading to an increased feeling of \"energy,\" \"for those with glycogen storage problems.\" Since the synthesis and breakdown of glycogen, as well as other pathways controlling the level of blood glucose, are highly regulated processes, there would appear to be no advantage in this respect for normal individuals.) A second suggested mode of action is that hydroxycitrate somehow increases thermogenesis (metabolism of fat or other compounds to produce heat rather than metabolic energy in the form of ATP). Normally, cells only consume fuels when needed to produce ATP; otherwise, the fuels are converted to stored energy in the form of fat or glycogen. However, in brown adipose tissue (brown fat), there is a type of fat consumption in which calories are converted to heat without producing ATP. I am unaware of any reason to think that hydroxycitrate would regulate this process. However, McCarty [6)]advances the thermogenesis hypothesis based on comparisons of reduced weight gain in experimental animals to the reduced food intake, which suggests that extra calories were being disposed of in some way. McCarty also suggests that other metabolic effects could contribute to wasting of ATP, and therefore extra consumption of calories in the presence of hydroxycitrate. For example, gluconeogenesis consumes ATP energy, and if molecules are converted to glucose (and glycogen) rather than to fat, this would consume ATP. This seems unlikely to me. First, there is only a limited capacity for taking up extra carbohydrate in glycogen, so this would not produce much long-term effect on weight. Second, this pathway is also limited by the body's natural regulatory mechanisms; a rise in blood glucose would trigger release of insulin, and this in turn should inhibit gluconeogenesis. Third, converting the pyruvate to glucose would consume less ATP than converting it to fat (the process blocked by hydroxycitrate). (Clouatre and Rosenbaum [11] assert citrate lyase by HCA \"uses up a significant amount of energy,\" but provide no rationale for this claim.) It has also been suggested [6] that HCA, since it inhibits the formation of acetyl CoA in the cytoplasm, would also inhibit the formation of the next compound in the pathway of fatty acid synthesis, malonyl CoA. Malonyl CoA is in turn an inhibitor of the enzyme carnitine acyltransferase, which is needed for oxidation of fat. Therefore, reducing malonyl CoA formation with HCA might stimulate fat metabolism (along this same line of reasoning, provision of carnitine is also proposed to enhance fat metabolism, so that McCarty [6] advocates joint administration of HCA and carnitine). However, as noted above, cells normally only metabolize fuels when they need to produce energy, so if more calories in the form of fat are being consumed, fewer carbohydrate calories will be disposed of. The shift in the relative use of carbohydrate and fat would not by itself result in weight loss unless the resulting increased carbohydrate levels cause a decrease in appetite, as discussed above. Clinical Studies In reading McCarty's article (6), I noticed reference to one \"controlled clinical study\" of HCA by Anthony Conte, M.D. [12], published in The Bariatrician (cited by McCarty as \"Am. J. Bariatric Med.\") This is a specialty publication of professionals dealing with obesity and its associated diseases. Not only is this journal not part of the mainstream medical literature (otherwise it would have showed up in my Medline search), but the article was not a regular peer-reviewed research article. Rather, it appeared as a more informal item under the heading \"How I Do It In My Bariatric Practice,\" a regular feature of the journal. The article describes a double-blind study of 50 obese volunteers, who took Lipodex-2 (containing hydroxycitrate and chromium) or a placebo, along with a special low-fat diet. In the 8-week study period the treatment group lost about three times as much weight as the control group. Hobbs has criticized this study on several grounds. Among his points in Ref. 2 are: - HCA was not tested alone but in combination with chromium. To me, this is not a critical flaw, since if a significant benefit were confirmed, future studies could determine which component is important. Moreover, as noted above, there is as yet no good evidence that chromium is of value. - Conflict of interest - the article is followed by a phone number for the manufacturer of Lipodex-2 . However, many studies of pharmaceuticals are supported by manufactures, and the listing of the phone number seems to have been for informational rather than advertisement purposes. The critical point will be whether the results of the study are replicated by independent investigators. - Based on animal studies, one can calculate that a minimally effective dose of HCA would be twelve times higher than that used in the study. While there is some uncertainty in extrapolating from rats to humans, this does seem like a large difference. Other recent clinical studies (see below) have used about twice as much HCA as Conte's. In unpublished correspondence, Hobbs provided additional criticisms: - The reported weight loss was much more effective than that achieved by prescription diet pills, which seems \"too good to be true.\" - Of the 30 subjects using HCA, including one dropout, only one gained weight (and that was only 0.5 lb), which also seemed unlikely for such a study. - There was no statistical evaluation of the data, nor could statistics be calculated by a reader since individual results were not listed. - In a section entitled \"Long-term health benefits,\" it was stated that \"It reduces blood lipids, stabilizes blood sugar levels,\" but no such results appeared in the study, nor was there citation of other work supporting these claims. Additional points of my own are: - In general, procedures were poorly described. For example, it was not stated how the double-blinding was performed. - In some blinded studies, subjects have been able to guess which group they belonged to because of differences in taste or other properties between test and placebo pills. No data were given which would allow us to tell whether such an effect occurred in this study. - It was stated that the HCA group had greater \"appetite suppression\" and \"level of energy,\" but no information was given on how these were measured or what the differences were. In defense of the Conte article, it does not purport to be a fully-detailed, regular research paper. Informal communications such as this article can be useful stimuli to further research. However, it is reasonable to ask for better doumentation of the methods and results, as well as replication by other investigators, before we can conclude that HCA is an effective agent in weight control. In addition to Conte's study, Hobbs and Lowenstein informed me that other controlled clinical studies have been performed (but not published in full) or are in progress. Two of these have been presented in abstract form. In one [13], a study of 200 subjects, the treatment group received 1500 mg HCA daily, in addition to carnitine and chromium. These subjects lost twice as much weight as controls (all subjects had a low-fat diet and increased exercise). In the second [14], involving 60 subjects, the treatment group received 1320 mg HCA daily. Again, all subjects were on a low-fat diet with increased exercise, and the HCA group lost nearly twice as much weight. In summary, while at least three investigators have obtained clinical data supporting the use of hydroxycitrate for weight control, their results have yet to be documented in regular peer-reviewed publications. It will be important that such studies document the long-term utility of the compound, since many dieters are successful in losing weight initially, only to regain the weight at a later time. Safety In addition to the question of whether hydroxycitrate is effective in weight loss, it is important to ask whether it is safe. Animal studies indicate that the compound is no more toxic than citric acid itself, which is present in many foods in addition to being a normal intracellular compound. Also, HCA is a component of a natural product which has long been used in Indian cooking, as well as for medicinal purposes. Thus, marketers of \"health food\" products using the natural form of the compound need not demonstrate its safety as would be the case for a new pharmaceutical. Nevertheless, it seems wise to ask for data showing that the compound is safe in humans when consumed at the levels being advocated for weight loss. Investigators performing the clinical studies discussed above have, of course, been monitoring their subjects for adverse side effects. But, as noted, none of these has yet to appear as a regular publication in the medical literature. Promotional material for commercial preparations has pointed out some possible concerns. One booklet [11) suggests that since hydroxycitrate can inhibit production of cholesterol and consequently of steroid hormones, its use should be avoided in young children, as well as during pregnancy and lactation. Another booklet [15] points out that increased gluconeogenesis and ketone formation can be deleterious in diabetics (some obese individuals suffer from non-insulin-dependent diabetes), although it was thought that this would be outweighed by the benefits of the putative anti-obesity effects. Promotional Claims In general, promotional literature for weight-loss products containing hydroxycitrate suffers from two major flaws. First, statements are made concerning the effectiveness of the product even though these claims have not been established for humans; rather, they are based on animal or preliminary human studies. For example, we are told that HCA \"inhibits fat production and forces the body to burn fat,\" helps \"prevent excess calories from being synthesized into fat and cholesterol,\" \"gives you more energy while lowering the appetite,\" \"prevents the carbohydrate you consume...from being converted to fat,\" boosts \"the rate the body burns calories and stores fat, and actually controls appetite cravings\"; that \"within 10-15 days you will begin to notice that you have more energy and that your appetite has decreased by 50%\"; and that \"HCA's effects last considerably longer than other diet aids.\" Second, there is inadequate or misleading documentation. The materials often refer to scientific studies (with or without citations) without informing the consumer that these were almost entirely done with animals. An advertisement for Bio-Max 3000 refers extensively to the Conte study, saying it was \"published in a prestigious American medical journal,\" while only in next paragraph noting that the study \"may be preliminary.\" Conclusions Unlike some products being marketed in the area of \"health foods\" and diet remedies, hydroxycitrate has a respectable history of scientific investigation. Its use in weight loss is supported by animal studies, where it appears to act (by a mechanism which is not yet clear) by reducing food intake. Some preliminary data support the effectiveness of HCA in humans, but this has not yet been demonstrated in regular peer-reviewed publications. Dr. John Lowenstein, who pioneered the biochemical studies of the compound, feels that it may be useful in humans, but he is not convinced by the data presented to date. However, in a recent (December, 1996) phone conversation he noted that results of a new clinical trial should be forthcoming soon. Despite the lack of solid data supporting the use of the compound, it is being heavily promoted in the \"health food\" industry, which does not convey the tentative nature of the scientific findings. Consumers should be wary of spending large amounts of money on this product until more conclusive results have been published. Update, July 1999 In 1998, the Journal of the American Medical Association published athe results of a large randomized, controlled clinical trial in which 135 overweight men and women received either hydroxycitrate or placebo along with a high-fiber, Hydroxycitrate was taken three times per day, 30 minutes before meals, for a total daily dose of 1500 mg. The subjects were followed for 12 weeks (compared to 4 to 8 weeks in previous studies). Both groups lost weight (4.1 +/- 3.9 kg (mean +/- S.D.) for placebo and 3.2 +/- 3.3 kg for HCA) (9.0 and 7.0 lb, respectively) and had a reduction in body fat mass (2.16 +/- 2.06% for placebo vs. 1.44 +/- 2.15% for HCA). While the mean losses were actually greater for placebo than for HCA, the differences between groups were not statistically significant at the P < 0.05 level. Using the observed distribution of weight changes, the authors estimated the power of their study. This analysis indicated an 89% probability of predicting differences as small as 2 kg (4.4 lb). Some earlier studies have reported benefits of about this size or greater. In discussing possible reasons why HCA might not have been effective, the authors noted that they tested the compound under conditions in which the subjects were already losing weight. This was because they \"intended to mimic diets commonly prescribed as a component of weight control programs.\" They went on to suggest \"The possibility exists that the lipid synthesis-inhibiting properties of hydroxycitric acid may be more evident in subjects relapsing following a failed diet attempt, particularly if high-carbohydrate foods are ingested.\" Consistent with the previous indications that HCA is relatively safe, there were no differences between treatment and control groups in reported adverse effects. The authors also reviewed seven previous clinical trials of HCA, both published and unpublished. Concerning the studies described earlier in this article (12-14), they noted that Conte [12] had a small sample size and used HCA in combination with other potentially active agents, while Thom [14] had a small sample size and used an \"inaccurate body composition method (near-infrared interactance).\" The other four studies were also summarized: Badmaev, V, and Majeed, M. (1995) \"Open Field, Physician Controlled, Clinical Evaluation of Botanical Weight Loss Formula Citrin.\" Presented at: Nutracon 1995: Nutriceuticals, Dietary Supplements and Functional Foods; July 11-13; Las Vegas, Nev. This was an open label study of 77 subjects (55 completing the trial) in which 500 mg Garcinia cambogia extract (GCE) was given three times a day for eight weeks. About a 5% weight loss was observed. Limitations of the study include lack of blinding and controls; and use of another agent (chromium picolinate), as well as diet and exercise. Ramos, R., Flores Saenz, J. and Alarcon, F. (1996), unpublished data. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 40 obese subjects (35 completing the trial). GCE (500 mg) was given three times per day, along with a low fat diet, for eight weeks. The treatment group lost 4.1 +/- 1.8 kg (9.0 lb) vs. 1.3 +/- 0.9 kg (2.9 lb) for controls (P < 0.05). Rothacker, D.Q. and Waitman, B.E. (1997) \"Effectiveness of a Garcinia Natural Combination in Weight Loss: a Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study.\" Int. J. Obesity 21 (Supp. 2), 53. This was also a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, with 50 obese subjects (48 completing the study) for six weeks. GCE (800 mg) was given three times per day, in addition to caffeine and chromium; the diet was limited to 5040 kJ per day. No significant effect of the treatment was seen, with the treatment group having a 4.0 +/- 3.5% fat loss compared to 3.0 +/- 3.1% for the control group (P = 0.30). This study was complicated by the use of two other agents besides HCA. Girola, M., De Bernardi, M., Contos, S. et al. (1996) \"Dose Effect in Lipid-Lowering Activity of a New with 150 subjects (the number completing the trial was not reported) for four weeks. Here the dose of GCE was much smaller, 55 mg once per day for one group and twice per day for another group. The treatment groups also received two other agents, chromium and chitosan (a treated form of chitin which binds intestinal fat, thus lowering its absorption), also once or twice per day, and all subjects were on a low-calorie diet. Data were expressed as \"overweight reduction\": 12.5 +/- 1.2% for two doses per day; 7.9 +/- 0.9% for one dose per day; and 4.3 +/- 1.0% for placebo. The authors also note, among the limitations of the seven studies, \"failure as of yet to publish study results in peer-reviewed literature in all but 2 of the 7 studes.\" The two exceptions are given as their references 13 and 14, Rothacker and Waitman, and Girola et al., respectively. However, this appears to be an error since Rothacker and Waitman is only an abstract. Conte and Girola et al. are listed as peer-reviewed publications in Table 2 of the paper, so perhaps the comment was supposed to refer to Conte rather than to Rothacker and Waitman. But, as described earlier in this article, Conte's paper does not seem to be a regular-reviewed article, but rather a more informal study. A Medline search (July 3, 1999) indicated that the Thom and Rothacker studies, published as abstracts in International Journal of Obesity, still have not been published as regular papers. Thus, what appears to be the most thorough study of hydroxycitrate obtained negative results. In addition, one other recent study (Rothacker et al.) found results which were not statistically significant. The usefulness of this product remains to be demonstrated.

In 1982, in an article in the National Council Against Health Fraud's newsletter, I attacked some of the fallacies of Harvey Diamond's faddish approach to nutrition. At the time, he was touting \"food combining\" in seminars called the \"Diamond Method.\" I concluded by stating that from a scientific viewpoint this method was \"pure zirconium crystal.\" Little did I suspect that Diamond and his wife, Marilyn, would later produce the fastest-selling diet book in U.S. history: Fit for Life [Warner Books, 1985], which reportedly has 1.8 million copies in print. Since my little expose was published, the Diamonds have polished their act enough to become stars of the TV talk show circuit. Perhaps to enhance their brilliance, Harvey obtained a \"doctorate in nutrition science\" and Marilyn obtained \"certification in nutrition counseling\" from the American College of Health Science (also called the American College of Life Science). This is an unaccredited correspondence school in Austin, Texas, which teaches a naturopathic philosophy called \"Natural Hygiene.\" Environmental Nutrition Newsletter calls Fit for Life \"typical of the new wave of books that intertwine scientific detail with pure nonsense.\" Other best sellers of this type include Life Extension, by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw, Dr. Berger's Immune Power Diet, by Stuart Berger, M.D., and and Eat to Win, by Robert Haas. All of these books have made millions for their authors and their irresponsible publishers, largely as a result of appearances on the Donahue and Merv Griffin shows. Fit for Life's central premise is that nutrition depends more on when and how you eat rather than what or how much you eat. The book has two sections. The first, written in Harvey's \"voice,\" covers the principles upon which the book is based. The second, written in Marilyn's \"voice,\" describes their dietary program and provides recipes and sample menus. In Part I, Harvey maintains that Fit for Life is not a diet but \"a way of eating that can be incorporated into your life-style as a way of life, not as a dogmatic regimen.\" But he promises that those who are \"sick and tired of hassling with their weight\" can learn to \"eat and enjoy it, always feeling satisfied and not deprived, always looking forward to meals, and most important, always maintaining a comfortable body weight.\" Moreover, he offers \"permanent results\" and claims that he lost 50 pounds within a month of being introduced to Natural Hygiene. In Part II, Marilyn presents her testimonial: At the age of 31 . . . I spent much of my time in tears, wondering how I was ever going to feel well enough to get on with my life. No amount of drugs, treatment, or therapy that I had had over the years had done anything to change or improve my situation. In all that time . . . no one ever asked me what I was eating! Harvey did! Natural Hygiene, as Harvey was teaching it, supplied me with answers about my health that I had all but given up on finding . . . I learned that I was in pain and out of energy because I had been overtaxing my system with the wrong kinds of foods . . . When I put into practice the principles Harvey recommended, I lost twenty pounds! In a matter of only six weeks, and for the first time in my adult life, I was proud of and comfortable with the shape of my body. Harvey Diamond says his interest in Natural Hygiene was aroused in 1970 by a man who \"explained in a most concise way why I was fat and why I was having such a struggle losing weight and keeping it off. It all made such sense to me that I was dumbfounded at its obvious simplicity.\" After 3 years of study with this man (who wishes to remain anonymous), Harvey determined that the teaching and practice of Natural Hygiene would be his life's work. According to Diamond, Natural Hygiene has ancient roots, but its modern movement began in the United States in about 1850 with the work of Sylvester Graham and three other medical doctors. During the 20th century, the most prominent promoter was Herbert M. Shelton, D.P., N.D., IN.T., D.N.Sc., who from 1928 to 1981 ran a \"health school\" which included a clinic, laboratory and teaching program in San Antonio, Texas. In An Introduction to Natural Hygiene (1922, 1954, 1963), Shelton said that all medicines are \"poisons\" and that \"any patient who can get well in spite of drugs can get well much sooner and more satisfactorily Hygienically.\" He advised that eating more than one type of food at a meal is undesirable. He claimed that when people are ill, the food they eat will putrefy and ferment instead of being digested. And he claimed that fasting is a safe and valuable method of ridding the intestines of putrefied and fermented foods. Shelton died on January 1, 1985, at the age of 89. Like other cults, Natural Hygiene offers simple solutions to life's complex health problems. In Fit for Life, the main problem addressed is unwanted pounds and the simplistic answer is food combining. The book's food plan calls for eating only fruit in the morning and mostly vegetables during the rest of the day. This could lead some people to make a desirable increase in their intake of vegetables. But according to an analysis by Katherine Mulgrave, a nutrition professor at the University of Maine, the Fit for Life diet is low in calcium, zinc, iron, and vitamins B12 and D. Readers inspired to embrace Natural Hygiene by abandoning modern medical care will, of course, be at even greater risk. On September 21, 1982, the Los Angeles Daily Journal reported that a federal court jury had awarded $873,000 to the survivors of William Carlton, a Los Altos man who died after being on a diet of distilled water for 30 days at Shelton's Health School. According to the article, Carlton had died of bronchial pneumonia resulting from a weakened condition that also caused him to lose 50 pounds during his last month of life. The article also stated that he had been the sixth person in five years to die while undergoing treatment at the school, which closed in 1981. Fit for Life is also based on the ideas of John H. Tilden, M.D., author of Toxemia Explained (1926). According to Harvey Diamond, \"Tilden's book is considered the tour de force in the field of Natural Hygiene\" and explains how \"toxemia lays the foundation for putting on excess weight.\" According to Tilden's theories: - Toxic waste material is retained if the body does not have sufficient energy to excrete it. - Common cooking practices create food that is incompletely digested and leaves a toxic residue. - Accumulated toxic waste causes overweight. Diamond also explains how: - Eating foods in the wrong combinations causes them to rot so they cannot be assimilated. - Combinations such as meat and potatoes, eggs and toast, bread and cheese, or chicken and noodles are \"a contributing factor to why people in this country are dying at age 50.\" - Some foods \"cleanse\" the body while others \"clog\" it. - Eggs rot in the body. - Refined sugars also ferment and produce acids even when consumed alone because refining strips \"every vestige of life\" from the sugar, - Fruits and vegetables, being high in water content can wash and cleanse the body of toxins-but when fruit is eaten at the end of a meal, its absorption is blocked and it ferments. Actually, all sugars, whether refined or present in fruit, are almost entirely absorbed in the small intestine. But Diamond declares that \"fruit should never be eaten with or immediately following anything\" \u2014 a rule he calls \"unquestionably the most important aspect of Fit for Life.\" Actually, fruits contain pectin, which is fermented. If the Diamonds' theory that fermentation products cause obesity were correct, eating fruit would increase obesity rather than cure it! Like most advocates of \"natural\" methods, Diamond repeats a number of \"nature-is-best\" myths. For example, he claims that \"animals in nature are magnificently healthy in comparison to the health that we humans experience\" but that pets and zoo animals develop \"many of the problems of humans.\" The fact is that most animals in nature are infested with parasites and succumb to infections and malnutrition. It is only because predators usually kill sick animals that we don't see them stumbling across the plains and through the jungles. Perhaps it has never occurred to Harvey Diamond that the average American lives much longer than any mammal in the wild. The reason pets and zoo animals develop debilitating diseases is because they live much longer than their wild \"cousins.\" Diamond also claims that many people live well past 100 in various remote areas of the world because they eat \"high-water\" foods. As evidence for this supposed longevity, he cites a 1973 National Geographic article in which Alexander Leaf, M.D., was interviewed following trips to three such areas. (Dr. Leaf is chairman of Harvard Medical School's Department of Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology.) However, in an editorial in the August 1982 Journal of the American Geriatric Society, Dr. Leaf explained how further investigation had revealed that many individuals had been exaggerating their age in order to enhance their social status or to promote tourism. [The American College of Life Science, where Diamond got his \"doctoral\" degree, was formed in 1982 by its president, T.C. Fry, whom Harvey calls \"today's most eminent, active proponent of Natural Hygiene . . . a most brilliant spokesperson for health.\" Although Fry obviously has high native intelligence, he admitted in a recent radio debate that he was a high school dropout. He also told me that viruses do not exist and that it was just coincidence that smallpox and polio epidemics ceased when people were immunized against the viruses that cause these diseases. According to the Life Science catalog (a booklet called Careers in Health):] Whereas medical practitioners look to drugs . . . Life Science presents an entirely different approach. We hold that exuberant and radiant health is normal and natural. We hold that suffering and ailments are abnormal, unnatural and unnecessary . . . Cease to indulge in the causes of disease and disease will not occur. The catalog also claims \"you can become an expert nutritionist in less than a year\" by taking the school's 111-lesson correspondence course. Students can acquire a certificate of proficiency after 32 lessons, a \"bachelor of science degree\" after 58 lessons, a \"master of science degree\" after 84 lessons, and a \"doctor of philosophy degree\" in nutrition science at the end. Presumably flushed with the success of his star pupils, Fry announced this year that tuition for his nutrition course would rise from $875 to $1,250 and that graduates could expect to earn $500 to $1,000 per month from home on a part-time basis. But the future of his school is uncertain. In 1982, the Texas Commissioner of Higher Education ordered Fry to \"cease and desist advertising or otherwise offering degree programs without a Certificate of Authority from this agency.\" Fry replied that his school was exempt from the law because it was a religious institution but later said that it had left the state. In 1986, when it became clear that the school was still operating in Texas and would not stop voluntarily, an injunction was obtained forbidding Fry, the College of Life Science, and the American College of Life Science from using the word \"College\" or granting academic credits or degrees. ______________________ This article was published in the March 1986 issue of Nutrition Forum.

Pollen granules stick to the bees' legs and other body parts as they help themselves to nectar (the precursor of honey) inside the flowers. Pollen products are marketed through health-food stores, multilevel distributors, drugstores, mail-order advertising, and the Internet [A,B,C, D]. Misleading Claims Promoters call bee pollen \"the perfect food\" and stress that it contains all of the essential amino acids and many vitamins and minerals [1]. However, none of these nutrients offers any magic, and all are obtained easily and less expensively from conventional foods.

Misleading Claims Promoters call bee pollen \"the perfect food\" and stress that it contains all of the essential amino acids and many vitamins and minerals [1]. However, none of these nutrients offers any magic, and all are obtained easily and less expensively from conventional foods. The [CC Pollen Company](http://www.ccpollen.com/) of Phoenix, Arizona, has also claimed: It has been estimated that honeybee pollen contains over 5,000 enzymes and coenzymes, many times more than any other food. . . . Enzymes in the body are not only necessary for perpetual healing and digestion but for life itself. Without enzymes, life is impossible. Also, enzymes protect against premature aging. It has been reliably stated that only honeybee pollen contains all known enzymes in perfect proportion and perfect balance. [1] The above statement is erroneous. Pollen does not contain all known enzymes, and even if it did, that would not contribute to human health. The enzymes in plants and other species of animals help regulate the metabolic functions of their respective species. When ingested, they do not act as enzymes within the human body, because they are digested rather than absorbed intact into the body. Bee pollen has also been claimed to improve athletic and sexual performance; slow the aging process; promote both weight loss and weight gain; prevent infection, allergy, and cancer; and alleviate more than 60 other health problems. No scientific study supports any claim that bee pollen is effective against any human disease. The few studies that have been done to test its effect on athletic performance have shown no benefit [2-4]. In the mid-1970s, for example, tests conducted on swimmers and cross-country runners found no difference in performance between those who took bee pollen and those who took a placebo [3]. A six-week study of 20 swimmers published in 1982 found no performance difference [4]. Royal jelly, which is secreted from the salivary glands of worker bees, serves as food for all young larvae and as the only food for larvae that will develop into queen bees. Like bee pollen, it has been falsely claimed to be especially nutritious, to provide buoyant energy, and to have therapeutic properties. Bee pollen and royal jelly should be regarded as potentially dangerous because they cause allergic reactions. People allergic to specific pollens have developed asthma, hives, and anaphylactic shock after ingesting pollen or royal jelly [5-12]. Neurologic and gastrointestinal reactions have also been reported [13,14]. Some cases of asthma and anaphylaxis have been fatal. The potential for serious reactions is widespread because at least 5% of Americans are allergic to ragweed pollen, and bee pollen contains pollen from ragweed or plants that cross-react with ragweed, such as dandelions, sunflowers, or chrysanthemums [15,16]. It has been speculated the presence of these allergens might enable regular users to become desensitized (as would happen with allergy shots). However, the odds of this happening are extremely small. Shots deliver the pollen in significant and controllable amounts, whereas bee pollen taken by mouth delivers unpredictable amounts that get digested [17]. Bees are exposed to various bacterial and chemical contaminants that might be incorporated in products for human consumption [18]. Although both bee pollen and royal jelly contain substances with antibiotic properties, both can sustain the growth of disease-causing organisms and neither has practical use as an antibiotic [19]. Contaminants can also be introduced during processing [18]. In 1995, Montana Naturals International, in Arlee, Montana, had to recall several thousand bottles of a bee pollen/royal jelly/propolis mix because of contamination with lead. Propolis, also called \"bee glue,\" is a resinous substance bees use to construct and maintain their hives. In laboratory tests, propolis has exhibited a variety of interesting antimicrobial and antitumor properties [20]. However, it has little practical use and can cause contact dermatitis and other allergic reactions [21]. Federal Enforcement Actions - In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) obtained a consent agreement barring [American Life Nutrition](https://www.ftc.gov/opa/predawn/F93/aln.htm)and American LifeFarFun, Inc., from making various unsubstantiated claims for its bee pollen and four other products. - In 1992, a federal court ordered destruction of quantities of Bee Alive, a royal jelly and herb combination in honey seized from [Bee-Alive Inc](http://www.beealive.com/)., of Valley Cottage, N.Y. In 1989, the FDA had warned the company that promotional material distributed with a similar product had made illegal statements that the product was useful in treating or preventing chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome, gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, low blood pressure, arteriosclerosis, nervous breakdowns, infertility, impotence, depression, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, anemia, asthma, hemorrhoids, migraine headaches, and other problems. Despite a promise to stop distributing literature making these claims, the company continued to advertise that Regina Royal Jelly could help children resist childhood ailments, \"offers daytime vitality and nighttime tranquility,\" increases mental and physical stamina, and \"seems to improve the immune system.\" Company president Madeline Balletta still promotes Bee-Alive as a \"super-food\" whose users (including herself) have been relieved from severe fatigue [22,23]. - In 1994, the FTC obtained a consent agreement barring [Bee-Sweet, Inc](https://www.ftc.gov/opa/predawn/F95/beesweetinc.htm)., a North Carolina-based firm, from claiming that its products could treat various physical ailments. Its ads had claimed that, \"Studies performed by doctors around the world have shown bee pollen to be effective in treating illnesses from allergies to arthritis, anorexia to overweight, fatigue to arteriosclerosis.\" - In 1992, the [CC Pollen Company](https://www.ftc.gov/opa/predawn/F93/ccpollen.6.htm)and its owners (Bruce R. Brown, Carol M. Brown, and Royden Brown) agreed to pay $200,000 to settle charges that they falsely represented that bee-pollen products could produce weight loss, permanently alleviate allergies, reverse the aging process, and cure, prevent, or alleviate impotence or sexual dysfunction. The company and its owners were also charged with falsely stating that bee-pollen products are an effective antibiotic for human use and cannot result in an allergic reaction. Under the agreement, the company and its owners were prohibited from making all of these claims and are required to have scientific evidence to support any other health-related claims about any other product for human consumption. Some of the false claims were made in \"infomercials\" that were misrepresented as news or documentary programs, even though they were paid ads. During one infomercial, entitled \"TV Insiders,\" host Vince Inneo falsely implied that the program was part of a series of independent investigations. The products offered during the infomercial were Bee-Young, Pollenergy (to \"restore missing energy'), Royal Jelly (\"to keep sexually active at any age\"), President's Lunch, and First Lady's Lunch Bar. The infomercial producer [TV, Inc](https://www.ftc.gov/opa/predawn/F93/tvinc.txt)., signed a separate consent agreement. Although violation of an FTC consent agreement can trigger large penalties, Royden Brown continued to promote bee pollen illegally. In May 1994, S&S Public Relations Inc., of Chicago, issued a letter stating: \"It's allergy season, but many sufferers aren't suffering anymore. They're using Aller-Bee-Gone, bee pollen tablets that are credited with relieving the symptoms of allergies, asthma, and other respiratory ailments.\" The accompanying news release added that Brown's lifetime goal was \"to eliminate degenerative disease worldwide through the use of bee pollen. However, a few weeks later, bee pollen's most colorful promoter died following injuries sustained in a fall. For Additional Information References - Is honeybee pollen the world's only perfect food?

I feel sad that you will regret all the harm you are trying to do in the name of the AMA or that you may really believe all the ignorant stuff you say about things you obviously know nothing and have no training, like nutrition, chiropractic, acupuncture and so on. Just because you have an MD after your name doesn't make you an expert on anything, in fact, you're just relying on the old \"trust in the doctor without question\" routine. People are wising up and asking questions now. Since you are retired, you probably no longer feel the obligation to adhere to the Hippocratic Oath and do no harm, so perhaps you can comfortably lie about whatever you wish to give whatever impressions suit your Committee on Quackery just for kicks with no license to lose. When you lie on your death bed, perhaps you'll feel regret for not having told the truth, or for not having taken the opportunity to check out the benefits of \"alternatives to medicine\" yourself, so that you might not be on your death bed at that moment. And if you feel no remorse when the end draws near, I feel even more sad for you because you never knew a life of peace and contentment, only fear, resentment and falsehoods which became your reality. That is sad indeed. You have accomplished so much in your life and reached so many people. Too bad it couldn't have been for the good of man instead of for evil selfishness. Luckily, you're not at the end of your life yet and you have the opportunity to open that God-given mind of yours and find the truth in between your beliefs. I wish you peace and sanity and pray you find the truth and tell others what a grave mistake you've made, so that you may prevent others from straying down the wrong path and repeating your mistakes. -\u2014- - I've seen what you do and say, and you are very inaccurate in your interpretations of Alternative Health Care. How can you put yourself up as an expert with opinions on professions you were never trained in? The reason you can't understand how any of the alternatives to medicine could work is because you come from a different frame of mind, a different reference point that is not compatible with others outside the allopathic model. Alternative health care givers come from the understanding that there is a higher power that created us and continually gives to us all its properties and actions thus maintaining us in existence. If we were not able to adapt to our environment innately, we would simply not survive. As long as that power is free to control and coordinate the functions of the body through the nervous system as it was designed, we will continue to adapt and thrive in the environment. When the nervous system, our master control center, is interfered with, it cannot function properly nor can anything else that is controlled by that nervous system, which is everything. Malfunction leads to disease, then symptoms, then premature death if the malfunction is not corrected. Covering the symptoms with drugs or cutting out a malfunctioning end-organ does not correct the reason for the malfunction. The nervous system must be free to control all the functions properly, including the immune system and body chemistry which swings our moods. That is why Chiropractors remove the interference to the nervous system by adjusting the spine, that which houses and protects the spinal cord but sometimes impinges the cord or nerve roots when it is misaligned or joints are inflamed. I couldn't begin to tell you how the other health care professions work, because I was never trained in their theories nor studied their approaches. I do know that MDs and DCs have almost the same curriculum until MDs go do rounds when DCs adjust in the clinic, with the exception that DCs cover more anatomy and physiology and less pharmaceuticals. Even though their curriculum is similar, DCs are taught from the standpoint that health comes from the superior innate brain above down, inside out and MDs are taught that the educated brain with the outside in approach creates better living through chemistry. Their premises are different, like apples and oranges. You cannot judge one through the glasses of another. Nor can you solve a problem with the same level of thinking that created it. Surely if you didn't know I was a chiropractor by my email address, you must realize now that I am. I love being a chiropractor and my practice members love getting adjusted. They love seeing that there are DCs out here telling the truth about how their body works and how they can get the most out of it without taking anything out of it or putting anything into it. They love the opportunity to come here and get educated so they are in turn empowered to make informed decisions about their family's health and well-being. It is awesome. Having a BS in Psychology and Music, I felt the need to do something useful with my degree and was blessed when Chiropractic found me. I wish the same for you, that you may find something for the good of the people that turns you on as well. I can't imagine that you can do what you are doing now in good concious unless you are completely ignorant of what you are saying. And for that I can forgive you, despite the fact that I detest ignorance. Even more, I detest ignorance with a big mouth. And you seem to have foot in mouth disease. You really would benefit greatly from Chiropractic care. It's like gravity, it works whether you believe it or not. And since the nervous system controls the endocrine system, you'd get an attitude adjustment as a side benefit. I hope that your eyes are open enough to see even some of what I am saying is true. You may believe I am being hard on you or ignorant of what you do. But I've seen some of your interviews and you give the impression that you are an expert in a position to be trusted and believed. When, in fact, you represent all that is self-serving and/or for the monopolizing AMA in an attempt to derail all the health care which is good for people but is a threat to the sick care you MDs capitalize on. You speak of the allopathic model as though it is scientific and imply that Vitalism is not scientific. That is a fallacy, allopathy is more experimental, invasive, barbaric and less researched than the vitalistic approach of chiropractic, which is the science, philosophy and art of restoring proper spinal and nerve function to obtain health. It is very simple, conservative, non-invasive, effective and well-documented scientifically. You just choose to ignore the documentation that supports the effectiveness of chiropractic and form opinions and publish whatever suits your cause to discredit chiropractic. | |[Hide Full Content](#four-thousand-two-hundred) [Colloidal Minerals: Unnecessary and Potentially Hazardous](https://quackwatch.org/related/dsh/colloidalminerals/) Colloidal mineral promoters would like you to believe that mineral deficiency is a widespread cause of disease.

His widely distributed \"Dead Doctors Don't Lie!\" audiotape [4] quotes from U.S. Senate Document 264: [Erosion and unwise farming methods] have led to mineral-depleted soils resulting in mineral-deficient plants, livestock, and people . . . . .the alarming fact is that food now being raised on millions of acres of land that no longer contain enough of certain minerals are starving us \u2014 no matter how much of them we eat. No man of today can eat enough fruits and vegetables to supply his system with the minerals he requires for perfect health because his stomach isn't big enough to hold them. . . . Laboratory tests prove that the fruit, vegetables, grains, eggs, and even the milk and meats of today are not what they were a few generations ago. . . . It is bad news to learn from our leading authorities that 99% of the American people are deficient in these minerals [74th Congress, 2nd Session, 1936]. The cited quotation is genuine, but it did not, as colloidal mineral promoters usually imply, arise from a government research study. In fact, it is merely a reprint of a baseless opinion piece that originally appeared in the June 1936 issue of Cosmopolitan magazine and was placed into the Congressional record by a Florida senator [5]. Most Americans are not slowly starving to death or dying from mineral deficiency. Some promoters use fraudulent [\"symptomatology questionnaires\"](http://www.colloidal-soil.com/index-13.html) for assessing purported mineral deficiency-related health problems. The test asks more than 1,000 questions about physical and psychological symptoms. As far as I can tell, everyone who takes it will be advised that supplements are needed. The test costs $125 but is free if colloidal minerals are purchased. At present, five mines [6] in Emery County, Utah supply three main manufacturers [7] with bulk quantities of shale leachate that are repackaged and sold as distinct products by a burgeoning network of multilevel distributors. [T.J. Clark & Co.'s](http://www.tjclarkinc.com/) Daddy Dearest 1-9/Blackhawk Mine, which started it all in the late 1920s, is the source of \"BHI Lifeminerals,\" \"Toddy,\" \"Golden Minerals,\" and other product lines. The Clark company controls leases totaling approximately 20 acres and has established major overseas distributorships. In an effort to distinguish itself from a host of recent competitors, it downplays its product's shale origins and has coined the term \"PolyfloraminTM\" (literally \"many plant minerals\") to describe it. Its main rival, [Rockland Corporation's](http://www.trccorp.com/) Body Toddy Mine, opened in 1985 and produces for [American [Body Systems Technology](http://www.bodysystemtechnology.com/), [Source of Health](http://www.sourceofhealth.com/) and [LifePlus](http://www.lifeplus.com/). currently owns 1,000 acres of shale leases in Emery County and a new production/bottling facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Its reserves are estimated to be 320 million metric tons of shale, enough for 950 billion gallons of product. Rockland has no qualms about the source of its products: several color photos of mining operations are prominently displayed on its home page. [New Vision International](http://www.new-vision-intl.com/) and [Nature's Sunshine](http://www.snodgrass-industries.com/vitamins.htm), have refused to disclose the source of the leachate used in their products. In all of the operations, the shale (often referred to as \"a special ancient rainforest deposit\") is mined, crushed, ground to a powder-like consistency, and placed into large stainless steel vats. The vats are then submerged in \"cool, contaminant free water at low temperatures.\" Many distributors stress these conditions to counter claims that acids, solvents, and high temperatures will ruin the minerals' special properties. Unnamed competitors are routinely accused of using such faster methods in order to force mineral extraction. After 3-4 weeks, during which time water-soluble components of the shale enter into solution, the bitter-tasting leachate is siphoned off, filtered and ready for tonic, capsule, and oral-spray production. Depending upon the filtration process used, a variable amount of insoluble particulate matter suspended in the leachate will pass into the final product. Advertisements state that colloidal supplements contain 75 \"minerals.\" Actually they are elements occurring in various mineral forms: Ag, Al, As, Au, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Br, C, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Dy, Er, Eu, F, Fe, Ga, Gd, Ge, H, Hf, Hg, Ho, I, In, Ir, K, La, Li, Lu, Mg, Mn, Mo, N, Na, Nb, Nd, Ni, O, Os, P, Pb, Pd, Pr, Pt, Re, Rh, Ru, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Si, Sm, Sn, Sr, Ta, Tb, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, Tm, V, W, Y, Yb, Zn, and Zr. Some distributors modify their tonics with flavorings and/or nutritional additives, but most sell them straight and emphasize their \"all-natural\" quality. Lots of Hype Wallach's supporters frequently describe him as a Nobel Prize nominee [8]. Actually, he was \"nominated\" in 1991 for his \"research\" on cystic fibrosis by the Association of Eclectic Physicians, a naturopathic group with no scientific standing. His research findings [9] were invalid, because the people he studied were self-selected, and not randomized; he did not follow an appropriate data-gathering protocol; his diagnoses were made with a questionnaire; and his report made claims about other data that were either unsupported or unreferenced. The Nobel Committee gave no credence to Wallach's \"nomination\" and, in an unprecedented move, officially denied that he was ever a legitimate nominee [10,11]. Wallach claims that (a) we are living in a chemical soup and being bombarded by electronic, magnetic, physical, and mental stress that our forbearers did not have to deal with; (b) \"most diseases are symptoms of mineral deficiencies and are virtually 100% preventible; (c) \"the majority of people who die of natural causes, actually die of a mineral deficiency; and (d) \"In fact, most of us are slowly starving to death.\" [4] Presumably, only colloidal mineral supplements can rescue us from these dire straits. Wallach has a down-home manner and is a compelling speaker. During \"Dead Doctors Don't Lie!\" he asks, \"Are these colloidal minerals important? You bet you're life they're important and every time you don't take them in every day, you're chopping off a few hours or a few days of your life.\" [4] He reportedly collects a 25-cent royalty on each of the millions of tapes sold to distributors and customers [3]. John H. Renner, M.D., President of the National Council Against Health Fraud, has accurately characterized Wallach's tape as riddled with distortions, bogus science, and outright lies [3]. The many outlandish statements Wallach has made on his tape and in public lectures include: Since physicians have a life expectancy of only 58 years, how can you trust them with maintaining your health? Actually, physicians have a greater life expectancy (averaging 75-88 years) than the general population [12]. Mercury amalgam used in dental fillings causes multiple sclerosis. Not supported by clinical research. Many Americans suffer from \"malabsorption disease.\" Certain diseases exist in which people have difficulty absorbing nutrients. However, Wallach is referring to a nonexistent condition which, like the long discredited idea of autointoxication, is based on concepts that ignore scientific research on gastrointestinal tract functioning. Cystic fibrosis is preventable and 100% curable in its early stages. This statement is completely unfounded. Five cultures around the world have average lifespans of 120-140 years. The key to their longevity is the consumption of colloidal mineral waters (\"glacier milk\"). No such long-lived cultures exist. Claims to have authored over 70 articles in peer-reviewed journals as well as several medical texts. Searchs of standard indexes have turned up only a handful of publications, nearly all of which are of dubious quality [9,10]. Claims to have performed 20,500 animal and human autopsies while working as a veterinarian in St. Louis. Even if veterinarians and naturopaths were allowed to conduct human autopsies (which they are not), Wallach would had to have performed them at a rate of 6 per day, 5 days a week, for 12 years in addition to his other duties and while authoring his numerous (though unfindable) articles. Standard vitamins are not digested but pass out in the feces still in tablet form. An unsubstantiated anecdote. States that 50% of 70-year-old Americans have Alzheimer's disease. The actual figure for Americans between 65-74 years of age is 3.9% [13]. Claims to have cured cases of porcine Alzheimers. Pigs don't get Alzheimer's disease. Greying hair and facial wrinkles at any age are due to a copper deficiency. Not supported by clinical research. Cardiomyopathy is solely the result of a selenium deficiency. Cardiomyopathy is a group of heart-muscle disorders with several different causes. All aneurysms (over 40 different kinds) are due to a copper deficiency. Not supported by clinical research. Male-pattern baldness is due to a tin deficiency. Not supported by clinical research. Bell's palsy is the result of a calcium deficiency. The usual cause is compression of the facial nerve. Diabetes and hypoglycemia are due to vanadium and chromium deficiencies. Not supported by clinical research. Sodium consumption is unrelated to high blood pressure in humans. As evidence he notes that cows use salt licks, but don't suffer from high blood pressure. Animals use salt licks as needed. Sodium intake affects blood pressure in people who are salt-sensitive. Periodontal disease is the result of a calcium deficiency and is not influenced by the quality of oral hygiene. Not supported by clinical research. All low back pain is due to osteoporosis. An absurd idea; the most common causes are muscle and ligament strains from overexertion. Metallic minerals (i.e., regular vitamins and minerals) are only 8-12% absorbable while colloidal minerals are 98% absorbable. No data support such a claim; the figures appear to have been pulled out of thin air [14]. The human body transports, stores, and uses minerals in colloidal form. This is simply not true; minerals inevitably occur either as mineral salts, compounded with proteins or lipids, or as enzymal and hormonal components. When the extent of Wallach's misstatements became public knowledge, [T.J. Clark & Co.](http://www.tjclarkinc.com/) severed its business relationship with him. Up to that time, Wallach had been claiming that only leachate from Clark's mine was effective in treating mineral deficiencies. After this falling out, however, Wallach revised his \"scientific\" opinion and quickly moved on to find new partners. After additional problems, [Soaring Eagle Ventures](http://www.eagle-min.com/) terminated their ties with Wallach in early 1997 and prohibited any further use of his promotional materials by their distributors. Wallach is currently collaborating with Ma Lan, a Chinese-educated physician whom I suspect is not licensed to practice medicine in the United States [11]. Wallach has also started his own company, [American Longevity](http://www.american-longevity.com/), whose home page depicts him decked out in a cowboy-hat, American flag shirt and a welcoming smile. Beneath him is the company motto, \"If you don't see my face on the bottle you don't know what your getting.\" Promotional literature employed by other colloidal mineral distributors is equally erroneous. Many, for example, confuse the terms element and mineral. Elements are the fundamental constituents of which all substances are composed. Minerals are naturally occurring, homogeneous inorganic substances with a specific chemical composition and characteristic crystalline structure, color, and hardness [15]. Minerals are composed of elements. For example, the mineral silica is composed of the elements silicon and oxygen. Colloidal mineral promoters use these terms interchangibly. They also employ the misnomer \"metallic minerals\" to distinguish (supposedly ineffective) standard supplement products from their \"plant-based\" colloidal minerals. The distinction is a spurious one, because most colloidal minerals in leachate come from the sedimentary matrix of the shale itself (i.e., the very \"metallic minerals\" that these promoters condemn). The main point concealed by all of this hype is that there is absolutely nothing special about colloidal minerals. A colloid is simply any substance whose particle size is small enough to keep it suspended in a liquid or gas, yet large enough to prevent or delay its passage through a semi-permeable membrane [15]. Various promoters disagree about the basic \"science\" behind their supplements. [T.J. Clark & Co.](http://www.tjclarkinc.com/) claims that colloidal minerals \"produce the correct electrical frequencies that are compatible with the electrical frequencies of the brain and nervous system of the human body . . . and attract toxins and heavy metals from the body and flush them out.\" Such statements are pseudoscientific gibberish. Ironically, Clark has accused competitors of employing \"pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo and marketing hype.\" Most of Clark's competitors claim that colloidal minerals somehow strengthen and rejuvenate the body, increase longevity, and boost one's energy level. Most manufacturers also hint that only they have the proper minerals and the secret, patented process that results in an effective product, and that everyone else is a fraud. Clark gives its distributors signed \"certificates of authorization\" as assurance that they've purchased the genuine article. Before splitting from T.J. Clark & Co, Wallach portrayed himself as an \"unbiased expert\" while exclusively promoting the mine in which he had a financial interest [11]. Today, many independent distributors are circulating copies of Wallach's tape minus the final two minutes in which he had specified that Clark's products were the only effective ones. Manufacturers also disagree about the nature of the shale used for leaching. [T.J. Clark & Co.](http://www.tjclarkinc.com/) asserts that its products contain neither humus nor shale, even though it is registered with the State of Utah as a humic shale mining operation [6]. Some promoters claim that the shale deposits were only lightly covered by 20-30 feet of sandstone, \"just enough to protect the deposit, but not enough to cause excessive heat and pressure that would have altered this pure form of the minerals.\" Others state that the ancient forest was covered by thick deposits of sand, mud, and lava that exerted great pressures on the plant matter but did not alter it. All these ideas are either false, inaccurate, or just nonsensical. Despite claims to the contrary, all are deriving their product from a 30-foot thick layer of carbonaceous shale intertwined with bituminous coal that was laid down during the Cretaceous period about 90 million years ago [16,17]. The bituminous rank of the interlayered coals indicates that these formations were subjected to significant pressures and temperatures of at least 100-150\u00b0C for a prolonged period of time [18]. At least one distributor claims that the Cretaceous source material for his company's elixir is a mere 2,000 years old. Distributors rightly assume that health-conscious consumers will find phrases such as \"ancient virgin rainforest,\" \"pristine,\" and capsules and BERRY'D TREASURE flavored leachate drink, boast that their minerals are the same ones that were responsible for the spectacular size of Cretaceous trees and dinosaurs. As advertisements point out, \"This was a time when much of the earth may still have been very much in a 'Garden of Eden' or very rich, vibrant, and pristine state.\" Promoters would like you to believe that if these minerals could produce fabulous prehistoric flora and fauna, then they can provide health benefits for you. Some distributors supply a laboratory analysis of their products [19-24]. Many distributors provide testimonials that people taking colloidal minerals have experienced improvement in such conditions as high blood pressure, heartburn, sprained ankles, AIDS, hair loss, perforated ulcers, rheumatism, pimples, leukemia, and impotence. The use of disease-related testimonials to promote supplement products is illegal. The FDA has proposed to ban OTC sale of colloidal silver products [25]. While it is true that optimal health depends upon an adequate intake of essential nutrients, fewer than 20 mineral-related elements are essential for humans [26-30]. The exact role of other trace elements, as well as our intake of these micronutrients from prepared meals, remains to be clarified [30]. There is absolutely no evidence, however, that mineral deficiency is a basic cause of disease. In fact, available data refutes the claim that our food supply is \"mineral deficient\" and demonstrates that a standard diet generally contains trace elemental quantities far in excess of those supplied by colloidal mineral supplements [19-24,31-33]. Finally, my own search of the medical and nutritional literature databases for the last forty years failed to produce a single study showing that colloidal mineral supplements are useful. Possible Risks Of course, this is not to imply that these supplements are safe for human consumption. The ingestion of unnecessary amounts of all trace elements should be avoided because many are not easily excreted and all can exhibit toxic effects when consumed in large quantity or for an extended period of time [3,34]. More important, however, colloidal mineral promoters seem oblivious to the fact that their products may contain hazardous organic compounds. For example, a daily dose of Doc's Mineral Rocks contains 7.2 mg of unidentified total organic carbon [20]. It is well established that groundwater can leach toxic organic compounds from sedimentary deposits such as coal, shale, and lignite. In many locations, specific geochemical conditions have led to the leaching of toxic organic compounds into potable water supplies with resulting disease. For example: - Links between endemic goiter and the contamination of iodine-sufficient drinking waters with sulfurated hydrocarbons leached from coal and shale deposits in Colombia and the United States [35-37]. - Studies of elevated radon levels in Texas drinking waters have implicated lignites and other hydrocarbon accumulations as the suspected radionuclide sinks [38]. - Suspected links between the kerogen-rich White Speckled Shale in Saskatchewan (Canada) and patterns of Multiple Sclerosis distribution [39,40]. - Suspected links between weathered low-rank coals and shales and the occurrence of an incurable renal disease known as Balkan Endemic Nephropathy [41,42]. - Hypothesized complicity of North/South Dakota lignites and Alaska/Maine/Minnesota with cancer [41]. - Correlations between digestive cancer mortality rates in Missouri and the consumption of drinking water from coal and shale-bearing strata [43]. Colloidal mineral extracts have a distinctive yellow tint, indicating the presence of dissolved organic matter. At least one manufacturer, the [Rockland Corporation](http://www.trccorp.com/), prides itself on its product's dark gold color. Although the concentrations of hazardous organic compounds may be low, long-term exposure and/or accumulation in body tissues might eventually lead to disease. Suspected and proven carcinogens such as PAHs, aromatic amines, and aminophenols result from the partial coalification of aromatic substances in woody plant tissues [41,44,45]. Such compounds can trigger gene and/or chromosomal mutations and altered gene expression, both of which are significant factors in the development of cancer. PAHs also exhibit the ability to modulate signal transduction among cells, which can have serious negative health consequences [46]. In addition to carcinogenicity, shale extracts possess low-order estrogenic properties. Many organic compounds can also contribute to the unwanted activation of the immune system. Since diseases can be caused by multiple factors, adverse long-term effects of colloidal mineral products may not be readily identifiable. Ironically, while the tonics themselves are unregulated, surface water runoff from the mining operations is routinely remediated because of its threat to plant and animal life. Ten of thousands of Americans are currently serving as unwitting subjects in an undocumented test of their safety. Some scientists are especially concerned about the widespread administration of these products to children. Unfortunately, since colloidal minerals are classified as dietary supplements, no safety or efficacy testing was required before they were marketed. Action to prohibit their sale can only be taken if it is demonstrated that the products are adulterated (i.e., toxic), misbranded, or that specific medical treatment claims have been made for them. The first colloidal mineral supplement sold commercially, which [Rockland Corporation](http://www.trccorp.com/) introduced in 1984, was banned because of its toxicity [47]. Called \"Body Toddy,\" it was reformulated, renamed \"Mineral Toddy,\" and currently is marketed as \"Body Booster.\" Reliance on dubious supplements and unfounded health-care opinions delay people from seeking timely medical treatment. They are also a waste of money. The average recommended dosage of most colloidal minerals costs approximately $360 per person per year. Finally, the widespread quackery associated with colloidal minerals undoubtedly deters professionals from examining the subject simply because of the stigma attached to it. There is always the potential that such research might have generated useful information. According to the most recent figures available, mining is Emery County's largest industry, contributing one third of its earnings [48]. Judging from the recent large-scale expansion of mining and processing facilities [16], as well as the statistics of gross sales in the past few years, it appears that colloidal mineral supplements are currently a healthy cash cow. [Soaring Eagle Ventures](http://www.eagle-min.com/) is reportedly grossing $3 million per month; [New Vision](http://www.new-vision-intl.com/) claims to have monthly sales 2-3 times that amount [3]. The products are advertised as a sure track to financial success on hundreds of Internet sites. The sale pitch is always the same: become an independent distributor, work part-time, and earn lots of extra money. New sites seem to pop up overnight like mushrooms, while new applications (colloidal minerals for your pets and garden!) offer more profits. A 16-ounce bottle of leachate purchased directly at the plant in Emery for $12 can net a $20 return in Salt Lake City and upwards of $30+ on the Internet [1,16]. All of this despite an unproven product, potential health risks, false advertising claims and a plague of recent scandals (lawsuits, accusations of watered-down tonics, etc.) [10]. Some colloidal mineral distributors have broadened the scope of their activities. One industrious individual has already begun promoting the latest purported \"health breakthrough\" of the century. [WaterOz](http://www.wateroz.com/) ionic mineral tonics (produced by a \"very technical, revolutionary new process\") will replace colloidal minerals which are as ineffective as \"normal\" mineral supplements. And so the Ship of Fools prepares to sail out from port once again. . . .

Chiropractic: A system of treatment based on the theory that disease is produced by disruptions in the normal flow of a natural life force termed \"Innate Intelligence.\" This life force flows through the nervous system and is disrupted by displacements of the spinal vertebrae called subluxations. Chiropractic manipulation is intended to correct the subluxations allowing the uninterrupted flow of Innate Intelligence to return the body to full health. As practiced currently in the United States, most chiropractic is limited to treating skeletal abnormalities. Chiropractor: A practitioner of chiropractic.

A diagnosis of cancer can transform abruptly the lives of patients and those around them, as individuals attempt to cope with the changed circumstances of their lives and the strong emotions evoked by the disease. While mainstream medicine can improve the prospects for long-term survival for about half of the approximately one million Americans diagnosed with cancer each year, the rest will die of their disease within a few years. There remains a degree of uncertainty and desperation associated with \"facing the odds\" in cancer treatment. To thousands of patients, mainstream medicine's role in cancer treatment is not sufficient. Instead, they seek to supplement or supplant conventional cancer treatments with a variety of treatments that exist outside, at varying distances from, the bounds of mainstream medical research and practice. The range is broad \u2014from supportive psychological approaches used as adjuncts to standard treatments, to a variety of practices that reject the norms of mainstream medical practice. To many patients, the attractiveness of such unconventional cancer treatments may stem in part from the acknowledged inadequacies of current medically-accepted treatments, and from the too frequent inattention of mainstream medical research and practice to the wider dimensions of a cancer patient's concerns. Unconventional cancer treatments have received only cursory examination in the research literature, making an objective assessment of their efficacy and safety exceedingly difficult. Recognizing this, the Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, John Dingell, asked OTA to review the issues surrounding unconventional treatments: the types of unconventional cancer treatment most available to American citizens and how people access them, costs and means of payment, profiles of typical users of unconventional treatments, legal issues, and the potential for enhancing our knowledge about the efficacy and safety of these cancer treatments. A group of Members of Congress, led by then-Congressman Guy Molinari, also asked OTA to examine a particular unconventional treatment \u2014Immuno-Augmentative Therapy \u2014and to design a clinical trial protocol to permit valid evidence of efficacy and safety to be gathered. All these topics are covered in this report. The debate concerning unconventional treatments is passionate, often bitter and vituperative, and highly polarized. To ensure that all relevant voices were heard and that OTA was accessible, particularly to advocates of unconventional treatments, OTA took several unusual measures during the course of this assessment in addition to its normal process of analysis and review. The project advisory panel, representing a diversity of views, played an important role. Under its Chairperson, Professor Rosemary Stevens of the University of Pennsylvania, the panel persevered through difficult discussions and provided valuable counsel. Much of the final meeting of the advisory panel was organized to hear from critics of the draft report, who were invited by OTA to present their concerns to the advisory panel and OTA staff. OTA's standing Technology Assessment Advisory Council devoted a meeting to this assessment, discussing the science and policy issues related to unconventional cancer treatments and providing counsel to OTA. Many other individuals and groups in the public and private sectors also contributed their ideas and criticism, for which they are gratefully acknowledged. As with all OTA assessments, however, responsibility for the content of the report is OTA's alone and does not necessarily constitute the consensus of the advisory panel, the Technology Assessment Board, or the Technology Assessment Advisory Council. If history in this area is predictive, some few unconventional treatments may be adopted into mainstream practice in the years ahead, others will fade from the scene, and new ones will arise. The ways described in this report to stimulate the valid assessment of unconventional treatments could give the medical community and patients the means to make more informed decisions about their use.

Introduction Each year, thousands of U.S. cancer patients use treatments that fall outside the generally understood bounds of mainstream medicine. While the majority of cancer patients do not use such treatments, those who do represent a visible minority (though the exact numbers are unknown). Additional thousands may be interested in such unconventional treatments and seek information about them. Although any examination of unconventional cancer treatments will fall short of capturing all the reasons for cancer patients' interest in them, certain factors seem clear. Effective treatments are lacking for many cancers, especially in advanced stages; many mainstream treatments entail considerable toxicity; and long-term survival may be uncertain even after apparently successful treatment. These realities of mainstream treatment, coupled with explicit or implicit promises of effective, nontoxic cancer control by unconventional means, and the strong support of cancer patients for them, motivate new patients to seek treatments outside the mainstream. Unconventional treatments vary greatly in content, and range from some that may be used easily along with mainstream treatment to those that, either because of the nature of the treatment, or because of the stance of the practitioner offering them, are used exclusive of mainstream medicine. They also range from those that are entirely within legal rules and ethical assumptions to practices that rely on drugs and biologics that are not approved and are not within the bounds of U.S. law. Additionally, regardless of the nature of the approach taken, patients seek not only a hopeful prognosis, but also treatment perceived as humane and caring and psychological support from caregivers and fellow patients. These are elements that at least some patients believe are missing from mainstream medicine. Another important aspect is the sense of personal control that may be gained from deciding on a course of treatment and pursuing it, sometimes in defiance of physicians, family, and friends. \"Unconventional treatments\" \u2014to use the phrase chosen for this report to describe treatments outside of mainstream medical practice and research \u2014are not limited to treatments for cancer. They are of considerable public interest in the United States, but their use has received little formal study. The range of treatments offered, the people who offer them, the number and types of patients who use them, and their costs are largely undocumented. The reliability of information on the effectiveness and safety of these treatments is questioned by most mainstream medical authorities, in part because most reports are anecdotal or represent unsupported claims of practitioners. Research and clinical studies of unconventional cancer treatments generally have not been well designed and have not met with the approval of academic researchers. Supporters of unconventional treatments tacitly approve these reports in the absence of anything better. Thus, one of the major rifts separating supporters of unconventional treatments from those in mainstream medical care and research is a distinct difference in what they accept as evidence of benefit. Objective, informed examination of unconventional treatments is thus difficult, if not impossible, in the United States today. Acrimonious debate between the unconventional and mainstream communities reaches well beyond scientific argument into social, legal, and consumer issues. Sides are closely drawn and the rhetoric is often bitter and confrontational. Little or no constructive dialog has yet taken place. In the course of this study, OTA involved individuals with a wide spectrum of views about unconventional and mainstream treatments, and went to great lengths to open the process to allow all viewpoints to be aired. This spectrum was represented on the advisory panel as well as among the hundreds of outside providers of information and reviewers who took part in the study. It is fair to say, however, that, while OTA heard and reported the viewpoints, the process did not bridge the gulf between two highly polarized positions. This report describes the unconventional cancer treatments that are most used by U.S. cancer patients; it describes the way in which people find out about them and how much they pay for them; reviews the claims made for them and the information base in support of the claims; suggests possible ways of generating valid information about their safety and effectiveness; and presents the legal issues surrounding unconventional treatments that have brought civil and criminal litigation to bear on the subject. We focus on unconventional cancer treatments, and not on the successes and failures of mainstream medicine, either in general or in treating cancer. To help describe the context in which unconventional treatments exist, however, a brief summary of the status of mainstream cancer treatment is included later in this chapter. But this report is neither a comparison of mainstream and unconventional treatments nor an equal critique of both. In many places, the discussions of unconventional treatments in the report are quite critical, e.g., of the quality of evidence offered to support the treatments, of the claims that are made, etc. In addition, adverse effects are pointed out when there is information about them. These points are not intended to suggest that mainstream medicine is free of faults, that its promise is always realized, or that practitioners of mainstream medicine are aware of and use the best possible treatments for their patients. OTA and many other organizations and authors have produced critical analyses of various areas of mainstream research and medical practice, and these are available for the reader. The aim of this report, rather, is to produce an assessment of unconventional treatments, as far as is possible today. Request for the Study This report responds to a request by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce (a committee with jurisdiction over a wide range of health issues), which asked OTA to examine the subject of unconventional cancer treatments. OTA also received letters signed by 42 individual Members of Congress, asking for an assessment of a particular treatment, Immuno-Augmentative Therapy (IAT). Their request was sparked by the closing of the IAT clinic by the Bahamian government in late 1986. Then-Congressman Guy Molinari of New York, among whose constituents were a number of clinic patients, asked his House and Senate colleagues to cosign letters of request to OTA concerning IAT. In response to the congressional interest, OTA undertook, as part of this project, a case study to develop a protocol for a clinical trial to study the efficacy and safety of IAT. The results of this effort are reported in chapter 6. The Terminology of Unconventional Cancer Treatments \"Unconventional\" is just one of many terms, all imperfect descriptors, that were considered, for the purposes of this report, to refer to the wide variety of treatments that fall outside the bounds of mainstream medicine. Other terms used by proponents to describe all or some of these treatments include: alternative, complementary, nontoxic, holistic, natural, and noninvasive. Those used by the sharpest of critics include: unproven, questionable, dubious, quackery, and fraudulent. At the beginning of this study, the term \"nontraditional\" was used to describe the treatments, but was unacceptable since \"traditional\" is widely used to refer to various types of native healers and treatments, as in traditional Chinese medicine; nontraditional, therefore, could describe mainstream medicine. During much of the project, the adjective \"unorthodox\" was used, chosen as a term as free as possible from value judgments about the quality of the treatments being discussed. Eventually, protests from both sides of the debate prompted the change to the term \"unconventional.\" We intend no implicit message in the use of the word \"unconventional\"; it was chosen with the hope that debate engendered by this report could center not on that word, but on the issues themselves. Historical Perspective Physicians and the organizations they have created have come to dominate health care and biomedical research in the United States during the 20th century. \"Scientific medicine\" owes much of its rise to major advances in public health: the success of vaccination in preventing infectious diseases; the advent of therapeutic radiation for a wide variety of diseases and for its diagnostic uses in the early part of the century; and the successful treatment of previously life-threatening infections with antibiotics in the period after World War II. Evaluation methodology developed alongside potential clinical advances, as the need to distinguish the effective from the ineffective took on greater significance. In addition, the rising toll of chronic diseases \u2014with longer and more unpredictable courses \u2014in the face of dramatically declining death rates from acute diseases heightened the need for reliable methods to gauge the effectiveness of treatments. A formal set of procedures, consistent with the \"scientific method,\" now governs the clinical evaluation of new medical technology, particularly drugs and biologics. (In contrast, medical and surgical procedures \u2014e.g., surgical operations and diagnostic techniques \u2014are not always subject initially to such rigorous testing. (see footnote 1) The formal approach has had particular emphasis in the evaluation of cancer treatments, and over the years has been incorporated into the processes and standards of evidence required by the Federal Government for the approval of new drugs and medical devices, and into the operations of the National Cancer Institute, which funds most cancer research in the United States. The greatest emphasis in cancer treatment, hence in the methods employed in cancer research, has been placed on finding treatments that directly kill cancer cells (cytotoxic agents). The American Medical Association (AMA) has been the organizational leader of the U.S. medical community during this century. In addition to enhancing the authority of physicians and supporting the structured approach to clinical research, the AMA has attempted to eliminate alleged health fraud, and much of this activity has focused on cancer treatments. From the early 1900s onward, the task of combating activities designated as health fraud was the formal responsibility of one or another organizational unit within the AMA. In addition, Morris Fishbein, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) from 1924 to 1949, conducted several crusades against particular practitioners of unconventional cancer treatments and, in general, against what he considered quackery. In recent years, the AMA has reduced its formal activities against certain nonphysician providers and alleged health fraud. While the Division of Archival Services and Public Affairs now answers inquiries about unconventional medicine, the Committee on Quackery and the Department of Investigation were eliminated in 1975. One of the main functions of the Committee on Quackery, formed in 1962, was to oppose recognition of chiropractors as legitimate health care providers. In the mid-1970s, Chester Wilk and three other chiropractors brought suit, charging that the AMA and several other professional societies had engaged in a conspiracy to boycott chiropractors (960). In 1987, after an 11-year lawsuit, the court ruled for the chiropractors and against the AMA (614). Both the Department of Investigation and the Committee on Quackery were eliminated in a 1975 restructuring of AMA. The American Cancer Society (ACS) has also played a key role in defining the limits of orthodoxy in cancer treatment and in discouraging the use of treatments falling outside their definition. ACS has taken a leading role in efforts against practitioners of unconventional cancer treatments. Their \"Unproven Methods List\" is frequently used by doctors in counseling their patients about unconventional treatments, and is used extensively by the insurance industry to determine whether patients should be reimbursed for the costs of treatment (577). It is often referred to as a \"black list\" by the proponents of unconventional treatment. A highly polarized situation exists today. As Lerner puts it: In the \"war over cancer therapies\" that has been widely publicized in the American media for the past decade, both sides often describe the opposition as a malevolent monolith. Thus the cancer establishment has characterized the alternative and adjunctive cancer therapies as the work of quacks preying on desperate and credulous cancer victims, while the proponents of alternative therapies have depicted established therapies as the \"cut, burn and poison\" therapies of a cynical and profit-driven conspiracy. These stereotypes are, from a sociological perspective, familiar to anyone who has studied the phenomenon of propaganda in conflict situations. Each side in the cancer therapies controversy accuses the other of being profit motivated, of preying on desperate cancer patients, of cynically suppressing or ignoring therapies that could be beneficial, and of representing an organized conspiracy to thwart progress in cancer (528). Legal Issues The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and other laws regulate the manufacture, sale, and advertising of medical products. In enacting these laws, Congress has operated on the premise that the Federal Government has a legitimate interest in protecting the health of its citizens, while at the same time respecting their freedoms. The system that has developed is one that requires reliable evidence of efficacy and safety accepted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before medicines may be offered legally. (see footnote 2) This status quo is supported by the \"consumer protection\" point of view. Opposition to this system, called the \"freedom of choice\" position by some advocates of unconventional cancer treatment, is based on a belief that Americans should be free to decide for themselves which treatments they want to take. The \"consumer protection\" point of view is supported by the contention that the average consumer cannot be expected to make informed choices in a complex scientific field. In an early court case under the Food and Drugs Act of 1906, the judge, in his charge to the jury, said: This law was not passed to protect experts especially, not to protect scientific men who know the meaning and value of drugs, but for the purpose of protecting ordinary citizens (914,916). In a case interpreting the 1938 FDCA, Justice Frankfurter stated: The purposes of this legislation...touch phases of the lives and health of people which, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. The argument for \"freedom of choice\" in medical care is based on the concept of an individual's right of privacy. It is argued that this right prohibits the government from restraining individuals' rights to obtain treatments of their choosing: \"the patient should be permitted to opt for treatment consistent with his views of higher quality of life\" (416). A parallel argument is made for the physician's right and responsibility to provide medical care. It reasons that well-informed physicians, following their best judgment and having assessed the risks and benefits of a treatment, should be allowed to provide the care they deem best for their patients (950). There are, in general, no legal restrictions on a U.S. patient's right to choose a treatment for himself or herself, either in the United States or in foreign countries (though parents choosing treatment for a child may be restricted by legal precedents). However, some treatments are excluded from choice in the United States because they involve the use of unapproved substances that could only be offered illegally here. Variations on the freedom of choice position have been voiced in recent years. For instance, during the lengthy legal battles over the rights of cancer patients to use laetrile, the argument centered on the right of terminally ill patients to choose a treatment that did not meet the safety and efficacy requirements of the FDA. In the final decision of that case, which initially found for the plaintiffs at the Federal district and appeals court levels, the U.S. Supreme Court found that even terminally ill patients should be protected from potentially unsafe and ineffective medicines (918). The same case indirectly legitimized the autonomy of the FDA, which had been under siege by State legislatures who were independently permitting the use of a federally unapproved treatment within their States, when FDA regulation clearly prohibited State sanctioning. Laws and regulations designed to protect patients from potentially harmful and ineffective treatments have been criticized by supporters of unconventional treatment for limiting patients' access to treatments of their choice. When State laws have been passed permitting access to specific unconventional cancer treatments that would otherwise be illegal (e.g., laetrile, in the 1970s), they have been criticized by segments of the mainstream medical community for exposing patients to hazardous or ineffective treatments, or for dissuading patients from seeking potential curative treatment. Relevant laws and regulations address the approval, labeling, advertising, and marketing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices; the certification of various types of medical practitioners; professional sanctions against certified practitioners for inappropriate care of patients; the general exclusion of uncertified individuals from medical practice; and the rules by which publicly funded programs pay for medical care. More generally, criminal and civil statutes, though developed to apply to a wide range of situations, sometimes have applied to disputes involving unconventional cancer treatments. U.S. laws provide for the regulation of the efficacy, safety, advertising, and sale of medical drugs and devices, under statutory authority of the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, and the U.S. Postal Service. Professional standards apply to the practice of medicine and are designed to limit the bounds of medicine to practices with known or definable safety and effectiveness, or practices that are generally \"accepted\" by mainstream medicine, sometimes without formal evidence. Though the threat of professional sanctions exists, physicians appear to have considerable latitude in treating their patients; there are relatively few medical conditions for which the choices of physicians are entirely constrained. In addition, the enforcement of laws and professional norms is incomplete, so that, in practice, even set bounds are readily exceeded without legal or professional consequences to the physician. The potential for legal action exists against those overstepping the bounds of law, but relatively few actions are actually taken by the Government or by disciplinary bodies. A member of the advisory panel for this study reported to OTA that, based on an informal survey he conducted, it appears that in the last three years an increasing number of disciplinary actions against unconventional practitioners may have taken place (219). In addition, at least some physicians with an interest in using unconventional treatments along with mainstream treatments have informed OTA that they are reluctant to do so because of the fear of legal action or professional sanctions (82,218). This report describes the legal standing of unconventional treatments and their practitioners and the legal arguments on both sides of the issue. Laws and regulations affecting unconventional cancer treatments are discussed in chapter 10. Those that affect practitioners are discussed in chapter 11. It was not within the purview of the report to suggest an overhaul of the basic regulatory framework for drugs, and options that would accomplish that change are not included. However, the information in the report might be useful in considering a suggestion made in a joint letter to OTA by several members of the project advisory panel, should the Congress wish to consider changes. The panel members believe that it would be useful: To find appropriate mechanisms in the Congress for thoughtful review of the fundamental issues raised by the \"freedom of choice\" versus \"consumer protection\" quandary, and to determine whether there are not better laws and regulations that would enhance both consumer protection and freedom of choice in the interests of Americans with cancer (8). International Perspective on the Availability of Unconventional Cancer Treatments in the United States The FDCA codifies standards of safety and efficacy for new medical drugs and medical devices, but does not set standards for the practice of medicine; the medical profession sets its own standards for the conduct of physicians. A wide variety of unconventional cancer treatments are available in the United States despite the limits implied by these laws and professional standards. A book published in 1988, Third Opinion (289), lists 60 clinics and physicians in the United States offering alternatives to mainstream medicine. Advocates of unconventional cancer treatments often contrast the situation in the United States to the relative openness of a number of European countries \u2014 e.g., Switzerland, Germany, England, the Netherlands \u2014to unconventional medicine. No thorough international comparison of the availability and legal status of unconventional cancer treatments has been done, and OTA did not undertake such a comparison. However, it is clear that many treatments not available legally in the United States are offered openly and legally in those countries. In those countries, it appears that, particularly for treatments that are supportive and adjunctive to mainstream treatment, they coexist more harmoniously with the mainstream community than is the case in the United States. For example, the Bristol Cancer Help Centre, in England, which offers a range of supportive psychological and nutritional approaches, has many cancer patients who were referred there by their physicians. Such programs exist in the United States, the Commonweal Cancer Help Program, for instance; the issue of differential treatment internationally is not simply one of legality, but of acceptance. Some unconventional treatments about which OTA has specific information are not in fact treated equally to mainstream medicine in other countries. In the case of IAT, for instance, though it is available at a clinic in West Germany, it is not licensed by that Government. According to an official of the German Government (422), the \"effectiveness of the method described [in the patient brochure] is not proven by the statements advanced. Whether the treatment can lead to risks for patients is, from the submitted information, not clear, but cannot in any way be excluded\" [emphasis in original]. The costs of treatment with IAT are not covered by social insurance carriers for German citizens. In other countries as well, unconventional treatments are not necessarily paid for by publicly funded health plans (e.g., the Netherlands (222)). In a joint letter to OTA, members of the advisory panel for this study commented on the \"broad availability of insurance coverage in other countries, such as Germany, for many unconventional cancer therapies.\" Defenders of the U.S. drug approval system point to the many instances in other countries, Great Britain, for example, in which drugs never approved in the United States have been approved, later to be banned because of serious side effects not detected during pre-approval clinical studies (966). It is likely that more unsafe as well as ineffective products are approved in countries other than the United States. No comparative analysis of international drug laws as they relate to unconventional medicine exists so it is not possible to draw conclusions about the relative merits and deficiencies of each approach. Current Mainstream Treatments for Cancer Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy (drug therapy), hormonal therapy, and immunotherapy are the main tools of conventional cancer treatment. Surgery is the oldest and still most effective mainstream treatment for solid tumors, and is curative in many cases of localized cancer in which all or nearly all cancerous tissue can be removed. When used with chemotherapy, radiation, or both, surgery's aim is to remove as much tumor as possible without disabling the patient, so that the other treatments have a greater chance of successfully eliminating the remaining tumor cells. In advanced stages of cancer, surgery is sometimes used for palliative purposes, to alleviate the physical interference of a cancer with other organs. Advances in oncologic surgery include a move toward less radical operations for some cancers, particularly early stage breast cancer. The shift is based on the results of large randomized clinical trials of various degrees of surgical removal (from removing the least amount of tissue, \"lumpectomy,\" to the most, radical mastectomy), which demonstrated that, combined with appropriate adjunctive treatment, surgery that is less radical results in survival equivalent to that of more radical surgery. Another trend has been toward more aggressive surgical removal of metastatic tumors. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are used as primary treatments for some leukemias and lymphomas, and are used in addition to (\"adjuvant\" to) surgery for solid tumors that have advanced beyond their original location, including both regional and distant (metastatic) spread. Out of the thousands that have been tested, a relatively small number of drugs (about 30) are approved for use today. The regimens considered \"state of the art\" vary according to the site of the cancer, in some cases the type of cells that make up the tumor, the stage of the cancer, and, to some extent, characteristics of the patient. General rules for mainstream cancer chemotherapy are that the highest tolerated doses be used, and that multiple drugs be used in combination. The use of high doses, the systemic administration, and the toxic properties of many anticancer drugs account for the often severe side effects of cancer treatment. The rules are based on the observation that some cancer cells are resistant to the effects of some drugs. One of the most widespread mechanisms of naturally occurring drug resistance is a molecular \"pump\" which works to transport chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cancer cell before any damage takes place. A number of other mechanisms are known, though all drug resistance is not explained with current knowledge (252). If clones of resistant cells proliferate, there is little hope for control with existing chemotherapy. The emergence of resistant clones and regrowth of drug-resistant cancers is a particular problem after treatment with lower than optimal doses of chemotherapy. Efforts to improve the success of chemotherapy include developing means of more specifically targeting the drug to the tumor, and devising ways of increasing the doses. An example of the former is linking cell-killing agents to monoclonal antibodies that are attracted to specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells. When the \"conjugated\" molecule is administered, it will not find appropriate sites on most normal cells to which it can attach, but will link to cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is another approach still under development to provide localized cancer treatment, though its use is still quite limited. PDT capitalizes on the greater attraction of \"hematoporphyrin\" molecules (the \"sensitizer\") to tumor tissue than to normal tissue, though the basis of the attraction is not well understood. Some time after the sensitizer is administered, the area of the tumor is illuminated with light of a particular wavelength, either from the surface or from inserted fiber optics. The light provides energy for a chemical reaction that results in the release of oxygen, which kills cancer cells by damaging them physically. [Update note: In 1995, PDT received FDA approval for esophageal cancer palliation, and an FDA advisory committee has recommended approval for treating early stage lung cancer.] Hormonal treatment has been successful for types of cancer that are \"hormone dependent,\" notably breast and prostate cancers. The theory behind hormonal, or endocrine, therapy, is that hormones produced internally are \"blocked\" by drugs. These drugs bind to receptors on the surface of tumor cells where the hormones would normally bind, but they do not cause the cell to grow or replicate. These drugs are generally taken for long periods of time following surgery to prevent metastatic disease. Radiation therapy is used most often as an adjunct to surgery, and may be used before or after surgery in different situations. It is also used as a palliative measure, to reduce the pain of bone metastases and to shrink tumors in other parts of the body. Radiation may be applied at or near the site of the tumor as an implant (by insertion of a radioactive isotope) or it may be delivered to the site of the tumor by a high-energy x-ray generator (teletherapy). (Whole-body irradiation is used to intentionally destroy the bone marrow of patients being prepared for bone marrow transplantation.) It is thought that the main effect of ionizing radiation on cells is to interfere with the capacity of the DNA molecule in the nucleus to reproduce, but cells may be harmed in other ways as well. In general, therefore, it is at the time the cells are dividing that they die. Since ionizing radiation also affects normal cells, the dose must be modulated to achieve the greatest antitumor effect while attempting to minimize effects on normal tissue, to optimize the \"therapeutic index.\" The use of radiation therapy began early in the 20th century, preceding chemotherapy, and preceding the wide- scale use of randomized clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of medical treatments. It is only in recent years, therefore, that radiation therapy has been subjected to rigorous evaluation. It is likely that radiation has been used routinely beyond its effectiveness for many types of cancer; valid evidence for these practices still is being gathered. Advances in radiation therapy have centered on more precise delivery systems and on attempts to pair radiation with specific chemotherapeutic agents to enhance their effectiveness. \"Biologic therapy,\" the most recent approach in conventional cancer treatment, refers to \"cancer treatment that produces antitumor effects primarily through the action of natural host defense mechanisms or by the administration of natural mammalian substances\" (763). Though biologic treatments for cancer are relatively new, the field of biologic therapy, also called \"biotherapy,\" developed from observations and experimentation in the late 19th century, which suggested that an immune response could effect tumor regressions (215). Biotherapy is based on the principle that tumor cells are immunologically \"different\" from normal cells, and that the immune system, which has developed to protect against \"nonself,\" can be manipulated to destroy cancer cells. Mainstream biologic therapy includes a number of approaches. One line of development has been to attempt to induce reaction in the patient's own immune system, either with nonspecific stimulators (e.g., Bacillus Calmette- Guerin; BCG) or, more currently, with stimulators related to the tumor itself. The latter includes efforts to develop \"tumor vaccines\" that would cause the body's immune system to activate against tumor cells. Another approach is to inject the patient directly with immune system products and cells (e.g. \"lymphokine-activated killer cells\"). \"Cytokines\" (soluble proteins produced by certain immune system cells), particularly the interleukins, have been the focus of considerable attention in the last few years. Another group of cytokines, the interferons, was studied intensively throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Many of the biological treatments that have been tried have produced some encouraging effects in cancer patients, but, as of yet, few are of lasting benefit to patients. Research in biological therapy is geared toward increasing understanding of immune function and on developing effective ways to apply these tools in conjunction with other forms of cancer treatment. The trend toward increased participation by patients in decisions about their medical treatment has affected mainstream medicine. Whereas in the past few people would have questioned the recommendation of a physician, questioning has become common, perhaps even the norm. In addition, public discussion about health and disease, including all aspects of cancer, has risen, and the level of detailed coverage of cancer by the press has grown continuously. Patients and their families openly discuss the disease. During the 1980s, patient support groups, many independent of organized medicine, have taken hold, and patients have much greater opportunities to exchange information about their treatments. The participation of patients in decisionmaking about their treatment and their more active questioning of medical authority have also raised awareness of the importance of the quality of cancer patients' lives. A panel evaluating the measurement of progress against cancer(896) strongly emphasized the various dimensions embodied in \"quality of life\" as being aspects of the impact of cancer on which systematic data should be collected on a nationwide basis. Such dimensions include: physical side effects (of treatment) such as nausea, general health conditions, and pain; functional status including self-care (eating, dressing, and bathing), mobility, and physical activities such as walking and doing household chores; psychological morbidity including emotional distress, anxiety, and depression; and social interaction including everyday interpersonal contacts, social support, and the work role. Controversies in Mainstream Cancer Treatment During the past few years, the rates of success of conventional cancer treatment have increasingly been examined, debated, and subjected to criticism by both scientists and the general public. Attention has focused on the lack of substantial progress in successfully treating the most common and life-threatening types of cancer. While the last few decades have seen undisputed success in treating a number of cancers \u2014particularly those affecting children and young adults \u2014the gains in survival for most solid tumors (lung and colon cancer, in particular) are small or nil. The long-term survival advantage of some established treatments, particularly the treatment of early stage breast cancer, has been demonstrated definitively only recently (268). Long-term effects of some recent treatments, for example a new chemotherapy regimen for advanced colon cancer that has shown promise in early randomized clinical trials, are not yet known. Individuals in the cancer research community and in government have begun to examine the results of the \"War on Cancer,\" begun officially in 1971, and have noted a lack of significant progress in treating most cancers. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has been criticized for misleading the public about what the results have actually been. One journal article, in particular, became a centerpiece of the debate. \"Progress Against Cancer?\" by John Bailar and Elaine Smith, which appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in May 1986 (65), took a broad view of the emphases in cancer research and the changes in various measures of the disease since 1950, and noted that the age-adjusted mortality rate, (see footnote 3) which was chosen as a measure of overall progress, has risen since 1950. They concluded that treatment for most cancers hasn't gotten much better, and that the greatest promise for cancer control lies in research on prevention. Bailar commented further on his position in a later article (63), in which he stated: \"Modern medicine already has much to offer to virtually every cancer patient, for palliation if not always for cure; the problem is the lack of any substantial recent improvement [emphasis in original] in treating the most common forms of cancer.\" (see footnote 4) The article by Bailar and Smith stirred up interest and controversy, which was furthered by a report by the General Accounting Office (GAO, a congressional agency) that looked at NCI's reporting of cancer survival statistics. GAO examined changes in survival since 1950 for 12 different kinds of cancer and compared its independent findings with those reported by NCI. NCI reported gains for all 12 types. In each case, GAO found a more modest improvement than did NCI, or no gain at all. These results, released in early 1987, again raised controversy about the rate at which progress in treating cancer is being made, and further opened the debate about cancer treatment to public scrutiny. The article by Bailar and Smith and the GAO report have been used by supporters of unconventional treatments to challenge the dominance of the NCI, ACS, and mainstream medicine in general (see, e.g. 189). The widespread use of chemotherapy among classes of patients unlikely to benefit, or for which benefits have not yet been demonstrated, also has drawn criticism from respected researchers (147). The cancer research community itself has been reexamining the value of long-accepted chemotherapy for certain types of cancer. An example is adjuvant treatment of cancers of the colon and rectum, the most common types of cancer in the United States. Debate was focused by a review of all the randomized clinical trials of radiotherapy and standard chemotherapy for these cancers, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1988 (144). The review suggested that these treatments might offer little survival advantage, or at least less than had been assumed, beyond the benefits of surgery, which is the primary treatment. A debate in the medical literature ensued (see, e.g. 108,204) with opinions strongly held for and against the value of adjuvant treatment, based on differing interpretations of the same data. (This debate preceded the dissemination of the results of advanced colon cancer treatment with a new combination of agents, which has shown a survival advantage.) Another debate concerns the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for women who have undergone surgery for early stage breast cancer. Early results from clinical trials prompted the NCI to issue a \"Clinical Alert\" (895), with the strong message that women with early (stage 2) breast cancer without evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. The Clinical Alert elicited strong criticism from prominent members of the medical community, who objected mainly on grounds that the data available from the trials were only preliminary and that they were insufficient to support recommending widespread treatment with toxic chemotherapy (391,572). One result of the debate over progress in cancer was a request by the Senate Appropriations Committee to NCI in 1988 to establish a panel of technical experts and nonexpert public representatives from outside NCI to \"recommend what measures or series of measures are most appropriate to assess progress in cancer\" (874). The panel reviewed measures of progress currently in use and suggested additional approaches (896). Treatments Discussed in This Report The phrase \"unconventional cancer treatments\" encompasses a tremendously heterogeneous group of practices. These treatments vary in content, probably in safety and effectiveness, and in the types of practitioners delivering them. They are defined in this report not by what they are, but by what they are not: they are not part of mainstream, conventional medicine in the United States. Because of this variety, the treatments described do not easily lend themselves to simple, general characterizations. Statements or judgments about one treatment cannot be assumed to apply to others; this applies equally to positive and negative aspects. This report is about the common cancer treatments found by U.S. cancer patients outside of mainstream medicine; in using these treatments, patients may be rejecting conventional medicine, they may be seeking approaches to supplement conventional medicine, or they may believe that conventional medicine has given up on them. Though no census of patients receiving unconventional treatment exists, the literature and expert opinion strongly suggest that Americans are most likely to seek a wide variety of unconventional treatments in the United States, Mexico, or the Caribbean. A few seek particular unconventional treatments in Europe. A large number of unconventional treatments are available in the United States, some practiced in violation of the law and some within the bounds of the law. Some treatments that might be considered unconventional are excluded from discussion in this report. One is the unconventional use of conventional cancer treatment, such as low-dose, high-frequency regimens of chemotherapy, or high- dose pulses of chemotherapy. Although chemotherapeutic regimens are being used in unconventional ways, they are, nevertheless, approved drugs with known efficacy by some route of administration. (see footnote 5) Another type of treatment not included in this discussion is experimental treatment developed within conventional medical research channels, but applied to patients outside of the clinical trial system before they have been approved for use. The most prominent examples of this are the biological response modifiers (such as interleukin-2 and LAK cells) that were (until 1989) offered by Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Franklin, Tennessee) on a commercial basis to patients who were not eligible for or who chose not to participate in clinical trials involving these substances. This report concentrates on unconventional treatments that are well known or that have been used by large numbers of patients. We do not attempt to cover the many individual treatments of various kinds that are offered on a small scale, perhaps to neighbors or friends. It is impossible even to approximate the number of such cases. More often than not, these types of treatment come to public attention only through the legal system, when patients or their survivors bring suit to try to recover money spent on allegedly ineffective treatments or to try to stop the practitioner from continuing to fraudulently treat patients (see, e.g., a recent case in Arizona) (398). The cases that do surface in this way may represent only the worst end of the spectrum, but there is no way to confirm this. This report also does not attempt an account of unconventional treatments that once held the spotlight but have fallen out of favor. A 1949 report of the American Medical Association Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, for instance, lists many unconventional cancer treatments largely unknown today \u2014 \"collodaurum,\" \"Hett Cancer Serum,\" \"AF-2,\" and the \"orgone accumulator\" (39). Some other treatments of the past \u2014the Rife Ray Machine, Krebiozen \u2014still have their supporters, but, by and large, they are no longer in widespread use and are not reviewed in this report. Perhaps the most significant area not included consists of spiritual approaches, among the oldest human responses to illness. How patients express their beliefs and what they do under such circumstances can take many different forms (419,529). Religious figures such as ministers, priests, and rabbis are often called on to counsel patients and their families. Some are also involved in various forms of religious healing, e.g., faith healing, laying on of hands, and prayer. People from all over the world have traveled to the famous religious shrine at Lourdes, France, to pray for miraculous cures. An estimated four million people visit Lourdes each year, 65,000 of whom are ill. The Lourdes medical board has examined thousands of cases claiming cures, and 64 of these have been designated by the Catholic Church as miraculous cures (264). Several of the unconventional treatments discussed in other sections of this report also include a spiritual or religious component. In macrobiotics, for instance, the dietary guidelines are one aspect of a much larger philosophical and spiritual system. Similarly, Anthroposophic medicine, which includes the use of the herbal preparation Iscador for cancer patients, is based on a complex religious philosophy and \"spiritual science\" developed by Rudolph Steiner in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Other unconventional treatments that were designed specifically for cancer patients include a spiritual component. Spiritual aspects of the original Kelley regimen, for example, reflected the developer's strong religious beliefs. A physician who founded the first clinic in Tijuana offering laetrile to cancer patients, Ernesto Contreras, includes a strong spiritual orientation in his regimen and often leads services for patients at a chapel he built at his clinic. Patients may also seek care from traditional healers (outside their own culture), e.g., Native American healers, curanderos, shamans, and others, who use a strong spiritual component in their approach to treatment. Although the extent of use of traditional healing methods by U.S. cancer patients is undocumented, the popular literature suggests that some approaches have become relatively common in recent years. The \"New Age\" movement beginning in the 1960's and 1970's in the United States has popularized a number of mystical practices, such as crystal healing, channeling, and \"neo-shamanism,\" as well as some traditional healing practices involving curanderos, herbalists, and others (421). While most spiritual approaches treat cancer as any other disease or misfortune, some techniques with spiritual or mystical components are often associated specifically with cancer. \"Psychic surgery\" refers to a procedure involving removal of spirits or physical manifestations of spiritual pathology from a patient. Some Americans travel to the Phillipines for \"psychic surgery,\" where it is practiced in its original context of religious and traditional healing (419,530). Psychic surgeons from the Phillipines have also come to the United States, holding treatment sessions as they travel around the country. They have often been pursued by legal authorities and some have been convicted of practicing medicine without a license. Psychic surgery is considered by many in the unconventional community to be a \"fringe\" treatment. Categories of Unconventional Cancer Treatment The treatments described in this report are grouped, for convenience, into four general categories: psychological and behavioral, nutritional, herbal, and pharmacologic and biologic. These categories are not the only ones that could be devised, and the groupings do not connote commonality among their elements beyond the basic nature of the treatment. Since many of the treatments include a variety of components, however, assignment to certain categories was not straightforward and could have been done differently in a number of cases. In general, assignment to the categories was based on the nature of the central or unique element of each approach. Chapter 2 of this report discusses behavioral and psychological approaches to cancer treatment. Many forms of psychological and behavioral intervention are used adjunctively to relieve pain and distress associated with cancer and its treatment, and generally, to improve a patient's psychologic outlook. Some individuals have claimed that psychological approaches can cause tumor regression and prolong survival. The potential contribution of psychosocial interventions to extending life has recently begun to be studied by mainstream researchers, with encouraging results. The efficacy of psychological and behavioral approaches in improving the course of cancer is still uncertain, however. The chapter describes three of the most popular psychological interventions for which claims of tumor regression or life extension have been made: mental imagery, a method involving the creation and interpretation of mental images that was popularized by O. Carl Simonton, M.D., and Stephanie M. Simonton-Atchley; intensive meditation as practiced by the late Australian psychiatrist Ainslie Meares, M.D.; and a unique form of psychotherapy developed by Lawrence LeShan, Ph.D. While these methods are the ones cancer patients are likely to find out about, they have been widely adopted and modified by both mainstream and unconventional practitioners. Applications of psychological and behavioral approaches, particularly when used in addition to mainstream treatment, are considered by some as \"middle ground\" treatments. Chapter 3 discusses treatments whose primary component is dietary. Three widely known regimens are included. Several other treatments described in this report, especially in the pharmacologic category, also include dietary components, but in these cases the dietary element is secondary to other components or is one of several other approaches used. The first discussed in chapter 3 is the Gerson regimen, consisting of a low-salt, high-potassium, vegetarian diet, various pharmacologic agents, and coffee enemas. It was developed in the 1940's and 1950's by the late Max Gerson, M.D., and is now offered at a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico. The second nutritional approach is the Kelley regimen, originally developed by William D. Kelley, D.D.S. The Kelley regimen as currently practiced by Nicholas Gonzalez, M.D., involves a complex nutritional program based on dietary guidelines, vitamin and enzyme supplements, and metabolic typing. Another treatment discussed is the macrobiotic diet, consisting largely of cooked vegetables and whole grains, which proponents recommend as part of an overall macrobiotic philosophy and belief system incorporating many aspects of daily living. The regimens presented here are examples of a wider group of approaches using nutritional components, many of which are poorly documented and are lesser known. A dietary program, which is actually part of a multifaceted approach that includes conventional cancer treatment, stress reduction, exercise, and psychological support, developed by a practicing U.S. physician, Keith Block, M.D., is discussed as an example of a \"middle ground\" approach. In his practice, the dietary needs of cancer patients are assessed using a system that attempts to bring together findings from mainstream nutritional and cancer research with a modified macrobiotic-type diet (without the ideologic underpinnings of macrobiotics). The results of this approach, however, have not yet been assessed in any formal way. Block may be representative of a type of physician who incorporates some dietary advice, often leaning toward a diet with little animal protein, with low fat and high fiber, and who may use psychological and behavior components as well in the treatment of cancer patients, though Block's program is probably more formal than most. There is no documentation of the number of physicians in this category or the content of their nutritional advice, since little has been written about it. However, according to some members of the advisory panel for this study: It is our collective professional judgment that nutritional interventions are going to \"follow\" psychosocial interventions up the ladder into clinical respectability as adjunctive and complementary approaches to the treatment of cancer (8). Chapter 4 discusses five of the best known herbal substances used in unconventional cancer treatments. These include proprietary mixtures of herbal products, such as in the Hoxsey treatment, developed by the late Harry Hoxsey and currently offered in Tijuana; Iscador, made from a species of European mistletoe, used mainly in the context of Anthroposophic medicine in Europe; and Essiac, an herbal tea developed by the late Rene Caisse, R.N., and currently offered in Canada. Also discussed are single-agent treatments, such as chaparral tea, prepared from the leaflets and twigs of the creosote bush, a plant indigenous to the desert areas of the southwestern United States, and Pau d'Arco, a substance derived from the inner bark of trees native to Argentina and Brazil and sold in health food stores in the form of capsules, tea bags, or loose powder. Many other herbal substances are sold in health food stores and are advocated for general health purposes in the unconventional literature, but few others for which information is available appear to be advocated specifically for cancer treatment (exceptions include, e.g., Jason Winters Herbal tea, which is specifically for cancer treatment). Chapter 5 discusses a large and diverse group of unconventional cancer treatments that have as their central component a pharmacologic or biologic substance, such as biochemical agents, vaccines, blood products, and synthetic chemicals. One of the treatments discussed is the regimen developed by the late Virginia Livingston-Wheeler, M.D., and offered at her clinic in San Diego. The main component of the regimen is a vaccine designed to treat and prevent infection with the microbe that Livingston-Wheeler believed to be a cause of cancer. The treatment regimen also includes a variety of components intended to bolster patients' immune responses in general and to counteract effects of microbial infection, including antibiotics, vitamin and mineral supplements, and a special diet. Another treatment described is one offered by Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D., Ph.D., at his clinic in Houston. Burzynski uses what he calls \"Antineoplastons,\" substances described as peptides or amino acid derivatives isolated from urine or synthesized in the laboratory. His current regimen for cancer patients includes oral and intravenous use of approximately 10 types of Antineoplaston, all of which are manufactured at the Burzynski Research Institute in Texas. Another pharmacologic treatment is described by its developer, Emanuel Revici, M.D., as \"biologically guided chemotherapy\" and reported to consist of a variety of minerals, lipids, and lipid-based substances. Revici practices his regimen in New York. \"Eumetabolic\" treatment offered by Hans Nieper, M.D., in Hannover, West Germany, is also described. Nieper prescribes a combination of conventional and unconventional agents (including pharmaceutical drugs, vitamins, minerals, and animal and plant extracts), and recommends that patients follow a special diet and avoid particular agents, foods, and physical locations (\"geopathogenic zones\") that he believes are damaging. Nieper reportedly treats a significant number of U.S. patients. Chapter 5 also describes a number of other pharmacologic and biologic agents that are used as unconventional cancer treatments, some singly and some in combination. Examples include laetrile, a substance widely popular in the 1970's and currently offered in several clinics in Mexico; vitamin C, whose most prominent advocate for use in cancer treatment is the biochemist Linus Pauling, Ph.D.; dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), an industrial solvent often used in combination with laetrile and vitamin C; cellular treatment, processed tissue obtained from animal embryos or fetuses given orally or by injection; and various substances containing oxygen, including hydrogen peroxide and ozone taken orally, rectally, or via blood infusion. Hydrazine sulfate, a substance that, from 1975 to 1982, was on the American Cancer Society's Unproven Methods List, was taken off when clinical trials under an investigational new drug exemption (IND) were started. The trials were controversial, however, and it is still considered in the context of unconventional cancer treatments. Its supporters persisted, however, and recent studies in major research institutions have suggested strongly that this substance may help to improve the nutritional status and prolong the lives of cancer patients by moderating the cachexia (the wasting of the body) that often accompanies late stage cancer. More definitive clinical trials are planned. Supporters of unconventional treatments often point to hydrazine sulfate as a treatment that was unfairly branded by the mainstream but which actually is effective. Some of these pharmacologic and biologic treatments are offered only at single sites under the direction of their developer and chief proponent. Others are more widely available, are not necessarily associated with particular proponents, and may be used in combination with a variety of other unconventional treatments. \"Immuno-augmentative therapy\" (IAT), offered by Lawrence Burton, Ph.D., at his clinics in the Grand Bahamas, West Germany, and Mexico, is the subject of chapter 6. IAT consists of daily injections of dilute serum fractions made from pooled blood samples. As a case study for this assessment, OTA attempted to develop a protocol for studying the efficacy and safety of IAT, in conjunction with Burton, and this attempt is described in the chapter, as is the treatment itself. The protocol attempt ended in a failure to arrive at a plan for study that both Burton and OTA believed would constitute a fair and valid test of IAT. Information Included about Treatments OTA drew from a variety of sources, including peer- reviewed literature, non-peer-reviewed or unpublished literature, patient brochures from individual practices or clinics, and personal communication with practitioners and their associates. The descriptions include, where possible, the approach taken in each treatment, how each is used to treat cancer, the proponents' claims for mode of action and intended outcome, potential adverse effects, and attempts at evaluating each treatment. The uneven coverage of treatments results mainly from the paucity of information about some treatments. In many cases, little or no specific information was available on adverse effects, though the absence of information cannot be taken by itself as an indication that the treatments are safe. According to one observer (218), one reason that little information has been generated about adverse effects of unconventional treatments is the implicit threat of personal legal actions for admitting an adverse effect. While mainstream physicians face little sanctioning for reporting adverse effects of mainstream treatments, an unconventional practitioner might find himself or herself the object of a disciplinary board investigation if he or she were to freely report adverse effects from giving an unconventional treatment. No efforts have been made by licensing boards or other responsible bodies to safeguard against such self-incrimination. For this and other reasons, in the case of each treatment covered in this report, insufficient information exists to support an adequate evaluation of safety and efficacy, though, as mentioned earlier, common sense suggests that some treatments \u2014e.g., psychological, behavioral, and some nutritional approaches \u2014are likely to be inherently safe. \"Adverse effects\" are defined broadly in this report to refer to at least five types of harm that may apply (to both unconventional and conventional treatments). These include hazards posed directly from the treatment itself (intrinsic harm); harm resulting from a patient's improper use of the treatment; harm caused by contaminated or otherwise substandard products resulting from poor manufacturing practices (quality control, design of equipment, etc.); harmful interactions or conflicts with other treatments (conventional or unconventional); and deterioration in a patient's condition caused by forgoing or seriously delaying other treatment that could have been effective. While all these types of adverse effects are possible, it is important to note that on the basis of current information, their significance and magnitude for any given unconventional treatment is unknown. The standards we used for judging the quality of evidence for safety and efficacy are the same standards OTA has developed and applied in a wide range of studies. All past and current OTA studies, except this one, have dealt with mainstream medical practice and research. Many have been critical of the quality of studies and the inadequate basis they form for making health policy decisions. These include studies of well-child care (871), glaucoma screening (873), computed tomography (CT) scanning (865), and alcoholism treatment (868), to name just a few. A number of earlier OTA studies have dealt specifically with the methods of technology assessment, including clinical research. The reader is referred to Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Medical Technologies (863), The Implications of Cost- Effectiveness Analysis of Medical Technology (864), Strategies for Medical Technology Assessment (867), and The Impact of Randomized Clinical Trials on Health Policy and Medical Practice (869). The standards that have developed are based on the experience of clinical trials over the last 30 years or so, largely during which time the methodology has been developed. What has emerged is an understanding of which type of study is likely to produce valid evidence and which is prone to produce answers that are later found, in better designed studies, not to be corroborated. The pros and cons of various study designs are discussed in chapter 12. Practitioners of Unconventional Cancer Treatments Practitioners of unconventional cancer treatments range from charismatic figures with no medical training to highly trained physicians or other health professionals who have departed entirely from mainstream practice. Another important group, though of unknown size and largely undocumented practice, are the \"middle ground\" physicians. Members of the advisory panel for this study offered the following opinion: Most practitioners of unconventional cancer therapies...are interested in and attracted primarily to this \"middle ground.\" They seek to supplement judicious use of conventional therapies with spiritual, psychological, and nutritional approaches that they hope will improve quality of life and possibly contribute to life extension (8). These practitioners do not form a cohesive group and have been relatively silent in the public debate about unconventional cancer treatments. There are also practitioners who are not licensed health professionals who promote specific unconventional cancer treatments, but it is impossible even to estimate the number of such individuals in the United States. Some of these practitioners treat friends and neighbors, while some operate more widely, advertising in alternative publications and promoting themselves nationally. Since these individuals may be in contravention of the law by practicing medicine without a license, some are understandably quiet about their activities. After bad experiences, cancer patients or their families occasionally report these unlicensed practitioners, who then may be subject to civil and criminal charges. A more readily identifiable group of unlicensed practitioners who often give advice about unconventional cancer treatments are some health food store employees. These individuals generally are not formally trained health professionals and are not permitted under law to dispense medical advice or prescribe treatments. A field study carried out for this assessment in three urban areas (420), as well as earlier work (839), suggest that many health food store personnel will, in fact, give medical referrals to unconventional practitioners, will in some cases discourage people from seeking conventional medical care, and will in other cases recommend specific products as treatment. Historically, there have always been a number of well- known practitioners active at a given time. The practices of some, e.g., Max Gerson and Harry Hoxsey, are continued by associates or relatives after the developer dies. Those who become well known have generally been strong personalities, charismatic, who evoke great loyalty on the part of their patients. Physicians in the United States are subject to civil and criminal laws related to the practice of medicine, as well as State licensing requirements and professional standards which, if violated, may lead to sanctions limiting the physicians' ability to practice. Licensed physicians who practice unconventional medicine are subject to the same laws and standards, and have, occasionally, been charged with civil or criminal offenses, had their medical licenses revoked, or been subject to lesser professional sanctions. Some have also had privileges for reimbursement by the Federal Medicare program revoked. The Information Network for Unconventional Cancer Treatments The mainstream medical literature contains very few substantive articles for physicians and patients who want to find out about unconventional cancer treatments. Very few scientific studies of these approaches have been done (529). Most reports that make their way into medical journals concern adverse effects of particular treatments or are generally negative. The unconventional community publishes its own magazines and newsletters (e.g., Health Freedom News, East West: The Journal of Natural Health and Living, Cancer Victors Journal, The Townsend Letter for Doctors), with articles and advertisements for a wide range of unconventional medical treatments, including those for cancer. They commonly include articles critical of mainstream medicine and the government agencies involved in drug policy and health care, in particular the FDA. \"Alternative\" papers and magazines, and sometimes the popular press, often report on unconventional treatments in an uncritical way, relying on individual case histories or the unsupported claims of proponents. Many of these publications also convey a strong anti-mainstream medicine viewpoint. Particular treatments occasionally are publicized through national magazines or television shows. Penthouse, for instance, has run a series of articles on alternative medicine over the past several years, and particular cancer treatments and practitioners have been featured (549,683,684). Some popular television shows, such as 60 Minutes and 20/20 and talk shows such as The Sally Jesse Raphael Show and The Morton Downey, Jr. Show also have featured controversial figures in unconventional medicine, and these appearances have reportedly had enormous impact on the number of patients contacting their clinics (365). Patients may decide to look into unconventional treatments after seeing a television show or reading an article on the subject, but most people are aware, even without a specific reminder, that such treatments exist. According to the few studies that have been done, most patients initially hear about particular treatments by word of mouth, from friends, relatives, or clergy. A large enough number of people have used these treatments that an easily accessible body of descriptive and anecdotal information about them exists. Health food stores are often part of the discovery process, as well. Alternative newspapers and magazines, books and pamphlets, and the health food store personnel themselves are influential sources of information. Written material is available about specific treatments and about organizations that patients can contact for general information on unconventional cancer treatments. From the cancer patient's point of view, the decision to use an unconventional treatment may be based on where treatments are offered and on the claims that are made for them. Most major clinics in the United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean produce brochures for prospective patients, and also give information by telephone. The brochures vary from those using scientific language and claiming various degrees of clinical success to those akin to resort brochures. A patient's decision to take a particular treatment may be influenced by many factors, but in most cases is not made with the help of a physician. Some patients become frustrated when they discover there is so little concrete information about the effectiveness and safety of specific unconventional treatments. Many will have been told, perhaps by a clinic itself, perhaps by other patients or advocates, that the treatment will improve their quality of life and will cause their cancer to regress and possibly disappear. They may have been told by prominent national groups (e.g., ACS, FDA) that, at best, the treatment is untested and therefore unproven, or worse, that it also has dangerous side effects. Based on the work done for this assessment, a common situation is that effectiveness is unknown and relevant information on adverse effects is nonexistent. Patients often decide to go ahead with unconventional treatment because no reliable information confirms that the treatment doesn't work or that it would likely be harmful. They may feel they have nothing to lose by trying it. During the course of this project, OTA was contacted by dozens of patients or their friends or relatives who did want valid information for their decisions about unconventional treatments, and were frustrated to find so little. Patients Who Use Unconventional Cancer Treatments An image persists, and is propagated by at least some mainstream medical literature, that patients taking unconventional treatments are gullible and unsuspecting, or desperate, alienated miracle seekers (see, e.g., (105,223)). Little systematic inquiry has been undertaken on which to base generalizations about these patients, but what has been done suggests that such stereotypes do not apply to many patients who use unconventional cancer treatments. Most of the systematic information that is available has come from patients who have gone to established unconventional treatment clinics, rather than from those treated by independent practitioners. Of the former group, many are highly motivated, college educated, and middle to upper class. Most have had little or no previous contact with unconventional treatments (177). The slim evidence that exists suggests that most patients have had at least some conventional treatment before deciding to try an unconventional course, and many have had full courses of mainstream treatment. In some cases, however, people reject what could be curative conventional treatment in favor of the unconventional, either for themselves or for their children. Some cases have come to light when parents have made that decision for a minor child and legal proceedings against the parents have ensued. A highly publicized case in the late 1970's of this type involved a child with potentially curable leukemia, whose parents decided to forgo chemotherapy for laetrile (see chapter 10 for a discussion of this case). Some unconventional practitioners have been charged criminally with discouraging people, who later died of progressive cancer, from seeking possibly curative treatment, or for failing to encourage them to seek such treatment (see ch. 11). Once begun on an unconventional course, many patients also continue to see mainstream medical practitioners, but many do not; one reason for this is that many mainstream physicians generally disapprove of unconventional treatments. In addition, some prominent unconventional practitioners discourage patients from returning to their doctors at home, and some insist that they not take any other treatment. In some cases, patients hide their unconventional treatment from mainstream physicians, and hide mainstream treatment from unconventional practitioners. Followup on patients and, therefore, documentation of the course of their treatment and disease, are generally unreliable. In one of the few direct studies of patients who were using unconventional treatments, Cassileth and colleagues found that most, about 85 percent, had used both conventional and unconventional treatments during their illness. Fifteen percent had sought only unconventional treatment after diagnosis (177). Whenever the characteristics of patients using unconventional treatments are discussed, the same few studies and surveys are mentioned: These usually include the study by Barrie Cassileth and colleagues (referred to above) of about 600 patients, half of whom were in treatment at a University-based cancer center and half of whom were patients at an established alternative clinic (177); and a 1986 Lou Harris survey for the FDA of a general population sample concerning their use of unconventional medical care of all kinds (566). Overall, too little information exists to characterize reliably the circumstances under which patients use unconventional cancer treatments. This is an area in which it is possible to gather information, however, and there are researchers interested in doing so. But according to some interested researchers, little money is available for this type of social science research (175). Costs and Insurance Coverage of Unconventional Cancer Treatments Since most health insurance policies \u2014public and private \u2014do not cover charges for unconventional cancer treatments, patients generally pay for them directly. OTA gathered information on costs of unconventional cancer treatment at 44 clinics or other sites in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Bahamas, and on the practices of several major third-party payers regarding such treatments. It was found that the costs of treatment vary widely, from a few hundred to several hundred thousand dollars per patient; however, most major clinics currently charge between $5,000 and $40,000 for an \"average\" course of treatment. Some clinics charge a set fee for an entire course of treatment, while others charge by individual components, making it difficult or impossible for patients to estimate in advance what treatment will cost. Insurance coverage under the Federal Medicare program (for people 65 and over) is limited to care that is \"reasonable and necessary,\" which for drugs generally refers to those that are FDA approved, and in some cases to drugs designated by NCI as \"Group C\" (Group C drugs have been found to have some therapeutic value in clinical trials, but have not yet been approved by FDA). Most Blue Cross/Blue Shield and private insurance plans have similar restrictions. Most health insurance contracts contain general language that excludes coverage of unconventional treatments, and some specify particular treatments by name. Examples in some plans are exclusions of coverage for laetrile, IAT, and cell therapy. Nevertheless, a number of clinics offering unconventional cancer treatments state or imply in their brochures that the treatments costs are covered under various insurance plans, perhaps creating an expectation that patients may be reimbursed. The IAT brochure, for example, states, \"More and more insurance companies are readily accepting IAT claims for full or partial reimbursement\" (429). Clinics may also advise or assist patients in filling out insurance claim forms; other clinics may be affiliated with a contractor who will submit reimbursement forms to insurers on a patient's behalf. In some cases, the claims are paid, but rarely if the claim explicitly states that it is for an unconventional treatment. A number of insurance fraud cases have involved unconventional cancer treatments. Advocates of unconventional cancer treatments consider the lack of insurance coverage a major problem. In a joint letter to OTA, some members of the advisory panel for this study expressed their opinion on the need for a critical review of whether the U.S. health insurance system \"is in fact acting in the public interest in seeking categorically to deny reimbursement for all forms of unconventional cancer therapies\" (8). Refusal of reimbursement, they assert, extends to \"psychosocial interventions for control of pain, nausea, and enhanced quality of life at leading teaching institutions.\" They also commented that \"'Fraudulent' claims are the social consequence of a reimbursement system that restricts itself to the narrowly construed cytotoxic and biomedical treatment of cancer.\" Evaluating Unconventional Cancer Treatments In chapters 2 through 6 of this report, information is provided about a variety of unconventional cancer treatments. As mentioned above, and to the extent possible, the composition of treatments and the ways in which they are used are described, the rationales and theories provided by their supporters discussed, and the available evidence concerning their effects on cancer patients presented and critiqued. In these treatment \"portraits,\" there are pieces of information, ideas, various fragments that some might find provocative, or suggestive of a worthwhile approach, and other pieces suggesting that a treatment is groundless. No doubt this report will be used selectively by individuals wishing to portray various points of view, in support of or in opposition to particular treatments. The reason this is possible is that, almost uniformly, the treatments have not been evaluated using methods appropriate for actually determining whether they are effective. Regrettably, there is no guidance for new patients wanting to know whether these treatments are likely to help them. Digging through descriptive information, theoretical discussions, laboratory tests, or individual case histories of exceptional patients does not adequately answer the question of whether the treatment works \u2014whether it prolongs or otherwise improves life, or effects a cure. The background information is useful, vital in some cases, to get to the point of evaluation. Regardless of the nature of the treatment, however, or of its intended effects, it is as true for unconventional as it is for mainstream treatments that in the final analysis, except for those extraordinarily rare treatments whose effects are dramatic, gathering empirical data from clinical trials in cancer patients using valid, rigorous methods is the only means currently available for determining whether a treatment is likely to be of value to cancer patients in general or to a class of patients. For none of the treatments reviewed in this report did the evidence support a finding of obvious, dramatic benefit that would obviate the need for formal evaluation to determine effectiveness, despite claims to that effect for a number of treatments. Pursuit of evaluation by practitioners and supporters varies considerably among the wide range of treatments covered in this report. As portrayed by members of the project Advisory Panel, proponents of the \"middle ground\" (mainly psychological, behavioral, and dietary approaches used along with mainstream treatment) may be most interested in testing and refining their treatments, but they apparently find the current system for doing so unsupportive (8). An additional hurdle is posed by the different orientations toward evaluation in the social sciences, from which a number of psychological and behavioral approaches have come, as opposed to that in medicine. The former rely more heavily on inferences from uncontrolled, nonexperimental observation, whereas the evaluation of medical technologies relies heavily on experimental designs, particularly randomized clinical trials. At least some psychological practitioners and researchers(7) have expressed an explicit belief that such experimental methods are not necessary or appropriate to determine the effects of psychological and behavioral approaches. From a methodological point of view, for treatments consisting of pharmacologic or biologic agents that are intended to extend survival time, with or without affecting the tumor directly, appropriate evaluation methods would be the same as those that have been developed and validated for mainstream pharmacologic and biologic treatments. Should new, validated methods become available \u2014 e.g., approaches currently being investigated under the rubric of \"outcomes research\" or \"medical treatment effectiveness research\"(880) \u2014 these, naturally, could apply to unconventional as well as conventional treatments. In the case of outcomes or effectiveness research, however, it will probably be some years before enough is learned about these techniques to gauge their long-term usefulness. For many-faceted approaches \u2014e.g., combinations of dietary, psychological, and behavioral aspects \u2014which have as major goals improved quality of life, some adaptation of methods may be necessary, perhaps borrowing from social science research, where appropriate. But in the final analysis, the concepts basic to the unbiased evaluation of medical interventions and the reliance on randomized clinical trials will still apply. Practical problems, not methodologic ones, however, are likely to be the most significant obstacles to evaluating unconventional cancer treatments. Chapter 12 of this report discusses past approaches to evaluating unconventional treatments, along with some ideas that might be adopted to further evaluation efforts. The term \"evaluation\" is used broadly here to describe the systematic gathering of evidence related to the effectiveness and safety of treatments, including information provided by supporters of unconventional treatments and individuals unaffiliated with specific treatments. Review of Evidence for an Unconventional Treatment: An Example For the most part, evidence put forward by individuals identified strongly with particular treatments has been of a type not acceptable to the mainstream medical community, usually because the evidence cannot support the conclusions drawn. A common format is a series of individual case histories, described in narrative. The endpoints are more often than not \"longer than expected\" survival times, sometimes with claims of tumor regression. In mainstream research, case reports of unexpected outcomes have been useful and do have a place, but they almost never can provide definite evidence of a treatment's effectiveness. An example, well known among supporters of unconventional treatments, of evidence put forth systematically by a proponent is a series of case reports of 50 patients treated by Kelley with his nutritional program, and described by Gonzalez, a physician, in his unpublished book about Kelley, One Man Alone: An Investigation of Nutrition, Cancer, and William Donald Kelley (353). (Gonzalez himself practices a variation of the Kelley program.) This series has been singled out by unconventional treatment proponents as one of the best of its kind, which has been ignored by mainstream medicine (529,596). OTA carried out a review of Gonzalez' material by six members of the advisory panel for this project, three physicians generally supportive of unconventional treatments (though none associated directly with the Kelley program) and three mainstream oncologists. Each case was assigned randomly to one unconventional and one mainstream physician. Fifteen cases were judged by the unconventional reviewer as definitely showing a positive effect of the Kelley program; the mainstream reviewer of each case found 13 of these unconvincing and 2 unusual. Nine cases were judged unusual or suggestive by the unconventional reviewer; the mainstream reviewer found these cases unconvincing. Fourteen cases were judged by the unconventional reviewer to have been helped by a combination of mainstream plus Kelley treatment; the mainstream reviewer found 12 of these cases unconvincing and 2 unusual. Twelve cases were considered unconvincing to both the unconventional and mainstream reviewers. (see footnote 6) The mainstream reviewers had similar general comments about the cases. A general theme was that, based on the material presented, it was not possible to relate results to particular treatments. Nearly all patients had mainstream treatment, which, along with the natural variability of the disease, might have been sufficient to account for the observed outcome. One reviewer commented: Those of us who have worked over the years with cancer patients have come to respect the vagaries of human biology wherein there are cancer patients who for unclear reasons fare better than we would have expected (544). Another common criticism was that comparing an individual patient's survival with average group statistics is misleading and an invalid use of data. General comments of the unconventional reviewers were significantly different and, in general, positive about the Kelley treatment. One reviewer wrote: I would judge that the patients under my review appear probably, but not certainly, to have presented for the most part an unusual course, that the outcome exceeded normal management and that the effect of the Kelley treatment contributed significantly, although not necessarily exclusively, to the outcome (218). What this review demonstrates most clearly is that some of Gonzalez' cases may be convincing to physicians already supportive of unconventional treatment but that they were not convincing to the mainstream physicians who participated in the OTA review, and, because of the reasons given, probably would not be to most other mainstream physicians. Key issues appear to be lack of adequate documentation of the course of disease and reliance on unusually long survival rather than documented tumor regression in most cases. Clinical Trials of Unconventional Cancer Treatments Relatively recently, studies by independent researchers have contributed to the evaluation of unconventional treatments. Studies of particular note include two randomized trials, one of hydrazine sulfate by researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles (186), and the other of a psychological intervention, carried out by a psychiatrist-researcher at Stanford University (824). Both studies were methodologically sound, published in peer- reviewed journals, and, in both, the interventions were associated with increased longevity and with improvements in some more subjective measures. Further studies of these interventions have been planned as a result of these initial studies. Formal attempts at evaluating unconventional cancer treatments have been made by the Federal Government in various ways. The best known are clinical trials of laetrile and vitamin C that were carried out by researchers at the Mayo Clinic under contract to NCI. In both instances, the Government was responding to the expanding popularity of these compounds with the public. In the case of laetrile, although it was not approved by FDA, by 1982 its use had been legalized by more than half the States and it could be used legally in the rest of the country as a result of a court order. The published laboratory studies of laetrile's activity did not suggest that it would be active against cancer, however, and no adequate study of cancer patients had been done. Interest in the use of vitamin C, a widely available product, grew as a result of studies of cancer patients reported by Ewan Cameron in the early 1970s, later in collaboration with Linus Pauling, and because of evidence from in vitro and animal studies suggesting beneficial effects of vitamin C. The laetrile experience is discussed here. During its period of greatest popularity, laetrile was promoted mainly as an agent that acts directly against tumor cells, and it was treated as such when the Government decided to evaluate it. The first step taken was to look for evidence that laetrile caused tumors to regress. To do this, about 450,000 physicians and other health professionals were solicited for reports of patients with documented antitumor responses to laetrile. In the end, 67 cases had sufficient information to be evaluated independently. Out of these \"best cases,\" a blinded review resulted in establishing two complete and four partial remissions (274). NCI decided to proceed with a prospective study of laetrile, carried out by researchers at the Mayo Clinic. They began with a typical \"phase I\" study to determine toxicity and dose (620). Those results were used in designing the phase II study of antitumor activity in 178 patients with a variety of cancer types (623). Among the 175 patients evaluable at the end of the study, one had a partial remission. No further clinical trials were deemed necessary, as the drug was considered ineffective. A host of criticisms was heard from laetrile proponents. In the confrontational atmosphere that exists around unconventional cancer treatments, it appears impossible to resolve these questions conclusively, but this study appears to have been a fair test of the main claim for laetrile, that it was an antitumor agent. Possibilities for Improved Evaluation of Unconventional Treatments The basic principles of scientific evaluation are firm, but the process of reaching the point of formal evaluation and the practical problems of acquiring useful evidence about the efficacy and safety of unconventional treatments may be different in some ways from those encountered in mainstream treatments. Multifaceted treatments, such as the Gerson treatment and macrobiotics, which would be difficult if not impossible to reproduce in a medical center for the purpose of evaluation, pose additional practical problems, and suggest the need for studies to occur in their own settings. It has been suggested that this might be possible with the participation of \"dispassionate researchers, on site\" (88), who would evaluate patients for objective evidence of effectiveness before and after treatment. It would not be possible to measure improved survival in this way (without an appropriate comparison group), but it might be possible to determine whether the treatment had anti-tumor effects. Descriptive information about quality of life could be gathered, but again, without an appropriate comparison, it would be difficult if not impossible to attribute benefits to the treatment. Such studies would represent a new direction; OTA could identify no examples of methodologically sound clinical trials, assisted by dispassionate observers, of unconventional treatments carried out in their unconventional settings. In principle, clinical trials are simple, but they can be extremely difficult to organize, even working entirely within the system. The added complications of working with an unconventional treatment render such trials a true challenge. OTA's experience during this assessment in developing a clinical trial protocol for IAT illuminated some key points. One of the most significant is that, except in rare cases, evaluation should be initiated by and the responsibility of the practitioners using or otherwise positively interested in the treatment, though they need not be (and preferably are not) associated exclusively with the treatment. (The Federal Government has initiated evaluations only when treatments [laetrile and vitamin C] have become very popular and potentially affected large numbers of patients.) Whoever undertakes these studies, it is important to involve developers or other key practitioners of the treatment in developing a plan for the study, and in reporting and publishing its results. To ensure credibility and the availability of technical expertise, the trial should, if possible, be carried out in an accredited medical institution in the United States, with the consent of the appropriate Institutional Review Boards. Finally, it is of the greatest importance that in any study the safety of patients is ensured. This may be best accomplished by carrying out studies in accordance with FDA regulations governing new and unapproved drugs and devices (when applicable). A \"Best Case Series\" Approach New treatments for cancer coming from mainstream research typically progress through a sequence of preclinical and clinical studies before they are offered to cancer patients outside an experimental setting. Clinical trials generally continue even after anti-cancer agents are approved, building on the pre-approval research. Unconventional treatments currently in use have bypassed this system before being used to treat cancer patients. While OTA has not taken a position condoning or condemning the use of treatments unproven through generally accepted means, the fact that this is the case with unconventional treatments cannot be ignored. In the course of this study, OTA explored the potential for using the experience of the self-selected patients who have undergone unconventional treatments to inform the evaluation process. It is possible that this experience, presented systematically, might be useful in generating interest in a treatment, and possibly in designing a clinical trial. However, no valid mechanism exists to use this retrospective patient experience to actually determine the efficacy and safety of these treatments. Except in rare circumstances, because of the heterogeneity of cancer patients' clinical courses, it is virtually impossible to predict what would have happened to a particular patient if he or she had had no treatment or a different treatment. Groups of patients who have chosen to take a particular treatment cannot be compared retrospectively with other groups of patients, even those with similar disease, to determine the effects of the treatment. The factors that set apart patients who take unconventional treatments from other cancer patients may be related to prognosis (these may be both physical and psychological factors), and the means do not exist currently to confidently \"adjust\" for these factors in analyses. Examples of retrospective evaluations that have turned out to be wrong are well documented (see, e.g., (146)) as are problems with attempting to evaluate the efficacy of treatment from registries of cancer patients (145), though the problems are not necessarily widely appreciated. Nonetheless, the clinical experience of practitioners with unconventional cancer treatments may be useful for 1) providing preliminary evidence that can be used to support undertaking formal evaluation; and 2) helping design a formal evaluation, by identifying tumor types that might be responsive, by specifying dosages, and by suggesting potential adverse effects for which monitoring might be necessary. One way to summarize and communicate the clinical experience for these purposes is to conduct a formal retrospective review of \"best cases,\" which would include full diagnostic, treatment, and outcome information for a group of patients treated previously and followed up. This is particularly well suited to treatments intended to cause tumor regression. The objective would be to provide clear evidence of tumor regression after the unconventional treatment which could not logically be ascribed to either other treatment or the natural history of the disease itself. The responsibility for best case reviews would rest with the practitioners offering unconventional treatments, ideally with technical advice from appropriate experts. This approach, still untested, would place the burden of initiating the evaluation process on the practitioner. No matter how well done, however, a best case review cannot take the place of prospective clinical trials, and no firm statements about effectiveness could be made on the basis of a best case review. It is possible that, like the review of laetrile cases, (see footnote 7) relatively little will be learned from best case reviews, despite significant effort. This will depend, to some extent, on the availability of sufficiently detailed medical records, from both unconventional and mainstream treatment. The latter, particularly, may not be accessible to unconventional practitioners. What might happen after a successful best case review is still an open question. In general, the aim would be to apply widely accepted research methods \u2014preclinical, clinical, or both, depending on the intervention \u2014 to begin formal evaluation. Improvements in survival, \"disease-free survival\" (surviving without signs of cancer), and quality of life are the desired outcomes of cancer treatment. As it turns out, treatments that thus far are known to improve survival have a direct effect on tumor cells, causing regression of tumor masses, so tumor size is also of interest as an indicator of anti-tumor activity. In some cases, tumor shrinkage, even if not complete, can relieve physical problems caused by the position and size of a tumor, increasing survival time and improving quality of life. However, because many chemotherapy regimens also have significant toxicity, the ability to shrink tumors does not necessarily correlate with improved survival (see, e.g., (91)). Getting reliable evidence about anti-tumor effects, improvements in survival and disease-free survival, and quality of life requires formal clinical trials in almost all cases. Exceptions would be treatments that are dramatically effective, that produce long-term remissions in a sizable percentage of patients with advanced cancer. Unfortunately, such treatments are rare. The challenge is to find ways in which unconventional cancer treatments can be evaluated adequately, and in which less dramatic but still worthwhile benefits could be detected. If an unconventional treatment appears \"promising\" (e.g., on the basis of a best case review), there might be sufficient impetus for pursuing formal evaluation. There may, in addition, be other reasons for conducting an evaluation of an unconventional treatment. Such studies could be very important in terms of public health, though they might well not lead to advances in cancer treatment. A treatment's popularity might influence the decision. It might be considered important, for public health reasons, to evaluate treatments used by large numbers of people, e.g., treatments offered by the long-established clinics or particular treatments that gain widespread acceptance without proper clinical trials (e.g., laetrile). This is not to suggest that negative evidence will always dissuade cancer patients or that mere popularity should be taken as a sign of effectiveness. Indeed, it is clear from past experience in both conventional and unconventional medicine that the two are not necessarily synonymous. Another factor that, in the real world, might stimulate consideration of an evaluation is political interest. This was the case in OTA's undertaking protocol development for a clinical trial of IAT. Technical and Financial Support for Evaluations The Federal Government, through the NCI, is the country's largest sponsor of cancer clinical trials. Others sources of funding do exist. The most obvious case is funding of research by pharmaceutical companies. Another recent model is the funding and running of clinical trials by AIDS activists. Their first, successful venture was a clinical trial of aerosolized pentamidine, a drug that inhibits the development of pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV- positive individuals. While this model is new, it is available to supporters of unconventional cancer treatments, and it bypasses the NCI peer review process. But funding by the Federal Government should be a real possibility, particularly for treatments that could, if they should prove effective, be made widely available to cancer patients. While no formal barriers block requests from practitioners of unconventional cancer treatments for Government support of research, these practitioners, in general, will be unsuccessful in competing for research dollars without technical assistance. The informal barriers are formidable. The most serious problem in attempting to assure that evaluations of unconventional treatments are scientifically credible is that many or most practitioners of unconventional cancer treatments are not familiar with mainstream clinical research methods, nor do they have easy access to experts who are. What is needed, and would be particularly helpful at the stage of preparing best case series or conducting small studies within unconventional settings, is technical assistance to make sure that the standards of evidence are understood, and for helping the practitioner prepare a work plan for the project. It is in the public interest for the Federal Government, NCI in this case, to be involved in providing some technical assistance, and easing access to NCI review of formal best case series. NCI can help assure the quality of any such best case reviews that are submitted, and, if the results are promising, assist in developing a plan for further evaluation. Funding by the Federal Government carries with it conditions on research that some parts of the unconventional community may find problematic. These include a general prohibition against funding clinical trials outside the United States, the requirement that clinical trials be carried out in compliance with FDA regulations, the particular requirements for informed consent of patients participating in clinical trials, and the general concerns for complete disclosure and reporting. Options - Options To Broaden the Base of Information on the Use of - Unconventional Cancer Treatments in the United States 1a. Studies on the Characteristics and Motivations of Cancer Patients Who Use Unconventional Treatments \u2014Relatively little is known about the types of patients who use unconventional treatments, and their motivations for doing so. The few studies that have been done do not support the stereotype of the desperate, ignorant miracle seeker. Research could be carried out to gather this information through broadly based surveys of patients in the United States. As with all research of this type, the anonymity of the patients surveyed should be guaranteed. It might be useful to consider studies specifically in \"SEER\" (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) areas, in which incidence data are routinely collected. Such information would be useful for determining the types of information the public desires and developing the best means of targeting that information. 1b. Utilization Studies \u2014Studies could be done to determine the types of unconventional cancer treatment used in the United States and the extent of use. This information, together with the information from studies of patients (option 1), could be used to determine the appropriate priority to be given evaluations of unconventional cancer treatments. Gathering and Making Available Information on Unconventional Cancer Treatments and Practitioners 2. Studies on Information Dissemination by Federal Agencies \u2014The National Cancer Institute could have its Cancer Information Service (and Cancer Communications Office) evaluated for the adequacy and quality of information it supplies about widely used unconventional cancer treatments in relation to the information requirements of its users. Improving Information on the Efficacy and Safety of Treatments Used by U.S. Citizens 3. Mandated Responsibility of NCI To Pursue Information About and Facilitate Examination of Widely Used Unconventional Cancer Treatments for Therapeutic Potential \u2014NCI does not now formally seek out information on a wide range of unconventional treatments. Most of their activities in the past have been in reaction to reported problems or as a result of congressional pressure. Activities might take place in various sections of NCI (e.g., the Natural Products Branch would be the logical place for herbal treatments to be examined). Particularly with a new set of in vitro screening tests coming into use by NCI, consideration could be given to screening appropriate components of unconventional treatments. (Many herbal compounds have been screened in the past, with a mixture of positive and negative test results.) 4. Facilitating \"Best Case Series\" of Unconventionally Treated Patients 4a. NCI could develop and circulate widely specifications for a simple process for assembling \"best case\" series in a form that might be acceptable for publication in the peer-reviewed literature. NCI might consider providing for a meeting with the preparer after the review has been completed, to discuss the review, for the purpose of minimizing avoidable ambiguities or misunderstandings. 4b. NCI could provide funding to recruit and support a small group of consultant experts in evaluation methodology to advise unconventional practitioners or their advocates who wish to plan and carry out evaluations. These could range from advising on plans for \"best case\" series to planning randomized trials, when appropriate. These consultants could also assist with filing IND applications, should evaluation reach that stage. One possible mechanism for carrying out this option would be to contract, on a competitive basis, with a university or other appropriate organization to assemble and direct the consultant group. Consultants would most likely be academics or researchers who would devote a limited amount of time per year to this activity, but to whom unconventional practitioners could have easy access. Initially, this group could be given the task of drawing up specifications for best case reviews. 5. Providing Funds for Meritorious Evaluations of Unconventional Cancer Treatments \u2014In a time-limited demonstration project, the Federal Government, either through NCI or through another office, could provide funds for evaluating unconventional cancer treatments. A review committee could be established to review proposals for evaluations, which would have to meet appropriate methodologic standards. The committee should include both mainstream scientists/physicians and scientists/physicians identified with unconventional treatments. Four years might be an appropriate time period for the demonstration, divided into the two phases described below. If implemented, the program should be evaluated after three or four years to determine whether the mechanism has stimulated worthwhile evaluative efforts, and whether it should be continued. The amount of funds that would be used for such a demonstration depends on balancing two conflicting factors: funds would need to be large enough to provide for a fair test of the program, but the Government needs to limit the amount to reasonable levels until the value of such an effort is demonstrated. During the first phase, research proposals would be solicited and reviewed. The review committee would be funded in this phase, but no actual research funds would be allocated. Estimates of annual funding requirements for phase two would be based on the quantity and quality of proposals received during the first phase. 6. Reporting System for Remissions With Unconventional Treatments or Without Treatment \u2014The Federal Government could maintain a registry for reports of documented tumor regressions that follow unconventional treatment in circumstances where the regression cannot plausibly be ascribed to the effects of previous or concurrent conventional treatments, and for regressions occurring in the absence of any treatment. Criteria for documentation of cases would be specified. This would be of value not only to gather information about potentially useful unconventional treatments, but also to further knowledge about spontaneous remissions. 7. Reporting System for Adverse Effects of Unconventional Treatments \u2014 The Federal Government could maintain a registry for reports of documented adverse effects of unconventional cancer treatments (and of unconventional treatments in other major disease). Currently, physicians are required to report adverse reactions to prescription drugs, but no such requirement exists for unapproved substances. Criteria for acceptable cases would be specified. - Making Available Information on Legal Sanctions Against Practitioners - and Health Fraud Related to Unconventional Cancer Treatments 8. Information About Prosecutions for Practicing Medicine Without a License \u2014 Little information is currently available to the public on practitioners of unconventional cancer treatments who have been convicted for practicing medicine without a license. This information might be useful to patients seeking background information on available treatments and on the practitioners. States' Attorneys General offices might assemble this information and make it more readily accessible to the public. A Federal effort could link information from the States. Footnotes 1. The 1978 OTA report Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Medical Technologies (863) cites Kerr White's estimate that only 10 to 20 percent of all procedures used in mainstream medical practice have been been shown to be efficacious by controlled trial. 2. Technically, FDA approval must be obtained before drugs and biologics may be marketed in interstate commerce. This criterion excludes only an exceedingly small proportion of medicines. 3. A mortality rate measures the proportion of the population dying during a given time period. An age- adjusted rate removes the effect of changes in population size and age distribution within the population, allowing direct comparison of the rate over time. In the United States, this allows for population growth, as well as growth in the percentage of people in older age groups. 4. Bailar went on in that article to say: \"There is no comfort here for the 'medical counterculture'; nonstandard (or 'unorthodox') treatments are likely to be dangerous as well as utterly ineffective.\" 5. This is distinguished from the use of a substance for cancer treatment that is approved only for indications not related to cancer, such as the use in unconventional cancer treatment of dimethyl sulfoxide, a drug currently approved only for the treatment of interstitial cystitis. Uses such as these are within the scope of this report. 6. Termed \"unconventional reviewers\" and \"mainstream reviewers\" for purposes of this discussion. 7. The laetrile review, however, was different from what is proposed here in that the Government conducted it.

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-four-hundred-thirty-four) [OTA Report: Behavioral and Psychological Approaches](https://quackwatch.org/related/ota/ota02/) Over the past two decades, the role that personal characteristics and behaviors might play in recovery from serious illness has become a widely discussed topic, both in the scientific and popular literature. In self-help books geared toward cancer patients, for example, certain attitudes and characteristics, such as having a \"cancer- prone personality,\" are commonly linked with hastening the course of illness or allowing it to develop in the first place. Other characteristics, such as a strong \"will to live\" and a good \"coping style,\" are often credited with preventing illness, reversing the course of existing disease, or prolonging life. Newspaper and magazine accounts of spontaneous remissions and of individuals who outlived their physicians' predictions lend widespread support to these ideas.

Over the past two decades, the role that personal characteristics and behaviors might play in recovery from serious illness has become a widely discussed topic, both in the scientific and popular literature. In self-help books geared toward cancer patients, for example, certain attitudes and characteristics, such as having a \"cancer- prone personality,\" are commonly linked with hastening the course of illness or allowing it to develop in the first place. Other characteristics, such as a strong \"will to live\" and a good \"coping style,\" are often credited with preventing illness, reversing the course of existing disease, or prolonging life. Newspaper and magazine accounts of spontaneous remissions and of individuals who outlived their physicians' predictions lend widespread support to these ideas. Recently, reports of spontaneous remissions from cancer have begun to be collected in an annotated bibliography intended for researchers studying psychosocial factors and interventions in cancer treatment (688). Several popular books on the role of emotions and behavior in recovery from serious illness have helped bring this subject into the foreground of cancer treatment. Some of the best known examples include Norman Cousins' Anatomy of an Illness and Head First, Bernie Siegel's Love, Medicine and Miracles and Peace, Love and Healing, and the Simontons' Getting Well Again. From various points of view, these books encourage patients to combat feelings of hopelessness, passivity, and depression that may accompany life-threatening illness and to develop positive outlooks and effective coping strategies. Along with a number of other available books on the subject, these books support the view that patients' efforts to promote physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual well-being, or \"healing,\" can enhance the environment for medical care, improve psychological and physical adjustment to the disease, and in some cases tip the balance toward recovery. Guided imagery, meditation, psychological counseling, support groups, and other approaches are often used to help patients achieve these goals. Increasingly, psychological and behavioral methods are becoming a regular part of cancer treatment, whether included explicitly as part of conventional regimens or sought out independently. For the most part, the aim of these methods is to enhance quality of life. In some cases, however, claims of tumor regression or prolonged survival are made, based largely on case reports and uncontrolled studies. Although initial attempts at controlled studies evaluating psychosocial interventions have recently been made, the efficacy of psychological and behavioral approaches in improving the course of cancer is still uncertain. This chapter focuses on the use of psychological and behavioral methods for modifying the disease process itself \u2014in other words, as unconventional cancer treatment. Conventional uses of psychological interventions in enhancing quality of life are summarized first, followed by a brief discussion of current research on relationships among emotions, immunity, and cancer. The next section of this chapter describes three of the most popular psychological interventions for which claims of tumor regression or life extension have been made. The final section summarizes the available information from studies attempting to evaluate the efficacy of various psychological and behavioral interventions in altering the course of cancer. Psychosocial Support for Cancer Patients In the past decade, demand by cancer patients and survivors for psychosocial support services has grown. Community organizations, patients, treatment centers, and professional societies have worked together to develop support services for an estimated 5 million U.S. cancer patients and survivors (406). A variety of psychological and behavioral interventions are being used to address physical and psychosocial needs of cancer patients and long-term survivors. Some of these interventions are incorporated into conventional treatment programs, while others are offered outside of medical settings, e.g., as part of cancer support group activities. For the most part, these interventions are designed to help patients reduce pain, control nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, and cope with other physical or mental disorders that the disease and its treatment may bring about (523,742). Examples of interventions used to reduce distress associated with cancer and chemotherapy include hypnosis, progressive muscle relaxation training with guided imagery, and systematic desensitization (102,169,823,844). Increasingly, psychological approaches are also being used to address broader emotional and social issues among cancer patients and their families. Patients may seek help in changing their lifestyles, in reducing stress, in reexamining their relationships with others, or in planning for the future (807). There is a wide variety of hospital-based and independent support groups and peer support programs for patients and their families. Examples include Cancer Care, Cancer Guidance Institute, Cancer Lifeline, Center for Attitudinal Healing Phone Pal/Pen Pal Program, Cancer Hopefuls United for Mutual Support, the International Association of Laryngectomies, Make Today Count, Ronald McDonald House, and the United Ostomy Association. These groups differ in scope, components, and approach. Some are sponsored by the American Cancer Society (ACS), including CanSurmount, Reach for Recovery, and Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation. Patients calling ACS's Cancer Response System telephone number can be referred to local ACS support groups, hospital-based groups, or affiliated groups. A number of others are associated with the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, an Albuquerque-based organization that encourages the development of local support groups, provides information for patients and researchers, and assists patients with problems in job discrimination, insurance coverage, and doctor- patient communication (825). The psychosocial support offered by the groups described below is based on the idea that cancer patients can improve the quality of their lives and perhaps contribute to their treatment and recovery by becoming actively involved in the fight against their cancer. Unlike self-help groups that also act as advocates of either mainstream or unconventional cancer treatments, these groups are relatively autonomous (528). They are not affiliated with facilities or organizations that provide medical care or advocate particular types of cancer treatment. They all, however, see their programs as complementary to ongoing medical care. While there is a growing population of cancer patients who wish to become actively involved in the fight against their illness through these sorts of programs, it is estimated that only about one in ten patients follow this route (528). It is possible that more cancer patients will choose to pursue these approaches if they become more widely known and readily accessible (e.g., through oncologists or hospitals) (528). One of the best known programs offering psychosocial support is the Wellness Community, which was founded by Harold Benjamin in 1982 in Santa Monica, California and is expanding, through patient demand, to other parts of the country. As of early 1990, programs were in operation in Redondo Beach, CA, San Diego, CA, and Knoxville, TN. Several other centers were planned or were in various stages of development at that time (74). The Wellness Community's program, which is free to participants, is intended to encourage cancer patients and their families to participate actively in the fight for recovery, thereby improving the quality of their lives and possibly enhancing their chances of long-term survival (612). Since its beginning, it has attracted more than 8,000 cancer patients and family members (954). The Wellness Community explicitly states that its approach to patient care is in support of, not a substitute for, mainstream medical care. Many cancer patients are reportedly referred to the program by their oncologists. Oncologists also serve on the centers' Professional Advisory Boards, which have direct input to the staff of State- licensed psychotherapists at each center. The size of the staff at each facility varies according to the community; as of 1987, the program in Santa Monica was staffed by seven psychotherapists and seven psychotherapy interns (612). The central elements of the Wellness Community are the mutual aid groups that focus on cancer patients' feelings and that teach self-help techniques with the idea that \"positive emotions and positive mental activities may improve the possibility of recovery from cancer\" (954). Other group activities include lectures for patients (on topics ranging from self-esteem to nutrition), potluck dinners, charade nights, joke festivals, picnics, and other group activities designed \"to bring smiles and laughter into the lives of cancer patients\" (612). In addition, members may also have one-on-one sessions with the staff psychotherapists. Another widely known support group is the Exceptional Cancer Patients (ECaP) program founded in 1978 by Bernie Siegel, M.D. in New Haven, Connecticut. The program is said to be based on \"carefrontation,\" described as \"a loving, safe, therapeutic confrontation, which facilitates personal change and healing\" (804). Siegel's program includes individual and group support that makes use of patients' dreams, drawings, and images in an effort to \"make everyone aware of his or her own healing potential\" (804) and to become an \"exceptional cancer patient,\" which Siegel defines as one who gets well unexpectedly. Patients are charged for an initial, intensive, intake session, and for group and individual sessions thereafter. All services are available on a sliding scale if a cancer patient cannot afford their cost. ECaP states that its psychotherapy is in addition to, not in place of, mainstream medical care, and that no medical advice is offered to participants (293). ECaP also serves as an information resource; according to its patient literature, more than 750 people from all over the country write or call ECaP each week seeking information (803). It can supply books, audio- and videotapes, and reading lists. ECaP also keeps track of other centers that offer similar services and may refer callers to facilities in their vicinity. In an effort to further expand the availability of its services, about once a month ECaP offers intensive, two- day training sessions for people interested in setting up similar groups (which can be called ECaP-like groups, as there is only one ECaP center). As of early 1990, approximately 160 people had received this training (293). Another model support program is the Commonweal Cancer Help Program, which was started in 1985 in Bolinas, California. Michael Lerner, Ph.D., Commonweal's president, and Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D., medical director, organize groups of 8 to 12 patients for intense, week-long sessions aimed at helping patients cope with stress and resolve fears and anxieties (particularly about pain, illness, and death), and improve the quality of their lives. The main purpose of the sessions is to help cancer patients \"discover those inner and outer conditions under which they may best maximize their health and wellbeing\" (744). Commonweal retreats are held in a rustic oceanside center about an hour drive north of San Francisco. The retreat staff includes the director, a co-director who is a psychologist trained in cancer work, a yoga teacher, a vegetarian cook and art teacher, and a massage staff. The program includes a cognitive or informational component and a multifaceted lifestyle component. Commonweal offers participants access to its library of books and articles from the medical and popular literature dealing with cancer treatment and research. The remainder of its program offers patients a daily regimen designed to release stress and encourage personal expression of feelings. The program includes small group sessions, lectures, massage, yoga, training in relaxation and stress reduction techniques, meditation, imagery, walks in nature, journal and dream work, reflection, and other forms of artistic expression and personal exploration. Commonweal's directors believe that these activities \u2014exercise, healthful diet, deep relaxation, opportunity for personal expression, access to information and caring support \u2014release fear and stress and enable patients to identify a lifestyle and healing path that are is best for them (532,744). The majority of the participants in the program have been women, and the relatively low cost of the retreat has allowed people from varying backgrounds to attend. Generally, participants have heard about the program through physicians, other health care providers, or previous participants. People interested in the program are screened by the coordinator to ensure that they understand the nature of the program, can work well with a small group, and are able to take care of themselves. Participants must also be under the care of a physician and understand fully that the program is not itself a complete treatment (532). Psychoneuroimmunology It is often suggested in the popular literature that various types of behavioral intervention designed to reduce stress or to promote positive mental images act by enhancing the immune system. Since the immune system is the body's primary defense against many diseases, its enhancement is commonly linked with reducing the susceptibility to cancer or with enhancing the ability to fight cancer. Unfortunately, the actual relationships among emotions, immunity, and disease are still poorly understood, despite a large body of literature on the subject spanning several decades. Within the last ten years, however, new evidence has emerged concerning the biological basis of interrelationships among personality, emotion, behavior, immune alterations, neuroendocrinology, and the onset and progression of disease. The relatively new interdisciplinary field of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) encompasses these diverse areas of research (11,358,461). One of the catalysts for the recent interest in PNI research was the discovery by Ader and colleagues that immune functions in experimental animals could be altered by behavioral changes (13). That observation provided evidence that the immune system did not function completely autonomously, as was previously thought, but that other biological processes, e.g., neurologic and endocrine factors, could directly modulate immune function. Recent PNI research has revealed a number of biochemical and neurological connections between the immune system and the central nervous system. Their clinical significance, however, is still unclear (14,230,358,817). For many years, certain types of cancer have been thought to be influenced by immune processes, although the nature and extent of these influences are still only partially understood. Experimental animal data suggest that tumors induced by viruses or ultraviolet radiation appear to elicit immune responses (via antigen-specific T-lymphocytes) that act against those particular tumor cells. However, the majority of cancers of internal organs (not induced by viruses or ultraviolet radiation) are apparently not affected by T-cell-mediated immunity (488), although they could be susceptible to other immune processes in ways that are also poorly understood. Burnet's widely known immune surveillance theory (112), which proposes that one function of the immune system is to recognize and destroy malignant cells as they arise, has gradually been modified and expanded to take into account broader possibilities for additional types of immune action against malignant cells (488). Attempts to measure and interpret alterations in immune function are central elements of many current PNI studies. Investigators have tried various ways of testing the hypothesis that the immune system mediates among emotions, personality, behavior, and disease onset and progression. However, a major difficulty in interpreting the significance of alterations in particular immune functions is that the clinical implications \u2014benefit or impairment with regard to disease \u2014are not yet known (93). A statistically significant increase in circulating levels of disease-fighting cells could, for instance, reflect normal variability, or could have only short-term effects, or could be compensated for by changes in other immune processes (93). The critical associations needed to interpret immune system alterations and changes in cancer onset or progression have not been demonstrated (12,461,564,834). For the most part, PNI research has focused on correlations between psychosocial characteristics, such as personality, emotions, and stress, and specific biochemical measures of immune function, or between psychosocial characteristics and disease onset and progression. A handful of studies have been carried out to assess possible effects of psychological interventions on immune function or on disease onset and progression. So far, PNI research on links between psychosocial characteristics and disease has suggested that stress, or the ways in which individuals cope with stress, may influence immune function. It is not known if stress acts directly, via physiologic processes, or indirectly, via altered health-related behaviors, such as alcohol drinking, a poor diet, lack of exercise, etc. Of critical importance, it is not known whether these altered immune responses are directly linked to the onset or progression of cancer (564). Other studies have examined effects of psychosocial factors on the risk of disease onset. There are conflicting data on relationships between psychosocial factors, e.g. \"cancer-prone personalities,\" and cancer onset and progression. For instance, clinical depression has been found to have little or no effect on the risk of developing cancer in large segments of the population (300,990). A recent review of these studies concluded that \"the results of prospective studies [on psychosocial risk factors and cancer onset] do not yet permit firm conclusions about the cancer-prone personality\" (564). Many studies have examined effects of psychosocial factors on the course of cancer, with mixed results. In general, four types of factors have been examined: adjusting to illness, emotional expression, will to live, and emotional stress. A number of studies have reported correlations between one or more of these factors and cancer outcome (542,735). A recent study of 36 women with recurrent breast cancer found that signs of joyful attitudes were associated with longer disease-free intervals (543). Two other recent studies did not find a correlation between psychosocial factors and length of survival or time to relapse in patients with advanced disease (176,460). At present, one of the most controversial areas of PNI research concerns effects of behavioral interventions on immune function and cancer. Preliminary evidence suggests that some psychological or behavioral interventions, such as hypnosis (370) and relaxation (476), can alter immune function in healthy individuals. Another study in progress is examining effects of relaxation and imagery techniques on immune function in cancer patients (808). Whether psychological and behavioral methods may influence the onset or progression of cancer is still an open question. Studies that have approached this issue are discussed in the last section of this chapter. Unconventional Use of Psychological and Behavioral Approaches in Cancer Treatment Psychological and behavioral interventions for which an assertion of tumor reduction or life extension is made involve relatively few techniques. As discussed above, these same approaches are also used for helping patients reduce pain or distress, and in most of these cases are not claimed to have a direct anti-cancer effect. Given the popularity of psychological interventions for a wide range of purposes, the unconventional use of these methods appears to be a relatively small, but quite visible, part of the overall field. This section summarizes information on the psychological approaches that are most prominently associated with direct anti-cancer claims in the popular and professional literature. Three techniques are discussed: the psychotherapeutic method developed by Lawrence LeShan, meditation as described by the late Ainslie Meares, and imagery and visualization as developed by the Simontons. These approaches are the best documented examples and are the ones cancer patients are most likely to hear about, even though many other practitioners have adopted and modified them. There is overlap in practice among imagery, meditation, and a variety of other self-regulation techniques, such as relaxation, hypnosis, and biofeedback. Hypnosis, for instance, is probably very similar to meditation and imagery in its effect on consciousness (669,844). It is commonly stated in the popular literature that these psychological techniques facilitate the achievement of a particular state of consciousness, and thereby enhance the immune system and the body's natural healing abilities. As discussed in the previous section, PNI research is just beginning to address this issue. LeShan's Psychotherapy One of the most prominent examples of an unconventional psychological approach is a form of one-on-one psychotherapy developed by Lawrence LeShan, a researcher and clinical psychologist, as an adjunct to conventional treatment for cancer patients. LeShan's two most prominent books (537,539) explain the basis for his view that patients with advanced, metastatic disease can sometimes undergo tumor regression and can sometimes increase the length and quality of their lives under his psychotherapeutic regimen (538). His conclusions are based on personal experience over several decades with patients he has treated. LeShan received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and began clinical research in 1952 at the Institute for Applied Biology in New York. He has published widely in psychological literature. For many years, his research focused on relationships among personality factors, traumatic life events, and cancer onset and progression. In his earlier research, he focused on the notion of a \"cancer- prone personality\" and concluded that the interplay between personality and events can so weaken the body's cancer defense mechanism that a cancer is likely to appear (537,538,539). The approach LeShan describes in his 1989 book, Cancer as a Turning Point, is a psychotherapeutic process used to identify the creative potential and self-healing ability of each patient. LeShan attempts to develop \"the perception and the expression of the individual's special song to sing in life\" and \"the cause of his or her loss of contact with enthusiasm and joy\" (537). He describes his method as a process of self-examination and growth that delves deeply into the patient's past in order to \"analyze the blocks that keep the patient from being able to live out his or her true nature\" (537). Rejecting a traditional Freudian psychoanalytic approach early on in his career (537), LeShan chose instead to find ways of helping cancer patients make their disease a \"turning point\" in their lives, an opportunity to fulfill their dreams. LeShan explains this guidance toward inner development and fulfillment in the following way: What is right with this person? What are his (or her) special and unique ways of being, relating, creating, that are his own and natural ways to live? What is his special music to beat out in life, his unique song to sing so that when he is singing it he is glad to get up in the morning and glad to go to bed at night? What style of life would give him zest, enthusiasm, involvement? How can we work together to find these ways of being, relating, and creatino What has blocked their perception and/or expression in the past? How can we work together so that the person moves more and more in this direction until he is living such a full and zestful life that he has no more time or energy for psychotherapy? (537) LeShan believes that some cancer patients have undergone tumor regression and have increased the length of their lives as a result of his psychotherapeutic approach. He states his conclusion this way (537): Ever since I learned how to use this approach some twenty years ago, approximately half of my 'hopeless,' 'terminal,' patients have gone into long-term remission and are still alive. The lives of many others seemed longer than standard medical predictions would see as likely. Nearly all found that working in this new way improved the 'color' and the emotional tone of their lives and made the last period of their lives far more exciting and interesting than they had been before starting the therapeutic process. Speculating that the psychotherapy might bring about changes in patients' immune function, LeShan writes that his treatment is often \"sufficient to halt or reverse the direction of growth of a serious neoplasm.\" He believes that \"if we recover our hope for the ability to live our own life\" our \"cancer-defense mechanism [will] recover its strength and come to the aid of the medical program. As we move toward living this life, [our] own self-healing powers [will] act more strongly and raise our 'host-resistance' to the cancer\" (537). Meditation Meditation can be defined as \"any activity that keeps the attention pleasantly anchored in the present moment\" (92). Although there are many forms of meditation, one common feature is the absence or near absence of logical thought and emotional experience (608). Different approaches to meditation may consist of quieting the mind, concentrating on a single subject such as breathing or a repeated word, observing passing thoughts, or visualizing active healing processes (a process similar to the practice of imagery, described below). The purpose of meditating is not primarily to relax, although relaxation may be a side effect of meditating, but to raise awareness, which is seen as the prerequisite to \"getting the mind back under control\" (92). By calming the body and fixing the mind through \"dropping the anchor of attention,\" meditation is believed to be an important tool of self-healing and self-regulation (92). In the 1970s and early 1980s, meditation directed against tumors received public attention as a result of the work of the late Ainslie Meares, an Australian psychiatrist. Meares used a form of meditation aimed at producing a profound stillness of mind (608). He characterized the practice as one of simplicity and naturalness (609). Cancer patients reportedly experienced \"a profound and prolonged reduction\" in anxiety and a nonverbal understanding of life and death (609). Meares believed that intensive meditation enabled the immune system to function more effectively by inducing changes in blood supply to particular parts of the body and in endocrine function and neural activity\" (610). Based on his experience treating 73 patients with advanced cancer who attended at least 20 sessions of intensive meditation, Meares believed his treatment reduced anxiety, depression, discomfort, and pain in about half his patients. Meares believed that intensive meditation was associated with tumor regression in at least 10 percent of the advanced cancer patients he treated (607). He also published a number of case reports of regression of cancer after intensive meditation and in the absence of conventional treatment (603,604,605,606). (These cases are summarized in (608).) Imagery and Visualization Imagery refers to various psychological techniques that involve the creation and interpretation of mental images (6). It has been described as a tool for communicating with the subconscious mind (583). Imagery can be used as a tool for articulating ideas, beliefs, and experiences and for replacing fears and negative expectations with positive ideas and beliefs. In cancer treatment, guided imagery often consists of visualizing the symbolic destruction of cancer cells and has been used to reinforce patients' beliefs in their ability to recover. Other imagery techniques used in cancer treatment, e.g., gentle imagery, focus on imagining peaceful, pleasant scenes (102). Imagery is often used along with relaxation, meditation, or hypnosis. A broad psychological approach to cancer treatment centering on the use of imagery was popularized in the 1970s by O. Carl Simonton, a radiation oncologist, and Stephanie Simonton-Atchley, a psychotherapist. The Simontons' best- selling 1978 book, Getting Well Again (583), described their clinical experience treating cancer patients with imagery and other psychological approaches at the Cancer Counseling and Research Center in Dallas (continued now at the Simonton Cancer Center in Pacific Palisades, CA). Their regimen was described as a \"whole-person approach to cancer treatment\" and included interventions designed to \"restore the physical, mental, and emotional balance so that the whole person returns to health\" (583). The rationale was reportedly based on theories concerning the role of personality characteristics and psychological factors in the etiology of cancer. Relaxation and mental imagery were presented as tools for cancer patients to motivate themselves to recover their health and to make creative changes in other areas of their lives. Overall, the regimen was presented as an adjunctive approach to conventional cancer treatment, but claims for direct antitumor effects were also made (see below). The process of imagery, as outlined by the Simontons, begins with a period of relaxation. The patient is then instructed to visualize the tumor as a weak, disorganized, soft mass of cells. Conventional treatment is visualized as powerful and effective, capable of shrinking tumors and helping the patient overcome the disease. The patient is encouraged to visualize defending himself or herself against cancer through a strong and aggressive immune system, a symbol of the body's natural healing processes. White blood cells are visualized as a vast army of defenders easily overwhelming the weak malignant cells. Dead and dying cells are visualized as being flushed out of the body by natural processes, until no more tumor cells remained. The patient is then instructed to imagine himself or herself as healthy, energetic, and fulfilled (583). The Simontons recommended that cancer patients repeat the process three times a day. According to the Simontons, the process of relaxation and imagery reportedly helped patients lessen fears, tension, and stress; change attitudes; strengthen the will to live; confront depression, hopelessness, and helplessness; and gain a sense of confidence and optimism (583). It was also believed that relaxation and imagery could \"effect physical changes, enhancing the immune system and altering the course of a malignancy\" (583). The Simontons claimed significant life extension as a result of relaxation and imagery techniques. The claim was apparently based on a preliminary analysis of their patients compared with national statistics, as explained in the following excerpt from Getting Well Again: In the past four years, we have treated 159 patients with a diagnosis of medically incurable malignancy. Sixty-three of the patients are alive, with an average survival time of 24.4 months since the diagnosis. Life expectancy for this group, based on national norms, is 12 months. A matched control population is being developed and preliminary results indicate survival comparable with national norms and less than half the survival time of our patients. With the patients in our study who have died, their average survival time was 20.3 months. In other words, the patients in our study who are alive have lived, on the average, two times longer than patients who received medical treatment alone. Even those patients in the study who have died still lived one and one-half times longer than the control group (583). In a 1980 paper describing an uncontrolled, exploratory study, the Simontons used a similar approach to describe outcomes in another, possibly overlapping, series of cancer patients (806). Out of 130 patients with breast, lung, or colon cancer, 75 patients with advanced disease were included in the analysis. Median survival time (the time at which half have died and half are still alive) since diagnosis was 35 months for the 33 breast cancer patients, 21 months for the 18 colon cancer patients, and 14 months for the 24 lung cancer patients. These survival times were compared to published data on other groups of metastatic breast, colon, and lung cancer patients: 16, 11, and 6 months, respectively. The Simontons noted that their patients lived twice as long as those reported in the literature and speculated that better patient motivation, greater confidence in the treatment, and overall positive expectancy as a result of their regimen may have contributed to the results. The design of the Simontons' study was such that valid conclusions could not be drawn from it about increased survival as a result of relaxation and imagery, since other possible intervening variables were not accounted for. It is not known how the Simonton patients might have differed in physical and psychological characteristics from the patients with whom they were compared. Attempts at Evaluating Survival Outcomes Despite anecdotal reports of tumor regression or life extension in patients treated with imagery, meditation, or LeShan's psychotherapy, possible anticancer effects of these interventions in other patients have not been confirmed. Researchers in this area have, in general, focused more on the evaluation of quality of life issues than on anti-tumor effects. The few studies that have addressed the issue of survival \u2014one on Bernie Siegel's ECaP program, and two others on different forms of psychotherapy \u2014are summarized in this section. A study of the ECaP program was conducted in the early 1980s by Hal Morgenstern and colleagues in collaboration with Bernie Siegel (639). The study attempted to assess the impact of the ECaP program on survival of patients with breast cancer. The ECaP program consisted of groups of 8 to 12 participants who met once a week for 90 minutes. Sessions included discussions of patients' problems, meditation, and mental imagery using drawings. The investigators designed a retrospective followup study comparing survival in a group of 34 ECaP participants with a group of 102 nonparticipants. The group of patients to whom the ECaP participants were compared were matched for age at histologic diagnosis, stage of disease, surgery, and course of disease. The study found a small, nonsignificant increase in survival time among ECaP participants compared to nonparticipants. As noted in the published report, though, the study did not control for the lag period among ECaP participants from the time of diagnosis to the time of ECaP entry, a period that reportedly ranged from less than one month to ten years. Morgenstern and colleagues used two statistical methods to adjust for this error. In one case, the adjustment produced a result showing a nonsignificant positive effect on survival in these women, and in the other case, a nonsignificant negative effect on survival. A more important limitation in interpreting the results of this study is its overall design, in which an attempt was made to control retrospectively for known and unknown differences between the two groups of patients by a matching procedure. Despite the matching, there could still have been major differences in personal characteristics, treatment variables, and disease characteristics that were not or could not have been identified. For this reason, this type of study design is not generally considered acceptable for detecting effects on survival, unless the difference in survival between the treatment and control groups is so great as to outweigh the possible effects of bias or confounding. The effect of different forms of psychotherapy in women with metastatic breast cancer was evaluated by Ronald Grossarth-Maticek and colleagues (363). The study included 100 women, 50 of whom chose to receive chemotherapy and 50 of whom refused chemotherapy. Half of each group of 50 was randomized to receive psychotherapy or not. Little information is given on how the groups compared in stage at diagnosis, time to entry into the study, and other characteristics after randomization. The investigators found that the women randomized to psychotherapy survived 18.6 months following diagnosis compared with 12.6 months for women randomized to no psychotherapy. The results suggest there may have been a small survival benefit for patients participating in psychotherapy. Another randomized study evaluating the effect of psychotherapy on survival and quality of life of patients with metastatic breast cancer was recently described by David Spiegel and colleagues (824). In this study, psychotherapy consisted of weekly 90-minute supportive group sessions and self-hypnosis for pain control. The sessions were conducted for one year and were led by a psychiatrist or social worker and a therapist who herself had breast cancer in remission. Eighty-six women with metastatic breast cancer, who were also receiving conventional treatment, were randomized to psychotherapy or no psychotherapy (yielding 50 women in the treatment group and 36 in the control group). Patients in the two groups were comparable in age, marital status, type of surgery, degree of metastatic spread, number of mastectomies, exercise activity, and number of treatment courses. The groups did differ in stage of disease at initial diagnosis, with the psychotherapy group having fewer women with advanced disease. That difference was reportedly controlled for in the analysis of the data. Survival was measured nine years after psychotherapy ended. There was a significant difference in survival time between the two groups: women who underwent psychotherapy lived an average of 36.6 months after randomization to the intervention, while women in the control group lived an average of 18.9 months following randomization. Divergence in survival time between the two groups began to appear eight months after psychotherapy ended. Spiegel and colleagues also found that psychotherapy significantly reduced anxiety, depression, and pain among participants. The investigators suggested that involvement in the support group may have allowed patients to better mobilize their resources, to improve compliance with conventional treatment, or to improve their appetite and diet through reduced depression. They also suggested that patients who learned self-hypnosis for pain control may have been better able to remain physically active. The results of Spiegel's study lend support to the practice of psychotherapy in cancer treatment, but more information is needed before the practice could be adopted confidently on a broader scale. Spiegel's provocative findings are difficult to generalize to other types of psychosocial intervention and other patient populations, since the study included a relatively small number of subjects. One other factor limiting the interpretation of the results is the possibility that other, unidentified variables occurring during the 9-year followup period had some influence on survival time. The women in the study were not contacted after their initial year, and it was not known what other factors, e.g., further conventional treatment or psychosocial support, may have intervened during that time to create more differences between the groups. A larger randomized study will be needed to verify the results, and is clearly warranted by Spiegel's conclusions.

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-four-hundred-thirty-five) [OTA Report: Dietary Treatments](https://quackwatch.org/related/ota/ota03/) A specified diet is the primary component of some unconventional cancer treatments. This chapter reviews three examples of unconventional treatments with dietary regimens as the primary or central component: the treatment regimen developed by the late Max Gerson, MD, currently offered at a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico; the treatment regimen developed by William Kelley, DDS, and recently modified by Nicholas Gonzalez, MD, who treats patients in New York; and the macrobiotic regimen, whose educational resources and specialized food products are widely available to patients in the United States.

A specified diet is the primary component of some unconventional cancer treatments. This chapter reviews three examples of unconventional treatments with dietary regimens as the primary or central component: the treatment regimen developed by the late Max Gerson, MD, currently offered at a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico; the treatment regimen developed by William Kelley, DDS, and recently modified by Nicholas Gonzalez, MD, who treats patients in New York; and the macrobiotic regimen, whose educational resources and specialized food products are widely available to patients in the United States. Coffee enemas, which are included in two of these regimens, are also discussed separately in Box 3-B later. In other chapters of this report, treatments are described that also include dietary elements, but in those cases, the diet may be one of several major elements in the approach, with a non-nutritional treatment usually considered primary in the regimen. In the Livingston-Wheeler regimen (described in ch. 5), e.g., dietary guidelines are specified, but the regimen is centered on its original antiinfective treatment. In addition, many of the clinics in the United States and Mexico that promote \"metabolic\" treatment for cancer specify particular foods to include or avoid as part of a regimen that also includes pharmacologic and biologic agents, exercise, and spiritual and psychological components (289). Other dietary approaches used in unconventional cancer treatment for which more limited information is available are not covered in detail in this chapter. One of these is wheatgrass, a component of a regimen that has been available for several decades in the United States. Originally developed by Ann Wigmore, the wheatgrass regimen is advocated for prevention and treatment of a variety of conditions and for general health maintenance. Individuals attending one of three U.S. centers that offer instruction in following the wheatgrass regimen (289) are taught \"an enlightened approach to the understanding of health and various cleansing and rebuilding techniques to restore and/or maintain a vigorous life\" (198), according to promotional literature. One of the centers, the Hippocrates Health Institute in Florida, describes itself as a \"health resort\" offering \"a multi-dimensional program for the serious health seeker\" (405). The wheatgrass diet is described as a \"nutritional lifestyle that embraces an all natural way of eating\" (405). Using books and products commonly available in health food stores and through mail order houses, patients can also follow the wheatgrass regimen on their own. The wheatgrass regimen eliminates all meat, dairy products, and cooked foods from the diet, while emphasizing \"live foods\" (including uncooked sprouts, vegetables, fruits, nuts, \"detoxification\" (enemas and high colonics), enzyme supplements and chlorella (green algae tablets). Proponents believe that wheatgrass is the key element of the program and claim that it bolsters the immune system, kills harmful bacteria in the digestive system, and rids the body of waste matter and toxins (405,959). Anecdotal case reports of tumor regressions and life extension among cancer patients who followed the wheatgrass regimen have been published in the proponent literature (see, e.g., (344)), but thus far, no studies of its clinical role in the treatment of cancer have been reported. - General Comments about Unconventional Dietary Approaches - Compared with Other Forms of Nutritional Treatment By relying for the most part on vegetarian, low-fat, high- fiber foods, the dietary regimens described in this chapter share certain characteristics with the kinds of foods currently recommended by mainstream groups for lowering the risk of developing cancer and heart disease. Recent American Cancer Society guidelines for cancer prevention, e.g., suggest reducing the intake of fat, alcohol, and salt- cured and smoked foods, while increasing the intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains (681). One way they differ, however, is that the unconventional cancer treatment diets may emphasize a few particular foods and limit or totally eliminate others. The macrobiotic regimen, e.g., advises against consuming vegetables and fruits that are not grown locally, such as bananas and other tropical fruit, and against certain types of vegetable, such as those in the nightshade family (including tomatoes, green peppers, eggplants, e.g.). The wheatgrass diet excludes all cooked vegetables and fruits in favor of raw foods exclusively. The Kelley regimen emphasizes certain categories of foods, e.g., vegetables or red meat, over others, on an individual basis. (The Kelley diet does not necessarily conform to current mainstream dietary recommendations.) It has been noted that in some circumstances, cancer patients who follow overly restrictive diets of any kind, whether unconventional or not, may be at risk for malnutrition and uncontrolled weight loss (8,84). It has also been noted that diets that may be useful in preventing cancer are not necessarily effective in treating cancer, since substances in food that may play a role in the initiation of cancer may be different from those that may contribute to tumor progression (84). The goals of the unconventional dietary treatments also overlap with the goals of conventional nutritional support for cancer patients in that both try to counteract the metabolic and nutritional effects of the disease and of some forms of treatment. The unconventional treatments go beyond the conventional support measures, however, by claiming to reverse the course of the disease, to enhance host function, and to improve quality of life. The fact that the unconventional treatments specify particular dietary regimens for cancer patients at all, regardless of their condition, stage of disease, or type of tumor, separates them from mainstream cancer treatment. Nutritional support has a well-established place in conventional cancer treatment, but generally does not include dietary recommendations for patients with cancer. At present, no diet is recommended publicly by NCI or ACS for use in cancer treatment. In practice, patients are not commonly given nutritional advice at the time of diagnosis or initiation of treatment by mainstream physicians. Nutritional support in mainstream oncology focuses instead on the provision of nutrients under special and usually more extreme circumstances. Nutritional support given in conjunction with conventional cancer treatment often involves the use of total parenteral nutrition (nutrient solutions given intravenously) or enteral nutrition (nutrient solutions provided e.g., through a nasogastric tube). These measures are normally limited to cachexic patients in advanced stages of disease, for patients who have particular cancer- or treatment-related nutritional problems that prohibit normal intake of food, or for malnourished patients undergoing major surgery (34,473,798). It is well accepted that cancer and its treatment can cause malnutrition and that malnutrition itself predicts a poor outcome (253). A number of physiologic factors associated with cancer are believed to contribute to malnutrition, including the metabolic state of the tumor and its effects on the body's metabolism, catabolic effects of conventional treatment, and physiologic stress associated with rapid tissue growth and cell destruction (407), although the ways in which these factors influence nutritional status are still poorly understood. The issue of how to ensure that patients obtain an optimal daily intake of nutrients and calories in order to preserve lean body mass without stimulating tumor growth is considered unresolved (407). Total parenteral nutrition has been found to be of limited use, and in some cases even detrimental (798). In general, oral dietary treatments have not been evaluated for possible prevention of malnutrition or for possible effects on the course of the disease in cancer patients, although the initial stage of a multicenter study involving a low fat dietary intervention in patients with breast cancer was recently begun (35). Adjunctive Use of Dietary Approaches in Cancer Treatment (see footnote 1) The unconventional dietary treatments for cancer described in this chapter are also distinct from the adjunctive use of dietary treatment in other contexts, e.g., in the more numerous and diverse practices where physicians and other practitioners offer what is often referred to as \"alternative\" or \"holistic\" health care. The issue of dietary treatment in conjunction with conventional treatment by these practitioners is commonly raised in the popular literature, but detailed information is scarce. The actual dietary regimens, their rationales, and the outcomes have not yet been reported, so the extent and nature of their use cannot be characterized precisely. One practitioner's approach that is currently being developed as an adjunctive nutritional approach to cancer treatment is described in Box 3-A. It is unknown how representative that example is of other efforts to use nutritional approaches adjunctively. In the judgment of some of the members of the Advisory Panel for this project, however, the adjunctive use of dietary interventions in cancer treatment is gradually becoming incorporated into conventional treatment and becoming accepted as a potentially valuable supportive measure (8). The stated aim of such adjunctive nutritional treatment is to maintain adequate levels of critical nutrients (assisted by close monitoring for deficiencies and abnormalities) in order to enhance the patient's natural resistance to the disease, to increase the ability to respond to conventional treatment, to improve the patient's quality of life, and ultimately, to lengthen his or her survival time (84). A number of factors may be involved in stimulating efforts to combine nutritional intervention with cancer treatment before the development of overt deficiencies, metabolic abnormalities, and cachexia. One factor may be the public interest in self-help regimens and in health effects of diet, as shown by the wide range of books and articles in the popular literature concerning diet and cancer. This is paralleled by the large and expanding scientific literature on links between specific nutritional factors and cancer processes (361,660,661). There is strong evidence from laboratory and population studies suggesting a substantial dietary contribution to a large proportion of human cancers (866), though in some cases the data are not unequivocal and many specifics remain to be determined. Major efforts in this area at NCI are currently conducted in two research programs: the Chemoprevention Program, which focuses on the role of natural and synthetic micronutrients (such as beta carotene, vitamin A and related retinoids, vitamins C and E, and certain selenium compounds) in preventing or inhibiting cancer development; and the Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer Program, which focuses on macronutrient factors (such as fiber and fat) in cancer development (361). The Gerson Treatment The Gerson treatment, consisting of a low sodium, high potassium, vegetarian diet, various pharmacologic agents, and coffee enemas, is one of the most widely known unconventional cancer treatments. As one of the first unconventional approaches now commonly referred to as \"metabolic,\" (see footnote 2) it may have spawned the development of many other currently used unconventional dietary and pharmacologic approaches. Max Gerson, MD, a German-born physician, spent the last 23 years of his 50 year medical career in the United States. He died in 1959 leaving no apparent system in place to continue his treatment program. In 1977, Gerson's daughter, Charlotte Gerson Straus, co-founded (with Norman Fritz) the Gerson Institute now based in Bonita, California. The Institute oversees a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, where the Gerson treatment is offered. According to one outside report, that clinic treats approximately 600 patients per year (569). Background and Early Use Max Gerson was born in Germany in 1881 and graduated from the University of Freiburg medical school in 1907 (875). He practiced medicine in Germany, Austria, and France before emigrating to the United States in 1936. He received his New York medical license in 1938 and his U.S. citizenship in 1944 (875). He opened a private medical practice in New York City and in 1946 also began treating patients at nearby Gotham Hospital. Gerson was a member of the American Medical Association (AMA), the New York State Medical Society, and the Medical Society of the County of New York (875). In 1958, after a long investigation, the Medical Society of the County of New York suspended Gerson's membership. The Society charged that Gerson's participation in a 1946 radio broadcast, during which the show's commentator, Raymond Gram Swing, described beneficial results of Gerson's treatment for cancer, constituted personal advertising (387,465,956). Gerson reportedly also lost his hospital privileges and malpractice insurance (387,569), although no details of these actions are available. In 1946, during a hearing on a proposed bill to authorize increased Federal support for cancer research in general, Gerson testified before a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. In his statement to the subcommittee, Gerson described his background, the development of his treatment for cancer, and submitted written case histories of ten patients treated with his regimen, five of whom were questioned in person at the hearing (875). Gerson claimed that these patients were cured of advanced cancer as a result of his treatment. Both Gerson's testimony and radio appearance drew national attention. The same year, an editorial appeared in The Journal of the American Medical Association (J.A.M.A.) in response to numerous requests for information about Gerson. The editorial criticized Gerson and his sponsors at the Robinson Foundation, New York, for \"promotion of an unestablished, somewhat questionable method of treating cancer.\" The editorial stated AMA's view that Gerson had provided only \"clinical impressions as to benefits secured but nothing resembling scientific evidence as to the actual merit of the method\" (465). A 1949 report of the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry reiterated AMA's view of the Gerson treatment, concluding that \"there is no scientific evidence whatsoever to indicate that modification in the dietary intake of food or other nutritional essentials are of any specific value in the control of cancer\" (39). The American Cancer Society's Committee on Unproven Methods of Cancer Management published its first statement on the Gerson treatment in 1957 (90). While certain aspects of Gerson's regimen-e.g., the intake of fresh fruits and vegetables and the reduction or elimination of sodium and fat-are consistent with current knowledge about reducing the risk of contracting certain types of cancer and other illnesses, Gerson's thesis that regression of cancer can result from dietary treatment and \"detoxification\" is generally regarded as unconfirmed. Rationale for the Treatment Gerson developed his dietary treatment over the course of several decades. His approach was largely empirical. By his own account, he tried variations and combinations of foods and other agents on his patients, noted the ones that reacted favorably, and adjusted subsequent patients' regimens accordingly (336). All along, he reasoned why some agents seemed to work while others did not and developed hypotheses to account for his observations. Gerson described the development of his treatment regimen and presented case histories of patients he believed were treated successfully in his 1958 book, A Cancer Therapy: Results of Fifty Cases (337), and in a number of published articles in German and in English (403). By the late 1950s, Gerson had produced an overall approach and rationale for treating cancer that appeared to be quite different from conventional medical thought and practice. It is unknown whether Gerson's formal medical training included study of the therapeutic use of diet (939). Early on in his medical career, he devised a dietary regimen to treat his own severe migraine headaches. After reported success with his condition, he used his diet in the treatment of a variety of other disorders, including skin tuberculosis (lupus vulgaris), asthma, pulmonary tuberculosis, and arthritis (337). In 1928, he began treating cancer patients with the diet he used on tuberculosis, at the insistence of a patient with cancer of the bile duct, who reportedly recovered following Gerson's treatment (336). By the time he established his practice in New York in the mid-1940s, he concentrated on treating cancer patients. His first paper published in English (see footnote 3) on dietary treatment for cancer appeared in 1945 (331). In that paper, Gerson outlined his high potassium, low sodium, fatless diet regimen, which included foods, mineral and vitamin supplements, and crude liver injections (preparations of raw calves liver). He reported on ten patients treated with the regimen in whom he observed improvements in \"general bodily health\" and, in some cases, tumor reduction. In a subsequent publication, Gerson described other agents that he added to the regimen, including an iodine solution (\"Lugol\"), thyroid extract, potassium solution, pancreatin, and vitamin C (333). Gerson noted that in six additional patients his treatment appeared to reduce inflammation around tumors, relieve pain, improve psychological condition, and provide at least temporary tumor regressions (333). In the mid-1950s, Gerson first published explanations of the components of his regimen and the rationale for their use, along with some of the clinical outcomes he observed. Gerson described cancer as a \"degenerative disease,\" fundamentally similar to many other disease states; he believed that an \"impaired metabolism\" was the underlying problem in degenerative disease and that proper liver function was critical to maintaining metabolic order (334). He believed that several physiologic functions were impaired in cancer patients, including the metabolism of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals; the activity of oxidative enzymes; and the activity of intestinal bacteria (335). Gerson believed that the impairment in these functions created an internal climate favorable to the growth of malignant cells (334). Gerson believed that his treatment regimen reversed the conditions he thought necessary to sustain the growth of malignant cells. He attached great importance to the elimination of \"toxins\" from the body and to the role of a healthy liver in recovery. Gerson noted that if the liver were damaged, e.g. by cancer or cirrhosis, the patient had little chance of recovery on his treatment regimen (333,337). He observed that patients who died showed a marked degeneration of the liver, which he presumed was due to unspecified toxic factors released into the bloodstream by the process of tumor regression. He believed that these toxic tumor breakdown products poisoned the liver and other vital organs (229). According to this view, Gerson believed that detoxification-preventing patients from dying of selfpoisoning-was the most important first step in treatment (336). In support of detoxification, he cited a passage from Hippocrates that described drinking a \"special soup\" and administering enemas (336). Gerson prescribed coffee enemas, initially at the frequency of one every three or four hours, as part of his cancer treatment regimen. He maintained that the coffee enemas helped to stimulate the flow of bile (336), thereby increasing the rate of excretion of toxic products from the body. Gerson believed that the need to detoxify resulted not only from the internal generation of poisonous substances but also from the external supply of toxins created by the use of insecticides and herbicides in commercial agriculture. Accordingly, his dietary regimen emphasized the use of food grown organically. He reasoned that treatment for cancer must replenish and detoxify the entire body to allow its innate healing mechanisms to be restored (337). Another central component of Gerson's approach concerned the balance of potassium and sodium in the body. An imbalance in the concentration of these substances contributes to the internal environment supporting the growth of tumors, Gerson believed. He sought to eliminate sodium in patients' diets and to supplement with potassium (in the forms of potassium gluconate, potassium phosphate, and potassium acetate). Several papers published since Gerson's death have elaborated on Gerson's ideas regarding physiologic implications of the potassium-sodium balance in cancer states. Those papers suggest various biological and theoretical rationales for Gerson's theory that potassium supplementation and sodium restriction act against tumor formation (229,551,590,991). The role of oxidation in the treatment of cancer was another central element of Gerson's theory. He believed that tumor cells thrive in an environment depleted of oxygen and can be destroyed when oxidative reactions occur. He believed it was essential to supply intact oxidative enzymes in the diet, in the form of vegetable and fruit juices prepared by a stainless steel grinder and press (rather than by centrifugal juicers or liquefiers, which he believed destroyed the foods' oxidative enzymes) (336). He also recommended avoiding food that had been canned, processed, bottled, powdered, frozen, or cooked in aluminum pots (336). The combined effect of these treatment components was intended to \"normalize the biological function of damaged cells\" (334). Gerson wrote: . . . the end result is to return the body to its physiologic functions as they existed before the development of malignancies. In this state of the normal metabolism, abnormal cells are suppressed and harmless again (334). Current Gerson Treatment Regimen Current patient literature from the Gerson clinic states that the treatment \"restores the patient's healing mechanism so that the body can heal itself and overcome degenerative disease.\" In addition to treating patients with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and other diseases, the clinic also treats \"some people with no apparent serious disease [who] come to the Center simply to detoxify and build themselves up in order to feel good, to improve their health, and to prevent disease\" (329). The regimen is said to have two main components: 1) \"an intensive detoxification program to help the body eliminate toxins and waste materials which interfere with healing and metabolism\" and 2) \"an intensive nutrition program which floods the body and its cells with easily assimilated nutrients needed for improving the metabolism and healing\" (329). After a period of treatment at the clinic, each patient is instructed to continue the regimen at home for one and a half years or more \"until the liver, pancreas, oxidation, immune and other systems have been restored sufficiently to prevent the recurrence of cancer and other degenerative diseases\" (329). At present, the dietary part of the Gerson treatment offered at the clinic consists of low-sodium, low-fat, low-animal protein and high-carbohydrate foods, with vitamin and mineral supplements. The diet relies on large amounts of fresh and raw fruits and vegetables. Until late 1989, raw fresh calves liver juice was included in the regimen (see discussion below). The current patient brochure lists the dietary components as: \"13 glasses daily of various fresh raw juices prepared hourly from organically grown fruits and vegetables\" and \"three full vegetarian meals, freshly prepared from organically grown vegetables, fruits, and whole grains\" (328). The Gerson treatment also consists of a variety of other substances, including potassium supplements, thyroid hormone, Lugol's solution (an inorganic solution of iodine plus potassium iodide), injectable crude liver extract with vitamin B12, pancreatic enzymes, and enemas of coffee or chamomile tea (317,328). Other treatments, beyond the ones Gerson specified, have been added to the current protocol in recent years. According to materials distributed by the Gerson Institute, these substances include: - ozone treatment (328) (given by enema (318) or via infusion in autologous, heparinized blood or directly into patients' blood vessels (401)) - hydrogen peroxide (topically, rectally, or orally) (328) - intravenous \"GKI drip\" (glucose, potassium, and insulin solutions) (328) - \"live cell therapy\" (328) - castor oil (328) - clay packs (328) - Lincoln bacteriophage (a vaccine made from killed Staphylococcus aureus bacteria) and influenza virus vaccine, both reportedly to stimulate \"allergic inflammation,\" a process Gerson believed contributed to healing (387), and - laetrile (328,329). The Gerson treatment is time-consuming and restrictive, and can be difficult to follow in areas where fresh fruits and vegetables are not widely available (530). To assist with the rigors of the treatment, the clinic advises patients to have a \"helper,\" since patients \"need time and energy and rest to heal and if they do the therapy alone it will reduce their chances of healing\" (325). Potential and Reported Adverse Effects Two aspects of the Gerson treatment have attracted attention as possible causes of adverse effects-the use of raw calves liver juice, and coffee enemas. Ingestion of raw calves liver juice has been associated with infection with Campylobacter fetus subspecies fetus, an organism that is carried in the intestinal tract of cattle and sheep. Infection with C. fetus subsp. fetus is treatable if detected early, but can lead to sepsis and death if undetected or inadequately treated (339). An outbreak of C. fetus subsp. fetus infection among cancer patients, some of whom were thought to have been treated with the Gerson regimen, was reported in 1981 (339). Between January 1979 and March 1981, nine cancer patients and one lupus patient with sepsis were reported to the San Diego County Department of Health Services. C. fetus subsp. fetus was isolated from blood cultures from nine patients and from peritoneal fluid from one patient. Upon admission to the hospital, five of the patients were comatose and all had severe electrolyte abnormalities. The nine cancer patients died shortly after admission (338). After learning of the outbreak from a newspaper article, members of the Gerson staff contacted the San Diego Department of Health Services to discuss the problem, assuming from the description of treatments taken that at least some of the ten patients had been treated at the Gerson clinic (401). Acknowledging the possible link between the raw liver juice and the Campylobacter infection in these patients, Gerson staff subsequently improved the handling and storage of the calves liver to reduce the likelihood of contamination and instituted routine tests for C. fetus among their patients at the first sign of infection; patients testing positive would then be treated with an appropriate antibiotic (e.g., erythromycin) (401). No further reports of this type of infection in Gerson patients have been published in the literature. The clinic discontinued the use of raw liver juice in late 1989, however, because of potential problems with infection (326). Coffee enemas have been associated with serious fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, although none have been reported specifically in patients undergoing the Gerson regimen. One report in the literature noted the death of two Seattle women, one of whom had cancer, due to fluid and electrolyte abnormalities following coffee enemas (273). One of these women reportedly took ten or twelve coffee enemas in one night, and continued at a rate of one per hour, while the other woman took them four times daily; in both cases, the enemas were taken much more frequently than is recommended in the Gerson treatment. Another report of serious adverse effects associated with coffee enemas cited three cases (579). The overall risk of fatal electrolyte disturbance associated with coffee enemas is unknown, and may depend to some extent on frequency and conditions of use (see also discussion in Box 3-B). Claims of Effectiveness Gerson wrote (and rewrote, after the original was lost) A Cancer Therapy: Results of Fifty Cases to show that \"there is an effective treatment of cancer, even in advanced cases\" (337). In testimony before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 1946, Gerson estimated that about 30 percent of \"hopeless cases\" of cancer he treated showed a favorable response (875). In a lecture Gerson gave in 1956 (published posthumously in 1978) (336), and in a paper published in 1954, he estimated that his treatment produced \"positive results in about 50 percent of so-called generalized, regrowing or final cases\" (334). The current practitioners of the regimen also claim success with the treatment. Patient literature from the Gerson Institute claims: . . . the Gerson Therapy is able to achieve almost routine recoveries in early to intermediate cancers. Even when the disease is advanced and incurable by conventional standards (i.e. involves the liver or pancreas or multiple internal sites) excellent results are possible. The Gerson Therapy has cured many cases of advanced cancer in man (329). [Emphasis in original.] Further, the patient literature states that even for patients with both cancer and other diseases (such as arthritis, heart disease, and diabetes), the Gerson treatment \"usually heals the body of all diseases simultaneously\" (329). This claim is reportedly based on Gerson's belief that the body \"will not heal cancer and yet leave arthritis or arteriosclerosis or diabetes unimproved\" and that \"when the body's ability to heal is restored, the 'physician within' will set about to mend and restore the whole patient\" (329). The vice president of the Gerson Institute, Norman Fritz, republished a book by S.J. Haught (the pen name for Robert Lichello, a writer for the National Enquirer in the 1950s), which was originally titled Has Dr. Max Gerson a True Cancer Cure? (1962), renaming it Cancer? Think Curable! The Gerson Therapy (1983). In his introduction to the revised edition, Fritz claims that the Gerson treatment \"can save about 50 percent or more of advanced 'hopeless' cancer patients\" and that \"the percentage who recover can exceed 90 percent for early cancers and some 'early terminal' cancers.\" Fritz's claims are apparently not made by others in the Gerson Institute, but the Haught book is still widely available to patients and is one of the most easily accessible sources of information about the treatment (401). The Gerson Institute's newsletter often describes case histories of patients believed to be cured through the Gerson treatment (see, e.g., a description of \"cure of a partially removed, inoperable, radiation-resistant, adult astrocytoma through the Gerson Therapy\" (327)). Attempts at Evaluating the Gerson Treatment Since the 1940s, there have been several attempts by a number of groups and individuals to assess the effects of Gerson's regimen, and at least one attempt is currently in progress. Gerson's Case Presentations In 1947, Gerson submitted ten case histories of cancer patients treated with his regimen to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for review (332,822). The only available information about that review comes from a current NCI statement on the Gerson treatment, which states that the NCI review \"found no convincing evidence of effectiveness, particularly since the patients were also receiving other anticancer treatments\" (893). It was also noted that Gerson \"was invited to submit additional data but did not do so.\" Further information about the nature of the 1947 review is unavailable, since NCI cannot locate any records concerning it (766). In 1959, NCI reviewed 50 case histories presented in Gerson's book A Cancer Therapy: Results of Fifty Cases. NCI concluded that, in the majority of cases, the basic criteria for evaluating clinical benefit were not met. These criteria were the following: - the patient must have histologic verification of the presence of a malignant neoplasm, and the diagnostic sections must be available for independent review to verify Gerson's diagnosis. - if the patient had surgical resection or other previous treatment for a proven malignant neoplasm, the presence of a recurrence or metastasis also must be verified histologically and the sections made available for review. - if the patient had been previously treated, he must be completely reevaluated and observed for a long enough period of time to verify that this treatment was ineffective, and that the neoplasm is indeed advancing (60). NCI concluded overall that Gerson's data provided no demonstration of benefit (60,897). In an undated rebuttal, members of the Gerson Institute disputed NCI's 1959 findings, taking issue with almost every case assessment and charging that NCI dismissed legitimate evidence on the basis of technicalities (330). No independent assessment of the review has been made. The Austrian Study An exploratory study of the clinical effects of some components of the Gerson regimen is currently under way in Austria. According to an unpublished interim report (522), Peter Lechner, MD, of the Second Department of Surgery of the Landeskrankenhaus in Graz, Austria, is conducting a study using a modified Gerson regimen as an adjunctive treatment. The modified regimen is described as a high fiber, low sodium, high iodine and potassium, lactovegetarian diet with regular coffee enemas. It reportedly omits certain elements of the original Gerson regimen, such as liver juice, thyroid supplements (unless the patient is hypothyroid), and niacin supplements. It also limits the number of coffee enemas to two per day; Lechner noted in previous experience with patients following the Gerson regimen that a higher frequency of enemas was associated with the development of colitis (inflammation of the large intestine, often leading to diarrhea) in some patients. Twenty-nine patients who chose to follow the modified Gerson regimen were included in the study. An equal number of non- participating patients, matched for tumor type and stage of illness, were paired with the patients following the regimen. Nineteen pairs of patients with breast cancer, 8 pairs with colorectal cancer, and 4 pairs with malignant melanoma were studied. All patients reportedly had previous mainstream treatment (surgery and possibly other treatments) and some of them were taking them concurrently (chemotherapy, radiation, or interferon). While some of the patients are described as having metastatic disease and in advanced stages of illness, the report does not indicate whether all patients had measurable disease at the start of the study or whether previous or concurrent treatment was considered to have had an antitumor effect in any of the patients. Lechner reported that patients following the modified Gerson regimen showed no side effects attributable to the treatment and did not become malnourished. One of the patients with inoperable liver metastases who followed the Gerson treatment showed a temporary regression. In Lechner's opinion, there were subjective benefits from the modified Gerson regimen: patients needed less pain medication, were in better psychological condition, and experienced less severe side effects of chemotherapy than did the patients with whom they were compared. Without claiming definitive results, Lechner stated that the patients with breast and colon cancer with liver metastases benefited more than others in the study. According to the report, those patients \"seem to live longer, and their quality of life is apparently better\" than patients with whom they were compared, although he noted that his conclusions were subjective and \"of no statistical relevance at all.\" Lechner's description indicates that the study was not designed to generate definitive conclusions about changes in survival or in quality of life among patients following the modified Gerson regimen. The fact that the patients following the regimen chose to undergo a relatively rigorous and demanding program suggests that there may well be differences between those patients and the ones who did not participate in the program. In this case, the comparison between participating and nonparticipating patients does not provide a legitimate basis for judging differences in tumor response, survival, or quality of life. In addition, based on the information provided in the report, it is impossible to separate the effects of the modified Gerson regimen from the effects of previous or concurrent treatments. The study does, however, provide preliminary qualitative information on the experiences of the 29 patients who followed a modified Gerson regimen along with conventional treatment. It is unclear from the report how much longer the study would continue or what endpoints were being measured. The British Review In 1989, three British researchers visited the Gerson Clinic on behalf of a British medical insurance company (805) \"to assess its basis as a claimed dietary cure for cancer\" (459). The investigators observed patients and their treatment freely and were offered information from the clinic's files on a group of patients considered by the Gerson Staff to represent \"best responses\" to the Gerson treatment. They conducted two studies: the first was a review of the best responses, and the second was a psychological study of patients at the clinic at the time of the visit. For the review, the investigators were presented with 149 cases from among all patients treated at the clinic since it opened in 1977. Of those, 27 were alive and well and had sufficient documentation for assessment. Nearly all had had mainstream treatment of some kind before beginning the Gerson regimen, and a number continued to receive it in addition to the Gerson treatment. The investigators reported that nine of the patients had melanomas, and the course of their disease \"fell within what we would consider the limits of the 'natural history' of this disease.\" Two patients reportedly had early stage prostate cancers which had been removed surgically, and their survival was also judged to be consistent with what would have been expected without further treatment. Another patient with prostate cancer having \"clinically significant disease\" had survived beyond the expectation of the investigators, given his disease and prior treatment. Two patients with breast cancer and two with endometrial cancer were considered to have had disease courses consistent with their cancer and other treatment. A third patient with biopsy-proven endometrial cancer who had had no conventional treatment subsequently underwent a hysterectomy, at which time no evidence of malignancy remained, representing a case of tumor regression. One patient with non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) had extensive radiation treatment, which would have accounted for a favorable outcome, and another had no followup scans, so tumor status could not be determined. In another patient with low-grade NHL, a biopsy-confirmed mass regressed with no other treatment. The remaining patients were described as having \"slowly progressive disease.\" The investigators concluded: Although several of these cases would have been expected to have a poor prognosis on the basis of their histology and stage...a proportion of poor prognosis patients do fare better than the average. Any large series of 6,000 poor prognosis patients treated conventionally would produce similar results. A small number of the patients appear to have had disease regression that cannot be explained as being an extreme of the natural history of the disease. There may thus be a small antitumor effect in some patients. However, it must be stressed, if the anticancer effect of the Gerson Therapy was substantial, we would have expected to find evidence of a larger number of responses-if an effective new anti-cancer treatment had been given to 6,000 patients we would expect it to have been easier to find successful cases to present. In the second study, fifteen patients completed a questionnaire that elicited information about their background and disease history and their feelings about their physicians, their physical and mental health, the Gerson Clinic, and their interpersonal relationships. It was found that, in general, the patients had very positive feelings and experiences; they felt well supported by family and other patients at the clinic, had a \"high degree of control over their health,\" and had high \"mood\" and \"confidence\" scores. The investigators noted particularly that none of the patients was taking opiates for pain, though several had taken them previously, and they had low \"pain\" scores. The investigators concluded overall that there was a \"significant subjective benefit\" to patients and their families from the treatment: The nature of the therapy requires a positive contribution to be made by the patient to his or her health and meets a need not satisfied by conventional therapy. There are therefore lessons for oncologists to learn in the management of desperate cancer patients and their families. Gerson Institute Case Review An effort to document possible tumor remissions among patients treated at the Gerson clinic in Tijuana is currently being conducted under the direction of Gar Hildenbrand of the Gerson Institute (402). Since 1987 (400), a \"best case\" review has been in progress to assemble relevant data from Gerson patients believed to have benefited from the treatment. As planned, the review would include patients who either had no previous treatment or who failed previous treatment, and would collect details from each patient's medical records (including all cancer-related discharge summaries, pathology reports, slides, radiology summaries, films, laboratory reports, and surgery summaries). Provision was made for blind reevaluation of the pathology material by the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and of the medical records by experts at the University of California at Los Angeles. Where necessary, followup evaluations on patients would be conducted (including scans or other evaluative procedures). The collected data would then be reviewed by an expert panel to determine whether objective responses to the treatment had been documented. As of August 1989, OTA had no further information on the status of the Institute's review. The Kelley Regimen In the 1960s, William Donald Kelley, an orthodontist by training, developed and publicized a nutritional program for cancer patients based on dietary guidelines, vitamin and enzyme supplements, and computerized metabolic typing. The Kelley regimen became one of the most widely known unconventional cancer treatments. Although Kelley is no longer practicing his treatment, the regimen has been continued in a variety of forms by his followers. There are three distinct phases or interpretations of the Kelley program: the first, which Kelley described in his book One Answer to Cancer; the second, Fred Rohe's expansion and reinterpretation as published in his book Metabolic Ecology; and the third, Nicholas Gonzalez's metabolic typology based on Kelley's ideas, which is currently being offered by Gonzalez in New York. Background and Rationale In 1964, Kelley was told he had metastatic pancreatic cancer, although he reported that the diagnosis was never confirmed by biopsy. Applying one of his own \"biochemical tests\" (one of which he called the \"Protein Metabolism Evaluation Index,\" a test intended to diagnose cancer before it was clinically apparent), he concluded that he had had cancer for several months, if not years, and that his wife and two of his three children also had cancer (472). Kelley claims that his doctor told him he had two months to live and advised surgery, which Kelley refused. Based on his own experience, he felt that the wrong foods caused tumors to grow, while proper foods allowed the body to fight off the tumor. By trial and error, he regulated self-administered doses of various enzymes, vitamins, and minerals to achieve his recovery. He proceeded to apply his dietary program to his family and others, and eventually published his recommendations and the beliefs underlying them in a 1969 book entitled One Answer to Cancer (472), which achieved a wide distribution. In his book, Kelley wrote that cancer represented \"nothing more than a type of placenta growing at the wrong place and time in the body.\" He characterized cancer as a deficiency disease-a deficiency of active pancreatic enzymes, in particular. He believed that an indication of inadequate protein metabolism signified early stages of cancer and that cancer could be controlled by supplying adequate doses of pancreatic enzymes, a key component of his \"ecological\" treatment (472). He claimed that this treatment could halt the growth of tumors from within 3 hours to 12 days of initiation. The difficult part, he concluded, was clearing the body of accumulated toxins and the toxic poisons that are released as the tumors are dissolved and excreted (472). Development and Use of the Treatment Kelley described his treatment as ecological since \"the total person and his total environment must be considered in order to give proper treatment.\" The program consisted of five components: taking sufficient nutritional supplements (vitamins, enzymes, minerals, etc.); detoxifying the body (purging, fasting, coffee enemas, colonic irrigations, cleansing the kidneys, the lungs, and the skin, and exercising); maintaining an adequate diet; (see footnote 4) providing proper neurological stimulation (e.g., osteopathic manipulation, chiropractic adjustments, \"mandibular equilibration to reshape the skull,\" or physiotherapy); and taking a positive spiritual attitude (\"purifying the emotions and spirits\") (472). The Kelley nutritional program gained popularity in the 1970s, when Kelley gave many interviews and made unequivocal claims that his program was regularly able to cure a wide range of cancers: \"It is extremely effective and rather inexpensive. Those who are willing to faithfully and tediously follow it will be successful. Those who follow it in part or haphazardly will be completely unsuccessful\" (472). He also developed a mail-order approach to nutritional-metabolic treatment in which he was able to use \"technicians\" who assisted patients in getting on and following his program. Specific recommendations for patients were generated by his computer system. In addition, Kelley developed his own supply houses for the supplements, (see footnote 5) water filtration systems, and even the coffee (\"Kelley Koffee\"). An updated and expanded version of his treatment was published in 1983 by Fred Rohe with Kelley's input (761). Kelley endorsed Rohe's book, stating that it represented his most up-to-date findings and recommendations. In this second phase, Kelley's spiritual philosophy had taken on a strong \"New Age\" tone. He wrote: . . . there has to be some purpose to human life on this planet. That purpose seems to me to be the development of understanding and inner growth. I define inner growth as the expansion of our whole being, particularly our spirit, as we interact with each other and with the environment...This new positive foundation supports a new paradigm for the field of health care, allowing for the influx of great new streams of intelligence, experiences, and creativity. Millions of people who come along in future generations will be able to build and react upon this new paradigm. It is an ultra-holistic model with a completely realistic and scientific framework. We are moving from a left-brain dominant system to a left/right balanced brain system, with plenty of heart mixed in. I don't know if I understand it all \u2014I don't think anybody can completely grasp such a comprehensive process of change. But it's a beautiful thing to watch. (761) According to Rohe, Kelley had noticed that not everyone he treated responded the same way, and modified his original idea of \"one answer to cancer.\" He came to believe that there was no single, perfect diet for all patients. To account for each individual's unique metabolic makeup, Kelley devised a system of metabolic typing or classifying each individual and coordinating a unique set of recommendations for each. One of the elements of the Kelley program that evolved substantially from the first phase was his use of diagnostic tools. The \"Kelley Enzyme Test,\" one of the many tests used in the program, was designed to provide a very early diagnosis-one month to several years before clinical signs of cancer (761). The test consisted of taking ten \"Ultra- zyme\" tablets over a four-week period. The presence or absence of cancer was indicated by the person's observation of whether they felt better, worse, or no different during this period. Feeling either better or worse indicated the presence of cancer, whereas feeling no different meant that the person was probably free of cancer (but in this case Kelley recommended that the test be repeated with a double dose of the enzyme tablets to be sure.) The test was not intended to indicate the location of cancer in the body or the type of tumor (761). According to Rohe, Kelley believed that environmental pollutants were being incorporated into our bodies and becoming internal toxins, and that exhaustion of the fertility of the nation's farmlands was depleting our foods of nutritive value. All of this led, he reasoned, to pancreatic and immune system breakdowns, leading ultimately to cancer. The diet recommended by Kelley as stated in the Rohe book outlines the following guidelines: restrict intake of meat (except liver); consume no protein after lunchtime; no refined foods, pasteurized milk, peanuts, tea (except herbal), coffee (except in enemas), soft drinks, tobacco, liquor, white rice, or fluoridated water. He recommended that patients eat fresh, raw salads, vegetable juices, whole grain cereals, raw liver (liver must be taken raw to preserve the \"enzymes, amino acids, and other intrinsic factors science has not yet identified-which are destroyed when the liver is cooked\"), nuts and seeds, cultured milk products, eggs (preferably soft boiled or raw, except for certain types of cancers), beans, etc. In summary, the diet consisted of increasing one's consumption of raw foods, decreasing protein intake, and eliminating refined foods and additives. The only classification system used by Kelley at the time of the Rohe book was a breakdown between \"soft\" and \"hard\" tumors. \"Hard\" tumors included all except leukemia, lymphomas, melanomas, and multiple myeloma, which were classified as \"soft.\" The nutritional supplementation recommended by Kelley consisted of 25 supplements (enzymes, vitamins, glands, minerals, hydrogen peroxide, aloe vera, bile salts, freeze- dried liver, etc.) that were to be taken for a two-year period. In the standard protocols, patients were classified as \"hard tumor\" and \"soft tumor\" patients and were recommended the same list of supplements, although \"soft tumor\" patients were advised to take a few extra foods. Some patients were given specific recommendations tailored to them and in these, patients often were advised to take additional supplements beyond the 25 listed in the standard protocol. Patients were referred to Kelley's Nutritional Counseling Service in Texas for additional information. These supplements were intended to stimulate the release of \"wastes and debris\" from the body. Ridding the body of these wastes through detoxification was advised as essential to the program's success. Kelley recommended that patients take at least one strong coffee enema each day, to clean out the liver and gallbladder and to rid the body of toxins produced during tumor digestion (see also discussion in Box 3B). In addition to coffee enemas, Kelley recommended regular purging, fasting, and colonic irrigation (high enemas, between 18 and 30 inches into the body). He also advised cleansing the kidneys, nostrils, lungs, and skin (761). As in Kelley's original description, other components of the program as described by Rohe were neurological stimulation and spiritual growth. Kelley advised patients to \"reactivate nerve function through structural alignment\": osteopathic manipulation, chiropractic adjustments, cranial osteopathy, mandibular equilibration (to reshape the skull and take stresses from the brain), and reflexology. Kelley considered matters of the spirit an integral part of his program: \"Just as the body must be purged and cleansed, so must the emotions and mental attitudes be purified.\" He advised removing \"all false teachings, false doctrines, fruitless activities, fears, and misunderstandings. Your spirit and very being hunger for truth-the truth that can be found only in the proper understanding of the Word of God.\" (761) To support his program and make his teachings more widely known, Kelley created the International Health Institute in Dallas, consisting of a group of doctors, dentists, chiropractors, naturopaths, metabolic technicians (nutritional counselors certified by the institute), and attorneys. Under the umbrella of this institute, Kelley's Nutritional Counseling Service was developed, whereby patients attended workshops to find out about the Kelley program and then answer the 3,200-question Metabolic Evaluation Survey (which reportedly took about eight hours to complete). This questionnaire, analyzed entirely by computer, formed the basis for the Kelley nutritional prescription, a program designed according to each patient's individual nutritional needs. Questions were answered on computer cards and sent to Kelley's headquarters. Kelley claimed that the cards gave him a detailed picture of the patient's metabolic type and of the efficiency of 50 physiological functions. In response to the questionnaire, patients received a lengthy, detailed computer printout of their metabolic status along with step-by-step instructions for following their particular version of the Kelley regimen-covering foods, supplements (in the range of 100- 200 pills per day), detoxification techniques, psychological approaches, and lifestyle changes (341). With the cooperation of physicians unaffiliated with Kelley's institute, cancer patients were advised by Kelley to submit the questionnaire every 6 months until, according to Kelley, their nutrient levels reach normal ranges, and after that, about once a year. For most early localized cancer, Kelley advised frequent oral doses of pancreatic enzymes taken between meals; the enzymes were said to destroy cancerous and other defective cells (353). Kelley maintained that patients with metastatic disease require prolonged therapy (1 to 2 years at least). In patients with very advanced malignancies involving many organs, Kelley did not claim that the tumors could necessarily be eliminated, only that the enzymes often shrink much of the tumor mass and could prevent the cancer from spreading further (353). Kelley designed a mail-order form for an intensive nutritional-metabolic program for cancer that reached many patients who may not have had access to other unconventional treatments. The idea that cancer could occur as a result of inappropriate nutrition and could be treated with intensive nutritional supplementation and detoxification, as articulated in his book One Answer to Cancer, brought Kelley a great deal of attention from the public, the medical profession, and state medical examiners. In 1971, Kelley was issued a restraining order forbidding him from treating non-dental disease and was prohibited from distributing copies of his book. Gonzalez reported that following this restraining order, Kelley became more cautious in his claims and practice; he required all patients to sign a form acknowledging that he was a dentist, not a medical doctor and that his nutritional programs were intended for nutritional support, not as therapies for any disease (353). Kelley's International Health Institute and his Computer Health Service (934) were closed in the mid-1980s. A computerized metabolic typing service similar to Kelley's is offered by Healthexcel in Winthop, Washington, although Kelley is not identified as being directly involved in the service (390). Current Applications of the Kelley Regimen In recent years, Nicholas Gonzalez, MD, has examined the Kelley regimen and has provided an additional analysis of Kelley's individual metabolic profiles. Since Kelley's ideas and results are known only from his 1969 book and the 1983 book by Rohe, it is not known whether Gonzalez's descriptions match Kelley's most recent interpretations of his program. However, Gonzalez is practicing this regimen in New York (354) and Kelley is apparently not, so Kelley's metabolic typology as interpreted by Gonzalez is presented here in summary (353). According to Gonzalez, Kelley believed that human beings can be divided into three genetically based categories- \"sympathetic dominants,\" \"Sympathetic dominants\" will have highly efficient and developed sympathetic nervous systems. \"In addition, the tissues, organs and glands normally stimulated by the sympathetic nerves- the heart for example-will be well developed. However, in this group the parasympathetic nervous system will be relatively inefficient, and all the tissues and organs normally activated by this system will be physiologically sluggish.\" In \"parasympathetic dominants,\" the opposite is the case, and in \"balanced types,\" both branches of the nervous systems and corresponding tissues, organs, and glands are equally developed. Sympathetic dominants are hypothesized to have evolved in tropical and subtropical ecosystems on plant-based diets. Parasympathetic dominants evolved in colder regions on meat- based diets. The balanced types evolved in intermediate regions on mixed diets. While modern migrations have extensively mixed the three types, Kelley believes people tend to belong definitively to one of the three categories. Kelley thus evolved a diet for each type based on its hypothesized historical origins. And he traced a characteristic path of \"metabolic decline\" for each group when they consume the wrong diet. He associates \"hard tumors\" with severely compromised sympathetic dominants, and \"soft tumors\"- cancers of the white blood cells and lymph system- with severely compromised parasympathetic dominants. Gonzalez dispenses with the neurological stimulation and spiritual components of the original Kelley regimen, and now divides the Kelley therapy into several components. Gonzalez's regimen consists of: - an individualized diet, \"as determined by an experimental blood test,\" that ranges in content from entirely vegetarian to entirely meat, with about 90 variations in between. Gonzalez stated in a recent interview that he has \"patients who will not get well unless they eat fatty red meat three or four times a day\" (356). - large doses of nutritional supplements, as many as 150 pills a day (356), including vitamins, digestive enzymes (e.g., pancreatic enzymes, pepsin, hydrochloric acid, bile), and concentrates in pill-form of beef organs and glands. - coffee enemas. Attempts at Evaluating the Kelley Regimen In his 1987 manuscript One Man Alone: An Investigation of Nutrition, Cancer, and William Donald Kelley (353), Gonzalez presents case histories of 50 patients he selected from Kelley's files. This case series has been singled out by proponents as one of the most convincing in support of an unconventional treatment (530,596). As a means of finding out whether the evidence presented in these cases would be convincing to the medical community, OTA asked six physicians who are members of the Advisory Panel for this OTA study to each review a portion of Gonzalez's case histories. Three of the physicians were supportive of some unconventional treatments (though none was associated particularly with Kelley or Gonzalez), and three were mainstream oncologists. (For convenience, these physicians are referred to, in this section, as \"unconventional\" and \"mainstream.\") The three unconventional practitioners are not oncologists, though each treats some cancer patients. Each of the 50 cases was assigned to one \"unconventional\" and one \"mainstream\" physician for review. Assignments were made randomly within each group of three physicians, so all possible pairings of reviewers could occur. The reviewers were asked to assume that Gonzalez's reports were accurate, and then comment on whether the course of the disease described for each patient was beyond reasonable expectation, and whether attribution of benefit to the Kelley program appeared justified. The cases include a variety of cancers: seven lymphome (various types); six three each of colon, lung, ovary, rectosigmoid, and testicular; and one each of bile duct, brain, cervix, metastatic liver (primary unknown), myeloma, kidney, stomach, and uterine. Each case history consists of a narrative by Gonzalez and copies of some supporting medical records. The criteria for including cases were: they had to have been evaluated by \"competent specialists\" so that the diagnosis would not be in doubt; patients should have been given a prognosis of \"poor\" or \"terminal;\" and there had to be evidence of regression of disease or \"long-term survival that might logically be attributed to the Kelley program.\" The patients were chosen from more than 1,000 selected patient records that Gonzalez determined were \"potentially suitable.\" He contacted 455 of them, and 160 seemed to satisfy the stated criteria. For each of these, Gonzalez reports that he \"obtained complete medical records,\" and the 50 cases were then selected. Gonzalez refers to these cases as \"representative\" of Kelley's patients, rather than his \"most 'impressive' cases.\" In addition to making general comments (discussed below), five of the six reviewers responded with a narrative on each case; one categorized cases as \"seem legitimate,\" \"somewhat suggestive,\" and \"definitely not convincing.\" In all cases, however, documentation presented in the manuscript was inadequate to confirm critical details of the narrative, and in many cases, it appeared that critical pieces of information did not exist in the medical record at all (e.g., confirmation of metastatic disease), mainly because the patients had not been followed up with tests and scans to determine the status of their disease. Fifteen cases were judged by the unconventional reviewer as definitely showing a positive effect of the Kelley program; the mainstream reviewer of each case found 13 of these unconvincing and 2 unusual. Nine cases were judged unusual or suggestive by the unconventional reviewer; the mainstream reviewer found these cases unconvincing. Fourteen cases were judged by the unconventional reviewer as having been helped by a combination of mainstream plus Kelley treatment; the mainstream reviewer found 12 of these cases unconvincing and 2 unusual. Twelve cases were considered unconvincing to both the unconventional and mainstream reviewers. Specific criticisms of the case presentations included the lack of histologic diagnosis in several cases, the assumption that disease was metastatic without biopsy, discrepancies between the narrative and the medical records (e.g., in one case, the surgical pathology report states that the tumor arose \"in the colonic mucosa infiltrating into the wall,\" Gonzalez describes the tumor as \"growing through the wall,\" which would have a much poorer prognosis), discounting the effects of prior mainstream treatment (e.g., hormonal treatment, which, unlike cytotoxic chemotherapy, may take months to take full effect), and the general lack of reassessment of patients' conditions once begun on the Kelley treatment. Three illustrative cases are discussed below. Discussion of Three Cases In one case history, a woman in her early 40s was diagnosed with a seven-centimeter \"infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the colon, intermediate differentiation with full thickness involvement of bowel wall but no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.\" It was removed surgically. She did well, except for chronic fatigue, until about a year and a half later, at which time she had a car accident and then developed severe abdominal pain with significant weight loss. Outpatient studies \"revealed a large, restricting tumor in the remnant of her descending colon.\" The narrative reports that the patient said her doctor told her that the cancer \"had metastasized widely.\" She refused recommended surgery. Shortly, she began the Kelley program, at a time when she appeared to be \"critically ill.\" Within a week, her bowel obstruction cleared and she improved gradually. \"Eleven months after beginning her protocol, she reports passing a large globular mass of tissue which she and Dr. Kelley assume was the remnants of her tumor.\" Seventeen years after diagnosis, she is alive and in \"excellent health and apparently cured of her cancer.\" The medical records accompanying this narrative include the discharge summary from the original surgery and corresponding radiology, surgery, and pathology report. The mainstream physician who reviewed this case judged that this patient's localized tumor was probably cured by the initial surgery. No documentation of the reported recurrence is supplied, and the cause of her later medical problems could not be determined. He commented that the globular mass of tissue, which was apparently seen only by the patient, was a unique but uninterpretable feature of this case. The unconventional physician who reviewed this case noted that the recurrence was not confirmed by pathology, but felt that the Kelley program probably was instrumental in her survival. In a second case, a man in his late 30s had an early stage (Clark's level II) malignant melanoma removed from his back. A \"liver mass\" was described in the hospital record as a \"space occupying lesion inferior portion right lobe of liver,\" but was not thought to represent metastatic disease. About three months later, he noticed a nodule under his left arm, which upon removal was found to be malignant. Sixteen lymph nodes were subsequently removed, of which five were positive for melanoma. Four months later, he had another nodule near the previous one, and had it removed; it also was positive for melanoma. No other treatment was recommended. According to the narrative, the patient developed fatigue and anorexia. After another six months, he noted another nodule on his forehead, and shortly thereafter began the Kelley program. He gained weight and the forehead nodule regressed, disappearing after six months. At his last followup two and a half years later, he had no evidence of cancer and was in \"excellent health.\" Supporting records for this case include the biopsy report from the first recurrence in the left axilla, a letter that appears to be from the treating oncologist to the patient's personal physician written about six months after the forehead nodule was noticed (letter on plain paper, no letterhead), and a letter written about six months later from the same oncologist to what appears to be the patient's insurance group discussing his history. The unconventional reviewer found this narrative \"highly suggestive\" of benefit from the Kelley program, but that the absence of continued followup weakened the case. The mainstream reviewer commented that a waxing and waning course for malignant melanoma is not unusual, and mentioned a patient of his own with a similar history, whom he has followed for 10 years. He also commented that the cause of the fatigue was unclear, but could have been related to depression. In addition, the letter to the patient's personal physician notes in relation to the forehead nodule that had disappeared, \"this was not thought to be metastatic melanoma when he was examined by my colleague...at that time.\" In a third case, a man in his mid-60s was diagnosed with well-differentiated infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the prostate during a routine physical. An abnormality of the right eighth rib was noted on a bone scan, which the narrative notes was \"initially believed consistent with metastatic disease.\" On x-ray, an infiltrate was noted in the lower region of the left lung, which the narrative states \"appeared to be an additional area of metastases.\" The patient refused further testing and treatment. During a hospitalization a little over a week later for removal of two superficial skin cancers, a chest x-ray showed some improvement in the lung infiltrate but the records stated that \"the possibility of an underlying neoplasm could not be excluded.\" He began the Kelley program shortly after that. Nine years later, the patient, when contacted, said that his prostate was found to be completely normal on a recent physical examination. The narrative concludes that this was a \"most remarkable patient,\" and that \"it seems reasonable to attribute...prolonged survival to the Kelley program.\" Supporting records for this case include the discharge summary and biopsy report from his original hospitalization. Neither the unconventional nor the mainstream reviewer found this a case inconsistent with the expected course. Both commented that there was no real evidence of metastatic disease. The mainstream reviewer added, \"The survival of nine years with localized adenocarcinoma is not at all unusual, and such cases are identified fairly frequently in patients who seek medical attention for obstructive symptoms related to their associated benign prostatic hyperplasia\" (271). General Comments The mainstream reviewers had similar general comments about the cases. A general theme in their remarks was that, based on the material presented, it was not possible to relate the reported results to the Kelley treatments. Nearly all had mainstream treatment, which, along with the natural variability of the disease, might also have been sufficient to account for the observed outcome. Two reviewer comments include: My impression of these cases overall is that most of them represent better than average survival from their respective diseases, and to persons who are not familiar with the breadth of individual disease survival spectra they might seem unusual. For the most part, however, they are not and they do not as a group represent any basis for further pursuit of the Kelley treatment per se (271). Those of us who have worked over the years with cancer patients have come to respect the vagaries of human biology wherein there are cancer patients who for unclear reasons fare better than we would have expected (544). In several instances, reviewers commented they had in their care patients whose courses are as exceptional, for reasons not immediately apparent, as the Kelley cases they reviewed. Another common criticism was that comparing an individual patient's survival with average group statistics is misleading and an invalid use of the group data. ...it is an elementary statistical principal that retroactive or retrospective reviews of groups of patients such as that surveyed by Dr. Gonzalez of necessity are fraught with the bias imposed by the ways in which the patients selected themselves for referral to the Kelley program....These patients can hardly be considered representative of the entire spectrum of cancer patients. Secondly, in critiquing the cases, Dr. Gonzalez is highly selective in marshalling references and supporting assertions which are limited and clearly chosen to support his point of view. His review of each case is not a neutral exercise, but is slanted to support his assertion that the Kelley program has had an impact on the outcomes of these patients (544). General comments of the unconventional reviewers were significantly different: As an overall assessment, I would judge that the patients under my review appear probably, but not certainly, to have presented for the most part an unusual course, that the outcome exceeded normal expectancies with current contemporary conventional management and that the effect of the Kelley treatment contributed significantly, although not necessarily exclusively, to the outcome (271). I have...found 5 which seem legitimate; 5 suggestive but not definitive, 2 somewhat suggestive; 8 definitely not convincing. If we can extrapolate to the 50 cases there might be 12 which seem on the basis of the info presented, to represent genuine unexpected \"cures\" or remissions. Certainly, even 25% is striking. It obviously does not rule out expectancy and great motivation as the \"cause\" of the remission. ...in the cases I have marked legitimate, based upon the facts presented and beyond any reasonable medical doubt, it appears that totally unexpected remissions occurred. If there is such a thing as \"best cases,\" these appear to fulfill that definition. It would be unscientific to ignore such data (795). Another comment had to do with the difficulty of assessing best cases attributable strictly to unconventional treatment, because patients so often use both mainstream and unconventional treatment (218). The OTA review of Gonzalez's case histories indicates that physicians generally supportive of unconventional treatments find some of the cases supportive of benefit from the Kelley regimen, whereas mainstream physicians do not find such suggestion of benefit, for several reasons. Key reasons appear to be lack of adequate documentation of the course of disease and reliance in most cases on unusually long survival rather than documented tumor remission. (See chapter 12 for a discussion of \"best case\" series, including discussion of medical documentation and endpoints.) Macrobiotic Diets Macrobiotic diets, consisting largely of cooked vegetables and whole grains, are among the most popular unconventional approaches used by cancer patients (177,530,781). Books and magazines, special food items, macrobiotic cooking classes, and other macrobiotic products and services have, for the past decade or more, been easily accessible through local health food stores and regional macrobiotic teaching centers (\"East-West Centers\"). General bookstores are now also a common source of information about macrobiotic beliefs and practices, often carrying at least a few of the many available books by macrobiotic teachers and by individuals who initiated a macrobiotic regimen following diagnosis of disease. One recent example is a widely publicized book (777) (and excerpted magazine articles (634,635,776)) recounting a physician's personal use of a macrobiotic diet as an adjuvant treatment for prostate cancer. During the past three or four decades in the United States, a small group of proponents has been active in developing and teaching macrobiotic beliefs and practices, drawing at first from elements of Japanese culture and Eastern philosophy. During this time, the dietary recommendations have been modified, and continue to evolve. One of the most prominent leaders in the macrobiotic movement is Michio Kushi, who, in 1978, founded the Kushi Institute near Boston, the aim of which is to \"provide the education necessary to achieve our common goal of a healthy and peaceful world\" (501). The overall goals of macrobiotic education include teaching people to take responsibility for their state of health and to develop natural, balanced ways of living seen as essential to recovery from disease. Kushi and his staff offer courses covering a diverse array of practical and theoretical issues, including physical and psychological health and wellbeing, environmental concerns, spiritual evolution, and international peace. Another prominent leader in the U.S. macrobiotic movement is Herman Aihara, president of the California-based George Ohsawa Macrobiotic Foundation, a group whose aim is to spread the teachings of macrobiotics and its practical application in daily life. The Foundation publishes writing pertaining to macrobiotic priniciples and diet, along with a monthly magazine, and teaches macrobiotic cooking methods (16). Macrobiotics is defined as the way of life according to the greatest or longest possible view (509). Kushi believes that through its practice, i.e., the \"selection, preparation, and manner of eating of our daily food, as well as the orientation of consciousness,\" it is possible to apply \"the order of the universe, nature, and life\" to our daily lives (507,509). According to Kushi, \"macrobiotics is neither a treatment nor a therapy, but rather a common sense approach to daily living\" (506) and a comprehensive approach to the maintenance of health (507). The central and most prominent element of the macrobiotic belief system is its dietary practice. Most of the recent popular literature, including much of Kushi's own writings, focuses on the use of macrobiotic diets not only to promote general health and wellbeing, but to relieve illnesses such as cancer (509) and AIDS (636). One effect of that literature is that many U.S. cancer patients initiate a macrobiotic regimen following a diagnosis of cancer and do so with the hope of obtaining direct health benefits related to their cancer; many who recover believe that their renewed health was a result of the macrobiotic diet they followed. While the macrobiotic diets were not developed primarily as a treatment for cancer, they are, nevertheless, promoted actively and followed by many as a treatment for cancer. Accordingly, this section of the report focuses on current macrobiotic practices as applied to cancer treatment. The adoption of a macrobiotic regimen in other primary contexts, e.g., as a general lifestyle choice, as a preventive measure against cancer, or as treatment for conditions other than cancer, is not covered in this report. Background and Philosophy The introduction of macrobiotic practices into the United States is usually attributed to George Ohsawa (1893-1966), the pen name for Yukikazu Sakurazawa, a Japanese teacher who studied the writings of Sagen Ishizuka (1850-1910), a Japanese physician. Ohsawa is said to have cured himself of serious illness by changing from the modern refined diet then sweeping Japan to a simple diet of brown rice, miso soup, sea vegetables, and other traditional foods (509). He initiated the development of macrobiotic philosophy, reportedly integrating elements of Eastern and Western with \"holistic\" perspectives on science and medicine (509). Ohsawa made his first of several visits to the United States in 1959. Through his writings and teachings, Ohsawa combined elements of Zen Buddhist philosophy with macrobiotic principles. He popularized his approach through advocacy of the \"Zen macrobiotic diet\"-the diet from which the current (and different) macrobiotic regimen was developed. Ohsawa advocated simplicity in diet as a key to good health. He believed that personal happiness and health could be achieved by following a predominantly vegetarian dietary plan consisting of unprocessed, organically grown grain products, especially cereal grains (which he referred to as \"principal food\"), vegetables, beans, fruit, and seafood. In his 1965 book, Zen Macrobiotics (693), Ohsawa outlined ten stages of diet (designated numbers -3 to +7), with diet -3 consisting of 10 percent cereals, 30 percent vegetables, 10 percent soups, 30 percent animal products, 15 percent salads and fruits, 5 percent desserts, and beverages \"as little as possible.\" With each higher number diet, Ohsawa reduced the percentages of food from some of these categories or eliminated the category entirely and increased others, so that, e.g., in diet +3, 60 percent was cereals, 30 percent was vegetables, and 10 percent was soups. Ohsawa regarded diet +7, which consisted of 100 percent cereals, as the \"highest\" way of eating for treating illness, including cancer, or as a short term exercise in dietary simplicity (592). A 1971 report of the AMA Council on Foods and Nutrition noted various types of serious nutritional deficiencies, some of which were fatal, among individuals restricting themselves to Ohsawa's +7 diet for extended periods of time. These included cases of scurvy, anemia, hypoproteinemia (low serum protein), hypocalcemia (low serum calcium), emaciation due to starvation, and loss of kidney function due to restricted fluid intake (43). Publicity surrounding these cases led to the development of a strongly negative stereotype of the macrobiotic regimen in the 1960s. The American Cancer Society (ACS) Committee on Unproven Methods of Cancer Management published its first statement on macrobiotic diets in 1972 (90). In the 1970s and 1980s, changes in the content and focus of the macrobiotic movement were led to a great extent by Michio Kushi, who had studied with Ohsawa, and who came to the United States from Japan in 1949 (499). Kushi, along with Herman Aihara and other leaders in the macrobiotic movement, preserved elements of Ohsawa's philosophy while incorporating a variety of broader and more complex components into macrobiotic philosophy and practice (16). Most notably, Ohsawa's 10-phase dietary levels were replaced with the general \"standard macrobiotic diet,\" which Kushi described in detail in his 1983 book, The Cancer Prevention Diet (509). Aihara recommended his own macrobiotic dietary guidelines for cancer patients in his books Basic Macrobiotics (16) and Acid and Alkaline (15). Those books, along with Anthony Sattilaro's 1982 book, Recalled by Life, highlighted a new aspect of macrobiotic practice, at least from a public perspective, by asserting a fundamental relationship between current macrobiotic diets and cancer remission. Rationale Kushi and his associates have become prominent spokespersons for the ideas underlying macrobiotic practices and for the rationale for applying them to the treatment of cancer. From Kushi's perspective, the development of cancer is determined by dietary, environmental, social, and personal factors; by extension, existing cancers may be influenced by these same factors. Kushi cites a number of specific factors he believes are linked fundamentally to the development of cancer, including patients' \"overall blood quality,\" consumption of excess nutrients, exposure to toxic substances, \"mentality and way of life,\" as well as more general factors, such as unfavorable trends in the food industry and our \"increasingly unnatural and sedentary way of life.\" He emphasizes the role of personal behavior in the development of cancer: \"cancer is not the result of some alien factor over which we have no control,\" he writes, but rather \"the product of our own daily behavior, including our thinking, lifestyle, and daily way of eating\" (509). The development of cancer is described as a longterm, multistep process that begins well in advance of actual tumor formation. Kushi writes: Cancer is only the terminal stage of a long process. Cancer is the body's healthy attempt to isolate toxins ingested and accumulated through years of eating the modern unnatural diet and living in an artificial environment (509). He believes that these accumulated toxins result from overconsumption of milk, cheese, meat, eggs, and other fatty, oily, or greasy foods (509), and of foods with a cooling or freezing effect, such as ice cream, soft drinks, or orange juice (509). Depending on their location in the body, these accumulated toxins are manifested initially as, e.g., allergies, earaches, coughing and chest congestion, a \"bulging abdomen,\" periodic swelling and weakness in the legs, dry skin, hardening of the breasts, prostate abnormalities, vaginal discharge, or ovarian cysts-problems Kushi believes are indications of potentially precancerous conditions (509). As he explains it: As long as improper nourishment is taken in, the body will continue to isolate abnormal excess and toxins in specific areas, resulting in the continual growth of cancer. When a particular location can no longer absorb toxic excess, the body must search for another place to localize it, and so the cancer spreads. This process continues until the cancer metastasizes throughout the body and the person eventually dies (509). In Kushi's view, the central error in our behavior that leads directly to an imbalanced and unnatural state in the body and thereby to cancer development, is the consumption of food that is overly expansive and contractive (509). He uses the traditional Oriental concepts of yin (expansive) and yang (contractive), described as antagonistic and complementary forces that create and balance all phenomena on earth (509), to devise a framework for explaining and formulating a set of dietary recommendations to treat each type of cancer. A macrobiotic approach to treating cancer would first classify each patient's illness (see footnote 7) as predominantly yin or yang, or sometimes as a combination of both, based in part on the location of the primary tumor in the body and the location of the tumor in the particular organ. In general, tumors in peripheral or upper parts of the body or in hollow, expanded organs are considered yin; examples include lymphoma, leukemia, Hodgkins disease, and tumors of the mouth (except tongue), esophagus, upper stomach, breast, skin, and outer regions of the brain. Tumors in lower or deeper parts of the body or in the more compact organs are considered yang, e.g., cancers of the colon, rectum, prostate, ovaries, bone, pancreas, and inner regions of the brain. Cancers thought to result from a combination of yin and yang forces include melanoma and cancers of the lung, bladder, kidney, lower stomach, uterus, spleen, liver, and tongue (509). Macrobiotic dietary treatment would attempt to correct the perceived excess of yin, yang, or both tendencies. For cancers classified as predominantly yang, Kushi recommends the standard macrobiotic diet (explained below) with a slight emphasis on yin foods, and for cancers classified as predominantly yin, the same diet with a slight emphasis on yang foods. Patients with cancers classified as resulting from both yin and yang forces are advised to follow \"a central way of eating,\" as suggested in the standard macrobiotic diet. Different cooking styles are also recommended based on this disease classification (509). Beyond dietary guidelines, a number of additional recommendations are emphasized in the macrobiotic regimen, e.g., obtaining regular exercise, avoiding electromagnetic radiation, synthetic fabrics, and chemical fumes, and maintaining a good mental attitude. Kushi writes: A person with cancer must understand that he or she was directly responsible for the development of the disease, through his or her daily diet, manner of thinking, and way of life. The patient should be encouraged to reflect deeply, to examine those aspects of modern mentality that have produced the problem of cancer and a host of other unhappy situations. These reflections should include a review of the rich heritage of traditional wisdom developed by many cultures over thousands of years, an appreciation of the endless wonders of the natural world, including the body's marvelous self-protective and recuperative mechanisms, and a respect for the order of the universe that produces these phenomena (509). The overall purpose of these various changes in diet, exercise, attitude, and family interactions is reportedly to bring every aspect of the patient's life into balance. Macrobiotic philosophy teaches patients to be grateful and assume responsibility for everything in their lives, including their illness. By doing this, patients are encouraged to believe that since they had the power to create their illness, they must also have the capability to recover from it (667). According to his 1983 book, Kushi does not encourage cancer patients to combine the macrobiotic diet with mainstream cancer treatment, except in immediately life-threatening circumstances, such as an inability to eat normally or an obstruction in the digestive system (509). Although he does encourage patients to keep their physicians informed of their macrobiotic practices and to have periodic medical checkups, he recommends in his book that patients gradually reduce their reliance on mainstream medicine as their health improves. He notes that patients who follow a macrobiotic diet while taking mainstream treatment might have a slower recovery than they would have with the macrobiotic approach alone. After an initial one to four months of both conventional and macrobiotic treatment, patients are advised to \"reduce the frequency of outside treatment\" (509). Kushi encourages patients to find physicians who are also trained in macrobiotic dietary practices and offers referrals to macrobiotic physicians through the Kushi Institute. According to information supplied to OTA by one of Kushi's associates, Kushi no longer recommends against cancer patients' combining the macrobiotic diet with mainstream treatment and encourages them to seek ongoing conventional care (652a). In practice, there could be wide variation in patients' interpretations of Kushi's dietary guidelines, although no systematic information is available to document how patients are using macrobiotic diets in cancer treatment. In addition to consulting the Kushi Institute in Boston, local East-West Foundations, or other national macrobiotics groups, a variety of approaches may be taken in following a macrobiotic regimen. For instance, patients may rely primarily on information obtained from books or magazines written by Kushi and others, with little or no guidance from physicians or macrobiotic counselors. They may receive instruction in cooking methods without more general guidance about the regimen. Patients may also be treated by physicians unaffiliated with the Kushi Institute who advocate an individualized version of the macrobiotic diet as an adjunctive approach to conventional treatment. Macrobiotic Dietary Guidelines The standard macrobiotic diet forms the basis for recommendations for individual patients and is adapted according to the individual's age, sex, level of activity, personal needs, and native climate. Kushi advises that such individual recommendations be made with the supervision of a qualified macrobiotics counselor and with a medical or nutritional professional, although patients may devise their own dietary plans or modify the initial ones devised by a macrobiotics counselor. Kushi's 1983 book, The Cancer Prevention Diet describes specific dietary recommendations for most major types of cancer. Kushi recommends a general dietary plan for cancer prevention and treatment in addition to guidelines for specific types of cancer. The standard macrobiotic diet emphasizes the intake of complex carbohydrates over simple sugars; high fiber foods over low fiber foods; unsaturated fats over saturated ones; sea salt over refined salt; natural vitamins and minerals found in food, rather than supplemental vitamins and minerals; natural, organically grown foods over chemically fertilized foods; whole, unrefined foods over processed foods, vegetable protein over animal protein, and foods cooked by gas and wood burning stoves rather than by microwave ovens or electric stoves (507). The standard macrobiotic diet is adjusted on a case by case basis, taking into account geographic, seasonal, and individual situations. The diet consists of the following types of food, identified as ones for regular or daily use, for occasional use, for infrequent use, and to avoid: - 50 to 60 percent by volume of daily food includes cooked, organically grown, whole cereal grains (e.g., brown rice, barley, millet, bulghur, oats, corn, rye, wheat, and buckwheat, with a small portion of whole wheat pasta, unyeasted whole grain breads, and other partially processed whole cereal grains) prepared in a variety of ways. - 5 to 10 percent soups (about 1 to 2 bowls per day), made with vegetables, seaweed, grains, or beans, seasoned with miso or tamari soy sauce. - 25 to 30 percent local, organically grown vegetables, which may include a small amount of raw vegetables and pickled vegetables. The diet specifies vegetables to be eaten frequently (e.g., green cabbage, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, collards, pumpkin, watercress, Chinese cabbage, squash, butternut squash, buttercup squash, burdock, and carrots, among others), ones \"for occasional use\" (e.g., celery, cucumber, iceberg lettuce, mushrooms, snow peas, and string beans), and ones to be avoided (e.g., potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, asparagus, spinach, beets, zucchini, and avocado). - 5 to 10 percent beans of various types (e.g., azuki beans, chickpeas, lentils), bean products (e.g., tofu, tempeh, and vegetables (e.g., wakame, hiziki, arame, Irish moss). - Occasional foods \"if needed or desired\" 1 to 3 times per week include a small amount of fresh whitemeat fish (e.g., flounder, haddock, herring, scrod, snapper, sole, cod, carp, halibut, or trout), locally and organically grown fruit, dried or cooked (individuals living in temperate climates are advised not to eat tropical or semitropical fruits); seeds and nuts, grain sweeteners, and vinegars. - Non-aromatic and non-stimulating teas, such as bancha twig tea, stem tea, roasted brown rice tea, or cereal grain coffee, or plain, non-iced water. - Foods generally avoided on a macrobiotic diet include: meat and semi-tropical soda; artificial drinks; aromatic or stimulating tea or coffee; all artificially colored, preserved, sprayed, or chemically treated foods; all refined and polished grains and flours; canned, frozen, and irradiated foods, hot spices; and alcohol (500,505). Kushi recommends that people with cancer, or with a \"serious precancerous condition\" emphasize certain types of food in the diet for an initial period \"until vitality is restored\" (509). In general, foods are identified as belonging on a scale from extremely yin (alcohol, tropical fruits, and dairy products) to the center (such as grains, beans, vegetables, and nuts), to extremely yang (fish, cheese, poultry, meat, and eggs). Patients with a tumor type categorized as predominantly yin would be advised to avoid, e.g., fruits, while occasional small amounts of white fish, a moderately yang food, would be encouraged. Patients with a yang cancer would be advised to avoid fish altogether, at least initially, but would be encouraged to eat small amounts of dried or cooked fruits, which are thought of as moderately yin foods. Foods categorized as extremely yin (such as sugar) or extremely yang (such as red meat) are considered inadvisable on a macrobiotic diet for patients with any type of cancer (509). Possible Adverse Effects The issue of possible adverse effects of the macrobiotic regimen has been a longstanding controversy in the medical and macrobiotic communities. Case reports of serious nutritional deficiencies and disorders resulting from extreme use of the Zen macrobiotic diet +7 and some types of vegetarian diets not specifically associated with macrobiotics have been published in the medical literature (267,760,797,799). The relevance of those case reports to currently recommended macrobiotic practices has been greatly reduced since the introduction of the general \"standard macrobiotic diet\" outlined above. Partly in response to the evidence of nutritional deficiencies, however, macrobiotic instructors reportedly adjusted some of the dietary recommendations (502,550). In current macrobiotic recommendations, for instance, small amounts of whitemeat fish and seafood are allowed a few times per week, although dairy products, eggs, poultry, and red meat are generally excluded (509). Vitamin and mineral supplements are not recommended in the macrobiotic regimen. Advocates point out that a wide range of possible combinations of particular grains, beans, vegetables, fish, and fruit exist in individual macrobiotic diets, and that the standard macrobiotic diet is lower in fat and cholesterol and higher in fiber, complex carbohydrates, vitamins A and C, and beta carotene than a typical U.S. diet (504). It is also acknowledged, however, that macrobiotic guidelines can be interpreted too narrowly, resulting in overly restrictive food choices (276), and, in some individuals, possible deficiencies of certain nutrients (550). (These possibilities are not unique to macrobiotic diets, and apply equally to other diets.) Although vegetarian diets similar to the macrobiotic diet have been acknowledged as potentially healthful and nutritionally adequate when appropriately planned (30,83), such diets are believed to carry a risk of nutritional deficiency under certain circumstances, notably in individuals with increased nutritional requirements (e.g., infants and children, pregnant and lactating women, and the seriously ill (95)) and in cases in which the diet is unplanned, unsupervised, or followed too restrictively (83,457). Critics of macrobiotics have suggested that seriously ill cancer patients, particularly those with cachexia, (see footnote 8) have special nutritional and caloric requirements that may not be met by a macrobiotic regimen and that may actually be exacerbated by it (30,53,95). Such effects have not been documented, however. One possible adverse effect of an overly restrictive macrobiotic diet is a deficiency of vitamin B12, an essential nutrient normally supplied by meat, poultry, and other animal sources. Kushi maintains that his recommendation that a small amount of certain types of fish be included in the diet greatly reduces or eliminates this risk. In the dietary recommendations for certain tumor types (e.g., those he believes are caused by an excess consumption of animal products), fish is excluded, however, at least for an initial period in some cases (509). Kushi believes that vitamin B12 is supplied by other components of the macrobiotic diet, e.g., by sea vegetables and certain fermented foods (504). While the vitamin may be present in some sea vegetables (nori, seaweed, etc.) and in some fermented soya products (tempeh, tamari, rice miso, tofu, etc.) used in the diet, there is doubt about its availability in these foods in a form that the body can use (515). Another possible adverse effect of a macrobiotic diet is a deficiency of vitamin D, which is essential for growth and development. Kushi acknowledges that an adequate supply of vitamin D might be a problem for some individuals, particularly young children, since most of the common sources of vitamin D-dairy products-are not included in the diet (924). A recent study of Dutch children fed with macrobiotic diets showed that growth curves for these children were below the Dutch standard after about 5 months of age and did not catch up later on in childhood (925). For children, Kushi advocates the addition of fish liver oils to the diet, other foods containing vitamins D and B12, and exposure to sunlight. For adolescents and adults, he recommends adequate exposure to sunlight without supplemental vitamin D unless deficiencies develop (924). It is not yet known whether these measures, if followed, are successful in averting vitamin D deficiencies in individuals eating macrobiotically. In its recent summary statement on macrobiotics, ACS noted that cancer patients following a macrobiotic regimen should take care to ensure adequate intakes of vitamins B12 and D, but that with proper planning, the diet could provide sufficient nutrition (30). Another summary article also expressed concern about vitamins B12 and D and about the adequacy of total calories and complete protein intake on the macrobiotic diet, and advised that cancer patients following Kushi's recommendations be medically supervised and monitored for potential nutritional deficiencies (95). Claims of Effectiveness In his book, The Cancer Prevention Diet, Kushi claims that macrobiotic diets have \"helped relieve\" patients with a variety of tumor types, but notes that the \"best responders\" have been cancers of the breast, cervix, colon, pancreas, liver, bone, and skin (509). He believes that cancers of the lung, ovaries, and testes have responded poorly to the macrobiotic approach (509). Clinical data in support of these claims are not provided. Kushi qualifies his claims of effectiveness by noting that certain conditions and personal attitudes must be present for a patient to recover while following a macrobiotic diet. These include: a spiritual awareness and an attitude of gratefulness for the illness and for the opportunity it affords to correct previous errors in diet and lifestyle; an informed and careful interpretation of the macrobiotic dietary guidelines and cooking methods; a will and determination to overcome one's illness; support of family and friends; and maintenance of one's \"natural healing ability\" (509). Attempts at Evaluating Macrobiotics in Cancer Treatment OTA reviewed the available information concerning the efficacy of macrobiotic diets in cancer treatment. This information consists of retrospective case reviews and anecdotal reports, some of which come from the popular literature, and two unpublished retrospective studies. A number of individual accounts of patients who attributed their recovery from cancer to their adherence to a macrobiotic diet have been written in recent years (73,107,483,508,686,777,782). Although these various accounts reflect the authors' beliefs that they were helped by following a macrobiotic diet, they are nevertheless inadequate to make an objective assessment of the efficacy of the diet in treating cancer. In an unpublished study supplied to OTA by its authors, Carter and his colleagues discuss what they describe as \"two retrospective studies,\" one of patients with primary pancreatic cancer, the other of patients with advanced prostate cancer (171). The stated purpose of the pancreatic cancer study was \"to determine whether pancreatic cancer patients who adopted the macrobiotic dietary approach survived longer than those who did not.\" Patients included in the pancreatic cancer study were those who had been counseled by a particular counselor about macrobiotics during the period January 1980 through June 1984, and who (or whose next-of-kin) reported having modified their diet for at least three months. Of 109 patients who had been counseled during the relevant period, 36 could be reached, and of those, 23 reported having modified their diets for at least three months. The mean survival (the average) and median survival (the point in time after diagnosis by which half the group had died) of these 23 patients was compared with the survival times of all patients diagnosed during that same period through the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. (see footnote 9) Statistical tests of significance were performed to determine whether the macrobiotic patients lived significantly longer. The authors report that the mean survival for the 23 macrobiotic patients was 17.3 months, and for the SEER population, 6 months. Median survival was 13 months for the macrobiotic patients and 3 months for the SEER patients. They concluded from this comparison that the macrobiotic patients lived significantly longer. Unfortunately, serious flaws in Carter's analysis make that conclusion unsupportable and misleading. A comparison such as Carter makes between the length of survival of a selected group of patients and the length of survival among a national sample of patients would not indicate whether the selected group of patients lived longer than they would have, had they not followed a macrobiotic diet. The analysis overlooks the fact that treatment with a macrobiotic diet was only one of numerous known and unknown differences between the groups that could have affected survival time. It is impossible to determine by their method whether it was, in fact, the diet, or whether other treatments or the patients' characteristics or a number of other possible factors contributed to their survival with pancreatic cancer. For this reason, comparisons between the survival times are uninformative in suggesting a possible treatment effect in the selected group of patients. In addition, the way in which survival times are determined in Carter's study skews the results in favor of an effect of macrobiotics. According to the eligibility requirements, patients following a macrobiotic regimen had to survive for at least three months to be included in the study in the first place. The SEER patients, with whom the macrobiotic patients were compared, included patients from the time they were diagnosed. For pancreatic cancer patients, this is an important difference, since the SEER statistics showed that 50 percent of this national population had died by three months after diagnosis. In the second study described in Carter's paper, eleven patients with prostate cancer who followed a macrobiotic regimen along with conventional treatment were examined. No information is given about the way in which they were selected for inclusion in the study. The paper states that \"length of survival free-of-progression, overall median survival rates, and other characteristics of stage D2 prostate cancer patients, receiving conventional therapy and on a macrobiotic diet\" were compared with stage D2 prostate cancer patients reported in the literature, and with \"matched controls receiving conventional therapy and following a standard American diet.\" No other information is provided about these controls. The only comparison reported in the paper states that \"the median survival of the macrobiotic group was 81 months, whereas those using the standard American diet had a median survival of 45 months.\" It impossible, to interpret the results of the study, since details of the patients' selection factors are not reported in the manuscript. In general, however, conclusions in Carter's second study about survival time among prostate cancer patients following macrobiotic diets are subject to the same critical limitations as those in the study of pancreatic cancer patients described above. A randomized study, which could control for differences among study and control populations, would be needed in the future to generate valid evidence on possible effects of macrobiotic diets on cancer patients' survival. Certain types of non-randomized studies could also be used to detect possible antitumor effects of the diets (see ch. 12 for a discussion of such studies). In another unpublished manuscript (668), Newbold presents six case histories of patients with advanced cancer who adopted a macrobiotic diet in addition to using mainstream treatment. These cases are well described medically, including reference to appropriate diagnostic tests (all but one case was definitely biopsy-proven) and follow-up scans and tests. At OTA's request, several physicians on the project Advisory Panel reviewed and commented on Newbold's cases. As was the case with the review of Kelley cases, discussed earlier in this chapter, the reviews split along mainstream/ unconventional lines. The three mainstream reviewers did not find these cases compelling, however they did not find them lacking in technical detail, as they did the Kelley cases. One reviewer suggested the need for a randomized trial of the diet before any conclusions could be drawn. He also commented that \"restoration of harmony and balance to the lives of people with terminal illnesses and those without terminal illnesses is a reasonable goal,\" but he did not necessarily think that a diet could achieve this. The reasons given for skepticism about the cases were that the effects of mainstream treatment could not be ruled out as explanations for the observed effects; in one case, that there had been no scan to verify continued presence of disease before the patient adopted the macrobiotic diet; and in another case (an astrocytoma), the mainstream reviewers believed that the scans on which the reported regression rested could not have provided definitive evidence. The two unconventional physicians were more positive about these cases. One concluded that five of the six cases (all except the one without biopsy-proven diagnosis) showed positive effects of the macrobiotic diet. The other physician found two cases that seemed \"legitimate,\" two \"highly suggestive,\" one \"suggestive,\" and one not convincing (a different one from the other physician). If cases such as Newbold's were presented in the medical literature, it might help stimulate interest among clinical investigators in conducting controlled, prospective trials of macrobiotic regimens, which could provide valid data on effectiveness. It has also been suggested that improvements in recordkeeping and followup-e.g., monitoring compliance with dietary recommendations and health status among patients-could facilitate the funding and conduct of randomized clinical trials needed to study the efficacy of macrobiotic diets in cancer treatment (503). Footnotes 1. This section is based, in part, on a paper written by Keith I. Block and Charlotte Gyllenhaal, \"Nutrition: an essential tool in cancer therapy (84).\" 2. In the unconventional cancer treatment literature, \"metabolic\" treatment generally refers to treatments intended to stimulate patients' immunologic and biochemical processes to fight cancer. The term is used nonspecifically to refer to both particular treatments and to collections of unconventional treatments (such as combination pharmacologic and nutritional treatments). 3. Gerson published many articles in German before 1945 (see bibliography cited above). 4. This refers to a low protein diet and proper protein timing. Kelley claimed that \"if people would not eat protein after 1:00 p.m., 83% of cancer in the United States could be eliminated\" (472); no pasteurized milk, no peanuts, nothing cooked or processed, no white flour or white sugar; lots of vegetable and fruit juices, plenty of raw almonds, fresh raw salads, whole grain cereals. 5. Kelley believed that the supplements commercially available in health food stores and drug stores did not meet his standards of purity and potency, so he initiated a custom-made line of products made according to his specifications (353). 6. The autonomic nervous system, made up of the opposing sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, innervates smooth and cardiac muscle and glandular tissues, governing actions that are more or less automatic, such as actions of the heart, secretion, constriction of blood vessels, and peristalsis. The parasympathetic nervous system tends to induce secretion, increase the tone and contractility of smooth muscle, and cause blood vessels to dilate. Effects of the sympathetic nervous system are opposite. 7. Kushi uses the traditional Oriental practice of \"physiognomy\" to diagnose cancer and to monitor its progress in individual patients. Correlations are made between external appearances (such as facial features, posture, and skin color) and disorders of specific organ systems, and particular attention is paid to certain markings in the eyes and to skin color, since a greenish skin color on certain areas of the body is claimed to indicate the existance of a tumor (509,776). 8. Cancer cachexia refers to general physical wasting and malnutrition often associated with advanced cancer. 9. The SEER program covers about 10 percent of the U.S. population in various cities and States, and attempts to gather reports of all new cases of cancer diagnosed in those areas. BOX 3-A.-An Example of an Adjunctive Nutritional Approach to Cancer Treatment A program developed over the past ten years by Keith I. Block, MD, illustrates one approach to nutritional treatment that can be used in conjunction with mainstream cancer care. The program, as described by its developer, is intended to be used adjunctively and not as a substitute for medical treatment. At present, it is used in Block's private medical practice in Evanston, Illinois, and at an independent medical center in Chicago. According to Block's protocol, individualized dietary guidelines and nutritional treatment are used in combination with mainstream cancer treatment, exercise, and psycho- social support strategies for stress reduction. Overall dietary guidelines are made on the basis of nutritional assessments, including the use of body composition analysis, blood and laboratory studies, determinations of nitrogen balance, and other biochemical and clinical evaluations. Patients are given a range of food choices within an overall framework that covers five food groups (cereal grains, vegetables, fruits, fats, and proteins). Foods are divided into exchange lists so patients can select foods according to their tastes while still satisfying the overall nutritional requirements of the program. The semivegetarian diet Block recommends consists of high- fiber, low-fat, protein-restricted foods along with specific items such as soybean products, shiitake mushrooms, and sea vegetables. In general, Block recommends that 50 to 60 percent of calories be derived from complex carbohydrates, 12 to 25 percent of calories from fat, and the remainder from protein sources. The diet, which is modified on an individual basis, emphasizes foods high in vitamins, trace minerals, and substances thought to reduce cancer risks. Developed in part from macrobiotic principles, the diet has been modified to incorporate information from other sources, primarily experimental data from the scientific literature on substances that may be active in inhibiting tumor growth or stimulating immune responses. Nutritional analysis has reportedly shown Block's nutritional program to be nutritionally adequate; the Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) were met or exceeded for almost all nutritents for which RDAs have been established and for which nutrient analyses are available, and the diet reportedly exceeds requirements for vitamins A, C, and B12, calcium, iron, magnesium, and several other elements. Block's use of an adjunctive dietary program for cancer patients has several goals, some of which he believes have been met in many cases, based on observations of patients treated with this regimen. One goal is to maintain adequate nutritional support through oral feeding as much as possible, in order to improve patients' quality of life and help them retain \"a sense of self-empowerment and clinical autonomy.\" He notes that few of the cancer patients on his program experience weight loss, except those with anorexia in late stages of disease, or experience hair loss during chemotherapy. Another goal is to enhance patients' resistance to the disease by focusing on improving immune function and inhibiting tumor growth through the provision of a low-fat diet, which may decrease the intake of tumor- promoting substances. The high intake of vitamin A- containing vegetables in the diet is believed to enhance patients' responses to conventional cancer treatment. Overall, Block believes his program to be of benefit in diminshing the side effects of conventional treatment and in improving patients' quality of life. The treatment protocol has been described in some detail in unpublished manuscripts (83,84), but thus far, it has not been studied systematically so that its effects on patients can be judged adequately. BOX 3-B.-Coffee Enemas Several of the current unconventional cancer treatments, e.g., the Gerson treatment and the Kelley regimen, include a recommendation that patients take coffee enemas several times a day. Proponents believe that coffee enemas stimulate the secretion of bile and the action of the liver, helping to \"detoxify\" the body of waste products and poisons accumulated in the gastrointestinal tract (337,472). \"Colonic irrigation\" and \"high colonics\" are terms referring to a related procedure that involves flushing a larger portion of the colon with water. Colonic irrigation is used in the context of physical cleansing and general detoxification in many unconventional settings (450,959), but is usually distinct from the use of enemas in cancer treatment. A few studies examining the theory of self-poisoning through the accumulation of toxins and waste products in the body were published in the 1920s (21,259) as a result of a belief common at the turn of the century that impacted feces in the colon produced pathogenic toxins. The specific causative toxins have apparently never been identified or measured and possible physiologic effects of the \"detoxifying\" enemas have not been studied systematically. In general, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that coffee enemas detoxify the blood or liver. It has been suggested, however, that coffee taken by this route is a strong stimulant and can be at least as addictive as coffee taken regularly by mouth (947). The occasional use of enemas, usually consisting of plain water, is conventional practice for a number of medical purposes, e.g., to prepare for x-rays of the intestines, surgery, or childbirth (649), or to relieve constipation (613c). The enema procedure is reportedly not without certain risks, however (970). Case reports of serious adverse effects associated with enemas used in conventional and unconventional treatment have appeared in the medical literature. Coffee enemas, as discussed earlier, have been associated with fatal electrolyte imbalances. Transmission of enteric pathogens (835), fatal bowel perforation and necrosis (196,454), and toxic colitis (478,727,793) have been associated with various other types of enema (soapsuds, water, barium, herbal, etc.). Colonic irrigation has been linked with fatal amebiasis resulting from contaminated equipment (450). Proponents often point to the recommendation of coffee enemas in relatively recent editions of the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, a general health care guide, as evidence of the medical appropriateness and conventionality of coffee enemas (355). Up to and including its 1972 edition, the Merck Manual did recommend coffee as one type of ingredient for occasional use as a retention enema, the purpose of which was to \"soothe or lubricate rectal mucosa, to apply absorbable or local medications, or to soften feces\" (613). No mention was made of the use of coffee enemas to remove toxins from the body. In addition to coffee, other agents mentioned for the same purposes were starch, olive oil, cottonseed oil, mineral oil, and whiskey in isotonic saline. Retention enemas using coffee or any of these other substances were not being recommended for frequent use, however (76), and coffee enemas were not recommended for use as a part of treatment for cancer or any other serious illness-only for temporary, specific problems such as constipation. In the 1977 and later editions of the Merck Manual, the mention of coffee enemas was dropped. In the three most recent editions, enemas using olive oil, mineral oil, or isotonic saline are recommended for Contents](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/OTA/ota00.html) ||| [OTA Report Index](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/OTA/ota16.html) This [Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-four-hundred-thirty-six) [OTA Report: Pharmacologic and Biologic Treatments](https://quackwatch.org/related/ota/ota05/) A large and diverse group of unconventional cancer treatments has as its central component a pharmacologic or biologic substance, including biochemical agents, vaccines, blood products, and synthetic chemicals. Some of these pharmacologic and biologic treatments are offered at single sites under the direction of a developer or other chief proponent. Others are more widely available, are not necessarily associated with particular proponents, and may be used in combination with a variety of other unconventional and conventional treatments. Examples of unconventional pharmacologic or biologic cancer treatments associated with a single practitioner include: \"Antineoplastons\" offered by Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D., Ph.D., at his clinic in Houston; an autogenous vaccine developed by the late Virginia Livingston, M.D., at her clinic in San Diego; \"eumetabolic\" treatment offered by Hans Nieper, ...

Each of these treatments is discussed in detail below. Another pharmacologic treatment, \"Immuno-Augmentative Therapy\" offered by Lawrence Burton, Ph.D., at his clinics in the Grand Bahamas, West Germany, and Mexico, is discussed in chapter 6. Examples of pharmacologic approaches offered at a number of places, either singly or in combination, include laetrile, megavitamins, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), cell treatment, digestive enzymes, hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and a variety of other agents. When used in various combinations and with special diets, enemas, and instructions about avoiding substances thought to be harmful, these treatments become part of a general approach often referred to as \"metabolic therapy,\" a non-specific term used by many unconventional practitioners to refer to a combination of unconventional approaches aimed at improving the physical and mental condition of cancer patients (96). Many of the best known \"metabolic clinics\" are located in or near Tijuana, Mexico, not far from the US border, e.g., Centro Medico del Mar, American Biologics, the Manner clinic, St. Judes International, and Hospital Santa Monica. Practitioners associated with these clinics include Ernesto Contreras, Robert Bradford, Jimmy Keller, and [Kurt Donsbach](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/donsbach.html). Some of the major components of the \"metabolic\" treatments (vitamin C, laetrile, DMSO, cellular treatment, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone) are also discussed in this chapter. The treatments are presented in alphabetical order according to the name of the main practitioner or the substance used. Stanislaw Burzynski and Antineoplastons In the late 1960s, Stanislaw R. Burzynski, MD, proposed that a naturally occurring and continuously functioning biochemical system in the body, distinct from the immune system, could \"correct\" cancer cells by means of \"special chemicals that reprogram misdirected cells.\" He called these chemicals \"Antineoplastons,\" and defined them as naturally occurring peptides and amino acid derivatives that inhibit the growth of malignant cells while leaving normal cells unaffected (124,133). Peptides are a broad category of molecules, including many biologically active proteins, that are made up of combinations of amino acids. Burzynski developed a treatment regimen for cancer based on the administration of various types of Antineoplastons, which he originally isolated from urine and subsequently synthesized in the laboratory. He currently treats patients with Antineoplastons at his clinic and research facility in Texas. Burzynski received his MD in 1967 and his PhD in biochemistry the following year, both from the Medical Academy of Lublin in Poland. He moved to the United States in 1970, and obtained a license to practice medicine in Texas in 1973. From 1970 until 1977, he held the positions of research associate and assistant professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. In 1977, he left Baylor to establish his own research institute. He is now president of the Burzynski Research Institute in Stafford, Texas, where he and his colleagues conduct in vitro and animal research on Antineoplastons. Burzynski's clinical practice focuses on treatment of cancer patients with Antineoplastons, which he administers at his outpatient clinic in Houston. His current regimen for cancer patients includes oral and intravenous use of approximately 10 types of Antineoplastons, all of which are manufactured at the Burzynski Research Institute. From 1974 to 1976, Burzynski received funding from NCI for research involving gel filtration techniques to isolate peptides from urine and for testing their ability to inhibit in vitro growth of several types of cultured human cells (142). In 1976, Burzynski applied unsuccessfully for renewal of this grant, although he did receive supplemental funding until July 1977 (245). In 1983, he applied to FDA for an Investigational New Drug exemption (IND), which would allow him to use Antineoplastons in human studies designed to determine the efficacy and safety of Antineoplastons. That application was put on \"clinical hold,\" the action taken by FDA in cases where data submitted are insufficient to justify the investigational use of a substance in cancer patients. In March, 1989 the clinical hold was removed for one study, allowing a study of the oral form of Antineoplaston A10 in a small number of women with advanced, refractory, breast cancer (125). That study, which was planned to be conducted at a U.S. medical center, was later \"delayed,\" according to a public notice from Burzynski's staff, \"due to the high cost\" of conducting clinical trials in the United States (858). To date, no form of Antineoplaston has yet received FDA approval for use on patients outside of that specific study. Burzynski first isolated Antineoplastons from blood and then the urine of individuals without cancer. Burzynski developed the laboratory methodology to make at least one type of Antineoplaston (A10) synthetically. He reportedly obtained dozens of fractions (128), each containing many different Antineoplastons (133). Burzynski and other researchers reported testing each fraction for anticancer activity in cultured human cells and then for toxicity in animals. His first fraction, Antineoplaston A, which he used to treat 21 cancer patients at a hospital in Houston (143), was later subdivided into fractions A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 (132,133). Fraction A2 was reported an \"active\" ingredient which was named Antineoplaston A10; Burzynski identified the chemical structure of A10 as 3- phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedione (131). In addition to using it to treat patients, Burzynski supplies this product to the Sigma Chemical Company, which offers it for sale through its catalogue for research purposes. Two degradation products of Antineoplaston A10, identified as Antineoplastons AS2-1 and AS2-5 (130), have also been administered to cancer patients (see discussion below). Burzynski believes that a variety of Antineoplastons are present naturally in the tissue and body fluids of healthy people, but that, possibly as a consequence of cachexia (a metabolic process that results in physical wasting), cancer patients excrete excessive amounts in the urine, leaving them with low circulating levels. He states that treatment with Antineoplastons reduces the amount of endogenous Antineoplastons excreted, and that excretion of Antineoplastons decreases with tumor regression (133). Burzynski hypothesizes that Antineoplastons may act by interfering with the action of certain enzymes complexes (methylation complex isozymes) that allow malignant cells to gain a growth advantage over normal cells (546). He has also suggested that Antineoplastons may interact directly with DNA (524). Burzynski believes that Antineoplastons represent a \"completely new class of compounds\" (516). It is unclear whether or how Burzynski's Antineoplastons relate to a variety of known growth factors and inhibitors that are the focus of considerable mainstream research in biochemistry and oncology. Burzynski's theory of a biochemical antitumor surveillance system in the body mediated by endogenous Antineoplastons has not been recognized in the broader U.S. scientific community. However, some scientists have recently begun using Antineoplastons supplied by Burzynski to examine its biochemical and physiologic properties, particularly antitumor activity, in cultured tumor cells and in animal tumor models (see discussion below). Burzynski's Treatment Regimen At present, oral and intravenous forms of ten types of Antineoplaston are made by the Burzynski Research Institute; most patients reportedly take the oral form (124). Treatment starts with small doses and increases gradually until Burzynski determines that an optimal level has been reached. In some cases, Burzynski also prescribes low-dose chemotherapy (124) and a variety of common prescription drugs (134,136,138). Burzynski claims that following initial treatment with Antineoplastons, some patients produce sufficient quantities of endogenous Antineoplastons and no longer need treatment, while others continue taking oral doses of Antineoplastons to \"guard against future recurrence of cancer\" (124). The patient brochure from the Burzynski Research Institute states that the treatment is \"non-toxic\" (124), but that a \"small percentage of patients had some adverse reaction sometime during the course of treatment.\" Side effects cited include \"excessive gas in the stomach, slight skin rash, slightly increased blood pressure, chills and fever\" (124). There are no reports of adverse effects from Burzynski's treatment in the published literature. One unpublished report based on a site visit to the Burzynski Research Institute noted two patients who developed sepsis after treatment, one of whom died, although it did not include information confirming the association between the patients' death and Burzynski's treatment. The authors of that report noted that one possible route of infection is through intravenous injections into an indwelling subclavian catheter; infections of the indwelling lines would be likely if aseptic technique is not followed; this is more likely if the patient is not thoroughly instructed in the techniques of aseptic injection (79). Walde, who visited Burzynski's facilities in 1982, also noted this risk of catheter sepsis and air emboli resulting from patients administering their own intravenous doses through indwelling subclavian catheters, but concluded that \"the number of complications that [Burzynski and his associates] have been aware of, or have been notified of, have been extremely low\" (933). Claims While treatment success rates are not specifically cited in the Burzynski Research Institute patient brochure, such rates are widely quoted in the popular literature. An article in Macleans magazine, for example, credits Burzynski with a 46% rate of \"total remission for cancer of the colon\" from the use of one type of Antineoplaston. That article also reports that Burzynski has had the most success with cancers of the bladder, breast, prostate, and bone (291). A recent newspaper article quotes a spokeswoman for the Burzynski clinic as saying that \"preliminary studies show that 80% of tumor patients respond positively to the treatment\" (721). Burzynski does claim that the \"majority of cancer patients treated at [the Burzynski Research] Institute showed positive response to treatment\" (124). His patient brochure states that Antineoplaston treatment makes it \"possible to obtain complete remission of certain types of cancer\" and that \"the number of patients who are free of cancer over five years as the result of Antineoplaston therapy is steadily increasing\" (124). In addition to their postulated therapeutic role, Antineoplastons are claimed to be useful in diagnosing cancer. Burzynski believes that measuring the levels of naturally circulating Antineoplastons in blood and urine \"may help to identify individuals who are more susceptible to the development of cancer or to diagnose the cancer at the early stages\" (129,133). These claims are based on a number of recent clinical studies in which Burzynski reported favorable clinical outcomes, including complete remissions, partial remissions, and stabilization of disease, in patients with various types of advanced cancer, following injection of Antineoplaston A2 (137), A3 (140), A5 (141), A10 (138), AS2-1 (136), and AS2-5 Burzynski that 3 of these Antineoplastons (A3, A5, and A10) will be studied in phase II trials. Burzynski occasionally publicizes his treatment via press releases. In a recent statement, for example, it was announced that \"dramatically improved results in the treatment of prostate cancer due to a recent discovery made within the past year\" had been obtained through Burzynski's administration of Antineoplastons given orally. It noted that \"with this route of administration, some prostate cancer patients, even those whose cancer failed to respond to conventional therapy, have experienced a complete remission of their cancer in as little time as five months\" (126). In that press release and another one (127), it was claimed that Burzynski's treatment \"may also be effective in diagnosing and preventing some types of cancer,\" citing results from experimental animal studies conducted at the Burzynski Research Institute and at the University of Kurume, Japan. Published Clinical Studies Burzynski and his colleagues at the Burzynski Research Institute have a long list of published papers and presentations at meetings in which they report on animal and biochemical studies of Antineoplastons, as well as on studies of their use in cancer patients. Most of Burzynski's recent clinical papers (studies of the effects of Antineoplastons on cancer patients, as opposed to laboratory research) appear in supplements to the journal Drugs Under Experimental and Clinical Research, one in 1986 and one in 1987. These supplements were devoted entirely to Antineoplastons and all publication and printing charges for these supplements were borne by Burzynski (840). Though most medical journals do not charge authors for publishing papers, it is not uncommon for authors to pay a fee for publication and printing. Burzynski's list of publications (124) includes a number of \"phase I clinical studies,\" along with several other types of study that also include clinical outcome data, such as \"initial clinical studies,\" and \"toxicology studies.\" Many of these studies are listed as presentations made at conferences outside the United States; these reports are not readily available in the open literature. Many of the published studies appear in the Drugs Under Experimental and Clinical Research supplements, one appears in a journal or a book cited as Advances in Experimental and Clinical Chemotherapy (which is not listed at the National Library of Medicine), and one appears in a book, which presents the same data as a paper in one of the supplements. Despite the fact that these are reported as early stage studies, which in mainstream research would concentrate on toxicology (i.e., safety more than efficacy), they also report on clinical outcomes, including partial and complete remissions. Burzynski's reputation for success rests at least in part on these reports. OTA's concern with these studies is that, among other problems, Burzynski's definition of a remission, while not stated in any of the papers, appears to be discrepant from the generally accepted definition, making the results difficult if not impossible to understand. (In conventional terminology, regressions may occur in patients who initially have \"measurable disease,\" which means that tumors that can either be felt during physical examination or can be seen clearly on some type of diagnostic film or scan, and which can be measured in at least two dimensions. A complete regression is said to occur when the disease measured can no longer be found at all. Partial regression describes the condition where the measurable tumor is reduced by at least 50% in size.) Three papers from the 1987 Drugs Under Experimental and Clinical Research supplement are representative (\"Initial clinical study with Antineoplaston A2 injections in cancer patients with five years' follow-up\" (139) \"Phase I clinical studies of Antineoplaston A3 and \"Phase I clinical studies of Antineoplaston A5 injections\" (140)). These are discussed below. These three papers have similar formats and have a similar level of detail, so some general observations can be made about them. First, the reports raise a question about whether these studies were actually planned, with protocols including patient selection criteria, specific recordkeeping requirements, etc. (a \"clinical trial\"), or whether they represent groups of patients studied retrospectively. Details concerning a protocol, that would be expected in reporting a clinical trial, are generally lacking. In addition, there is little systematic information about patients' treatment prior to Antineoplastons, except in specific cases, some of which are discussed below. A table with certain information about each individual patient (diagnosis, age, sex, length of Antineoplaston treatment, highest dosage, adverse reactions, desirable side-effects, and anticancer effect) is included in each of these papers. A particular difficulty with these papers is that some important terms \u2014e.g., \"complete regression\" and \"partial regression,\" terms used to describe the effectiveness of Antineoplastons in these papers \u2014are not used in accordance with their generally-accepted definitions.4 In the first Burzynski study cited above, six \"complete remissions\" were reported among 15 patients described as having \"advanced neoplastic disease.\" Three of these six patients were reported to have non-metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, grade II, which would not be described as \"advanced\" by mainstream definitions. These three patients are described in some detail. Two of them reportedly had no measurable malignant disease when they began Antineoplaston treatment. According to the article: Patient D.D., diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, Grade II, had seven transurethral resections of the tumours and six recurrences in 16 months preceding the treatment with Antineoplaston A2. Her treatment began shortly after the last transurethral resection, therefore she did not have measurable tumour at that time. The patient was in complete remission and free from recurrences for two years and six weeks as the result of treatment with Antineoplaston A2 intravenous injections. She developed recurrence one year and two months after discontinuation of Antineoplaston A2 injections. Patient J.J....underwent transurethral resection of the tumour shortly before the beginning of the treatment with Antineoplaston A2 injections. He was found to have no recurrence after 56 days of treatment and decided to discontinue the therapy at that time. Five months later, he developed recurrence and underwent transurethral resection of the tumour and instillation of Thiotepa. The patient was disease- free for over five years. Neither of these patients had measurable malignant disease when treatment began and both had recurrences after treatment. Patient J.J. had curative conventional surgery and chemotherapy as treatment for the recurrence. Burzynski counts both of these patients as complete remissions, and J.J. as a five-year survivor, as a result of Antineoplaston treatment. However, the evidence presented does not substantiate the claimed benefit to either patient from the treatment. In the second paper, another patient in \"complete remission\" is described as having \"adenocarcinoma of the colon, status post resection,\" meaning that the tumor had been removed surgically before the patient started treatment with Antineoplastons: The patient...maintained complete remission during the treatment with Antineoplaston A3...After discontinuation of this form of treatment he developed recurrence with liver metastases, which responded to treatment with different formulations of Antineoplastons and 5-fluorouracil. This patient is alive, well and free from cancer over six years after his participation in Phase I studies with Antineoplaston A3. This patient evidently had no measurable disease when Antineoplaston A3 treatment started, but reportedly had a \"recurrence,\" was treated with conventional chemotherapy plus Antineoplastons, and then was reported free of cancer. There is no evidence that this patient was helped by Antineoplastons, and the case does not describe a \"complete remission\" attributable to that treatment. Another unusual feature of these studies is the section describing increases in platelet and white blood cell counts as \"desirable side-effects.\" In each case, the post- treatment levels are not just increased, but are abnormally high. In the case of platelet counts, levels are high enough (ranging from about 500,000 to 3.4 million) to lead to possible blood clotting. The authors do not explain why these effects should be considered desirable; physicians would usually consider these levels as indicators of underlying disease or as risks for serious medical complications. Attempts at Evaluating Antineoplastons In 1983 and 1985, at the request of the Canadian Bureau of Human Prescription Drugs, NCI tested three of Burzynski's Antineoplastons for antitumor effects in the mouse P388 Leukemia assay, a test that NCI used routinely as a prescreen for antitumor activity until 1985 (see ch. 12 for details) (2,602). No antitumor activity (as measured by a statistical increase in survival) was found for Antineoplastons A2 and A5. Both showed toxicity at the highest dose given, while at lower doses, neither antitumor effect nor toxicity was found. Both Antineoplastons were found inactive over wide dose ranges (602). Antineoplaston A10 was also tested in a range of concentrations in this mouse system, and the results indicated that there was no increase in survival at any concentration and there was toxicity at the higher dose levels (360). More recently, Antineoplaston A10 has been studied in several experimental animal tumor systems. Researchers at the Medical College of Georgia reported on results indicating that oral Antineoplaston A10 delayed the development of viral-induced mammary tumors in C3H+ mice and inhibited the growth of carcinogen-induced mammary tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats (393). Eriguchi and colleagues at Kurume University, Japan, presented results suggesting antitumor effects of Antineoplaston A10 on the development of urethane-induced pulmonary adenomas in A/WySnJ mice (275). A second group at Kurume University reported that Antineoplaston A10 reduced the growth of human breast cancer cells in athymic mice (385). Recent experiments using human and mouse tumor cell lines were summarized in an abstract written by researchers at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Maryland. It was noted that Antineoplaston AS2-1 promoted cell differentiation in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells grown in culture and suppressed some of the neoplastic properties of mouse fibrosarcoma V7T cells in culture (775). A 1981 television news report (\"20/20\") on Burzynski's cancer treatment, followed by numerous inquiries from patients about the treatment, reportedly prompted David Walde, a physician practicing in Ontario, to visit Burzynski's facilities in April 1982. In his written report (933), which he sent unsolicited to Health and Welfare Canada and to NCI, Walde described Burzynski's clinical and research facilities and summarized the treatment regimen. He reportedly also reviewed about 60 patient records, but did not report on them in detail. He concluded that there was sufficient information about Burzynski's treatment to warrant evaluating \"the nature and action of [Antineoplastons]...even if these eventually do not result in any major therapeutic advances\" and recommended that Burzynski apply for investigatory new drug clearance in Canada so that Walde could coordinate clinical studies with Canadian health officials. He also suggested that outside funding sources be sought to support clinical studies, and advised against \"sensationalism through the public media,\" to avoid disruption to ongoing and future clinical studies. In November 1982, consultants to the Ontario (Canada) Ministry of Health visited Burzynski's clinical and research facilities in Houston for the purpose of providing information to the Ministry of Health about the treatment because some Ontario residents had sought reimbursement under the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (79). After reviewing Burzynski's published papers and viewing the clinic and laboratories, the consultants, Martin Blackstein and Daniel Bergsagel, asked Burzynski to select examples of patients who he believed had had a good response to Antineoplaston treatment. They specified that each case had to satisfy the following conditions to be considered: 1) proven histologic diagnosis of cancer; 2) complete record of all cancer treatment before Antineoplastons (some of which might be responsible for a delayed response); 3) complete record of additional treatment; and 4) original X-rays, CT, or isotope scans used to document a response. Burzynski presented them with about 12 cases at the clinic, and sent them additional cases afterward. According to the report, there were original X-rays for only one case; for two others, selected CT scans were available. The case with X-ray evidence was a patient with metastatic nodules in the lung from a colon cancer, which, from his history, appeared to be a slowly progressing disease. The consultants concluded that the X-rays showed no documentable change, though there were difficulties in interpretation because the films were reportedly taken on different machines with different magnifications. They also concluded that the two patients for whom some CT scans were available showed no definite response to Antineoplaston treatment. In those cases, they believed that the views on the scans were not the same, making direct comparison impossible. In other cases, the consultants reported that Burzynski's patients had had effective treatment for treatable cancers before starting Antineoplaston treatment, and they described two specific examples. The first was a woman who had had radiation treatment for stage III cervical cancer, and had gone to Burzynski when there was still necrotic tumor in the cervix; a cytologist was unsure whether any viable cancer cells remained, but noted extensive radiation changes. The tumor gradually disappeared, which the consultants felt could be attributed to the prior radiation, rather than to Antineoplastons. The other patient had prostatic cancer with bone metastases who had had an orchiectomy three months before beginning Antineoplastons. His bone scans improved, which the consultants attributed to the delayed effects of the orchiectomy, which commonly takes months for full effects to become evident. On the basis of the cases they reviewed, Blackstein and Bersagel reported that they found no examples of objective response to Antineoplastons. In addition to reviewing the cases, they asked about four patients reported by Burzynski in 1977 to have had complete remissions with treatment. According to the report, three of those patients had progressed fairly rapidly and died. The fourth patient was still alive at the time of the review (1982), but the consultants felt his disease (a solitary bladder tumor) had disappeared as a result of the biopsy. In conclusion, Blackstein and Bersagel's report recommended that the Ontario Health Insurance Plan not cover the cost of Antineoplaston treatment for Ontario residents. Burzynski wrote a detailed rebuttal (135) to their report, charging that Blackstein and Bersagel \"completely distorted the research, production, and clinical data presented to them.\" He disagreed with each individual assessment, concluding that: Out of the initial nine cases presented in the clinic, six patients obtained complete remission and two remaining patients were very close to complete remission. Only one patient was treated with radiation and chemotherapy and one additional patient received a very small dose of palliative radiotherapy before coming for the treatment with antineoplastons. Two patients died from causes unrelated to cancer like multiple emboli in the lungs and perforation of the stomach ulcer (135). Burzynski contested the report's judgments on the quality and content of the clinical data. He cited clinical records (photocopies of which he included) to show that each case was confirmed by biopsy and that \"the remission of each of them was confirmed by at least one other doctor not associated with our clinic.\" In 1985, in a separate and more limited effort to gather information about Burzynski's treatment, the Canadian Bureau of Prescription Drugs reportedly contacted 25 physicians with patients who had visited Burzynski's clinic in Houston for treatment with Antineoplastons. According to a memo summarizing the effort (829), information on clinical outcomes in 36 patients from five provinces reportedly consisted of tumor type and clinical status as reported by telephone from the physicians (actual records were apparently not obtained). Of the 36 patients noted by the physicians, 32 had died with \"no benefit\" from the treatment, one had died after having a \"slight regression for two months,\" one died after having been stable for a year, followed by progression of disease, and two were alive at the time of the survey. Of the two who were alive, one had metastatic lung cancer and the other had cervical cancer, and both had received radiotherapy prior to Antineoplaston treatment. The memo does not indicate the existence of more detailed data on the clinical course of these patients (including time between treatment and outcome recorded) or the basis for selecting the 25 physicians for the survey. OTA's requests to the Canadian Bureau of Prescription Drugs for further information about this survey have been denied. It is not possible to draw conclusions about efficacy or safety of Antineoplaston treatment from this limited information, since it was a retrospective analysis of self-selected patients and there may have been bias toward reporting poor outcomes. Unfortunately, despite a substantial number of preliminary clinical studies presented by Burzynski and his associates describing outcomes among the patients he treated with Antineoplastons, and an attempt at a \"best case\" review, there is still a lack of valid information to judge whether this treatment is likely to be beneficial to cancer patients. Thus far, prospective, controlled clinical studies of Antineoplastons, which could yield valid information on efficacy, have not been conducted. Cellular Treatment Cellular treatment refers to a group of related procedures that may be referred to as \"live In general, cellular treatment involves injections or ingestion of processed tissue obtained from animal embryos or fetuses. It was developed in Switzerland in the early 1930's by Paul Niehans, MD, and became widely known when various public figures received the treatment and claimed it restored their youth or extended their lives (26). One of Neihans' colleagues, Wolfram Kuhnau, MD, introduced the treatment in Tijuana in the late 1970s (238,490). Currently, at least five Tijuana clinics offer cellular treatment as a component of \"metabolic therapy\" (289,968). To OTA's knowledge, cellular treatment is not widely practiced in the United States, although no Federal or State law prohibits physicians from preparing his or her own cellular treatments for patients. FDA has issued an import alert concerning the detention of shipments of foreign cellular treatment products to the United States (887). Cellular treatment uses a variety of materials, including whole fetal animal cells (derived, e.g., from sheep, cows, and recently also sharks (491)) and cell extracts from juvenile or adult animal tissue. The organs and glands used in cell treatment include brain, pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, thymus, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, heart, ovary, testis, and parotid (261). Several different types of cell can be given simultaneously \u2014some practitioners routinely give up to 20 or more at once (489). A number of different processes are used to prepare cells for use. One form of the treatment involves the injection into the buttocks of freshly removed fetal animal tissue, which has been processed and suspended in an isotonic salt solution. The preparation of fresh cells then may be either injected immediately into the patient, or preserved by being lyophilized (freeze-dried) or frozen in liquid nitrogen before being injected. In the latter process, the preserved cells can be tested for pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites, before use. Fresh cells, in contrast, are used before such testing can be performed. Other types of cellular treatment may use rehydrated concentrates in tablet or capsule form taken orally. The types of cell given are reported to correspond in some way with the organ or tissue in the patient that is diseased or malfunctioning (\"like cells help like cells\" (261)). Proponents claim that the injected cells \"travel to the similar organ from which they were taken to revitalize and stimulate that organ's function,\" an effect which is said to have been \"validated by scientifically controlled laboratory and clinical experiments\" (322). Proponents of cellular treatment believe that embryonic and fetal animal tissue contains active therapeutic agents distinct from vitamins, minerals, hormones, or enzymes, and \"the fact that these active agents have not yet been identified seems of little consequence\" (261). Kuhnau claims that cellular treatment \"stimulate[s] weak organ function and regenerate[s] its cellular structure\" (489). Proponents claim that cellular treatment is accepted by the body because \"embryonic cells from unborn animals...are immunologically inactive and hence not recognized as 'nonself' by the patient's immune system\" (238). It is stated that the cellular treatment using cells from endocrine organs \"harmonize hormones...[and] balance the intricate hormone-producing and feedback mechanisms of the endocrine system\" (238). Cellular treatment is also claimed to stimulate the immune system. Although cancer is not one of the primary conditions for which cellular treatment is promoted, cellular treatment is included in the array of treatments offered to cancer patients at \"metabolic\" clinics in Tijuana (490). Positive results following cellular treatment have been claimed for a wide variety of genetic, neurologic, and multifactorial conditions, including Down Syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, lupus, arthritis, muscular dystrophy, and infertility (238). At one Tijuana clinic where cancer patients reportedly make up 70% of the caseload, cellular treatment, using umbilical cord tissue in particular, is \"increasingly being given in cancer therapy\" at a frequency per patient of several \"rounds\" per year (238). Kuhnau claims that \"in the hands of a physician trained in this form of therapy, the proper selection of cells and their appropriate administration provides a well-tolerated treatment which is virtually free of side effects\" (489). He claims never to have seen a fatality or toxic reaction to the material (238). A number of adverse effects could, however, be associated with cellular treatment. Allergic reactions to calf thymus tissue derived from five-day-old animals were noted in patients with histiocytosis-X, a heterogeneous group of rare disorders, and cellular treatment was stopped in these patients (698). A recent report in the British Medical Journal described a case of a 79-year-old man who developed antibodies against human skin antigens and signs of an autoimmune skin disease following injections of extracts of human placental tissue (778). Cellular treatment also poses a risk of transmitting bacterial or viral infections, such as brucellosis (a generalized infection characterized by fever, sweating, and pain in the joints) or encephalomyelitis (a viral infections characterized by inflammation of the brain and spinal cord), from donor animals to recipient patients, as noted in a 1984 FDA \"talk paper\" (885). A number of serious immunological reactions to cellular treatment in West Germany were noted in a recent report in Lancet (514). In one example cited, a woman athlete reportedly received several hundred injections of cellular therapy and subsequently went into fatal anaphylactic shock. (Anaphylaxis is an immediate, exaggerated immunologic (allergic) reaction to a foreign protein to which the body has become hypersensitized as a result of past exposure. Anaphylaxis is frequently treatable with appropriate medical care, but in the absence of treatment, it can be fatal.) Other adverse effects were also noted in that report, including immune vasculitis, encephalitis, and polyradiculitis following cellular treatment, and a delayed effect of chronic progressive neurological disease with perineural inflammation and demyelination. A 1957 survey of 179 West German hospitals reportedly revealed 80 cases of serious immunological reactions, 30 of them fatal, in cellular treatment recipients. On the basis of these findings, the West German Federal Health Office suspended the product licenses of a number of commercial cellular preparations (including lyophilized or freeze-dried whole-cell preparations and cell extracts), and \"strongly recommended\" that the use of fresh cell preparations, which are made in the clinics themselves and do not come under pharmaceutical regulations, also be stopped. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a commonly available product with a wide variety of non-medical uses. In industry, it has been used as a chemical solvent. In laboratory research, it is often used as a cryopreservative for cultured cells. One of the properties of DMSO is that it is absorbed very rapidly through the skin and cell membranes, carrying along almost anything else (particularly low molecular weight molecules) dissolved in it that would not otherwise be able to cross those barriers. Intravenous and oral administration of DMSO allow it to penetrate rapidly into vascular and non- vascular tissues in the body (854). Its popular use among athletes, people with arthritis, and others have stemmed from claims that topical DMSO reduces pain, decreases swelling, and promotes healing of injured tissue. The FDA approved the use of bladder instillations of a 50% solution of DMSO (sold under the trade name \"Rimso-50\") to relieve symptoms of interstitial cystitis, a painful chronic bladder disorder (884). At present, \"Rimso-50\" is still the only DMSO product approved by FDA for use in humans. DMSO available in health food stores or by mail order is an industrial form of the chemical, consisting of about 99% DMSO, and is not labeled for human use (45). DMSO is commonly used in unconventional cancer treatments, particularly in \"metabolic\" treatments, such as those offered at several clinics in Tijuana and in the United States (e.g., at a hospital in Zion, Illinois and at clinics in Nevada, Pennsylvania, and California (289)). DMSO is often combined with laetrile and vitamin C, among other substances, and administered to patients intravenously. For example, the \"Manner Cocktail,\" consisting of 10cc of DMSO, 25 grams of vitamin C, and 9 grams of laetrile dissolved in a 250cc bag of a 5% dextrose solution (574), is used to treat cancer patients at the Manner Clinic in Tijuana. DMSO has been studied in mainstream research for a variety of possible therapeutic uses. As a possible cytotoxic agent, DMSO has been studied in human tumor cell lines and in human tumor model systems in animals, and in each case, DMSO demonstrated no activity (243). As a possible tumor differentiating agent (942) (a substance that stimulates tumor cells to undergo development to mature, benign cells (827)), DMSO was found to be active in mouse and human leukemic cell cultures and in human solid tumor cell cultures (243,827), but it did not improve survival in animals implanted with human tumor cells (243); this lack of an effect in vivo is the basis for NCI classifying DMSO as a relatively weak differentiating agent, compared to other available agents (243). As a potential enhancer of the activity of known cytotoxic agents, DMSO was found to increase the activity of some of these agents in tumor-bearing rats (854). DMSO has been tested experimentally for antitumor effects, both in various tissue culture and in animal systems, and was found to be inactive. In a clinical study using DMSO in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, DMSO did not enhance the effect of cyclophosphamide (319). One of the most widely available sources of information about the use of DMSO in unconventional cancer treatments is the booklet commonly available in health food stores, Dr. Donsbach Tells You What You Always Wanted to Know About DMSO (263). In this booklet, it is claimed that \"while DMSO has not brought 'cure' for health problems, it has been and is now the source of comfort for millions of medical consumers.\" Donsbach states that DMSO acts by making cancer cells \"behave more normally by bringing about a mitotic turnabout.\" He proposes its use as a treatment to relieve pain, to slow the growth of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, to control inflammation and swelling, to relieve burns and sprains, and to relieve the symptoms of arthritis, herpes, tuberculosis, sinusitis, and cancer. Another source in the popular literature discusses the use of DMSO in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (593). Mildred Miller, an advocate of DMSO use in cancer treatment (616), claims that intravenous DMSO \"dissolves the protein shell surrounding the cancer cells and begins to restore the abnormal cell to normalcy\" (615) and that it \"stimulate[s] the body's own immune system, as well as altering the cancer cell, causing it to become mature or burn out\" (617). Miller is associated with a clinic in Las Vegas that uses DMSO as one of its main components of cancer treatment. Topical application of DMSO has been associated with redness, itching, and inflammation of the skin and a garlic- like taste and odor on the breath. Intravenous administration of DMSO has been reported to cause transient hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells), resulting in urinary excretion of hemoglobin (45,983). Several additional adverse effects of DMSO are mentioned in the Donsbach booklet (263), including \"possible damaging effects to the liver, the kidneys, bloodforming organs, and the central nervous system\"; and \"headache, dizziness, nausea, and sedation.\" Toxic effects to the lens of the eye were reported in studies involving the use of DMSO in dogs, rabbits, and pigs, although no such effects have been noted in studies with human subjects (45). The safety of prolonged use of DMSO in humans has not been established. Hydrazine Sulfate In the mid-1970s, one of the commonly discussed unconventional cancer treatments was hydrazine sulfate (646,682), a chemical agent proposed to treat cancer cachexia, the progressive weight loss and debilitation characteristic of advanced cancer. On the basis of animal data and preliminary human studies conducted in the United States and the Soviet Union (described below), hydrazine sulfate was also claimed to cause tumor regression and subjective improvement in cancer patients. According to one observer (743), hydrazine sulfate was publicized in the news media as a \"dramatic breakthrough \u2014bringing people back from the dead.\" The American Cancer Society (ACS) published its first \"Unproven Methods\" statement on hydrazine sulfate in 1976 (24). In 1979, however, it was taken off the ACS list of unproven methods, following the initiation of clinical trials under a new IND exemption (90), although this change was not publicly made until 1982, when the next revised list was published. While hydrazine sulfate has, in the last few years, been studied by some mainstream researchers, it is still considered as an unconventional treatment. Articles in the popular literature continue to highlight controversial issues in hydrazine sulfate's development (416,549,647). Proponents argue that the primary emphasis on treating cachexia, rather than the tumor itself, resulted in hydrazine sulfate being not only ignored but maligned by conventional medicine. In a 1988 interview with a Washington Post reporter, the former director of NCI, Vincent DeVita, Jr., reinforced this view of why hydrazine sulfate was not received more enthusiastically by the oncologic community: You have to distinguish between good ideas and bad ideas and ho-hum ideas. And hydrazine, I think, is a ho-hum idea. The key thing is not to prevent people from losing weight while they die; the key thing is to get rid of their cancer, and that was always the issue. The trouble was nobody saw the value of pumping a lot of resources into a therapy that gave you plumper people by the time they died (767). The initial proponent of hydrazine sulfate was Joseph Gold, MD, director of the Syracuse Cancer Research Institute in New York. Gold proposed a biochemical mechanism for primary tumor growth and progression and for the development of cachexia (345). He hypothesized that cancer cachexia results from a systematic energy-losing cycle involving glycolysis in tumor cells and gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney, and proposed that an interruption in this metabolic circuit could result in clinical improvement (347). After considering a number of possible agents capable of interfering with the process, Gold settled on hydrazine sulfate as a likely inhibitor of a key enzyme in the process (348,350). In 1973, Gold reported on results of experimental animal tests indicating that hydrazine sulfate inhibited the growth of various rodent tumors and potentiated antitumor action of some chemotherapeutic drugs (346). Several groups, including investigators at Calbiochem (a pharmaceutical company), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and the Medical College of Virginia, obtained IND exemptions to study the efficacy and safety of hydrazine sulfate in cancer patients. Positive publicity about hydrazine sulfate at a 1974 meeting of the National Health Federation, an advocacy group for unconventional treatment, led the public to request hydrazine sulfate directly from the company. The FDA later stopped the company from selling it to patients and withdrew all INDs on the agent. In 1975, Gold reported results of the descriptive study of hydrazine sulfate conducted under Calbiochem's IND (349). Using reports from physicians whose advanced cancer patients were taking hydrazine sulfate, Gold noted several cases of tumor regression and subjective improvement, and some adverse effects, such as numbness in the extremities and transient nausea. A uncontrolled study conducted in the Soviet Union also reported tumor regression and subjective improvement among patients taking hydrazine sulfate(794). This latter study was followed up with a larger descriptive study in the Soviet Union that reported some cases of partial regression, stabilization, and subjective improvement (324). In contrast, three small, uncontrolled clinical studies found no evidence of tumor regression among advanced cancer patients taking hydrazine sulfate (527,690,828). More recent clinical studies of hydrazine sulfate have examined effects other than antitumor responses. Rowan Chlebowski, MD, PhD, and his colleagues at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) have examined the effect of hydrazine sulfate on metabolism and weight loss in cancer patients. In 1984 and 1987 papers describing biochemical studies, Chlebowski reported that hydrazine sulfate is metabolically active, improves abnormal glucose tolerance, and reduces the increased glucose production rates seen in cancer patients with weight loss (187,849). These studies did not examine clinical outcomes in patients given hydrazine sulfate. In a separate study, Chlebowski and colleagues examined the effects of a 30-day hydrazine sulfate treatment regimen on weight, appetite, and caloric intake in cancer patients (185). The study was not designed to measure changes in tumor growth, since indicators of measurable disease were not required of patients entering the study, and concurrent chemotherapy was permitted. Sixty-one of the patients entered into the study were randomized to hydrazine sulfate or placebo; forty additional patients were assigned hydrazine sulfate and included in the study results. Approximately half of the patients were evaluable after 30 days, which greatly reduced the actual size of the study. Unfortunately, results from the randomized and nonrandomized groups were combined, and the report does not state how many patients from the randomized group were in the evaluable group included in the results. Reporting only in percentages, the authors stated that a higher percentage of the patients on hydrazine sulfate maintained or increased their weight, improved their appetite, and increased their caloric intake, suggesting a beneficial effect on these clinical measures. However, valid judgments about such differences could be drawn only from the randomized data, which were not presented apart from data on the serially treated patients. Nevertheless, the study did provide suggestive evidence that hydrazine sulfate might improve outcomes in cancer patients with cachexia, suggesting the need for further research. Stronger evidence of hydrazine sulfate's effects on cancer patients comes from the most recent study reported by Chlebowski and colleagues (186). A randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to assess changes in nutritional status and survival time as a result of hydrazine sulfate taken in addition to cisplatin- containing combination chemotherapy. Sixty-five patients with advanced, unresectable (non-operable) non-small-cell lung cancer were randomized to chemotherapy and hydrazine sulfate (oral doses of 60 mg per day) or to chemotherapy and placebo. These patients had had no prior chemotherapy and were described as being partially or fully ambulatory (performance status 0 to 2). All patients received the same defined nutritional counseling. Nutritional status was found to be improved in patients taking hydrazine sulfate: they had significantly greater caloric intake and albumin maintenance. In previous studies, a low serum albumin level in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer was found to be predictive of poor survival time, while maintenance of serum albumin level was found to be significantly predictive of better two-year survival in patients with this type of cancer. Median survival time among patients in the study was found to be greater among those taking hydrazine sulfate (292 days) than those taking the placebo (197 days), but this difference was not statistically significant. Differences in survival time did reach statistical significance when the patients were separated into two groups \u2014approximately 35 patients in relatively better condition (performance status 0 or 1), and approximately 30 patients in more impaired condition (performance status 2). Those patients in better condition who took hydrazine sulfate lived significantly longer (328 days) than those taking placebo (209 days). Forty-two percent of these patients taking hydrazine sulfate were alive at one year, compared to 18% of those taking placebo. There was no similar increase in median survival for patients in relatively worse condition; both treatment groups in this case had a median survival of 132 days. Hydrazine sulfate was not found to have a direct antitumor effect on patients in either group. No complete responses were found, and among the partial responses noted, 23% were in patients taking hydrazine, while 29% were found in patients taking the placebo. These were presumably attributable to the chemotherapy. Based on the results showing that hydrazine sulfate improved nutritional status in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and increased survival time in the subset of those patients who were more fully ambulatory, the authors suggested that hydrazine sulfate warrants further evaluation as an adjunct to conventional treatment. As they noted, the modest size of this trial limits the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn from it. The results were sufficiently promising, though, to have recently prompted NCI to sponsor one or more phase III randomized studies designed to further evaluate the influence of hydrazine sulfate on clinical outcomes in cancer patients (316). Laetrile Laetrile is perhaps the best known unconventional cancer treatment of the past two decades. In the mid-1970s, an estimated 70,000 people had used it for cancer treatment, pain control, or cancer prevention (274), and by 1979, 21 States had legalized its use (722). During the same period, laetrile had become the focus of a political and legal controversy about patients' access to unapproved drugs (see ch. 10) (396,525,578,648,705). Since the early 1980's, laetrile has lost much of its popular appeal, but is currently available at many of the unconventional cancer clinics in Mexico, used by U.S. patients. Amygdalin, laetrile, Laetrile (capitalized), sarcarcinase, and nitriloside are some of the names of chemically related substances given to patients as laetrile treatment (903). Proponents have also referred to the treatment as a vitamin (\"B-17\") even though it has never been recognized as such by the scientific community. One of these names, Laetrile, is the tradename for a substance chemically related to amygdalin, a substance found naturally in pits of apricots and other fruits. In this report, the term \"laetrile\" is used to refer generally to this group of closely related substance(s) used in unconventional cancer treatment. Laetrile was named in reference to its biochemical properties; it was laevorotatory, or left-handed, to polarized light and belonged to the mandelonitrile class of chemicals. Laetrile was developed from an extract of amygdalin by Ernst Krebs Sr., MD, and Ernst Krebs, Jr., and was first used to treat cancer patients in California in the early 1950's. Its use in the United States, Mexico, and Canada gradually expanded in the 1960s, as various laboratories were set up to produce and market the substance (985). The popularity of laetrile increased dramatically in the early 1970's when members of the ultraconservative John Birch Society came to the aid of a physician and fellow member who had been arrested for illegally treating patients with laetrile. Using this case as a starting point, several Birch Society members joined together to found the \"Committee for the Freedom of Choice in Cancer Therapy,\" primarily to advocate the right of cancer patients to use laetrile (722). Other groups, such as the Cancer Control Society and the National Health Federation, actively promoted the use and legalization of laetrile (962). With the support of Andrew McNaughton, a Canadian businessman, several factories around the world were built to manufacture laetrile (101). Some proponents of laetrile cite a theory of cancer etiology known as the \"unitarian\" or \"trophoblastic\" theory as the basis for treating cancer with laetrile. First proposed by John Beard in 1902 and later expanded on by Ernst Krebs, Jr., in the 1940s and 1950s, that theory draws a connection between cancer cells and trophoblast cells, which are cells present during pregnancy that are thought to protect the fertilized egg from rejection by the woman's immune system. Both cancer cells and the trophoblast cells are described in the trophoblast theory as invasive, erosive, corrosive, and capable of being carried through the bloodstream to other parts of the body. According to the theory, trophoblast cells could develop at various places in the body from precursor cells distributed throughout the body during embryonic development, and that these precursor cells could, under certain circumstances, become cancer cells. Laetrile proponents have also proposed that cancer is a deficiency disease caused by a lack of laetrile (\"vitamin B-17\") in the diet (362). When laetrile is subjected to enzymatic breakdown in the body, it breaks down into three chemicals: glucose, benzaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide (545). Various preparations of benzaldehyde have been studied recently, mainly in Japan, for antitumor activity in experimental animals (581) and in preliminary clinical studies (481,482). Cyanide has well known toxic effects on human cells, both normal and malignant (197). Laetrile proponents claim that laetrile kills tumor cells selectively, while leaving normal cells alone. In support of this, Ernst Krebs, Jr., hypothesized that normal cells produce an enzyme, beta-glucosidase, that breaks down laetrile, releasing cyanide, which is then converted by a second enzyme, rhodanese, to the less toxic thiocyanate molecule; cancer cells, however, lack the enzyme rhodanese, according to Krebs' theory, and therefore are killed by the free cyanide (704,903). In the 1970's, proponents claimed that laetrile had direct antitumor effects, relieved pain associated with advanced cancer, and helped to prevent cancer (903). In recent years, specific claims of antitumor activity of laetrile have rarely been made. Instead, laetrile is more often discussed in the context of \"metabolic\" regimens, with claims made for antitumor responses and life extension resulting from the use of a combination of treatments, including laetrile, DMSO, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, oxygen treatment, cellular treatment, and other substances (97,239,576). Adverse Effects Since laetrile itself is about 6% cyanide by weight, cyanide toxicity is possible when laetrile is broken down in the body. If an excessive amount of laetrile is ingested, or if something is done to accelerate or increase the release of cyanide from laetrile, then toxic and lethal levels of cyanide can be reached. B-glucosidase, the enzyme that can markedly accelerate the release of cyanide from laetrile, is found in common foods as such raw almonds, other nuts, bean and alfalfa sprouts, peaches, lettuce, celery, and mushrooms (784). When laetrile is simultaneously ingested with a source of the B-glucosidase enzyme, toxic cyanide levels may result. Cyanide toxicity has been observed in patients receiving laetrile, although many patients have taken it without showing any significant clinical signs of cyanide toxicity (620,623). Common adverse effects noted in the studies (described later in this section) by Moertel and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic were nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. Isolated reports of deaths due to cyanide poisoning following the ingestion of laetrile have appeared in the literature (100,585,644,697,768,779,800,811). Samples of Mexican laetrile were examined at NCI for potency, content, and quality of manufacture (248,249). It was found that the measured potency of the samples differed substantially from the labeled potency. In addition, of approximately 1500 ampules that were examined visually, about 400 contained particulate matter, and 20 showed microbial growth (primarily budding yeast and fungal hyphae), indicating contamination of the material. These contaminants pose additional risks of complications, especially when given intravenously to patients who may be immunosuppressed. Bradford and colleagues at the American Biologics clinic in Tijuana have noted the existence of \"pure\" and \"decomposed and degraded\" products sold as laetrile or amygdalin (97). Attempts at Evaluating Laetrile Since the 1950s, laetrile has been examined for antitumor activity in a variety of experimental test systems. Its use in cancer patients has also been described by several proponents and it has been the subject of clinical trials sponsored by NCI. These efforts are summarized below. Animal Studies Laetrile has been tested for antitumor activity in a variety of transplanted rodent tumor systems. Experiments were conducted in several different laboratories under NCI sponsorship in 1957, 1960, 1969 (twice), and 1973, testing the effects of laetrile alone or in combination with beta glucosidase. These experiments used several different sources of laetrile and a variety of transplanted rodent tumor systems, and in each case, no antitumor activity was found (906). Other investigators have tested laetrile alone (183,404,838) or laetrile with beta glucosidase (519,965) in transplanted rodent tests. No antitumor activity has been found in any of these experiments. Laetrile alone and in combination with beta glucosidase has also been tested for antitumor activity in human tumor xenografts in athymic (nude) mice. Using MX-1 mammary or CX-2 colon tumor xenografts in these mice, no antitumor effects of laetrile with or without the enzyme were found (701). Spontaneous animal tumor systems have also been used in a variety of tests involving laetrile. In a study often cited in the proponent literature, Harold Manner and colleagues (575) treated mice that had spontaneous mammary tumors with the following three agents, tested individually and in various combinations: laetrile (50 mg/kg body weight per day injected intramuscularly), vitamin A (333,333 IU/kg body weight per day administered via stomach tube), and digestive enzymes (10 mg injected every other day \"directly into and around the tumor mass\"). The animals were observed for signs of tumor regression during a 30-day period of treatment. According to the published report, no tumor regressions were observed in the animals treated with laetrile alone, vitamin A alone, or laetrile and vitamin A in combination. Tumor regressions were observed in the four treatment groups receiving the digestive enzymes (and a few in the control groups); in these animals, ulcerations containing necrotic malignant cells in viscous fluid were found at the tumor sites. Fifty-two percent or more of the tumors regressed in the groups treated with enzymes alone, enzymes and vitamin A in combination, enzymes and laetrile in combination, or enzymes, vitamin A, and laetrile in combination. The highest percentage was found in the latter group, in which all three treatments were given. The authors concluded that laetrile given alone is \"not effective in tumor regression\" but that when all three are given at the same time, \"76% of the tumors do completely regress.\" It appears from the results, however, that the main effect observed was the immediate proteolytic effect of injecting digestive enzymes directly into tumor masses. The largest and most complex set of tests on laetrile in animals was described by Chester Stock and colleagues at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn and Queens (837). One of the investigators at Sloan-Kettering, Kanematsu Sugiura, conducted six initial experiments using CD8F1 mice with spontaneous mammary tumors, and found that the mice treated with laetrile showed no significant prevention of growth of primary tumors, but did show inhibition in the development of lung metastases. In an unusual sequence of events, unauthorized information about these experiments was made public before the results were confirmed independently, leading to allegations by proponents that \"proof\" of laetrile's effectiveness had been obtained and then suppressed by the Sloan-Kettering researchers (240,648,813). These experiments were followed by a series of five experiments designed to replicate Sugiura's initial experiments. In two blinded experiments, the assessment of tumor status was done in such a way that the observer did not know whether the mice had had laetrile or the control treatment. This was intended to address the issue of unintentional bias in observing the presence of metastases, since the two methods that Sugiura used to detect metastases \u2014 gross observation and microscopic analysis \u2014were reported to be inherently subjective, while another method he did not use, bioassay, was reported to be less subject to bias. These independent and blind experiments (including those Sugiura participated in) did not confirm Sugiura's initial results. The authors concluded that in the spontaneous animal tumor system, \"laetrile was found to possess neither preventive, nor tumor-regressant, nor antimetastatic, nor curative anticancer activity.\" The report summarizing both Sugiura's work and the independent experiments (on which Sugiura was a coauthor) noted that Sugiura believed his initial results were valid and that laetrile had antimetastatic activity. In an addendum to the paper, Daniel Martin, Chester Stock, and Robert Good added that the negative results of the blind experiments suggested that Sugiura's initial experiments were unknowingly biased, and reiterated their conclusion that laetrile had \"no action against the formation of metastases in the spontaneous tumor system.\" Human Studies From the 1950s until the late 1970s, laetrile was reported to have been used widely, not only in the United States, but also in Europe, Mexico, and elsewhere. Descriptions by practitioners of its use in cancer patients appeared in various books and journals. These include a 1962 book by Howard Beard on the trophoblastic theory of cancer (381), a 1962 report in a U.S. medical journal written by a New Jersey surgeon (643), numerous reports by a physician in the Philippines (e.g., (662)), an abstract and presentation by practitioners in Italy and Belgium (765), papers by Dean Burk and Hans Nieper (e.g., (110)), and a 1977 book describing patients treated at a California clinic (758). None of these reports describes controlled, prospective trials from which valid judgments of laetrile's effects could be made. They were probably influential in increasing the popularity of the drug, however, since they all reported good results believed to be specifically related to laetrile. In the mid-1970s, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) attempted to obtain documented evidence of objective responses to laetrile, using an approach designed to collect information from the records of people who themselves claimed, or whose practitioners claimed, had been treated successfully. The intention was not to try to estimate possible rates of effectiveness, or to document adverse effects. Retrospective Review of Cases NCI sent nearly half a million letters to physicians, other health professionals, and pro-laetrile groups, asking for documented case histories of patients who had shown objective responses to laetrile (274). Consent of the patient or next of kin, confirmatory histologic material, measurable disease, adequately documented history, use of laetrile with or without metabolic treatment for a period of at least 30 days, with at least a 30-day period preceding during which no conventional cancer treatment was given, and records in English were required for cases submitted. Supporting information for each submitted case was sought from physicians, clinics, hospitals, and laboratories. The solicitation and review of the public record resulted in identifying 230 patients with claimed objective responses from laetrile, all of whom (or the next-of-kin) were asked to authorize release of their medical records. Ninety-three gave permission, and after assembling the records for all cases, 26 were found to be insufficient for review (many because requested records were not sent). The review was based on the 67 remaining laetrile-treated cases (one of whom had two separate courses of laetrile). In an attempt to avoid personal biases against laetrile in the evaluation, 26 case histories of patients with similar disease who received conventional treatment, but not laetrile, were pulled from the NCI files, and added to the laetrile cases. A summary of the clinical course of each of the 93 cases, without specifying whether the patient had or had not received laetrile, was presented to a panel of 12 expert clinical oncologists from outside NCI for their independent review. A group consensus was then reached after discussing the results of the individual reviews. By consensus, there were two complete remissions, four partial remissions, nine cases of stable disease, and seven cases of progressive disease. Thirty-five cases were non- evaluable, meaning that they did not meet original criteria for cases, and 11 had insufficient data on which to judge response. Of the patients from the NCI files who had not had laetrile, one, who had not had any treatment, was judged to have had a partial response. Despite attempts to blind the panelists to whether the patients had had laetrile, a higher-than-expected proportion answered correctly when asked to guess whether patients had had laetrile or other treatment. However, the consensus for the six laetrile-treated patients determined to have had partial or complete responses, and three determined to have had an increased disease-free survival, was that they had received conventional chemotherapy. The discussion in the report of that review illustrates the difficulty in interpreting results such as these. The authors make a number of useful points. First, the rather small number of cases submitted in relation to the solicitation effort, and the loss of cases due to sources not submitting requested information, left a relatively small number of evaluable cases. It is unclear what NCI could have done differently to increase the number of cases submitted. The authors also commented that cases rejected from the review as inevaluable were not necessarily examples of poor medical management or of patients who may not have benefited from laetrile. The necessary rigor of NCI's process alone determined their evaluability. A natural tendency is to want to compute a \"response rate\" using these data, but, in fact, there is no valid means to do so, therefore these data cannot be summarized in a meaningful statistical sense. A number of explanations for the six cases determined to have benefited after laetrile treatment are offered in the published report. First, it is possible that the patients responded to laetrile, but in this type of study, that explanation cannot be assumed true: Submission of incorrect clinical interpretations, falsified data, intentional or unintentional omission of data (for example, concurrent conventional therapy), the possibility that we were unaware of some physicians treating these patients or non-response to our inquiries must all be considered in interpreting these findings....Spontaneous regressions of tumors, although rare, have been documented...with frequency varying according to tumor type. Even in the absence of true spontaneous regression, the well documented variability in the natural history of some tumors may confuse interpretation (904) and, in fact, the panel judged by consensus that a partial response occurred in one patient receiving no treatment during the course evaluated. The patients treated with Laetrile were almost always given concomitant metabolic therapy...as well as general supportive-care measures such as improved diet, psychologic support and the unmeasurable ingredient of hope. This fact makes it difficult to attribute any tumor responses to Laetrile alone. The authors suggested, however, that the data would be used by NCI in determining if further study is needed. A prospective trial, described below, was conducted following the case review. Phase I and II Clinical Trials After the laetrile case review described above, NCI sponsored phase I and II clinical trials, which were carried out at the Mayo Clinic. In the phase I study (620), information about dosage and toxicity was gathered in preparation for the phase II study (623), which is described here. One hundred seventy-eight patients with advanced cancers were treated with amygdalin, according to a regimen \"representative of current Laetrile practice,\" and were prescribed a diet and vitamin supplements designed by the investigators to be similar to metabolic regimens offered by many laetrile practitioners. A subgroup (14 patients with colorectal cancer) was given a high-dose regimen of both amygdalin and supplements, resembling high-dose regimens used by some laetrile practitioners. About a third of the patients had colorectal cancer, the next largest categories being lung, breast, and melanoma, with rare cancers represented by fewer patients. All patients had disease for which no conventional treatment was available, though none was bedridden and all were able to eat normally. Most of the patients were capable of working at least part time. About a third of the patients had had no chemotherapy at all. This is of interest because some metabolic practitioners claim that laetrile and metabolic therapy are more effective in patients whose immune systems have not been damaged by chemotherapy. The amygdalin was prepared by NCI from apricot pits, corresponding to the laetrile sold by major suppliers to U.S. patients. It was administered intravenously for 21 days, followed by continued oral dosage, and stopped with progression of the cancer or severe \"clinical deterioration.\" Amygdalin was also stopped if an extremely high blood cyanide level was reached (3 micrograms per milliliter); this was the case for three patients. Standard criteria were used to assess patient response. An \"objective response\" had to meet the following three conditions: 1) at least a 50% decrease in a particular measurement of the most clearly measurable tumor area of an originally chosen \"indicator lesion\" (or if malignant enlarged liver were the measurable disease, a 30% decrease in a particular measurement); 2) no increase in the size of other areas of malignant disease; and 3) no new areas of malignant disease. Two criteria had to be met to be classified as in \"stable condition:\" 1) less than 50% decrease in the measurement referred to above in the first criterion for an objective response; and 2) no new areas of malignant disease. Meeting any one of three criteria constituted \"objective progression:\" 1) an increase of more than 25% in any indicator lesion; 2) new areas of malignant disease; or 3) severe clinical deterioration precluding further therapy and observation. The study found that one of the 175 evaluable patients met the criteria for a partial response (at least 50% decrease in size, but not disappearance of lesion), and that response was transient. More than half of the patients had measurable progression at the end of the three-week intravenous amygdalin course. By the end of two months, about 80% had measurable disease, and by seven months, all patients had progressed. The median survival (the point after starting treatment at which half the patients had died) was 4.8 months. The 14 high-dose patients were similar in these outcomes to the entire group. There was little evidence in this trial population of symptomatic relief. Few people gained weight, and improvements in performance status for those originally impaired were few. Twenty percent of patients claimed some symptomatic benefit at some point during treatment, but this was generally short-lived. After 10 weeks, 5% of patients reported still receiving benefit. Toxicities were generally mild when patients adhered strictly to the treatment schedules. Typical symptoms of cyanide toxicity \u2014 nausea, vomiting, headache, and mental dullness \u2014occurred in some cases, particularly when patients took more amygdalin during a specified time period than was prescribed (e.g., when a dose was missed, and the patient \"made it up\"). The authors stated that survival times of patients in the trial \"appear to be consistent with the anticipated survivals in comparable patients receiving inactive treatment or no treatment.\" When challenged on this point in a letter to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine (709), the investigators compared the survival curve of colorectal cancer patients in the trial to survival of colorectal patients who had received new chemotherapeutic agents at the Mayo Clinic, and found no difference (619). The study was not designed, however, to determine if amygdalin causes moderate increases in lifespan (or improvements in wellbeing or pain control), since it did not include a randomized control group, and thus the author's comparison is not entirely valid. The study was criticized by laetrile supporters, who claimed that the material NCI used was not \"Laetrile,\" but in fact, a \"degraded product\" (237). However, the NCI product was prepared to correspond to one of several popular formulations being administered to U.S. patients at the time, and the regimen used in the study did reflect then current practices of proponents. If the treatment had the antitumor activity claimed for it, a substantial number of patients in this trial should have shown objective responses. As it turned out, only one out of 175 patients studied showed a response \u2014a partial, transient tumor response \u2014 which was far below expectations based on proponents' claims of laetrile's efficacy. The Livingston-Wheeler Regimen More than 40 years ago, the late Virginia (Wuerthele Casp,) Livingston-Wheeler, M.D., reported that she identified a specific microorganism she believed was associated with the development and progression of cancer. [Officially, she used the name Virginia C. Livingston, M.D. Dr. Livingston died shortly before this OTA Report was finished.] During the 1950s, she developed a comprehensive theory of cancer causation based on this common infective agent and designed a corresponding antiinfective treatment \u2014an autogenous vaccine designed to treat and prevent infection with the microbe that she believed causes cancer. The current treatment regimen, offered at an outpatient clinic in San Diego, includes a variety of components intended to bolster patients' immune responses in general and to counteract effects of microbial infection. These components, which have changed over time, include antibiotics, vitamin and mineral supplements, and a special diet. The Livingston-Wheeler treatment was added to the ACS list of unproven methods in 1968 (23). In Feb., 1990, Livingston was issued a cease and desist order by the California Department of Health Services to stop prescribing and administering the autogenous vaccine as part of her treatment regimen (831). The Department found that the use of the vaccine by the Livingston-Wheeler Clinic violated California's Health and Safety Code, which \"prohibits the sale, providing, or prescribing of any cancer drug, medicine, compound, or device unless it has been scientifically proven to be safe and effective in the diagnosis, treatment, alleviation, or cure of cancer and an application therefore has been approved by the Department or the United States Food and Drug Administration.\" After receiving her M.D. from New York University in 1936, Dr. Livingston held a number of academic, clinical, and laboratory positions, including associate professor in the Bureau of Biological Research at Rutgers University and associate professor of microbiology at the University of San Diego (563). In 1969, she established the Livingston-Wheeler Clinic, where she was director, and began treating cancer patients on a full-time basis. Livingston was one of the most widely known practitioners of unconventional cancer treatment in the United States. Since her death, the clinic has been called the Livingston Medical Center. Livingston's hypothesis on the role of infectious agents in the etiology of cancer originated from her work in the mid- 1940s on scleroderma, a systemic, autoimmune connective tissue disorder. Comparing tuberculosis, leprosy, scleroderma, and cancer, she noted that \"all four diseases are characterized by a simultaneous process of production and destruction of tissue and by a progressive, systemic involvement of the host\" (971). She redirected her research from the bacteriology of scleroderma to that of cancer, beginning with tissue from a patient with breast cancer. In a paper published in 1950 (973), Livingston reported on a group of microorganisms that she isolated from tumor tissue. She referred to these organisms as a single culture and described the various forms in which they appeared: \"minute filterable granules beyond the limits of visibility of the light microscope,\" \"larger granules approximately the size of ordinary cocci readily seen with the light microscope,\" \"globoidal forms,\" \"rod-like forms with irregular staining,\" and \"globoidal forms which appear to undergo polar budding.\" She reported that she did not find these forms in the tissues of healthy individuals, and suggested that this organism might be of primary or secondary importance in the etiology of cancer. Although admittedly not the first to culture microorganisms from tumor cells, Livingston believed that she was the first to postulate interrelationships among the observed bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasma. To do this, she examined the \"developmental cycle of the organism through each transitional phase\" using specific growth media, differential staining, high power microscopic resolution, and electron microscopy. She concluded that these phases represented different developmental forms of the same microorganism (974), which she characterized as \"pleomorphic,\" a term used in microbiology to refer to bacteria that change in size and shape during their life cycle (also called \"cell wall deficient\" bacteria) (584). She reported that these different forms included micrococci, diphtheroids, bacilli, fungi, viruses, and host-cell inclusions (977). In 1970, Livingston proposed a formal classification for this microbe and described her method for isolating and culturing it (978). She classified it under the order Actinomycetales, which includes the bacteria associated with tuberculosis and leprosy, and named her microbe Progenitor cryptocides (PC), meaning \"the ancestral, or primordial, hidden killer\" (563). Livingston believed that P. cryptocides is ubiquitous in patients with cancer and, contrary to her earlier observation, that it is also present in some individuals without apparent disease (560). She believed that in a healthy person, this microbe is maintained at low levels in the body, but under some conditions, it can multiply in overwhelming numbers and become invasive and tumor-promoting (978). Special staining methods were developed by Livingston and her colleagues to determine the degree of latent or overt infection, an indicator that she used to determine the progress of the disease during treatment (979). To examine their potential for causing disease, Livingston inoculated mice and guinea pigs with cultures of P. cryptocides and reported a \"wide range of neoplastic tissue changes\" in the inoculated animals (972,978). These results were confirmed by Irene Diller at the Institute for Cancer Research in Philadelphia (255,256). On the basis of these experiments, Livingston concluded that P. cryptocides was pathogenic in animals, and extrapolated this pathogenicity to humans. She believed that P. cryptocides is the \"primary etiologic agent in proliferative and degenerative diseases\" (977) and claims that her work proves it to be the causative agent in all cancers. In the absence of clinical studies examining the possible role that Progenitor cryptocides might play in the development of cancer, however, the pathogenicity of this microbe or group of microbes in humans remains unresolved. There is little support, outside of a few researchers (see, e.g., (106)) for Livingston's belief that the different microbes observed in tissues and blood of cancer patients are actually different forms of the same organism. At present, no independent evidence exists to corroborate her contention that the microbial forms are related to each other as different forms of a single, pleomorphic organism. Evidence does show that the bacterial culture Livingston isolated is not a new and unique species as claimed: P. cryptocides cultures supplied by Livingston were identified as different species of the genus Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (3,4,258). The issue of isolating bacteria of any kind from tumor tissue and urine of cancer patients, however, is generally not disputed, since many groups of researchers have reported isolating various species and strains of bacteria from such sources (see, e.g., (3,62,209)). Some of these bacteria have also been shown to undergo morphologic alterations characteristic of cell wall deficient (or pleomorphic) bacteria (4). Acevedo and others have looked into the effect that these organisms might have on the body's immune response to malignant cells (4). During the course of her research into the properties of P. cryptocides, Livingston discovered that this microbial culture produces a substance in vitro that is closely related to the human hormone chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (980). [Human chorionic gonadotropin is a hormone secreted in pregnancy by the trophoblast cells that form the outer part of the embryo and allow implantation. In early pregnancy, this hormone plays a role in maintaining the lining of the uterus and in preventing spontaneous abortion of the fetus.] Her report was the first to document the production of a mammalian hormone-like substance by microorganisms, and this has been confirmed by other investigators (209,580). Others have observed that a protein similar to hCG produced in vivo by a variety of microorganisms (5). The hormone has been found in tumor tissue isolated from cancer patients, though not from every species of bacteria isolated from cancer patients; it has also been found in bacterial isolates from individuals without clinical manifestations of cancer (3). These findings suggest that the production of a chorionic gonadotropin-like substance by human tissues or microorganisms is not uniquely associated with cancer, although they do not rule out a possible role for the hormone in the development of some cancers. Researchers have suggested the possibility that chorionic gonadotropin, whether produced by human cells (691) or by bacterially- infected human tumor tissue, may suppress certain immune responses (517), and that substances acting against hCG may inhibit the growth of malignant cells (471). Livingston believed that P. cryptocides is \"an essential but dormant part of all cells,\" and is normally kept in check by a fully functional immune system. She believed that \"when immunity is suppressed or weakened, P. cryptocides proliferate and allow cancer to gain a foothold, secreting the same (chorionic gonadotropin) hormone found in abundance in all tumors.\" She viewed cancer as an \"immune deficiency disease\" caused by specific inadequacies in the diet and by toxic chemicals in the environment. She stated in her 1984 book, \"the modern diet is simply deficient in providing the nutrition essentials that maintain a healthy, vital immunity to cancer...what we put in our mouths either causes or directly contributes to the onset of cancer through the depression of our immunity\" (563). Possible treatment approaches for cancer based on her theory of cancer causation were discussed for the first time in a paper Livingston published in 1965 (977). In that paper, she reported treating 40 patients with a regimen that included an autogenous vaccine \u2014one made from each patient's culture of P. cryptocides. The vaccine was designed to promote the production of immunologic cells, to suppress the invading microorganism, and to promote host resistance. Other components of the treatment include laxatives, cleansing enemas, and a special diet low in carbohydrates and high in well-cooked proteins, fresh fruits, raw vegetables, and vitamin and mineral supplements. That paper described how the vaccine was made and administered to cancer patients, although clinical details about the patients, such as tumor type, previous treatment, or outcome, were not provided; it was noted only that, following vaccine treatment, \"a number of these patients appear to be improving.\" Livingston did not publish any other papers in the medical literature presenting data on tumor regression or life extension in cancer patients treated with her regimen. At present, other information about the treatment consists of the materials available from the Livingston-Wheeler Clinic (a patient brochure, a physician handbook, and a compendium of published research papers by Livingston and some of her colleagues), and two books written for a general audience (Cancer: A New Breakthrough (975) and The Conquest of Cancer (563)). The Conquest of Cancer contains case history summaries of patients treated at the clinic (see discussion below). Livingston stated in a deposition (559) that her treatment does not interfere with conventional treatment and can be used adjunctively (559). She stated in her book, however, that she preferred that patients avoid conventional treatment before starting her regimen, since, as she explained it, \"often they come to us after having been so heavily treated that their immune systems are all but destroyed, and their tumors are far advanced\" (563). Treatment Regimen The treatment regimen (as of July 1990, before Dr. Livingston's death) used at the clinic included a number of different immunologic, pharmacologic, and nutritional components. Before the 1990 \"cease and desist\" order was issued (see above), the autogenous vaccine was administered to all patients. The vaccine was intended to eliminate P. cryptocides from the body and was made from each patient's own culture of microorganisms, which were isolated from urine. In the initial treatment period, each patient was supplied with enough vaccine for 9 to 12 months. Thereafter, new cultures were obtained periodically for the production of new vaccines, so that the treatment continued to correspond to any changes in the patient's P. cryptocides levels as treatment progressed (559). Gradually, the frequency of autogenous vaccine administration was decreased and eventually, only occasional booster shots were given. Livingston also gave a \"purified antigen\" vaccine made at the clinic, consisting of a cell wall extract of a general P. cryptocides culture (562). Other immunologic treatments included in the regimen are mixed bacterial vaccines, antibiotics, and various commercially prepared nonspecific immune stimulators, such as levamisole (a conventional antiparasitic agent also used as an immune stimulant and recently shown effective in treating patients with colon cancer), and tuftsin (an experimental agent noted for various immune stimulating properties). The bacillus Calmette-Gu,rin (BCG) vaccine, a vaccine that immunizes against tuberculosis used as a general immunologic stimulant in some conventional cancer treatment, is also used in many cases. Other treatments are offered on a case by case basis. Progress in reducing infection with P. cryptocides is monitored by examining smears of a patient's blood under a darkfield microscope, an uncommon type of microscope that Livingston believed a key to identifying P. cryptocides microbes. A decrease or increase in the number of visible Progenitor cryptocides microbes in the blood smear is used to indicate increasing or decreasing immune response as a result of treatment. Other tests are also used to assess immune response and progress of treatment (563). Another component of the regimen is the provision of fresh, whole-blood transfusions from a young, healthy person (preferably a family member), and injections of gamma globulin to increase the number of circulating antibodies. Livingston also used a \"custom formula,\" consisting of an extract of sheep liver and spleen, to \"increase the white blood count [and] enhance immunogenic systems.\" Other immunologic agents that may be used include T-cells, thymosin (a hormone-like factor extracted from calf thymus), interferon, and tumor necrosis factor. Livingston recommended that patients follow specific nutritional guidelines. The recommended diet emphasizes \"living food\" \u2014 whole grains, fresh vegetables, and fruits. She strongly encouraged patients to stop smoking and to eliminate meat and poultry products, alcohol, coffee, refined sugars, and processed foods from their diets. Also included is a nutritional supplementation program, consisting of high doses of vitamins (especially vitamins A, B-6, B-12, and C), minerals, digestive enzymes, and bile salts. Another component of the regimen is bowel hygiene and detoxification. Livingston stated that frequent enemas, and sometimes high colonics, are necessary to cleanse the intestinal tract of pathogenic bacteria and toxic materials. She stated also that they help relieve pain and improve appetite and digestion. Daily coffee enemas may be recommended. In this regimen, emphasis is placed on the use of abscisic acid, a plant hormone (Dormin) and vitamin A analog that Livingston believed neutralizes chorionic gonadotropin in the blood and urine. She stated that abscisic acid is normally produced in the human liver, unless its function is impaired (561,976). This claim has apparently not been examined independently by researchers unaffiliated with Livingston. There have been no reports in the literature of direct adverse effects from the Livingston regimen. There are some potential risks, however. As with any injection into the body of a foreign substance, the injection of the autogenous vaccine carries the associated risk of sepsis or anaphylaxis. Some risk of contamination in the preparation of the material is also possible, depending on the processes and procedures used to make and assure the sterility of the vaccines manufactured at the clinic. In addition, in any setting, the use of whole blood transfusion, even with directed donors' blood, carries a small risk of transmitting various infectious agents. Livingston's \"custom formula,\" consisting of an extract of sheep liver and spleen, carries certain risks associated with all types of cellular treatment (see discussion of cellular treatment earlier in this chapter). Claims of Efficacy Livingston claimed that her treatment regimen is capable of curing cancer by stimulating the immune system. In support of this claim, she presented in her book, The Conquest of Cancer, a summary of clinical outcomes of patients treated at her clinic. According to Livingston, \"someone not employed by our clinic drew 100 charts from our files totally at random,\" which Livingston then evaluated. Sixty- two of these were considered evaluable by Livingston's criteria: she excluded patients whose records lacked confirmed pathology reports, who discontinued the Livingston-Wheeler treatment, who were \"too weak and ill to carry out the program,\" and \"who had only recently checked into the clinic, or whose cases were so recent that even the dramatically fast reversals could only be labeled inconclusive.\" Patients who received previous or concurrent conventional treatment were not excluded. Livingston concluded from her review that \"our success rate has been 82%\" and \"considering the patients we called inconclusive but for whom we were able to be of some help, it is over 90%,\" although there was no discussion of which cases were included in these percentages and for what reasons. She did not define what she meant by \"success\" or being of \"some help.\" Regarding the 18% that she did not consider successful, she stated that she \"probably could have helped these patients had they not come to us with enormously debilitated immune systems resulting from having already undergone massive chemotherapy and radiation.\" The conditions of some of the patients in this review may or may not have improved as a result of Livingston's treatment, but the data presented in her book on this group of self- selected patients do not support calculation of an overall \"success rate.\" Insufficient information is presented on the clinical course of these patients for readers to arrive at independent judgments about the treatment's usefulness and the complete, original patient data have not been examined by outside researchers. At present, there is insufficient information to indicate whether this regimen is or is not effective in treating cancer. However, Livingston's ideas have stimulated other researchers to study some aspects of her cancer treatment regimen. For example, Anthony Strelkauskas, M.D., at the University of South Carolina, is reportedly studying the immune responses of breast cancer patients to the autogenous vaccine, but results have not yet been published (559). A prospective clinical trial of the use of an autogenous vaccine in the treatment of cancer is currently underway in Virginia under the direction of Vincent Speckhart, M.D., and Alva Johnson, Ph.D. (819). The aim of the evaluation is to observe tumor responses following vaccine administration among 33 patients described as having advanced forms of cancer and as either failing previous treatment or having recurrences following conventional treatment. For a six- month period, patients were given regular doses of an autogenous vaccine prepared from cultures of chorionic gonadotropin-producing bacteria isolated from the patients' urine (820). According to a summary of preliminary results (a full description is not yet available), the study found several cases of tumor regression, some complete and some partial, in this group of patients. No adverse reactions, except localized redness and an occasional rash that were resolved by changing the vaccine dose, were noted. Speckhart and Johnson's full results may contribute information to the further evaluation of the efficacy of such vaccines in cancer treatment. Hans Nieper Another widely known practitioner of unconventional cancer treatment is Hans Nieper, MD, a West German physician. Patients from many countries, including the United States, reportedly have sought his treatment. Nieper specializes in the treatment of cancer, multiple sclerosis, and heart disease (77). For cancer, Nieper prescribes a combination of conventional and unconventional agents (including pharmaceutical drugs, vitamins, minerals, and animal and plant extracts), and recommends that patients follow a special diet and avoid particular physical agents, foods, and physical locations (\"geopathogenic zones\") that he believes are damaging. [Note: In 1994, [the FDA banned importation of Nieper products](http://www.fda.gov/ora/fiars/ora_import_ia6628.html). Nieper died on October 21, 1998.] Since 1964, Nieper has been affiliated with the Paracelsus Silbersee Hospital in Hannover, West Germany. He received his MD from the University of Hamburg in 1953 (77). In addition to his medical practice and clinical research, Nieper hypothesizes about some aspects of theoretical physics. His writings cover subjects such as the \"shielding theory of gravity\" and the potential for harnessing useful energy from space, which he refers to as the \"tachyon field.\" Some of his ideas about problems in medicine, including some aspects of cancer etiology and treatment, are based on his theories of energy fields (677). Nieper has published a large number of papers and books on medical subjects, in several languages, according to information from the Admiral Ruge Archives, A. Keith Brewer Science Library, Richland Center, Wisconsin, a private library that collects and distributes some of Nieper's papers in the United States. These papers, some of which are translated from German, are distributed by that library as mimeographed typescripts, with a title, Nieper's name as author, and a date; although in all but a few papers, no source or citation is given to indicate whether they correspond to published articles. Using indexes to the open medical literature accessible in the United States (e.g., Index Medicus and Science Citation Index), OTA found citations to a small number of articles by Nieper, only a few in English (675). In 1985, an English translation of his book Revolution in Technology, Medicine and Society was published (677). This book contains discussions (often difficult to follow) of his theories and research interests (titled, e.g., \"On the Subject of Medicine and the Tachyon Era,\" \"The Symposium on Energy Technology in Hannover,\" \"Congress on Gravity Field Energy in Toronto,\" \"Epilog for the Hannover and Toronto Energy Conferences,\" and \"Encouraging signs in Politics, Economy, and Intellectual Leadership\"). Within the context of these subjects, Nieper discusses approaches to the treatment of cancer, multiple sclerosis, thrombosis, arteriosclerosis, lupus, asthma, heart disease, and a variety of other conditions. Nieper's book and mimeographed papers cover a range of issues in cancer prevention and treatment and also discuss particular treatments that he believes are important. Although he states that his ideas are based on clinical and laboratory data, he does not explain them in the context of other available medical literature. Rather, he discusses his approaches to treatment in the context of theories and conclusions derived from his general knowledge of medical research. The lack of straightforward descriptions of his treatment approaches and of citations to existing medical literature make it difficult, at best, to determine the components of his treatment regimens and the specific information (including his data and others') on which they are based. Nieper offers additional information about his treatments in the course of occasional seminars and workshops in the United States, which are sponsored by the Hans Nieper Foundation, an information and support group based in California and directed by a former patient. At a 1987 full day seminar for medical professionals, held in New York, Nieper discussed his protocols for the treatment of cancer and multiple sclerosis (453), for example. There is virtually no other available information intended for a U.S. audience on Nieper's treatment regimens from Nieper or his supporters. Thus far, government and private organizations in the United States have not provided synopses of Nieper's treatment, as has been done for a variety of other unconventional cancer treatments that U.S. cancer patients use. No written statements about Nieper are available from the Cancer Information Service (NCI) or the Committee on Unproven Methods (ACS). One aspect of Nieper's treatment was addressed in a 1986 FDA \"talk paper\" (890) on the issue of importation of Nieper's treatment materials. In 1987, FDA issued an import alert (891), announcing that shipments of drugs prescribed by Nieper would be detained by U.S. Customs agents. FDA considers the shipment of these drugs into the United States to be in violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, since they lack U.S. approval for use and are not labeled according to standards set forth in that law. Based on the book and mimeographed papers referred to above, some aspects of Nieper's treatment for cancer can be described. Nieper describes his approach to treatment as \"eumetabolic,\" a term he coined to refer to the use of substances derived from plants or animals that he considers not to be \"foreign\" in the human body. The regimen for cancer includes \"subtoxic doses of chemotherapy,\" \"hormone therapy,\" and \"gene-repair therapy;\" the components and rationale for them are only indirectly and partially described. The overall aim of the cancer treatment regimen is to activate the \"internal defense system,\" which Nieper believes is the body's own mechanism for fighting cancer. He uses low-dose chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to kill or remove tumor cells directly, but cautions that chemotherapy \"must never be so extensive that valuable mechanisms of the body's own defenses are thoughtlessly damaged\" (677). Nieper believes that internal mechanisms control the healing process in cancer; \"exogenous factors and procedures have, therefore, little effect on...the incidence...and the curing rate\" (676). Nieper believes that cancer is caused by suppression of natural host defenses, by overeating the wrong types of foods, and by exposure to certain types of environmental factors. He refers to particular environmental factors that he believes lead to \"gene instabilities\" and to the activation of oncogenes: X- rays, ultraviolet radiation, alternating current electrical fields, and the \"tachyon field turbulence of the geopathic zone.\" In Nieper's view, geopathic zones \"play a decisive role in the development of cancer cells and cancerous tumors\" (677), in that he believes there is a higher incidence of cancer in areas of high levels of earth radiation and in areas situated over subterranean water veins. He believes that geopathic zones cause disturbances in the magnetic or electrostatic properties of tissues in the body, which disrupt the genetic material. Nieper claims that 92% of cancer cases he has examined are associated with long- term occupancy (particularly where the individuals sleep) of geopathic zones. He believes that \"removal of cancer- stricken patients from geopathic zones absolutely belongs to the conscientious duties of an oncologist\" (677). Nieper states that his treatment regimen is \"more or less the same in all conditions of malignancy whatever the finding\" (673). A wide range of substances used to treat cancer patients is discussed in his writings, including dehydroepiandrosterone, magnesium, selenium, beta carotene, bromelaine (papain), cod liver shark's liver oil) (676). In addition to prescribing some or all of these agents, Nieper cautions patients to avoid alternating current fields, such as electric blankets and heating pads, and to avoid all cigarette smoke. He recommends that they follow a special diet \u2014a low-salt, low-carbohydrate, \"Kirlian- positive vegetarian diet,\" including whole grain cereals and breads, carrot juice with heavy cream, vegetable and fruit juices, low-fat milk, all types of vegetables and fruits, moderate amounts of coffee, tea, eggs, and butter, and limited amounts of fish. Patients are cautioned to avoid most types of meat, sausage, chicken, veal, shellfish, sugar, alcohol (except \"sour\" wine), white bread, cheese, vitamin B12, and iron (167). The information available about Nieper's treatment regimen contains very little clinical data on outcomes in cancer patients following treatment. A mimeographed paper dated 1977 and a 1980 paper with the same information show a table listing 23 general tumor types found in 214 patients, along with the number of patients with each tumor type and the number of \"positive responses\" to his treatment. A \"positive response\" was defined as \"18-month survival with considerably improved health.\" Nieper claims that \"the percentage of patients whose disease gets under control within an 18-month period of observation is close to 40%\" but he restricts this to \"mobile, so-called incurable patients,\" because \"the results with hospitalized patients are less than half as good since hospitalization indicates that the disease has progressed too far\" (674,675). Since no data are given on tumor stage, prior treatment, specific treatments given to patients under his regimen, or how these particular patients were chosen for inclusion in the analysis, the information provided is insufficient to draw any conclusions about efficacy. Oxygen Treatments Various types of oxidizing agents are discussed in the popular literature on unconventional cancer treatments and at meetings sponsored by advocacy and information groups such as the Cancer Control Society (162). Although not apparently widespread in the United States, the use of oxidizing agents has been reported at clinics in Mexico and West Germany where U.S. cancer patients are treated (289,588). The most commonly mentioned treatments of this type are ozone (a gas), hydrogen peroxide (a liquid), antioxidant enzymes, and related products (853). Oxidizing agents such as ozone and hydrogen peroxide are commonly available and have a variety of mainstream uses: as antiseptic, disinfectant, and cleansing agents, as laboratory chemical reagents, and in the food packaging industry. In addition to their use in unconventional cancer treatments, oxidizing agents are also proposed as components of unconventional treatments for AIDS, cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and a variety of other conditions (96,297). The late Otto Warburg, a German chemist twice awarded the Nobel Prize, was one of the first to discuss an association between oxygen levels in the body and the etiology of cancer, and to suggest that the growth of cancer cells is favored by an intracellular environment low in oxygen (936). Many others have since expanded on Warburg's ideas, and much has been written about oxygen treatments in general. Not only is there no accepted rationale for the proposed effects of oxidizing agents in cancer treatment among current proponents, but disputes among oxygen proponents are found in descriptions of these treatments in the unconventional literature (80,217). The role of oxygen compounds in the initiation and progression of cancer has long been a subject of mainstream scientific study. In general, active oxygen is thought to contribute in a variety of ways to the development of malignant cells (180). Ozone can be administered by direct infusion of the gaseous mixture into the rectum or into muscle, but it is usually given by unconventional practitioners in blood infusion, a process whereby blood is removed, treated with oxygen, and returned to the body, as explained in a recent review by an unconventional medicine advocate: The ozone is produced by forcing oxygen through a metal tube carrying a 300-volt charge. A pint of blood is drawn from the patient and placed in an infusion bottle. The ozone is then forced into the bottle and mixed in by shaking gently, whereupon the blood turns bright cardinal red. As the ozone molecules dissolve into the blood they give up their third oxygen atom, releasing considerable energy which destroys all lipid-envelope virus, and apparently most other disease organisms as well, while leaving blood cells unharmed (297). Medizone International, a company that manufactures a device used to deliver ozone by infusion in the blood system, has filed an investigational new drug application with FDA to study the possible use of ozone as an antiviral agent. Before phase I studies in humans can proceed under the IND, however, the company is required to submit data, probably involving tests in animals using a range of doses, showing that ozone can be administered safely. Little information in the published, peer-reviewed literature is available on the use of ozone in general in the treatment of cancer, or on the recommended doses and regimen for treatment. Claims for the efficacy of ozone are based on a number of papers and case reports of its use on cancer patients (926,929), in animal studies (52,586), and in cell culture (940). One paper by Sweet and colleagues, published in Science, presents indirect evidence that atmospheric ozone selectively inhibits the growth of human tumor cells in cell culture (in vitro) (846). Hydrogen peroxide is given in dilute form by various routes \u2014 oral, rectal, intravenous, vaginal, and in bathing. Proponents state that hydrogen peroxide oxidizes toxins, kills bacteria and viruses, and stimulates immunity (364). One unconventional practitioner, Kurt Donsbach, who treats cancer patients in Tijuana, formulated a line of products using hydrogen peroxide, including ear drops, nasal spray, and tooth gel. Donsbach states that every cancer patient at his clinic in Tijuana receives dilute \"infusions of the 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide throughout their entire stay\" (262). In 1988, the U.S. Postal Service issued Donsbach a cease and desist order to stop him from claiming that the hydrogen peroxide used orally or intravenously is effective against cancer or arthritis, or that it is fit for human consumption (69). Another clinic, the Gerson clinic in Tijuana, has recently added ozone therapy to their regimen, partly on the basis of the laboratory study by Sweet and colleagues referred to above (401). Patients at the Gerson clinic are commonly given ozone enemas, consisting of 500 to 1000 cc of ozone given rectally in less than one minute (318). Another form of oxygen treatment, superoxide dismutase, is an antioxidant enzyme believed to play a role in aerobic metabolism (689). Several unconventional treatment facilities in Tijuana, e.g., the Manner Clinic and American Biologics Hospital and Medical Center, reported using this enzyme in their regimens for cancer patients (22,574). Oxidizing agents, such as ozone and hydrogen peroxide, can destroy cells, including those of the blood-forming organs, and at some doses, can be seriously damaging or even lethal (860). The doses at which these agents can be administered safely have not yet been determined. Although advocates of ozone and hydrogen peroxide maintain that these substances can be used safely, other unconventional practitioners have noted possible adverse effects (98). Emanuel Revici and \"Biologically Guided Chemotherapy\" Emanuel Revici, M.D., is a physician in his nineties who currently practices in New York City. During a career spanning seven decades and four countries, Revici has developed an apparently unique approach to the treatment of cancer and a wide range of other disorders, including AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, chronic pain, radiation injury, schizophrenia, drug addiction, and others (597,747,748). Revici proposes that the clinical manifestations of cancer are associated with an imbalance of two general classes of lipids (fatty acids and sterols) in the body and in some cases also with the presence of particular lipid constituents (conjugated fatty acids). Using a test system he developed to measure certain physiologic changes that he believes reflect these lipid imbalances, Revici treats patients he identifies as having a predominance of one or the other class of lipid with one or more lipid-based pharmacologic agents intended to counteract the imbalance (741). Revici characterizes his regimen as a \"dualistic\" approach to cancer chemotherapy (747), referring to his proposal that different and opposing groups of agents, rather than a single type operating by one mode of action, may be required to treat cancer. Revici received his medical degree in 1920 from the University of Bucharest, Romania, where he later worked as assistant professor in internal medicine. He practiced medicine and conducted clinical research in Paris (1936-41) and in Mexico City (1941-46) before settling in New York, where in 1946 he established the Institute of Applied Biology. Since 1947, Revici has maintained a private practice in New York. He also served as chief of oncology (1955-65) and as consultant (1965-78) at Trafalgar Hospital, formerly the Beth David Hospital, a New York facility purchased by Revici's fundraising organization (212,213). A recent review of Revici's career characterized that hospital as a general care facility employing over 200 resident and visiting physicians, and noted that it contained animal research laboratories staffed by 35 scientists and technicians, \"all involved in projects inspired by or related to Revici's theories and therapeutic method\" (212). Trafalgar Hospital closed in 1978, reportedly because of financial difficulties (211). In 1949, the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry published an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (J.A.M.A.) warning against Revici's treatment, among other unconventional treatments (39). In a letter to the editor, the AMA article was criticized for disparaging Revici with unwarranted accusations about his work (738). The J.A.M.A. article was reportedly reprinted and distributed by the ACS's Brooklyn Cancer Committee, which Revici later sued for libel. The case was eventually settled out of court through mediation by the Medical Society of the State of New York (740). The ACS Committee on Unproven Methods of Cancer Management published its first statement on Revici's treatment in 1961 (22a). Since 1984, Revici has faced legal challenge regarding his license to practice medicine in New York State; he is currently on probation for a 5-year period that began in October 1988. Two malpractice suits charging medical negligence have also been filed against him in Federal court since 1983 (see ch. 11 for details). The main source of information available about Revici's treatment is his book, published in 1961, entitled Research in Physiopathology as a Basis of Guided Chemotherapy with Special Application to Cancer (747), which focuses on the theoretical basis for his approach. In it, he argues that \"cancer \u2014as well as other conditions \u2014 can be integrated into a hierarchic concept of organization which applies throughout nature.\" According to his theory, that organization is determined by certain laws, among them the law of dualism, or opposing forces, at every level. He discusses his views of the activity of organic and inorganic substances in relation to: the level of organization in the body at which they act (nuclear, cellular, organ, etc.); their \"dualistic nature\"; other substances in the body (particularly lipids); and how they affect the body's defense mechanism (747). Revici believes that this dualism affects one's physiologic state and is key to understanding how disease may develop and how it may be treated. Revici describes his treatment for cancer \u2014which he refers to as \"biologically guided chemotherapy\" \u2014as nontoxic, individually guided chemotherapy using lipid and lipid-based substances (210). He believes that tumor cells, as well as other types of abnormal cells, share a common biochemical characteristic \u2014an imbalance in the normal distribution of lipids \u2014which he views not as the primary cause of cancer, but as the direct cause of its impact on the body's metabolism. He categorizes two general patterns of local and systemic effects of lipid imbalances reportedly found by him in patients with cancer, one pattern resulting from an excess of fatty acids and the other pattern resulting from an excess of sterols. According to Revici's analysis, a relative predominance of fatty acids leads to an electrolyte imbalance, specifically an increase in sodium in the extracellular fluids, and an alkaline environment in tumor tissues; Revici refers to this as a \"catabolic\" condition. In the opposite case, a predominance of sterols reportedly leads to a reduction in cell membrane permeability and an inhibition of the cells' oxidative processes, which in turn reduces the availability of intracellular oxygen, interferes with the breakdown of carbohydrates, and results in excess lactic acid in the extracellular fluids; Revici refers to this outcome as an \"anabolic\" condition. [Anabolic and catabolic are terms referring to the body's metabolism. In usual usage, anabolic metabolism corresponds to the constructive synthesis of macromolecules, whereas catabolic refers to the breakdown of complex materials in the body and the release of energy.] Patients determined by Revici to have a predominance of fatty acids are treated with sterols and other agents with positive electrical charges that can to with the negatively charged fatty acids. Those determined to have a predominance of sterols are treated with fatty acids and other agents that increase the metabolic activity of fatty acids (513,741,749). A physician who worked closely with Revici from 1946 until 1957 noted in a summary of Revici's approach that \"since the lipid imbalances appear to play an important role in determining the metabolic, local and systemic features of the disease,\" the treatment regimen is intended to modify those features by administering substances that influence the lipid imbalance. Some of Revici's research efforts focused on developing chemical agents capable of modifying lipid imbalances and on developing tests to identify and measure the balance of lipid in individual patients (741). Revici has some support for various aspects of his theoretical approach among a small group of researchers. In a recently published paper, Harold Ladas reviewed Revici's work with selenium compounds in the treatment of cancer (513). In a recent unpublished manuscript, Leonard Kunst, Harold Ladas, and Frederick van Kampen reviewed some aspects of Revici's theory in the context of current knowledge about the role of lipids in the cancer process, and suggested that lipid substances such as those Revici uses may act by targeting and potentiating the action of antitumor agents at the tumor site (494). In another unpublished manuscript, Kunst and Ladas reviewed Revici's proposal regarding biochemical changes in lipids associated with radiation exposure and the use of n-butanol to treat radiation injury (492). A third unpublished paper by Kunst and Ladas examined Revici's ideas concerning correlations between the molecular charge and biological activity of certain types of molecules (493). In a 1985 Institute of Applied Biology publication, one of Revici's medical associates, Dwight McKee, described many aspects of Revici's current theoretical approach to treating a wide variety of conditions (597). Thus far, however, there has been no comprehensive review in the mainstream medical literature of Revici's theory and its application to cancer treatment. Revici's treatment regimen has apparently not been adopted or continued by other practitioners outside of his institute, either in the context of conventional clinical studies or unconventional practice, so at present, Revici's New York office is the only site where the treatment is used. For several years in the 1960s, however, some of Revici's treatment agents were reportedly used in Belgium by the late Joseph Maisin, who at that time was Director of the Cancer Institute of the University of Louvain and President of the International Union Against Cancer. According to several letters written to Revici between 1965 and 1970 (573), Maisin obtained a number of compounds from Revici (including \"CMS,\" \"MHS,\" \"MHSe5,\" and \"anti-MHSe\") and treated patients generally described as those with advanced metastatic cancer who had failed previous treatment. Some patients were treated with a combination of Revici's agents and radiotherapy, while others were given Revici's agents alone. These letters do not describe the conditions under which the patients were treated, e.g., as part of a formal evaluation or on an informal basis, or how particular agents were chosen for particular patients. The letters were apparently written to inform Revici of Maisin's clinical observations, and included brief summaries of some cases considered to have responded well to the treatment. Maisin noted that some patients experienced tumor regressions, disappearance of metastases, and improved functional status following treatment. Maisin died in 1970 and no further information about Maisin's experience with Revici's treatment is available. Earlier in his career, Revici published papers in South American and European scientific journals (31). Since the 1950s (751,961), however, Revici has not published updated descriptions or studies of his cancer treatment in the peer- reviewed scientific literature (although attempts were reportedly made to do so (739,836)). The most recent openly available description of his cancer treatment regimen written by Revici is his 1961 book, referred to above, which provides some information from laboratory experiments and clinical experience (including case histories of patients treated with his method) supporting his theoretical approach. The book does not, however, provide details of the empirical basis for classifying cancer patients' metabolic conditions or for choosing specific treatment agents according to that system of classification. At present, Revici and his associates appear to be the only ones who know how to interpret and apply his diagnostic and treatment protocols, since the protocols are, at least to some extent, proprietary and cannot be deduced from his book. In the absence of up-to-date descriptions of the rationale and process of his treatment regimen, it may be difficult, if not impossible, for Revici's treatment to be continued in the future without his personal involvement. Revici's Cancer Treatment Regimen In order to determine whether a patient's condition is anabolic or catabolic, Revici tests for certain characteristics (specific gravity, pH, and surface tension) of the patient's urine before treatment is initiated. Revici believes that these indices, while not diagnostic of cancer, reflect systemic changes in the body produced by lipid imbalances (513,741). As treatment progresses, the urine is reexamined periodically to determine whether and by how much these indices change. A sterol predominant or anabolic condition is considered to be indicated by urine that is alkaline (pH greater than 6.0 to 6.2), has a high surface tension (above 68 dynes/cm2), and has a low specific gravity. Patients whose urine measures below 6.0 to 6.2 in pH and below 68 dynes/cm2 in surface tension are considered to be catabolic, or fatty acid predominant (741). Revici reportedly believes that, in healthy individuals, these urine indices tend to fluctuate up and down over a narrow range around median values \u2014pH of 6.0 to 6.2 and surface tension of 68 dynes/cm2 \u2014while cancer patients tend to show values fixed at either higher or lower levels (741). Progress of treatment is measured by the degree to which it alters these urine indices toward normal values. Revici asks his patients to monitor these changes at home using a colorimeter to indicate urine pH. Urinary surface tension is measured using a glass \"urotensiometer\" (747), a device designed for Revici's use. Other urine indices reportedly used in Revici's classification method include specific gravity and a chloride index (the ratio between specific gravity and chloride concentration) (748). The urine indices that Revici uses as diagnostic and treatment tools are not used in this way in mainstream medicine; they are not diagnostic of the presence of cancer or its systemic effects and have wide natural variations depending, for example, on fluid intake and ingestion of acid or alkaline foods or other substances. Revici's 1961 book and some of his articles discuss the use of these urine indices, but do not offer evidence validating their reliable use in identifying metabolic abnormalities, or confirming that such metabolic abnormalities actually exist among patients. In support of his conclusions about these tests and their clinical significance, Revici refers to laboratory experiments and clinical studies conducted under his direction at the Institute of Applied Biology over many years, the bulk of which have apparently not been reported, critiqued, or confirmed externally. Revici uses the Periodic Table of Elements as one of several guides to deciding on treatment regimens for his patients. Based on his study of the organization of elements in the Periodic Table, he believes that the periods (horizontal rows) indicate at which level of biological organization in the body a particular element acts \u2014at the level of subnuclear particles, the nucleus, the cell, the tissue, or the whole body. He also believes that the placement of elements in particular series (columns) determines whether they act anabolically or catabolically in the body (749). For example, he considers elements in group VIA \u2014oxygen, sulfur, selenium, and tellurium \u2014active against a chronically anabolic state (513). According to Revici and several others writing about Revici's treatment, a wide variety of chemical agents has been used in his regimen. Revici recently stated that most of the substances he uses as treatments for cancer are either \"twin formations\" (reportedly defined as two adjacent carbon atoms having the same induced electrical charge (493)) or inorganic elements (e.g., iron, magnesium, copper, or selenium) incorporated in or bound to lipids (749), but he did not say which specific substances are in current use in his practice. Since the 1940s, one of the agents Revici has frequently used to treat patients classified as having a sterol predominance is lipid-bound selenium. Revici reportedly has used preparations of \"T Sel\" (selenium (513), and hexyldiselenide (741). Other substances used to treat this classification of patients include: fatty acids (including some isolated from human and animal sources), sulfur compounds (e.g., colloidal sulfur, sodium thiosulfate), hydrines (e.g., epichlorohydrin), aldehydes, male hormones (testosterone), and mustard compounds (513). Substances Revici has reported using to treat patients classified as catabolic or fatty acid predominant derivatives, metals (mercury, iron, bismuth), and halogens (e.g., iodine) (747). The treatment agents are given orally or by injection (210). Revici's technicians prepare the treatment agents according to Revici's formulas and instructions (213). To OTA's knowledge, these treatment agents have not been analyzed independently. According to a 1989 statement on Revici by the American Cancer Society, Revici was issued 17 U.S. patents between 1981 and 1988 for chemical formulations described for use against cancer, viral diseases, and substance abuse, and for termination of pregnancy (31). While selenium compounds can generally be toxic (197), Revici reportedly believes that he has identified a form of selenium that is nontoxic to patients (the \"negative bivalent form\") (213). He believes that treatment can cause inflammation around the area of the tumor, causing it to become more painful and to become larger and softer, before causing it to shrink and disappear (513). No adverse effects from Revici's treatment have been reported in the medical literature. Claims Revici states in his book that his treatment \"when correctly applied...can, in many cases, bring under control even far- advanced malignancies\" (747). In support of this, he presents many case histories of cancer patients with partial or complete remissions following his treatment. The recent transcripts of a congressional hearing held in New York also contain numerous presentations by and on behalf of Revici's cancer patients claiming remissions as a result of his treatment (749). Revici concludes his 1961 book by noting: The results obtained and especially their high proportion, even in far advanced cases, permits a fair judgment of the place of the present form of application of this method in the fight against cancer. Based on these results, we are fully entitled to consider it, not only a highly beneficial treatment which can be offered now for this disease, but even a major step nearer to the solution of the problem of the therapy of cancer (747). Attempts at Evaluating the Revici Treatment Regimen In 1978, two compounds containing selenium that Revici has used \u2014amyl selenide and selenium diethyldithiocarbamate (\"Secar\") \u2014 were submitted on Revici's behalf to the Drug Therapeutics Program, NCI, for testing of antitumor activity in an animal tumor screening test (1). One of the compounds, amyl selenide, showed antitumor activity in the mouse P388 Leukemia test system (905). The other compound, selenium diethyldithiocarbamate, showed no antitumor activity in this test (905). Although agents that test positive in prescreen are usually tested further in NCI's tumor panel, amyl selenide was not submitted for further testing. Another compound, trithioformaldehyde, was said by Revici supporters to have been tested in experimental animals at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in the late 1970s (212,652), but the Institute has no records to confirm such tests or their results (754). More recently, another selenium compound that Revici reportedly uses was tested in several other animal tumor systems. According to a letter from a British company (Advisory Services, Ltd., London), the diheptyl diselenide was reportedly tested at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund and Westminster Hospital, London, on a variety of tumor systems, and was found to be active in four of them (L1210 leukemia, Lewis lung metastases, M5076 liver metastases, and early S180 tumor growth). Acute and chronic toxicity of the compound was also studied, and it was found that the dose at which antitumor activity was found was \"fairly close to the toxic dose\" (484). Further studies on the compound were recommended \"to determine more precisely the nature of the activity and to see if we can obtain significant anti-tumor activity without, at the same time, inducing undue toxic reactions\" (484). As a means of presenting Revici's overall clinical experience in cancer treatment, a descriptive study of clinical outcomes in all the cancer patients treated with the Revici regimen between 1946 and 1955 was summarized in an unpublished paper (741). The paper was written by Robert Ravich, M.D., who worked closely with Revici at the Institute of Applied Biology and who, with Revici, treated the patients described in the report. Most of the patients were reported as \"far advanced' or \"terminal\" and had had previous treatment (e.g., surgery, radiation, hormones, and nitrogen mustard). Cases included in the report were limited to those whose diagnosis of cancer was \"clearly established by the best available means, by qualified physicians, surgeons and pathologists not connected with the Institute of Applied Biology\" but otherwise were not selectively included or excluded, since the report was intended to describe the entire population of patients treated by Revici during that time. The 1,047 patients were classified as either fatty acid or sterol predominant, according to Revici's diagnostic testing (based mainly on urine analyses of pH and surface tension, as described above). Of the patients found to have a sterol predominance, 152 were treated with sodium thiosulfate and sulfurized oil; 95 with sulfhydryl methylthioglycholate, and dimercaprol); 78 with fatty acid mixtures extracted from various natural sources including human placenta, and animal and fish organs; 64 with conjugated or alpha-hydroxy fatty acids; and 53 with hexyldiselenide. Of the patients found to have a fatty acid predominance, 106 were treated with n-butanol; 77 with glycerin, 51 with cholesterol or other non-saponifiable lipids extracted from unspecified organs; and 10 with octanol. Treatment agents given to the remaining 361 patients were not specified. Individual determinations of dose were made on the basis of each patient's urine analyses and it was noted that no toxic reactions were observed. Treatments were given orally and by injection. Both objective and subjective outcomes were recorded. A favorable objective response was defined as measurable \"reductions in size and extent of the disease as visualized either directly by the eye or by X-ray, or by palpation\" that were \"sustained for a significant period of time and in the direction of improvement over several successive observation intervals.\" However, in some cases, stabilization of disease \"over long intervals\" was also considered an objective response. A favorable subjective response was defined as \"satisfactory improvement for a sustained period as reported by the patient,\" usually referring to relief from pain, a sense of wellbeing, and increased energy, strength, and appetite. Of the 1,047 cases reviewed, 100 were judged to have had favorable objective and subjective responses; 11 had objective responses only; and 95 had subjective responses only. These cases included 23 different types of primary cancers. Two hundred ninety-six patients were judged to have had no response, subjective or objective, and 545 patients had equivocal or undetermined responses (380 of this latter group were treated less than three months). Details of the individual cases were not given in the report. To date, the only published clinical study of Revici's treatment for cancer is a paper that appeared in J.A.M.A. in 1965 written by the \"Clinical Appraisal Group\" (CAG), a group of nine New York physicians assembled specifically for that study (571). According to the report, the study was done at the request of the Board of Trustees of Revici's Trafalgar Hospital. It evaluated the clinical course and outcomes of selected cancer patients who were referred to Revici for treatment. The authors reported that they did not influence or modify the treatment Revici offered to these patients during the study. All of these patients were considered refractory to conventional treatment. Other criteria were that only hormone-independent (571), solid tumors, certified by tissue diagnosis, were included. Excluded from the study were tumor types that were not expected to progress in a short period of time and patients who had recently undergone conventional therapy. Thirty- three cancer patients were ultimately included in the study. The authors reported that 22 of the 33 patients died of cancer or its complications while on the Revici treatment. Eight other patients left the study group \"in unimproved condition\" after some time on the regimen. Four of these eight patients later died of cancer, two of them went elsewhere for palliative treatment, and two were lost to followup. The three remaining patients were under Revici's care at the close of the study period and all of these were reported to have shown signs of tumor progression. The study group concluded that none of these 33 patients Revici treated showed signs of objective tumor regression. The group concluded that \"the Revici method of treatment of cancer is without value\" (571). Apparently responding to a full version of the report (a two page summary of which became the published J.A.M.A. version), Revici wrote a detailed statement sharply criticizing the CAG's methods, conduct, and interpretations (750). He also presented summaries of patient records that he claimed showed objective responses to treatment, contradicting the CAG's interpretation of the same data. He noted, among other things, that several patients in the study had tumor remissions that the study group allegedly failed to recognize. Revici also noted that it was he, rather than the Board of Directors of the Trafalgar Hospital, who requested the study in the \"hope that the demonstration of positive results in even a few of these advanced cases would excite sufficient interest to lead to a large scale study of our approach.\" He particularly criticized the overall conclusion stated in the full version of the report (that \"the Revici method of treatment of cancer...should be abandoned.\"), he wrote: In the event that this method should have proven ineffective in the types of cancer accepted (in the analysis), and not a single reduction in the size of any tumor noted, these should have been the only conclusions that could have been rightfully drawn. To conclude from a limited study, such as this, that the method should be discontinued, in all cancers, is to say that since surgery and radiation have failed in these same terminal patients, these \"recognized\" methods should also be discontinued, not only in these types of cancer but in all cancers in general. (emphasis in original) Recently, Seymour Brenner, M.D., a radiologist in private practice in New York, took initial steps toward documenting and verifying the medical records of ten patients treated by Revici. In presenting summaries of these cases at the March 1990 meeting of the Advisory Panel for the present OTA study, Brenner stated that he believed these ten patients to be examples of successful treatment with Revici's method, citing evidence of tumor regression, improved quality of life, and enhanced survival. These case histories have not yet been subjected to critical review. No prospective controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Revici's treatment has been conducted. Vitamin C Vitamin C (ascorbic acid or ascorbate) may be discussed more frequently in connection with the common cold, but its use in the treatment and palliation of cancer has also been promoted and widely adopted; thousands of U.S. cancer patients are believed to take large doses of vitamin C (756). The proponents most closely associated with the study and use of vitamin C for cancer treatment are the Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, PhD, whose advocacy, expressed in books, articles, and personal appearances publicized by the media, has been primarily responsible for popularizing vitamin C for cancer, and his colleague Ewan Cameron, M.B., Ch.B., a Scottish surgeon. Treatment with vitamin C is generally promoted as an adjunct to conventional cancer treatment, with the aim, according to Cameron and Pauling, of supporting the patient's natural defenses against the disease \u2014e.g., to support encapsulation of the tumor, to resist the formation of metastases, to enhance immunologic competence, to reduce cachexia, and to improve general health status (158). Although it is an essential nutrient, vitamin C cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be derived from the diet or from supplements, which can be prepared synthetically or extracted from fruits and vegetables. Relatively small amounts of vitamin C in the diet are needed to avoid overt deficiency diseases such as scurvy. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin C is 45 milligrams (0.045 grams) per day (661a). Its use in unconventional cancer treatment usually involves megadoses (usually 10 grams per day or more) of vitamin C, administered intravenously or orally (dissolved in water or juice or as capsules). Dosages are adjusted to each patient, but in general, they usually begin with one to two grams daily and increase gradually to ten grams or more per day. The tolerance level is reached when the patient experiences the vitamin's laxative effects (when taken orally), and dosage is then reduced and maintained at a slightly lower level (557). Proponents state that they do not know the best dose in cancer patients, but generally assume it to be about 10 grams per day, which is \"as much ascorbate as the patient can tolerate without gastrointestinal side effects\" (158). The idea of using vitamin C in cancer treatment was first proposed in the early 1970s by Cameron. Cameron examined the process of uncontrolled invasiveness in tumor growth, and looked for ways to inhibit cancer cells from infiltrating and damaging surrounding normal tissue and from metastasizing to distant organs. He focused on the possible role of an enzyme, hyaluronidase, in supporting tumor invasiveness, and suggested that manipulation of an inhibitor of this enzyme, which existed in the blood, could be used to control the process (151). In the early 1970s, Cameron and his colleague Douglas Rotman noted that the inhibitor molecule they were examining contained an ascorbate component. They hypothesized that increasing the supply of ascorbate in the blood might increase the production or action of the hyaluronidase inhibitor, and thereby restrain the invasion of tumor cells into normal tissue (160). Linus Pauling, working in California, considered a possible role for vitamin C in cancer treatment. He focused on the role of collagen in the process of tumor invasiveness, and noted that vitamin C was required for the synthesis of collagen (158). Cameron and Pauling, collaborating in their research, suggested that increasing the intake of vitamin C would stimulate the synthesis of more collagen fibrils and thereby strengthen it, which in turn would help restrain malignant cells from invading surrounding tissue and increase the body's natural resistance to cancer (155). They later reported that a deficiency of vitamin C was associated with a weaker intercellular matrix, and suggested that malignant cells could more easily infiltrate local tissue and metastasize to distant sites as a result (159). Cameron began administering high dose vitamin C intravenously to some of his most advanced cancer patients at the Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch Lomonside, Scotland, in 1971. He reported that \"the majority had gained a respite period of relative well-being, comfort, and dignity\" despite eventually succumbing to their disease (153). In 1974, Cameron and a colleague reported tumor regressions and subjective benefits in cancer patients treated with high- dose vitamin C (154). He and Pauling reported enhanced survival and improved well-being (improved appetite, increased mental alertness, decreased need for pain relievers, etc.) among patients who took high-dose vitamin C (156,157) (see discussion below for details of these studies). Cameron and Pauling's advocacy of the use of vitamin C in cancer patients sets them apart from mainstream medicine, but they are by no means alone in research into the biochemical and physiologic effects of ascorbate in experimental systems. During the 1980s in particular, a wide range of experimental studies supporting a biological rationale for considering the role of ascorbate in cancer processes was conducted and reported in the literature. Many of the studies focus on the role of vitamin C in preventing the development of cancer, e.g., epidemiologic studies examining associations between consumption of foods containing vitamin C with cancer incidence, reviewed and summarized in the recent National Research Council (NRC) document Diet and Health (661). That document also reviewed experimental evidence concerning the role of ascorbic acid in preventing the formation of certain carcinogens in the body and in enhancing cellular immunity. In addition, studies have examined the effect of ascorbate in animal tumor models, which have produced positive, though somewhat variable, results (342). Claims Cameron and Pauling state that high doses of vitamin C are \"helpful to virtually every cancer patient and can be dramatically beneficial to a fortunate few\" (558). They claim that vitamin C \"not only increases the time of survival of the patient but also leads to improvement in general health and the feeling of well-being\" (158). They note in their 1979 book that: \"Giving vitamin C in large dosage to patients with advanced cancer produces subjective benefit in almost every patient by about the fifth day. The patient will claim to feel better, stronger, and mentally more alert. Distressing symptoms such as bone pain from skeletal metastases diminish and may even disappear completely... the patient becomes more lively and shows more interest and also eats more food, indicating that he has a better appetite and is no longer feeling nauseated and miserable\" (158). Vitamin C is generally advocated as a supportive measure, not a replacement for mainstream treatment. \"With the possible exception of during intense chemotherapy,\" Cameron and Pauling write, \"we strongly advocate the use of supplemental ascorbate in the management of all cancer patients from as early in the illness as possible...\" (158) to make patients more resistant to their illness and to reduce toxic side effects of mainstream treatment. Cameron and Pauling's 1979 book, Cancer and Vitamin C (158), contains brief case histories of patients who had reportedly exhausted all mainstream treatment options. Responses to vitamin C treatment are categorized as: no response (20% of patients), minimal response (25%), retardation of tumor growth (25%), cytostasis (the \"standstill effect\") tumor regression (9%), and tumor hemorrhage and necrosis (1%). The authors speculate that better results would be seen with earlier adjunctive use of vitamin C with surgery, radiotherapy, or hormonal treatment, although possibly not with chemotherapy (even though vitamin C is stated to protect against unpleasant side effects of the chemotherapy). Pauling states that \"a large body of scientific work clearly shows that vitamin C plays a central and most important role in developing and maintaining the immune system\" and that it is \"a key material necessary to this defense system\" (556). He believes it acts by \"strengthening the natural protective mechanisms of the body and making them more effective\" (158). Potential Adverse Effects Pauling states that large doses of vitamin C can be given over long periods of time without serious side effects. No large case series or placebo controlled studies have revealed any adverse effects of megadoses of vitamin C other than looseness of the bowels. In the two studies conducted by the Mayo Clinic (discussed later in this chapter), vitamin C megadoses were found to be relatively nontoxic (236,622). Mild nausea and vomiting, the most frequent toxic reactions, which affected 40% of patients in the earlier study (236), were seen in identical proportions of treatment and placebo groups. The medical literature contains a few case reports of toxicities that might have been associated with taking large doses of vitamin C. One report suggested a risk of kidney failure in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency (587,696). Vitamin C ingestion may also increase the risk of kidney stones (812), although no cases have been reported. It has also been argued that vitamin C may increase the risk of other types of kidney stone, e.g., urate stones, and Stein and colleagues (833) noted that a single 4 gram dose of vitamin C could increase urinary excretion of uric acid, which might increase the risk of developing urate stones. No cases of urate stones have been reported in the literature, however. Several additional side effects noted in a small number of patients have been attributed to high doses of vitamin C, although the clinical significance of these problems is unclear. These side effects include \"rebound scurvy\" (a scurvy-like syndrome) resulting from sudden cessation of high-dose vitamin C intake (818), gastritis (inflammation of the lining of the stomach due to acidity of vitamin C) (821), hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells) (161), reduction of serum ceruloplasmin activity (which suggests interference with copper metabolism) (290), and iron overload. Attempts at Evaluating High-Dose Vitamin C in Cancer Treatment The first major study reporting clinical results of vitamin C treatment in patients with advanced cancer was published in 1974 by Cameron and Campbell (154). They studied a series of 50 consecutive patients with advanced cancer who were under Cameron's care at the Vale of Leven Hospital in Scotland and who, at the time, had no viable mainstream treatment options. Most patients were treated with 10 g/day of oral ascorbic acid (a liquid formulation), and some began with intravenous ascorbic acid for up to ten days, at a usual dose of 10 g/day (some received higher doses), then switching to the liquid oral formulation. The authors categorized the responses of patients' tumors into the following categories: no response, 17 patients; minimal response, 10 patients; growth retardation, 11 patients; cytostasis (stopping of growth), 3 patients; tumor regression, 5 patients; and tumor hemorrhage and necrosis, 4 patients. In addition, the majority of patients reported improvements in wellbeing. Other benefits included: relief of pain from bone metastases; in one patient, relief of headache from a cranial tumor; reduction in malignant ascites and pleural effusions; reduction in hematuria (blood in the urine) in patients with urinary tract cancers; reduced malignant hepatomegaly (liver enlargement) and reduced malignant jaundice in some patients; and halting or reversal of rising erythrocyte sedimentation rates. The authors also claimed that these patients lived longer than expected, an outcome that cannot be reliably measured in this type of study, which lacked a comparable control group. In a 1976 study (156), Cameron collaborated with Linus Pauling, reporting on the 50 patients from the Cameron and Campbell study described above plus 50 additional ascorbate- treated patients. The patients were matched for certain characteristics (age, sex, and site and histologic features of the primary tumor) in a one to 10 ratio with patients not treated with vitamin C whose records were pulled from the files of the Vale of Leven Hospital. All patients in both groups had been labeled as \"untreatable\" with mainstream treatment. A followup to this study was published in 1978 (157) in which 10 of the original 100 ascorbate-treated patients who had rare cancers were replaced with 10 patients with more common cancers, for whom 10 good control \"matches\" could be made. A new control group was chosen from the same pool of hospital cases as for the earlier study (about half of the earlier control group was also in this group). In the 1976 and 1978 papers, comparisons of survival from: 1) first \"hospital attendance,\" and 2) \"date of untreatability\" were presented. In the later results, which were somewhat more extreme than the earlier ones, a survival time from date of untreatability for vitamin C patients of 293 days was reported, compared with 38 days for the control patients. The survival times from first hospital attendance were 681 days for treated and 360 for control patients. Cameron knew that these studies were \"less than perfect\" methodologically, but he hoped that they would stimulate interest among investigators with experience in clinical trial design to carry out randomized trials (153). The experience of 99 Japanese cancer patients, classified as \"terminal,\" who received vitamin C during the period 1973 through 1977 has been reported by Morishige and Murata (640), researchers affiliated with the Linus Pauling Institute. The most prevalent cancers were of the stomach, lung, and uterus, accounting for more than half the total. Patients were divided into two groups for analysis: \"low- ascorbate,\" defined as zero to four g of vitamin C per day (44 patients), and \"high-ascorbate,\" defined as four or more g/day (14 patients had 5-9 g/day, 13 had 10-29 g/day, and 28 had 30-60 g/day). The practice in the hospital where they were treated had evolved over the time period of this retrospective review toward larger doses, so the low- ascorbate group was treated generally in the earlier years and the high-ascorbate group in later years. Patients in the low- and high-ascorbate groups were compared according to \"survival times after being pronounced terminal.\" The low-ascorbate group survived an average of 43 days and the high-ascorbate group, 201+ days (some patients were still alive at the time the paper was written). The authors concluded that this report \"may be considered to substantiate the observations reported by Cameron and Pauling.\" They further concluded that \"vitamin C seems to improve the state of well being, as indicated by better appetite, increased mental alertness, and desire to return to ordinary life.\" No information is given on how these characteristics were assessed. This study has similar drawbacks to Cameron and Pauling's, mainly that the groups compared were not comparable on factors other than vitamin C. In this study, the two groups were treated at different (though overlapping) time periods, making the comparison more tenuous. The suggestive results of this study, however, reinforced the need for randomized studies. The First Mayo Clinic Study Cameron and Pauling's clinical studies, which generated widespread interest among cancer patients, prompted a series of three NCI-funded randomized trials of vitamin C. The first trial, conducted at the Mayo Clinic, enrolled 150 advanced cancer patients; most (93%) had progressive disease after prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy and the rest were considered too ill to undergo mainstream treatment (236). About 40% of the patients had colorectal cancer, which was also a prevalent type in Cameron's studies. About 20% had pancreatic cancer, 10% had lung cancer, and the rest had various other types of cancer. Of the 150 patients randomized to receive vitamin C or placebo, 27 chose not to participate immediately following randomization, before they had taken any of their assigned medication. The 63 patients in the control group were given a \"comparably flavored lactose placebo.\" The vitamin C dose was 10 g/day, as recommended by Cameron and Pauling, taken as 20 500-milligram capsules; those taking the placebo were also given 20 capsules per day. Treatment was continued until death or until the patient was no longer able to take the oral treatment. Median survival for all patients in the study was about seven weeks. The survival curves for the vitamin C-treated and placebo- treated groups were nearly identical. In the entire study population, there was one long-term survivor, a patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer, who had a massively enlarged liver, and jaundice. He had not responded to \"many previous attempts at chemotherapy,\" but had symptomatic improvement and some reduction of the jaundice, and was alive 63 weeks after entering the study. This patient was in the placebo group. The two groups of patients taking vitamin C or placebo were found to be similar in the percentages of patients experiencing symptomatic relief and side effects. About a quarter in each group reported improved appetite, and about 40%, improved activity levels. Improvements in strength and pain control were slightly greater in the vitamin C group (63% of patients) compared to controls (58%), but this difference was not statistically significant. More than 40% of both vitamin C and placebo groups reported nausea and leg swelling, between 20 and 40% reported vomiting, heartburn, and diarrhea. Creagan and coauthors concluded that vitamin C conferred no significant survival or symptomatic benefit on the patients in the study. Noting that the patients in this study differed, however, from those in Cameron and Pauling's studies in at least one respect \u2014 prior treatment with immunosuppressive chemotherapy \u2014Creagan stated that it was impossible to draw any conclusions about the possible effectiveness of vitamin C in previously untreated patients. The immune systems of the patients in Creagan's study may have been more compromised (though not considered entirely unable of mounting an immune response) than Cameron's patients, few of whom had received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. Creagan and colleagues noted that their patients' \"earlier immunosuppressive treatment might have obscured any benefit\" resulting from vitamin C. The Second Mayo Clinic Study The postulated interference of previous chemotherapy on the action of vitamin C prompted the Mayo Clinic investigators to undertake another randomized trial, this time including only patients with no previous chemotherapy (622). All patients had advanced colorectal cancer, a type claimed by Cameron and Pauling to respond well to vitamin C, and one for which no chemotherapy was recommended at the time of the study. These patients were not considered eligible for surgery or radiation. The doses of vitamin C and placebo were the same as for the first Mayo Clinic trial and were administered orally in the form of 20 tablets per day. No intravenous or oral liquid doses were used. The endpoints in this trial were: survival after randomization, time to disease progression, objective regression, toxicity, and changes in pre-trial symptoms. One hundred and one patients were randomized, one dropping out before taking any of the capsules, so the analysis is based on the 100 patients who participated. Eight patients stopped taking the capsules or reduced their dosage for a variety of reasons. Three of these cases were known to be related to adverse effects of treatment: one taking placebo stopped because of intolerable side effects, and the other two, who were taking vitamin C, reduced dosages because of gastrointestinal upset. All treatment was stopped at progression of disease, worsening of symptoms or performance status, or loss of body weight. As in the first Mayo Clinic study, side effects were similar among the two groups, and not generally severe. The study found no difference in time to progression of disease and no increase in survival time in patients treated with vitamin C; through the first year of followup, 49% of patients taking vitamin C and 47% of patients taking placebo were alive, and there was a substantially larger proportion of long-term survivors in the placebo group. No patients in the study had measurable tumor regression. Eleven vitamin C-treated and 17 placebo- treated patients had some cancer symptoms at the beginning of the trial; 7 and 11, respectively (about equal proportions), reported symptomatic relief during the trial. The Third Mayo Clinic Study According to one of the investigators in the first two studies, a third, multi-center randomized trial, with similar treatment regimens to the first two trials, was undertaken to address criticism that the earlier trials may have been inherently biased because they were single-center trials (234). The only published report of this trial gives preliminary results in abstract form (859). The authors report no survival benefit, but \"a possible but not significant trend of improved appetite, strength and pain control in the vitamin C group but no change in disability.\" The median survival of all patients in the study was 6.5 weeks. Little other information is given. According to one of the investigators (235), analysis of this study was never completed because the early results were unpromising, consistent with the results of the two previous studies. He believed that the vitamin C question had been laid to rest and did not consider it important to complete and publish full details of this study. Australian Study A clinical trial of the effect of megadoses of vitamin C on survival in cancer patients was begun in 1982 at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, Australia (152,540). The results of the study have not yet been published, so only the design can be described here (541). Using a double-blind, randomized prospective format, the study focused on survival time among 99 patients with Dukes D colorectal cancer who had not undergone major surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy for at least four weeks prior to entry in the trial. Asymptomatic patients were randomized to receive either vitamin C (10 g in liquid oral doses) or placebo (liquid oral citric acid), while symptomatic patients were randomized to receive mainstream chemotherapy plus vitamin C or chemotherapy plus placebo. The vitamin C or placebo mixtures were to be continued in each patient regardless of changes in their clinical status. The study protocol did not indicate whether patients were tested for compliance to the regimen by performing urine or blood analyses for ascorbate. According to one researcher who interviewed the principal investigator of the study, no survival benefit of vitamin C over placebo was found in the study (757). OTA was unable to obtain further details about the results of this study. Methodologic Issues in Evaluations of Vitamin C The explicit aim of the first two Mayo Clinic studies was to confirm or refute Cameron and Pauling's assertion that patients treated with megadoses of vitamin C would live longer than expected and would benefit from an improved quality of life during their illness. The Mayo Clinic studies attempted to test Cameron's treatment regimen in prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies designed to generate unbiased conclusions about effects of the treatment. As discussed above, Moertel and colleagues found that patients who were randomly assigned to vitamin C had no survival advantage over patients assigned to placebo. A major consideration in interpreting Cameron and Pauling's positive results is the possibility that \"selection bias,\" a problem often encountered in retrospective, uncontrolled studies, was responsible for the apparent success of the treatment. Cameron does not deny the existence of inherent flaws in his studies, but he argues that the Mayo Clinic trials did not adequately test his premise or reproduce his procedure, and therefore do not refute his conclusions. Several important methodologic issues raised by the Mayo Clinic studies, some of which have been debated in a number of published letters and articles (621,708,710,755,756), are summarized below. Types of Patients Enrolled \u2014In Cameron's study, few patients were previously treated with chemotherapy, whereas in the first Mayo Clinic study, the majority had previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Pauling argued that vitamin C acted by strengthening patients' immune systems and that those who were previously exposed to cytotoxic chemotherapy were less capable of responding to the immune-enhancing effects of vitamin C than were patients who had not had chemotherapy. Creagan and colleagues argued that, although the patients were immunosuppressed, they were not totally incapable of generating an immune response. They noted, however, that their results in pretreated patients did not allow them to draw conclusions about the possible effectiveness of vitamin C in previously untreated patients. The second Mayo Clinic study addressed this issue by enrolling patients who more closely resembled Cameron's patients \u2014 patients with advanced cancer of the large bowel who were previously unexposed to cytotoxic drugs. Method of Administration of Ascorbate \u2014Cameron administered ascorbic acid either by intravenous solution or by oral liquid doses. In Moertel's studies, patients were instructed to take 20 tablets orally per day. It has been argued that higher blood levels of ascorbate could have been achieved using intravenous administration compared with either oral form, but this was not measured in any of the studies reported here. Also, since oral doses given in liquid form are generally easier to take than are 20 pills a day, patient compliance with the oral tablet regimen could have been lower than with an oral liquid regimen. Testing for Compliance to the Regimen \u2014It is possible that some patients in the Mayo Clinic trials may have taken fewer than the assigned 20 pills a day (which could result in lower vitamin C doses in the treatment group) and that some patients may have self-medicated with commonly available vitamin C supplements outside of the trial (which could result in higher vitamin C levels in the placebo group). One or both of these possibilities could reduce the difference observed between treatment and control groups and thereby make the detection of treatment effects more unlikely. Ascorbate concentrations in the body can be measured in samples of urine or blood. Such testing by urinalysis was not conducted in the first Mayo Clinic trial, but was done to a limited extent in the second trial, where eleven patients were tested at one point: five patients assigned to the vitamin C group showed high urine ascorbate levels, and five patients assigned to the placebo group had \"negligible\" levels within the range of normal controls for the assay. The other patient assigned to the placebo group had an intermediate level, but the result was attributed to problems with the assay in that case. Cameron and Pauling argued that the levels of ascorbate measured in patients assigned to the placebo group were higher than would be expected for cancer patients and that the testing was incomplete and inadequate to verify compliance with the regimen, since only about 10% of the patients were tested and then only once during the study. Moertel argued that their data, based on patient compliance records and urinalyses, indicated that patient compliance with the regimen was very high and that self- medication among the patients assigned to the placebo group did not occur. Testing for ascorbate in blood, rather than urine, may have provided more meaningful data, particularly if such testing were done periodically during the study. Duration of Treatment \u2014It is common in clinical trials of cytotoxic agents for treatment to be withdrawn when patients show signs of tumor progression. In Cameron's studies, vitamin C was administered to patients in most cases until the time of death, since it was believed that vitamin C acts not by direct cytotoxic action, but by strengthening patients' resistance to the disease, slowing the rate of tumor progression, or increasing the patient's ability to forestall death even in the presence of the disease. In the second Mayo Clinic trial, vitamin C or placebo was withdrawn when patients showed signs of significant tumor progression or deterioration in general or symptomatic status, since such signs were taken to indicate treatment failure. Cameron and Pauling argue that normal procedures for dealing with cytotoxic drugs in clinical trials should not have been applied to vitamin C. In addition, Pauling believes that patients could have been harmed by the sudden cessation of high doses of vitamin C, and that gradual reduction in dose is a safer approach to stopping treatment. Pauling states that high blood levels of vitamin C can drop to below normal levels when intake is stopped abruptly (described as the \"rebound effect\") and that for a period of a week or two, very low ascorbate levels can cause greater susceptibility to infection, decreased resistance to the disease, or worsening of an existing condition (158,555). Experimental evidence exists for a biochemical effect in the body of sudden cessation of high doses of vitamin C, but it has not yet been shown that these biochemical changes lead to overt changes in physical condition among cancer patients. In Moertel's study, patients treated with and then withdrawn from vitamin C showed similar survival times compared to patients in the placebo group, but other possible adverse effects of ascorbate withdrawal were not specifically reported. Although the Mayo Clinic trials addressed some of the relevant questions pertaining to the effects of vitamin C, they do not appear to have settled the controversy surrounding its efficacy in cancer treatment. In addition to the issues discussed above, the Mayo Clinic trials did not fully address Cameron and Pauling's claims that vitamin C improves the quality of life of advanced cancer patients in helping to control pain and improving general wellbeing. Cameron and Pauling found easing of pain particularly in patients with bone metastases; few patients in the Mayo Clinic trials had bone metastases. Among the issues noted above, only the issue of testing patients not previously treated with chemotherapy was addressed in subsequent evaluations. The other issues remain unresolved and lead to difficulties in interpreting the results of the two Mayo Clinic studies. Cameron reported that he and Pauling submitted a collection of \"best cases\" to NCI for review in December 1989. According to Cameron, NCI is sponsoring a symposium at NIH in September 1990, on experimental research concerning biological functions of ascorbate in relation to cancer (153). [OTA Report Index](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/OTA/ota16.html) ||| [Quackwatch Home This on August 3, 1998. [Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-four-hundred-thirty-eight) [OTA Report: Methods of the Study](https://quackwatch.org/related/ota/ota13/) John Dingell, Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote to OTA in August 1986 asking that a study be done of treatments for cancer that are \"out of the mainstream.\" The request stated: Many of these treatments may be without benefit, some may actually be harmful, and some, probably a small number, may have value. However, there is a general lack of objective information about them, thus making rational decisions about such alternative therapies extremely difficult.

John Dingell, Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote to OTA in August 1986 asking that a study be done of treatments for cancer that are \"out of the mainstream.\" The request stated: Many of these treatments may be without benefit, some may actually be harmful, and some, probably a small number, may have value. However, there is a general lack of objective information about them, thus making rational decisions about such alternative therapies extremely difficult. The letter asked OTA to describe the treatments and look into policy issues surrounding their availability and evaluation. Congressman Dingell's letter also recognized the letters OTA had received from then-Congressman Molinari and 42 other Members of the House and Senate requesting that OTA review the existing data on the efficacy of a particular treatment, Immuno-Augmentative Therapy (IAT), and design a formal evaluation plan for that treatment. Congressman Dingell suggested that OTA consider the IAT work as a case study within the larger study. By statute, OTA may undertake assessments at the request of the Chairman of any full committee of the Congress. The Chairman may request the work personally, on behalf of a ranking minority member, or on behalf of a majority of the committee members. OTA's Board may also request work, as may the Director of OTA, but individual Members of Congress, such as then-Congressman Molinari do not have authority to request assessments. In response to Congressman Dingell and the requests about IAT, OTA proposed a study titled \"Nontraditional Methods of Cancer Management: Science and Policy Issues,\" which was approved by the Technology Assessment Board (TAB; OTA's governing body) in September 1986. (The title was changed twice, based on advice of the Advisory Panel and others, ending with the published title of Unconventional Cancer Treatments.) The study was to begin in January 1987, with a final report to be delivered to TAB in June 1988 (with publication some months later), and preceding that, the case study on IAT to be delivered in December 1987. Because of the difficulty of gathering information for the study and the extensive interactions with the public and Congress concerning it, the TAB delivery date was extended four times, and the report was finally delivered to TAB in July 1990. Project Advisory Panel and IAT Working Group One of the first tasks was the appointment of an Advisory Panel, a feature of every major OTA project. Advisory Panels include individuals from outside the Federal Government with expertise in the various areas covered in the assessment, and representing the important points of view on the issue at hand. Advisory Panels do not write, nor do they take responsibility for, the content of OTA reports, but their participation is considered essential to producing fair and authoritative reports. Choosing an Advisory Panel for this study required OTA to go beyond the mainstream medical sphere in which it usually operates. Many contacts with unconventional representatives were made through an initial contact with Michael Lerner, President of Commonweal, who was asked to be a special consultant to the study. In addition, a long list of individuals recommended to be on the Advisory Panel was received unsolicited from a group called the \"Coalition for the Evaluation of Alternative Therapy,\" a coalition of preexisting groups that appeared to have formed in response to the OTA study. (The Coalition no longer exists.) The Advisory Panel was chosen with consultation from Dr. Lerner. The chairperson, chosen by OTA, is Rosemary Stevens, a medical historian who had not worked specifically in the area of unconventional medicine. The Advisory Panel contains individuals generally supportive of unconventional treatments (8 members), individuals who were openly opposed (2), and individuals with technical expertise clearly allied to mainstream medicine and research, but who had not taken a position against unconventional treatments (8). Dr. Lerner also functioned very much like an Advisory Panel member in his capacity as special consultant. In addition to the Advisory Panel, the project staff appointed a second group, the \"IAT Working Group,\" to assist with designing a clinical trial protocol for IAT. This group consisted of individuals with technical expertise in clinical trial design, plus an appointed representative each from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Lawrence Burton, developer of IAT, was asked to participate as well; he appointed a patient, the founder of the IAT Patients Association, to represent him and also asked that a statistician (the husband of one of Burton's patients) who was interested in IAT, be included. This was done. Dr. Lerner was associated with this group as well. Meetings of the Advisory Panel First Meeting The Advisory Panel first met in July 1987. A preliminary outline of the report was presented by the project staff. Areas for contract work had been identified, as had some potential contractors. At that time, however, only one contract had been let, to Michael Lerner, to produce a \"conceptual framework\" for analyzing the various treatments to be covered, and to provide background information on a wide range of treatments. Advisory Panel guidance was solicited for prospective contractors for the other areas. The meeting was notable for bringing the unconventional treatment supporters together with the mainstream in a neutral forum. Discussion was generally non-confrontational and informative. However, undoubtedly because of the difficulty of the topic and lack of precedence for a study of this type, no clear direction for the report as a whole emerged. Second Meeting The second Advisory Panel meeting was held in late July 1988. A partial draft of the report was sent to the Advisory Panel for discussion at this meeting. OTA had asked the panel not to circulate this draft to others because of its preliminary nature, but, as it turned out, it was widely copied and circulated, and a large number of observers at the panel meeting had copies. One, Robert Houston, had prepared a critique, \"Objections to a Cover-Up: The OTA Report on Alternative Therapies,\" which he distributed at the meeting. Other groups, e.g., Project Cure and the IAT Patients Association, also passed out literature. Observer comments were allowed by the chairperson as appropriate. The tense atmosphere and combative nature of many of the observers and panel members strained the discussion. There was a great deal of criticism of the draft, largely from the panel members on the unconventional side. Their main concerns were, first, that there had not been enough time for them to review the draft, that the draft was incomplete, and particularly, that policy issues were presented orally at the meeting, but had not yet been written. There was also criticism that too much emphasis had been placed on adverse effects, that the \"scientific development\" of the treatments was not discussed sufficiently, and that traditional practitioners and New Age approaches were given too prominent a place. Third Meeting The latter half of 1988 and all of 1989 was spent rewriting the report almost in its entirety, relying less on contract papers and more on OTA staff research, which proved necessary for a thorough treatment of the subject. A complete draft, with policy options, was sent to the Advisory Panel about one month before a meeting in early March 1990. Copies of the draft were also sent to more than 200 other individuals and groups for review before the meeting. OTA invited requests from outside reviewers to address the meeting if they had serious criticisms of the report. Fifteen responded, and their statements took up the morning of the meeting. These were: - Seymour M. Brenner, M.D., Community Radiology Associates, P.G - Peter Chowka - Michael L. Culbert, The Committee for Freedom of Choice in Medicine, Inc. - Michael Evers, Project Cure - Robert G. Houston - Richard A. Jaffe, attorney for Stanislaw Burzynski - Wolfram Kuhnau, American Biologics - Virginia Livingston, Livingston-Wheeler Clinic - Clinton Ray Miller, National Health Federation - Ralph Moss, The Cancer Chronicles - Vivien Newbold, M.D. - Maryann Roper, M.D., National Cancer Institute - Janet I. Smith, MSAM, Consumer Health Strategies - Patricia Spain Ward, University of Illinois - Frank D. Wiewel, IAT Patients' Association, Inc. The presentations ranged from reasoned critique to presentation of additional information to shouted personal attacks on the integrity of the project staff. In the afternoon, the panel discussed the draft. There seemed to be two major themes: first that, throughout the draft, OTA had failed to highlight the \"middle ground,\" except in the chapter on psychological and behavioral approaches. Second, that what was needed for fair treatment of unconventional cancer treatments was a \"level playing field.\" There was also considerable discussion about the tone of the report, which was perceived as unduly critical of unconventional treatments. To the extent possible, given the hostile atmosphere, policy options were discussed, as well as other parts of the report. As at the second meeting, many spectators, in addition to those scheduled, were allowed opportunities to speak. The OTA Director, along with the Assistant Director for Health and Life Sciences, the Health Program Manager, the project staff, and other OTA officials, were present for the entire meeting. A number of TAB staff and other Congressional staff members also attended. IAT Case Study The conduct of the IAT case study is discussed in the latter part of chapter 6. The IAT Working Group met twice during the course of the study, in March 1987 and May 1988. OTA staff (accompanied by an FDA official on the second trip) met with Burton and his representatives in the Bahamas twice. These meetings are all discussed in some detail in chapter 6. Workshop on Evaluation Methods Early in the project, in October 1987, OTA held a 2-day workshop at Commonweal, in Bolinas, California, hosted by Michael Lerner, to explore issues related to evaluating unconventional cancer treatments. The idea was to bring together experts in evaluation methodology with individuals knowledgeable about the details of unconventional cancer treatments. Some members of the Advisory Panel, members of the IAT Working Group, one evaluation expert from the National Cancer Institute, and several others attended. Some of the ideas that arose from the workshop are discussed in chapter 12. The Review Process About 250 copies of the February 1990 draft were sent out for review. Comments were requested by the end of March, but the deadline was extended for anyone asking for more time. Comments were received through the end of May from a total of approximately 75 individuals and organizations. Many comments consisted mainly of attacks on the integrity of the project staff and other OTA officials. Others were of a more substantive nature. Eight members of the Advisory Panel generally supportive of unconventional treatments wrote a set of joint comments, including discussion of the \"middle ground\" and \"level playing field\" issues of the third panel meeting. Robert Houston again wrote a long critique, which was published in March 1990 by \"People Against Cancer,\" entitled \"Misinformation from OTA on Unconventional Cancer Treatments.\" Revisions to the report included attempting to obtain and incorporate, to the extent possible, new material suggested by reviewers, and some restructuring in response to comments (e.g., elimination of the chapter on spiritual approaches). The final report is significantly more complete as a result of the review. In addition, the IAT case study, whose planning with Burton had recently come to an unsuccessful end, was folded into a separate chapter about IAT. In addition to the usual editing done at OTA, the Advisory Panel chairperson offered to edit the summary and options chapter (chapter 1), as the last step before the final draft was sent to TAB, to assist with what were referred to as \"tone problems\" by Advisory Panel members. In their joint letter to OTA, a group of panel members referred to the \"distinguished Advisory Board chairman, Rosemary Stevens, Ph.D.,\" stating that they would be \"very happy with a tone that reflected her judicious historian's balance.\" All of Dr. Stevens editing suggestions were incorporated into the final version. Mail-in Campaigns Relating to the Project OTA and Members of Congress, particularly the membership of TAB, have been the object of mail-in campaigns by several unconventional treatment advocacy groups during the course of the project. Thousands of pre-printed postcards and letters (e.g., from the Coalition for Nutrition and Health, Project Cure, the Foundation for the Advancement of Innovative Medicine), and tearsheets from an alternative magazine (Health Freedom News, the magazine of the National Health Federation) have been received. The content of these has varied, but they have generally been highly critical of OTA practices, the project staff and other OTA officials, and the draft report. OTA did not, in general, respond individually to these form letters. TAAC Meeting The February 28, 1989 meeting of OTA's Technology Assessment Advisory Committee (TAAC) was devoted to this project. (TAAC is a Congressionally mandated group of 10 eminent individuals appointed by the Technology Assessment Board to advise OTA. In addition, the Comptroller General of the United States and the Director of the Congressional Research Service serve as statutory members.) Rosemary Stevens, the Chairperson of the Advisory Panel, Michael Lerner, special consultant to the project, and Richard Riegelman, a member of the Advisory Panel, also participated in the meeting. In a memorandum to TAAC members, the Director of OTA gave this purpose to the discussion: The sharpness of the controversy about the substance and approach to this study has greatly exceeded the normal clash of opinions accompanying OTA's studies. For this reason, we are asking the TAAC and three guests to consider the fairness and thoroughness of the study approach and results. Briefing materials were sent to TAAC members before the meeting, acquainting them both with the assessment itself and the controversies that had arisen around it. At the meeting, the history of the project was reviewed, in both content and process. Plans for finishing the project and for ensuring objectivity to the end of the process were discussed in detail. After finishing at OTA, TAAC met with TAB and discussed its review of this study. Communication With Congressional Staff Over the course of this project, about half of all the Congressional offices contacted OTA by letter or telephone for information. These requests were usually in followup to contacts by constituents, who either wrote individual letters or participated in one of several mail-in campaigns organized by advocacy groups. Project staff discussed the project by telephone and provided current \"one-pagers\" on the main project and on IAT in response to these requests. Communication With the Public OTA received hundreds of telephone calls and letters (both individual and mass-produced) about this study. Most phone callers were looking for information about particular treatments, usually on behalf of a friend or relative with cancer. Most had found out about the study through articles in alternative magazines or papers or by word of mouth. To the extent possible, project staff provided general information or directed them to other sources of information. The one-page study descriptions were also sent to the public. Particularly during the period of the draft review, many people called and wrote to register disapproval of the report. In general, these were not people who had seen copies, but were repeating views publicized by advocacy organizations. Other Inputs to Report Contractor Papers Michael S. Evers, J.D.: \"Legal Constraints on the Availability of Unorthordox Cancer Treatments: Freedom of Choice Viewpoint\" The purpose of this contract was to describe the laws, regulations, and other legal constraints on unconventional cancer treatments, specifically giving the legal basis for the \"freedom of choice\" point of view. Evers heads one of the major unconventional treatment advocacy groups. It was used in writing chapters 10 and 11. A similar contract was awarded to Ronald D. Schwartz and Rebecca L. Burke, to represent the \"consumer protection\" point of view. Vicki S. Freimuth, Ph.D.: \"The Public Search for Information on Unorthodox Cancer Treatments: The CIS Experience\" The purpose of this contract was to describe the way in which the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service handles requests for information about unconventional cancer treatments. The contract included an analysis of all calls recorded by the CIS over a 4-year period in which unconventional treatments were discussed. Information from this contract appears in chapters 7 and 8. Janice Guthrie: \"Sources of Information on Unorthodox Cancer Therapies\" and \"Personal Narrative\" Under this contract, Ms. Guthrie provided OTA with a comprehensive list of sources of information on unconventional cancer treatments and she obtained for OTA brochures, audio tapes, and other sources of information from specific clinics and practitioners. Her narrative, referred to in chapter 7, describes her personal experience with unconventional cancer treatments. The material provided under this contract was used in many places in the report. Sharon Hammond: \"An Examination of the Public Education Efforts of Three Mainstream Cancer Organizations\" The purpose of this contract was to describe the educational activities related to unconventional cancer treatment of the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, and the American Society for Clinical Oncology. Some of this information appears in chapter 8. David J. Hufford, Ph.D.: \"Cultural and Social Perspectives on Unorthodox Cancer Treatment\" This report provided general background and context for unconventional cancer treatments. It is referred to in several places in the report. David J. Hufford, Ph.D.: \"Selected, Unorthodox Cancer Practitioners\" This report describes \"New Age\" and traditional healers, faith healers, Christian Science healers, and others. Hufford's report was instrumental in helping to understand these healing systems and in deciding not to cover them in detail in the report. David J. Hufford, Ph.D.: \"Health Food Store Survey on Alternative Cancer Treatment Information\" Under this contract, Hufford coordinated a survey by graduate students of information about unconventional cancer treatments available in health food stores three cities. The results are reported in chapter 7. Michael Lerner, Ph.D.: \"Toward a Framework for the Analysis of Unconventional Cancer Therapies\" This contract report served to help categorize treatments generally by content, and described positive aspects of a number of specific treatments in each category. It also provided general background material. Material from this report is referred to in a number of places in the report. Daniel J. Morris, M.D.: \"Feasibility of Identifying and Gaining Access to Medical Records of IAT Patients Who Have Also Been Seen in Florida Medical Facilities Since January 1986\" The purpose of this contract was to determine whether any useful information about IAT could be gathered from other medical institutions where IAT patients had been treated. Dr. Morris discussed this approach at an IAT Working Group meeting. It is discussed briefly in chapter 6. Anne Paxton: \"Practitioners of Unorthodox Cancer Treatments\" The purpose of this contract was to describe various types of unconventional practitioner (e.g., holistic physicians, naturopaths, homeopaths). Little of the information from this contract was used in the final report. Terence M. Phillips, Ph.D., D.Sc.: \"Critical Review of Published Pre-Clinical Studies by Lawrence Burton, Ph.D.\" The purpose of this contract was to review Burton's published work of the 1950s and 1960s, on fruitflies and mice, mainly, which Burton says is the basis of Immuno- Augmentative Therapy (IAT). Phillips is a clinical immunologist and protein chemist. Material from his report appears in chapter 6. Terence M. Phillips, Ph.D., D.Sc.: \"Review and Analysis of Lawrence Burton's Patented Processes and Products\" OTA was urged by Burton's supporters to review his patents. Phillips was asked to analyze the patents, critique the procedures, and determine, if possible, what materials would be produced by them. He was also asked to determine any relationship to Burton's published pre-clinical work. Material from this patent review appears in chapter 6. Ronald D. Schwartz, J.D., Rebecca L. Burke, J.D.: \"Legal Constraints on the Availability of Unorthodox Cancer Treatments: Consumer Protection Point of View\" This purpose of this contract was to describe the laws, regulations, and other legal constraints on unconventional cancer treatments, specifically giving the legal basis for the \"consumer protection\" point of view. It was used in writing chapters 10 and 11. (See above, report by Michael S. Evers.) Patricia Spain Ward, Ph.D.: \"History of Hoxsey Treatment,\" \"History of Gerson Therapy,\" and \"History of BCG\" The purpose of this contract was to describe the historical antecedents and development of three popular unconventional cancer treatments. (A fourth, macrobiotics, was included in the statement of work but was dropped by mutual consent of the contractor and OTA.) Material from these reports appears mainly in chapters 3 and 4. Robert Watson: \"Quality of Life Assessment Instruments: A Review of 32 Current Measures and One Classic\" The purpose of this contract was to provide an annotated bibliography of methods used to assess quality of life. It was decided later in the project not to cover this in detail. Jack Z. Yetiv, M.D., Ph.D.: \"Adverse Medical Consequences of Unorthodox Cancer Treatments\" This report provided information on reported and suspected adverse effects of unconventional treatments, to complement the selectively positive information in the Lerner contract. The contract was let after receiving Lerner's draft, in which he stated that his emphasis was on the positive aspects, and he had not covered the \"casualties of unconventional cancer therapies\" thoroughly. Other Sources A paper prepared by Keith I. Block, M.D., an Advisory Panel member, and Charlotte Gyllenhall, Ph.D., (\"Nutrition: An Essential Tool in Cancer Therapy\") was used as a primary source in chapter 3. Extensive conversations with Richard Jaffe, an attorney associated with several unconventional practitioners, provided much of the basis for the \"freedom of choice\" discussion in chapter 10 and for some of the ideas presented in chapter 9 concerning insurance coverage for unconventional cancer treatments. A review of 50 case histories of patients in the Kelley program, as described in an unpublished manuscript by Nicholas Gonzalez, M.D., was carried out by members of the Advisory Panel at the request of OTA. The results are reported in chapter 3. Some Advisory Panel members also reviewed case histories of patients treated with a macrobiotic regimen, as reported by Vivien Newbold, M.D. This also is reported in chapter 3. To obtain information about laboratory testing of the herbs contained in Hoxsey's formulas and Essiac, OTA had searches of the published literature carried out by NAPRALERT, which maintains a data base on natural products.

Science Needs to Combat Pseudoscience: A Statement by 32 Russian Scientists and Philosophers Representatives of many sciences and disciplines \u2014 astronomers, physicists, chemists, biologists, philosophers, lawyers, psychologists \u2014 are concerned by the widespread growth of astrology, alternative medicine, palmistry, numerology, and mystic pseudoscience in Russia and other countries of the world. We wish to draw the attention of the public to the threat of an uncritical attitude to the prophesies and advice of modern \"practitioners of the occult sciences,\" proffered both privately and in the mass media. Those who believe in the dependence of human fate on heavenly bodies, magic substances, or witchcraft need to understand that science can in no way provide support for these beliefs. In bygone times people believed in and used astrology, alchemy, cabalistic mysticism, and alternative folk medicine. These ideas were a substantial part of the mythological and magical view of the world providing a prescientific weltanschaaung and cognitive purpose, for science was taking its first steps. People believed that the heavenly bodies were the manifestations of the forces of gods that could magically influence earthly objects. Physical processes seemed to be the product of cryptic \"hidden properties,\" and chemical elements seemed to be the product of magic. People had no understanding of the nature of chemical and physical interactions. Today, when science understands the main causes by which heavenly bodies influence phenomena on Earth, there are no scientifically based reasons to claim that these occult interactions may influence the destiny of humans. A person's psychophysiological structures are not determined by the position of the stars and planets at the time and place of birth, but by the inherited genetic code and sociocultural factors. Astrology mystically interprets the variations of the geomagnetic field and solar activity that have an effect on human well-being. Solar flares and magnetic storms actually do have an effect on the human psyche and on human behavior, but astrology and quack medicine do not provide an understanding of these phenomena. Living organisms do manifest a feeble electromagnetic radiation, but there is no known scientific evidence to claim the existence of \"biofields\" or \"psychic energy.\" The astrological calendar does not correspond to actual physical reality, but only provides archaic metaphorical descriptions of astronomical events. Superstitious beliefs and the uncritical acceptance of coincidences as causative undermine our reliance on the capacity of human beings to realistically face the events of life. Astrologers, parapsychologists, and clairvoyants assert untested claims based on pseudoscience; they organize academics and grant degrees. Many people believe in clairvoyance, astrology, and other superstitions to compensate for the psychological discomforts of our time. Others seek the advice of outside authorities in making significant decisions. Personal and social problems, with which one cannot cope, drive one to witches, shamans, and quack therapists. The belief in astral forces provides an opportunity to evade the responsibility for choice and absolves people of accepting their own mistakes. At a time of widespread dissemination of scientific education and great advances in science, we can no longer assume that superstitions will disappear of their own accord. On the contrary, society is now inundated by the \"occult sciences.\" The propagators of pseudoscience and \"cryptic knowledge\" attempt to take over the mantle, terms, and methods of genuine science. Astrology, for example, attempts to influence political and economic decisions, shamelessly intruding into the private lives of persons. Much of this is encouraged by the mass media, playing on and exploiting human fallibilities. Mystic pseudoscience is an international malady that has stricken many countries of the world. This prompted a public statement in 1975 criticizing astrology by 186 leading scientists (including eighteen Nobel Prize-winners), which was widely acclaimed throughout the world. Today it is time for the community of Russian scientists to confront these issues with all their power. One of the unquestionably great achievements of recent years is the opportunity for people to express their opinions openly. Unfortunately, many people are ensnared by the persuasive power of absurd and dangerous superstitions; they must not be conned by their pseudoscientific attire. No attempts to make magical thinking scientifically respectable can possibly conceal their utter incompatibility with science.
