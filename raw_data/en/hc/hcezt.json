In today's world the liver has to work harder than ever. The liver is somewhat like the body's digestive control center. When substances reach the liver, they're processed and either circulated, stored, altered, detoxified or flushed away through urine and stool. The liver is the gateway to the body and in this chemical age its detoxification systems are easily overloaded. Thousands of chemicals are added to food and over 700 have been identified in drinking water. Plants are sprayed with toxic chemicals, animals are injected with potent hormones and antibiotics and a significant amount of our food is genetically engineered, processed, refined, frozen and cooked. All this can lead to destruction of delicate vitamins and minerals, which are needed for the [ detoxification pathways in the liver](https://www.drnirvana.com/product/core-restore-detox-program/). The liver must try to cope with every toxic chemical in our environment, as well as damaged fats that are present in processed and fried foods. The [ liver is the cleanser](https://www.drnirvana.com/detox/detox-iv/) and filter of the blood stream and is of vital importance. Many of the toxic chemicals that enter the body are fat-soluble which means they dissolve only in fatty or oily solutions and not in water. Fat-soluble chemicals have a high affinity for fat tissues and cell membranes, which are made of fatty substances. In these fatty parts of the body toxins may be stored for years, being released during times of exercise, stress, fasting, or [weight loss](https://www.drnirvana.com/weight-loss/). During the release of these toxins, symptoms such as headaches, poor memory, stomach pain, nausea, fatigue, dizziness and palpitations may occur. Once released, the liver is designed to convert fat-soluble chemicals into water-soluble chemicals so that they may then be easily excreted from the body via watery fluids such as the bile and urine. How The Liver Detoxifies Harmful Substances Basically there are two major detoxification pathways inside the liver cells which are called the Phase One and Phase Two [detoxification pathways](https://www.drnirvana.com/product/core-restore-detox-program/). During Phase One, the liver converts a toxic chemical into a less harmful chemical. If [ antioxidants](https://www.drnirvana.com/immune-booster-shots/) are lacking, toxic chemicals become far more dangerous. During Phase Two, the liver cells add another substance to a toxic chemical or drug to render it less harmful. This makes the toxin or drug water-soluble so it can then be excreted from the body via watery fluids such as bile or urine. Eggs and cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower) and raw garlic, onions, leeks and shallots are all good sources of natural sulphur compounds to enhance phase two detoxification. Thus these foods can be considered to have a cleansing action because they are so high in sulphur compounds. One of the most important antioxidants in our body with the highest sulphur containing power, is [glutathione](https://www.drnirvana.com/glutathione-iv/). Glutathione is the most powerful internal antioxidant and liver protector. It can be depleted by large amounts of toxins and/or drugs passing through the liver as well as fasting, stress, illness, alcohol and sugar.
