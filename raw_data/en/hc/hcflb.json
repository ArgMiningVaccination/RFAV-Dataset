Kennedy Jr. [is an outspoken vaccine skeptic](http://traceamounts.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-s-book-on-the-subject/), and on Tuesday he said President-elect Donald Trump tapped him to head up \"a commission on vaccination safety and scientific integrity.\" Trump [has openly questioned](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/09/17/the-origins-of-donald-trumps-autismvaccine-theory-and-how-it-was-completely-debunked-eons-ago/?utm_term=.fe5d168324f9) the \"link\" between vaccines and autism before and during the presidential campaign \u2014 a belief that has been completely [debunked](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html) and [discredited](http://healthland.time.com/2010/05/24/doctor-behind-vaccine-autism-link-loses-license/).

And that everybody ought to be able to be assured that the vaccines that we have \u2014 he's very pro-vaccine, as am I \u2014 but they're as safe as they possibly can be.\" Late on Tuesday, the Trump transition team walked back Kennedy's claim. \"The president-elect enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas,\" said spokeswoman Hope Hicks. \"The president-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on autism, which affects so many families; however no decisions have been made at this time. The anti-vaxxers are a fringe movement, but a vocal one.

[Yoel Inbar](http://yoelinbar.net/), a psychologist at the University of Toronto who studies anti-vaccination beliefs, called Kennedy Jr's appointment, if true, terrible. \"Even if the commission doesn't find anything (they won't),\" he wrote in an email to Science of Us, \"people will likely hear about it and infer that something must have been up in order for the government to investigate.\" In other words, the Trump administration may be dealing [another blow](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/trumps-climate-change-answer-dumber-than-you-could-imagine.html) to scientific facts.
