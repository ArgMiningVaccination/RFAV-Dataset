Essential oils are not only great for calming your nerves, but they are also ideal for relieving an entire host of ailments from upset stomachs to skin conditions. Essential oils have been used for hundreds of years and are naturally derived from plants, so there are few, if any, side effects.

Lemon oil is also useful for soothing a sore throat when added to hot water. - Clary sage: In the past, clary sage was used to treat vision problems. Today, you can use it to improve circulation, regulate hormones, lower stress levels and relieve symptoms of menopause. - Myrrh: A powerful antioxidant, myrrh is often added to beauty products to help maintain healthy skin. It's also useful for preventing infections and is recognized for its anti-parasitic, antifungal and even anti-cancer benefits. - Rosemary: Rosemary oil is a stimulant and has been shown to increase heart rate, blood pressure and brain activity when inhaled. However, it also decreases cortisol levels in the body, which can diminish stress. - Cinnamon: While cinnamon oil smells invigorating, the scent can help clear up chest colds and topical application can relieve muscle aches and pain. It can also be used to increase circulation, decrease inflammation and fend off free radicals. If your busy lifestyle doesn't allow you time to apply or integrate essential oils into your routine, try a diffuser. A diffuser is much like a humidifier in that it adds moisture back into the air but with the additional benefits of essential oil. While at home, you can simply add your oil of choice to the diffuser and switch it on to reap its positive effects.
