We systematically inves tigated whether MMR can induce long-term functional changes in innate immune cells, a process termed trained immunity, that could at least partially mediate this heterologous protection. In a randomized placebo -controlled trial, 39 healthy adults received either the MMR vaccine or a placebo. 40 By using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we found that MMR caused transcriptomic changes in CD14 - positive monocytes and NK cells, but most profoundly in T cells. Surprisingly, monocyte function was not altered by MMR va ccination. In contrast, the function of T cells was significantly enhanced by MMR vaccination, with higher production of TNF and IFN, as well as upregulation of cellular metabolic pathways. In conclusion, we describe a new trained immunity program char acterized by 45 modulation of T cell function induced by MMR vaccination. 50 One -sentence summary : 125 characters including spaces MMR vaccinatio n induces cellular and metabolic reprogramming in T cells towards a more active phenotype. 55 preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

However, an accumulating body of evidence 60 suggests that certain live-attenuated vaccines provide a broad spectrum of protection against heterologous infections as well ( non-specific beneficial effects ; NSEs) (1, 2) . Vaccine -induced NSEs are accompanied by epigenetic and metabolic changes in innate immune cells, also known as trained immunity (3-6). Recent studies suggest that induction of trained immunity is a n attractive strategy to boost broad protection against infections and as anti -cancer therapy ( 7). Most of the studies aiming to 65 study trained immunity induced by vaccines in humans have used the tuberculosis vaccine Bacille Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG ) (8-10), while very little is known about the effects of other vaccines on innate immune cells . Although there is ample epidemiological evidence that other live attenuated vaccines also have NSEs (2), their potential effects on innate immune cells have not been studied . 70 Measles containing vaccines (MCVs) are one such group of vaccine s associated with beneficial heterologous effects ( 11). Measles vaccines are routinely used in childhood immunization programs worldwide and were recently re -confirmed to be safe and effective (12). MMR vaccine is compos ed of a live-attenuated negative stranded measles virus, combined with mumps and rubella, and provides life-long immunity against measles after two doses. Several studies have confirmed higher child 75 survival and lower morbidity after measles immunization, independent of measles -attributable disease (13, 14). This suggests that MMR induces trained immunity that can provide broad heterologous protection (15, 16). Here, we assess the potential of MMR vaccination to induce trained immunity against SARS -CoV-2 and a range of other microbial stimuli. We used single -cell multi-'omics approaches to compare cellular heterogeneity in a randomized placebo -controlled trial of MMR re -vaccination in 80 Dutch adults. Surprisingly , we found that MMR vaccination caused transcriptomic and functional changes in T cells, rather than monocytes. This suggests that T cells might have a key role in the mechanisms underlying MMR -induced trained immunity. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Briefly, thirty -nine healthy adults ( 19 female and 20 male) were randomly assigned to receive either the MMR vaccine or a placebo . All participants were between 18 and 50 years of age and there were no significant 90 differences in sex, age, or BMI between the vaccination arms ( Fig. S1; Table S1 ). Peripheral venous blood was collected to conduct immunological analyses was collected immediately before vaccination and one month later. No infections occurred between visits or at least two weeks prior to the baseline measurement. 95 Circulating biomark ers of inflammation after MMR vaccinat ion Previous studies have shown that trained immunity induced by BCG increases the responsiveness of innate immune cells upon rechallenge , but reduces systemic inflammation during homeostasis (8). We sought to investigate if this is also the case after MMR vaccination. To that end, we used Proximity Extension Assa y technology (Olink) to assess targeted proteomics biomarkers (which have previously 100 been related to inflammation, oncology, neurology, or cardiometabolic function) before and after MMR vaccination ( Fig. 1B). There were no major changes in plasma proteome composition between the baseline measurement and 1 month after vaccination. Of all analyzed parameters (1289 after quality control) , only 4 met our selected cutoffs for log2 fold change > 0.5 and un adjusted p -value < 0.05. These were PPY (a pancreatic prot ein associated with counter -regulation of gastric 105 emptying( 17)), S100A12 (a calcium-binding alarmin protein( 18)), TMPRSS15 (a peptidase (19)), and CALCA ( a vasodilating peptide hormone involved in calcium regulation and thought to also function as a neurotransmitter (20)). We subsequently assessed the proteins that met the statistical significance threshold, independently of the fold change (Fig. 1C-F). Of the protein subcategories , the inflammation -related proteins showed 110 the highest number of changes , with a trend towards upregulation after vaccination (Fig. 1C). preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Among the other enriched proteins were factors related to NK cell and T cell activities ( IL- most suggestive hits were also related to immunological processes either directly (GP2, CST6, NCAM1, MARCO) or indirectly 115 (GH1). The proteins significantly changes in the oncology panel (Fig. 1E) were similarly enriched for immunologically relevant proteins (S100A12, PQBP1, CCL8, FCGR2B) , with a towards . Finally, in the neurology panel ( Fig. 1F) there was also an upregulation of immunology -related proteins such as CCL2, VSTM1, and PLA 2G10. These results indicate that inflammation -related proteins tend to be upregulat ed in the circulation after MMR vaccination , 120 although the effect size is relatively limited. However , in terms of the effects of MMR vaccination on the systemic inflammatory status, this differs significantly from the inhibitory effects exerted by BCG vaccination. We then considered the effects of MMR vaccination on circulating leukocyte counts ( Fig. 1G). MMR vaccination, but not placebo treatment, significantly increased (p = 0.04) the number of circulating 125 leukocytes after one month, although there was a large inter -individual variation. This change appeared to be driven mainly by an increase in myeloid cells (neutrophils and monocytes), although the comparison did not reach statistical significance for the individual cell types. Together, our results show that MMR -vaccinated individuals present with slightly increased systemic inflammation one month after vaccination . 130 Transcriptome effects in monocytes and T cells after MMR vaccination We decided to further investigate the effects of MMR vaccination on the composition and cellular states of circulating leukocytes . To that end, we performed single- cell (sc)ATAC -seq and scRNA -seq on peripheral blood mononuclear of a subset of participants. For scATAC -seq, we selected 135 12 participants from both the placebo and MMR-treated groups. We then selected half of t hose preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

An integrated analysis of both scRNA-seq and scATAC -seq data (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2A-B ) based on marker genes enabled us to identify 13 cell types within the PBMC fraction (Fig. S2C) . Since the white blood 140 cell differential ( Fig. 1G) suggested there might be changes in the PBMC composition, we leveraged the single -cell datasets to investigate this in more detail. Indeed , we observed intra -individual shifts in PBMC composition between timepoints ( Fig. , Fig. S3A). However, w e did not observe any consistent changes in either the MMR or placebo group ( Fig. 2B, S3A-B ). Although the low number of participants hindered statistical comparisons , our data suggest that it is unlikely that MMR vaccination ha s a major 145 influence on PBMC compositi on one month after vaccination . Previous studies have shown that vaccination with other live-attenuated vaccines such as BCG induces transcriptional and functional changes (trained immunity) in innate immune cells such as monocytes (21, 22) . We therefore hypothesized that although the PBMC composition was not altered by MMR vaccination, changes in monocyte transcriptional and functional programs could account for its known 150 NSEs , and possibly also for our observation that MMR increases systemic inflammation. We thus assessed the transcriptional effects of MMR and placebo between timepoints, across different cell types. In every cell type except CD4+ T cells, MMR vaccination had a more pronounced tr anscriptional effect than placebo administration (Fig. 2C; top panel). Indeed, CD14+ monocytes and NK cells, classical executors of BCG -induced trained immunity, were prominently influenced by MMR. Surprisingly 155 however, T cells were the most strongly af fected cells at transcriptional level among all assessed cell types . Cell-type specific analysis of differentially accessible genes revealed the chromatin to be impacted by MMR vaccination only in CD14+ monocytes (Fig. 2C; bottom panel) . MMR has on the transcriptome and epigenome of monocyte subpopulations Exploring further the monocyte sequencing data, we found different subpopulations defined by their 160 transcriptional or open-chromatin signatures. Among them, we found a subpopulation highly expressing HLA genes and another one upregulating alarmins, in both data layers ( Fig. 3A ).

Investigating the transcriptional changes induced by MMR, we identified more than 20 differentially expressed genes (adjusted p-value < 0.05) and 7 genes with changed chromatin accessibility ( Fig. S 4C). Upregulated 165 genes were enriched in pathways associated with response to mechanical stimulation or exposure to metals such as calcium (FOS, FOSB , JUN, JUNB and NFKBIA). moderately affected at the transcriptional level by MMR vaccination, these cells were not explicitly more pro -inflammatory during homeostasis . 170 Cytokine production capacity of PBMCs after MMR vaccination Innate immune memory is defined as the long-term functional reprogramming of inn ate immune cells by a first stimulation, leading to an altered response towards re -stimulation . To investigate functional immune responses after MMR vaccination or placebo, w e stimulated PBMCs for 24 hours with a variety of bacterial (LPS, by . We measured TNF, IL -6, and IL -1RA for all stimuli. Additionally, we measured IP10 and IFN specifically for the viral stimulations. We calculated log2 -transformed fold changes corrected for age, sex, and BMI between one month after vaccination and baseline measurements , and statistically compared placebo t reatment to MMR vaccination (Fig. 3B -H). We observed large intra - 180 and inter -individual variation s in cytokine responses between baseline and one month after treatment. However, there were no significant differences between placebo and MMR for any measured cytokine across all stimuli . Thus, we found no differences in PBMC cytokine production capacity after MMR vaccination . As monocytes are the main producers of the measured cytokine s in PBMCs during 24 - hour stimulations , this suggest s that monocyte cytokine secretion capacity is not changed by MMR 185 vaccination .

The copyright holder for this this version posted November 25, 2022. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.24.516894doi: bioRxiv preprint 8 Because the most prominent changes in response to MMR were seen in T cells according to the scRNA -seq data ( Fig.2 ), in the next set of experiments we assessed whether vaccination changed the 190 transcriptional and functional programs of these cells . A closer look into the T cell subpopulations revealed differences in their trans criptional and open -chromatin dynamics. Transcriptionally, two distinct subpopulations were found, one characterized by transcription of granzyme genes, and the other by upregulation of IL7R ( Fig. 4A ; left ). Integrating open -chromatin landscape with their transcriptional profiles from the same individuals led to differentiating V1 (higher in GZMB and 195 GZMH) and V2 (higher in GZMK) T cell populations (Fig. 4A; right ). Notably, the vaccination did not affect the proportion of the subpopulations identified ( Fig. S 5A-B ). Interestingly however, MMR induced a metabolic shift in T cells at the transcriptional level, with downregulation of genes involved in cellular respiration and ATP synthesis investigated the functional consequences for V2 T cells (the 200 most abundant -T cell population in the blood) by flow cytometry. There was a small but significant decrease in V2 T cells present in the PBMC fraction of MMR - vaccinated individuals (p = 0.0425) ; a pattern that was not present in the placebo controls (Fig. 5A) . On the other hand, we did not find any significant differences in relative abundance of subpopulations expressi ng CD27 and/or CD45RA, indicating MMR did not have strong effects on classical memory -V2 205 T cell formation (Fig. S6A) . There were also no changes in the expressions of CTLA4, PD1, LAG3, and TIM3 , markers that are commonly associated with T cell dysfunction or exhaustion . Notably , following stimulation of the T cell receptor using anti-CD3/anti -CD28 beads, the percentage (but not the mean fluorescence intensity [ MFI]) of V2 T cells positive for TNF or IFN increased ( Fig. 5B, Fig. S6B ). This indicates that th e T cell population has become more responsive towards secondary stimulation , a 210 feature resembling the classical monocyte trained immunity . Unstimulated V2 T cells showed a trend towards lower expression of the degranulation marker CD 107a after MMR vaccination (Fig. S6C) ; this effect was not present in CD3/CD28-stimulated V2 T cells , which showed no difference between timepoints in the percentage of cells staining positive for CD107a, g ranzyme B, or perforin (Fig. 5C). preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The copyright holder for this this version posted November 25, 2022. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.24.516894doi: bioRxiv preprint 9 These data suggest that granule release by V2 cells is more tightly regulated at baseline following 215 MMR vaccination, but that th is effector function is not weaker following stimulation . The single- cell analyses revealed that unstimulated T cells modulate genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation ( Fig. 4B -C). Therefore, we determined the functional metabolism profile of V2 T cells before and after MMR vaccination using SCENITH ( 23)). This flow cytometry- based technique uses puromycin incorporation as a proxy for p rotein synthesis activity, which in itself reflects a significant 220 portion of total ATP used by the cell . Briefly, w e measured protein synthesis levels ( puromycin MFI; Fig. 5D ) upon treatment with This allowed us to calculate 5H ) of V2 T cells . These experiments revealed a trend towards higher protein synthesis activity (p = 0.203) in unstimulated V2 T cells following MMR vaccination. The same 225 pattern was visible following stimulation with isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP, a common antigen specifically for V2 T cells; p = 0.129), and was statistically significant following CD3/CD28 stimulation (p = 0.00391). The metabolic processes fueling this change remained unclear however, as only CD3/CD28 -stimulated V2 T cells had changed metabolic parameters: a decrease in glycolytic capacity and thus a concomitant increased dependence on mitochondrial energy metabolism. In conclusion, 230 these data show , for the first time , transcriptional and functional changes consistent with induction of trained immunity in T cell s following MMR vaccination. DISCUSSION Trained immunity entails the process of boosting innate immune function following vaccination or 235 infection ( 4), and this process has been proposed to mediate at least in part the heter ologous protective effects of live attenuated vaccines such as BCG or MMR. While extensive studies have documented induction of trained immunity by BCG (including but not limited to ( 3, 5, 6, 8-10, 22, 24, 25)), nothing is known regarding the capacity of MMR vaccination to induce trained immunity. We performed a randomized, placebo -controlled trial investigating the potential of the MMR v accine to 240 preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Using single- cell multi -omics transcriptional and epigenetic analysis combined with functional immunological and metabolic assays, we show that MMR vaccination induces a trained immunity phenotype in T cells, while it has limited effects on monocyte function . Most studies on the heterologous protection induced by certain vaccines such as BCG or influenza have 245 focused on the induction of trained immunity in myeloid cells ( 3, 26). MMR vaccination has beneficial heterologo us effects on overall mortality in children, therefore, we hypothesized that it also induces trained immunity. MMR induced some modest changes in the chromatin accessibility and transcriptional programs of monocytes, related to cellular responses to metal ions (specifically calcium; upregulated) and cellular adhesion (downregulated). However, these transcriptional effects did not 250 result in significant effects on monocyte -derived cytokine production, despite the well -known role of calcium-dependent signalin g in the function of immune cells (27-29). Future studies should be conducted to analyze in more depth the role of these pathways i n monocytes after MMR vaccination, and if these changes are functionally relevant. 255 Instead, we discovered that MMR induced much stronger transcriptomic and functional changes in the innate lymphoid population of T cells . In this respect, MMR vaccination modulated the expression of genes involved in aerobic energy metabolism. We sought to functionally validate these findings and therefore closely examined V2 T cells, the most abundant T cell subpopulation in human peripheral blood . MMR vaccination preceded a significant increase in the proportion of V2 T cells producing TNF 260 and IFN, and these cells were more metabolically active , especially after CD3/CD28 stimulation. Our findings indicate that T cells have a more activated phenotype in MMR -vaccinated individuals, providing a plausible mechanistic explanation for the NSEs conferred by MMR. Because of their non-canonical antigen -recognition mechanisms, the exact receptors and pathways 265 that trigger the effects of MMR vaccination on T cell transcriptome and function remain to be preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Previous g ene expression and functional analyses demonstrate that T cells have hybrid innate - and adaptive immune functions ; the single-cell transcriptome o f these cells has similarities to both CD8+ T cells and NK cells ( 30). Their innate- like features encompass the ability to mediate antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity, phagocytos e pathogens, and direct rapid non - 270 specific responses against threats (31). On the other hand , classic adaptive features include somatic recombination of their functional T cell receptor, memory cell formation , and professional antigen - presenting capabilities (32). Unlike classical T -cell receptor signaling a ntigen -recognition by T cells is not MHC -restricted (33). V2 T cells, for example, 3A1 (( 34)), and tetanus toxoid (35, 36) . In cancer immunology, T cells are known to exert strong anti -tumor effects by the release of pro -inflammatory cytokines, granzymes, perforin and via activation of apoptosis-triggering receptors (36), although pro -tumo r effects have also been described (( 37)). Interestingly, previous studies have suggested that IFN - producing T cells are more dependent on glycolysis than on oxidative metabolism (38), whereas our 280 analyses show increased reliance on mitochondrial metabolism and simultaneously an increase in IFN -producing V2 T cells. This contrast could potential ly be explained by the differences in used models: our study uses human samples rather than mice, and the previous work was done in a cancer model . Future studies need to confirm our results and assess the full array of pathways and functional consequence s induced by MMR on T cells. 285 Our data have several practical and theoretical implications. On the one hand , the differences between the BCG -induced (myeloid -dependent) and MMR-induced (lymphoid-dependent) trained immunity programs demonstrate that different vaccines can induce different types of innate immune memory . Remarkably, even when considering effects on lymphoid cells with innate properties, a major 290 difference emerges between MMR -induced effects on T cells rather than BCG effects on NK ce lls. On the other hand , demonstrating that MMR is also able to induce trained immunity could lead to the preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Indeed, MMR has been proposed as a potential approach to prevent COVID19 in the period before the SARS-CoV -2 specific vaccines were available ( 39, 40) . In a 295 case -control study during a recent measles outbreak, a reduced COVID19 incidence was detected in men vaccinated with MMR ( 41). Not only induction of trained immunity has been proposed as a mechanism explaining the heterologous effects of MMR on COVID -19. An inverse correlation between COVID -19 disease severity 300 and MMR -specific IgG -titers was found in adults in the United States ( 42). A potential explanation for this observation could lie in cross -reactivity against structurally similar components of SARS -CoV-2 and MMR epitopes, which was described by Marakosova et al ( 43, 44) . However, this cannot account for the entire breadth of protection offered by MMR vaccines and these studies did no t investigate the potential impact of MMR on innate immune cells. 305 Our study also has some limitations. First, the sample size was limited due to the exploratory nature of this investigation, which barred us from investigating the host and environmental f actors that impact these effects of MMR vaccination . Future research should encompass an increased number of participants and a broader range of study parameters such as microbiome constituents, epigenetic 310 histone modifications, and more follow -up timepoin ts, similar to the large-scale vaccination studies performed with BCG (8, 25). Second, w hile NK cell activation related inflammatory proteins were increased in the serum of MMR -vaccinated individuals, we could not substantiate this finding with functional NK cell experiments due to limitations in the cell numbers available . Third , it is unknown which MMR components trigger ed T cell activation, or if the y reacted for example upon interaction 315 with other activated cells . Moreover, in this study we in fact re -vaccinated adults who had previously received the MMR vaccine as part of the Dutch national vaccination program. Future studies should investigate if primary MMR vaccination has similar effects. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

The immunological and metabolic cellular responses to MMR reveal T cells as a novel population of innate -like cells that mediate trained immunity. Our findings warrant further research to investigate the possibility that T cells activation may be a component of trained immunity programs of other vaccines as well , and to assess the potential to improve vaccine efficacy by inducing these effects . 325 preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Therefore, participants were 1:1 allocated to receive either a placebo vaccination (0.1 ml of 0.9% saline solution), or an MMR vaccination (SD, 0.5 ml, live attenuated mumps virus [ strain 'Jeryl Lynn', at least rubella virus [ 27/3', at least 1 * 10^3 CCID50 ]). Vaccination was performed intramuscularly in the right upper arm 710 and. Blood was drawn at baseline (\"T1\") and one month after vaccination (\"T2\") . The trial protocol registered under NL74082.091.20 in the Dutch trial registry, was approved in 2020 by the Arnhem - Nijmegen Ethics Committee. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and no adverse events were recorded. 715 Study s ubjects Thirty -nine healthy volunteers (Table S1 ) within the age of 18 and 50 years, were recruited between June and September 2020. Subj ects with a medical history associated with immunodeficiency or a solid or non -solid malignancy within the two preceding years were excluded. Vaccination three months prior to the start of the study or plans to receive other vaccinations during the study p eriod was not allowed. 720 Acute illness within two weeks before study initiation or the use of drugs, including non -steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) less than four weeks before the start of the trial, with the exception of oral contraceptives, also resulted in exclusion. Pregnant subjects were not eligible. All participants gave written informed consent. 725 Blood collection and sample processing EDTA whole blood (8 x 10 ml) was collected via venipuncture. Two of the EDTA tubes were centrifuged immedia tely after collection at 2970 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT) and plasma was preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Hematological parameters such as white blood cell count and differential were measured on a Sysmex XN -450 apparatus. Additionally, 1 ml of whole blood was 730 stored at -80 \u00b0C for genotyping analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by density -gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque. Briefly: EDTA blood was diluted in PBS and layered on Ficoll- Paque solution. After centrifugation for 30 minutes at 615 x g (no brakes ; RT) , the PBMC layer was collected and washed at least 3 times with cold calcium/magnesium -free PBS. The cells were 735 resuspended in RPMI-1640 modifications (Invitrogen) and counted by Sysmex. For cytokine production assessments, PBMCs were seeded in round -bottom 96 well plates at 0.5 * 10 6 cells/well. The cells were stimulated for 24 hours using the stimuli described in Table S3 (all in the presence of 10% human pooled serum, at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2). Supernatants were collected and stored 740 at -20 \u00b0C until further analysis. PBMC freezing and thawing Leftover PBMCs were resuspended in ice -cold, heat -inactivated DMSO in FBS was added dropwise to the cells until a final concentration 745 of 10% DMSO was reached. The cells were stored for up to 24 hours in Co olCell alcohol -free freezing containers (Corning) at -80 \u00b0C, after which they were transferred to a -150 \u00b0C freezer for long -term storage. For subsequent experiments, PBMCs were thawed following a protocol modified from H\u00f8nge et al (45). The PBMCs were retrieved from the -150 \u00b0C storage and kept on dry ice until the moment of thawing. 750 The cells were rapidly warmed in a water bath of 37 \u00b0C until only a small clump of ice was present in the vial. The contents were immediately transferred into a 10x volume of pre-warmed thawing medium (RPMI supplemented as described 20% FBS 12.5 \u00b5g/ml DNase -I).

The cells were again centrifuged, resuspended in cold PBS and counted with 755 trypan blue to assess recovery and viability. ELISA cytokine measurements and dat a analysis The cytokines TNF (commonly referred to as TNF -), IL -6, IL -1Ra, and IP -10 were measured using DuoSet ELISA kits from R&D systems, and IFN with a kit from PBL Assay Science, using the 760 manufacturer's protocol. To account for plate- to-plate variation, the participants were randomiz ed over different plates (timepoints were kept together on the same plate). Cytokine concentrations were calculated relative to the standard curve in Gen5 software (BioTek) . Log2 -fold changes were calculated between T2 and T1, and corrected for sex, age, and BMI using a linear regression approach. The MMR and placebo groups were compared using Mann -Whitney U tests. 765 Targeted proteomics analysis by p roximity extension assay Plasma samples from 16 MMR -vaccinated individuals were sent to Olink (Sweden) for targeted proteomics analysis using proximity extension assay technology . In total, 1472 proteins were measured, of which 183 were removed from the an alysis due to them being poorly detectable in >25% 770 of samples (30 cardiometabolic proteins, 46 inflammatory proteins, 56 neurology proteins, 51 oncology proteins) . Unadjusted p -values were calculated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. DNA isolation and genotyping Whole blood samples were shipped on dry ice to the Human Genomics Facility of the Genetic 775 Laboratory of the Department of Internal Medicine at Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. There, DNA isolation was performed and samples w ere genotyped using library preparation and sequencing 780 preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Single cell gene expression libraries were generated on the 10x Genomics Chromium platform using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' Library & Gel Bead Kit v3.1 and Chromium Next GEM Chip G Single Cell Kit (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Single- cell ATAC -seq libraries were generated on the 10x Genomics Chromium platform using the Chromium Next GEM 785 Single Cell ATAC Library & Gel Bead Kit v1.1 and Chromium Next GEM Chip H Single Cell Kit (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene expression and ATAC -seq libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq ipeline used with default parameters. CellRanger count or CellRanger -atac count was used to align read data to the reference genome provided by 10x Genomics. In scRNA -seq, a digital gene 795 expression matrix was generated to record the number of UMIs for each gene in each cell. In snATAC - seq, fragment files were created. Each library was further demultiplexed by assigning cell barcodes to their donor. Souporcell (v1.3 gb) (46) w as used for genotype-free demultiplexing by calling candidate variants on the pre- mapped bam files. Cells were clustered by their allelic information and each cluster was matched to a donor with a 800 known genotype. scRNA -seq data analysis The expression matrix from each library was loaded to R/Seurat package (v3.2.2) (47) for downstream analysis. To control the data quality, we first excluded cells with ambiguou s assignments from 805 Souporcell demultiplex. Next, we further excluded low -quality cells with > 25% mitochondrial reads, < 100 or > 3,000 expressed genes, or > 5000 UMI counts. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The copyright holder for this this version posted November 25, 2022. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.24.516894doi: bioRxiv preprint 32 After QC, we applied LogNormalization (Seurat function) and scaled the data, regressing for total UMI counts, number of features, percentage of mitochondrial genes and percentage of ribosomal genes. 810 We then performed principal component analysis (PCA) based on the 2,000 more highly variable features identified using the vst method implemented in Seurat. As batches showed a good integration of the data, no integration algorithm was applied. Cells were then clustered using the Louvain algorithm with a resolution of 0.75 based on neighbors calculated the first 30 principal components. For visualization, we applied UMAP based on the first 30 principal components. 815 Annotation of scRNA-seq clusters Clusters were annotated by manually checking the expression of known marker genes. Cluster 5 showed a higher expression of gamma and delta chain genes ( TRGC1 , TRDC ), along with Performing dimensionality reduction and clustering on this two mixed 820 populations: MAIT cells overexpressing KLRB1 and T cells over expressing TRDC /TRGC , these cells were then annotat ed accordingly. Differential gene expression and gene -set enrichment For paired comparison between timepoints in both MMR and placebo, differential expression (DE) 825 tests were performed using the FindMarkers functions in Seurat with MAST (48). Patient ids were regressed out, in order to perform a paired analysis. Genes with a Bonferroni-corrected P-value < 0.05 were regarded as differentially expressed. Gene -set enrichment was performed using the enrichGO function from the R package clusterProfil er. Gene -sets enriched with a Benjamin-Hochberg corrected p -value below 0.05 and more than 4 genes 830 were considered significant. snATAC -seq data analysis preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Cells with fewer than 1,000 unique fragments, a transcription start site 835 enrichment below 4, identified as doublets by ArchR, or ambiguously labelled by souporcell were removed. After QC, we used the ArchR function 'addIterativeLSI' to process iterative latent semantic indexing using the top 25,000 variable features and top 30 dimensions. For visualization, we applied UMAP with nNeighbors = 30 and minDist = 0.5. 840 Gene scores were calculated for each cell based on accessibility. In order to aid the analysis of gamma - delta T c ells, a modified reference was used. Adding the gtf gene reference used by CellRanger, gene scores could be data 845 ArchR function 'addGeneIntegrationMatrix' was used to compare the calculated snATAC -seq gene score matrix and the measured gene expression in scRNA -seq data. This resulted in a matched scRNA profile and predicted cell type per sequenced cell in the snATAC -seq data. Cell types were therefore assigned to the snATAC -seq data based on the predicted cell type of the integration. UMAPs of the integrated blocks were inspected in order to examine the quality of the integration ( Fig. S2A -B). 850 Per cell type analysis of snATAC -seq data A common approach was followed to inspect the open -chromatin changes in each cell type. The same method as described before for the whole cell pool was used for visualization and clustering separately in each cell type. After, open-chromatin peaks were calculated by running 'addReproduci blePeakSet' 855 using Macs2 algorithm (50). Transcription factor motif deviations were calculated based on the 'CIS - BP' database annotation (51) using the 'addDeviationsMatrix' function.

FDR < 0.05 was indicative of significant changes. 860 Flow cytometry measurements of T cell parameters The flow cytometry staining w as performed as follows: 5x105 thawed PBMCs were stained for surface markers using the antibodies described in Table S 3, for 30 minutes in the dark at 4 \u00b0C, in FACS buffer (PBS , 5% FBS, 2 mM EDTA Intracellular permeabilisation Cytofix permeabilization/fixation reagent (BD washes with Cytofix permeabilization/washing buffer (BD biosciences), the cells were stained with the antibodies against intracellular markers detailed in Table S3 , for 30 minutes in the dark at 4 \u00b0C. After completion of the staining procedure, t he cells were washed with PBS and stored in CellFIX reagent (BD biosciences) until acquisition on a (BD bios ciences). 870 The was in FlowJo (vX.07). The gating strategy was as follows: events corresponding to lymphocyte size were selected based on FSC -A/SSC-A, followed by selection of single- cell events in subsequent FSC-H/FSC-A and FSC -W/FSC -A gates. Viable cells were selected by gating on viability-dy e-negative cells. The analyses were performed on CD45+CD3+V2+ cells. 875 For measurement of surface markers on unstimulated V2 T cells, the thawed PBMC were stained as described above immediately after thawing. For measurements of cytokine expression or surface markers after stimulation, the PBMCs were first treated with soluble anti-CD3/anti -C28 (BD bioscience) for 4 hours in Golgi plug (Brefeldin A; BD bioscience) , under standard cell 880 SCENITH We modified the original SCENITHTM technique ( https://www.scenith.com) to analyze energy metabolism of T cells. Briefly, PBMCs we re plated at 0.3x106 cells/well in 96 -well plates. The cells 885 preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Cells were then untreated (control) or treated with 2 -DG (final concentration 100 mM), Oligomycin (O, final concentration 10 M) and combination of 2 -DG and Oligomycin (DGO, final concentration 100 mM and 10 M) for 30 min under standard cell culture conditions . Following addition of puromycin (final concentration 10 \u00b5g/ml) , the cells were incubated 890 for an additional 45 minut es. The cells were subsequently harvested and washed in cold FACS buffer before being stained as described above. Statistical analysis and software All data was analyzed in R as described in each relevant section of the methods. Unless otherwise 895 indicate d, two -tailed p-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
