Panchakarma. Panchakarma is Ayurveda's purification and rejuvenation method and therapeutic means of eliminating bodily and mental impurities. It is designed to remove deep-rooted stress and impurities while balancing the doshas - those energies or life forces that govern all biological functions. The main essence of Ayurveda is to live life to its fullest with good health at all levels. With our Panchakarma (detox) program, you can cleanse yourself from several elements of emotions, including those of fear, anger, jealousy, and sadness, among others. All such emotions, when unchecked, can store up in a person's body system, which is practically unsafe as it can trigger physical and emotional imbalance for years & years. When left untreated, we release such old forms of behavior that we uncontrollably find ourselves revisiting them repeatedly. At AyurRoots Wellness Center- we have designed programs to help cleanse and burn off such underlying issues. This will help burn unwanted elements of dark emotions and completely detoxify all the conserved toxins that hide in the body system. Why Detoxify and Cleanse?
