The financial terms of the license agreement were not disclosed. Baylor researchers have already been working in the area of oncolytic viral therapies against a wide variety of solid tumors, but this in-licensed therapy reportedly represents Baylor's most advanced viral therapy to date, having shown safety and strong efficacy in a number of preclinical animal tumor models. Immusol plans to file an \"The recent approval of the first oncolytic viral therapy for head and neck cancer by the Chinese state food and drug administration, together with the increasing number of clinical trials for oncolytic viral therapies worldwide signal the coming of age of oncolytic viral therapy as a new and important modality for cancer treatment,\" says Dr. Flossie Wong-Staal, Immusol's CSO and executive vice president of research and development. \"We believe that the Baylor oncolytic viral therapy has significant advantages over many other oncolytic viruses, including higher potency and efficacy in metastatic tumors.\" \"The recent approval of the first oncolytic viral therapy for head and neck cancer by the Chinese state food and drug administration, together with the increasing number of clinical trials for oncolytic viral therapies worldwide signal the coming of age of oncolytic viral therapy as a new and important modality for cancer treatment,\" says Dr. Flossie Wong-Staal, Immusol's CSO and executive vice president of research and development. \"We believe that the Baylor oncolytic viral therapy has significant advantages over many other oncolytic viruses, including higher potency and efficacy in metastatic tumors.\" There are challenges before Immusol can even get to human trials, though, much less a commercial product. Wong-Staal says that producing a virus is much more difficult than making a chemical compound, and the six-month minimum that is anticipated for initial production is the key limiting factor that could keep the company out of clinics until the end of this year.
