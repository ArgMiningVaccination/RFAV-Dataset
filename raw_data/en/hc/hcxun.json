In that case, you're probably aware that conventional medical care doesn't always utilize the full spectrum of treatments and medications available for a specific condition. While these non-medicinal approaches have historically been referred to as \"alternative medicine,\" these complementary approaches can be very helpful in supporting treatment for a wide range of health concerns. Although these medicinal approaches and theories haven't always been available through your regular doctor or provider, today's healthcare organizations are more committed than ever to using these practices as part of a more holistic and [successful approach to patient care](https://www.flaglersignatureplus.com). This approach is known as integrative medicine. What is Integrative Medicine? Instead of forcing patients to choose between either conventional medicine or complementary practices, integrative medicine combines these two approaches to provide patients with the best healthcare services and care possible. In many cases, doctors will use integrative medicines and treatments to support conventional medicine or provide care and support where traditional medicines aren't an option for that patient. \"Doctors still rely on evidence-based interventions when choosing which complementary approaches to integrate into their care. But as research backing up these integrative methods grows, doctors have more options when building treatment plans that offer the best care and support for their patients.\" Says Dr. Mark Moon of Signature+ Concierge Care. Although any patient may benefit from integrated medicine to complement traditional medicinal approaches, individuals with chronic or complex health conditions may be particularly well-positioned to benefit from this hybridized approach to healthcare and wellness. Types of Integrative Medicine Integrative medicine can use several different types of complementary medicines and therapies in combination with traditional medicine and treatment. These integrative approaches may include, but are not limited to, the following: Natural supplements and dietary changes. This can include herbal supplements, vitamins, and probiotics. It may also include specialized diets, such as those built around anti-inflammatory foods. Mind-body therapies. These therapies can range from meditation to yoga and support mental health and the mind-body relationship, such as how a patient experiences and manages pain. Bodywork. Acupuncture, massage, and other forms of bodywork may offer evidence-based interventions for various health issues, from musculoskeletal pain to mental health issues. Animal-assisted therapy. Using animals within an integrated care framework can help patients cope with pain, loneliness, and other mental health complications resulting from their physical ailments. Patient Benefits of Integrative Medicine While individual experiences and benefits may vary, patients interested in an integrated approach to care may enjoy the following: Evidence-based support for complex health conditions. Integrative medicine can open up your access to treatments and interventions that improve your physical comfort and your ability to manage and overcome certain health conditions. The oversight of a healthcare provider can help ensure that integrative approaches are properly incorporated into your existing care. Greater choice in building a treatment plan. Complex health conditions may create certain restrictions about what treatments and interventions are available to a patient\u2014mainly if more than one health concern is present. Advanced integrative medicine can create more opportunities to incorporate multiple interventions without raising the risk of new complications. Relief for primary symptoms. Many integrated medicine treatments aim to address symptoms associated with several health conditions, including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headaches, inflammation, and pain. What to Consider Before Choosing Integrative Medicine Conflicting guidance for medical interventions. While your primary healthcare provider can help you navigate potential conflicts in care recommendations, you may be forced to choose between conventional and complementary treatments with limited research and expert guidance to inform your decision. The complexity of your existing treatment plan. Integrative medicine brings in new treatments and potential new providers, depending on the interventions you need. For individuals whose care plan is already complex and overwhelming, the mental health toll of further complications may not be worth the potential benefits. The risk of potential complications. While uncommon for individuals receiving integrated care through a healthcare provider, there is always a risk that integrative treatments will bring unwanted and unexpected side effects. No guarantee of benefits. Even if an integrated approach doesn't introduce new complications or health concerns, it's also possible that a more complex treatment plan informed by complementary techniques may fail to deliver a different outcome than conventional treatments alone.
