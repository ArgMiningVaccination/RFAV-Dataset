The federal government purchased a large supply of COVID-19 vaccines that is predicted to last through the summer of 2023. COVID-19 vaccines will remain free to all people, even if they don't have insurance, while the national vaccine supply lasts. After the federal vaccine supply runs out: - COVID-19 vaccinations will continue to be free for children in Washington - COVID-19 vaccinations for adults will be covered by most private insurance, Medicare (\"Apple Health\"), and Medicaid/CHIP - People who are uninsured will be able to get free COVID-19 vaccinations at certain local pharmacies and community health centers Most forms of private health insurance must continue to pay for COVID-19 vaccines given by a health care provider in their network, without charging the patient. People with private health insurance may need to pay part of the cost if an out-of-network provider vaccinates them. [Community Health Centers](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/health/locations/community-health-centers.aspx) and [Public Health Centers](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/health/locations.aspx) have vaccinations for uninsured and underinsured people, if they enroll as patients. Our aim in King County is to efficiently and equitably vaccinate as many eligible King County residents as possible in order to suppress the spread of COVID-19 and minimize the impact of the pandemic on our community.
