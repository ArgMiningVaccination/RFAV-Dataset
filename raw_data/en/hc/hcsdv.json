SRU Soldier Mission My recovery is my fight. I will win my fight to recover as I heal and transition back to the fighting force or successfully into the community with dignity, respect and self-determination. [Soldier Recovery Unit's Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/jblm.wtb) About At the Soldier Recovery Unit (formerly the Warrior Transition Battalion or JBLM WTB) we take care of our nation's ill, injured and wounded Soldiers, providing them with outstanding medical care, advocacy, and leadership. Our goal is to ensure our Soldiers are treated with dignity, respect and compassion. The SRU at Joint Base Lewis-McChord is one of two battalions under Madigan Army Medical Center. Our mission as a medical treatment facility is to provide leadership, primary medical care, and nurse case management for Soldiers to establish conditions for their healing and to promote their timely return to the force or successful transitions to becoming civilian Veterans. To be successful in this mission, we implemented the triad of care concept, ensuring that each Soldier's nurse case manager, primary care manager (medical provider) and squad leader meet and communicate on an official basis to ensure the best possible transition. We also work with each Soldier to establish comprehensive transition plans, allowing them to create their own transition goals resourced by the SRU. Our innovative programs and comprehensive care continue to evolve to meet the physical, emotional, and intellectual health needs of our Soldiers of all components, whether they are active duty, Army National Guard or Army Reserve Soldiers. Our SRU staff is a diverse team of medical experts, social workers, leadership and more who work together to create a holistic healing environment for Soldiers. Our community-based warrior transition unit allows Soldiers to live with their Families and to receive local health care in communities not near Army medical facilities. These Soldiers are still assigned to the SRU, and receive regular support from their unit in managing their comprehensive care plan and accessing additional resources. We also share and partner with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other governmental agencies to enhance the care and service of Soldiers and Families both at the national and local level. At Joint Base Lewis-McChord, the SRU is involved with numerous community groups; these collaborations allow Soldiers and their Families additional fiscal, health, and outreach resources to enable them to heal.
