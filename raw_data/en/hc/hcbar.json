This guidance supports the planning, development and implementation of the curriculum for pupils with learning difficulties. It draws on effective practice across a range of schools and can be used in mainstream and special primary and secondary schools, specialised units and independent schools. It also provides support to the range of services that work withthese schools. The guidance can be used with the school's o wn material, the national curriculu m and the frameworks for teaching literacy and mathematics to: confirm the statutory entitlement to learning for all pupils and build on the principles of inclusion set out in the national curriculum help schools develop an inclusive curriculum by: - setting suitable learning challenges - responding to pupils' diverse learning needs - including all learners by overcoming potential barriers to learning and assessment provide a s timulus t o revisit and revise existing schemes of work or a basis to develop new ones. Who are the pupils? The guidance relates to all pupils aged between 5 and 16 who have learning difficulties, regardless of factors such as their ethnicity, culture, religion, home language, family background or gender, or the extent of their other difficulties. This includes pupils who are unlikely to achieve above level 2 at key stage 4. (These pupils are usually described as having severe or profound and multiple learning difficulties.) This also includes pupils with learning difficulties who may be working at age-related expectations in some subjects but are well below this in others. (These pupils, along with those with other significant difficulties, are often described as having moderate learning difficulties.) Who is the guidance for? The guidance supports the work of a range of adults who are concerned with meeting the needs of pupils with learn ing difficulties. This includes class teachers, subject coordinators, special educational needs coordinators (SENCos), senior managers, teaching assistants, parents,23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 2INTRODUCTION 3 carers, governors, therapists, local authority and advisory support services, and professionals from health, social services and the voluntary sector. Throughout these materials, the term 'staff' is used to refer to all those concerned with the education of these pupils. What is in the guidance? The guidance contains: support on developing and planning the curriculum support on developing skills across the curriculum subject materials on planning, teaching and a ssessing each national curri culum subject; religious education (RE); and personal, social and health education (PSHE) and citizenship. These include descriptions of pupils' attainment showing progress up to level 1 of the national curriculum, which can be used to recognise attainment and structure teaching. What are the subject materials? The subject materials support staff in planning appropriate learning opportunities. The materials do not represent a separate c urriculum for pupils with learning difficulties or an alternative to the national curriculum. They demonstrate a process for developing access to the national curriculum and support staff in developing their own curriculum to respond to the needs of their pupils at each key stage. The materials offer one approach to meeting this challenge. Schools may already have effective structures or may wish to adopt different approaches. The materials identify learning op portunities re levant to each subject. They demonstrate appropriate learning across the scope of the national curriculum from the earliest levels. They are intended to increase schools'confidence in their capacity to provide appropriate access to the national curriculum. A common framework for these materials has been used. In each subject, appropriate learning for pupils with diverse needs at each key stage has been identified. Those aspects of the programmes of study t hat may cr eate particular difficulties are also discussed, as well as aspects that may be unsuitable at a particular key stage. The suggested activities can be used to develop ideas for relevant, accessible and challenging experiences in curriculum plans.23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 34SCIENCE Responding to pupils' needs when teaching science The importance of science to pupils with learning difficulties Science gives all pupils the opportunity to think and learn, and develop an interest in, and curiosity about, the world around them through exploratory and investigative experiences and activities. In particular, science offers pupils with learning difficulties opportunities to: develop an awareness of, and interest in, themselves and their immediat e surroundings and environment join in practical activities that link to ideas, for example, doing and thinking use their senses to explore and investigate develop an understanding of cause and effect.In response to these opportunities, pupils can make progress in science by: experiencing that personal actions have consequences, leading to the seeking of explanations, and an understanding of the links between causes and effects increasing the breadth and dept h of their experience, knowledge and underst anding linking and applying scientific knowledge and understanding to everyday life, for example, to cooking, to their own health, in the use of materials for functional purposes investigating the familiar, and later developing a broader environmental and technological perspective developing an understanding of the more abstract as well as the concrete and practical moving from description to explanation of events and phenomena. Modifying the science programmes of study The statutory inclusion statement of the national curriculum requires staff to modify the programmes of study to give all pupils relevant and appropriately challenging work at each key stage. Staff should teach23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 4RESPONDING TO PUPILS' NEEDS WHEN TEACHING SCIENCE 5 knowledge, skills and understanding in ways that match and challenge their pupils' abilities. Staff can modify the science programmes of study for pupils with learning difficulties by: choosing material from earlier key stages maintaining, reinforcing, consolidating and generalising previous learning, as well as introducing new knowledge, skills and understanding using the programmes of study for science as a resource, or to provide a context, in planning lea rning appropriate to the age and needs of pupils focusing on one aspect, or a limited number of aspects, in depth or in outline, of the age-related programme of study including experiences which allow pupils at the early stages of learning to gain knowledge, skills and understanding in science as part of theirstudy of other subjects, or which take place as part of everyday activities, for example, choosing materials, investigations involving food and cooking enabling some pupils, at first, to access science by personal exploration using a sensory approach. Scientific enquiry PlanningPlanning involves anticipation, thinking about what might happen, anddeciding what action to take. It begins with the awareness that actions have consequences and that these are linked, for example, operating a switch to play music or move a toy. Anticipation can be encouraged by exaggerating and building-up a coming event, for example ,'Wait for it, wait f or it ...'. T aking part in the planning process for an investigation is made easier by offering alternatives, brainstorming ideas, and encouraging pupils to think about previous experiences and knowledge. Learning about planning through scientific enquiry across the key stages can help pupils to: respond to, and answer, scientific questions (at first it may be necessary for staff to give pupils examples of questions and ways of answering), leading to asking scien tific questions, for example, 'What will happen if did ...?'23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 56SCIENCE think and communicate about what might happen, try things out when deciding what to do, and choosing what equipment and materials to use decide what kind of evidence to collect, for example, surveys, measurement, observation, information know about the range of available sources of information, for example, asking people, looking at pictures, photographs, CD-ROMs and the internet learn about tests that are fair, and those that are not, by taking part in a variety of investiga tions involving fair and unfair tests. Obtainin gandpresentingevidence Obtaining evidence begins with the exploration and investigation of a range of living things, materials and phenomena, using the senses of sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste, as appropriate. Observation is indicatedinitially by attending, showing an interest in, and manipulating. Care needs to be taken to avoid confusion, and only a manageable amount of sensory input should be pr esented a t any one time. Learning how to obtain and pr esent evidence across the key stages can help pupils to: follow simple instructions to keep themselves and others safe, for example, 'Stop', 'No more', and learn to take action to control risks to themselves and others use a range of scientific equipment and materials, at first for play and exploration and then in a planned way make observations and measurements, becoming more systematic and accurate record what hap pens using a variety of means, forexamp le, remembering, using symbols to indicate to a member of staff, using sticky symbols on prepared graphs or tables present the evidence and explain what happened, for example, summing up using a variety of ways including concrete objects, three-dimensional models, photographs, symbols, tallies, drawings, diagrams, graphs, audio recorders, videos and other forms of ICT. Consideringandevaluatingevidence Considering and ev aluating e vidence begins with the demonstration of consisten t responses and using discrimination during a scientific activity, for example, choosing certain materials and rejecting others to indicate personal preference. Learning how to consider and evaluate evidenceacross the key stages can help pupils to:23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 6RESPONDING TO PUPILS' NEEDS WHEN TEACHING SCIENCE 7 use evidence for a purpose and recognise its relevance, for example, selecting fabrics for clothes to keep warm make simple comparisons and identify simple patterns or associations, for example, 'Which is the biggest?' 'Which is the fastest?' communicate 'What happened when...?' and begin to provide an explanation and compare what happened with what pupils expected, for example, using before/after photographs or video clips use observations, measurements or oth er data to draw conclusions, for example, after an investigation about freezing and melting, pupils might know and communicate where to put their ice lollipop to keep it frozen review their work and communicate it to others, for example, suggesting improvements for the next time. Life processes and living things HumansandotheranimalsKnowledge and understanding of humans and other animals starts withpupils' awareness of themselves, for example, body awareness and self- awar eness, and, at first, relates to personal experience, for example, food tasting and preferences, experiencing movement, exploring their own body parts and senses. It leads to a basic knowledge of how the human body works and how to keep healthy. Learning about humans and other animals across the key stages can help pupils to: recognise that animals, including humans, move, feed, grow, use their senses and reproduce treat animals with care and sensitivity recognise t he variety of foods to be included in a healthy diet and the need for a balanced diet observe and explore movement in themselves, other humans and animals, and know about the role of skeletons and muscle recognise that humans and other animals can produce offspring and that these grow into adults know about the main stages of the human life cycle, for example, babyhood, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, old age, death be aware that we breathe in and out, into the lungs, and that blood flows through the body23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 78SCIENCE recognise the need for personal hygiene and follow simple and safe routines to reduce the spread of bacteria explore different factors that contribute to a healthy lifestyle, including the choices pupils can make, for example, diet, exercise, effects of tobacco and alcohol, drugs as medicines, keeping food fresh. Green plants Knowledge and understanding of green plants starts by exploring with the senses, for example, feeling, smelling and looking at a variety of plants . Developing a knowledge and understanding of green plants across the key stages can help pupils to: explore the smell, texture and visual appearance of herbs, flowering plants and other plants recognise that plants grow from seeds and that they need light, water and warmth to flourish recognise the parts of a plant, for example, leaf, stem, flower, root, leading to an understanding of their role and function observe the life cycle of plants and recognise when they are living or dead ,for example, taking and viewing photographs at different times to show differences . Variationandclassification Knowledge and understanding of variation and classification begins by pupils' awareness that others are different from them. Learning about thevariation and classification of green plants across the key stages can help pupils to: recognise similarities and differences between themselves and others recognise that the variety of l iving things can be grouped in different ways. Living things intheirenvironment Knowledge and understanding of living things in their environment starts by exploring the local environment, for example, the school and its grounds. Developing knowledge and understanding of living things in their environment across the key stages can help pupils to: care for the environment recognise that different living things are suited to different environments, for example, f ish s wim in water, birds fly, plants grow in the earth23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 8RESPONDING TO PUPILS' NEEDS WHEN TEACHING SCIENCE 9 explore how the environment provides for living things, for example, food, shelter/protection. Materials and their properties Groupingandclassifyingmaterials Knowledge and understanding of grouping and classifying materials starts by exploring a range of materials with different sensory properties. Grouping and classifying materials across the key stages can help pupilsto: use all their available senses to explore and make responses to materials match a nd sort materials and recognise similarities and differences between them discover the properties of different materials, for example, roughness, ability to float explore the usefulness of materials with regard to properties, for example, thermal insulators, electrical conductors . Changingmaterials Knowledge and understanding of changing materials starts by noticing a change, for example, in shape, colour, temperature . Learning about changing materials across the key stages can help pupils to: explore materials that change shape by physical means investigate reversible changes, for example, freezing water, heating chocolate, dissolving sugar in water, drying clay investigate non-reversible changes, for example, heating butter and eggs, adding water to plaster, baking clay recognise how reactions can be useful, for example, baking powder in cooking, and not useful, for example, the rusting of iron. Physical processes Electricity Knowledge and understanding of electricity starts by using electricalequipment and items, for example, through a range of switches. Learning about electricity across the key stages can help pupils to: explore/use switches that operate electrical items with easily observable outcomes, for example, on/off, bright/dim light, and realise that their action causes the effect23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 910SCIENCE observe that electricity is used in a variety of ways in school and home, for example, light, power, heating use electrical appliances and everyday equipment safely in functional contexts, for example, PlayStation, audio or video recorder build simple series circuits using batteries, wires, bulbs, switches and other components, and test whether a circuit will work by using practical experiments. Forcesandmotion Knowledge and understanding of forces and motion starts by experien cing a range of movements followed by feeling and anticipating their effects, for example, being pushed on a swing or pulled on a ground sheet. Learning about forces and motion across the key stages can help pupils to: make movement happen by applying a force, for example, to doors, objects on wheels recognise that when things speed up, slow down or change direction or shape, there is a cause, for example, push or pull explore resistance to movement, for e xampl e, air resistance and parac hutes, friction and different shoe surfaces, water resistance and swimming investigate the properties of magnets explore the force of gravity, for example, things fall, gravity pulls things down. Lightandsound Knowledge and understanding of light and sound starts by exploring, recognising and responding to contrasting stimuli, for example, light and darkness, sound and silence . Learning about light and sound across the key stages can help pupils to: experience light respond to, locate and track (safe) sources of light explore shadows, reflections, coloured filters and lights experience sound recognise and locate sources of sound, including some that are far away make sounds using objects and materials, including their own bodies explore volume and pitch.23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 10TheEarthandbeyond Knowledge and understanding of the Earth and beyond starts by appreciating that night and day are different and are associated with different activities. Learning about the Earth and beyond across the key stages can help pupils to: be aware of the Sun during the day and know that there is no Sun light at night observe how the position of the Sun appears to change in the sky and how shadows change as this happens realise that the Earth is only one of several pl anets in the solar system. Improving access to the science curriculum Staff can make science more accessible by focusing on the senses. They can improve access by: using materials and resources that pupils can experience and understand through sight, sound, taste or smell giving pupils first-hand and direct scientific experiences through investigations, experiments, play and visits presenting materials and resources that pupils can understand through sight, touch, sound, taste or smell allowing pupils to observe and gain a scientific understanding where, because of visual or multi-sensory impairment or mobility difficulties, pupils cannot experience incidental learning of the wider world and theenvironment. Staff can also improve access by: using ICT, visual and other materials to increase pupils' knowledge of their personal surroundings and the wider world using scientific contexts (domestic and environmental) that are of inter est, and are relevant and meaningful, to pupils using specialist aids and equipment encouraging support from adults or other pupils, while giving pupils space and freedom to do things for themselves, allowing them sufficient time to respond adapting tasks or environments and using alternative activities where necessary, for example, where pupils have allergies to plants or animalsRESPONDING TO PUPILS' NEEDS WHEN TEACHING SCIENCE 1123046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 11 being aware of the pace at which pupils work and of the physical effort required balancing consistency and challenge, according to individual needs. Science can help pupils develop their broader communication and literacy skills through encouraging interaction with other pupils as well as staff. With some pupils, communication and literacy skills develop as they use a range of visual, written and tactile materials, for example, large print, symbols and symbol text . These skills also develop as pupils use ICT and other technological aids. Other pupils' skills develop as they use alternative and augmentative communication, for example, body movements, eye gaze, facial expressions and gestures, including pointing and signing.12SCIENCE23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 12OPPORTUNITIES AND ACTIVITIES AT KEY STAGE 1 13 Opportunities and activities at key stage 1 All aspects of the science programme of study at key stage 1 are appropriate for pupils with learning difficulties. With modification, it can provide stimulating and challenging learning opportunities. The focus of teaching science at key stage 1 may be on giving pupils opportunities to: explore and investigate, through a range of sensory activities which give feedback and generate interest engage in practical activities and investigations that extend their awar eness and understanding of themselves, for example, body awareness and self-awareness . Given these opportunities in science at key stage 1: allpupils with learning difficulties (including those with the most profound disabilities)build on their own experiences and on the exploration and investigation opportunitiesgiven in the early years foundation stage. They take part in scientific enquiry by exploring people, materials and other living things and respond to sensory experiences. mostpupils with learning difficulties (including those with severe difficulties in learn ing) who will develop further skills, knowledge and understanding in most aspects of the subjectbecome familiar with some scientific language. They are aware that their actions haveconsequences, for example, personal cause and effect, and that they can change materials. They collect evidence as part of scientific enquiry. a fewpupils with learning difficulties who will develop further aspects of knowledge, skills and understanding in the subjectrecor d and communicate their ideas and data, for example, using drawings, objects, symbols, and begin to evaluate evidence. They may answer scientific questions and use scientific language.23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 1314SCIENCE 14 Throughout key stage 1, staff can maintain and reinforce the knowledge, skills and understanding introduced during the foundation stage byapplying these in different areas, and introduce new learning. Thefollowing activities show how this can be done and provide examples of approaches staff can take with units of work in science. Sorting and using materials Pupilsexplore andinvestigatearange ofmaterialsThey may: use their senses to explore a range of materials and objects with strong tactile, visual, aural and/or olfactory qualities explore materials which are grouped by a given property, for example, all sweet items to taste, all wet items to feel, or have been selected for contrasting attributes , for example, sweet and sour, wet and dry indicate their preference for particular objects , materials or pr operties make a display about their favourite materials and objects with photographs of favourites sort materials according to particular properties, for example, hard and soft, or type of material , for example, wood or metal communicate about objects, for example, shiny, bendy use a feely bag to explore objects by touch and sound and try to identify the objects with staff asking appropriate questions, for example, 'Is it hard?' 'Is it furry?' 'Does it rattle?' take part in a material hunt in the classroom, school or school grounds to find objects made of the same materials, for example, wood, metal, plastic, clay. Pupils present and organise the objects (or photographs of them) on a labelled display explore different ways of grouping the same materials, for example, by colour, by size, by texture use secondary sources, for example, videos, to find out more about a particular material , for example, paper or stone23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 14OPPORTUNITIES AND ACTIVITIES AT KEY STAGE 1 15 explore properties for particular purposes and choose suitable materials, for example, make a hat for a doll to wear in the rain and try out different materials before choosing which material is waterproof. They may suggest ways of trying out the materials, justify their decision and communicate what they did and what they found. Plants Pupilsexploreandinvestigatearange ofplants They may: explore the smell, texture and visual appearance of a variety of plants and indicate preferences, for example, colours or scents identify similarities and differences between them, for example, they all have leaves, they are all green, they have different colour flowers and different shaped leaves identify some of the different parts of plants, for example, flower, leaf, roots explore the school gro unds and find different plants in different places (without picking them or pulling them up). They take photographs of the plants and later match them to the places where they were found, for example, the water lily in the pond, the tub of flowers in the front of the school, the tree in the car park visit a local garden centre. PupilsgrowplantsThey may: plant quick-growing seeds, help to look after them, observe them as they grow and take photographs at different intervals, t hen sequence them, for example, seed, seedling, young plant, flowering plant make a tactile book about their plant23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 1516SCIENCE 16 investigate a plant's need for water. They suggest the things plants need for survival, choosing from a selection of objects, for example, coat, watering can, breakfast cereal. They devise an investigation to test this, for example, to water some plants and not others, and observe what happens and make conclusions, for example, by matching the symbol for water to the healthy plant and the 'no water' symbol to the plant that died. Pupilstasteandgroupplants They may: explore the smell, texture and taste of plants (or parts of plants) tha t can be eaten by humans, for example, tomato, sweetcorn, lettuce, and compare them with ones that cannot be eaten by humans, for example, grass, tree bark, flowers , and sort and group them appropriately. Light and dark Pupilsexplore contrastsoflightanddarkness They may: experience contrasts of light and dark, noticing and anticipating changes experience darkness in a darkened or multi-sensory room and observe as the light is gradually increased search for objects and people in the dark cover and uncover their eyes, try on sunglasses and note the difference look at themselves and others in mirrors in settings which are light or gloomy. Pupilsexploreandinvesti gatelightsources They may: focus on and track light sources in a darkened room23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 16OPPORTUNITIES AND ACTIVITIES AT KEY STAGE 1 17 use switches to operate a range of lighting effects in a multi- sensory environment or on a computer, indicating preferences for particular effects look for different sources of light in the classroom/school, for example, central light, computer light, warning light on switches explore a range of types of light, for example, table lamps, fairy lights, torches, bicycle lights, light wands, candle light, observing the lighting effect and then repeat the activity in a dark room and in a light room. PupilsexploreandinvestigatelightwithothermaterialsThey may: explore a 'black box' (box with a small peephole in one end and a larger hole covered with cardboard in the top). They look for an object inside when the hole is covered (and there is no light) andwhen there is light. They shine torches of different brightness intothe box and decide which torch made the object easiest to see. They answer questions, for example, 'Can you see the objec t now?' 'What can we do so that you can see it?' shine light sources on different materials and objects to observe the effects and decide which are shiny, and sort materialsaccording to this property explore materials to find out if light shines through them listen to stories or poems about light and dark and night and day go outside on a day when there is some sunshine and some clouds and, without looking at the Sun, decide when the Sun is out and when it goes behind a cloud.23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 1718SCIENCE 18 Sound Pupilslistentosounds They may: experience contrasts of silence and sound locate sources of sound by turning, looking, touching listen to (and make) sounds on a resonance board keep very quiet and listen for sounds in the classroom, for example, voices in the next room, cars outside, an aeroplane, a telephone. They repeat this in different parts of the school and school grounds and go on a 'listening' walk listen to a recording of familiar voices, for example, ch ildre n in the class, known staff, family members listen to recordings of familiar sounds and identify what they are by pointing to a picture, photograph or symbol; play sound lotto explore feely bags containing auditory objects listen to different types of music and express likes and dislikes listen to sounds made behind a screen and decide what made the sound by choosing between objects/instruments listen to sounds at different distances away and muffled, for exam ple, a t icking clock under a cushion. Pupils makesounds They may: make sounds using their own bodies, for example, vocalising, singing, clapping, stamping, tapping their cheeks, and working together with another person, for example, moving one hand to clap against the other person's hand or offering their arm to be tapped use switches to make sounds on a computer, or operate music on an audio recorder make different sounds, using equipment such as a sound beam23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 18OPPORTUNITIES AND ACTIVITIES AT KEY STAGE 1 19 explore the sounds made by a range of musical instruments and other objects using different methods, for example, banging, plucking, shaking, blowing, and indicate preferences and dislikes feel vibrations when instruments are played explore loudness use additional equipment to change sounds, for example, microphones, echo units make musical instruments, for example, a simple drum, or elastic bands stretched over a box, and play them make sound effects to acc ompany a p oem, story or song and devise a story with sound effects.23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 1920 SCIENCE 20 Opportunities and activities at key stage 2 Much of the science programme of study at key stage 2 is relevant to pupils with learning difficulties. With modification, it can providestimulating and challenging learning opportunities. The focus of teaching science at key stage 2 may be on giving pupils opportunities to: recognise that they are growing and changing, and to learn about how the body changes in preparation for puberty control aspects of their immediate surroundings, for example, using forces and electrical circuits or changing materials for a purpose. Given these opportunities in science at key stage 2: allpupils with learning difficulties (including those with the most profound disabilities)continue to develop their experience and understanding of the world by using theirsenses, observing and exploring. Withappropriate support, they take part ininvestigations about living things, materialsand phenomena. They gain greater awarenessof life processes and of themselves as growingand changing individuals. most pupils with learning difficulties (including those with severe difficulties in learning) who will develop further skills, knowledge and understanding in most aspects of the subjectlearn about a wider range of living things,materials and phenomena. They carry outinvestigations with others and collect evidence,become familiar with some reference sources,record their results, for example, using objects,symbols or computer software, andcommunicate what they have done and whathappened. They use some scientific languageand answer scientific questions.23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 10/3/09 16:52 Page 20Some parts of the key stage 2 programme of study, such as those which need more abstract understanding, may be too demanding for some pupils. Such parts may become less demanding as pupils get older, but itmay not be appropriate to teach these parts to some pupils during this key stage. It may be more appropriate to teach the more demanding parts of the programme of study for key stage 1. Throughout key stage 2, staffcan maintain and reinforce the knowledge, skills and understan ding intr oduced during key stage 1 by applying these in different areas, and introduce new learning. The following activities show how this can bedone and provide examples of approaches staff can take with units ofwork in science.OPPORTUNITIES AND ACTIVITIES AT KEY STAGE 2 21 a fewpupils with learning difficulties who will develop further aspects of knowledge, skills and understanding in the subjectattempt to answer questions through testing and investigating. They ask scientific questions, use some reference sources, drawings, charts and diagrams to communicate their findingsand ideas. They recognise relevant evidence and evaluate it, draw conclusions from their data, consider if tests are fair or unfair, and link their scientific knowledge t o their everyday experiences.

With modification, it can provide stimulating and challenging learning opportunities. The focus of teaching science at key stage 3 may be on giving pupils opportunities to: extend their explorations and investigations from the familiar to a wider world recognise how science applies to their everyday lives, for example, appreciating what makes a healthy lifestyle . Given these opportunities in science at key stage 3: allpupils with learning difficulties (including those with the most profound disabilities)extend their scientific experience and understanding through explorations, experiments and investigations appropriate for their age. They work with others to collect evidence. mostpupils with learning difficulties (including those with severe difficulties in learning) who will develop further skills, knowledge and understanding i n most aspects of the subjectknow they need to ask questions about how things work and can make suggestions about how to find answers and to solve problems. They use a range of observations andmeasurements and different modes of datacollection. Pupils link their knowledge to their everyday lives, including their personal health and lifestyles. They use some reference sources; communicate what they have done;describe what has happened; draw conclusion s fr om their data; and recognise when a test is largely fair or unfair. a fewpupils with learning difficulties who will develop further aspects of knowledge, skills and understanding in the subjectmake comparisons and recognise significant differences when interpreting the results of tests and investigations. They communicatetheir ideas and findings. They understand some ways in which scientists work; evaluate their work; select; and use reference sourcesand beg in to apply their knowledge and understand ing of scientific ideas to familiar phenomena and everyday things.23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 28OPPORTUNITIES AND ACTIVITIES AT KEY STAGE 3 29 Some parts of the key stage 3 programme of study, for example, those involving abstract understanding, precise measurement or detailed depth of study, may be too demanding for some pupils. Such parts may become less demanding as pupils get older, but it may not be appropriate to teach these parts to some pupils during this key stage. It may be more appropriate to teach the more demanding parts of the programme of study for the earlier key stages. Throughout key stage 3, staff ca n maintain and reinforce the knowledge, skills and understanding introduced during the earlier key stages by applying these in different areas, and introduce new learning. The following activities show how this can be done and provide examples of approaches staff can take with units of work inscience. Habitats Pupilsexploredifferenthabitatsandorganismsconnectedtothose habitatsThey may: group pictures and photographs into plants, for example, trees and flowers, and animals, for example, insects, mammals, including humans explore habitats in the school grounds and the immediate locality, for example, hedge, tree, flower bed, under stones, and look for, and observe, plants and animals investigate a different habitat and record what the habitat is like, for e xample, wet/dry, shady/sunny, and what they find there, and collect evidence, for example, take photographs and carefully collect animals and leaf mould as evidence. They present their findings to other pupils and compare the findings from different habitats and discuss why different animals are found there group similar organisms together, for example, pupils are each given a picture and have to find their similar partner - bee/wasp, daisy/dandelion. They identify s imilarities and differences between or ganisms, for example, the number of legs, wings, colours, and use hand lenses to look carefully at the detail23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 2930SCIENCE devise simple keys to distinguish between organisms, for example, devise questions which distinguish between their collection of pictures - 'Does it have leaves?' 'Does it have six legs?' 'Does it live in water?' and play quiz games based on these observations use reference materials to identify organisms and to find information about a particular plant or animal plan and carry out an investigation and pose questions, for example, 'Do earthworms live above or below g round?' 'What do snails prefer to eat?' They decide how to collect evidence, what equipment to use, carry out the investigation and make observations, then record and communicate their findings explore contrasting habitats, for example, the Arctic, desert, underwater, through stimulus material, for example, videos, DVDs, interactive field trips observe and identify different physical features of the habitats and the type of animals and plants that live there and why, and match dif ferent organisms to habitats and explain why they match.23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 30OPPORTUNITIES AND ACTIVITIES AT KEY STAGE 3 31 Physical changes Pupilsexploreandinvestigatesolidsandliquids They may: explore a collection of solids, for example, wood, iron, and liquids, for example, shampoo, cooking oil, water, syrup , and sort them into 'solids' and 'liquids' and observe the similarities and differences between the two groups. Such work may be supported by a range of questions, for example, 'Can you spill them?' 'What happens if you tilt the bottle?' 'Which ones are runny?' explore ice and w ater and suggest how to freeze water to make ice, that is, change a liquid to a solid explore other solids, and think about, and suggest ways of, changing them into liquids by making them runny, for example, candle wax, butter, chocolate, and experiment by putting them in a warm place and observing what happens. Ways of stopping them from melting are suggested, for example, putting chocolate in the fridge, or using melted butter to make biscuits use secondary sources, for ex ample, v ideos, CD-ROMs, to observe other materials which need to be heated before they melt, for example, metals.

They discuss how to make the test fair, for example, by using the same amount of plasticine, the same height of water , and predict what might happen. They find out which pieces of plasticine drop to the bottom more quickly, record their results, draw basic conclusions from theirinvestigations, evaluate the investigation and discuss if they could improve it.23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 34OPPORTUNITIES AND ACTIVITIES AT KEY STAGE 4 35 Opportunities and activities at key stage 4 Much of the science programme of study at key stage 4 is relevant to pupils with learning difficulties.

The focus of teaching science at key stage 4 may be on giving pupils opportunities to: apply their previous knowledge, skills and experience in new situations consider explanations and the causation of things around them, their bodies a nd events. Given these opportunities in science at key stage 4: allpupils with learning difficulties (including those with the most profound disabilities)use experience, knowledge, skills and understanding attained at earlier key stages to help them engage in new activities andinvestigations. Staff may need to support them in the use of a wide range of equipment and materials. mostpupils with learning difficulties (including those with severe difficulties in learning) who w ill develop further skills, knowledge and understanding in most aspects of the subjectmake links between scientific experience and their everyday lives. They use different ways of presenting their data, for example, charts,diagrams and drawings. They recognise somerelevant evidence, make simple evaluations of their work, and ask some scientific questions. a fewpupils with learning difficulties who will develop further aspects of knowledge, skills and understa nding in the subjec tunderstand some positive and negative effects of scientific and technological developments.They select and use appropriate reference sources.

They display their results on a graph, using ICT predict what will happen when they repeat these measurements with a cold drink containing ice cubes. They record their results and communicate them carry out an investigation about keeping things cold, for example, wrapping ice cubes in different materials such as cling film, newspaper, cotton wool, tin foil, bubble wrap , and observe them at intervals. They predict what will happen, take photographs, and makedrawings to record their evidence and communicate what happ ened. They draw basic conclusions about insulators and relate this to everyday life, for example, taking frozen food home from the shops repeat this investigation for keeping things warm by using warm water in several containers, wrapping them in different materials, and discuss how to make a fair test, for example, identical containers, water same temperature at the start . They take the temperature at regula r intervals and record their results using ICT to display them on a graph.

The performance descriptions can be used by teachers in the same way as the national curriculum level descriptions to: decide which description best fits a pupil's performance over a period of time and in different contexts develop or support more focused day-to-day approaches to ongoing teacher assessment by using the descri ptions to refine and develop long-, medium- and short-term planning track linear progress towards attainment at national curriculum level 1 identify lateral progress by looking for related skills at similar levels across subjects record pupils' overall development and achievement, for example, at the end of a year or a key stage. The performance descriptions for P1 to P3 are common across all subjects. They outline the types and range of general performance that som e pupils with learning difficulties might characteristically demonstrate. Subject- focused examples are included to illustrate some of the ways in which staff might identify attainment in different subject contexts.Levels P4 to P8 describe pupils' performance in a way that indicates the emergence of skills, knowledge and understanding in each subject. The descriptions are characteristic of the types of attainment the learners are likely to demonstrate. P1 (i)Pupils encounter activities and experiences. They may be passive or r esistant. They may show simple reflex responses, for example, startling at sudden noises or movements . Any participation is fully prompted. P1 (ii)Pupils show emerging awareness of activities and experiences. They may have periods when they appear alert and ready to focus their attention on certain people, events, objects or parts of objects, for example, looking towards flashes of light or turning tow ards loud sounds. They may give intermittent reactions, for example, sometimes withdrawing their hands from changes in temperature. P2 (i)Pupils begin to respond consistently to familiar people, events and objects. They react to new activities and experiences, for example, discarding objects with unfamiliar textures . They begin to show interest in23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 4142SCIENCE people, events and objects, for example, leaning forward to follow the scent of a crushed herb . They accept and engage in coactive exploration, for example, feeling materials in hand-over-hand partnerships with a member of staff. P2 (ii)Pupils begin to be proactive in their interactions. They communicate consistent preferences and affective responses, for example, showing a consistent dislike for certain flavours or textures . They recognise familiar people, even ts and objects, for example, moving towards particular features of familiar environments . They perform actions, often by trial and improvement, and they remember learned responses over short periods of time, for example, rejecting food items after recent experience of bitter flavours. They cooperate with shared exploration and supported participation, for example, examining materials handed to them . P3 (i)Pupils begin to communicate intentionally. They seek at tention thr ough eye contact, gesture or action. They request events or activities, for example, reaching out towards a sound making object. They participate in shared activities with less support. They sustain concentration for short periods. They explore materials in increasingly complex ways, for example, pressing hard objects into soft textures. They observe the results of their own actions with interest, for example, scrunching up paper and examining the produ ct. They remember learned r esponses over more extended periods, for example, reaching out to touch a live animal with caution and sensitivity . P3 (ii)Pupils use emerging conventional communication. They greet known people and may initiate interactions and activities, for example, switching on a favourite piece of equipment in the light and sound room.They can remember learned responses over increasing periods of timeand may anticipate known events, for example, ba lls falling and bouncing on the floor. They may respond to options and choices with actions or gestures, for example, touching one substance rather than another . They actively explore objects and events for more extended periods, for example, feeling the textures of different parts of a plant . They apply potential solutions systematically to problems, for example, tipping a container in order to pour out its contents . P4Pupils explore objects and materials provided, c hanging some materials by physical means and observing the outcomes, for example, when mixing flour and water . Pupils communicate their awareness of changes in light, sound or movement. They imitate actions involving main body parts, for example, clapping or stamping. They make sounds using23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 42PERFORMANCE DESCRIPTIONS 43 their own bodies, for example, tapping, singing or vocalising , and imitate or copy sounds. They cause movement by a pushing or pulling action. 'Explore' includes access through any sensory mode. Teachers should ensure they are assessing intended, not accidental, actions. P5Pupils take part in activities focused on the anticipation of and enquiry into specific environments, for example, finding a hamster under straw, or a CD or video in a pile. They match objects and mat erials in terms of single features or properties, for example, temperature or colour. They indicate the before and after of material changes. They try out a range of equipment in familiar and relevant situations, for example, initiating the activation of a range of light sources. They respond to simple scientific questions, for example, 'Show me 'responding', etc, be done by any means appropriate to the pupil's preferred mode of communication and physical abilities. For some pupils this may mean directing an adult undertaking the task. P6Pupils recognise distinctive features of objects, for example, the features of living things in their environment, and know where they belong, for example, feathers on a bird, leaves on a tree. They begin to make generalisations, connections and predictions from regular experience, for example, expecting that ice cream will m elt, or making wheeled objects move faster by pushing on a smooth surface or releasing them down a slope. Pupils sort materials according to a single criterion when the contrast is obvious. They closely observe the changes that occur, for example, when materials are heated, cooled or mixed. Pupils identify some appliances that use electricity. They show they know some sources of sound and light, for example, remembering their location. P7Pupils understand the scie ntific use of some simple vocabulary, such as befor e, after, bumpy, grow, eat, move and can communicate related ideas and observations using simple phrases, for example, which food to give which animal. Pupils can demonstrate simple properties of light, sound and movement, for example, bright, noisy/quiet, fast/slow. They make simple records of their findings, for example, by putting pictures of an activity in sequence. They begin to make suggestions for planning and evaluatin g their work, for example, responding to the question 'Was that right or wrong?' 'Showing', 'demonstrating', 'trying out', 'responding', etc, may be done by any means appropriate to the pupil's preferred mode of communication and physical abilities. For some pupils this may mean directing an adult undertaking the task.23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science 9/3/09 12:20 Page 4344SCIENCE P8Pupils show they have observed patterns or regular changes in features of objects, living things and events, for example, chrysalis/butterfly day/night. They make some contribution to planning and evaluation and to recording their findings. They identify a range of common materials and know about some of their properties. They sort materials using simple criteria and communicate their observations of materials in terms of these properties. Pupils make their own o bservation s of changes of light, sound or movement that result from actions, for example, using a volume control or a dimmer switch and can describe the changes when questioned directly.23046 Science.qxp:23046 Science QCA/09/4036About this publication Who's it for?
