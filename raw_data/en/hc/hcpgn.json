The European Commission authorises COVID-19 vaccines, after evaluation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and consultation with the EU Member States. The first vaccines were given at the end of 2020. How COVID-19 vaccines work COVID-19 vaccines prevent COVID-19 by triggering an immune response. Most COVID-19 vaccines trigger these immune responses to a tiny fragment of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. If a person who has received a COVID-19 vaccine is infected by the virus later on, the immune system recognises the virus. Because it is already prepared to attack the virus, that person's immune system is able to protect them from COVID-19 disease. See more information on [How vaccines work](https://vaccination-info.eu/en/vaccine-facts/how-vaccines-work). Development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines COVID-19 vaccines are developed following the same legal requirements for quality, safety and efficacy as for all other vaccines. Like all vaccines, the effects of COVID-19 vaccines are tested first in the laboratory, including in animals, and then in human volunteers. The [European Medicines Agency](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/) (EMA) evaluates COVID-19 vaccines against the same high standards as for all other vaccines before they can be released for use. Read more on [the ] [Approval of vaccines in the European Union](http://www.vaccination-info.eu/en/vaccine-facts/approval-vaccines-european-union). What is different for COVID-19 vaccines is that development and approval are happening much faster, in response to the public-health emergency caused by the virus. EMA evaluates high-quality applications from companies developing COVID-19 vaccines in the shortest time possible, while ensuring its decisions remain robust. It does this by: - providing guidance to help developers of COVID-19 vaccines prepare to apply for approval; - using rapid review procedures; - assessing key data on COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they become available. Monitoring COVID-19 vaccine safety The EU continually monitors the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. EMA monitors side effects to these vaccines, as it does for all vaccines. In parallel, the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/) (ECDC) intensively monitors the [effectiveness](https://vaccination-info.eu/en/vaccine-facts/vaccine-effectiveness) of COVID-19 vaccines. This enables the EU to identify and evaluate new information that arises on the benefits and safety of COVID-19 vaccines promptly. This will make sure that any possible risks are detected and managed as quickly as possible: see [Monitoring vaccine safety and reporting side effects](https://vaccination-info.eu/en/vaccine-facts/monitoring-vaccine-safety-and-reporting-side-effects). Vaccines authorised for use in the European Union [](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/bimervax) Bimervax Bimervax contains a protein produced in the laboratory that consists of part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from the Alpha and Beta virus variants. [](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty) Comirnaty (BioNTech/Pfizer) Comirnaty contains a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) with instructions for producing a protein from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Comirnaty is also available as two adapted vaccines. [](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/covid-19-vaccine-janssen) Jcovden (Janssen-Cilag) Jcovden is made up of another virus (of the adenovirus family) that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein found on SARS-CoV-2. [](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/nuvaxovid) Nuvaxovid (Novavax) Nuvaxovid contains a version of a protein found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 (the spike protein), which has been produced in the laboratory. [](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/covid-19-vaccine-moderna) Spikevax (Moderna) Spikevax contains a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) with instructions for producing a protein from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Spikevax does not contain the virus itself and cannot cause COVID-19. Spikevax is also available as two adapted vaccines. [](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/covid-19-vaccine-inactivated-adjuvanted-valneva) Valneva (Valneva) Valneva contains whole particles of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) that has been inactivated (killed) and cannot cause the disease. [](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/summaries-opinion/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca) Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) COVID-19 Vaccine Vaxzevria is made up of another virus (of the adenovirus family) that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2. [](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vidprevtyn-beta) VidPrevtyn Beta (Sanofi Pasteur) VidPrevtyn Beta contains a version of a protein found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 (the spike protein of the virus that causes COVID-19), which has been produced in the laboratory. [ ](https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-tracker.html#uptake-tab) Vaccine tracker The COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker provides an overview of the progress in the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in adults (aged 18 years and above) across EU/EEA Member States. As an interactive dashboard, the Vaccine Tracker presents data on the number of vaccine doses distributed by manufacturers to each Member State for the different vaccines authorised for use in the EU and the number of first, second or unspecified doses administered to adult individuals.Read more Related content [](/en/disease-factsheets/covid-19) COVID-19 Key facts on COVID-19, symptoms, complications, long-term COVID-19, how it spreads, and risk factors.
