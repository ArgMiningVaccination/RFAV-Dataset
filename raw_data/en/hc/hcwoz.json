Integrative care programs Holistic nursing Our Holistic Nursing Services are available to cancer patients as part of the Cancer Center and/or inpatient treatments. We offer evidence-based, holistic modalities, such as energy healing, gentle massage, aromatherapy, meditation, guided imagery and relaxation techniques, that complement conventional medical care. Delivered by specially trained volunteers and practitioners, healing touch is a relaxing, nurturing energy therapy that helps patients and family members find balance with their physical, mental and spiritual comfort. Healing touch teaches therapeutic modalities that can help to manage symptoms such as pain, anxiety, insomnia and nausea, while reducing stress, promoting relaxation and healing. Our yoga class, offered multiple times weekly in our conference center, is designed to enhance and support physical mobility, strength and well-being. The careful sequencing of movement and breath awareness leads to a state of ease and empowerment. The practice of yoga will benefit all areas of the physical body, including the immune, cardiovascular, skeletal/muscular and nervous systems. Nutrition services are essential to promoting quality of life. Specialists provide safe and effective nutritional guidance from prevention, during treatment and continuing into survivorship. Monthly classes cover a variety of topics emphasizing diet and wellness, improving overall nutrition, and promoting healthy eating habits. Patient support We offer a monthly Cancer Care Orientation for newly diagnosed patients that provides an informative opportunity to understand the process of care, services and treatment. Professionally facilitated support groups are open to those who would like to share, discuss and address thoughts and concerns about the cancer experience. The Caregiver Support Program provides resources to those caring for loved ones facing acute or chronic illness. Family members can access a caregiver social worker or specially trained volunteers for support. We facilitate a bi-monthly Caregiver Support Group at the Hospital as well as monthly \"Caregiver Teas,\" where loved ones can share their experiences as well as find support for the caregiving journey. We also host a free program in partnership with the American Cancer Society designed for women dealing with physical changes associated with treatment. Monthly workshops teach patients techniques to help make the most of their appearance. Pain management is an approach that anticipates symptoms and reactions so that treatment is well managed for the best possible outcomes. This includes medical management, counseling and educational materials. Palliative care optimizes quality of life during treatment and end-of-life care. A multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, mental health professionals, social workers and spiritual counselors provide these services. White Plains Hospital offers support to patients even after they go home. Survivorship Care Plans provide a comprehensive treatment summary and follow-up plan of care to improve health and quality of life. In addition, a monthly series specific to breast cancer survivorship covers a range of topics related to traditional and holistic cancer care. "}
