The system is one of the strictest national vaccine policies in Europe, and has become a cultural and political flash point in France: over the last month, thousands of critics of President [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/01/can-emmanuel-macron-stem-the-populist-tide) have protested in the streets, decrying the passes as divisive and illiberal. The fight over the vaccine passes draws upon political tensions that predate the pandemic. Macron, a former member of the center-left Socialist Party, created his own centrist party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche!, and won [a runoff election](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/08/the-future-of-europe-hinges-on-a-face-off-in-france) politician [Marine Le Pen](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/le-pens-moment) in 2017. Macron's early economic policies, including tax breaks for the wealthy, quickly divided the country, with people across the political spectrum castigating him as a President concerned primarily with the interests of the \u00e9lite. I recently talked about Macron's pandemic policies\u2014and the broad populist resistance to his governance\u2014with C\u00e9cile Alduy, a professor of French literature and culture at Stanford University and an expert in French politics. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed France's \"nudge\" approach to vaccination policy, how the current wave of protests in France differs from the American anti-vaccine movement, and what the fight over health passes suggests about the future of French politics. How do you think Macron's vaccine policies have been playing out so far? Well, it's only recently that it's been stricter. Until mid-July, there was no restriction based on vaccination status, apart from large events. And, even back in the fall, Macron had vouched that he would never make vaccination an obligation for anyone. It's with the rise of the Delta variant, after fully opening up the country by June 30th, that the government decided to increasingly link certain rights and access to places to vaccination or testing. One nuance is that vaccination is compulsory only for health-care workers, starting September 15th, and a few other professionals who are directly in contact with populations. But otherwise, one can get what's called the pass sanitaire by three means. One is full vaccination. The second is a negative COVID test within the previous seventy-two hours. And the third is a proof of immunization from having contracted COVID. Why do you think Macron changed course and began some of the strictest vaccine policies in Europe? The change is part of a more general governmental attitude toward the pandemic, which is to use the nudge theory to sway the population in one direction. It's been the case for the confinement, or quarantining, as well: instead of making things compulsory, the government put in place measures that very strongly nudge the population to go in one direction. Here, it's vaccination. So, on the one hand, it's preserving the appearance of respecting individual rights and freedoms by not making it compulsory. On the other hand, it is nudging people strongly to get vaccinated, to make their lives easier, to access a number of services and cultural events, so that in the fall, we don't have to close the economy again. Around seventy per cent of the population is in agreement with imposing some kinds of restrictions on who can access certain services based on the risk they pose for others. But there is also a very strong and vocal and determined part of the population that strictly opposes any restriction in the name of the liberties, and also in the name of respecting individuals' reluctance to get vaccinated, because, according to them, there is not enough data on the side effects of the vaccine. Before we turn to the opposition, how well do you think the policy has been working in terms of nudging people to get vaccinated? It's been working really well, actually. Macron announced the expansion of his health-pass policy on Monday, July 12th. Appointments for vaccinations topped one million within a single day. There's been a significant uptick in appointments being made, whether it is for starting the vaccination process or finishing it, and it's being accompanied by a much more deliberate policy to make access to vaccination, even in places where people go on vacation, much easier, so that people can start the vaccination process where they reside, go on vacation, and finish it there. I think that we're talking about several million people getting into the process of completing their entire vaccination process over the summer, with the hope that at least eighty per cent will have received one dose by the end of August. So it could be called a success. There has certainly been, in France, some opposition to Macron's policy from the far right and the likes of Marine Le Pen. But there's also some resistance from the far left. How would you characterize the opposition? The specific thing about France is that the opposition to the health passes and the nudge approach to vaccination is coalescing the existing opposition to Macron, and follows social tensions that were embodied in the [Yellow Vest movement](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-complicated-politics-of-the-gilets-jaunes-movement), which existed before COVID. In terms of sociological makeup and ideological affinities, there's a pretty strong overlap between the Yellow Vest movement and the current anti-vaccination movement. The Yellow Vests emerged as a spontaneous social protest against a tax on gas that would affect predominantly lower-middle-class or lower-class people who rely on their cars to go to work pretty far away. Many rural communities felt that they were punished because they had no alternative to taking their cars. And it kind of erupted beyond the original pretext and became an opposition to what was labelled the \u00e9lite. So it was very strong, with a few hundred thousand people in the streets on some Saturdays. And it devolved into some violence against institutions in general, including the media, including assemblymen, including the police. The movement was extremely volatile. And, ideologically speaking, it was all over the map with one rallying cry, which was a very strong opposition to Macron as a person and a President. Today, we see some of the leaders of the movement back in the streets to oppose what they call anti-liberties and antisocial restrictions. There is this vaguely libertarian aspect to it, with libert\u00e9 as one of the slogans that has been used by many, whether they are on the far left or the far right. And what's very special and difficult to manage for the government is that, politically speaking, no party or movement really supports the Yellow Vests fully, but they are echoed by opposition leaders such as Marine Le Pen on the far right and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon on the far left, who condemn the fact that the restrictions are going to create a two-tiered society. They are capitalizing again on this idea that Macron is a divider of the country, that he is instituting a second-class citizenship, which was, again, very much a slogan of the Yellow Vests. So, the people in the streets today have a wide range of reasons to oppose the passes, and some are completely apolitical, like most of the Yellow Vests were. But the common denominator is this defiance to and distrust against institutions and the government. Is it the case that neither Marine Le Pen's party, the National Rally, or M\u00e9lenchon's party, La France Insoumise, has tried to expressly adopt this line of opposition as part of its platform? Or is it just about trying to ride the energy? It is rather the second. They are not proposing to get rid of the pass. They might nitpick on new aspects of the current law, especially the fact that there was this idea that you could be fired if you're a health-care worker and don't get vaccinated. But otherwise, they are more trying to channel and instrumentalize a spontaneous social movement for political gain without losing any legitimacy as potential Presidential candidates who would at some point have to deal with such difficult matters as handling a pandemic. It's very typical of Marine Le Pen, especially, to criticize the measures but also not propose anything different. She's not anti-vaccination, but, rather, expressing understanding for people who are demonstrating against the health pass. It's more a psychological play, trying to show empathy toward the protesters, and make their claims resonate with a wider segment of the population as part of an anti-Macron movement. Can you talk more about the left-wing opposition? In America, I've seen some people on the left suggest that we should have some concerns about creating a two-tiered society if marginalized populations are not able to get, or choose not to get, vaccinated for whatever reasons. But, broadly speaking, almost all of the opposition to vaccine mandates of any sort has come from the right. Right. The opposition that comes from the left has different reasons from the opposition that's coming from the far right. The opposition is based on workers' rights and a response to Macron's general social policies and the consequences of those policies for workers and disenfranchised people. But, for instance, in the demonstrations that were happening the last couple of Saturdays, you had unions marching to oppose the measures that would suspend contracts for workers who refused to get the health pass. Another aspect that's a little less underlined right now is the anti-democratic aspect, which is that the measures that are happening in the middle of the summer with very little discussion in parliament, and Macron has employed a top-down decision-making process throughout the pandemic. That makes the far left call Macron a monarch rather than a President. There are a lot of questions regarding the checks and balances of powers, with parliament being squeezed out of the decision-making process. So it's not in the name of libertarian values, but, rather, social and workers' rights. Do you think that the concerns about Macron's governing style have validity? What's complicated is that those concerns preceded the pandemic. And one can understandably conceive that, during an emergency crisis, such as COVID-19, suddenly happening in our lives, decisions have to be made extremely quickly. And the executive branch is legitimate in taking action quickly and swiftly. But the accusations that Macron has a top-down theory of governing precedes that, and it's part of the Yellow Vest movement's eruption as well.That's what complicates things in France: the personality and the governing style of Macron have added fuel to the fire of social protest, even throughout the pandemic, because of a lack of empathy and a kind of hazardous governing style. Macron has announced new measures out of the blue as a single individual leading the country rather than consulting with parties, mayors, or social organizations. So I think there is an element of validity in the criticism that decisions are being made authoritatively and announced in a style that's very theatrical, as if Jupiter has decided something and that's the law of the land, when the same measures could have been adopted through a process that would have involved more entities. That would have resulted maybe in more acceptance of those decisions because of wider consultation and deliberation. I think that some left-wing and right-wing parties might exaggerate this accusation in the current situation, because there's an emergency. But there is a basis of validity in saying that the governing style is kind of progressive-authoritarian in the sense that Parliament is squeezed out, mayors are squeezed out, unions and social organizations are squeezed out. And there's this very tiny council that makes all the decisions. My sense is that Macron's strategy over the past year or so has been to move to the center-right on a number of issues with the hope of getting some of Marine Le Pen's voters, and also everyone to his left, if he faces Le Pen in a runoff. Do you agree that this has been his strategy? And does it seem possible that the far left and far right could unite in an anti-Macron coalition? I agree with your analysis. There has been a shift from Macron toward the center-right, and sometimes just the plain right, especially on fiscal issues. And the idea is indeed to be able to rally the left, because he will be against Marine Le Pen, and also eat into the right-wing voters who might otherwise be attracted to Le Pen. But, in terms of the risks of this strategy, well, there are two. The biggest risk is abstention\u2014that people who voted for Macron to defeat Le Pen in 2017 have become so disillusioned and disappointed that they will not walk to the polls. There is this fear that turnout is going to diminish drastically. And, if turnout diminishes, it could tip the scales to help Le Pen, whose sympathizers continue to be mobilized. He's not giving an incentive to people who supported him, even if he was not their top choice five years ago. The second risk is that the anti-Macron sentiment will be so strong that people who are not very politicized, but want to express themselves, might see the election as a referendum against Macron and vote for whomever is against him. So you're correct that there's a risk that support for Macron, whether by default or positively, would be eroded by this continuing divisive governing style. Let me ask you one last question about Le Pen. You talked about her attempts to moderate her image. Has her party flirted with the COVID denialism that we see here in the U.S.? Or blaming the disease on immigrants, which we've also seen here? On COVID, Marine Le Pen is trying to seem like she is Presidential, and has legitimacy as a possible next President. She's really moderated her discourse and sent the word out to the representatives of her party to do the same. She's staying away from conspiracy theories. She has underlined since the beginning of the pandemic that it's not immigrants who brought in the virus\u2014it's the absence of frontiers and borders. So she amped up her anti-E.U. and pro-national-borders discourse at the beginning of the pandemic. But she's been very careful not to point fingers at people or categories of people. Do you have a sense of who has chosen not to get vaccinated in France? The three main factors that seem to be decisive are geography, age, and wealth. We have maps of the vaccination rates, and those maps overlap to some degree with the maps of income averages. The wealthier your neighborhood, the more likely you have been vaccinated. Politically speaking, certain regions and cities that lean center, center-left, and center-right are more vaccinated. When you look at the map, some regions that voted more for Le Pen are less vaccinated. And the third factor is age. The younger population is not getting as vaccinated as other groups. Have masks become a political issue in France the way they have here at all? No. There is virtually no anti-mask movement. It's just nothing comparable to here.
