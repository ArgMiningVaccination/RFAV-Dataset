She understands that seeking therapy is not an easy decision, and she maintains a personable and non-judgmental atmosphere while really digging in with her patients to give them the tools they need to improve their lives and overall emotional well-being. She typically uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), but is well-versed in other techniques including Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Emotionally Focused, Family/Marital, Family Systems, Gottman Method, Interpersonal, Mind-Fullness-Based (MBCT), Motivational Interviewing and Solutions Focused Brief (SFBT). With over 14 years in social work, Crystal has had the pleasure of providing services to children as young as four years old, the elderly, as well as individuals, couples, and families. She has experience providing intensive in-home and clinical out-patient family services to at-risk families; and she is able to build on the strengths of families in her care to resolve issues and preserve the family. Crystal sees patients for a variety of reasons which may include co-dependency issues, depression, anxiety, emotional problems, trauma, PTSD, bi-polar disorder, self-injuring behaviors, grief and loss, self-esteem issues, sexual abuse, life coaching, suicidal thoughts, gay, lesbian and transgender issues and important life transitions. While working with youth, Crystal has facilitated anger management groups and provided group psychotherapy to children and adolescents to address bullying and ways to properly employ conflict resolution. She can also provide therapy for ADHD behavior issues, divorce issues, social skills and a variety of other parental concerns. Crystal will provide diagnostic impressions based on clinical assessments and prepare an individualized treatment plan to initiate appropriate therapeutic services. Crystal works with individuals, couples and families who need assistance battling substance abuse, mental health, or are dually diagnosed and also provides on-site therapy for the elderly in nursing homes. She is especially supportive in dealing with chronic relapse issues and will work with a patient for as long as necessary to help them achieve their therapy goals. Crystal sees working in therapy as her calling. She has been compelled to help others from a young age since witnessing the struggles within her own family, of her friends, and in her community. She saw, first-hand, the difference in lives that professional therapists made and she wanted to make the same difference. Crystal studied Social Work and Spanish while at Wichita State University and continued her education at Newman University and obtained her Masters of Social Work. Crystal is a Kansas native who recently relocated to Georgia with her husband and two beautiful daughters. She is an avid runner and loves to exercise and cook. She loves the beach and is very happy to be living closer to the ocean than Kansas offered. A unique trait that Crystal possesses is that she has heterochromia, which means she has one green eye and one brown. "}
