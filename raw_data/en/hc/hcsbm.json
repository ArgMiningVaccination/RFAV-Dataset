OKAMOTO Deputy to the Chairperson BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT THURSDAY, MARCH 19,2009 3:45 P.M. ROOM 225 HOUSE BILL NO. 1663, HD1 RELATING TO TARO SECURITY Chairperson Gabbard and Members of the Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to testify on House Bill No. 1663, HD1. The purpose of this bill is to prohibit the development, testing, propagation, release, importation, planting, and growing of genetically modified Hawaiian taro in the State of Hawaii. In addition, this bill restricts the genetic modification of non-Hawaiian taro only to enclosed laboratories where access is denied to the general public and prohibits outdoor field testing or release of genetically modified taro within the State of Hawaii. The Department offers comments. Agriculture, from its beginning to present, has suffered from pest and disease infestation causing enormous, unpredictable losses in food production. Biotechnology is a critical tool used in many countries to combat crop threatening insects and diseases. Without the biotech development of the ringspot virus resistant papaya, all papaya production in Hawaii, both conventional and organic would have been devastated by the disease. The loss of taro or any major industry in agriculture, by any means, would be devastating to Hawaii. However, advancements in biotechnology exist only through continued research. HB1663, HD1 Page 2 While the department generally does not agree with banning the use of scientifically acceptable technology, we recognize that this House Draft 1 version attempts to reconcile the cultural issue and the need for research. The Department acknowledges and respects the testimony of the Kauai Taro Growers Association, that in deference to the Hawaiian culture, no genetically engineered research should be done on stated Hawaiian cultivars and that research on non-Hawaiian cultivars shall be limited to approved facilities only with no outdoor field testing or release of genetically engineered taro within the State of Hawaii. Agriculture is already at a critical state as battles rage over water, land and limited resources. Let us continue to support co-existence among all agriculture sectors.

Kalo (Taro) is an important food crop in Hawaii which is a complex carbohydrate whose hypo-allergenic properties are life-saving for those with digestive disorders and allergies and the health implications of non-taro genes in genetically engineered kalo have never been tested, nor have they been approved for human consumption. 2. Cold water and adjusting growing regimes will reduce the threat of damaging taro disease, and as raw taro and value-added taro products represent a multi-million dollar crop in Hawaii with great potential for further growth as the State moves towards food security and self\u00ad sufficiency, it is important to note that neither of these issues requires a genetically engineered taro solution. 3. Millers and consumers have specifically and consistently rejected the use of genetically modified taro or poi. For these reasons I humbly ask the committee on Energy and Environment to recommend passage of HB A. Mateo Vice-Chair Michael J. Molina Council Members Gladys C. Baisa Jo Anne Johnson Sol P.

HIGH STREET WAILUKU, MAUl, HA WAIl 96793 www.mauicounty.gov/council March 18, 2009 TO: Honorable Mike Gabbard, Chair Senate Committee on Energy and Environment FROM: Director of Council Services Ken Fukuoka SUBJECT: HEARING CH 19,2009; TESTIMONY TO PROVIDE COMMENTS ON HB 1663, HDl, RELATING TO TARO SECURITY Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important measure. The purpose of this measure is to prohibit the development, testing, propagation, release, importation, planting, or growing of genetically modified Hawaiian taro in the state. This measure also prohibits certain activities related to genetically modified non-Hawaiian taro. The Maui County Council has not had the opportunity to take a formal position on this measure. Therefore, I am providing this testimony in my capacity as an individual member of the Maui County Council. I offer the following comments on this measure: 1. Kala has tremendous agricultural, cultural, and traditional significance to the residents of Hawaii. Genetically modified taro is disrespectful of the cultural foundation that taro holds for Hawaii's people. Therefore, I support the intent of this measure to protect traditional types of Hawaiian taro. 2. The attached Maui County Resolution No. 08-31 is indicative of Maui County's support of State legislation to protect our native taro. 3. While I support the intent of this measure, I am disappointed that this measure does not designate enforcement authority to an agency that has the proper resources to regulate this type of activity. Thank you for your consideration of my testimony. ocs:proj:legis:09Iegis:09testimony: hb I 663,hd l.Jlaf09-082a_ln Resolution No. 08-31 URGING SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL NO. 958, RELATING TO GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS WHEREAS, Senate Bill No. 958, currently pending before the Hawaii State Legislature, will impose a ten-year moratorium on developing, testing, propagating, cultivating, growing, and raising genetically-engineered taro in the State; and WHEREAS, kalo, the Hawaiian word for taro, is a culturally significant plant to the kanaka maoli, Hawaii's indigenous peoples; and WHEREAS, kalo is an integral part of the Native Hawaiian culture and represents Haloa, the elder brother of man, and genetically altering the structure of the taro plant represents a defilement of the genealogical link between the two; and. WHEREAS, today, there remain approximately 85 varieties of kalo out of the hundreds that were known in Hawaii and, of these, the majority, approximately 69 varieties, are unique to the Hawaiian islands due to the horticultural skills of native Hawaiian farmers; and WHEREAS, farmers, Hawaiian groups, and private individuals have expressed their concerns that genetically-modified taro will destroy the genetic strains of native taro species, and is disrespectful of the cultural foundation taro holds for Native Hawaiians and their religious practices; and WHEREAS, kalo is a healthy and nutritious staple in the diets of many residents throughout the State of Hawaii; and WHEREAS, the important cultural relationship between kalo and the kanaka maoH expresses the spiritual and physical well-being of not only the kanaka maoli and their heritage, but also symbolizes the environmental, social, and cultural values important to the State of Hawaii; and WHEREAS, kalo continues to have tremendous aglicultural, cultural, and traditional significance to the residents of our County and State; and Resolution No. 08-31 --..:..----- WHEREAS, cross~pol1ination of genetically-modified kalo would place an immeasureable threat on traditional varieties; and WHEREAS, the amount of usable land for raising kalo is scarce in the County of Maui, and any negative impact would devastate the kalo industry in the County of Maui; and WHEREAS, experimenting with the genetic engineering of this crop, without thoroughly examining and evaluating the adverse effects of that process, is careless and could have far~reaching, irreversible, and unintended consequences; and WHEREAS, the purpose of Senate Bill No. 958 is to recognize the importance of kalo in the heritage of the State, by creating a ten-year moratorium on developing, testing, propagating, cultivating, growing, and raising of genetically-engineered kalo in the State of Hawaii; now, therefore, BE IT RESOL YED by the Council of the County of Maui: 1. That it hereby urges support of Senate Bill No. 958, which will protect the biological lifeblood of the State from irreparable harm; and 2. That certified copies of this resolution be transmitted to the Honorable Charmaine Tavares, Mayor, County ofMaui; the Honorable Linda Lingle, Governor, State of Hawaii; the State House of Representatives; the State Senate; Sandra Lee Kunimoto, Director, State Department of Agriculture; Andrew Hashimoto, Dean, College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CT AHR), University of Hawaii at Manoa; Harold Keyser, CT Maui Victor Pellegrino; and Ritte. COUNCIL OF THE COUNTY OF MAUl WAILUKU, HAWAII 96793 CERTIFICATION OF ADOPTION It is HEREBY CERTIFIED that RESOLUTION NO. 08-31 was adopted by the Council of the County of Maui, State of Hawaii, on the 4th day of April, 2008, by the following vote: G. Chair Vlce-Chw ROLLCALL Aye Aye Excused Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye @I--lA OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS Legislative Testimony HB 1663, HD 1, RELATING TO TARO SECURITY Senate Committee on Energy and Environment March 19, 2009 3:45 p.m. Room: 225 The Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) SUPPORTS, with amendments H.B. 1663, H.D. 1, which would prohibit any individual from developing, testing, propagating, releasing, importing, planting or growing genetically modified taro in Hawaiyi. We much preferred H.B. 1663, which did not incorporate amendments that would limit most of the protections afforded only to \"Hawaiian taro\", and only prohibit certain activities related to genetically modified \"non-Hawaiian\" taro. We are concerned that cross pollination is very difficult to prevent, and our main intention is to protect Haloa. Nonetheless, OHA supports the original intent of this measure as an important recognition of a plant that has genealogical, spiritual and cultural links with Native Hawaiians and Hawai'i. Furthermore, kalo is integral to the identity of Native Hawaiians and, thus, the State of Hawai'i as a whole. The traditional moyolelo of Wakea and Papahanaumoku explains that the first kalo plant, Haloanakalaukapalili, is the elder brother of Native Hawaiians. As the elder sibling, Haloa provides sustenance to Native Hawaiians, and in return, we, the younger sibling, care for him and ensure that he flourishes. The bond that connects Native Hawaiians to kalo remains a sacred one, and our kuleana dictates that we preserve that bond and protect Haloa. A living entity of this eminence cannot be modified or scientifically \"improved.\" He must be honored and left alone. OHA recognizes that Haloa is facing many challenges today, including diseases, invasive species and a dearth of water and farmable land. However, we believe that there are natural alternatives to genetic engineering -such as fallowing loyi, restoring stream flows and improving the overall health of the environment -that have yet to be fully explored. We suggest scientists work with kalo farmers and the Native Hawaiian community to conduct a complete and comprehensive examination of these natural methods, which are neither intrusive nor offensive to Haloa or our culture. OHA respectfully urges the committee to PASS H.B. 1663, H.D. 1, by amending it back to the original language in H.B. 1663. Mahalo for the opportunity to testify. UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI'I SYSTEM Legislative Testimony Testimony Presented Before the Senate Committee on Energy and Environment Thursday, March 19, 2009 at 3:45 p.m. by James R Gaines Vice President for Research, University of Hawai'i HB1663HD1 RELATING TO TARO SECURITY The University of Hawai'i (UH) is sensitive to and mindful of the spiritual and cultural significance of taro in Hawai'i and believes that the compromises offered in HB1663HD1 provide a foundation upon which constructive work on known threats to taro can be conducted. However, from previous testimony on this bill we understand that the most significant issues affecting taro in Hawai'i, invasive species and diseases associated with imported taro and issues related to agriculture such as access to land, reduced numbers of farmers, water quality and loi health, are not being addressed by this legislation. The UH must reiterate that research is not the problem nor is it a threat to Hawaiian taro. Research is not a cultural issue and we respectfully oppose the passage of this bill. Nonetheless, the University of Hawai'i (UH) accepts and will abide by the compromise language of HB1663HD1 that prohibits the genetic modification of any Hawaiian taro varieties and restricts genetic modification and testing of non-Hawaiian taro to enclosed laboratories where entry into such a laboratory is prohibited to the general public. The UH will continue to participate on the Taro Task Force in order to help farmers identify and implement solutions that will address the multitude of existing threats to taro in Hawaii. We believe it would be prudent for this Legislature to examine the outcomes of the Taro Task Force's efforts before supporting any further legislation regarding restrictions on taro research in our state. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this bill. Testimony Presented before the Committee on Energy and Environment. Sen. Mike Gabbard, Chair Sen. Kalani English, Vice Chair Date: Time: Place: Thursday, March 19 3:45 p.m. Rm225 State Capitol 415 South Beretania Street by Richard M. Manshardt, Professor Department of Tropical Plant & Soil Sciences College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources University ofHawai'i at Manoa RELATING TO HB1663 HDl, REGARDING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TARO. This bill prohibits the development, testing, propagation, release, importation, planting, and growing of genetically modified Hawaiian taro in the State of Hawaii. My name is Richard Manshardt. I am a professor and plant geneticist in CT AHR at VH Manoa. I have 25 years of research and teaching experience in crop sciences at VH, including work in conventional crop breeding and the development of genetically engineered virus-resistant papaya varieties for Hawaii growers. I am providing testimony on my own behalf, not officially presenting the position of CTAHR or VH on this bill. I respectfully oppose HB1663 HDI. Most of the text of this bill tells of the spiritual significance of taro in the Hawaiian culture. The drafters of the bill hold the taro plant in special regard, connecting it with the origin of Hawaiian culture, much as others in our multicultural society place the body and blood of Jesus Christ in the central role ofthe Christian community. We are guaranteed our freedom of belief by the first amendment to the VS Constitution, and this is good and right. But if one group's beliefs are used to justify restricting the actions of others, that may not be good or right. The stated objective ofHB1663 HDlis to impose a moratorium on research or production of genetically engineered Hawaiian taro, but there is no logical development of ideas to show why a moratorium is appropriate. The bill doesn't explain the connection between taro's spiritual importance and genetic engineering, so the reader is left to conclude that the drafters of the bill want the moratorium because genetically engineered taro violates their belief in a genealogical relationship to taro. The bill basically says, \"You can't use genetic engineering to improve taro, because we don't like that idea, and no other justification is needed.\" Because agriculture is dynamic, with crop varieties, weather conditions, and pests that influence production changing from year to year, researchers need all the tools they can get to protect and improve farm production. In my experience, genetic engineering is a useful, effective, and safe tool for crop improvement. Genetic engineering is not appropriate for all breeding objectives and is not going to replace conventional breeding methodologies based on cross-pollination, but a moratorium on its application to taro or any other crop is not going to serve the long term interests of growers or consumers in Hawaii. At a minimum, we need to be able to do genetic engineering research to properly evaluate the risklbenefit ratio of this approach in improving taro. Please remember that new variety development, whether by conventional means or genetic engineering, is a decade-long process and cannot be turned on and off arbitrarily. The legislature has a clear role here to support the concept that technical problems need to be addressed and resolved in a scientific context, where logical thinking based on experimental data is foremost, rather than religious, cultural, or political considerations. Thank you for this opportunity to testify, and I ask you to please vote against HB1663 HDI. Senate Hearing: HB 1663 2009 Regular Session Title: Genetically Modified Taro; Prohibition COMMITTEE ON ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT Sen. Mike Gabbard, Chair Sen. Ka1ani English, Vice Chair Position: Support with reservations Submitted By: Robert Paull, Honolulu, HI 96821 Testimony: I have been a Professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa for nearly thirty years in the area of crop production and plant sciences. I have been involved in plant sciences and plant breeding for forty years and published in journals on the use of this technology. This testimony is submitted as a private citizen and voter, and not as a representative of the University. In the last five years, the legislature has considered a number of Bills on genetic engineered crops. All these bills are designed to place restrictions on this technology and limit freedom of choice. The Bills are not science or risk-based but based upon the misuse and abuse of science, and belief that there must be a possible unknown risk. All the Bills heard by the Legislature refuse to compare risks amongst all plant breeding methods. There is a claim in this Bill that diseases can be controlled by using cold water and adjusting growing regime. If this is the case then why have not the diseases been controlled and therefore no longer a problem. This control method probably does not work for a new viral disease. Banning the use of genetic engineering limits the approaches available to solve present and potential future problems. In addition, this Bill in the definitions excludes non-directed mutagenesis. Non-directed mutagenesis is done with high levels of irradiation and very toxic chemicals. The exclusion is not justified on scientific grounds as the National Research Council has concluded that this technology has a greater potential for unwanted changes than genetic engineering. It is not obvious how this exclusion requirement help human health or the environment or in this Bill the \"cultural integrity ofkalo\". The definitions in this Bill are so overly broad with no definition of \"traditional methods of breeding, hybridization, or non-directed mutagenesis.\" Later in the Bill it talks about \"controlled hand-pollination\" suggesting this is the only method allowed. This means that all breeding methods including tissue culture developed in the last 1 00 years are banned to improve taro in Hawaii. It is unclear which 'Bun-Long' (Chinese) taro is referred to in this Bills. In China, the general term \"Bun-Long\" is used to refer to a number of very distinct varieties oftaro depending upon where it is being grown. Since different \"Bun-Long\" taro varieties have been brought to Hawaii in the last fifty years from South-East Asia, Taiwan and China are they covered by this ban. This amended House Bill is a compromise that will allow research to continue and all approaches to solving taro production problems to be evaluated. HAWAII FARM BUREAU FEDERATION 2343 ROSE STREET HONOLULU, HI 96819 Committee on Energy and Environment Hearing Date & Time: Wednesday, 3-19-09 3:45 pm HB 1663 HD1 Relating to Taro Security Chairman Gabbard and Members of the Committee, The Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation is the largest general agriculture organization in the State of Hawaii with over 1600 members Statewide supports. HFBF comes before you today in support of our commercial taro farmers across the State. HFBF and all of our farmers respect the cultural significance of taro. We do not question the desire to have a population of cultural significant varieties kept in its' \"pure\" form. Farm Bureau policy on sustainability declares the importance of flexibility in cropping practices for successful agriculture. Our policy also clearly opposes limitations on the production or use of genetically modified crops. While we recognize the cultural significance of the plant, we also believe there is a major commercial role for taro in Hawaii. Before you today are the growers who provide the majority if not all of the taro you and I eat. Commercial farmers and ranchers are in constant search of new technologies to advance the long term sustainability and viability of their operations. Genetic modification of crops is the latest technology that has advanced the development of new varieties providing farmers with a tool to outpace the increasing costs faced by the industry. Contrary to frequent statements, GM crops are among the most tested to be introduced into the fields. They are subjected to experiments and analysis far beyond that for conventional or mutational breeding processes. For us in Hawaii, the results are tangible. Without GM, the papaya industry would not exist and the pockets of organic papaya would not be possible due to the prevalence of the Ringspot virus. All of these technologies take time. When one recognizes the urgency to develop the technology because of a problem it will be too late. We urge the committee to consider all of the ramifications as decision on this measure is made. What is the decision between having a GM taro or having no taro? The preamble to this measure extols the value of taro. It truly is an incredible plant that everyone should be able to have access when and if they want it. It would truly be a shame if we are not doing all we can to make sure taro is available for everyone for many generations to come. It is also 1 important that the capacity to develop critical crop characteristics whether it be disease resistance or traits such as improved nutritional value be here in Hawaii. Despite statements to the contrary, techniques are available to protect the genetic integrity of culturally important varieties and we strongly support the implementation of those practices for cultural plantings in contrast to commercial plantings. Hawaii Farm Bureau is in support of our commercial taro farmers who provide the majority of taro in the marketplace. They grow the poi everyone eats. While we do not support any moratoriums, HFBF is willing to compromise by recognizing a moratorium on named Hawaiian varieties to protect the right to research other taro varieties to protect the right of acess of this important crop for future generations. Our farmers have invested significant amount of time on this measure and we feel it is in everyone's benefit to reach a conclusion. We believe the risk to this crop is great enough to take this position. At this same time, we are on record that we will not accept any other moratoriums on any other crops in the future. Thank you for this opportunity to provide comment on this measure. Respectfully submitted, Dean Okimoto, President Hawaii Farm Bureau 2 MAR-17-2009 14:46 HARe ~ HARe 8084865020 Hawaii Agriculture Road Kunia, Hawaii 96759 Ph: 808-621-l350/Fax: 808-621-l359 TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT HOUSE BILL 1663HDI RELATING TO TARO SECURITY March 19, 2009 Chair Gabbard and Members of the Committee: P.002 My name is Stephanie Whalen. I am the Executive Director of the Hawaii Agriculture Research Center (HARe). I am testifying today on behalf of the center and its research and support staff. HARe supports the intent of House Bill 1663 HDl, Relating to Taro Security which is an attempt to reach a compromise and further discussion over the highly emotive legislation regarding taro and the use of biotechnology. The research community has already agreed to limit research in this area with respect to Hawaiian taro and the process to commercialize an engineered plant requires grower commitment and involvement. Therefore even without this measure there is no likelihood of an engineered taro being commercialized. However, passage of this bill would provide further assurances to the Hawaiian community that this would not occur while not limiting those of a different philosophy the access to this technology. Thank you for this opportunity to provide comments for your consideration. Testimony for ENE 3/19/09 3:45PM HB1663HD1 Conference Room: 225 Testifier Submitted Haraguchi, President Organization: Kaua'i Taro Growers Association Kalani English and committee members: Mahalo for the opportunity to present our testimony to support this bill in its present form and request that it be unamended. We have been receiving calls from Hawai'i, Maui, Oahu and the mainland threatening to boycott our taro farm and two. other millers, unless we support the SB 709. Even though we feel it's an invasion of our privacy and hurts the taro industry and ultimately the taro farmers, we feel even more strongly, that the 42 taro farms representing 396 acres oppose a ban on research of non-Hawaiian varieties of taro, must be heard. The taro industry has been on a steady decline from 1948 when there was 14,000,000 pounds oftaro, to 6,800,000 in 2000 and now 4,300,000 pounds that correlates with the decline in taro farms. This decline is the result of many facets and just remedying a few problems is not the answer. Taro farmers look at all avenues which includes continuing research on the non Hawaiian varieties. Both organic and conventional taro farms suffer from a mild form of leaf blight that organic practices have not cured. And this leafblight exists on dry land taro where cold water is not the issue. So how will taro survive when the severe form of leaf blight like the ones in Samoa and the Soloman Islands arrives in Hawai'i? Farmers in Hanalei are already working with CT AHR and HARC to eradicate the apple snails with nontoxic natural extracts which proved successful. They are also experimenting with compost, green manure, cover crops and organic fertilizers to transition to sustainable methods. And research is another option that should be available to find remedies and sometimes unexpected remedies. Taro farming is affected by many facets and farmers need to be open to the options available. Kauai taro farmers provide 78% of the state supply of 4,300,000 pounds. Kauai farmers also have the highest yield per acre at 13,600 lb/acre and OahulMaui at 10,533 lb/acre and Big Island at 4,222 lb/acre. The following calculation is the amount of servings per week that the Kauai taro farmers supply the state. 4,300,000 X 78% = 3,354,000 lbs from Kauai 3,354,000 4 (servings per lb) = 13,416,000 servings 13,416,000 servings / 52 weeks = 258,000 servings per week 1 We support the Native Hawaiian culture and that there be no GMO research on the Hawaiian varieties. And that all research on non-Hawaiian varieties is done in a safe and permitted facility that is secured from the general public and that no open field test is conducted in Hawaii. According to DOA, new pests and diseases are entering uninspected since 2006, due to a change in federal procedures since 9111 that doesn't allow our state inspectors to check the 900,000+ pounds oftaro entering Hawaii per year. From 1997 to 2005 there were over 345 insects, mollusks, weeds and nematodes (and this does not include possible bacteria, fungus or diseases) that the state inspectors used to stop prior to 2006 and it would be a matter of time before a disease like the one in the Soloman Islands that decimated the taro crops. The insect vector required to transmit this disease is found in Hawaii. Dr Miyasaka's team inserted an oxalate oxidase gene from wheat in Chinese Bun Long taro that increased tolerance to the leaf blight. Based on this research, they can look for similar genes found naturally within the Hawaiian taro gene pool and improve disease resistance using conventional cross pollination with existing non-GMO varieties. This will also allow them to identify which taro variety has the specific gene their looking for, and then to cross breed with better accuracy, to avoid matching plants by trial and error, which takes many trials and a lot of time finding the right one in a process of elimination. This bill will remove the option of using genetic engineering as a tool to identify important disease resistance genes within the taro gene pool. GE is a very precise method of identifying and selecting the gene which may be resistant to leaf blight diseases. We want it to be very clear that there are no GMO taro plants in any fields, that there is no GMO taro to plant. The taro farmers are asking for help to preserve their livelihood and future, by not banning research on the other varieties that may someday provide an answer to a disease or problem that may occur. The 68 Hawaiian taro varieties remaining today will be vulnerable to the diseases that may arrive in Hawai'i. To start research at the time of occurrence will be too late and time will be wasted to undo the ban while the taro crops decline. There are some inferences that the commercial taro farmers are only after the money, control and profit, but that is not the case. With the price of poi reaching up to $8.99 - $10.00 (Whole Foods store) per pound of poi in Hawaii, the farmers are only receiving 6% of that at $.60 per pound. Many years back our farm had been approached by large firms that are willing to buy huge quantities of taro from us that would have left no taro for the poi market. Even though we could get a better price for our taro, we didn't want to leave our locals without poi. This issue has divided farmers, families and communities within Hawaii, and many don't see the bigger picture, that other countries see Hawaii's taro shortages as an opportunity and that there's a market to import taro. In Australia, there's a Taro Growers Association 2 comprised of 50 farmers and increasing. There are considerations for the government to assist in funding for mechanization to increase production for the farmers. They also hold conferences and are looking at research to deal with the Samoan leaf blight and other diseases that may affect their industry. There's also taro from China that is supplying McDonald's taro pie and they probably would prefer to have Hawaiian taro for better marketing and public relations. . In my perspective, every farmer, whether big or small, full time or part time, works hard and I respect them for continuing this way oflife. In doing so, this is the farmers' satisfaction, having the consumers enjoy our product. Statistics show the declining trend for taro farming in Hawaii and the taro farmers need help and are asking for help so that you will not say to us, \"Why didn't you tell us?\" And what will be the answer when the poi consumers ask, \"Where's our poi, So let's support our Hawaii taro farmers so that there will be Hawaiian taro and poi in the future and not taro from Australia, China, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico and the largest exporter of taro at this time -Africa. 3 Testimony for ENE 3/19/09 3:45PM HB1663HD1 Conference Testifier Submitted Haraguchi, President Organization: Kaua'i Taro Growers Association Kalani English and committee members: Mahalo for the opportunity to present our testimony to support this bill in its present form and request that it be unamended.

The following calculation is the amount of servings per week that the Kauai taro farmers supply the state. 4,300,000 X 78% = 3,354,000 lbs from Kauai 3,354,000 4 (servings per lb) = 13,416,000 servings 13,416,000 servings / 52 weeks = 258,000 servings per week 1 We support the Native Hawaiian culture and that there be no GMO research on the Hawaiian varieties. And that all research on non-Hawaiian varieties is done in a safe and permitted facility that is secured from the general public and that no open field test is conducted in Hawaii. According to DOA, new pests and diseases are entering uninspected since 2006, due to a change in federal procedures since 9111 that doesn't allow our state inspectors to check the 900,000+ pounds oftaro entering Hawaii per year. From 1997 to 2005 there were over 345 insects, mollusks, weeds and nematodes (and this does not include possible bacteria, fungus or diseases) that the state inspectors used to stop prior to 2006 and it would be a matter of time before a disease like the one in the Soloman Islands that decimated the taro crops. The insect vector required to transmit this disease is found in Hawaii. Dr Miyasaka's team inserted an oxalate oxidase gene from wheat in Chinese Bun Long taro that increased tolerance to the leaf blight. Based on this research, they can look for similar genes found naturally within the Hawaiian taro gene pool and improve disease resistance using conventional cross pollination with existing non-GMO varieties. This will also allow them to identify which taro variety has the specific gene their looking for, and then to cross breed with better accuracy, to avoid matching plants by trial and error, which takes many trials and a lot of time finding the right one in a process of elimination. This bill will remove the option of using genetic engineering as a tool to identify important disease resistance genes within the taro gene pool. GE is a very precise method of identifying and selecting the gene which may be resistant to leaf blight diseases. We want it to be very clear that there are no GMO taro plants in any fields, that there is no GMO taro to plant. The taro farmers are asking for help to preserve their livelihood and future, by not banning research on the other varieties that may someday provide an answer to a disease or problem that may occur. The 68 Hawaiian taro varieties remaining today will be vulnerable to the diseases that may arrive in Hawai'i. To start research at the time of occurrence will be too late and time will be wasted to undo the ban while the taro crops decline. There are some inferences that the commercial taro farmers are only after the money, control and profit, but that is not the case. With the price of poi reaching up to $8.99 - $10.00 (Whole Foods store) per pound of poi in Hawaii, the farmers are only receiving 6% of that at $.60 per pound. Many years back our farm had been approached by large firms that are willing to buy huge quantities of taro from us that would have left no taro for the poi market. Even though we could get a better price for our taro, we didn't want to leave our locals without poi. This issue has divided farmers, families and communities within Hawaii, and many don't see the bigger picture, that other countries see Hawaii's taro shortages as an opportunity and that there's a market to import taro. In Australia, there's a Taro Growers Association 2 comprised of 50 farmers and increasing. There are considerations for the government to assist in funding for mechanization to increase production for the farmers. They also hold conferences and are looking at research to deal with the Samoan leaf blight and other diseases that may affect their industry. There's also taro from China that is supplying McDonald's taro pie and they probably would prefer to have Hawaiian taro for better marketing and public relations. . In my perspective, every farmer, whether big or small, full time or part time, works hard and I respect them for continuing this way of life. In doing so, this is the farmers' satisfaction, having the consumers enjoy our product. Statistics show the declining trend for taro farming in Hawaii and the taro farmers need help and are asking for help so that you will not say to us, \"Why didn't you tell us?\" And what will be the answer when the poi consumers ask, \"Where's our poi, So let's support our Hawaii taro farmers so that there will be Hawaiian taro and poi in the future and not taro from Australia, China, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico and the largest exporter of taro at this time (THP) supports HB 1663 (HDl) prohibiting the development. , testing, propagation, release. importation, planting, or growing of genetically modified only on 'H'aroa1;~n T(~ln ami \"\" exporter of Hawaiian Premium papayas to CONUS and Japan and represents over 50 papaya grow~rs.

It is imperative that we the people of the State of Hawaii do not turn our backs on any agricultural research possibilities. We must be thoughtful and diligent in our quest for knowledge and allow those with the expertise to use their knowledge and experience to better our lives through research. We would not summarily dismiss medical research that could save lives, why would we close the door on agricultural research that has the possibility to improve or save lives. Respectfully, %z.thg. cfian.c.ock Mycogen SECURITY DATE: :45pm PLACE: Conference Room 225 TO: FROM: Committee on Energy and Environment Senator Mike Gabbard, Chair Senator J. Kalani English, Vice Chair Lisa Gibson President Hawaii Science & Technology Council RE: HB1663 DD1-Support for Compromises Offered Aloha Chair, Vice Chair, and Members of the Committee, The Hawaii Science & Technology Council is aware of the spiritual and cultural significance of taro in Hawaii and believes that the compromises offered in HB1663HDI provide a foundation upon which constructive work on known threats to taro can be conducted. However, from previous testimony on this bill we understand that the most significant issues affecting taro in Hawaii, invasive species and diseases associated with imported taro and issues related to agriculture such as access to land, reduced numbers of farmers, water quality and loi health, are not being addressed by this legislation. The Hawaii Science & Technology Council must reiterate that research is not the problem nor is it a threat to Hawaiian taro. Nonetheless, the Hawaii Science & Technology Council supports the compromise language of HB1663HDI that prohibits the genetic modification of any Hawaiian taro varieties and restricts genetic modification and testing of non-Hawaiian taro to enclosed laboratories where entry into such a laboratory is prohibited to the general public. The Hawaii Science & Technology Council (HISciTech) is a 501(c)6 industry association with a 28-member board. HISciTech serves Hawaii companies engaged in ocean sciences, agricultural biotechnology, astronomy, defense aerospace, biotech/life sciences, information & communication technology, energy, environmental technologies, and creative media. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. Sincerely, Lisa H. Gibson President 733 Bishop Street, Suite 2950 Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 808.536.4670 phone I a i keia hanauna. Our spirit of being is nurtured from generation to generation. Testimony in SUPPORT ofHB1663, and in OPPOSITION TO HB1226 March 4, 2009 Aloha kakou elected lawmakers, Ke Kula 0 Samuel Manaiakalani Kamakau is a Hawaiian immersion charter school located in Kane' ohe Hawai' i. Our school focuses on educating our future leaders and community members with an emphasis on some key principles and Hawaiian values including: Malama' Aina, Stewardship of the Land. Malama Kino, Health Wellness. 'Ai Pono, Healthy Diet. We the 'Uo Mamo, or Board of Directors comprised of representatives consisting of school faculty including school director, teachers, support staff, parents, students and community members of Ke Kula 0 S.M. Kamakau firmly request that you, the lawmakers elected to represent us, support legislation imposing a ban on Gentically Modified and Gentically Engineered taro of ALL varieties oftaro (colocasia esculenta) in Hawaii, and oppose any legislation preempting genetic modification at any level in Hawai'i. Our request is validated on several levels. 1. Genetically engineered taro has not been proven safe for our environment and cross contamination will pose unnecessary risks to our 'aina as well as to our native varieties oftaro. 2. Gentically modified and engineered products have not been proven safe for human consumption and also poses a threat to the well known hypo allergenic properties of taro (see reference attached). 3. Genetic engineering ofkalo or taro is disrespectful to Hawaiian values and beliefs. As an educational organization that utilizes taro farming, preparation and consumption as key components of our curriculum, our concerns are great regarding this issue. As an educational program that has hopes to restore one of the largest know lo'i or wetland taro patches in the area of Ha'iku, our recognition as taro farmers and exponential amounts of future taro farmers are undeniable. The purity and integrity of taro is extremely valuable if not vital to the future of many of our lessons to be taught. We SUPPORT legislation as indicated in HB 1663 banning genetic modification of ALL taro vaieties in Hawai'i, and OPPOSE legislation as indicated in HB 1226 gmo preemption bill, for the same reasons Piha, Ke Kula 0 Samuel Manaiakalani Kamakau 'UoMamo SEE ATTACHED REFERENCE Dona, A. and I.S.

Arvanitoyannis. 2009. Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition. 49:2,164-175 Overview Need for testing Effects on animal growth Effect on gastrointenstinal tract Effects on the liver Effect on pancreas Effect on the blood Effects on the immune system Effect on biochemical parameters Mortality Developmental effect on fetus, babies Pleitropic and insertional effects (when genes influences multiple traits, thus one mutation such as from gmos can affect all traits) Gmo growth hormone in milk, effect on host animal Gmo growth hormone in milk, IGF effect on human health Pigs expressing human growth hormone GMpigs On antinutrients On potential transfer to the gut Allergic responses Bt expressed in many crops, farm workers exposed to First, the authors challenge the concept of \"substantial equivalence,\" which was used as a justification by the FDA to deregulate several key GM crops:\"Substantial equivalence\" may provide some theoretical points background in predicting toxicity, but in practice the only reliable way to evaluate the toxicity of a GM food is through toxicity tests on animals. Furthermore, it has been argued that GM foods should be subjected to the same testing and approval procedures as medicines (Le., clinical trials) since they must be adequate to ensure that any possibility of an adverse effect on human health from a GM food can be detected.\"On the premise that GM crops are safe because no evidence exists to the contrary this article indicates that:\"In the absence of adequate safety studies, the lack of evidence that GM food is unsafe cannot be interpreted as proof that it is safe.\" Also:\"The results of most of the rather few studies conducted with GM foods indicate that they may cause hepatic, pancreatic, renal, and reproductive effects and may alter hematological, biochemical, and immunologic parameters the significance of which remains unknown. The above results indicate that many GM food have some common toxic effects. Therefore, further studies should be conducted in order to elucidate the mechanism dominating this action.\" Also:\"Small amounts of ingested DNA may not be broken down under digestive processes and there is a possibility that this DNA may either enter the bloodstream or be excreted, especially in individuals with abnormal digestion as a result of chronic gastrointestinal disease or with immunodeficiency\" 2 Need for testing \"The toxicity tests should comply with the guidelines for toxicity testing of drugs. It should be emphasized that since these GM foods are going to be consumed by every human being they should be tested even more thoroughly than drugs and more experiments are required in order to study the possible toxicity and make any conclusions.\" Also:\"postmarketing surveillance should be part of the overall safety strategy for allergies, especially of high-risk groups such as infants and individuals in \"atopic\" families\" Effects on animal growth Body weight might be significantly altered as it has been shown with the consumption of Mon863 corn (Seralini et aI., 2007) and GM rice on rats (Li et aI., 2004). Effect on gastrointenstinal tract Stomach erosion and necrosis were reported in rats fed with flavr-savr GM tomatoes, while GM potatoes expressing Galanthus nivalis (GNA) lectin induced proliferative growth in their stomach which is of particular importance if one takes into consideration that glomelular stomach erosions can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage, especially in the elderly and patients on nonsteroidal anti\u00ad inflammatory agents (Pusztai et aI., 2003). Intestines may also be affected by GM food consumption as it has already been shown with GM potatoes expressing Bt toxin which caused the disruption, multinucleation, swelling, and increased degradation of ileal surface cells in rats (Fares and EI-Sayed, 1998), GM potatoes expressing gna which induced proliferative growth in the small-large intestines (Ewen and Pusztai, 1999a) and GM soybean type Roundup Ready _ R which caused moderate inflammation in the distal intestine of salmons (Bakke\u00ad McKellep et aI. 2007).\"Also:\"Binding to surface carbohydrates of the mouse jejunum was also revealed with CrylAc protoxin of the Cry genes, the most common terminators applied in currently approved crops (Vazquez-Padron et aI., 2000). According to Pusztai et aI. (2003) since it is the genetic manipulation process itself which led to toxicity, similar hazards might be seen in animals or humans fed genetically-manipulated soya, canola, and corn over a long period of time (i.e., years or decades). The chronic inflammation and proliferative effect that may be caused by some GM plants on the gastrointestinal tract may lead after years to cancer. Effects on the liver As for the effects of GM food on liver there are only a few long-term studies. It has been found that GM soya can alter the cell structure and functioning of the liver in mice reversibly (Malatesta et aI., 2002; 2003; 2005) and can cause changes in histomorphology (Ostaszewska et aI., 2005) and the protein profile of the liver in rainbow trout (Martin et aI., 2003). Alterations have also been observed in hepatic enzymes after consumption of raw rice expressing GNA lectin (Poulsen et aI., 2007), GM Bt with vegetative insecticidal protein gene (Peng et aI., 2007) and in DuPont's subchronic feeding study in rats fed diets containing GM corn 1507 (MacKenzie et aI., 2007). These alterations in hepatocyte cells and enzymes may be indicative of hepatocellular damage. Consumption of Mon863 corn in rats led to increase in trigycerides in females (Seralini et aI., 2007). Effect on pancreas GM soybean has also an impact on pancreas, since changes occurred in pancreatic acinar cells 3 of mice and a high synthetic rate of zymogen granules containing low amounts of _-amylase (Malatesta et aI., 2003). \"Effect on kidneys\"Another target organ of some GM crops is the kidney. Smaller kidneys were developed in DuPont's study in rats fed diets containing GM corn 1507 (MacKenzie et aI., 2007), whereas consumption of Mon863 corn in rats led to lower urine phosphorus and sodium excretion in male rats. There were also small increases in focal inflammation and tubular degenerative changes characteristic of a classic chronic progressive nephropathy (Seralini et aI., 2007). Rats fed GNA rice had elevated creatinine plasma concentration either due to some kind of renal effect or the increased water consumption in order to excrete the excess iron in the GNA rice diet (Poulsen et aI., 2007). Salmons fed GM soybean had higher head kidney lysozyme and higher acid phosphatase activities (Bakke-McKellep et aI., 2007). Effect on the blood Response variables were observed in animals fed with GM crops. DuPont's study in rats fed diets containing GM corn 1507 showed a decrease in red blood cell count and hematocrit of females (MacKenzie et aI., 2007) while GM corn Mon863 affected the development of blood with fewer immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) and changes in blood chemistry in rats (Seralini et aI., 2007). Bt with VIP insecticidal protein gene caused a decrease in platelets, monocytes ratio in female rats, and an increase in the granulocytes ratio in male rats (Peng et aI., 2007). Effects on the immune system As for the effects of GM crops on the immune system an increase in the production of Cry9C\u00ad specific IgG and IgG 1 in rats and mice fed with GM heat-treated corn CBH351 was observed (Teshima et aI., 2002) because the Cry gene possesses immunogenic properties as it was shown by Vazquez\u00ad Padron et (1999). Serum IgG mediates the allergen enhanced IgG Abs activates the IgG response (van Neerven et aI., 1999) thereby indicating the occurrence of an allergic reaction having occurred, although Germolec et ai. (2003) suggest that antigen specific IgG does not correlate to clinical allergy. Moreover, GM corn Mon863 caused higher white blood cell levels in male rats (Seralini et aI., 2007). DuPont's sub chronic feeding study in rats fed diets containing GM corn 1507 showed that eosinophils concentration in females was decreased (MacKenzie et aI., 2007). Rats given a diet based on GNA rice showed enlargement of the lymph nodes, and decreased weight of the mesenteric and of the female adrenal lymph nodes which may be indicative of an immune toxic response (Poulsen et aI., 2007). Effect on biochemical parameters Subchronic feeding of GNA rice in rats resulted in decrease in glucose, while cholesterol, trigyceride, and HDLD concentration were higher (Poulsen et aI., 2007). Mortality An increased mortality was observed in rats fed with GM tomatoes since seven out of forty rats died within two weeks without any explanation (Pusztai et aI., 2003). Developmental effect on fetus, babies Food-ingested M13 DNA fed to pregnant mice, was detected in various organs of fetuses and newborn animals, suggesting a possible transfer through the transplacental route (Doerfler and Schubbert, 1998). Maternally ingested foreign DNA could be a potential mutagen for the developing fetus. Birthrates of piglets fed GM corn in Iowa country displayed an 80% fall due to high levels of Fusarium mold (Strieber, 2002), although it has been claimed that Bt corn expressing Cry proteins is 4 less contaminated with mycotoxins (Weil, 2005). A Russian rat study reported very high death rates in the young of rats fed GM soya (56% died) in stunted growth in the surviving progeny (Ermakova, 2005). A study of GM rice expressing Xa21 on the development of rat embryos showed that there was an increase in the body weight gain of pregnant rats, the body weight, body length, and tail length of fetal rats (Li et aI., 2004) whereas GM rice expressing cowpea trypsin inhibitor caused an increase in the male rats' body length and in the female rats' red blood cell number, hemoglobin, and monocyte number (Zhuo et aI., 2004).\" Pleitropic and insertional effects (when genes influences multiple traits, thus one mutation such as from gmos can affect all traits): \"Concern has been expressed about the above potential effects which might cause the silencing of genes, changes in their level of expression or, potentially, the turning on of existing genes that were not previously being expressed (Conner and Jacobs, 1999). This interaction with the activity of the existing genes and biochemical pathways of plants, may lead to disruption of metabolism in unpredictable ways and to the development of new toxic compounds or an increase of the already existing ones as it happened with two genetically produced foods, tryptophan and g-linolenic acid (Hill etaI., 1993; Sayanova et aI., 1997). Moreover, research into epigenetics has also revealed that genes account for only a part of the control of the biochemistry of organisms, and organisms have a level of control above genes that interact with genes explaining why genetic engineering is so unpredictable, with different results produced by each attempt and why the products are often unstable. The possibility that an unidentified compound may be present in the GM food makes crucial that each transgenic food as whole food and not as a single protein should be tested directly for toxicity in animals, although as Kuiper et ai. (2004) state there are limitations in establishing dose-response relationships.\" Gmo growth hormone in milk, effect on host animal The use of rbGH in dairy cattle in order to increase milk yield has caused large controversy. Problems occurring such as an increase in mastitis may pose a risk to human health since the increased antibiotic use leads to antibiotic residues in milk (Epstein, 1996). Adverse effects in cows have been observed including lameness, mastitis, subclinical ketosis, an increase in embryonic loss and abortion, a decrease in final pregnancy rates, as well as a decrease in birth rate (Dohoo et aI., 2003). It should be noted that lameness has also been reported in studies with transgenic pigs genetically engineered to carry human and bovine growth hormone genes (Pursel et aI., 1989). Gmo growth hormone in milk, IGF effect on human health The consumption of milk from cows injected rbGH leads to an increase in IGF-I in humans, since IGF-l survives digestion (Xian et aI., 1995). The oral free IGF-l feeding studies in rats sponsored by Monsanto and Elanco looked at by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 1992 had ambiguous results since neither used IGF-l associated with its binding proteins, which are resistant to acidic conditions and may enable IGF-l to survive digestion in the stomach. Moreover, IGF-l is protected from digestion by the major milk protein casein (Hansen et aI., 1997) and the milks buffering effect (Xian et ai. 1995). Moreover, Monsanto's 90-day rat study which had previously shown that rbGH \"is not orally active in rats\" was re-examined and it was found that rbGH elicited a primary antigenic response meaning that rbGH was absorbed intact from the gut (Eppard et aI., 1997). The full significance of human exposure to rbGH and IGF-l is unknown, particularly in the neonate, the sUbpopulation at greatest risk (Morris, 1999). According to Chan (1998), at least some of the absorbed IGF-I can effectively stimulate the proliferation of cancer cells. The increased levels ofIGF-I in humans predict increased rates in colon, breast, and prostate cancer, since they stimulate the indolent 5 slowly growing tumor cells that appear in an aging individual resulting in clinical cancer necessarily old. On the other hand, FDA states that this potential does not exist since any increase ofIOF-I in milk is much lower than the physiological amount produced in the organism. These concerns about the consumption of milk from cows injected rbOH may be carried also to other animals such as pigs expressing human OH, pigs injected recombinant porcine somatotropin (rpST), and OH transgenic salmon. Pigs expressing human growth hormone Transgenic pigs expressing human OH showed dramatic effects in growth rates, feed conversion, and body composition, but exhibited serious side effects that were attributable to the high level of OH expression (Pursel et aI., 1989). Repeated injections of rpST can also produce altered lipid composition similar to that of the OH transgenic pigs (Solomon et aI., 1997).Orowth hormone on fish However, when the fish growth hormone (OM) gene is introduced in salmon may OH circulation may elevate by 40-fold, leading to enlarged skulls and impair feeding and respiration (Dunham and Devlin, 1999). Experiments should be conducted in animals being fed OH transgenic salmon and other fish in order to examine whether the consumption of OH transgenic fish expressing high levels of OH will increase the levels of IOFI and lead to the same health risks as rbOH milk. It should be emphasized that as in milk there is a possibility that the presence of other proteins in the fish tissue may protect IOF-1 from digestion, which remains to be demonstrated in animal studies. GM pigs The experiment of Saeki et al. (2004) with pigs containing spinach desaturase gene which converts saturated fat into the unsaturated fat linoleic acid resulted in a high degree of mortality in founders and the F 1 generation. Increased mortality might have been due to a random integration process where the trans gene can insert in and damage any active gene locus (insertional mutagenesis) or to the significant alteration in the embryonic lipid profile caused by the trans gene. The porcine embryo is unique in its high intracellular lipid content, which is associated with its sensitivity against freezing or in vitro production (Niemann and Rath, 2001). We strongly believe that the same toxicity could occur if the pregnant pigs were fed only the new source of glinolenic acid obtained from transgenic canola or of any future modified crop, since it alters the percentage of 18:2n-6 in liver (Palombo et aI., 2000). We should be aware that any change in the lipidprofile of liver can also result in changes in metabolism with unexpected consequences. On antinutrients \"The insertion of a new gene can sometimes lead to increase in existing levels of anti-nutrients, some of which cannot be reduced with heat treatment (Bakke-McKellep et aI., 2007). One of the most widely available commercial OM products nowadays glyphosate-resistant Roundup Ready _ R soybean may display an increase in anti-nutrients (Padgette et aI., 1996). Heat-stable anti-nutrients such as phytoestrogens, glucinins, and phytic acid were also found to cause infertility problems in sheep and cattle (Liener, 1994), allergenic reactions and binding to phosphorus and zinc thereby making them unavailable to the animal respectively (Adams, 1995). An increase in the anti-nutrient level should not be accepted since a OM food may be consumed as raw material.\" On potential transfer to the gut \"short DNA fragments of OM plants have been detected in white blood cells and in milk of cows and in chicken and mice tissues that had been fed OM corn and soybean, respectively (Beever and Kemp, 2000; Einspainer et aI., 2001; Hohlweg and Doerfler, 2001; Phipps and Beever, 2001). Furthermore, fragments of recombinant crylAb gene were detected in the gastrointestinal tract of 6 Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) 11 corn-fed pigs but not in the blood (Chowdhury et aI., 2003). Therefore, it seems plausible that small amounts of ingested DNA are not broken down under physiological digestive processes. The fact that fragments of transgenic genes may not be detected in blood but can be detected in tissues of animals by PCR, underlies that they are in quite low levels in circulation and more sensitive methods of detection are needed (Puztai 2001). Moreover, Murray and his coworkers (2007) showed that not all PCR assays can detect DNA in extractions of shortly cooked corn, making the interpretation of the results from PCR even more difficult. These limitations in the detection of GM DNA should make us reconsider the view that gene transfer cannot occur, which falls in agreement with the findings of Nether wood et al. (2004) that transgene from GM soya survived passage through the small bowel in human ileostomists. According to Flachowsky (2005) the uptake of GM DNA into cells of the gastrointestinal tract will normally have no biological consequences because the DNA will be degraded in the cell. The question is whether it can be degraded in patients with severe gastrointestinal diseases. In the unlikely event that the DNA is recombined into a host chromosome, the probability that it will exert any biological effect on that cell remains unknown.\" Allergic responses \"The introduction of novel proteins into foods such as a GM soybean variety expressing methionine from Brazil nut (Nordlee et aI., 1996) and GE corn variety modified to produce a Bt endotoxin, Cry9C (Bernstein et aI., 2003) may elicit potentially harmful immunological responses, including allergic hypersensitivity (Conner et aI., 2003; Taylor and Hefle, 2002). Moreover, according to Prescott et al. (2005) the introduction of a gene expressing nonallergenic protein such as GM field pea, expressing alpha-amylase inhibitor-I, may not always result in a product without allergenicity. This study underlines the need to evaluate new GM crops on a case-to-case basis and to improve the screening requirements for GM plants. Brassica juncea, another GM plant, expressing choline oxidase gene caused low IgE response in mice and a cross-reactive epitope search showed a stretch similar to Hev b 6 having some antigenic properties although according to Singh et ai. (2006) it had no allergenicity. These findings should be more carefully interpreted and repeated in other animal series in order to elucidate whether IgE response may playa role in toxicity. As for Bt expressed in many crops, farm workers exposed to Bt pesticide may develop skin sensitization and IgG antibodies to the Bt spore extraction (Bernstein et ai., 2003).\"Effects on animal growthBody weight might be significantly altered as it has been shown with the consumption of Mon863 corn (Seralini et ai., 2007) and GM rice on rats (Li et aI., 2004). Dona, A. and I.S. Arvanitoyannis. 2009. Health Risks of Genetically Modified Foods. Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition. 49:2,164-175 7 Bt Cotton: weaving a web of infertility PRESS RELEASE Feb 24, 2009 A recent survey conducted by Navdanya reveals shocking statistics of dramatic decreases in microorganisms and beneficial soil enzymes in the soil of Bt Cotton fields. The study comes amid controversial government attempts to commercially introduce Bt Brinjal into India, despite consistent opposition and growing evidence of the negative impact genetically modified organisms have on society, human health and the environment. Numerous studies have linked farmer suicides in India to Bt Cotton due to increased costs of agricultural inputs and falling market prices, resulting in insurmountable debts and desperation. Various other studies have found high rates of infertility in rats that are fed GMO products, animal deaths after grazing on GMO fields and butterfly deaths after feeding on Bt corn pollen. This study now provides damning evidence of the environmental degradation caused by Bt crops, as the crop literally kills organisms in the soil that make available the nutrients plants need to grow, a frightening trend that can lead to large scale desertification . Irregardless of these warning signs and significant opposition, European governments as well are trying to push through a GMO corn variety, Mon81 O. We demand that an international moratorium be placed in commercialization of GMO crops until there has been more studies conducted to confirm its safety to human health as well as the environment. Navdanya's study was conducted in Bt cotton growing areas of Vidharbha, comparing the microbial biomass in the soil of Bt cotton fields with that of fields that grew other crops or other types of cotton. The survey found statistically significant drops in 2 microbes and 3 beneficial enzymes. These results are significant as it provides scientific evidence that Bt Cotton is making the soil infertile by decreasing microbial activity, and thus essentially killing the very soil that the crop is grown in. Additionally this proves that industrial agriculture creates a relentless cycle of despair as industrial agricultural products deteriorate soil fertility that then necessitates intensified fertilizer and agricultural application, which ultimately results in increased farmer's costs and soaring debts. It is interesting to note that the study was conducted in a region which has shown an alarmingly high rate of farmer suicides, a shocking 20,000 in the past 5 years. Finally, the fact that Bt cotton crops decreases microbial activity in the soil portends a future of sterile soil that may result in massive desertification and loss of arable land in the future in a time where food security is evermore essential. The microbes with most significant drops are as follows Actinomycetes(17% decrease), Bacteria(14.2%), Dehydrogenase(10.3%) Acid Phosphatase(26.6%) and Nitrogenase(22.6%). Actinomycetes play an important role in decomposition of organic materials, and thus provide a vital part in organic matter turnover and carbon cycles that replenish the supply of nutrients in the soil and is an important part of humus formation. Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients, contributing to many important steps in nutrient cycles, such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction. Dehydrogenase enzymes play a significant role in the biological oxidation of soil and increase beneficial microbial activity. Acid phosphatase enzymes are used by soil microorganisms to access organically bound phosphate nutrients, which make phosphates available to plants. Nitrogenase is the enzyme used by some organisms to fix atmospheric nitrogenous gas. It is the only known family of enzymes which accomplishes this process.

An Affiliate a/the Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation and the American Farm Bureau Federation March 18, 2009 Committee on Energy & Environment HB1663 HDI to be heard on Thursday, March 19, 2009 at 3:45 p.m. in Room 225 Attn: Senators Mike Gabbard, Chairman and Kalani English, Vice Chairman In regards to HB 1663 HD 1, (taro bm), the Molokai Farm Bureau would like to ask that you pass out the bill \"as is.\" Because the Farm Bureau supports the needs of conventional, biotech and organic farmers, bills such as this just tend to divide the agricultural community; this compromise bill should ease some of the unwarranted tension. We value and respect the spiritual and cultural significance of taro to native Hawaiians, many of whom live here on Molokai. This bill addresses those concerns raised by the Native Hawaiian community. Taro has been decimated in many parts of the world, including Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and the Solomon Islands, from diseases, pests, and global \u00b7warming. This bill allows these countries to continue to seek out the expeltise of Hawaii's researchers because they see the value in the tools of biotechnology to address the many agricultural challenges in their regions. Activists have said: \"Hopefully this moratorium will lead to not only a BAN on GMO taro, but ALL GMOs in Hawaii and elsewhere.\" HB 1663 HD 1. clarifies that this is not a referendum on biotechnology and should not be used to further the extreme anti-GMO agendas of a vocal minority by banning research on ALL varieties of taro. For these reasons, we ask that you please honor the compromise offered in the House Draft. Respectfully yours, Donald G. Maum President, Molokai Farm Bureau From: Sent: To: 20094:04 PM ENETestimony Testimony on House Bill 1663, March 19, 3:45PM, Rm. 225, Committee on Energy and the Environment Dear Senator Gabbard and committee members, Please pass HB 1663 as is. This bill respects the spiritual and cultural significance of taro to native Hawaiians. This bill address those concerns raised by the Native Hawaiian community. HB 1663 HD 1 clarifies that this is not a referendum on biotechnology and should not be used to ban research on all varieties of taro. Please honor the compromise offered in HB 1663.

Some of the Kupuna of Kawaihapai were Taro (Kalo) mahiai (farmers) and were Cultural Informants for Bishop Museum who provided information about Waialua Moku: The Hawaiian Planter by E. S. -Page 85 \"Kaaimoku Kekulu (sic: Kaaemoku Kakulu), native of the district says that the name of spring and the terrace section noted above is Kaaiea.\" Kawaihapai. \"There is a sizable area of terraces in the lowlands (now surrounded by sugar cane), watered by Kawaihapai Stream. These terraces have evidently been lying fallow for some time, though several were being plowed for rice or taro in the summer of 1935. At the foot of the \"Cliffs, watered by a stream the name of which was not learned, are several small terraces in which taro is grown by David Keaau (sic: David Keao).\" It's not needed to improve taro (kalo) thru Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) because our ancestors had a more traditional, effective and respectful way regarding this matter for many generations.

The Hawaii Crop Improvement Association (HCIA) is a nonprofit trade association representing the agricultural seed industry in Hawaii. Now the state's largest agricultural commodity, the seed industry contributes to the economic health and diversity of the islands by providing high quality jobs in rural communities, keeping important agricultural lands in agricultural use, and serving as responsible stewards of Hawaii's natural resources. As stated in previous years, HCIA member companies do not grow taro nor do we have an interest in taro as a commercial research and development crop. We consistently affirm and respect the cultural meaning of Hawaiian taro and firmly believe that the Hawaiian community must lead the discussion of the future of Hawaiian taro, and Hawaiian taro research and education programs. Legislating a moratorium on taro or any other agricultural crop grown in Hawaii sends a chilling message that Hawaii is not in support of science and technology. It undermines future investments and growth potential for responsible use of agricultural biotechnology as a 21 st Century tool for farmers. We stand firmly on the thousands of science-based and peer reviewed studies and 3,400 scientists around the world that attest to the safety of agricultural biotechnology. (The Safety of Agricultural Biotechnology study listing is available upon request) Plant research using this technology is not only safe but has the advantage of being more efficient. It requires significantly less time to produce new cultivars and is more precise than traditional plant breeding. As a result, varieties can be developed which are more productive and better adapted to local needs. It is an option or tool for plant breeding when other methods fail. Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony. GMO TARO-A TARO FARMER'S PERSPECTIVE Aloha, my name is Jim Cain, my family and I farm taro in Waipi'o Valley, island of Hawai'i. We also own and operate a family-run poi shop, King Laulau Brand Poi, where we process the taro we grow on our 6 acre farm, as well as taro we obtain from other farmers, providing poi for our Big Island community. I stand united with all the farmers ofWaipi'o and strongly oppose the genetic modification oftaro. My opposition to genetic engineering of taro is based on cultural, economic, and nutritional concerns. The cultural concerns relating to the genetic manipulation of kalo cannot be overstated. Kalo's position as a high ranking family member in Hawaiian cosmology reflect deep rooted cultural values. These values, reinforced by kalo's role as a kinolau of Kane, show reverent respect for the natural world and kalo's ability to sustain and nourish people. These sacred family relationships can be traced back centuries to the very beginnings of Hawaiian culture, and every week when I deliver poi to my loyal customers, I am reminded of the importance of this ancestral food and its ability to nourish physically as well as spiritually. Genetic manipulation of Haloa shows utter disrespect for Hawaiian culture. In addition, recent attempts to patent and own taro hybrids derived from Hawaiian cultivars of taro are a cultural violation of these precious gifts that have been handed down to us generation to generation and are a direct link to our past. Economically, genetic modification poses several risks to taro farmers and the poi industry. In recent years, there have been efforts to hybridize new varieties oftaro in an attempt to produce disease resistance and increased yields. Cultivars of taro have been brought to Hawai'i from many places in the taro growing world to hybridize with Hawaiian varieties. After showing some initial promise, extensive testing by poi processors has shown that these hybrids produce inferior quality poi. Also, foreign cultivars oftaro such as Palauan have been introduced into lo'i all around the state. While high-yielding, these varieties produce a low quality poi. Farmers have been left with no market for their crop, which takes over a year to produce, as poi millers universally reject these inferior taros. Subsequently, the availability ofhuli ofthe preferred Hawaiian varieties has been reduced. This has created both short-term and long-term economic hardships for taro farmers and poi processors and has contributed to the recent shortage of poi. Of primary concern is the very real danger of contamination. A genetically engineered taro huli will look identical to the original Hawaiian variety from which it is derived. Once released into the lo'i, either controlled or by accident, recall will be impossible. Should problems arise, the effects of this contamination would be devastating to our industry. A history of contamination of other food crops world-wide by GE varieties has proven that containment, despite the reassurances of the bio-tech industry, is impossible. Another economic concern of taro farmers is the issue of patenting of taro varieties. The traditional system of sharing huli between farmers is a proven way of ensuring the availability of planting material. The introduction of GE taro would seriously disrupt the ability of farmers to share huli and reduce the availability of suitable planting material. ':A Recent attempts by the University of Hawai'i to patent and sell huli to farmers is seen as an unacceptable precedent to make money off those who can least afford it. The bio\u00ad tech industry is not here for community service, but is predicated on the goal of controlling the incredibly profitable seed supply. Nutritionally, poi has a world-wide reputation as a pure and healthy complex carbohydrate. There are no known allergies to poi, it is a food that can be assimilated by anyone. As a poi maker, I am honored to provide this nutritious food to babies whose parents use our poi as the first food to nourish their children, to elders who have been eating poi all their life, and to a wide range of people in between. Also, poi plays such an important role in celebrating families' life events such as baby lu'aus, graduations, weddings and funerals. A lu'au is not complete without poi on the table. Genetic engineering of taro consists of imposing genes from other plants such as rice and wheat into taro's DNA. The resulting changes could have untold effects on the hypo-allergenic qualities of taro and poi. When researchers are asked if they can guarantee the safety of their work, they honestly answer no. The dangers posed to the nutritional quality of this ancestral staff of life are completely unacceptable. From my perspective as a Waipi'o taro farmer and poi processor, the disagreement over this issue is really a clash of values. University researchers value and are concerned about their perceived right to academic freedom. The bio-tech industry values and is concerned about their perceived right to unregulated free-market economics. Waipi'o, where I come from, is a very traditional Hawaiian valley. The still intact protocols and values that have been handed down are based on the value of Kuleana-rights that are based in the concept of responsibility. While moving forward, it is important to remember our connection to the past. That is why, in Waipi'o, the titles that garner the most respect are not Dr. or Professor, but begin with Auntie or Uncle or Tutu. It is important to note that the UH researcher responsible for the GE research on taro has never even been to Waipi'o Valley. Technology is seen as a tool not as a guiding principle. Science can be a wonderful tool for advancement, but science without a conscience, without the guidance of the precautionary principle, can wreak havoc. There must be a balance. In other words, Go easy. Be respectful. In these troubled times of global warming, resource depletion, and world-wide unrest, the buzz word in Hawai'i has become sustainability. Reducing our dependence on off\u00ad island petro-chemical control, and becoming self-sufficient in food production are of huge concern. The proven methods of producing taro and poi can be seen as a model for the future of sustainable agriculture in Hawai'i. Producing taro with little or no outside resources, and providing food for our local population is a practice that has a track record that is centuries old in Hawai'i and stretches back many thousands of years in the history of mankind. It is vitally important that we support farmers who are feeding our local population. The decline oftaro production can be seen as a mirror duplicating the problems of self-sufficient food production in Hawai'i. The problems are rooted in availability of land and water and re-elevating the job of farmer to a viable occupation and way of life. Claims made by the bio-tech industry of impending devastating diseases are seen as scare tactics. Any good farmer knows that the key to crop health is soil fertility and it is in this direction we should be focusing our policies and research efforts. These are not new concepts, but lessons handed down to us from our kupuna. We just need to listen. There is nothing wrong with our Hawaiian taros. They were developed over centuries by some of the most respected farmers the world has ever known. The sad decline in the number of varieties of taro that was grown by our ancestors has nothing to do with disease, but lies in the fact that, over the last century, people have moved off the land and instead of growing their food, are now buying all their food. In the interest of Hawai'i's long term security we need to reverse this practice. Support for the passage ofHB 1663 and SB709 that calls for a ban on the genetic engineering oftaro in Hawai'i has swelled as people have become educated about this issue. The Hawaiian community, the taro farming community, and the poi eating community will continue to be passionately vocal in their efforts to protect Haloa. This will not go away because this is ohana. Precedence for the careful regulation of biotechnology has been established at every level of government world-wide, and it is important that the decision makers in Hawai'i educate themselves about the risks associated with this potentially dangerous technology. In conclusion, I advise people that the best way to identify a taro farmer is to look at their feet. No can help, us taro farmers have ugly feet, it's an occupational hazard. So when someone claims to be speaking in the interest of the taro farmers, look at their feet. Look at who they represent. Please support our local farmers. Please malama Haloa. Jim B.D. 1 (prohibition against genetically modified Hawaiian taro) Committee: The Senate Committee on Energy and Environment Senator Mike Gabbard, Chair Senator J. Kalani English, Vice-Chair Hearing: March 19,2009 at 3:45 p.m., Conference room 225 Name: My name is Dr. Susan C. Miyasaka. I am an Agronomist and Interim County Administrator, College of Tropical Agriculture & Human Resources, University of Hawaii -Manoa, but I am testifying today as a private citizen. I was the lead scientist in a now-completed research project to genetically engineer Chinese taro Bun long for improved disease resistance. I was born and raised in Hawaii. I grew up eating laulau and poi, and I respect all the diverse cultures found in Hawaii. Reasons to vote for HB 1663 H.D. 1: 1. Research to improve disease resistance of taro using all available technologies is needed: House Bill 1663 H.D. 1 will allow laboratory-based research of non-Hawaiian taro using all available technologies to improve disease resistance. My research team has found that insertion of an oxalate oxidase gene from wheat into Chinese taro variety Bun long resulted in genetically engineered (GE) lines that completely stopped the spread of Taro Leaf Blight under laboratory conditions (see attached report). These are very promising results and House Bi1l1663 B.D. 1 will allow continued testing of these promising transgenic lines in the laboratory in Hawaii and field-testing in other states or territories. New pests and diseases enter Hawaii all the time. It may just be a matter of time before the Alomae-Bobone viral complex found in the Solomon Islands reaches Hawaii. Hawaiian taro varieties were tested in the Solomon Islands and all were killed by this viral complex. The insect vector required to transmit this viral complex is found in Hawaii. Imagine what it would do to our taro production if it reaches Hawaii. It would be foolish to throwaway any potential tools that could help to sustain taro production in Hawaii. Laboratory-based research into genetic engineering of non-Hawaiian taro will allow scientists to develop tools that could be used in the future to help save taro production in Hawaii similar to the way that genetic engineering of papaya ringspot\u00ad resistant varieties helped to save the papaya industry in Hawaii. 2. Genetic engineering research is a separate issue from commercialization: Recently, genetic engineering was used in rice to confirm that a rice gene conferred tolerance to prolonged submergence. This gene was transferred into a susceptible rice variety and it was found that tolerance to submergence increased. Then, the scientists used conventional breeding and marker-assisted selection to increase submergence tolerance of commercial rice varieties. 1 My research team now knows that an oxalate oxidase gene can confer increased tolerance to Taro Leaf Blight. Based on this research, we can look for similar genes found naturally within the taro gene pool and improve disease resistance using conventional breeding and marker-assisted selection. If a total ban on genetic engineering of all taro varieties is passed, then we will not be able to pursue such research to identify important disease resistance genes that occurs naturally within the taro gene pool. 3. There is little risk that traditional Hawaiian taro varieties will lose their genetic purity due to GE Chinese taro. Traditional Hawaiian taro varieties are grown by vegetative propagation (,hulis'). They are not grown from seed. It would be easy to maintain traditional taro varieties without a high risk of accidental transfer of disease-resistance genes from GE Chinese taro. In order for trans genes to move from GE Chinese taro to Hawaiian taro varieties, Chinese taro Bun long would need to flower and produce healthy pollen (rare event in Hawaii), then the pollen would need to move via wind or insects to a female flower in a Hawaiian taro variety, then seed capable of growing into whole plants would need to develop (rare event - I have read or heard of only 3 incidences in 70 years in Hawaii). These two rare events would need to happen simultaneously with plants in close proximity, resulting in a risk that is almost nil. In order to produce conventional crosses oftaro, breeders must hand-pollinate Hawaiian taro varieties to produce seed capable of growing into whole plants. 4. There is little risk of food safety problems or increased allergic reactions ifGE Chinese taro is commercialized. The federal government requires extensive testing that would identify and eliminate problems prior to commercialization. I am not an expert in food safety of GE crops; I defer to the experts. \"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that agricultural and food biotechnology techniques can enhance the quality, safety, nutritional value, and variety of food available for human consumption and increase the efficiency of food production, food processing, food distribution, and environmental and waste management. The American Dietetic Association encourages the government, food manufacturers, food commodity groups, and qualified food and nutrition experts to work together to inform consumers about this new technology and encourage the availability of these products in the marketplace.\" Based on scientific evidence, I believe that it is possible to have a win-win situation here. Allow pro-active research on non-Hawaiian taro varieties using all available technologies to ensure the sustainability of taro production in Hawaii. Respect Hawaiian cultural concerns by placing a ban on genetic engineering of Hawaiian taro varieties (but not all taro varieties). Please pass HB 1663 H.D. 1 as written and do not amend it to place a ban on genetic engineering of all taro varieties. 2 Update on Genetic Engineering of Chinese Taro (variety Bun long) for Increased Disease Resistance Susan C. Miyasaka Dec. 14, 2006 Why utilize genetic engineering CGE) of taro to increase disease resistance? Conventional breeding oftaro is being conducted at the University of Hawaii, and new hybrids have been developed with increased resistance to Phytophthora leaf blight. However, under weather conditions suitable for this disease organism, this resistance can break down. The taro variety shown above with leaf blight is one of the new hybrids conventionally bred for greater disease resistance. Genetic engineering offers the possibility of increased disease resistance beyond the level found within the taro germplasm. And, the taro variety remains the same genetically except for the few new genes engineered into it. The greatest success of genetic engineering of crops for increased disease resistance has been to improve viral disease resistance in plant species without any known natural resistance. For example, genetic engineering of papaya for resistance to Papaya rings pot virus has helped to save the papaya industry in Hawaii. The Alomae-Bobone viral complex is found in the Solomon Islands today, where it has wiped out 96% of the native taro varieties there and decreased taro production by 95%. Hawaiian taro varieties were tested in the Solomon Islands and all were found to be susceptible to this virus complexl.The insect vector required to transmit this virus complex is found in Hawaii. Imagine if that virus reaches Hawaii -what would it do to our taro production? Alomae, a lethal viral disease of taro, is spread by taro planthoppers. 1 s. Pacific Commission., 1978, Advisory Leaflet. 3 In the Solomon Islands, \"it is by no means certain that the crop [taro] can be reinstated to its former abundance and usage. Its day may have gone forever, as has happened in many parts of coastal Melanesia.,,2 Could this viral disease decimate taro production in Hawaii in the future? Is the movement of genes across species unnatural? No. Conventional breeding of plants and animals have moved genes across species for specific purposes, such as increased hardiness. For example, mules are the offspring of a female horse and a male donkey. And triticale is a hybrid of wheat and rye. In addition, all organisms, including humans, carry genes inserted from different species. For example, all humans carry genes that have been incorporated from viral infections. The bacterium Agrobacterium tumefasciens transfers its DNA (genetic material) into woody or herbaceous plants and causes crown gall disease. In our project, we are utilizing this naturally occurring bacterium to transfer disease resistance genes into Chinese taro. What is the progress of our project on genetic engineering of Chinese taro to increase disease resistance? Three disease resistance genes have been transferred into Chinese taro variety Bun long: 1. Oxalate oxidase gene from wheat; 2. Chitinase gene from rice; and 3. Stilbene synthase gene from grapevine. Each disease-resistance gene was transferred separately into callus (undifferentiated tissue) of variety Bun long in tissue-culture. Then, we manipulated plant hormones to produce shoots and then whole plants from the callus. Taro calli (undifferentiated tissue) Taro plantlets in tissue-culture 2 Kastom Gaden Association, Solomon Islands, 2005., People on the Edge, www.terracircle.org.au. 4 Do these disease resistance genes help Chinese taro resist pathogens? Yes, in preliminary tests using small, tissue-cultured plants. Untransformed Chinese taro (NT) infected with Phytophthora colocasiae at 12 days after inoculation. Note plant is almost dead. Chinese taro transformed with oxalate oxidase gene (g5) shows complete arrest of Phytophthora colocasiae without any diseased lesions spreading to the leaves. Chinese taro transformed with an oxalate oxidase gene completely arrested the spread of the pathogen Phytophthora colocasiae which is the organism responsible for leaf blight. In comparison, untransformed Chinese taro was almost dead at 12 days after inoculation with the pathogen. Other preliminary tests showed that Chinese taro transformed with an oxalate oxidase gene or a chitinase gene slowed the spread of the fungal pathogen Sclerotium rolfsii but the disease eventually killed the plants. How do the products of these disease resistance genes work? Oxalate oxidase catalyzes the breakdown of oxalate to produce hydrogen peroxide which inhibits growth of pathogens. Remember the hydrogen peroxide your mother used to cleanse your skinned knees? Chitin is a hard, semitransparent material that's found in the cell walls of some fungi and molds. Chitinases degrade the chitin found in the cell wall of fungal pathogens, causing the fungi to die. Stilbene synthase catalyzes the production of resveratrol, a compound that is found naturally in grapes and peanuts. Resveratrol stops the growth of fungal pathogens. Could these disease-resistance genes accidentally move from GE Chinese taro? Not likely. First, Chinese taro variety Bun long rarely flowers under the environmental conditions of Hawaii. Second, traditional Hawaiian taro varieties rarely 5 produce viable seed in Hawaii without human intervention. Taro breeders must manually move the pollen from one taro flower to another flower when its female part is ready because the insect that naturally pollinates taro flowers is not found here. Also, since taro is vegetatively propagated, it would be easy to maintain traditional taro varieties without a high risk of accidental transfer of disease-resistance genes from GE Chinese taro. How might these disease-resistance genes affect the nutrition oftaro? The health risk of GE food is so low that after more than 10 years of experience, GE crops have been grown on more than a billion acres and been consumed by millions of humans without a single negative health issue3. The federal government requires intensive testing of genetically engineered crops for possible health and environmental hazards prior to approval. The official position of the American Dietetic Association is that \"Agricultural and food biotechnology can enhance the quality, safety, nutritional value, and variety of food available for human consumption and increase the efficiency of food production, food processing, and food distribution, and environmental and waste management,,4. Did you know that if you eat cheese made in the United States, almost certainly you are eating the product of a genetically modified organism? The anti-microbial compounds produced in GE Bun long should have little negative effect on its nutrition. For example, oxalate oxidase possibly might improve the digestibility oftaro, because it breaks down oxalate, a known anti-nutritive compound that contributes to the 'itchiness' oftaro. Chitinases should have little effect on humans when consumed, because chitins are found in true fungi and insects but not in plants or mammals. Resveratrol is found in the skin of red grapes and it might improve the nutrition of GE Chinese taro due to its anti-cancer, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory effects. Of course, prior to any potential commercialization of GE Chinese taro, federal government regulations require intensive food safety tests. What are the plans for GE Chinese taro when this project terminates? The early results for increased disease resistance of GE Chinese taro appear promising, but much more research is needed. Obviously, researchers cannot state that GE Chinese taro is more disease resistant without testing plants in the greenhouse and ultimately in the field. In addition, the federal government would require tests of GE Chinese taro for food safety and environmental concerns prior to commercialization. This federally funded project on genetic engineering of Chinese taro for increased hardiness will run out of funds in early 2007. As a result of the current controversy about genetic engineering and taro, it isn't likely that future funding will be available without support from the taro industry and/or consumers in Hawaii. Without further funding, the GE Chinese taro lines either must be discarded or sent to other cooperators in the world who are willing to conduct further tests. We will lose the opportunity in Hawaii to test these promising lines for increased disease resistance. 3 International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications, 2006, Brief No. 34-2005. 4 Journal of the American Dietetic Association, Feb. 2006, p. 285-293. 6 This brief summary presents the scientific facts about potential benefits such as increased hardiness of GE Chinese taro and an evaluation of possible risks. You, as taro consumers, need to weigh the possible risks against potential benefits of GE Chinese taro. Ask yourselves what risks are acceptable to ensure that taro is here for future generations to enjoy? 7 Personal Testimony Presented Before the Senate Committee on Energy and Environment Thursday, March 19, 2009 at 3:35 p.m. by Andrew G. Hashimoto HB 1663, HD1 -RELATING TO TARO SECURITY Chair Gabbard, Vice Chair English, and Members of the Committee: My name is Andrew Hashimoto, and I serve as Dean and Director of the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR), University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am pleased to provide personal testimony on HB 1663, HD1. This testimony does not represent the position of the University of Hawaii or CTAHR. HB 1663, HD1 prohibits the development, testing, propagation, release, importation, planting, or growing of genetically modified Hawaiian taro in the State of Hawaii, and prohibits non-Hawaiian taro from being genetically modified outside an enclosed laboratory, or inside an enclosed structure unless entry is prohibited to the general public. The bill now imposes a penalty of a petty misdemeanor for violations. I support this measure as amended, as CTAHR will continue to abide by an agreement made in May 2005 that we would not conduct any transgenic research on Hawaiian taro because of its cultural significance. The safeguards specified in the bill of prohibiting entry into enclosed laboratories or enclosed structures where genetic modification of non-Hawaiian taro is conducted are acceptable conditions. Other communities in the Pacific Basin have been negatively impacted by the effects disease and other threats to non-Hawaiian taro and have sought our assistance. CTAHR works closely with land grant colleges on Guam, the Northern Marianas, American Samoa and Micronesia through the Agricultural Development in the Pacific project. A moratorium from conducting research on non-Hawaiian taro would be a great disserve to our clients and to our obligations as a land grant university. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this bill.

Personal Testimony Presented to the House Committee on Energy and Environment Thursday, March 19, 2009 by Wayne Nishijima HB1663 HD1 -RELATING TO TARO SECURITY Chair Gabbard, Vice Chair English, and Members of the Committee: My name is Wayne Nishijima, and I serve as Associate Dean and Associate Director for Cooperative Extension of the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR). I am pleased to provide personal testimony on HB1663 HD1. This testimony does not represent the position of the University of Hawai'i or CTAHR. HB 1663 HD1 protects the cultural integrity of kalo, the genetic biodiversity and integrity of Hawaiian taro varieties in the State, and establishes a ban on developing, testing, propagating, releasing, importing, planting, and growing of genetically modified Hawaiian taro in the State of Hawaii. I support this current version of the bill as it prohibits the development, testing, propagation, releasing, importation, planting or growing of genetically modified Hawaiian taro in the State of Hawaii. It also prohibits the genetiC modification of non-Hawaiian taro outside of an enclosed laboratory and that such a facility is prohibited entry by the general public. There are other places in the Pacific Region that are concerned with the effects disease and other threats to non-Hawaiian taro. We would like to continue to provide aid to and research on these non-Hawaiian taro varieties. To be prevented from using the best research technologies for taro would be a great disserve to our clients and to our obligations as a land grant university, and may eventually affect the future availability of taro. Unfortunately, research is usually not considered important until a potentially devastating problem is experienced first hand. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this bill. From: Sent: To: Cc: Testimony for 225 will be present: No by: G. Douglas Tiffany, PhD. Organization: Vice Chair Enhlish: I value and respect the spiritual and cultural significance of taro to native Hawaiians. This bill very adequately addresses those concerns raised by the Native Hawaiian community. We have seen the decimation of taro in Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and the Solomon Islands from diseases, pests, and the effects of climate change. This bill allows these countries to continue to seek out the expertise of Hawaii's Research Community because they see the value in the tools of biotechnology to address the many agricultural challenges in their smaller and less well funded communities. Activists have said: &quotjHopefully this moratorium will lead to not only a BAN on GMO taro, but ALL GMOs in Hawaii and elsewhere.&quotj HB 1663 HD 1 clarifies that this is not a referendum on biotechnology and should not be used to further the extreme anti-GMO agendas of a vocal minority by banning research on ALL varieties of taro. Senators, we must take a reasoned and balanced approach to this issue and recognize the potential global implications. If Hawaii is to take a global leadership position in technology, our hands must not be tied by idealolgies based on fear and bad science. Please honor the compromise offered in the House Draft and pass out the bill Honolulu. HI 96813 Mailing Address a non-profit 50) (c}3 working to protect the unique natural and cultural resources of the Hawaiian islands. KAHEA translates to english as \"the call.\" H.B. 1663 HD1-In Support, with amendments Senate Committee on Energy and Environment March 19, 2009, 3:45 pm, Rm. 225 Aloha mai kakou-Chair Gabbard, Vice-Chair English and Committee Members, We respectfully submit 8 volumes of testimony collected over the past month, from taro farmers and consumers across Hawaii nei, all in support of a ban on all GMO-taro. We also submit 9 published articles to substantiate the statements made below. We ask you to please consider these important points: Please AMEND the bill to protect ALL taro in Hawaii, by banning ALL GMO-taro in Hawaii. Taro is a very resilient plant that can grow, spread, flower, seed and get all mixed up in the taro patch, in the wild, and even in the lab. Even a tiny left over piece of root can grow into a full size plant. ALL GMO-taro in Hawaii would put farmers and consumers at risk of contamination as it would be inherently uncontrollable. Chinese taro, or Bun Long, is a very popularly consumed taro that is prized for lu'au leaf and taro chips, and is grown on most if not all taro farms in Hawaii. Cross-contamination of natural Bun Long by the look-alike GMO-taro of this highly consumed and farmed variety of taro, raises enormous liability concerns for farmers and producers of taro-products. It is easy to release an experiment, but impossible to control. There is no liability held, but everything is at stake. The broader public's concerns about GMO-taro are in fact, real Numerous scientific studies point to very serious health and allergy problems with GMOs, and lack of proper scientific protocols or tests of released GMOs. The biosafety dangers are real and present in this GMO experimentation and the cultural implications are already inflicting true pain in our community. There is simply no proof nor potential that such technology will be truly beneficial to consumers and to taro farming. Beyond just a business investment this issue is paramount to our community livelihood and environmental health, and for that we continue to advocate for democractic representation in the legislature, and notification and informed consent about these biosafety issues in our communities. SEE ATTACHED: -\"Catholic Healthcare West GMO Press Release 1.09\" -\"Health Risks of Genetically Modified Foods, KAMAKAU Testimony 2009\" -\"GMO Cotton Effect on Soil Biological Activities 2009\" 1 While a small number of commercial growers and poi companies oppose this ban, consumers overwhelmingly reject the idea of GMO-taro and poi. Poi consumers take the safety and quality of poi very seriously! Poi consumers are also overwhelmingly local families with strong cultural ties to taro. Allowing GMO-taro also severely threatens our ability to expand the value-added market for organic and uniquely hypo-allergenic taro products, as GMO-taro could never be guaranteed to be allergy-free and could cause allergic reactions. GMO-taro can never be certified organic. This is why GMO-taro contamination and related allergy concerns cause such great alarm to other taro businesses, as well as consumers. SEE ATTACHED: -\"Soil Association- GMOs-American Consumer Report 10.08\" There are now well over 8,000 individuals and local organizations that have been supporting the intention of this legislation since 2007. Community support for this initiative only continues to grow, uniting consumers and farmers. SEE ATTACHED: - 8 volumes of testimony collected over the past month, over a thousand letters in support of a ban on all GMO-taro. -Public testimony of over 7,000 in support from 2008 can be found online at: http:// www.capitol.hawaii.gov I session2008/lists Igetstatus.asp? query=SB9 58&showtestimony= on&currpage= 1 There are ways to engage in ethical science without genetically modifying a new organism. The state recognized the importance of addressing these issues and projects by establishing the Taro Purity and Security Task Force in 2008. Farmers and scientists must exercise due diligence in researching and developing all other options before resorting to such an extreme as creating a new organism. For example, eradication of the apple snail (another business venture gone wrong) would increase taro production by at least 25%. Assisting industrial farmers in transitioning to multi-cropping and organic fallowing techniques would also drastically increase yields. Establishing the scientific basis to explain the high yields of taro in Hawaii before industrialized farming, such as potential of kukui tree composting for fungus control. A comparative analysis of existing taro farming techniques is needed before introducing new organisms to the Hawaiian ecosystem and new risks to the taro market. SEE ATTACHED: -\"Comparison of GMO Cotton and Organic Farming 2.09\" There exist many safe methods of advancing taro farming- without GMOs. Following the taro blight that wiped out Samoan taro production in the early 1990s, in-depth studies found that such blights can be prevented by multi-cropping of taro varieties and improved farming techniques such as fallowing, wider row spacing, more careful huli selection, etc. In addition, organic methods produce remarkable increases in yields and nutritional value per acre, reflecting a true abundance of efficiency, biodiversity and advancement of soil science-- especially compared to the declines often experienced in industrialized mono-cropped fields that are treated with chemicals and are not fallowed. SEE ATTACHED: -\"Taro Industry Back on its -\"Bibliography of Taro Leaf Blight\" -\"TaroGen Publications\" 2 There are other technologically advanced ways to create new taro plants without putting public safety at risk. For example, one cutting edge technology is called Marker Assisted Selection, which speeds up the plant breeding process-\"MAS makes it possible to select traits with greater accurary and to develop a new varie!J quicker than in the pas!.\" SEE ATTACHED ARTICLE: -\"FAO study on Marker-Assisted Selection 7.07\" In this GMO debate it is certainly crucial to recognize that there do exist safer and more advanced emergency options for plant breeding. However, it is just as crucial to heed local taro industry concerns about introducing new varieties into Hawaii. Taro farmers across Hawaii do not now find this MAS technology necessary as there exists in Hawaii already a vast wealth of genetically diverse taro varieties. The introduction of new hybrids is not only unnecessary and costly but also a threat to the preservation and propagation of the existing native taro biodiversity. Additionally, due to taste and texture complaints recently introduced hybrid taros have already been rejected for poi production by local poi mills--at great cost to the farmers who had been convinced by researchers to plant those new hybrids and who then had to replant their farms with the traditional Hawaiian taros. The FAO article explains also that the MAS hybrid technology should only be used \"where there is a clear advantage over traditional selection techniques.\" In this case, the value of the technology is superficial and short term compared to the many unique and invaluable native heritage taros of Hawaii-the fortified and proven results of 1,200 years of traditional selection techniques- fine tuned to the many climates and conditions in Hawaii and to poi production. It with this native biodiversity and improved farming techniques that we can protect our farms from blights. Please, Senators, if you aren't absolute!J and proof positive that GMO-taro is better for Hawaii than natural taro and scife!J advanced farming techniques then please don't allow this experimentation to continue. If you do encounter any substantial scientific and economic proof that GMO-taro will actually provide a safe and secure benefit to Hawaii please make such information publicly available for review and discussion. Otherwise, please support the original intentions of HB 1663 to protect all varieties of taro in Hawaii, by amending HB 1663HD 1 back to its original language. Thank you for considering all this testimony, it comes from the heart and soul of Hawaii. Me ka mahalo piha, Bryna Rose Storch Community Coordinator KAHEA: The Hawaiian-Environmental Alliance 3 Comparison of BT Cotton and Organic Farming in Vidharbha K. JaZees NAVDANYA Steptember 2008, New Delhi 1. Introduction: Vidarbha in Maharashtra consists of the following 11 districts. Sr. No. Districts 1 Yavatmal 2 Amravati 3 Washim 4 Buldhana 10 Gadchiroli 11 Gondia Whereas a large number of farmers in Punjab or Western Uttar Pradesh also have additional sources of livelihood other than agriculture. But farmers in Vidarbha entirely depend on agriculture and that too rainfed agriculture. Some of them have mulching animals but productivity is very low. \"I have no other method of earning a living. I only know to make a living from land\" says Mr. Punjab Rao from Village Jamwadi inYavatmal District. He has 18 acres ofland and grows Cotton, Jowar and Soyabean. 2. BT Cotton in Vidarbha In Maharashtra, almost fifty percent cotton is grown Yavatmal, Wardha, Amravati, Akola, Buldhana, In is largely rainfed. Cotton area in Vidarbha during 2002-03 and 2008-09 is given in Table 1. Because of massive pUblicity and the misleading propaganda by the seed companies, the cultivation of BT Cotton in Maharashtra has gone very rapidly, in last three years. Presently Vidarbha is growing nearly 20% BT Cotton of the country. Table 1 Year Area in Hectares BT Cotton in Vidarbha covers 95-97 percent of cotton area. Though we also keep Non-BT seeds but there is no demand.\" But BT Cotton failed to bring smiles on the faces of the farmers. According to Rajendra Shirbhate of Mangrul Village in Amravati, \"Farmers never had good times but since the introduction of BT Cotton, situation has gone from bad to worse. Low cotton price also played havoc.\" \"Earlier cotton was known as a white gold because we could buy one tola of gold in one quintal of cotton. But now more than 5 quintal of cotton is needed to buy the same amount of gold i.e. one tola of gold.\" recalls a group of elderly farmers in Mangrool village. As shown by Table 2, baring a few, almost all the farmers either incurred the loss or just recovered the cost of cultivation, resulting in debt trap which ultimately leads to suicide. According to Table 2, the average cost of cultivation is Rs. 8164 per acre, while the average Gross income is Rs. 8876 per acre and the net average income is just Rs. 714 per acre. For Farmers of Benora in Washim, the cultivation of BT Cotton has become like 'Matka' (a kind of lottery), in which you never know the outcome. \"During last 5 years the cost of cultivation oif cotton has escalated approximately three times, however the price of cotton has increased just by 20-25%\", says Satish Ingolre of Vithole Village in Washim. According to Ingole, the price of cotton should be above Rs. 3000 per quintal. But there are exceptions too, for instance Arun Sakhaskar of Satephal Village. He has 14 acres of land, out of which on 10 acres he grows BT Cotton. He has two children one son and one daughter with total family size of six. He seems to be happy with BT Cotton. His entire village is growing BT Cotton with inter cropping of tur. Like Arun, Pramod Kale of Bhidi on Wardha is growing BT Cotton on 8 acres of land. Though he is not satisfied with the yield but he does not complain. He has two sons, both of them are in Nagpur, doing Engineering courses. To meet the expenses of his sons, he has also undertaken some job. He says, \"Not to talk of any government Job, even a peon in private company is 100 times better than a farmer, I do not want that my children should live a farmer's life.\" 3. Cultivation of Organic Cotton: Farmers group in the suicide hit Vidarbha argue that the economies of cotton farming have been thrown out of gear. Cotton growing farmers in Vidarbha are living on negative returns. By bringing down cost of cultivation through scientific organic farming and by getting premium on the certified organic produce like cotton, cereals, and pulses, it is possible to come out of the present debt trap. National Commission for Farmers had proposed that the government declare Vidarbha as an organic farming zone. Farmers with bigger lend holding can manage the costs and risks. For small and marginal farmers with rain fed cultivation, it makes economic sense to switch to organic. Navdanya in collaboration with Vidarbha Organic Farmers Association (VOFA) is promoting organic crop across several villages. \"By Organic Cultivation, we do not get much yield of cotton, however we do not have the risk of being indebted and ultimately committing suicides\" says Abhay Thakre of Palasgaon in of Madni in Yavatmal says, \"organic cotton attacks less pests. When there is attack of sucking pest we spray the mixture of cowdung and urine. Besides, organic cotton needs less irrigation, only 2-3 times, where as BT Cotton needs 8-9 times irrigation\". According to Rambhau, a farmer of Zapatkhed, \"There is zero cost of pesticide and Fertilizer\". He got inspiration from Shrikan t, an associate of N avdanya. While the average price for BT Cotton was Rs. 2000/- per quintal, organic cotton fetches much higher price, Rs. 3100 per quintal. According to Table 3 the average cost of cultivating of organic cotton is Rs. 3788, the average gross income per acre is Rs. 10075, and the net income per acre is Rs. 6287 per acre. 4. Cost Benefit Analysis of BT Cotton and Organic Cotton According to Table 2 and Table 3, the Cost Benefit of BT Cotton and Organic Cotton in one acre in Vidarbha is given below: BT Cotton (Rs. / acre) Organic Cotton (Rs. / acre) A. Expenses; seeds; 8164 Net Income (B-A) 714 6287 The above comparison clearly shows that value of input in BT Cotton is more than two times than organic. The income in BT Cotton is just Rs. 714 per acre where as it is Rs. 6287 in organic cotton which is about nine times higher. 5. Costs of Pesticides for BT Cotton: As estimated by Table 2, the average cost of pesticide for BT Cotton is Rs. 1813 per acre or about Rs. 4605 per hectare (1813x2.54) Table 4 gives the approximate value of pesticide spray on cotton in Vidarbha between 2006 and 2008. Table 4 Pesticide costs of BT Cotton in Vidarbha Year Value of Pesticides (Rs. Crores) 2006 633.41 2007 631.89 2008 563.83 In 2007, the area of BT Cotton in Maharashtra and the country was about 2.88 and 6.2 million hectares respectively which shows that Maharashtra on BT Cotton consumed pesticides worth of Rs. 1326 crores, where as for the country the figure comes out to be Rs. 2855 crores. 6. Loss of Conventional Seeds: During last one decade seed companies had evolved comprehensive strategy to promote their seeds by falsifying and dramatizing the yield of their seeds. This was repeatedly enforced by the representatives of the seed companies, farmers seminars and above all seeds dealers, which also acts as moneylenders. Farmers were guaranteed large returns. Even after crop failure in the very first year, for the next year farmers were lured by assuring less spray of pesticides and higher yield. Thus, slowly and systematically farmers were trapped in the vicious circle of BT Cotton. According to Mr. Sudhir of Lingi Village in Yavatmal, \"Earlier entire village used to grow only Desi / Conventional cotton, but today there is hardly any farmer sowing \"Desi Seeds\". Due to continuous neglect all \"Desi Seeds\" of cotton have vanished\". Seed dealers do not store these seeds because nobody buy and moreover there is no profit. \"Why should I sell such seeds when there is no buyer and the profit is minimal\" says Nitin Sarode a seed dealer in Yavatmal. \"Previously Maharashtra Seed Corporation used to sell conventional seeds at the rate of Rs. 50 kg. Then government brought hybrid seed\" says Mr. H.S. Dhinkar of Talni in Yavatmal. The varities seeds were popular. 081 1007 468 and Laxmi The yield of conventional cotton was about 2 quintal per acre. To increase the yield government brought Hybrid seeds of cotton. To promote hybrid cotton, government gave intensive to farmers. The common hybrid varieties were AKH-4 AKH-3 AKH-5 AKH-8 \"The AKH-4 was most common. But Hybrids seeds required a lot of spray to control pests. Then BT Cotton was introduced and these hybrids seeds were replaced by BT Cotton. Thus the government policy destroyed the conventional seeds\" comments Mr. Dhinkar. But surprisingly government officials have no idea, how the conventional seeds were lost and they do not seem to be interested to revive these seeds. 7. Change in Cropping Pattern and Shift to Soyabean in Vidarbha: During 2002 and 2008 Vidarbha has witnessed a significant change in cropping pattern. In Amravati division, the main agricultural area of Vidarbha and consisting of Yavatmal, Buldhana, Washim, Akola and Amravati Districts, the area of 'Jowar the main food crop declined from 504900 hectares in 2002 to 296000 hectares in 2008; a decline of about 42%. Similarly, during the same period the area of 'Moong' also declined from 341300 hectares to 242000 hectares, a decline of 30%. The area of cotton almost remained constant between 2002 and 2007, though it was reduced in 2008 (Table 5). According to Shankar Gulane and Laxman Shelkar ,of Mangrul Village in Amravati now only 10-12% land is used for Jowar, mainly as a fodder for cattle. \"The yield of Jowar is very low, so no one seems to be interested in Jowar' says Purshottam of Singri Village. As shown by Table 5, soyabean has recorded a major shift from just 434100 hectares in 2002 to 1097000 hectares in 2008 i.e. 2.5 times increase in just 6 years. This year alone there was shift of nearly 20%. This shift has come at the expense of Jowar, Moong, cotton and other crops. \"This is because soyabean costs much less to grow than cotton and needs less pesticide and fertilizer than cotton. Besides, it takes less time than cotton. It is sown in May-June and gets ready by November, which means you may grow wheat or other 'Rabi' crop if you have irrigation. This is not the case with cotton\" says Sanjay Garde of Village Girda in Washim. According to K.B. Herde of Injhori, \"Soyabean costs about Rs. 4000 per acre and the yield is 7-8 quintal. The usual market rate for soyabean is Rs. 1500 -1800 per quintal. This gives you safe income of about 8000 per acre which is not the case with BT Cotton\". But this year there was a shortage of soyabean seeds and there was a demand for the subsidized cheaper seed. Some farmer's cites one reason for the shortages of seeds of soyabean. According to these farmers, \"dealers backing cotton in a region where BT Cotton now reigns supreme feared that the ongoing shift to Soyabean would rob them of their huge profit which they earn by selling BT Cotton seeds and pesticides. There is no benefit for them in the shift to soyabean. Hence these dealers created the shortage of soyabean seeds\". Unfortunately an unprecedented pest attack caused irreparable damage to standing crops of soyabean in Vidarbha affecting over millions of farmers. It had been identified as leaf eating caterpillar known in local parlence as military worm or \"Lashkari Kira\". 8. False Propaganda by BT Seed Companies To promote the sale of their seeds, companies resort to false and misleading propaganda. For instance, Chintamani a seed dealer in Kalamb displace two advertisements of Ankur BT. Both these advertisements exaggerates the yield of Ankur BT. Personal discussion with Ramesh Bhau Mahtre, the person whose name was given in the advertisement reveals that he has the demonstration plot for Ankur and the yield is lower than the claim in the advertisement (See Box). 1.

Common Pests and Pesticide BT Cotton is mainly attacted by following pest Jassids Aphids Thrips Boll Worm Mealy Bug Military worm Following Pesticides are used to control above Confidore Acetamiprid Monochrotophos Farmers Suicides in Vidarbha According to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) more than 1.5 lakh farmers committed suicide during 1997-2005. Maharashtra alone accounts for nearly 30,000 suicides, largely concentrated in Vidarbha region. As many as 1211 distressed farmers committed suicide in 2007 in Vidarbha, the cotton belt of Maharashtra. Among the 11 districts in Vidharbha region, Yavatmal accounted for maximum suicides at (332) followed by Amravati (210). Other districts to cross the 100 marks were Washim (162), Buldhana (142), Akola (114) and Wardha (110). Most of the suicides occurred in the main districts growing BT Cotton. The remaining five districts which were not included in the Prime Minister's package recorded lower number of deaths. Nagpur registered (42), Bhandara (32), Chandrapur (35), Gadchiroli (18) and Gondia (14). Table 6 Sr. No. Districts Suicides 1 Yavatmal 332 2 Amravati 210 3 Washim 162 4 Buldhana 142 5 Akola 114 6 Wardha 110 7 Nagpur 42 8 Bhandara 32 9 Chandrapur 35 10 Gadchiroli 18 11 Gondia 14 Total 2011 Finance Minister is his budget proposal 2008-2009 had announced a loan waiver of Rs. 60,000 crores which was subsequently increased to Rs. 71,000 crores. However, the farmers in Vidarbha failed to gain as the average land holding here is above the stipulated limit of 2 hectares. In districts like Yavatmal, which had recorded highest number of farmers suicides, almost 54 percent of farmers are not eligible for waiver. Besides, the package money did not reach the local banks till mid of September. To distribute the loan during \"KhariF seasons co-operative banks and local banks had to borrow from NABARD and other sources. It is therefore, should not come as a surprise that even after the announcement of debt waiver farmers suicides continues unabated. Since then, a large number of farmers have committed suicide. Some of them are listed below. Name Village cotton failure and indebtedness, Vidarbha faces a new problem and this is a disturbing trend. Farmers are finding it difficult to get their children married off. Rambhau of Zapetkhed who has three daughters comments, \"In a suicide ridden Vidarbha, girls avoid marriage with poor farmers for fear that they may commit suicide. They also do not want their fathers to take more loans\". His views are shared by Shankar of Ko1ambi in Yavatmal. Incidentally Shankar has three sisters-in-law (sisters of wife). 12. Main Conclusions: 1. BT Cotton has replaced more than 95% conventional and hybrid cotton. 2. Average cost of BT Cotton cultivation is about Rs. 8164/-per acre and the profit is only Rs. 714 per acre. 3. The average cost of organic cotton cultivation is Rs. 3788/-per acre and the net profit is Rs. 6287 per acre. 4. In case of the organic cotton the cost of pesticides and fertilizer is cipher. For BT Cotton these two inputs costs about Rs. 3400 per acre. 5. Nearly 91% farmers growing BT Cotton are indebted whereas only 4% farmers cultivating organic cotton are indebted. 6. Due to government policies all the 'Desi/Conventiona1 seeds are lost, and now no traders keep them'. 7. During last 7 years, Vidarbha has witnessed significant change in cropping pattern. In Amravati division, the main agricultural area of Vidarbha, the area of Jowar, the main food crop has declined from 504900 hectares in 2002 and 296000 in 2008. (a 42% decline). Similarly during the same period, the area of 'Moong' declined from 341300 hectares to 24200 hectares (a decline of 30%). The area of cotton remained constant between 2002-07. However, in 2008 it also registered a decline over previous year from 1150400 hectares to 1019500 hectare a 20% decline). But soyabean recorded a spectacular growth from just 434100 hectares to 1097000 hectares during 2002 and 2008. It recorded nearly 20% increase over last year. 8. During last five years the cost of cultivation increased almost three times (300% increase) but the price of cotton did not increase proportionately. The price of cotton increased only23% from Rs. 1700/-to Rs. 2100/ -per quintal 9. To control the larger segment of the BT Cotton seed market, companies have flooded the Vidarbha. The major companies have several brands, of BT seeds. Though there are more than 30 companies, however, Nuziveedu, Ankur and Rasi are commonly used by farmers. Surprisingly Mahyacol BT seeds are not preferred by the farmers, as it failed to give better results. 10. The relief package announced by the Finance Minister did not benefit the farmers as till mid of September, the package failed to reach local banks. To distribute. the loan during (Khari/, season, cooperative banks and local banks had to borrow from NABARD and other sources.

How the American public are starting to turn against GM food \u00a9 Soil Association Land of the GM-Free? Executive summary Despite the fact that 87 per cent of Americans believe that their food should carry a label telling them whether Genetically Modified (GM) products have been used in it or not, almost none do. As a result GM food has been sold widely and for many years in the USA -without consumers being aware of what they are buying. The powerful pro-GM lobby in the USA has used this as evidence that the public accept, or are at least neutral, on the issue of GM food. But given a choice, over 50 per cent of Americans say they would not eat GM. The GM industry has managed to keep US consumers in the dark about the food they are eating for more than a decade, through lobbying the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and state governments to ensure that foods do not legally have to be labelled as GM. But some major new developments in the US market suggest that the tide may finally be turning against the GM lobby. This briefing is not intended to be comprehensive, but it highlights some significant developments that are being ignored in the current UK debate about GM. In 1994 Monsanto produced a genetically engineered bovine growth hormone (rBGH) that is injected into dairy cows to increase the yield of milk. This G M hormone has faced criticism internationally since its launch on the grounds of both human health risks and animal welfare concerns. While the EU and Canada rejected it, it was deemed safe by the US Food and Drug Administration and the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and has been used widely in the US dairy industry, without any labelling of the milk as 'GM-produced'. Monsanto worked very hard to ensure that consumers have no way to make a choice -getting some US states to ban dairies from selling their milk with 'no artificial growth hormone' labels. But increasing consumer awareness of rBGH in the US has caused sales of the milk to plummet. Between 2002 and 2007 use of the hormone fell by 23% and the proportion of US cows being injected with rBGH fell from 25% to below 17%. Understanding their customers wishes, many major retailers, processors and producers have recently moved to ban rBGH from their products, with Walmart, Safeway, Starbucks, Kraft and many more ensuring that their customers can buy GMO free dairy products for themselves and their families. Opposition to the use of this hormone has grown so much that Monsanto announced last month that they would be selling off the failing product. As well as this growing consumer rejection of GM food in America, GM companies have had to face opposition by US farmers and regulatory authorities to a series of new GM products. Both GM rice and GM wheat faced such strong opposition from farmers that they never made it out of field trials, and have never been grown commercially in the USA. Hardly any GM sweet corn' for human consumption is grown either (as opposed to maize grown for animal feed), for the simple reason that it tastes so bad that consumers won't buy it. Attempts to launch GM alfalfa, America's fourth most widely grown crop, have also fallen flat. Farmers took legal action against the release of the crop and won. In 2007 the USDA was ordered to withdraw its approval of the GM alfalfa, a ban was placed on all planting of the crop and the sale of GM alfalfa seeds has now been prohibited throughout the USA. There is also evidence that US plant breeders are rejecting GM technology in favour of more reliable and effective methods such as marker assisted selection. Despite soya being one of the most widely grown GM crops, the newest high-yielding soya strains are non-GM. For the first time in the USA, a major labelling initiative is underway that will finally provide consumers with the option of choosing a wide range of non-GM foods. The biggest companies in the natural and organic industry have united to develop a non-GMO label scheme that offers consumers the choice they clearly wish for, backed up by a robust verification system to ensure that it is a claim they can trust. This new 'Non-GMO Project' will be launched next year. It is led by a group of companies with combined annual sales of at least $12 billion -equivalent to almost 10% of the entire UK food and drink industry. Around four hundred companies across the US and Canada have pledged their support, and at the outset around 28,000 different products are likely to be covered by the scheme. With US consumers, farmers and politicians losing their enthusiasm for GM crops, it is not surprising that the GM industry has scaled up its efforts to find a new market in the EU. But in Europe, over 175 regions and over 4,500 municipalities and local areas have declared themselves GMO-free. Major countries that once supported GM, like France and Germany, no longer do so, and the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are all committed to GM-free policies. It is just the strongly pro-GM English Government that looks increasingly out of touch with what consumers really want. 1 This report uses English terminology for crop names. We use 'maize' not 'corn' (for the crop used as animal feed), and 'sweet corn' for the maize people eat. 'Oilseed rape' is used instead of the North American 'canola'. Note that 'alfalfa' is also called 'lucerne' in the UK. Monsanto's GM bovine growth hormone What is it and what does it do? In 1994 Monsanto released a new GM product onto the market: recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH), trade name Posilac (also known as rBST). It is an artificial, genetically modified version of bovine somatotropin, a hormone produced in the pituitary gland of cattle that stimulates growth in young cattle and lactation in adult cows. When the GM protein is injected into dairy cows (they have to be repeatedly injected every two weeks), it has the effect of increasing milk production by 7-15%. Health The use of rBGH has been controversial primarily due to its negative effects on animal health and concern has also been expressed by scientists over its potential effects on human health. Meta-analyses of the scientific evidence published by the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association and the EU Scientific Committee for Animal Health and Animal Welfare have concluded that the use of rBGH causes 'substantially and very significantly poorer welfare in cows'. Their findings indicated that cattle receiving rBGH injections suffer from: 50% increased incidence of lameness 25% increased incidence of mastitis, a painful infection of the udder 18% increased incidence of infertility, an indicator of overall poor health infection at the site of injection, with lesions exacerbated by repeat injections substantial increase in multiple births which can lead to welfare problems As well as these serious negative impacts on the welfare of cows, there are risks to human and animal health: the routine use of antibiotics to combat the elevated levels of disease in cows contributes to the development of resistant disease strains and thus reducing the available drugs for both human and animal use veterinary drugs found in milk elevated levels of pus in the milk from infected udders Scientists have raised the possibility of several other human health risks resulting from consumption of milk produced with rBGH. While there does not appear to be a higher level of bovine growth hormone in milk from treated cows, levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are significantly elevated to at least 5 times the PDA~t:;u~ No~'dll!i.;.\"\", In.mi1kfrom~ o-..! wi'\" urm.l &,\"'IN~J}(t:!'I.\\W-tI.~; normal level. This substance is identical in both cattle and humans, and increased levels of IGF-1 in humans have been linked to cancer of the prostate, breast and colon. Indeed, an inquiry by the UK Veterinary Products Committee in 1999 stated that the likely increase of IFG-1 in the gut lumen following consumption of rBGH treated milk raised concerns about enhanced cell proliferation of the gut mucosa and therefore increased risk of cancer of the colon. Regulation The drug was approved for full distribution in the United States in 1993 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on the basis of one 90 day study on 30 rats that had been carried out by Monsanto. Regulators in the EU and Canada were not convinced. Health Canada (the Canadian equivalent of the US FDA) stated that the results of Monsanto's rat trial showed cause for concern, and, following a detailed safety review, made the decision to ban the use of rBGH on the basis of unacceptable risks to animal health. EU regulators also refused approval for the drug, and launched an in-depth scientific study on the risks of using artificial hormones in farm animals. Their research led to a ban on rBGH use in the EU in 1989, made permanent in 2000, and the additional decision to ban imports of hormone-treated beef, which effectively blocked the majority of imports of beef from North America. In 1996 the USA complained to the World Trade Organisation, which eventually ruled in its favour, stating that the EU had not provided enough significant proof of danger. In contrast to its position on GM crops, the EU stated that it was the product's safety that should be conclusively proven, not its risks. The EU stood firm on its health concerns, and rather than allow synthetic hormones into the European food supply, it endured US trade sanctions amounting to 116.8 million USD per year on such items as Roquefort cheese and Dijon mustard. These sanctions are still in effect today. Currently, rBGH is not approved for use in Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Canada or the European Union. Use in US -widespread and unlabelled but not without controversy Despite the international controversy, Monsanto's GM hormone was launched in 1994 in the US, and by 2002, around a quarter of cows in the country were being treated with rBGH. The FDA stated that since the recombinant, or genetically engineered form of BGH looks virtually identical to a cow's natural somatotropin, there is no significant difference between milk from treated and untreated cows. The FDA also concluded that it did not have the authority to require special labelling for milk and dairy products from rBGH-treated cows. While permitting dairies to label milk as 'from cows not treated with rBGH/artificial growth hormone', they stated that producers have no basis for claiming that milk from cows not treated with rBGH is safer than milk from rBGH-treated cows. Despite these assurances, the American public were not as easily pacified as Monsanto might have hoped. Consumer groups were active in raising awareness of the risks of rBGH and while hormone-treated dairy products had become the norm in supermarkets and the food service sector, increasing numbers of smaller dairies chose to advertise their non-use of rBGH to their customers. Monsanto went on the offensive and sued a number of these dairies, alleging that they were illegally suggesting that non-rBGH milk was superior. In several cases, dairies were forced to add text to their labels echoing the FDA's statement of rBGH's safety. This didn't fool the American public. The campaign against rBGH continued, scientists and doctors spoke out in the media about their concerns, and at their annual conference in June 2008 the American Nurses Association voted to work to \"eliminate the use of rBGH in the US by appealing to those who make purchasing decisions within the institutions where we work\". Since Monsanto introduced rBGH to the dairy industry in 1994, demand for milk produced without synthetic hormones has increased by 500%. Many consumers switched to organic milk as, in the absence of reliable information, it was the only label they trust enough to give to their children. Between 2002 and 2007 use of the hormone fell by 23% and the proportion of US cows being injected with rBGH fell below 17%. Desperate measures Last year, Monsanto appealed to the FDA to block all labelling that refers to production without rBGH, and to the Federal Trade Commission to block any advertising of milk that mentioned non-use of the synthetic hormone. Both bodies dismissed Monsanto's complaint, stating that they would only intervene where fraudulent claims were made. Since Monsanto failed to get federal support to impose a blanket ban on references to rBGH-free production, it started to campaign to restrict labelling information on a state-by-state basis. With the backing of a few of the most intensive dairy farming companies, Monsanto have been exerting pressure on state governments but have faced strong opposition from consumer groups and farmers. In both Ohio and Utah laws are being considered that would ban 'rBGH-free' labels as 'misleading' on the basis that this couldn't be verified by a simple compositional test of the milk. Utah are proposing to ban all statements about production methods, while in Ohio any mention of rBGH on a label would have to be accompanied by the statement \"FDA says no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST-supplemented and non-rBST supplemented cows\" in a specified font, size and package location. Both the International Dairy Foods Association and the Organic Trade Association are currently pursuing legal challenges against this. Another attempt to limit consumer information was made in Pennsylvania last year. The Secretary of Agriculture proposed a law in October 2007 that banned non-rBGH labelling. Following an outcry by consumers and the dairy industry, this was overturned by the Governor in January 2008. Monsanto have tried to push similar labelling restrictions through in Indiana, Missouri, Kansas, Vermont and New Jersey, but in each case the ban has so far failed to make it through the state legislature. A further last ditch move to save the drug's image was the attempt to rebrand rBGH as environmentally friendly. Jumping on the green bandwagon, the company saw an opportunity to trivialise the drug's welfare issues by presenting them as a necessary sacrifice to be made in a time of climate change crisis, where global food shortages and carbon emissions could only be solved by the production efficiencies rBGH provided. A study led by a former Monsanto-employed consultant and co-authored by the company's rBGH technical project manager proposed that rBGH use provides a way to reduce greenhouse gases, as the same quantity of milk can be produced by fewer cows. But as the journal Scientific American pointed out, the study hinged on the assumption that the cows injected with the GM hormone produced more milk for a given amount of feed - a claim specifically disallowed by the FDA when the drug was approved in 1993. In fact an rBGH herd would be consuming the same amount of feed -land, oil-based fertiliser and fuel for intensive cereal production -as a slightly larger non-rBGH herd producing the same amount of milk. The rBGH cows would need more veterinary drugs and produce lower quality milk. Both the US National Academy of Sciences and the US Environmental Protection agency have dismissed claims that rBGH could have any environment benefits. Market defeat 2007 represented a turning point in consumer rejection of Monsanto's GM hormone. Demand for clean milk reached a critical mass, and major American brands paid attention. Knowing the importance of meeting their customers' demands, the country's biggest supermarket chains rushed to ban rBGH from their milk. By 2008 Costco, Kroger, Publix, Safeway and, most significantly, Wal-Mart have all removed rBGH from their own-brand milk. This has had a major impact all the way down the supply chain, ultimately pushing the nation's biggest dairy, Deans Foods, and their near-exclusive supplier Dairy Farmers of America, to phase out use of the drug. Starbucks announced in January 2008 that they had gone entirely rBGH-free, as did Chipotle, a national restaurant chain. Manufacturing giant Kraft is now producing an rBGH-free version of its cheese products. At the end of July this year, in what has been hailed as a major victory for consumers, Monsanto announced that it would be selling off the failing product. First major GM labelling initiative in USA: the Non-GMO Project In a recent poll, 53% of Americans said that they would not eat GM foods. This shows a significant disparity between what consumers in the US want from their food system and what that food system is actually delivering. It also demonstrates a lack of consumer knowledge about the proportion of food in America that contains GM. The majority of this 53% will already be unwittingly consuming GM food every day against their wishes, because GM food is currently not labelled in the US, despite the fact that 87% of Americans believe that it should be. The US Government's opposition to telling American consumers that some of their food is GM stems from the greatest coup by the GM companies, which was to ensure no GM food had to be tested for safety. The concept of \"substantial equivalence\" means that if a GM crop looks like its non-GM equivalent and grows like it, then it is assumed to be the same, and no safety testing is needed before people eat it. GM maize may have added virus and antibiotic resistance genes, and a gene that makes it express an insecticide in every leaf, stem and root -but to the US government it looks and grows like maize, so it is safe to eat. \"/ think that consumer rejection of GMOs is growing, and that giving the public here a choice will be a significant catalyst for continuing that trend\" Megan Thompson, Executive Director, the Non-GMO Project This has meant that GM foods don't have to be labelled, and has resulted in widespread ignorance among consumers about the presence of GM in their food. Keeping consumers in the dark has prevented them from making real choices about the food they eat. Without labels the principles of supply and demand are no longer in effect as consumers can't send a message to farmers and manufacturers about what they do, and don't, want to eat. Barriers to non-GM status for companies Even though general consumer knowledge of GMOs is low in the US, there are still consumers who are well-informed and want to feed themselves and their families non-GM foods. North America has a thriving natural products industry and many organic and natural food companies. These companies have made a number of attempts to maintain non-GM status, however: companies can only control their own operating systems, with limited influence over others in the supply chain working in isolation companies do not have the market clout to secure clean supplies of ingredients, in some cases having to discontinue some product lines as they could no longer secure guaranteed non-GM ingredients it is costly to devise and regulate a GMO traceability system, maintain a testing regime, market non-GM status, and educate and inform consumers the lack of one recognised label that guarantees non-GM status led to distrust of non-GM claims among consumers, exacerbated by a number of high profile incidents in which foods labelled GM-free were found to contain GMOs after all. This has been a particular threat to organic businesses. In the US, the Government's organic standards say that certified foods should not be produced with GM ingredients, but a certain level of 'unavoidable' GM contamination is tolerated. This is seen by some as the thin end of the wedge, and as the GM crop acreage rises, organic companies have decided to take action to safeguard the future against the possibility of losing non-GM supplies of corn and soy in the next few years. The Non-GMO Project In 2005, two natural food retailers started the 'Non-GMO Project \" to develop a robust, industry-wide non-GMO verification system that would provide consumers with a trustworthy and recognisable non-GMO label to look for on products. The project would provide efficiencies of scale and would enable certification to be done in a simple low-cost way. The companies' united front could send a message to suppliers about non-GMO demand. They ensured the project would have robust scientific backing, and by 2007 the project expanded its board of directors to include representatives from all stakeholder groups in the natural products industry. \"By giving people here an informed choice, the Non-GMO Project is going to help align the food production in North America with what people here really want.\" Megan Thompson, Executive Director, the Non-GMO Project The project is now supported by the biggest companies in the North American natural and organic sector, an industry worth over $62 billion in the US alone. Well-known brands such as Whole Foods, Seeds of Change and Nature's Way are supporting the campaign, along with around 400 companies across the US and Canada, representing annual sales of around $12billion. The Non-GMO verification scheme has just opened (summer 2008) for product registration. Already several hundred products have been enrolled and it is anticipated that several thousand will be registered in the coming months. The project has also set up an ingredient supplier database to help manufacturers find uncontaminated ingredients through access to a list of verified non-GM suppliers. As increasing numbers of processors and distributors get their products verified, the database of trusted sources is growing. The Non-GMO seal will be launched on labels in October 2009 in conjunction with a major consumer awareness campaign. Several things indicate that the US market is ready for this sort of initiative. Greater interest in healthy food among consumers is reflected by the steady growth in sales of natural and organic food. In 2007, the US natural products industry was worth $62 billion and growing at 10%, while the organic sector was worth $20 billion and growing at 21%. With the uproar over rBGH dairy products finally making GM a prominent consumer issue, American consumers are beginning to ask more questions about where their food comes from. The project is anticipating registration of around 28,000 unique products from the organic and natural industry in the verification scheme over the next few years, representing 70% of the sector. By implementing the non-GMO standard, the project aims to keep new GM crops from gaining dominance and build a resilient non-GM food sector within the United States. Good Earth Natural Foods COMPANY \u00b7rI 'AlhfteWave Above: the founding leaders of the Non-GMO Project \"The industry is fairly integrated as far as production facilities and ingredient supplies, and by gaining agreement about what \"non-GMO\" means we finally have the opportunity to really change things and take a united stand against unwanted GM contamination. \" Megan Thompson, Executive Director, the Non-GMO Project ~ EDEN~ Rejection of new GM crops by farmers, regulators and plant breeders On top of the growing consumer rejection of existing GM food in America, GM companies have faced rejection of a series of new products by US farmers and regulatory authorities. GM wheat, rice and alfalfa have all failed to get off the ground, as has GM sweet corn, which consumers simply refused to eat because it tastes so bad. In fact, after the first handful of GM crops were introduced in America in the late 1990s, US farmers and consumers have stopped any more commercialisation of GM crops. This suggests that the claim from the pro-GM lobby that GM crops have been welcomed by US farmers deserves scrutiny. The US regulatory approval process is also increasingly questioned. Proposed field trials of several new GM crops, such as drug-producing maize and sugar cane and herbicide tolerant bentgrass, have been subject to federal court cases. In each case the court ruled that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) had broken the law in granting the trials approval without adequate safety data. In 2007 a federal district judge ruled that the USDA must halt approval of all new GM field trials until more rigorous environmental reviews are conducted. GM Wheat Following the widespread introduction of Monsanto's Roundup Ready GM maize, soybeans and oilseed rape (all engineered to be resistant to the weed-killer Roundup, which usually kills all plants), the company soon produced a Roundup Ready GM wheat variety. Monsanto expected their new wheat to get the same easy ride that greeted the first GM crops. However, several years experience of the first GM crops resulted in enormous opposition to GM wheat from the food and farming industries. American farmers had learned the hard way that their export markets did not want GM food, and the benefits for farmers that GM companies claim were obviously not enough to make the risk worth running. As GM varieties of maize, soybeans and oilseed rape gained in dominance, initially through deliberate plantings but accelerated by cross-contamination, US farmers had watched helplessly as huge international customers from Europe, Japan and other countries rejected their grain in preference to non-GM crops. Studies predicted that GM wheat would fare no better. An economic report by Iowa State University produced in 2003, and updated in 2005, estimated that the commercial introduction of a GM variety of wheat could result in the loss of one third to one half of the US export market and that the price of spring wheat would plunge by a third. In part there was heightened opposition to GM wheat both within the US and internationally because, while existing GM crops are primarily grown for animal feed, wheat is used both for animal feed and for human food. The idea of GM daily bread was a step too far for consumers. The mainstream farming industry in the US lobbied against this new GM crop, saying that the introduction of GM wheat would be a serious threat to the economy, and the Canadian Wheat Board produced a damning report showing that, based on their country's experience of herbicide tolerant GM crops thus far, Monsanto's GM wheat should also be banned on environmental grounds. In the face of such categorical rejection, Monsanto abandoned its field trials of Roundup-Ready wheat in 2004, stating that it was more profitable for the company to concentrate its efforts on soya, maize and oilseed rape. GM Alfalfa Alfalfa, a grass used for animal feed, is the fourth most widely grown crop in the USA, behind corn, soybeans and wheat, and it is the third most economically valuable. More than 20 million acres of alfalfa are grown in the United States and it is the most important forage crop, providing feed for the nations beef and dairy cattle in particular. In 2005, a GM strain of alfalfa was approved by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). It had been developed by Monsanto in partnership with America's largest alfalfa seed company, Forage Genetics International. This alfalfa was engineered to withstand Monsanto's trademark glyphosate herbicide 'Roundup'. However, despite regulatory approval, a large number of American farmers also rejected the introduction of this new GM crop. Alfalfa is an open-pollinated crop and pollen grains can travel long distances in the wind or via pollinating insects. This poses a serious contamination risk for conventional and organic growers, and cross-pollination could quickly reduce and even wipe out the US supply of non-GM alfalfa. Not only are those growing non-GM alfalfa unprotected from the economic damage that GM contamination causes, but they are also vulnerable to harassment and lawsuits from Monsanto if GM alfalfa is found on their land. Monsanto sues farmers with GM crops growing on their farms for patent violation, even if they have. never actually planted any GM seeds themselves. In addition, many farmers currently produce normal alfalfa with minimal, if any, use of weed-killers. The introduction of a GM herbicide tolerant variety would not only encourage the use of far greater quantities of glyphosate, but also speed the growing development of glyphosate resistance in weeds, meaning that ever more toxic herbicides would need to be applied to all alfalfa crops to control them. In February 2006, a coalition of alfalfa producers filed a lawsuit against the USDA claiming that GM alfalfa was a threat to both the environment and to farmers' livelihoods. The case was heard a year later, and in a landmark decision, the court ruled in their favour, declaring that the USDA had violated the law and had been \"cavalier\" in deciding that a full environmental impact statement was not necessary. The judge stated that \"A federal action that eliminates a farmer's choice to grow non-genetically engineered crops, or a consumer's choice to eat non-genetically engineered food, is an undesirable consequence\". The USDA was ordered to withdraw its approval of the GM alfalfa, a ban was placed on all planting of the crop and the sale of GM alfalfa seeds has now been prohibited throughout the USA. Despite an appeal by Monsanto, their GM alfalfa remains illegal until they can prove through a full environmental review that farmers and consumers will be protected, and non-GM crops will not be affected by their product. GM Rice Despite the development and USDA approval of several strains of GM rice, not one type is grown commercially in the United States. The US rice industry has consistently opposed the growing of GM rice, aware that there is no market for it. A number of key events have ensured that they are in no hurry to change their minds. In the last two years, catastrophic GM contamination incidents have put the entire US long-grain rice industry in crisis and cost the sector over $1 billion. In 2006 it was discovered that Bayer CropScience, a giant biotechnology firm, had accidentally contaminated over 30% of the entire US long-grain rice supply with three of their GM varieties, two of which had not been approved for cultivation or consumption anywhere in the world. None of the contaminant strains had ever been grown commercially, and the only possible source of contamination was traced to field trials carried out years earlier, between 1998 and 2002. It has not been established whether the contamination occurred through cross-pollination or through a post-harvest mix-up, but there should have been no route to the food supply for these experimental crops. The incident had powerful global consequences. The EU, Japan, Korea and the Philippines imposed strict testing requirements and effectively shut down rice trade with the US, halting shipments, cancelling orders and recalling rice from supermarket shelves. Several other countries imposed bans on US rice or demanded non-GM certification before purchase, and soon the major rice-importing countries had switched to suppliers such as Thailand or Vietnam, who quickly pledged to remain GM-free. Furious US rice farmers and traders filed multi-million dollar class action lawsuits against Bayer CropScience, but even compensation for their harvests will not undo the serious and continuing damage to the US rice industry. A second serious contamination incident occurred just one year later, in early 2007. It was announced that 'Clearfield 131', one of the most popular non-GM long-grain rice seeds had become contaminated with an unapproved GM strain, again from Bayer CropScience. Sale of the seed was quickly banned by the USDA, and some farmers were forced to destroy crops already sown. Combined with the ban on rice seed that had been contaminated in the Bayer incident of 2006, this new discovery had the effect of seriously cutting the amount of available rice seed for farmers to plant, and led to reduced harvests with some farmers abandoning rice growing altogether. BASF, who produce Clearfield 131 lost up to $9 million dollars in the incident. Bayer's clear inability to control contamination has led to rice producers calling for a ban on all experimental outdoor plantings of GM rice, and it seems that the commercialisation of any GM rice varieties is unlikely to happen in America in the foreseeable future. Highest yielding soya strains are non-GM With pressure to develop higher yielding varieties of food crops, US plant breeders are rejecting GM technology in favour of more reliable and effective methods. Soya farmers have been frustrated for years by the slow pace of increases in soya yields. This has been due in part to the dominance of Monsanto's Roundup Ready soya over the last decade. This GM soya has been shown to yield less than non-GM varieties. However, Pioneer, a branch of biotech giant DuPont, have finally had some success. Ignoring unreliable GM techniques that disrupt the plant's biology, Pioneer have instead used marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding. MAS uses knowledge of the genome to speed up the selection process, but uses conventional cross-breeding that allows the plant to maintain its own safe-guards on gene expression. MAS is a technique long supported by environmentalists and organic farmers. Results of crop trials demonstrate a 5-10% yield advantage for this MAS soya over competitive varieties. This approach echoes the latest rice breeding research taking place in South East Asia, as scientists pursuing the ideal of flood and drought resistant varieties have left GM techniques behind and are concentrating on the more successful application of MAS methods to meet these goals. Conclusion Since the introduction of GM food, probably the biggest selling GM food product bought by consumers in the US has been GM hormone-treated milk. Dairy products produced with Monsanto's GM growth hormone achieved huge market penetration following their launch in 1994, but are now on their way out due to consumer resistance. This resistance to GM-produced milk started when consumers began to see non-GM labelled milk in their shops. Labelling milk as 'GM hormone free' has been the only significant move to label any food as 'non-GM' until now. Just open for product registration, the Non-GMO Project is a major new market-led initiative in North America that will provide the sort of labelling that killed GM food in the EU, Japan and other countries. Every attempt to pass laws on GM labelling in the US has been fought fiercely by Monsanto and other GM companies, but there is now strong support from companies with combined sales of $12 billion to give consumers accurate information about GM in their food. Even though US consumers are turning against GM, the GM industry has always claimed that US farmers love GM crops. But in fact farmers rejected genetically modified wheat, one of the largest commodity crops in the world, and no GM wheat is grown in North America. Farmers have also rejected GM alfalfa, the fourth most widely grown crop in the US. Following a court victory for farmers, the USDA was ordered to withdraw its approval of the GM alfalfa, a ban was placed on all planting of the crop and the sale of GM alfalfa seeds has now been prohibited throughout the USA. Despite the development of many commercial strains of GM rice, no GM rice is being grown commercially in the US, and even in the case of soya, one of the most widely grown GM crops, the newest high-yielding varieties being developed are non-GM rather than GM. These developments, combined with the possibility of Democrat Presidential Candidate Barack Obama's pledge to support legislation to label GM food if he should get elected, suggest that GM companies are in for a difficult few years in the USA. The increasing focus on the climate change impacts of farming, to which GM crops offer no solution, and expensive oil driving up the cost of nitrogen fertiliser, on which GM crops are dependent, also suggest the environmental and economic pressures on GM will increase. With consumers, farmers and politicians in America losing their enthusiasm for GM crops, it is not surprising that the GM industry has scaled up its efforts to find a new market in the EU. Major European farming countries, like the previously enthusiastically pro-GM French and German governments have gone cold. Other EU countries, like Greece, have always resolutely opposed GM crops, and among the newer EU member states, many, such as Poland, have already adopted non-GM policies. Over 175 regions and over 4,500 municipalities and local areas in Europe have declared themselves GMO-free. The Irish Republic, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are all committed to GM-free policies. This has left just the present English government ministers on an increasingly lonely and desperate pro-GM quest, as consumers in their main pro-GM ally, the United States, increasingly reject this uncertain, risky and unproductive technology.

When taro leaf blight (TLB) hit the country in 1993, taro exports were worth $T20 million annually. TLB wiped out the entire taro industry in a matter of months, it raised food security concerns and export revenues nose-dived thus upsetting the nation's comfortable level of foreign reserves. Across the food sector, taro was soon replaced by less nutritious starchy staples in the form of instant noodles and rice. Samoa's taro industry is now slowly getting back on its feet after the devastating outbreak of TLB caused by the fungus Phytophtora colocasiae. New taro cultivars recently released have been assessed for their production qualities and closely studied in trial plots in various locations around the country. This approach has allowed farmers to have direct input to the assessment of the cultivars, which passed the acid test for taro production in Samoa post-TLB. Their assessments -good tasting, high yielding and, most importantly they're TLB-tolerant. \"They are very similar to the kind of taro we used to have where taste was the top priority,\" the CEO for the Ministry of Agriculture Asuao Kirifi Pouono said. \"These new varieties all have the taste we Samoans prefer,\" he reminisced about the so-called highly favoured taro Niue. This was the main variety grown before 1993 but was highly susceptible to TLB. \"We call it mapo or firm to bite. They are also red, similar to the taro grown throughout Samoa pre-TLB.\" In October, three new taro cultivars were launched by the Minister of Agriculture Taua Kitiona. One of the varieties named Taua after him. The other two, taro So'o and taro Tonu, are named after researchers who worked on the breeding programme at Nuu Crop Development. Asuao said more than 20 new varieties have so far been released to farmers since the breeding programme started. The main push now is to bulk up these new cultivars to provide adequate planting material for farmers. In response to the TLB outbreak in Samoa, and in recognition of the continuing loss of taro genetic diversity throughout the Pacific, the Australian government, through AusAID, funded a regional project entitled Taro Genetic Resources: Conservation and Utilisation (TaroGen). One component of the project focused on breeding and was based at the Alafua Campus of the University of the South Pacific (USP). The Taro Improvement Programme was designed to work 1/2 Taro industry getting back on its feet Saturday, 06 December 2008 15:26 with national programmes run by MAFF and with farmers around the country to develop a national strategy for taro improvement. The first stage of the project evaluated taro diversity in regional collections and in other cultivars sent to Samoa in response to a request for help. Initially, new TLB-tolerant varieties from the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and the Philippines were introduced, both to maintain taro production and to assess their susceptibility to TLB in Samoa. Taro Fili (from the Philippines) became the first TLB-tolerant variety that local consumers liked. When boiled, it had the right firmness and taste but developed too hard a texture when baked in the umu (Samoan earth oven). A variety from Palau with good tolerance to TLB, good taste and reddish in colour was also well received. Polo voli, (so called because of its volley ball shape) became a winner with farmers and consumers. The Taro Improvement Programme put a participatory breeding project in place to work with farmers to screen and select new clones, initially from the Pacific. The active participation of taro growers has been the key to the success of the programme, which has continued work on breeding and selecting superior taro varieties since the TaroGen project concluded. Funding and technical assistance is being maintained with support from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and USP. The recent release of the new cultivars shows the importance of agencies working together to tackle a problem. It also highlights the benefits of a participatory approach to variety selection and breeding. The need to take into account different growing conditions within a country, and changes in these conditions, becomes even more important with the increasing impact of climate change. The programme has recently developed crosses (lines) between taro from the Pacific and from Asia, which are receiving excellent feedback from farmers in Samoa. Donors are often concerned about the sustainability of a project once their funding support has ceased. The fact that the Taro Improvement Programme is still active and is supported nationally and regionally is convincing evidence of the project's sustainability .

Recent examples are the southern com leaf blight and coffee rust epidemics of the 1970s. In the Pacific region the impact of taro leaf blight, caused by the fungus Phytophthora colocasiae, and the threat it poses to countries not yet affected by the disease, illustrate this point clearly. The spread of the fungus to Samoa in 1993 demonstrated once again the devastating potential of the disease when, over a period of six months, the country lost an export industry worth US$10 million per year with a similar value for domestic supplies. Events of similar catastrophe occurred in Solomon Islands 50 years earlier and caused a loss of varieties and major changes to the cropping systems. Taro leaf blight and the causal pathogen P. colocasiae To date, taro leaf blight has been recorded in a number of countries in the Pacific region, most recently in Samoa in 1993. The disease is mainly a foliar pathogen although postharvest storage rots also occur. Initial symptoms of the disease are small brown water-soaked flecks on the leaf that enlarge to form dark brown lesions, often with a yellow margin. Secondary infections lead to rapid destruction of the leaf, which may occur in 10-20 days or less in very susceptible varieties. The normal longevity of a healthy leaf is about 40 days. The disease significantly reduces the number of functional leaves and can lead to yield reductions of the magnitude of 50% (Trujillo and Aragaki, 1964; Trujillo, 1967; Jackson, 1999). Inoculum in the form of spores is spread by wind-driven rain and dew to adjacent plants and nearby plantations. The disease can also be spread on taro planting material and the fungus has been reported as remaining alive on planting tops for about three weeks after harvest (Jackson, 1999). This is the most likely source of the pathogen in new countries and the means for its rapid spread within a country, once established. Therefore, strict quarantine measures are required as a first line of defense against the disease. In addition to corm yield losses due to the reduced leaf area in diseased plants, there is also a corm rot caused by P. colocasiae. This is mainly a problem when taro corms are stored for more than seven days but not in subsistence economies where corms are harvested and consumed within days. Fortunately, P. colocasiae does not have a wide host range. Xanthosoma taro is immune. Although Alocasia taro can be infected by the pathogen, there is little inoculum produced and therefore little likelihood of an epidemic on this host (personal observation). Raciborski (1900), in Java, was the first person to study taro leaf blight disease and was the first to name the causal pathogen. There is limited information on the origin of P. colocasiae and the magnitude of the area of origin remains to be defined (Zhang et al., 1994). Ko (1979) has indicated that Asia may be the centre of origin of P. colocasiae given that it is the world's 3 Taro Genetic Resources: Conservation and Utilisation centre of origin for many wild and cultivated varieties of taro. Prior to this, Trujillo (1967) had also speculated on a Southeast Asian origin for the pathogen. One of the indications of the centre of origin of a fungus such as Phytophthora is the existence of an AlIA2 mating type ratio of about 1:1 (Zentmyer, 1988). In order to determine if Taiwan was inside the centre of origin Ann et al. (1986) screened 799 isolates of P. colocasiae. All behaved as A2 mating types, indicating that the fungus is not indigenous to this area. Only A 1 mating type has been found in India, indicating that it is not the centre of origin (N arula and Mehrotra, 1980). Evidence for an Asian origin of P. colocasiae has recently come from China (Zhang et aI., 1994), where previous reports had indicated that only the A2 mating type occurred (Ho et al., 1983). Of 280 isolates of P. colocasiae obtained from Hainan Island, 136 were AI, 102 A2 and 42 AO mating types. Such findings indicate that Hainan Island is inside the centre of origin of P. colocasiae. More recent work suggests that only mating type A2 occurs in Papua New Guinea (PNG), Hawai'i, Samoa and Guam (Fullerton et al., 2000) Based on a possible Southeast Asian origin for the pathogen, Trujillo (1967) postulated that the disease dispersed into the Pacific region by three different routes: 1. To Hawai'i via the Philippines; 2. From Taiwan to Micronesia via the Philippines; and 3. to Fiji via PNG and Solomon Islands. At that time taro leaf blight had been reported as present in Fiji but this was an obvious misidentification. The movement oftaro leaf blight via PNG and Solomon Islands would appear to be a separate route and is supported by anecdotal evidence from inhabitants of these countries expressing that the disease only appeared after the Western Pacific Campaign of World War II (Oliver, 1973). Ooka (1990) speculates that movement on the northern route went from Java to Taiwan, where Sawada reported the disease in 1911. From Taiwan it is believed to have moved to Japan and then to Hawai'i where it arrived in 1920 (Carpenter, 1920). The disease was first recorded in the Philippines in 1916 and movement to Micronesia probably occurred from there. The disease was recorded in Guam in 1918 (Weston, 1918). History of taro leaf blight in the Pacific Islands There has been little documentation of the impact of taro leaf blight as it has spread from country to country in the Pacific. What has been documented covers mainly Papua New Guinea. What is known is that wherever it has occurred in the region, many growers have been forced to abandon taro and rely on other root crops (Jackson, 1996). The earliest records for the appearance of the disease in the Pacific Islands are for Guam (1918) and Hawai'i (1920), which precede the appearance of the disease in the more southern Solomon Islands and PNG by a couple of decades. Prior to the arrival of taro leaf blight in Hawai'i there were approximately 350 different varieties of taro in the country. Few have survived the disease and today the number of Hawaiian taros is less than 40 (Trujillo, 1996). In Guam, where the disease has been present for a longer period than Hawai'i, the disease is considered unimportant today (Wall, 1996). Recent interviews among farmers in Guam have highlighted that there may be as many as 23 varieties of taro on Guam but most are recent introductions with only six predating the arrival of taro leaf blight (Manner, 1991). The relatively few traditional taro varieties is believed to be a consequence of the disease (Wall, 1996). 4 A Bibliography of Taro LeajBlight In Micronesia the disease seems to have been brought in during the Japanese occupation of Chuuk and Pohnpei and taro cultivation appears to be declining rapidly. Taro leaf blight has contributed to significant changes in dietary patterns and cropping systems in Micronesia where earlier this century cassava became the staple instead of taro (Barrau, 1961; Jackson, 1996). On Pohnpei, the majority of the taro varieties that existed before the arrival of the Japanese are gone (Trujillo, 1996) and leaf blight has been responsible for the serious decline in taro as a crop plant (Santos, 1993; Raynor and Silbanus, 1993). On Pohnpei, taro now ranks behind yams, banana, imported rice and breadfruit as a staple crop (Primo, 1993; Raynor and Silbanus, 1993). Despite heavy rainfall and the long time presence of leaf blight in Pohnpei, farmers are still managing to produce taro. Wall (1996) reports that this is a result of the disease having selected more resistant taro varieties and the incorporation of sanitation and traditional mixed cropping systems for the management of the disease. Taro leaf blight is believed to have contributed to the decline in taro production and its displacement in some areas by sweet potato in PNG. It is thought that the disease spread to PNG from Southeast Asia through Indonesia during the WWII (Kokoa, 1996). In Bougainville, P. colocasiae was first reported around the close of the war (Connell, 1978). It was the firm belief of the local population that the disease was not present before then. The impact of the disease in some areas was devastating and throughout lowland Bougainville taro was almost wiped out. It has been reported that the epidemic of taro leaf blight on Bougainville resulted in the deaths of about 3000 people (Putter, 1993) and in most areas sweet potato replaced taro as the main staple. The real impact of the blight is difficult to accurately assess. At the time of the appearance of the disease the Japanese were pillaging many of the local taro gardens. As a result, there was a serious lack of planting materials. Many people fled their villages and numerous cases of starvation and malnutrition occurred. It is difficult to distinguish the impact of the disease, if any, from these events. It is possible that the impact of the disease was delayed for a few years following the Japanese occupation. At the close of WWII people returned to village life. As the Japanese had taken most of the planting material people turned to many of the early maturing sweet potato varieties that existed in the now disbanded Japanese gardens to fill the interim. Later, when taro planting material did become available, it was wiped out again by the blight providing yet another setback for farmers. Unfortunately, the coincidence of the spread of taro leaf blight in Bougainville with WWII makes it difficult to attribute any given change solely to the effects of leaf blight (Packard, 1975). The disease continues to spread in PNG and in 1976 a severe epidemic occurred on the island of Manus and in 1988 the disease occurred in Milne Bay for the first time, destroying the crop (Jackson, 1996). In Solomon Islands it is also difficult to determine the impact that taro leaf blight had on taro production and cropping patterns in the country. Taro leaf blight first appeared in the Shortland Islands in 1946 (Liloqula et al., 1996) and within the next few years had spread to most of the provinces as a result of the increased movement of people and produce in the post war years. What is known is that taro cultivation declined quite drastically in Solomon Islands at this time being replaced by sweet potato, which was a later arrival in the country. Whether the introduction of sweet potato alone or combined with the effects of taro leaf blight are the reasons for the decline in taro are difficult to ascertain. 5 Taro Genetic &sources: Conseroation and Utilisation The impact of taro leaf blight in Samoa The most recent introduction of the disease was to the Samoan islands in 1993. Taro leaf blight was first detected in the Western District highlands of Tutuila Island, American Samoa on 15 June 1993. The disease has severely constrained taro production in the country (Gurr, 1996). Within a year of the introduction of the disease it had caused over 95% reduction in the supply of taro to the public market. In less than one month taro leaf blight was diagnosed and confirmed in Samoa. It was first observed on the the island of Upolu at Aufaga Aleipata and two days later from Saanapu adjacent districts of Alafou, Samusu, Utufaalalafa, Malaela, and Lepa. The crop at this time was highly uniform and genetically vulnerable. The disease spread rapidly throughout the country severely affecting all local varieties, but was most severe on taro variety Niue, which was unfortunate as this was the variety of choice for commercial production because of its quality and taste. It is believed that the rapid spread of the disease was encouraged by the movement of infected planting materials around the two main islands, Upolu and Savai'i. At this time there was a major replanting of taro underway in the aftermath of Cyclone Val and anything up to 10,000 plants could be planted by a single farmer in a one week period (Semisi, 1996). Various factors contributed to the rapid spread of the disease in Samoa. The area planted with taro Niue at the time was extremely large and effectively ensured a monocrop situation comprising a highly susceptible variety. There was a continuous and abundant source of taro for the disease because of the practice of many farmers to interplant on old plantations and stagger their cultivation. Combined with the movement of planting material and the ideal weather conditions that exist in Samoa for the disease, it is not surprising that the disease reached epidemic proportions. Taro in Samoa is the traditionally favoured root crop and was considered an essential component of an everyday meal. Although this popularity is based on dietary and cultural factors, taro is also favoured for its considerable productivity in the fertile and high rainfall environment. Prior to the disease outbreak taro was the major export earner in the country and over 90% of households in Samoa were growing the crop (Ward and Ashcroft, 1998). In the twelve-month period prior to the outbreak of taro leaf blight 180,191 kg of taro were brought for sale at the local market. In the twelve-month period subsequent to the outbreak of the disease 59,212 kg were brought in for sale. Seventy-five per cent of this volume was brought in during the first three months of the twelve-month period when the impact of the disease was still to be realised (Chan, 1996). Paulson and Rogers (1997) report that supplies of taro on the local market in June 1994 were only 1 % of the supplies that were available in June the previous year. The massive losses due to the disease had a similar impact on the export of taro. The first three months of 1994 saw only 60,000 kg of taro exported which was valued at about WS$56,000 (Chan, 1996). This represents about 0.5% of the 1993 export figure. One of the initial responses of the Samoan Government to the disease was to encourage diversification of other crops, helping to explore alternative commercial agricultural enterprises (Semisi, 1996; Jackson, 1996). The government also provided assistance through the supply and distribution of planting material. Farmers quickly diversified into a range of other staple crops and bananas and taamu (Alocasia macrorhiza) replaced taro as the main staple. 6 A Bibliography of Taro Leaf Blight Management of taro leaf blight The recent outbreak of taro leaf blight in Samoa provides a good overview of the measures that have been used in an attempt to manage the disease. Initial efforts to minimise the disease Early efforts to contain taro leaf blight in Samoa included a spraying programme of infected plantings with the fungicides Ridomil MZ and Manzate. Staff from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries and Meteorology (MAFFM) carried out routine fungicide spraying of infected plantations. Later, fungicides were supplied free to farmers through village pulenuu (village mayors) and application equipment was made available at subsidised prices at the local Agricultural Store (Chan, 1996). At the completion of this initial spraying campaign over WST$600,000 had been spent. In conjunction with fungicide spraying, quarantine efforts to minimise the movement of planting material, leaves and soil on the island of Upolu and between islands were enforced together with a public awareness campaign to inform farmers and the general public. This included information on disease symptoms, epidemiology and disease control. The campaign utilised radio, television, videos and print media including leaflets and newspaper. These three actions had minimal effect on the spread of the disease. Un seasonal wet weather in the months following the introduction of the disease into Samoa and the fact that planting material was still being routinely moved meant the disease spread rapidly. By the end of 1993 the disease had spread to most of Savai'i and farmers were beginning to diversify with alternative crops. Cultural control Various cultural methods have been recommended for the control of taro leaf blight. Removal of infected leaves has been effective during the early stages of disease development in a number of countries. Wide spacing of plants has been reported to reduce disease severity but this appears to have a negligible effect when conditions favour disease development. Other cultural methods that have been recommended include delaying planting on the same land for a minimum of three weeks, avoiding plantings close to older infected ones and preventing the carryover of corms or suckers which can harbour the pathogen from one crop to the next (Jackson, 1999). Preliminary findings have indicated that fertilizer treatment may also help the plant cope with leaf blight (Tilialo et al., 1996). Trials in Samoa to investigate the effect of planting time, intercropping, the role of fertilisation on the incidence and severity of the disease and the effect ofleafremoval have been inconclusive (Chan, 1997). Chemical control Jackson (1996) reports that the disease can be controlled by spraying copper fungicides. Copper oxychloride applied at a rate of 4.5 kg per 100 litres of water per hectare gave good control of the disease in Solomon Islands. Early trial work in Samoa concentrated on trials of Ridomil MZ, Manzate and phosphorous acid (Foschek). Pot experiments demonstrated the superiority of phosphorous acid over Ridomil MZ. Further experiments comparing phosphorous acid formulations (Foschek, Agri-Fos 400 and Foli-R-Fos) found no differences 7 Taro Genetic Resources: Conservation and Utilisation in terms of disease control (Chan, 1997). In Samoa, a recommendation for fungicide spraying was made for Foschek, alternated with Manzate to minimise resistance problems but the costs were prohibitive for the majority of farmers. Resistant varieties Most farmers who traditionally grow taro cannot afford the extra costs required for fungicides and labour involved in leaf removal and spraying. Alternative sustainable strategies for the management of the disease are needed. The use of resistant varieties is one such strategy. Given the susceptibility of local taro varieties to leaf blight in Samoa and the impact that the disease has had on varietal diversity, Samoa initiated a programme to screen and evaluate exotic taros. Of those varieties screened in the field PSB-G2, Pwetepwet, Pastora and Toantal were found to be more resistant to leaf blight. Pwetepwet, Pastora and Toantal originated from the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and were obtained from the Tissue Culture Unit at Alafua Campus, USP. PSB-G2 was received from the Philippine Seed Board in 1994. These four varieties were further multiplied and evaluated in trials at USP-Alafua during 1996-1998. A preliminary trial demonstrated that disease severity recorded for each variety was not significantly different. Pastora produced the largest corms followed by PSB-G2, Pwetepwet and Toantal (Hunter and Pouono, 1998). Samoans prefer dry, firm-textured taro and therefore, per cent dry weight is one measure of eating quality. Dry matter content of corms was highest for PSB-G2 (37%) and taste tests at USP-Alafua demonstrated that both Toantal and PSB-G2 were most preferred. MAFFM taste tests also rated PSB-G2 highest followed by Toantal (Chan, 1997). Acceptibility of PSB-G2 (known locally as taro Fili) in Samoa has been high and a recent impact assessment carried out among farmers on the multiplication, performance and use of the variety confirms that it is performing well (Iosefa and Rogers, 1999). Additional varieties collected from Palau have shown good levels of resistance against taro leaf blight in Samoa. Indications are that farmers in Samoa are adopting a diversity of varieties from the FSM, Palau and the Philippines. Taro Genetic Resources: Conservation and Utilisation (TaroGen)\u00ad a regional approach to taro improvement The impact of taro leaf blight, the subsequent loss of taro genetic resources, and the continuing vulnerability of other Pacific Island countries to the disease was the major impetus behind the development of the Taro Genetic Resources: Conservation and Utilisation (TaroGen) regional project In recognition of the urgency of the problem, three regional meetings to discuss disease control, loss of genetic resources and ways to prevent further spread of the disease were held in the region between 1993 and 1995. Outcomes from these meetings contributed to the formulation of the TaroGen project. The project is implemented by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and funded by the Australian Government. The project represents a collaboration with the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute, National Agricultural Research Institute and the University of the South Pacific and is working with national programmes to develop a regional strategy for taro genetic resource conservation and crop improvement. A unit has been established within SPC to provide the expertise required in conservation, plant breeding and project management. The project is designed to assist Pacific Island countries in the collection and conservation of taro 8 A Bibliography of Taro Leaf Blight germplasm and in the use of the genetic resources in plant improvement programmes with an overall goal of improving food security and rural incomes in Pacific Island countries. One of the main components of TaroGen is to provide farmers in Pacific Island countries with taro varieties that have improved resistance to taro leaf blight. To achieve this the project supports breeding programmes in PNG and Samoa based on durable resistance. Breeding of more resistant varieties together with the introduction of resistant varieties is the most sustainable approach to managing the disease. Improved taro with good resistance to taro leaf blight and quality is now available in Samoa and PNG. In Samoa, the project partners, USP and MAFFM, have been very successful in developing a strong partnership between growers, researchers and extension staff. This partnership is ensuring that improved taro is readily available to farmers. Growers in Samoa have access to improved taro from both the USP and MAFFM programmes after only two years of the project. This approach has created considerable interest in PNG where a similar farmer participatory approach is now under consideration. TaroGen plans to make these improved lines, and other resistant varieties, available to farmers in other Pacific Island countries. Conclusions The recent introduction of taro leaf blight into Samoa illustrates clearly the devastation that taro leaf blight can cause and highlights the vulnerability of isolated taro populations that for years evolved in the absence of the disease. Unfortunately, other countries in the Pacific are in a similar position to that of Samoa before the blight. In Fiji production is dominated by Niue, which was the dominant cultivar in Samoa at the time of the blight's arrival. This represents a situation of severe genetic vulnerability and a rerun of the Samoan epidemic could happen anytime. Fortunately, those countries most at risk now have the opportunity to benefit from the outputs from the TaroGen breeding programme. Improved taro with good resistance to taro leaf blight can provide these countries with the opportunity to minimise the impact of the disease. 9 A Bibliograpf?y of Taro Leaf Blight Taro Leaf Blight Bibliography 1.

Saurara in Upolu, Samoa, on farmers' attitudes to taro leaf blight control are reported. 30% of farmers now use a fungicide spray (Forschek, a phosphorous acid-based product) to control the disease, some at double the recommended rate to improve results. Cultural control, by removing infected leaves or parts of leaves, was generally not popular, as corm yields are reduced. This latter method is mainly used by small holders. 2. Adams, E. (1999).

The of 4 homeopathic drugs (Kali iodide (potassium iodide), Arsenicum album (arsenic oxide), Blatta oriental is (an extract of cockroach) and extract of Thuja occidentalis) on the mycelial growth, sporangial production, pectolytic and cellulolytic enzyme production and control of P. colocasiae on taro (Colocasia esculenta) was investigated. All 4 drugs inhibited mycelial growth, but the percentage inhibition varied with different drug potencies. Max. inhibition (50-90%) was obtained by Kali iodide and Arsenicum album at all 3 potencies (3, 30 and 200) and by Blatta orientalis and T. occidentalis at potencies of 30 and 200. The effect on sporulation also varied with potency, with max. inhibition caused by each drug at a potency of 200, and by a potency of 30 for Arsenicum album. Kali iodide resulted in the greatest decrease in pectolytic and celluloytic activity, followed by Arsenicum, Thuja and Blatta. The occurrence of disease was reduced by 45- 59% compared with an untreated control when taro leaves were treated with Kali iodide or Arsenicum album (both at 200 potencies) prior to inoculation with P. colocasiae. 42.

Roguing of infected leaves did not eradicate the pathogen but may delay the start of epiphytotics. 43. Ashok Aggarwal, & Mehrotra, R. S. (1988). Effect of antibiotics on growth, enzyme activity and respiration of Phytophthora colocasiae. Plant Disease Research 3(1),37-42. Details are given of the in vitro effects of 7 antibiotics on this pathogen of Colocasia esculenta. Ledermycin had the greatest effect on respiration and growth, while all the antibiotics had significant effects on the activities of transeliminases, hydro lases and cellulases. 44.

S. (1988). Effect of systemic and non-systemic fungicides on mycelial growth and respiration of 500 p.p.m. on P. colocasiae mycelial growth and respiration rate was investigated. All the fungicides inhibited the fungus. The results suggest a correlation between mycelial growth inhibition and respiration rate inhibition. All the fungicides which inhibited mycelial growth also significantly inhibited respiration rate. None of the fungicides tested stimulated respiration or mycelial growth. 46. Ashok Aggarwal, & Mehrotra, R. S. (1988). Effects of various fungicides on mycelial growth, sporangial production, enzyme activity and the effects of 23 fungicides on P. colocasiae revealed that 100% inhibition at different concentrations. All fungicides had some effect on sporangial formation. The effects of 8 fungicides on pectolytic and cellulolytic enzyme activity were also observed. All inhibited the enzymes to some degree with metalaxyl (as Ridomil25 WP followed by Apron 350 FW) being the most effective. It was also the most effective at 200 parts per million of 8 fungicides tested in field conditions. 47. Ashok Aggarwal, & Mehrotra, R. S. (1986).

Pectin methylesterase (PME) activity was not detected in the isolates in vivo. Pectolytic enzymes produced by these fungi were of a constitutive rather than adaptive nature. These results indicate that PG, PMG and PMTE enzymes playa decisive role in the pathogenesis of P. colocasiae on C. esculenta and P. nicotianae var. parasitica on Piper betle. 48.

Journal of the Indian Botanical Society 66(3-4), 272-274. Alterations in phenolic compounds in Colocasia due to P. colocasiae infection are reported. Total phenols, orthodihydric phenols and flavonols markedly increased as a result of infection. Eleven phenols were detected in the infected plants as against 7 in healthy plants. Each stage of infection was characterized by an addition of a new phenol (4 in all, UI-U4). A close correlation existed between the phenolic acids produced by the pathogen in vitro and those in the infected plant. The implication of the occurrence of new phenols and further accumulation of the already existing phenols, as a result of infection, on disease development is discussed. 49.

All the growth regulators tested (IAA, IBA, GA, K, 2,3,4-T) and 10 and 100 p.p.m. checked the production of polygalacturonate transeliminase and pectin methyl transeliminase by this pathogen of Colocasia esculenta, but none could completely prevent it. Ferulic acid, m-hydroxybenzaldehyde, phloroglucinol and vanillin at 10, 50 and 100 p.p.m. were also inhibitory, as were all 6 fungicides tested, especially Apron 350 FW (metalaxyl), Ridomil 25 WP (metalaxyl) and Topsin M (thiophanate-methyl). 18 A Bibliography of Taro LecifBlight 50.

At the drier of the 2 sites rate of fungicide had no effect, while at the wetter site (0.25 em/week more rainfall) the highest rate of fungicide was more effective than the lowest. Spraying every 5 days was significantly more effective than spraying every 14 days. Applications of fungicide at 7-day 19 Taro Genetic Resources: Conservation and Utilisation intervals when weekly accumulated rainfall exceeded 1 cm and/or when lesion counts exceeded 1/plant, gave substantial disease control. Yields at the wetter site were 8.66 and 11.19 kg primary corms/plant with no fungicide and with 1.12 kg mancozeb/ha, respectively, and significantly higher (14.26 and 16.71 kg/plant) at the 2 highest fungicide rates.

In experiment 1, analysis of variance showed a significant increase in corm weight in all plots treated with metalaxyl (P<O.OOl) but no difference in yield between treatments. In the second experiment, treated plots again showed a significant increase in corm yield: 5 applications of metalaxyl at 3-week intervals resulted in an increase of almost 50%. 24 A Bibliography of Taro Leaf Blight 93. Cox, P. G., & Kasimani, C. (1987). Effect of blight on leaf area duration, leaf number and marginal unit leaf rate of taro, 15 pp. Kerevat, Papua New Guinea: Department of Agriculture and Livestock, Lowlands Agricultural Experiment Station. Leaf blight substantially reduces both the leaf area duration and the marginal unit leaf rate of taro. Leaf number is the principal component of leaf area duration affected by blight. Use of effective leaf area does not correct for differences in the unit leaf rate. A model is presented which explains this in terms of the division of labour along the plant axis. The implications of variation in the rate of yield accumulation for the control of taro leaf blight in farmers' gardens are discussed. Two disease indices are proposed: (1) percentage loss of leaf number (for the comparison of different varieties); and (2) percentage of growing period affected by blight (for the comparison of different disease progress curves). 94. Cox, P. G., & Kasimani, C. (1990). Effect of taro leaf blight on leaf number. Papua New Guinea Journal of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 35(1-4), 43-48. Setts of taro (Colocasia esculenta) cultivar K264 were in a randomized complete block design with 5 replicates of 4 treatments: plants inoculated with Phytophthora colocasiae at 78, 105 or 133 d after planting or uninoculated in control plots. The number of leaves declined following inoculation, reaching an equilibrium after 3-6 weeks. Leaf number was then similar in all inoculated plants. The number of older leaves was reduced by the blight, but the rate of leaf production was unaffected. Yield from all inoculated plants was significantly reduced (P<O.Ol) but there was no significant difference between inoculated plots. 95. Cox, P. G., & Kasimani, C. (1987). Effect on leaf number on varietal reaction to taro leaf blight, 12 pp. Lae, Papua New Guinea: Department of Agriculture and Livestock, Bubia Agricultural Research Centre. Leaf blight reduces the cumulative leaf number of taro. A plant with more leaves suffers a greater proportional loss of leaf number in the presence of blight, and a correspondingly greater proportional loss in mean corm weight. It is concluded that this has implications for the design of improved taro cultivars. 96. Das, S. R. (1997). Field efficacy of fungicides for the control ofleaf blight disease of taro. Journal of Mycology and Plant Pathology 27(3),337-338. Field experiments were conducted at the Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India, for the 3 successive kharif seasons of 1991-93 to test the efficacy of copper oxychloride, mancozeb, metalaxyl, captafol, ziram and Bordeaux colocasiae) of taro (Colocasia esculenta var. antiquorum). The local variety, Telia, was used as a test crop. Fungicides were sprayed when disease symptoms first appeared and repeated twice at 14-day intervals. 25 Taro Genetic \"Resources: ConsertJation and Utilisation Leaf blight severity and marketable corm yield were recorded for each treatment. All fungicides significantly reduced leaf blight intensity and increased corm yields in comparison with the untreated control. Metalaxyl + mancozeb gave significantly more effective disease control than the other fungicides followed by mancozeb and Bordeaux mixture. Mancozeb recorded the highest corm yield (95.6 q/ha). It is concluded that leaf blight oftaro can be effectively managed by giving 3 sprays of metalaxyl + mancozeb or mancozeb alone starting at the onset of the disease and repeating at fortnightly intervals. 97.

Field resistance to blight Phytophthora colocasiae in Colocasia esculenta Schott. Current 29(8), 320-321. The progress of taro leaf blight in the field resistant cultivar, Ahina, and susceptible Patna Local was compared. Fewer sporangia of the fungus were produced on the resistant cultivar and the disease progressed at a much slower rate. The reaction on the resistant cultivar was much more severe. It is concluded that the observed field resistance is a weak hypersensitive reaction. 100. Dey, T. K., Ali, M. S., Bhuiyan, M. K. R., & Siddique, A. M. (1993). Screening of Colocasia esculenta (L.)

The influence of agar media, temperature and liquid substrates on vegetative growth and sporangial production of P. colocasiae was investigated. Oat meal agar with yeast extract and V -8 juice agar gave maximum vegetative growth and mycelial density. Highest vegetative growth and mycelial density was recorded at 25 +/-1 C. Rain water was the best liquid substrate for sporangial production followed by charcoal water at 20 +/-1 C. 26 A Bibliography of Taro Leaf Blight 102. Dingley, J. M., Fullerton, R. A., & McKenzie, E.

The mode of sporangial germination was investigated in both distilled and tap water at various temp. (10-30 C) and incubation durations. Both direct and indirect germination of sporangia took place. At 100, indirect germination began within 15 min and 100% germination took place after 2 h, while at 300 it started after 30 min and only 18% of sporangia germinated indirectly after 2 h. Direct germination occurred up to 6.1 % at 300 after 3 h and even after 24 h but at 100 no direct germination was observed. 124. Ghosh, S. K., & Sitansu Pan. (1989).

The involvement of cell wall degrading enzymes in the pathogenesis of P. colocasiae on Colocasia esculenta was investigated using 3 isolates of the pathogen with high, medium and low virulence. In in vitro experiments using culture filtrates, production of polygalacturonase (PG), pectin methyl esterase (PME) and polymethyltranseliminase (PMTE) was greatest for the isolate with high virulence; no polymethylgalacturonase (PMG) activity was determined. In further in vivo tests on detached leaves, PMTE, PMG and PG activity was highest for the most virulent isolate; no PME activity was determined. 127. Giri, D., Banerjee, K, Laha, S. K, & Khatua, D.

Annals of Applied Biology 94(3),379-390. The fungus was isolated by baiting with detergent-treated taro leaf discs placed on water slurries of soil, on suspensions of macerated leaf lesions or on washings from petioles of harvested plants. Inoculum on detached leaf lesions or in soil remained viable for only a few days, and that on petiole bases (used for vegetative propagation) for 2 days if stored dry, but for 14 days if planted in the field immediately. Artificial augmentation of surface inoculum with naturally produced sporangia extended the period of inoculum detectability. Incubation of inoculated tops under high humidity led to active infection and sporulation on petioles, especially the cut ends. Of several aroids tested only Alocasia macrorrhiza proved susceptible but it has not been found naturally infected. Thus perennation between crops is effected by short-lived, surface propagules and possibly by mycelium within petiole 31 Taro Genetic Rtsources: Conservation and Utilisation lesions. Reduction of the former and prevention of the latter might be achieved by dry storage of tops (used for propagation) for 2-3 weeks. 132. Gomez, E. T. (1925).

Tropical Agriculture (Trinidad) 75(1), 39-44. Five cultivars of taro and 2 other related aroids were screened for the induction of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins in response to infection by Phytophthora colocasiae. Extracellular fluid from infected leaves was tested for PR protein expression by SDS-PAGE analysis and activity gels were used to measure the activity of the known PR proteins, beta-I,3-glucanase, proteinase inhibitors and peroxidase). Infected plants showed increased levels of PR proteins but this did not correlate with resistance in the most susceptible cultivars. Despite high levels of some PR proteins, infection still occurred in these cultivars. Successful resistance in other plants was more closely linked to the pattern of expression of proteinase inhibitors which appear to be an important defence strategy in taro in related aroids. 151.

This paper documents the arrival and impact oftaro leaf blight on the Samoan economy and initial attempts to try and contain the spread of the disease. The article focuses on the need for breeding for resistance as the most sustainable approach for management of the disease and compares conventional and participatory methods. 162. Hunter, D., & Pouono, K (1998). Evaluation of exotic taro cultivars for resistance to taro leaf blight, yield and quality in Samoa. Journal of South Pacific Agriculture 5(2), 39-43. Four taro cultivars (Pwetepwet, PSB-G2, Pastora and Toantal) were screened and evaluated in trials at the University of the South Pacific Alafua Campus, Samoa, for their resistance to taro leaf blight, and for their yield and eating quality. Disease severity levels were not significantly different for any of the cultivars studied. Corm yields were highest for Pastora, followed by PSB-G2, Pwetepwet and Toantal. Toantal and PSB-G2 rated highest for taste and dry weight. 163. Hunter, D., Pouono, K, & Semisi, S. (1998). The impact of taro leaf blight in the Pacific Islands with special reference to Samoa.

Faculty of Agriculture, Cenderawasih University, Manokwari, Indonesia, 23-24 November 1994. (pp.93-96). Resistance to taro leaf blight was studied under screenhouse, nursery and field conditions, and in special 'water beds'. The density of plants, temperature and humidity appeared to be the most important factors influencing infection and spread of the fungus. Plants growing in extremely hot and humid plastic cages showed higher susceptibility than those growing under normal conditions. Of all the methods, only that using water beds allowed the detection of different levels of resistance and susceptibility to P. colocasiae. 170. Ivancic, A., Kokoa, P., Simin, A., & Gunua, T. (1996). Mendelian studies of resistance to taro leaf blight. In The Second Taro Symposium. Proceedings of an International Meeting. Faculty of Agriculture, Cenderawasih University, Manokwari, Indonesia, 23-24 November 1994. (pp. 97-100). Self-pollination and crossing between taro varieties indicated that the majority of Papua New Guinea genotypes are heterozygous for resistance to taro leaf blight. The most frequent ratios in segregating populations resulting from crosses resistant X resistant and resistant X susceptible was 3: 1, 9:7 and 37 Taro Genetic fusources: Conservation and Utilisation 7:9. It is concluded that it is likely that more than one gene controls resistance to taro leaf blight. 171. Ivancic, A, Kokoa, P., Simin, A, & Gunua, colocasiae Racib. in taro Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott: a genetic study of segregating populations. Journal of South Pacific Agriculture 2(2), 17-21. Populations analysed in this study were developed from three groups of crosses: (a) resistant X resistant; (b) resistant X susceptible; and (c) susceptible X susceptible. The most frequent segregation ratios (resistant susceptible) were 3:1, 9:7, 7:9 and 13:3, suggesting that the number of genes controlling resistance to P. colocasiae in taro may be relatively low. The appearance of resistant genotypes in populations resulting from crosses between two (partially) susceptible genotypes indicates that minor genes associated with partial resistance may be involved. 172. Ivancic, A, & Okpul, T. (1996). A new mutation of taro (Colocasia esculenta) observed at Bubia Agricultural Research Centre. Papua New Guinea Journal of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 39(2),6-9. An unusual mutant of taro was discovered in the cycle-2 population of the recurrent selection programme at the Bubia Agricultural Research Centre, Papua New Guinea. The mutant plant developed a thin elongated stem (about 95 cm long). The stem had several nodes, each carrying 1 leaf. The leaf size decreased with distance from the corm top. The stem was filled with soft, aerated spongy tissue. Side stems were thin and relatively long, growing from lower nodes of the main stem and the corm top. Their structure was similar to that of the main stem. The plant had a normal corm. It was susceptible to Phytophthora leaf blight and did not flower. Authors' summary. 173. Ivancic, A, Simin, A, Ososo, E., & Okpul, T. (1995). Wild taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott.) populations in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea Journal of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 38(1),31-45. Wild taro populations were evaluated for breeding purposes in several locations of Papua New Guinea. All evaluated populations were found to be susceptible to taro leaf blight (Phytophthora colocasiae) and the Alomae\u00ad Bobone virus complex. Absence of taro leaf symptoms was mainly due to isolation of the population (the pathogen did not reach the population). Flowering ability was relatively high. At least a few plants were found to be flowering in each population. The analysis of quantitative variation indicates that there was relatively high uniformity in leaf dimensions and number of lamina veins within populations. Relatively low variation of measured quantitative characteristics and uniformity in qualitative traits indicate that seed propagation may be extremely rare and that at least some PNG wild taro populations may consist of a single clone. It is concluded that in breeding, wild taro genotypes can be used as sources of genes for the improvement of flowering ability, environmental adaptability (for swampy or dry land conditions), growth vigour and earliness. 38 A Bibliography of Taro Leaf Blight 174.

The varying needs of countries are identified as those where outbreaks are recent (American and Western Samoa), where outbreaks are long-established (Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea) and those countries still free of taro leaf blight. Research needed in the first two categories is outlined and contingency plans, emergency response groups, quarantine surveillance and community awareness campaigns highlighted as necessary for the third. The need for a regional approach to the disease is also flagged to prevent further spread. 39 Taro Genetic Resources: Conservation and Utilisation 179. Jackson, G. V. H. (1977). Taro leaf blight.

More than 200 local varieties were screened for resistance to Phytophthora colocasiae. Of these only Abumae has shown promise. However, the taste and texture of this variety are unacceptable. 186. Jackson, G. V. H., & Gollifer, D. E. (1975). Storage rots of taro (Colocasia esculenta) in the British Solomon Islands. Annals of Applied Biology 80 (2), 217-230. Several fungicides chosen for their ability to control the pathogens previously isolated from stored cocoyam corms failed to prevent severe rotting. This result led to a reappraisal of the organisms involved in the initial stages of decay. Isolations made from stored corms during the first 5 days showed that Phytophthora colocasiae and Pythium splendens were the dominant fungi rots. Later Botryodiplodia theobromae rapidly colonized the corms to complete the decay. Attempts to reduce losses by leaving petiole bases, cormels and roots attached only succeeded in delaying infection by a few days. Corms placed in soil in well-drained pits stored relatively well up to 4 weeks without impaired taste. Fungal rots were completely eliminated in corms stored in the soil, but bacterial rots caused by Erwinia chrysanthemi were responsible for some decay. 187. Jackson, G. V. H., & Gollifer, D. E.

Noumea, New Caledonia: South Pacific Commission. SPC Technical Paper No. 174. Phytophthora colocasiae has become a limiting factor on taro (Colocasia esculenta) production and has caused an increasing dependence upon sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). The fungus attacks both leaves and corms. However, corm-rots caused by P. colocasiae do not develop in the field, but extensive infection occurs after harvest. Within 5 days corms are often completely decayed. Control measures, using fungicides and screening for resistant varieties, are discussed. 188. Jackson, G. V. H., Gollifer, D. E., & Newhook, F. J. (1980). Studies on the taro leaf blight fungus Phytophthora colocasiae in Solomon Islands: control by fungicides and spacing. Annals of Applied Biology 96(1), 1-10. 41 Taro Genetic Resources: Conservation and Utilisation In trials in 1972-4, mist blower application of 2.25 kg copper oxychloridelha gave effective control of P. colocasiae and increased main plant and sucker plant corm yields to 10.74 and 2.79 tlha respectively compared with 6.78 t and 1.88 t in untreated controls. Mancozeb did not control the disease or increase corm yields. Phytotoxicity from captafol nullified any potential gain in yield from disease control. Leaf removal from healthy plants to maintain 4 leaves/plant for 90 days to simulate roguing of leaves for disease control caused no yield loss. Regular roguing of diseased leaves over the same period in plots affected by a severe epiphytotic did not eradicate the pathogen. Disease increased rapidly after roguing ceased and corm yields were greatly decreased. Attempts to decrease the effect of P. colocasiae by wider than traditional spacing (76 X 76 cm) were unsuccessful. Plants free from competition normally had 6-7 leaves but this number was decreased by severe disease to 3-4, the same number as was borne by plants under the competitive conditions of closer than traditional spacing. Main corm yields increased with increasing plant density irrespective of the presence of P. colocasiae. 189. Jackson, G. V. R., Gollifer, D. E., Pinegar, J. A., & Newhook, F. J. (1979).

Boulder, Colorado, USA: Westview Press. Westview Tropical Agriculture Series No. 1. The control of postharvest decay of taro, including that caused by Phytophthora colocasiae, is discussed. At 5 days, rots caused by P. colocasiae, which were the first to develop in stored corms, were controlled by most of the fungicides tested. Best results were given by captan, copper oxychloride, captafol, mancozeb, Terrazole and sodium hypochlorite. Dipping in 1 % sodium hypochlorite before storage in polythene bags gave good results and may be a suitable method for village storage or where corms are being taken long distances to market. 190.

Unpublished 43 Taro Genetic Resources: Conservation and Utilisation doctoral dissertation, Kasetsart University, Graduate School., Bangkok, Thailand . In Thai. In this MSc thesis, the fungus that caused taro leaf blight during the rainy season was identified as Phytophthora colocasiae. Studies on the physiological properties of P. colocasiae demonstrated that the optimum temperature and pH for maximum mycelial growth were 25-30 C and pH 4- 8, respectively. This was found only when P. colocasiae was cultured on PDA with added taro extract and OMA media. P. colocasiae could successfully be mated with P. palmivora in the Al group. P. colocasiae is categorized as belonging to the A2 mating group. It is concluded that P. colocasiae is a heterothallic fungus. Pathogenicity tests showed that P. colocasiae could successfully infect and colonize all parts of the taro, except the rhizome. P. colocasiae produced clear and specific symptoms of concentric zones of leaf blight lesions. Morphological observation of P. colocasiae showed that it was capable of producing either ellipsoid or elongated ellipsoid zoosporangium in vivo. Indirect germination of this structure was found on taro leaf that yielded a large number of zoospores and later formed and encysted zoospores. Several germ tubes could be formed before direct penetration into intercellular space of the host epidermal cells. Evaluation on the fungitoxicity of various fungicides showed that Ridomil and Galben inhibited mycelial growth. Application of Ridomil at 250 ppm on taro leaves could visibly control the growth of P. colocasiae, but at higher dosea (2000 ppm) phytotoxicity was apparent. 200. Karanya, I., & Thammasak, S.

Four plant spacings (5000-40 000 plantslha) were tested in the Solomon Islands for their effects on damage by Papuana uninodis on taro. Total yields increased and mean corm weights increased with planting density, but no significant differences in beetle damage were found. However, increased plant density was accompanied by increasing damage to the leaves by Phytophthora colocasiae. 229. Maheshwari, S. K., Sahu, A K., & Misra, R. S. (1999).

A field trial was conducted over a 3 year period in Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India, to determine the effects of planting date of C. esculenta on disease severity caused by P. colocasiae and tuber yield. Five dates of planting starting from May 1, at intervals of 15 days were used as treatments. Planting on May 1 and May 15 resulted in higher yields compared with the other dates. However, the percentage of plants infected, the percentage leaf area damaged 50 A BibliograpfD! of Taro LecifBlight and the percentage of disease intensity were also higher on crops planted on these dates.

An extensive survey of major Colocasia growing areas in the states of Orissa, West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in northern and eastern parts of India was undertaken during 1988 and 1989 to record the incidence of leaf blight, caused by P. colocasiae. Out of 128 representative fields of Colocasia visited during the 1988 monsoon season, 94% of fields were infected by leaf blight, and 78.38% fields had >80% incidence. During 1989, of 164 fields visited 92% showed blight infection and 81.75% of fields showed >80% incidence. A strong positive correlation existed between disease severity and yield loss (r=0.867 and 0.84 in farmers field and experimental farm, respectively). A corresponding negative correlation existed between disease severity and tuber yield (r=0.884 and -0.661 in the farmers' field and experimental farm, respectively). In the farmers' fields a mean yield loss of33.64% was recorded due to leaf blight, whereas in the experimental farm 50.39 and 26.26% mean yield losses were recorded in susceptible and tolerant cultivars, respectively due to blight. 248.

Phytophthora leaf blight oftaro: effect on dry matter production. Journal of Root Crops 22(1),54-57. Phytophthora leaf blight of taro (Colocasia esculenta) appeared early and progressed fast in susceptible cultivars compared with tolerant ones. The effect of leaf blight on dry matter production was more pronounced in susceptible cultivars, and fungicide sprays increased dry matter accumulation (measured as crop growth rate) in susceptible cultivars. Crop growth rate was least influenced by leaf blight in the tolerant cultivar Jankhri, in which fungicidal spraying did not increase dry matter accumulation. Use of the tolerant cultivar without using fungicides is advocated to minimise the yield losses caused by Phytophthora. 253. Misra, R. S., & Singh, D. P. (1991).

Taro (Colocasia esculenta) varieties (35) resistant to blight (TLB) (Phytophthora colocasiae) were evaluated at Bubia Agricultural Research Centre, Lae, Papua New Guinea, for yield components and eating quality in comparison with the locally preferred cultivar, Numkowec. The main factors affecting eating quality were presence of conspicuous corm fibre and acridity. Leaf blight resistant varieties AN 65, 17, 50, 32, 46, 21, 12 and AN 20 had acceptable eating quality. Their corm yield ranged from 300 g/plot (AN 50) to 570 g/plot (AN 21). However, their corm yield was not significantly different from that of Numkowec (430 g/plot). These resistant varieties are recommended to farmers in the Lae area based on their resistance to TLB and their similarities in corm yield and eating quality to Numkowec. 269. Oliver, D. (1973).

The highest numbers of resistant genotypes were obtained from selfed tolerant lines, followed by open pollination of progenies of tolerant lines. A high proportion of second generation hybrids of tolerant cultivars also showed resistance. Selfed susceptible genotypes did not produce resistant lines, whereas crosses involving different susceptible lines gave a low percentage of resistant progeny. Genotypes with combined resistance, high yields and good cooking quality were identified. From a third cycle of segregating generations, 4 genotypes were identified with a high degree of resistance under field conditions and after artificial inoculation. 309. Pillai, S.

Five taro cultivars and 2 related aroids were screened for the induction of pathogenesis-related proteins in reponse to infection by Phytophthora colocasiae. Infected plants showed increased levels of PR proteins but this did not correlate with resistance in the most susceptible cultivars. Despite high levels of PR proteins, these cultivars were unable to prevent infection. Successful resistance in other plants was more closely linked to the pattern of expression of proteinase inhibitors, which appear to be an important defence strategy in taro and related aroids. 311.

Survival of Phytophthora colocasiae in field soil at various temperatures and water matric potentials. Plant Disease 82(2), 203-207. The survival of zoosporangia of P. colocasiae, isolated from Colocasia esculenta and produced on V8 agar, mixed with soil and stored at 3 soil water matric potentials and 4 temperatures was studied. A large number of the zoosporangia germinated by zoospore discharge and/or lysed in the soil during the first 5 days of incubation, decreasing the initial number of colony\u00ad forming units (c.f.u.) from lXI04 to lXI02 per g of soil in all treatments. Eighteen days after incorporation, the viable zoosporangia present in moist soils had thickened their cell walls and germinated only directly (i.e.,germinated by germ tube and hyphal production), often producing smaller zoosporangia. A few thick-walled chlamydospores were observed and they germinated only directly. Zoosporangia in soils at -1500 J/kg matric potential survived longer than 107 days and the amount of viable zoosporangia present at that time was approximately 0.IXI02 c.f.u./g of soil. The majority of the thin-walled zoosporangia produced on V8 agar, when incorporated into moist soil, germinated indirectly (i.e., by zoospore release) in the first 5 days of incubation. Zoosporangia that did not germinate became resting zoosporangia by increasing their wall thickness or by producing chlamydospores. These enabled the pathogen to survive in soil at -1500 J/kg matric potentiaHor more than 3 months. However, in the absence of the host, the pathogen is predicted to survive less than 1 year due to its lack of saprophytic ability to colonize non host tissues. 327. Quitugua, R. J., & Trujillo, E. E.

During 1989-92 the biological control of root-rot of mandarins caused by P. nicotianae var. parasitica and P. colocasiae was studied. T. harzianum, T. viride and Gliocladium virens were widely distributed in Citrus orchards in Kodagu, Karnataka, India, with populations of 200-2000 colony forming units/g soil. Seventeen isolates were highly antagonistic to both Phytophthora spp. in vitro. For large-scale fungal multiplication, local waste (coffee-cherry husk, fruit skin and berry mucilage, poultry manure and mushroom-grown waste) was a suitable substrate with 20-30 million colony forming units/g. Pot trials amended with coffee-cherry husk and poultry manure in a 1:2 ratio spray and drenching 0.2% chlorothalonil were the best chemical treatments for disease control and increased seedling growth. Isolates E, T3, 3HR and D of T. harzianum and isolate B of T. viride grown on coffee-cherry husk decreased the feeder root\u00ad rot and increased plant growth when applied as 1 % inoculum in soil. 67 Taro Genetic Resources: Conservation and Utilisation 359.

Control of leaf blight disease, Phytophthora colocasiae Racib. in taro, Colocasia esculenta (L.) Journal of South Pacific Agriculture 5(1), 77-83. Phosphorous acid applied at 14 ml/litre gave excellent control of taro (Colocasia esculenta) leaf blight disease caused by P. colocasiae. The duration of control varied, mainly due to prevailing climatic conditions. Under Western Samoa conditions, this appeared to be no more than 2-4 weeks. This compared poorly with control obtained for root and heart rot diseases in pineapple (one crop cycle) caused by P. cinnamoni with a single application of phosphorous acid. It is suggested that the high rainfall and rapid growth rates oftaro may result in more rapid dilution of the fungicide. It is also suggested that it may be related to its indirect mode of action, i.e., that of stimulating host defence responses to the pathogen. Since there is an additive effect of phosphorous acid, and taro in the Pacific is believed to lack genetic resistance, the effect of the fungicide would not be as pronounced. 361. Semisi, S.

Sporulation of P. colocasiae on detached taro leaves was affected by temperature and relative humidity, with optima at 21 C and 100%. No sporulation occurred at RH lower than 90%. On washed lesions, 2-3 hours were required for sporulation to be initiated. Zoosporangia at RH lower than 90% lost viability rapidly and the percentage of indirect germination dropped significantly. This was attributed to rapid dehydration of the protoplasm. Indirect germination of zoosporangia occurred in water in less than 2 hours at the optimum temperature of 20-21 C, and zoospores germinated in less than a half hour after release. Direct germination occurred in 5-6 hour at 20-28 C. The percentage of direct germination was less than 5 at all temperatures. Epidemics of the disease occurred in the field when night temperatures and relative humidity were optimum for 6-8 hours for 3-4 consecutive days and light rains or dews prevailed in the morning. During these periods, 50% of the zoosporangia collected in the morning germinated indirectly. Zoosporangia collected at 2 pm were not viable; the phytoplasm appeared to be totally dehydrated. 405.

Unpublished. In this transcript of a presentation to the meeting, the spread of taro leaf blight into the region, with special reference to the situation in Hawaii and Micronesia, is described. Environmental factors affecting the disease and chemical control measures taken in Hawaii are outlined. Difolatan is considered to be the best fungicide. Ridomil was also effective, but copper fungicides give little control. Adequate fertilization of the crop is also considered necessary in the control strategy. In Micronesia taro varieties are disappearing. The crop is of less importance here, but taro leaf blight still limits taro production. 410. Trujillo, E. E. (1996). Taro leaf blight research in the American Pacific. ADAP Bulletin 1, 1-3. The spread of taro leaf blight in the Pacific and the effect of the disease's introduction on taro production in American Samoa and Samoa in 1993/94 is discussed. The ADAP Taro Leaf Blight Project, started in 1994 is described. Micronesian taro varieties were collected and evaluated for resistance and some were multiplied by tissue culture. Field testing of promising Palauan varieties is described. Other objectives of the project were to determine the viability of zoosporangia in soil at different moisture and temperature regimes and to determine the effect of balanced nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium nutrition on taro leaf blight incidence. Spore survival in the soil of>3 months in moist soils and <20 C is reported. Balanced fertilizer applications led to an increase in yield of taro but the effect on taro leaf blight was not significant. 411. Trujillo, E. E. (1971). Taro leaf spot.

Taro cultivars from Guam, Palau and Rota were evaluated for resistance to taro leaf blight in the field at Hakalaua, Hawaii. High levels of resistance were found among the Palaun cultivars. All the cultivars tested were significantly more resistant to taro leaf blight than Niue, the principal cultivar grown in American Samoa. Disease resistance in the majority of the Palaun cultivars appeared to be related to the highly water-repellent nature of the foliage and to a hypersensitive reaction that caused infected leaves to drop off. It is concluded that the Palaun cultivars are promising for cultivation in American Samoa. 414. Trujillo, E. E., Wall, G., Greenough, D., & Tilialo, R.

A technique for inoculation with precise numbers of fungal spores on leaves and stems of plants was developed. The technique consisted of placing 1-/11 drops with a fixed number of spores on the surface of leaves and stems, and covering each inoculum drop with a 10-/11 drop of low-temperature gelling SeaPlaque agarose to fix the inoculum on the target site. With this technique single zoospores of Phytophthora capsid were able to cause local lesions on leaves and stems of peppers (Capsicum annuum cv. California Wonder), and the size of the lesions directly correlated with the number of spores in the inoculum drops. Similar results were obtained when the technique was used to inoculate taro (Colocasia esculenta) leaves with zoospores of (Brassica nigra) leaves with Alternaria brassicae. This method has the advantages of being accurate and precise, and it is also easy to handle the inoculated plants. It may also be applicable to other pathogens. 442. Yap, T. C. (1999).

[nicotianae var.] parasitica (A 1) as a hormone receptor, no sex organs of the latter were observed in matings lasting for 7 h, but the amount of hormone produced was sufficient to stimulate the production of 341 oospores/cm2 6 days later. Max. induction of sex organs was reached in matings lasting 48 h. Hormone production was inhibited by light, but the effect of light on oospore development was small. Temperatures of 10 and 15 deg C inhibited growth of, and hormone production by, P. coiocasiae, and prevented P. nicotianae var. parasitica from forming new sex organs after stimulation by hormone. The effect of temperature on hormone and oospore formation differed. Hormone formation was poor at 30 deg, but oospore development was good. 446. Yusuf, R. (1987).

Of 280 isolates of P. colocasiae obtained from Hainan Island, China, 136 were mating type AI, 102 were type A2 and 42 were AO. The 3 mating types were all pathogenic to taro (Colocasia esculenta) leaves and had similar electrophoretic patterns of soluble proteins. The representative isolates tested showed considerable variation in growth response to temperature, in ability to produce sporangia and in morphology of sporangia. It is suggested that Hainan Island in inside the centre of origin of P. colocasiae. 452. Zheng, F. C., & Ward, E. (1998). Variation within and between Phytophthora species from rubber and citrus trees in China, determined by polymerase chain reaction using RAPDs. Journal of Phytopathology 146(2-3), 103-109. Variation among 39 isolates of Phytophthora species (P. citrophthora, P. P. capsici, P. palmivora and P. meadii, from rubber and citrus trees, and P. colocasiae from taro) was studied using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Ten randomly-chosen lO-mer primers were used. Generally, the banding patterns were similar within species and different between species, but no one primer was able to distinguish all 6 species from one another. Cluster analysis on pooled data from all the primers gave 6 groups of isolates corresponding to the 6 morphological species. The group corresponding to P. citrophthora was divided further into subgroups that were related to host species and geographical location. This work confirmed the existing morphological classification of Phytophthora isolates from rubber and citrus trees in tropical China and showed the validity of using RAPDs to study the taxonomy of Phytophthora. 82 A Bibliography of Taro LeajBlight Author Index Adams, E. 1, 2 Akus, W. 3 Alam, S. 4 Ali, M.

Some experts have even argued that the application of MAS could \"revolutionize\" the way varieties and breeding stock are developed. In a new comprehensive assessment (Marker-Assisted Selection, Rome 2007), FAG emphasizes that MAS has enormous potential but notes that the technology has not yet delivered its expected benefits to farmers in developing countries. Shivaji Pandey, Chairperson of the FAG Working Group on Biotechnology, gives his view on MAS. What is marker-assisted selection (MAS)? MAS is a biotechnology tool that could greatly accelerate conventional breeding of crops, livestock, farmed fish and trees. Scientists are using MAS to genetically improve certain characteristics or traits (productivity, disease resistance, quality etc.) that are important for farmers. MAS makes it possible to select traits with greater accuracy and to develop a new variety quicker than in the past. What is the difference between MAS and genetically modified organisms (GMOs)? MAS and genetic modification are different biotechnologies. MAS allows desirable genes to be \"marked\" or tagged so they can be selected within the breeding population, while GMOs are the result of the transfer of a desirable gene or genes from one species to another. New plant varieties or improved animal breeds resulting from MAS do not require a specific legislative framework. The complicated approval process required for GMOs does not apply for MAS -its costs of release are therefore lower. In addition, the technology is not controversial so there is no problem with public acceptance. Indeed, one of the drawbacks of the intense debate that has taken place in recent years over the benefits and risks of GMOs is that it has overshadowed the potential role that other, non-GMO, biotechnologies, such as MAS, may play for food and agriculture. What is the potential of MAS? Since MAS first became a practical reality about 20 years ago, it has now gone past the research and development stage and is being applied in the field. For example, it is currently being used in dairy cattle breeding programmes in France and Germany, and rice varieties with improved bacterial blight resistance have being developed using MAS approaches and released in India and Indonesia. However, initial enthusiasm and optimism have been tempered by the realization that it is more difficult and takes longer than originally thought before genetic improvement of traits using MAS can be realized. The considerable resources invested in this technology have been mainly concentrated in the industrialized world, and MAS has not yet delivered its expected benefits to farmers in developing countries. What are the costs associated with MAS? MAS requires quite a sophisticated infrastructure and considerable investments: including specialized equipment, electricity, laboratory design and management, data handling and statistics, and Internet connectivity. Efficient and effective application of MAS also requires well-qualified staff and good funding. It should therefore be used where there is a clear advantage over traditional selection techniques. What are the constraints countries are facing applying MAS? Apart from the investments required, a serious constraint that most countries face in applying MAS is the lack of a national policy on science and technology and on biotechnology. This is essential to provide guidance on the strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation of biotechnologies, including MAS, for food and agriculture. In addition, MAS should only be applied when well-structured breeding programmes are already in place, which is often not the case in many developing countries. How could the application of MAS contribute to hunger and poverty reduction? Most of the around 820 million hungry people in developing countries live in rural areas where people's livelihoods depend on agriculture. This means that investing in agriculture, and more broadly in rural development, must be at the heart of any strategy for hunger and poverty reduction. While the measures needed certainly go well beyond the issue of producing more food and agricultural products, achieving greater yields and higher value products from the same plot of land or enterprise, through, for example, appropriate application of technologies such as MAS, must be a key ingredient for the great majority of developing countries.

COTTON Navdanya A-60, Hauz Khas navdanya@gmail.com Website: www.navdanya.org 1 EFFECT ON SOIL BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES DUE TO CULTIVATION OF BtCOTTON A survey was conducted under Bt cotton growing areas of Vidharbha. Twenty five fields were selected where Bt cotton is growing for the last three years, which was compared with the adjoining fields where either other varieties of cotton was growing or any other crops were growing during that period. The areas covered between Nagpur, Amravati, Wardha and adjoining areas. The sampling was done in 2nd week of December during the crop harvest. The effect on microbial population was recorded as Table 5. Table 5.

No change in fungi population was noticed and there was insignificant decline (-4.1 %) in nitrifiers population. 2 A significant decline in total microbial biomass (8.9%) was also noticed due to cultivation of Bt cotton (Fig. 6). The results pointed out that Bt cotton adversely affected on some group of microorganisms, which ultimately helps in reduction to microbial biomass. 1000 900 857 ,-. \":'en 800 781 ! til 700 til cu 600 8 0 :s -; 500 :s 400 0 '\"' 1.1 300 \u00b7s ] 200 0 E-I 100 0 Non Bt Cotton plots Bt cotton plots Fig. 6.

A slight reduction in esterase (7.6%) and alkaline phosphatase (0.7%) activity was observed but the results are not statistically significant. The present results clearly demonstrated that Bt cotton cultivation definitely affect soil biological health especially beneficial microorganisms (actinomycetes, bacteria) and enzymes (acid phosphatase, nitrogenase and dehydrogenase). 4 Catholic Healthcare West Presses Suppliers to Prohibit Animal Cloning and Genetically Engineered Foods Marketwire News Releases Published: 01/06/0901:13 PM EST +C~l1c:Heal~~~st Leading Catholic Hospital System Takes Action for Sustainable Food Production SAN FRANCISCO, CA --(Marketwire) --01/06/09 --Catholic Healthcare West (CHW) announced today that its food purchasing dollars will be focused on promoting sustainable food production practices, in part by seeking alternatives to foods produced with genetically engineered sugar, as well as meat and dairy produced with animal clones. The CHW position was developed in recognition of the serious health and environmental concerns these technologies raise and the threat they pose to healthier and more sustainable food production options. Among the concerns CHW is raising about genetically engineered and cloned foods are genetic contamination, increased pesticide use, animal cruelty, and the deep ethical and moral issues associated with these untested new technologies. CHW recently asked eight of its largest food suppliers for their policies on genetically engineered sugar beets, which are being planted for commercial use for the first time this year. Results from the survey found that its suppliers would prefer non-genetically engineered sugar beets. Only Diamond Crystal indicated their intent to avoid buying genetically engineered sugar and that they will seek out suppliers that do not use genetically engineered foods through a validation process. CHW intends next to survey its meat and dairy suppliers on their potential use of animal cloning since the U.S. FDA recently decided to allow marketing of food from animal clones. \"We are working with our purchasing organization, Premier, and developing relationships with allied healthcare partners in looking for food companies that will provide us with meat and dairy products that are not from animal cloning, and foods that are made without genetically engineered sugar beets,\" stated Pat Burdullis, CHW's administrator of non-clinical supply chain contracts. \"If these same food companies can provide foods that are natural and non-genetically engineered for their European customers, we believe they should provide us with the same level of service.\" Genetic engineering and animal cloning are controversial in food production, since the technologies have not been subject to long-term safety testing and could create irreversible environmental damage. Genetically engineered crops can contaminate natural foods and have promoted the use of herbicides that may be harmful to human health and natural systems. Scientists say that animal clones are often abnormal and suffer from a host of often painful defects. A New England Journal of Medicine article stated that, \"[It] may be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to generate healthy cloned animals.\" \"Genetic engineering and animal cloning are in direct conflict with our sustainable food service vision and corporate sustainability goals,\" stated Sr. Mary Ellen Leciejewski, CHW's ecology program coordinator. \"We have numerous unanswered concerns about the imminent introduction of genetically engineered sugar beets and marketing of food from animal clones. Previous genetically engineered crops have increased pesticide use, and animal cloning is a cruel and unnecessary technology in meat and dairy production. Our aim is to promote alternative approaches that produce foods that are safer and healthier for our patients, staff, and visitors and that can sustain the farmers and food producers in our communities.\" CHW has successfully advocated with its suppliers for safer, more environmentally friendly products, most recently with regard to its PVCIDEHP-free IV products now being provided by B.Braun. With respect to food production, CHW is advocating for public policies that meet the following safeguards: Before marketing, genetically engineered food or food from animal cloning must be fully evaluated through independent, peer-review for any effects on animal welfare, human health, and the environment. Foods with genetically engineered ingredients and foods from animal cloning (including foods from the offspring of clones) must be labeled as such. Genetically engineered seeds and plants are rigidly separated from other seeds and plants so that natural foods (those produced by non\u00ad genetically modified techniques) are protected from contamination; cloned animals and their offspring must be rigorously tracked throughout the food chain. Genetic engineering patent holders are held legally liable for contamination of non-genetically engineered crops and growers are protected when their crops are contaminated by genetically engineered crops.

I 7 ~ 225 Aloha My name is Les Yee Hoy and I farm taro in Halawa Valley, Molokai. I'm testifying today as a taro farmer, farmer and concerned citizen. Taro farmer testimony: I'm involved in this anti GE movement because these biotech companies want to genetically modify Kalo, the Hawaiian staple. They get a patent on it, they own it. If I want to continue farming Kalo, I have to pay them. I find this to be unacceptable. Farmer testimony: The reasons (diseases,invasive species etc.) these biotech companies give to GM kalo, also applies to every other thing that we eat. (plant or animal). It's only a matter of time before these biotech companies try to GM all of the other crops grown in Hawaii and the world. Are you fellow farmers out there willing to payor be put out of business? Farmers beware. Your turn to deal with these companies is on the horizon. Concerned citizen testimony: I really believe that these biotech companies could some day control the world food supply. This is unacceptable. Also, the &quot;Precautionary Principle&quot; is being totally ignored. I support passage of HB1663 and any other Bill out there that will keep them in check and accountable. It's not just about taro anymore. Mahalo for allowing me to testify. Les Yee Hoy 1 Caren Diamond P. O. Box 536 Hanalei, Hi. 96714 March Testimony in Strong HD1, ENE Room: Hearing Date 225 3/19/2009 Aloha Committee Members, Please support HB 1663 HD1. Taro, is different than other crops, providing a living link to our history, and ancestors, as each huli planted reaches back in time to our ancestors and past farmers who sustained their families farming taro, caring for the land. Taro is often synonymous with Hanalei. Our verdant green valley is home to many varieties of taro. As a resident of Kauai's North Shore, our community and culture is steeped in taro, it is both historically very significant, and crucial for our future. Variety and diversity is the key to life, and in this time of high food insecurity, all taro should remain \"natural\", not modified by science. No other plant has the very same beginnings as in the past. Taro is an amazing plant, where the future and past are one. There is no reason for biotechnology to enter this sacred dance of nature. Truly, taro, in all its varieties, belong to the Hawaiian People. Why mess with a staple crop of the Hawaiian people? Each Taro plant has its history rooted with the ancestors, and it should remain that way. Both the unknown risks and unintended consequences of genetic engineering of taro are unacceptable. The loss of taro's natural genetic integrity may compromise the plants ability to naturally adapt. Biodiversity is the key to plant life and Hawaii's agriculture, necessary for our sustainability into the future . If researchers insert genes from corn, wheat, rice and other organisms, you don't know what is in it and it's not taro anymore. The genetic manipulation of taro is undesirable and unnecessary. There are many traditional means of building good soil health and improving crop quality that should be utilized, rather than the use of genetic manipulation of such an important staple to the people of Hawaii. Please support this important bill. Its necessary to include all varieties of taro to achieve taro protection and purity. Mahalo for your support, Caren Diamond Subject: For HB 1663 HD1 Honorable Chair Senator Mike Gabbard, Thank you for this opportunity to testify for HB 1663 HD1 as amended. I respectfully ask you and your committee members to pass HB 1663 HD1 to prohibit genetic engineering of Hawaiian taro varieties only. This bill is a good compromise that respects the cultural beliefs of native Hawaiians while allowing needed research using all available technologies to improve disease resistance of non-native taro varieties. Deadly diseases in the South Pacific could wipe out taro production in Hawaii if they ever reach our islands. Scientists should be allowed to conduct pro-active research to improve disease resistance on non-Hawaiian taro varieties using all available technologies, before a crisis situation exists. Accidental introduction of the Alomae-Bobone Viral complex wiped out taro production in Makira Island in the Solomon Islands. All Hawaiian taro varieties are susceptible to the Alomae-Bobone Viral complex. The Kauai Taro Grower's Association (largest commercial taro growing organization in Hawaii) has come out strongly in support of research to improve taro production using all available technologies for non-Hawaiian taro varieties. Please support taro farmers by voting for HB 1663 HD 1. Please do NOT amend it to prohibit genetic engineering research on all taro varieties.

Kalani English, Vice Chair SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENERY & ENVIRONMENT Support ofHB 1663, relating to Genetically Modified Plant Organisms Room: 225 Hearing Date: Thursday, March 19th Time: 3:45 PM Position: Support Dear Senator Gabbard, My name is Laurie Goodwin, I live in Kekaha on the island ofKauai and I support the passage ofHB 1663. I respect the spiritual and cultural significance oftaro to native Hawaiians and I feel that this bill adequately addresses those concerns. It is possible that in the future Hawaii could face a disease or insect pest that would destroy the taro production we have left in the State. If we limit the tools we can use to fight future diseases and pests we may regret it later. This bill still allows research to be done on non-Hawaiian varieties and allows others worldwide to seek out the expertise of Hawaii's researchers. I respectfully ask that you pass this bill out of your committee in its present form and honor the compromise offered by the House. Thank you for this opportunity to testify. La\u00abJtie ~ P.O. Box [AG/2111] [gerald.m.dill.jr@monsanto.com] Wednesday, March 18, 2009 9:32 AM ENETestimony Support of HB 1663 HD 1 I am writing to voice support of HB 1663 HD 1 at the Committee on Energy and Environment hearings this Wednesday, March 18, 2009 at 3:45PM. This bill respects the cultural and historical significance of Taro to the Hawaiian people and allows critical research to continue. The tools and knowledge developed by such research will benefit Hawaiian growers as well as international Taro growers in searching for ways to keep the species a viable agricultural commodity. Our president, Mr. Obama, recently lifted the ban on stem cell research under the reasoning that research is critical to our success in curing genetic diseases. Likewise, allowing research on Taro to continue will develop the diagnostic tools and knowledge that will aid in selection of traits and varieties that are more resistant to pests and diseases and that can this crop can be grown more reliably for many years to come. House bill HB 1663 HD 1 is an excellent compromise that will allow scientific advancement while respecting the spiritual and cultural significance oftaro to native Hawaiians. Please honor the compromise offered by this bill and pass it lias is\".

HB 1663 HD 1 is a fair and equitable compromise that allows for genetic research in enclosed structures on non-Hawaiian taro while still respecting the spiritual and cultural significance of taro to native Hawaiians. The continuance of taro research is a must for the state of Hawaii to ensure that advancements in technology are made in case taro production is negatively impacted by disease or pests such as what happened in the Soloman Islands, Samoa, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. I applaud the members of the house for coming up with this compromise that builds a bridge between the cultural and scientific issues surrounding taro while not imposing outright bans that are sought after by activists who are blatantly and wrongly using the cultural significance of taro to advance their anti-gmo rhetoric.

This bill recognizes and respects the cultural and spiritual significance of Hawaiian taro to the Native Hawaiian community. HB 1663 HD 1 makes it clear that this is not a referendum on biotechnology. This bill allows researchers in Hawaii to pursue innovations that may enable biotechnology to be a valuable tool in addressing the agronomic challenges that have decimated taro production elsewhere .. The bill ensures that the extreme anti-GMO agenda of a vocal minority is not furthered by banning research on all taro varities. Thank you for your time and consideration. Aloha and Mahalo, Michael Nagel Waipahu, Oahu 1 As a horticulturist, I see both the beauty of plants and their importance as food to feed a rapidly growing world population. I am constantly amazed at the diversity within the plant world, and the unique ecosystems, especially on the islands in Hawaii. I understand the cultural importance and sacred traditions that taro has had in Hawaiian history. I respect the past, and believe that it should be remembered and honored. But, I also realize that the world is changing, and human populations are increasing at a staggering rate. This increase in world population requires agriculture to be more efficient and more productive on less land. Farmers must be able to harvest more from each acre of land than in the past, and the plants that they grow must be genetically superior to meet this demand, whether it is by natural selection, or by scientific methods. I have worked in many sectors of the horticulture industry. Most relevant to this issue, I spent many years growing numerous food crops for sale directly to the general public. From talking to my customers, most people are concerned about where their food originates, and what has been done to it along the way before it gets to their plate. I share their concerns, and I am very supportive of using integrated pest management methods as a farmer's first step in pest control. I believe there are many cultural methods that farmers can take as a first step to minimize the use of pesticides, genetic modifications, and energy usage during production. But I also realize that there are pests that can be devastating to a crop if there are no controls available. Plants have genetically changed throughout history and that is the beauty of natural diversity. But nature cannot keep up with such a rapid increase in human population on its own. We have altered nature so drastically in so many areas of the world that we must take extra measures to try keep up with growing demands of the world. That is why I believe that there should be GMO testing allowed for research purposes on taro. I believe there needs to be alternatives for future taro farmers if a devastating disease or insect outbreak occurs. I support GMO testing on taro by universities and responsible industries, as needed, to develop disease and insect resistant varieties that will sustain a growing human population in the future. The technology that is available is amazing, and the people who work within the biotechnology industry have dedicated their lives to perfecting this science. The researchers and other supporting members in this field could have chosen a different career path to focus their energies on, but they have chosen to dedicate their time and energy on reducing pesticide usage, increasing crop yields, and helping feed the world population. I know many people within the industry who have strong views on both ends ofthe genetically modified organism debate. I am still moderate in my views, but I tend to lean towards genetic modification after all other avenues have been explored. I know that genetic modification is not the complete answer by itself. But it is an integral part of the solution to feeding the growing world population. The technology is there to be used in a positive way, and we should not turn our backs on it, or burn those bridges that we may need in the future. Sincerely, Roxanne Nagel From: Sent: Testimony for 225 allow genetic engineering to occur on non-Hawaiian taro varieties, in the safety of the lab at UH. It would be short sighted not to allow this scientific research before some of the taro viruses come to Hawaii. 1 Thomas T Shirai Jr PO Box 601 Waialua, HI 96791 Email: Kawaihapai@hawaii.rr.com Senate Committee on Energy & Environment (ENE) Senator Mike Gabbard (Chair) /Senator J Kalani English (Vice Chair) Notice of Hearing Thursday, March 19, 2009 3:45 PM / State Capitol Conference Room 225 March 18, 2009, 2009 RE: Testimony Supporting HB 1663 H01 (Relating to Taro Security) Aloha Chair Gabbard, Vice Chair English & Committee Members, I Support HB 1663 HOl.

Limiting HB 1663 to only Hawaiian varieties does not protect the Hawaiian varieties from the potential of either hybridization or crop plant mixing through huli exchange; and therefore, neither protects Hawaiian taro varieties nor solves the problems oftaro farmers in Hawaii. In regards to importance of the original language ofHB1663, I submit the following, as well as the attached matrix of issues related to the potential impacts that a release of genetically engineered taro might have on taro farmers in the state: Taro farmers have been coming out of the lo'i and traveling to the legislature for three years to lay this threat to their crop, their food, their livelihood and their culture to rest. Last year, over 7,000 people testified in support of similar legislation including taro farmers, Hawaiians, three County Councils, consumers, organic farmers, scientists, health practitioners and specialists, and other supporters from across the state. In November 2008, the County of Hawai'i passed an ordinance banning the genetic engineering of taro. As a taro farmer with a background in science and biodiversity conservation, I have weighed the benefits and risks of genetically engineered taro carefully and found it to be too great a risk to the integrity of the plant as a traditional food crop, the environment, taro biodiversity, fragile taro markets, and consumer health. It is also inappropriate in the context of the significance of taro in Hawaiian culture. For every proposed benefit, there are serious questions that remain in the highest standards of the science regarding the safety of transgenic crops for human consumption and the natural environment, as well as its true productivity and economic impact. The National Academy of Science, the highest regarded scientific organization in the US, along with the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development [IAASTD] project, the UNlFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) support this conclusion. In 2008, IAASTD produced a rigorous 2,500 page report after a four year study involving more than 400 scientists worldwide which concluded that organic agriculture, greater biodiversity within smaller contiguous fields, and improving access to markets would have a far greater impact than GE crops towards shifting world hunger and reducing crop disease. The study was supported by more than 30 governments and 30 global funders, including the US, England, other European nations, the World Bank, UNIFAO, WHO and the biotech industry, who recently pulled out of the project because they did not agree with the recommendations of the report. The State of California, recognizing the uncontrollable persistence and irreversibility of gmo plants that hybridize non-gmo crops or escape into adjacent fields (whether they hybridize or not), passed into law this year landmark legislation (AB541) protecting farmers from crippling lawsuits by the biotech industry over cross-contamination. The companies do not compensate farmers for contaminating their fields even when organic certification is destroyed; rather, they consider cross-pollination or escape into other farmers' fields which can occur by wind, birds or insects to be theft of property rights. This says a great deal about who these companies really are and where their concerns lay. But more important for taro in Hawai'i are three clear facts; First, there are many problems that face taro that cannot be resolved by genetically modifying the plant. I have spent the last six years documenting the impacts and researching solutions with taro farmers to control the invasive apple snail, which is responsible for the highest percentage of crop and huli loss annually (Levin for DLNR-DAR, 2006; Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service, multiple years). The apple snail is a major vector for other diseases that attack the taro; its razor sharp mouth creates a wound through which fungi and parasites can enter the corm, setting the stage for many forms of root rot. We know from experience and observation that solving the apple snail problem; improving soil organics, fallow durations and cultivar diversity; and restoring water to lo'i kalo will significantly reduce pests and disease occurrence and increase crop productivity. Removing the apple snails alone will eliminate an 18-25% crop loss and increase the available time a farmer has to care for his farm and his family by 50%. Proposed yield increases and disease resistance for GMO taro are hypothetical and untested; the apple snail will eat it anyway. There is no need or demand to grow GMO taro from local taro farmers or consumers. Indeed, even those few farmers who support continued gmo taro research, will not plant it in their fields. Better and safer options exist. The genetically engineered taro has been developed using a variety called Bunlong, also known as Chinese, along with portions of wheat, rice and grapevine DNA. This variety has been used by taro farmers for more than 150 years in Hawaii -as a leaf crop and dry land table taro. It lacks the qualities of a good poi taro. It is used today mostly for the chip industry where tissue culture for clean planting material, good site selection, mulching and spacing practices significantly reduce disease. Poi millers use primarily Lehua and Moi, both Hawaiian varieties. A genetically engineered Bunlong taro does nothing to improve disease resistance or production for poi taro farmers. Millers will not buy it and consumers will not eat it (UH CTAHR survey 2008). Second, taro will survive without genetic engineering long into the future if we attend to the sources of the problem. Taro is one of the oldest human-managed food crops in the world; its use dates back more than 50,000 years by some accounts, but it's regular cultivation can be documented to 7,000 -10,000 years ago in South and Southeast Asia. For an estimated 1,200 years, taro in Hawai'i has survived volcanic fallout, floods, droughts, pests and disease. The presence of the word, kakane (a leaf blight on plants) in the Hawaiian language illustrates that taro leaf blight has been around a very long time. Agricultural records show that several taro disease events occurred from the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s; but, this was not the primary reason for the decline of taro in Hawai' i as some would suggest. Only since the apple snail reached critical destructive mass (1990s), has the confluence of lack of cold water and poor soil quality created a corresponding persistence in disease occurrence in taro. A close look at data presented by HASS (2001) and UH CTAHR Cooperative Extension Services (Feb 2007) actually supports this understanding. By the 1900s, many Hawaiians had lost access to both land and water. Many others died from disease, taking with them the knowledge of best growing practices and the taro varieties. In the 1930s, Chinese and Japanese farmers dominated commercial cultivation of taro, changing planting, mulching and fallow practices and cycles. Part of the decline in taro production can be attributed to changes in the market and in society. The demand for poi during the war declined significantly. A new era after WWII saw farming families urging their children to become doctors, lawyers and teachers rather than farmers; by the 1950s many people, including Hawaiians, preferred rice to poi. At the same time, farmers shifted away from organic mulching methods to chemical fertilizer applications initiating a long, slow decline in soil quality that persists today. The number of natural disasters during that same period severely impacted the productivity oftaro-growing lands. Of the 50 tsunamis reported in Hawaii since the 1800s, seven inflicted major damage. The tsunamis of 1868, 1946, 1960 and 1975 and the hurricanes of 1940, 1957, 1959, 1982, 1986 and 1992 wiped out significant portions of low-lying taro lands, including those of SOEST records). Major flooding events also took their toll, including in 1956, 1970, 1974- 75,1978-79,1980-1983,1987-88,1991-92,1999-2000,2004 and the rains of Feb-March, 2006 that devastated Kauai growers fields (USGS; greater than 1 O,OOOfe /sec). It takes an average two years to recover from such events; sometimes longer. Archival records dating back to the early 1800s indicate it was attention to the soil and the water that kept the taro robust. Queen Emma herself grew taro whose corms averaged 22in. long and 22in. around and documented the careful management of the soil and plants by which she achieved this standard; something very few taro farmers still practice. She writes; \"the size of the roots depend upon the depth of loose soil, and the care bestowed on its cultivation. I have produced kalo which averaged twenty-two inches in length and the same in circumference when it was cultivated under my own eye, but far less in the same locality when the cultivation was somewhat neglected by my konohiki\" (HEN Vol. Arch. Collection, pp 76-83; undated manuscript, Bishop Museum; Queen Emma collection 71, nd, pg8). Third, protecting the biodiversity of taro is critical to future survival, food and economic security. Hawai'i retains many of the ancient Hawaiian taro varieties, some of which are extremely rare, along with extensive ex-situ collections of taro from throughout the Pacific, and Asia. A ban on genetically engineered taro in Hawai'i provides a buffer of protection not just from cross-pollination but more importantly from simply the inability to visually distinguish between a gmo taro and a non-gmo taro in the field. The ban would protect not just the Hawaiian varieties, but all taro cultivars found in the state, an important resource for continuing to build leaf blight resistance using conventional hand-pollination techniques -or restoring traditional varieties back to their original islands throughout the region. What we are asking for is a return to ethics in agriculture in Hawai'i -one where the researchers, institutions, agencies and industries who say they wish to help farmers are actually engaged in what farmers really need and ask for, rather than the pursuit of patents; where researchers also understand and take responsibility for the risks and burdens they place on us and our markets when they follow a path of their own making. The State of Hawai' i made a commitment to taro by designating it as the State Plant and by establishing the Taro Security and Purity Task Force to address non-gmo issues for farmers in 2008. I urge the members of the Committee on Energy and Environment to further this commitment by passing in full support HB 1663 in its orginallanguage. Mahalo nui loa.

Bt toxin may also cause perforation of blood cells. [Gutierrez, D. 4/10107].

Genetically engineered crops Conventional hybrids take few years to develop, as in the case of Samoan taro hybrids less time to develop than counter leaf blight epidemics in the 1990s. They do not need permits from the FDA or conventional hybrids and produce EPA to move from the lab to the nursery, to field tests, to farms and tables.

These results compound concerns about the ecological impacts ofBt com raised by previous studies showing com-grown toxins harm beneficial insects living in the soil. This may have serious consequences for nearshore reefs in Hawaii. If crops are able to breed with wild relatives, the new genes will be spread to those wild plants.

President- West Kauai Taro Farmers Co-op. Member- State Task Force on Taro Security and Purity Kanaka Maoli I am a descendant of the Makuaole family, from Makaweli Valley, formerly known as Olokele Valley. Our family has a history of growing kalo in this area that can be traced back to pre\u00ad western contact. Unlike many Kanaka Maoli families, who were disposessed from their kuleana lands, we have managed to hold on to our land, and continue to this day, to plant kalo, and to care for the very same aina that our ancestors cared for. We, as Kanaka Maoli, are direct descendants of Halo a, and Kalo. We, as the indigenous people of this land, have had our lands stolen illegally, have been made to be second class citizens in our own land, and now are being attacked at the very essence of our spirit. Would we think of going to Japan or China, or any other country, and tell those people that we want to Genetically Modify their ancestors? Would the people of those countries allow that? I don't think so. But that is exactly what they are trying to do to us. This is no longer just a taro farmer issue. This is a Kanaka Maoli issue. The Kanaka Maoli were conservationists. They practiced sustainability. They understood that what we do today will directly affect the generations to come. That is why they practiced kapu sytem, to guarantee the sustainability of their resources. They took only what they needed to sustain themselves, and left the rest to restore and replenish that resource. By doing that, they guaranteed their own survival and existence into the future. As a commercial taro farmer for the past 30+ years, and as a poi miller for 15 yrs., I understand the economics of taro and poi production. I have seen the results of leaf blight and pocket rot, and the devastation caused by apple snails. I have seen poor quality soil and taro, resulting in decreasing yields of both taro and poi. But at the same time, I have also seen beautiful, solid taro, with no pocket rot. I have seen promising results with some hybrid taro, with old Hawaiian varieties, and with wild varieties taken from the mountains ofKauai. I know from my own experience that we can grow strong, healthy taro without genetically modifying it. GMO taro is not the answer to our problems. There are other scientific methods to develop disease resistant varieties. We as farmers, need to rotate and fallow our patches, and take the time to replenish the soil organically. If the soil is healthy, the taro will grow healthy and high yields. PDF processed with CutePDF evaluation edition www.CutePDF.com But this is the problem. Large commercial farmers only grow one variety of taro and do not fallow their patches. They do not take the time to rest and replenish the land. They have kept on planting large areas just to force profits, but now they are getting more disease, snails and lower yields. There are those that think that a GMO taro is the answer to their problems, so that they can continue high intensive, mono-cropping practices, which are unsustainable into the future. Allowing GMO taro to be produced would be the beginning of the end of the taro industry. Plus, the apple snail can still eat 50% of a GMO taro. Get rid of the apple snail and production will increase by 50%. Think about it. No one knows what the future will bring, but I hope that we can learn from the practices of our ancestors. We Hawaiians, farmers and non-farmers, know what is pono in our hearts. It is not a future based on GMOs. It is a future based on sustainability and conservation. We need to put a kapu on GMOs. We humbly ask you to support the ban on GMO research on kalo.

Our taro production is included in the 70-80% of the state's taro supply that Kauai produces. We also are the farmer's that have lasted through the generations and generations, and continue to produce taro against great odds, because we are the living Hawaiian culture. We continue to plant taro because it is who we are, and it is a legacy that has been passed on to us by our kupuna. Our members are mostly small commercial taro farmers. Our taro production mostly goes to supply the poi market on Kauai. While we are considered commercial farmers, one thing that we have in common is that we don't farm taro for just the money. My uncle and mentor, Barnie Char, used to say, \"You cannot grow taro for just the money. It has to come from in you. You have to love to do it.\" While we might represent a smaller proportion of the Kauai's taro production than the larger commercial farmers, we are no less important. There are many other small taro farmers throughout the state, who oppose any kind of GMO research, on any kind of taro. The West Kauai Taro Farmer's Co\u00ad op. supports the ban on GMO Kalo. Please Kokua, John Keikiala Aana Aloha Representatives, Testimony in Support ofHB1663 Chris Kobayashi Fulltime Organic Taro Farmer Hanalei, Kauai I am in strong support ofHB1663, Ban on GMO taro in Hawaii. My parents and grandparents farmed taro since the early 1940's. I grew up surrounded by taro fields. I attended the University of Hawaii and got a B.S. in Agriculture. I didn't know at the time that I would be the one to take over the farm after my dad retired. If my dad was here today, he would say that we need to protect and take care of the taro. He was the one who taught me how to select for the best huli (vegetative propagative piece) for the next planting. Sometime in the '60s and '70s, there was this \"disease\" called Guava Seed. Not even the CTAHR researchers knew the cause of it. There seemed to be no cure. My dad, in his wisdom, felt strongly that selection of huli played a huge part in eliminating that \"disease\". Today, it is rare to see Guava Seed in our plantings. Selection ofhuli means being observant of the plants and of their many good and desirable qualities in the field as they respond to the seasons and other environmental factors. This is what all the Kanaka Maoli Kahu 0 Haloa who came before all of us did. It is through their astute observations and abilities to select and breed that we have the different Hawaiian varieties today. Through observation, it seems that the production and quality of taro started to decline rapidly in the late 1980's and early 1990's. To me, it was similar to the stock market crash. I think. But in our case, it was the Soil Fertility Crash. I spoke to an agronomist at UH but he didn't seem to agree with me. I believe we had different perspectives of what a healthy soil is. If one looks at how commercial taro is being farmed today, one will see that the field barely has time to rest and fallow or grow a rotational crop in between, before taro is once again planted in the same field. If there is disease present, continuous planting will just increase the disease presence. We must break the disease cycle. Change the environment so that the beneficial microorganisms can mUltiply. There are many many applications that we can try in growing taro. Most are not new. They are simply being rediscovered. Our ancient elders and kupuna knew of them. Farmers who are in touch with the natural cycle of the earth know of these secrets to growing healthy and nutrient dense food. GMO taro will not save taro or our commercial farmers. Making the taro resistant to one disease may make it vulnerable to another. Farmers who say that they will not plant or eat the GMO taro but want the research to continue just in case, will end up planting it because if they continue to farm with out regard for true soil fertility, their crops will not be healthy and prone to disease and they will think that they have arrived at that 'just in case\" time. My point is that, we need to provide a healthy environment for the taro. Just like us human beings. When the flu is going around, not everyone gets it. Why? Because of what we feed ourselves that help to boost our immune systems. Likewise, the ones who get sick probably have some kind of stress on their bodies. So simple. Let's not unleash a GE live organism that we could never recall if it is later determined that they cause harm. Also, I don't believe that there are enough regulations to keep this kind of experiment in the lab or greenhouse. Who will be liable? Dr. Susan Miyasaka? UH? HARC? The lab assistants? DOA? USDA? The farmer who plants it? With the demand for organic food growing, will consumers want to buy and eat GMO taro or poi? Would you feed it to your baby? Or your elderly parent? As a farmer, I know that taro varieties can and will get easily mixed up besides getting crosspollinated naturally or purposely. And gmo taro? That's on a microscopic level and we'd definitely not be able to see the difference. What about the farmer who chooses to grow non gmo taro? What about the consumer who hopes that the organic or non gmo taro really is non gmo taro? Please help to support keeping taro pure; keeping its nutritional and medicinal qualities intact; it's genetic integrity pure. Mahalo nui, Chris Kobayashi, Kalo farmer Wai'oli, Hanalei, Kaua'i Testimony of Chris Kobayashi- Organic Taro Farmer In Support of Ban on GMO-Taro Aloha mai kakou, We want a ban on GMO-taro for all varieties of taro in Hawaii. Contamination is forever. Coexistence is impossible. There are those who say they simply want the research to continue just in case. And they also claim they would never plant it. Do you really believe that? Do you think that this research and technology would stay \"safely\" in the lab? For the safety of all of us who kanu taro, who cherish it as a family member because it provides and feeds us, for our aina -the land and water-which supports the growing of our food. It is time to stop and think what we are doing to all that is real and all that matters to us as human beings on this planet. Money and the drive to own and control does not make for anything healthy. Malama Haloa. Malama kalo. Malama 'aina. One earth, one land, air, one people.

I join communities across Hawaii in rejecting the genetic modification of all taro varieties, by supporting a ban on GMO-taro. I understand that as decision makers you will be lobbied by the very powerful biotech industry and I remind you that you have been elected to represent us-the people, who are busy with all the responsibilities and necessities of daily living. We are not paid to lobby. We have entrusted you, our elected officials to make wise and practical decisions on our behalf and to protect us. We need protection from GMO foods. GMO technology is unnatural. It involves the forcing together of genes from plants, animals, viruses, pesticides, etc. to create an organism that is unnatural. Then this unnatural genetically modified organism (GMO), which is alive, is set lose in the natural world. It has not been thoroughly tested for its safety (unlike GMO medicines). This is not safe science. This is not operating on the \"precautionary principle\", which is the foundation of safe science, and this is why we need protection from GMOs. We are at risk here because these unnatural, scientifically unsafe GMOs are fed to us. They are fed to us as feed for the animals we eat or directly to us in the food we buy in the stores. It is fed to us unlabeled. If GMO foods are safe as the industry tells they are it makes sense that they would totally support the labeling of their products. The opposite is true. The GMO industry has spent millions of dollars fighting every attempt to have their products labeled. They don't want GMO foods labeled. They don't want any responsibiHty for the effects their unnatural, poorly tested scientifically unsafe GMO foods will have on us. That is why we need protection from the GMO food industry. That is why at this time we need a ban on GMO taro. Mahalo nui loa to all you legislators who are making wise and practical decisions on our behalf and protecting us. We really appreciate and honor your service. This is a kakou thing-we are striving together to keep our home, our food safe and well. Please educate yourselves about the GMO issues. Please watch the DVDs \"The Future of Food\" and \"Islands at Risk\". I will be happy to get you copies. My contact information is below. There are many other important reasons to reject the genetic modification of taro and support the ban on GMO taro. They include: The cultural significance of kalo/taro Real and imagined threats to taro growing and the industry Patenting and ownership of GMO crops Lawsuits against farmers whose crops are contaminated by GMO Public education about GMO The real beneficiaries of GMO I am happy to get you information on any of the above issues or come and discuss them with you and/or your staff. Ho' opiha kau 'eke poi i ka manawa poi bowl be always full, Vince Kana' i Dodge RE: TESTIMONY- IN SUPPORT for Ban on GMO-taro Ban research and planting of GM taro in Hawaii Dear Members of the State Legislature: I write this testimony in strong support of bills HB1663 and SB709-SDl, which would ban the research and field planting of genetically modified (GM) taro in Hawaii I have worked as a UH-Manoa Professor and Crop Production Specialist for 18 years, but write this on a personal capacity. My research is in the area of sustainable and ecological agriculture. As someone who supports sustainable agriculture, I have become increasingly concerned about the unregulated open-field plantings of GM crops in Hawaii. In general I have concerns about the health risks, about environmental risks, and also about the long-term cultural and socioeconomic impacts on our communities. Below I summarize my key positions: 1. Lack of data showing the safety of GM crops. Statements made by GM proponents are not backed by scientific, peer-reviewed data. No studies have been conducted in Hawaii or elsewhere to evaluate the short-or long-term effects on humans from having consumed GM crops over the past 12 years. 2. Lack of oversight/regulations. GM crops are poorly regulated or even deregulated. Our federal courts and internal USDA and FDA reports have found that our regulatory agencies are often incapable of detecting potential side-effects from the consumption or planting of GM crops. 3. Unintended Consequences (see references below). Recent findings in the scientific literature have shown that GM crops do indeed pose potential health risks, environmental risks, and that the benefits to farmers have not always been matched with the promises made by GM proponents. a. A comprehensive literature review published this month in a scientific journal documents a large number of potential health side effects from the few animal feeding studies that have been conducted to date (Dona and Arvanitoyannis, 2009). b. A recent refereed publication showed that the commercial planting of GM cotton was NOT more profitable than that of conventional varieties (Post et al. 2008). Similarly, several publications have shown that the yields of GM crops are similar or lower than that of conventional crops. c. A recent publication from Spain showed that contamination was inevitable and that the principle of co-existence was not working in that country (Binimelis, 2008). Contamination has occurred in all regions where GM crops have been planted. GM com contamination has been documented in several states of Mexico, even though there is a ban on GM plantings in that country. d. There are still many unknowns about potential environmental risks. For instance the toxic Bt from GM crops was found to affect non-target organisms in nearby aquatic habitats (Harwood et al. 2005; Rosi-Marshall, 2008). Also, antibiotic genes from Bt crops were found to transfer to microbes in nearby aquatic habitats and aquifers (Koike et al 2007). As another example the Bt toxin from GM com was found to affect the growth of earthworms in the soil (Zwalhen, 2003). 4. GM taro is not the answer for Hawaii. My overall assessment is that GM taro is not the answer for farmers in Hawaii, and that GM taro would not contribute toward our self-sufficiency and sustainability. The only plant disease epidemiologist at UH-Manoa concurs, having stated that we already have all of the tools at our disposal to manage the major pests and diseases in taro-by following traditional pest control strategies.

SUPPORT Ban of Genetically Modified Taro (HB1663 & SB709-SDl) Aloha Honorable Legislators, For over 1200 years farmers in Hawai'i have cared for and have protected the most extensive collection of varieties of taro on the planet. In Hawai'i, taro is the plant of the people-it is our living culture and ancient history, native nutrition and ecological tradition. Taro provides a beloved and unique hypoallergenic food, medicine, sustainable agriculture, and industry for Hawai'i. Genetically modifying any variety of kalo (taro) is culturally disrespectful and also poses irreversible and irresponsible dangers to our food, health, environment and economy. Native planters ofthe wei kahiko (old days) were proficient in managing over 300 varieties of kalo tailored for different uses, these varieties were acquired through natural propagation and farming. From these kupuna (ancestors and elders) we have been fortunate to receive their 'ike (knowledge) and live a lifestyle that is perpetuated with planting kalo, researchers and corporations are willing to disrespect this tradition that has been working of many generations. Each variety has qualities suited for different environments and uses, therefore satisfying sustainability and longevity. Other work around the world with genetically engineered crops have unfolded inevitable risks, such as elimination of diverse crops, and risk of famine due to catastrophic loss of crops that are the sole surviving species. These unknown risks are alarming, and at the same time ownership of the only surviving variety of kalo will result in a monopolized control of our most valuable source of the Hawaiian culture. I support sustainable farming & precautionary scientific research that does not expose the taro species to the disrespect and risks of genetic engineering. I ask that the lawmakers actively support farmers/scientists in publicly accepted and safely advanced methods of protecting kalo by addressing land & water issues and controlling invasive pests & diseases. I also ask that the legislators pursue other avenues such as more public lands to grow kalo and more access to the water for growing kalo. I also ask the legislators to really find the truth behind the research in genetically modified organisms (GMO) of kalo, do they really want to help the farmers, or are there other reasons, what's at stake for these entities, do they enjoy eating poi? Do they have fame and money as their number one priority? Certain entities that are focused on pursuing genetically modification of kalo have given reasons that resemble scare tactics, they seem to know what the kalo planter needs, even though they aren't the taro farmers in the fields who really understand the real situation. They claim that they can combat the apple snail, the number one reason for crop yield declines, are their GMO varieties made of plastic or are they going to be toxic? I don't see how they can create a variety that will combat this invasive pest that was introduced by people who had a \"bright idea\" to help Hawai'i, how many times has this happened and been catastrophic? Are they willing to give up their royalties and patents of ownership of our living ancestor, because they \"really\" want to help the kala industry and the people who enjoy the poi? Because of the resistance encountered from many people and organizations in recent years, GMO proponents are no longer wishing to genetically modify Hawaiian varieties, now they pursue other non\u00ad Hawaiian varieties. As scholars, I would think they know the origin for all taro, which came with the voyagers from the same place, what makes the Hawaiian varieties different from the others? More importantly, if allowed to genetically modify the non-Hawaiian varieties here in Hawai'i, where are they going to plant these synthetic varieties, here in this aina (land & environment), of Hawai'i? This wouldn't be pana (proper) and would be very disrespectful to contaminate this aina, and to also be deceptive about their intentions while carrying this out! Kala is an incomparably sacred and valuable part of our island community. We join mahi'ai (farmers) ofHawai'i in calling on you and your fellow legislators to protect all of us and Hawai'i's unique culture and resources by passing a law to provide a ban on the genetic modification and patenting oftaro. As faculty and staff who teach the Hawaiian culture and the importance of the' Gina which is the source of the culture, how should I explain to my students that the Hawaiian culture is not respected by Hawai'i's government? How do I tell them that the very foundation of Hawai'i's heritage is being altered by greedy and irresponsible scientific research? In conclusion, please consider my plea for Hawai'i to preserve our heritage and the integrity of the kala plant. I am in favor of banning research and growing ofGMO taro. Malama Pono, Me ka ha'aha'a (with Luke University of Hawai'i at Manoa Kamakakuokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies, Honolulu Community College & Ka Papa Lo'i 0 Kanewai 2645 Dole Street Honolulu, Hawai'i 96822 Mark S. Alapaki Luke (kalo planter in Kahana Valley) In Support of Ban on GMO-Taro Aloha mai kakou, I join communities across Hawaii in rejecting the genetic modification of all taro varieties, by supporting a ban on GMO-taro. I am deeply concerned about the unknown health risks, irreversible threats to native ecosystems, cultural disrespect, patenting and bioprospecting of Hawaii's natural resources and potential harms to our local farming economy that are associated with GMO-taro. -Taro Deserves the Best Available Science- GMO-taro is claimed to potentially reduce one type of taro disease in one variety of taro by creating irreversible, unnatural genetic mutations whose safety to consumers and the environment is not scientifically proven. GMO-taro has no proven benefits to taro farmers or consumers and is not the best available science needed to safely perpetuate taro farming and protect consumers in Hawaii. Better and safer options exist. Long-term scientific studies and farming practices throughout the Pacific have resulted in proven scientific techniques to expand the local taro industry, protect unique Hawaiian taro varieties, farmlands and watersheds-- without GMOs. These community-accepted practices include: organically improving soil health, establishing appropriate water-flow standards to prevent disease and pests, stopping imports of diseased taro and pests into Hawaii, and growing many traditional varieties of natural taro with different natural disease resistance. Being that safer science exists, there is no need or demand for experimental GMO-taro from local taro farmers or consumers. -Health and Environmental Safety Concerns about GMO-Taro- Taro is a nutritious food crop, especially cherished as a baby food and staple dish in Hawaii for centuries; and around the world as an important medicinal food for diabetes, cancer, autism and serious food allergies. Taro is the worlds only hypo-allergenic, or allergy-free, carbohydrate. GMO-taro, on the other hand, is not the same as natural taro. GMO-taro has never been in the human food supply before, and has NOT been scientifically tested on humans to prove that it is safe to eat. Moreover, the unnatural genetic mutations of GMO\u00ad taro can never be guaranteed to be hypo-allergenic, thus threatening consumers of this uniquely important medicinal food source. In fact, numerous scientific studies on laboratory animals show that GMOs can cause toxic, allergic, and even deadly reactions. Unnatural gene mutations introduced through GMO-taro may harm insects, birds, fish, and soil health. Risks and damages to Hawaii's people and lands could be irreversible. -Community and Ethical Concerns about GMO-Taro- Cultivated throughout centuries to be abundantly grown on Hawaii's diverse agricultural lands, taro is the sacred foundation of our unique local agriculture, society, traditions and family structure. Genetic modification of taro is an affront to the sacred Hawaiian tradition that respects the taro plant as a family member, an older brother to humanity. This family tradition is rooted in honoring the relationship of mankind with the very plants we depend on for healthy nourishment, and establishes an unique genealogical connection between taro and the Hawaiian people. The wisdom of such healthy community values must be encouraged, not disrespected or desecrated. Despite the unique and utmost importance of this plant to our community, GMO-taro has been developed without any informed community consent, raising serious ethical science concerns. Businesses and researchers in Hawaii should encourage informed community consent and review, not avoid oversight and involvement from the very communities most effected by their activities. -Economic and Bioprospecting Concerns about GMO-Taro- The right to grow taro naturally and traditionally belongs to the public, and should never be owned by a corporation or university. Private patents and control of our public food resources would cripple our food security, taro economy and violate our inherent public rights. GMO-taro experiments and patents cannot help taro farmers with the real problems that they face and will only endanger the valuable traditional biodiversity of taro in Hawaii. -Legal and Governance Concerns about Preemption Legislation- In \"exchange\" for a ban on GMO-taro, the biotechjGMO industry may attempt to turn our community's intentions to protect taro into unfair \"preemption\" legislation which would prohibit state or county oversight, and public notice of all other GMOs and biotech activities in Hawaii. We do not support any such attempts to preempt legitimate local government regulations to protect public health. Preempting local efforts to protect public health raises serious legal, ethical, and scientific concerns-- our public and environmental safety, as well as our local-governance authority, must be prioritized over private investment concerns and high-risk experiments. -Help Taro, Don't Hurt Taro!- Agricultural science has proven that the taro will be as healthy as the land in which it is grown and the care with which it is shown. There is no actual need to permanently change the taro plant's natural genetic structure nor patent the plant for private profit in order to protect the local taro industry. Rather, farmers, scientists and decision makers must work to solve the broad resource management problems that face taro farming. Lack of meaningful support to address the drastically increasing challenges from invasive diseases, pests, excessive and illegal diversions of water, and operating costs, has led to a decrease in taro farming and a taro shortage in Hawaii. With appropriate political, scientific and community support, taro will once again be a primary resource for Hawaii's food security, contributing significantly to a healthy local diet and economy. GMO-taro and patents, however, could destroy the safety and sanctity of natural taro as an important allergy-free food, cultural resource and local agricultural industry in Hawaii. As a strong supporter of taro farming in Hawaii, I ask you to protect the security of the health of natural taro and the local taro industry by establishing a ban on GMO-taro. Malama 'Aina, Mark S.

Box 11085 103A SB709-SD1 Walter the Hawaii Legislators: RE: GMO Legislation in State of Hawaii. For once can we just use common sense in making long terms decisions that affect the health and welfare of our people ... As publicly elected officials you have a responsibility to protect the people of Hawaii. Caution is strongly advised on allowing GMO to taint our food supply. Unfortunately, pollinating GMO strains become invasive when released into the environment. By their virulent nature GMO strains infect and dominate the gene pool forever. You CAN NOT recall a GMO strain once introduced. Case in point is the accidental release of GMO rice after Hurricane Katrina destroyed the GMO testing facility, cross pollination of soybean in Canada, accidental mishandling and release of GMO corn seed to Central American countries and the list goes on. The fact remains that you CAN NOT recall a GMO strain once introduced. It is all too common that a well meaning scientific community together with profit oriented corporations makes hasty decisions with disastrous consequences. Case in point, DDT, Pesticides, CFC's, Cigarettes and Hydrogenated Oils, all market driven profit centers for large corporations and allowed without through study or applying the Precautionary Principle. Twenty years from now if we find that trans-genetic organisms in the food supply cause cancer, birth defects, immune deficiencies or worse, we would struggle to mitigate the consequences because we CAN NOT recall those GMO strains from the gene pool. Please apply the Precautionary Principle ... it is there for a reason ... it's just common sense. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary principle I understand the pressures you have in making this decision as evidenced by the number of Bills being generated to address the GMO issue ...

Sometimes being cautious and saying no to money interests is the right answer. My opinion, as a coffee and vegetables farmer, is the GMO approach to solving our agricultural challenges is extremely risky, not well thought out, is seriously under studied, and controversial for many valid reasons ... My position, as a coffee and vegetables farmer is simple. GMO strains released accidentally or intentionally take away my freedom of choice to consume, grow, market and sell non GMO food products. Any GMO introduction will destroy my market for specialty Kona Coffee. My coffee sold at commodity grade prices $3.00 Ib will force me into bankruptcy as well as other growers involved in meeting the expanding markets for non GMO or Organic Foods. There is no current way to contain pollen drift and consequently no way for Non GMO and Organic farming to coexist GMO farming. Agriculture is really pretty simple as understood and practiced for thousands of years by large sophisticated cultures. It starts with the soiL .. A healthy, fertile soil is a dynamic organism, full of microbial and fungal life that transforms organic matter into humus. Humus is a stable byproduct that provides all the nutrients, trace minerals and gases necessary for sustained vegetative outputs. If you acknowledge that fact and support soil fertility in your agricultural practices, food production becomes sustainable and profitable. Healthy soils produce healthy plants, which when consumed produce healthy people and animals. On the other hand, a sick unbalanced soil produces dis-ease, first in the soil, then in the plants and then in the animals and people who consume them. Until we get back to applying this knowledge in agriculture we will be chasing the problems, we created, with back end solutions like GMO and oil based chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides. Sick plants from sick soils are stressed and attract pests, who by the way are only doing their job of eliminating weakness in the natural ecosystem. oAmory Lovins, CEO of Rocky Mountain Institute, \"If we don't understand how things are connected, often solutions become the problem\". While the Biotech Industry has made significant contributions in medical research, and I am not saying there isn't a place for them or the \"tools\" they develop in Agriculture, I just don't believe that GMO in our food supply is a good idea, especially when the testing has not been done and the consumer is not given the choice. The potential risks far outweigh the potential benefits. Caution is strongly recommended. The UH can and will find other agricultural problems to study and make meaningful, less risky contributions to our ag economy until the GMO issue can be worked out. Even though I do not support GMO in agriculture ... If you folks enact laws that allow Hawaii to continue with GMO research, testing and field trials, we must demand, through legislation, that GMO research, testing and field trials follow the established Control Group Protocol used in all valid experiential testing. http:Uen.wikipedia.org/wikilControl group Due to the invasive nature and permanence of GMO strains in the food chain it would be prudent to establish the entire Big Island as the Control Group for any ongoing GMO research, testing, and field trials. Being upwind of the other Hawaiian Islands may give us some measure of protection against pollen drift cross contamination and physical isolation from experiments gone wrong. This way the Big Island can make a significant contribution to Hawaii's food security and agricultural research at the same time. o We must establish the Big Island as a GMO Free Zone for all research, testing and field trials related to human and animal food and or seed production. o Exemption to the law would be allowed for non-food related agricultural industries like orchids and other cut flowers as well as for the Papaya industry, because GMO strains hav already been released and are found widely in the wild plant population. If you folks don't demonstrate respect for GMO risks to public health and safety, the cultural aspects of taro and the economic aspects of non GMO related farming, you may be committing political suicide. Basically you can piss off a few multi national companies and UH researchers or you can piss off a whole lot of voters ... Just follow the Precautionary Principle and you can put the responsibility back on the GMO companies where it belongs and protect yourselves, your kids, your grand kids and neighbors from eating questionable foods.

The UH can and will find other agricultural problems to study and make meaningful, less risky contributions to our ag economy until the GMO issue can be worked out. Even though I do not support GMO in agriculture ... If you folks enact laws that allow Hawaii to continue with GMO research, testing and field trials, we must demand, through legislation, that GMO research, testing and field trials follow the established Control Group Protocol used in all valid experiential testing. httl'://cn.wikipcdia.org/ wikilControl group Due to the invasive nature and permanence of GMO strains in the food chain it would be prudent to establish the entire Big Island as the Control Group for any ongoing GMO research, testing, and field trials. Being upwind of the other Hawaiian Islands may give us some measure of protection against pollen drift cross contamination and physical isolation from experiments gone wrong. This way the Big Island can make a significant contribution to Hawaii's food security and agricultural research at the same time. o We must establish the Big Island as a GMO Free Zone for all research, testing and field trials related to human and animal food and or seed production. o Exemption to the law would be allowed for non-food related agricultural industries like orchids and other cut flowers as well as for the Papaya industry, because GMO strains have already been released and are found widely in the wild plant population. If you folks don't demonstrate respect for GMO risks to public health and safety, the cultural aspects oftaro and the economic aspects of non GMO related farming, you may be committing political suicide. Basically you can piss off a few multi national companies and UH researchers or you can piss off a whole lot of voters ... Just follow the Precautionary Principle and you can put the responsibility back on the GMO companies where it belongs and protect yourselves, your kids, your grand kids and neighbors from eating questionable foods. Alohanui, Walter Andrade Kona and Kalopa Farmer P.O. Box 586 HI 96725 Testimony of Ed Wendt Taro Farmer, Wailuanui East Maui In Support of Senate Bill 709-SD 1 and HB 1663 Dear Committee Members: Please support Senate Bill 709-SDI and House Bill 1663, that would impose a moratorium on all testing, propagating, cultivating, growing and raising genetically engineered taro in Hawai'i, and apply to genetically-modified plants brought in from outside Hawai'i as well. Passage of this bill will ensure the safety and perpetuation of our native kalo, and I urge your support. Our 'ohana have been full-time kalo farmers in Wailuanui, East Maui for many generations. My sons and grandchildren work 10' i kalo alongside me and my brother. The species of kalo that we farm have been cultivated in our village families for many generations. The kalo is strong, nutritious and although our 'ohana has encountered many challenges (various diseases, foreign snail infestations, lack of water), we have preservered and continue to grow kalo for our families. Allowing GMO kalo would put our 10' i kalo at great risk and adulterate Hawaiian kalo species that our families have been cultivating for many generations. There is data which suggests there is no way to secure existing species from contamination once GMO experimentation is permitted. We urge your support of S.B. 709-SD 1 and H.B.1663 in order that we can continue to perpetuate, practice and honor our Hawaiian traditions and culture. Mahalo for this opportunity to testify. Ed Wendt P.O. Box 961 Haiku, Hawai'i 96708 Testimony of Leslie Yee Hoy, Taro Farmer, Halawa Valley-Molokai In Support of Ban on GMO-Taro Aloha mai kakou, I join communities across Hawaii in rejecting the genetic modification of all taro varieties, by supporting a ban on GMO-taro. I am deeply concerned about the unknown health risks, irreversible threats to native ecosystems, cultural disrespect, patenting and bioprospecting of Hawaii's natural resources and potential harms to our local farming economy that are associated with GMO-taro. -Taro Deserves the Best Available Science- GMO-taro is claimed to potentially reduce one type of taro disease in one variety of taro by creating irreversible, unnatural genetic mutations whose safety to consumers and the environment is not scientifically proven. GMO-taro has no proven benefits to taro farmers or consumers and is not the best available science needed to safely perpetuate taro farming and protect consumers in Hawaii. Better and safer options exist. Long-term scientific studies and farming practices throughout the Pacific have resulted in proven scientific techniques to expand the local taro industry, protect unique Hawaiian taro varieties, farmlands and watersheds-- without GMOs. These community-accepted practices include: organically improving soil health, establishing appropriate water-flow standards to prevent disease and pests, stopping imports of diseased taro and pests into Hawaii, and growing many traditional varieties of natural taro with different natural disease resistance. Being that safer science exists, there is no need or demand for experimental GMO-taro from local taro farmers or consumers. -Health and Environmental Safety Concerns about GMO-Taro- Taro is a nutritious food crop, especially cherished as a baby food and staple dish in Hawaii for centuries; and around the world as an important medicinal food for diabetes, cancer, autism and serious food allergies. Taro is the worlds only hypo-allergenic, or allergy-free, carbohydrate. GMO-taro, on the other hand, is not the same as natural taro. GMO-taro has never been in the human food supply before, and has NOT been scientifically tested on humans to prove that it is safe to eat. Moreover, the unnatural genetic mutations of GMO\u00ad taro can never be guaranteed to be hypo-allergenic, thus threatening consumers of this uniquely important medicinal food source. In fact, numerous scientific studies on laboratory animals show that GMOs can cause toxic, allergic, and even deadly reactions. Unnatural gene mutations introduced through GMO-taro may harm insects, birds, fish, and soil health. Risks and damages to Hawaii's people and lands could be irreversible. -Community and Ethical Concerns about GMO-Taro- Cultivated throughout centuries to be abundantly grown on Hawaii's diverse agricultural lands, taro is the sacred foundation of our unique local agriculture, society, traditions and family structure. Genetic modification of taro is an affront to the sacred Hawaiian tradition that respects the taro plant as a family member, an older brother to humanity. This family tradition is rooted in honoring the relationship of mankind with the very plants we depend on for healthy nourishment, and establishes an unique genealogical connection between taro and the Hawaiian people. The wisdom of such healthy community values must be encouraged, not disrespected or desecrated. Despite the unique and utmost importance of this plant to our community, GMO-taro has been developed without any informed community consent, raising serious ethical science concerns. Businesses and researchers in Hawaii should encourage informed community consent and review, not avoid oversight and involvement from the very communities most effected by their activities. PDF processed with CutePDF evaluation edition www.CutePDF.com -Economic and Bioprospecting Concerns about GMO-Taro- The right to grow taro naturally and traditionally belongs to the public, and should never be owned by a corporation or university. Private patents and control of our public food resources would cripple our food security, taro economy and violate our inherent public rights. GMO-taro experiments and patents cannot help taro farmers with the real problems that they face and will only endanger the valuable traditional biodiversity of taro in Hawaii. -Legal and Governance Concerns about Preemption Legislation- In \"exchange\" for a ban on GMO-taro, the biotech/GMO industry may attempt to turn our community's intentions to protect taro into unfair \"preemption\" legislation which would prohibit state or county oversight, and public notice of all other GMOs and biotech activities in Hawaii. We do not support any such attempts to preempt legitimate local government regulations to protect public health. Preempting local efforts to protect public health raises serious legal, ethical, and scientific concerns-- our public and environmental safety, as well as our local-governance authority, must be prioritized over private investment concerns and high-risk experiments. -Help Taro, Don't Hurt Taro!- Agricultural science has proven that the taro will be as healthy as the land in which it is grown and the care with which it is shown. There is no actual need to permanently change the taro plant's natural genetic structure nor patent the plant for private profit in order to protect the local taro industry. Rather, farmers, scientists and decision makers must work to solve the broad resource management problems that face taro farming. Lack of meaningful support to address the drastically increasing challenges from invasive diseases, pests, excessive and illegal diversions of water, and operating costs, has led to a decrease in taro farming and a taro shortage in Hawaii. With appropriate political, scientific and community support, taro will once again be a primary resource for Hawaii's food security, contributing significantly to a healthy local diet and economy. GMO-taro and patents, however, could destroy the safety and sanctity of natural taro as an important allergy-free food, cultural resource and local agricultural industry in Hawaii. As a strong supporter of taro farming in Hawaii, I ask you to protect the security of the health of natural taro and the local taro industry by establishing a ban on GMO-taro.

Governor Duke Aiona House of Representatives Senate Representatives Re: Legislative Bills on Taro and Water Aloha, As one of the few Hawaiian Taro farmers, 7th generation mahi' ai and lawai' a, I appeal to you to support our cause to maintain the purity of the Hawaiian taro, increase water access, provide more land and provide financial assistance and disaster insurance. What we need is to become more sustainable, as were our kupuna of days of old. What we need today is for leaders such as yourselves to be bold, to stand up for what you know is pono and not yield to compromise that will undermine the life of our lands. For Ke Akua says, do not commit blasphemy against the land, for this will be an abomination. Support our cause to maintain the purity of the Hawaiian taro and kalo lifestyle. Support the increase of water access in favor of the mahi' ai. Support the provision of more lands for farming. Support financial assistance and disaster insurance in favcor of the mahi' ai. Our Ali' i knew that their success was dependant on the foundation of its people, for indeed the \"Iife of the land is perpetuated in righteousness\". Thus the Hawaii State Constitution placed the kuleana of the lands above all things. Doing pono and making pono for all things upon the land increased the prosperity of its people. As Kumu John Kaimikaua stated so well, \"when the land flourishes, so does it's people\". On May 1, 1959 our state motto was adopted by Joint Resolution No.4 of the 30th Territorial Legislature. Today in this 2009 Legislature you are the centennials that stand watch upon the land and its people. Do not let us be ambushed. Stand firm upon the aina, with and for its people. Ua mau ke ea 0 ka aina I ka pono ... The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness. George Keoki Ruisuki Fukumitsu Mahi' Box 454, Hana, HI 96713 www.kipahulu.org February 18, 2009 I am writing on behalf of the Kipahulu Ohana to urge your support of a ban on the genetic modification of kalo in Hawai'i. Kipahulu Ohana is a nonprofit organization founded in 1995 by descendents of the Kipahulu moku in East Maui in order to promote the practice of traditional ahupua'a management, restoration and education. Since 1995, through a Cooperative Agreement with the National Park Service, we have operated Kapahu Living Farm within the Kipahulu section of Haleakala National Park where we farm over three acres of ancient kalo lo'i that has been restored to active production. Kapahu Living Farm is managed by our Project Director and traditional konohiki John Lind. Through the knowledge passed down to him and his personal experience, Lind has identified several varieties of Hawaiian kalo that he chooses to cultivate, because they are hearty and make high quality poi. Our production is completely organic-we use no chemical fertilizers or pesticides. While we do have minor challenges with some diseases, Lind has found that these challenges can be adequately addressed by ensuring a plentiful flow of cold water around and through the lo'i, using green manure (weeds) buried in the lo'i to feed the kalo plants along with other natural fertilizers, and other traditional techniques. From a practical standpoint, we have no interest or need for genetically modified varieties of kalo. From a cultural and spiritual standpoint, we want to emphasize the deep connection Hawaiians have with Haloa, and strongly oppose the genetic modification of this plant that is the single most important plant in the Hawaiian culture, considered as the elder brother of the Hawaiian people. We ask that you support measures to prohibit the development, testing, propagation, release, importation, planting, or growing of genetically modified taro in the State of Hawaii. ~Mahalo, ~ j . Scott Crawford j Executive Director Support for Ban on GMO-Taro From Joan lander (Taro Grower) Aloha mai, We live in Ka'u on Hawai'i island and plant taro in our yard. We are very happy that our county council listened to the voices of taro growers and consumers and passed a ban on GMO taro on our island. Now this ban needs to be extended to all islands. This food plant is too important to our health to be interfered with. We all need to consume taro in its pure form. If you allow people to tinker with taro's genetics, we can never again be sure that the taro we eat is safe. Growers will not exchange huli anymore for fear of planting taro that is unsafe, thus breaking down a centuries-old tradition of sharing huli. Why would you want to destroy the solidarity of our taro-growing communities and introduce fear and anxiety into the most important agricultural activity in Hawai'i? You as lawmakers must act on behalf of the people, not the few determined to manipulate the basic foods we eat, no matter the cost. Do the right thing and protect, at the very least, this plant that is the heart and soul of Hawai'i. Joan Lander PO Box 29 Na'alehu, Hawai'i 96772-0029 In Support of Ban on GMO-Taro Daniel Bishop & 'Ohana- Taro Farmers My name is Daniel Bishop and, together with my wife, four sons, and their families, are Kalo farmers in Waiahole valley. We have also been members of Onipaa Na Hui Kalo since it's beginning. I am writing this letter to voice our support for a ban on any type of research which has to do with genetically modifying any Kalo . Respectfully submitted; Daniel Bishop Attention: State of Hawai'i Legislators STRONG SUPPORT FOR BAN ON From: o Ka'a'awa Aloha mai kakou, o wau 0 Robert Kealohapumehana Domingo and I am writing to srongly encourage all legislators and lawmakers to support and pass SB709 moratorium on developing, testing, propagating, cultivating, growing and raising genetically engineered taro in the state of Hawai'i. It is well known and documented within the Hawaiian genealogy chant or Kumulipo, Kupuna Haloa Nakalaukapalili is said to be the elder brother of Kanaka or mankind. As a Kanaka Maoli or native Hawaiian, Hawaiian cultural practitioner, head of household, husband, father ofthree children, haumana mahi'ai kalo, traditional style poi maker or ku'i 'ai practitioner, kalo grower and consumer, supporter and parent of the Hawaiian language immersion schools, taxpayer and voter, I must make my voice and mana'o or opinion heard loud and clear: Genetic modification ofkalo is DISRESPECTFUL!! GMO taro is NOT PONO! It is not necessary and not wanted. Genetic engineering of Hawaiian kalo should not be allowed within these islands or anywhere elsefor that matter. Kalo, not only a spiritual center or piko of Hawaiian culture, a traditional symbol of the 'ohana structure, has been the staple food of Hawaiians since the beginning of time, and for many other cultures in more recent years. We the Kanaka Maoli for well over a thousand years have been growing and have been sustained and nourished by kalo planted in the traditional methods. Especially in the form of poi, kalo was eaten by all branches ofthe 'ohana from the oldest kupuna perhaps in their deathbed to the newest of infants still upon their mother's breast. Poi was widely known by the po'e kahiko or people of the past, to have many benefits: tremendous nutritional value, ease of digestion (complex carbohydrate), it is also hypoallergenic thus eliminating the concern for allergic reaction. It would be disastrous to allow such an extremely valuable and irreplaceable resource to become contaminated, mutated and exposed to the risk altering it's proven \"super-food\" qualities. Genetic modification is commonly known to inherently introduce undesirable properties including possible allergens and antibiotic resistant genes. Keep kalo pure! Altering taro is unsafe and is BAD SCIENCE! The po'e kahiko were extremely knowledgeable ofthe 'aina and of our fragile yet bountiful environment. They knew how to properly utilize the resources and viewed the land as a sacred. \"Ua mau ke 'ea 0 ka 'aina i ka pono: the life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness\" If we disturb the pono or balance of the 'aina, we are destined to suffer the consequences. It has been documented that the kanaka maoli once had upwards of 300 varieties of kalo developed naturally through generations of a natural conventional hybrid process. Today there is said to be only approximately 80 varieties remaining. The modern colonized ideals of profit, ownership, convenience, overdevelopment, misuse of land, water and other natural resources, overall short sightedness and a lack of due care has begun to outweigh our traditional values and has taken a toll on our 'aina and ultimately our beloved Kalo. Lo'i kalo or traditional wetland taro patches, once had thriving veins of cold water fed by a clean and well maintained kahawai or stream. Today, our streams are reduced, many to a trickle, some have gone dry. Mahi'ai kalo once had enough acreage to allow them to let their patches lay fallow after harvest in order to replenish natural nutrients, rather than immediately replanting time and time again in depleted soil compensated with large amounts of fertilizers and chemicals, a common practice today due to limited access to lands suitable for taro farming. Another particularly interesting part of traditional methods of planting has actually been under review again in recent times, diversification. Planting many taro varieties with different characteristics that may adapt to various conditions such as higher salinity in lower elevations closer to the ocean, heat and drought resistant varieties, varieties that could be left without being harvested for extended periods of time. Another poor practice common in taro farming today is known as mono-cropping, of course the exact opposite of the traditional theories of diversification, single or limited varieties planted to fit commercial guidelines are forcing farmers to plant crops not ideal for their individual farm environments and conditions thus limiting proper growth and reducing crop volume and quality. These factors contribute to many of the struggles faced by taro farmers today. The poor practices of misuse and neglecting the 'aina need to be modified, not our kalo! GMO kalo is UNECCESSARY!! Our kupuna were truly the greatest scientists. They had hundreds of names for different winds, they studied thousands of different native plants and had thousands of different uses, they navigated the Pacific using the winds, stars and currents, in hand crafted vessels with hand made tools, they could build homes, fishponds, great altars and dry stacked stone walls that stood firm for centuries, they knew that in order to survive, they had to use what the 'aina had to offer, and that they did. It's time that we look to the past to learn for the future. In closing, I have discussed only a few of the many reasons to protect our beloved elder brother Haloa N akalaukapalili, the taro. I strongly feel that a BAN on GMO taro as described in SB709 is imperative. Let us remember that the 'aina is a limited resource and our decisions today will have great impacts for the generations oftomorrow. Keep our kalo pure and preserve it for generations to come. I sincerely hope that you, the elected lawmakers of this state, will heed my recommendation. It is time that we the people of Hawai'i heed the advice of our Kupuna. \"He ali'i ka 'aina, he kauwa ke kanaka; The land is the chief and we kanaka Taro Farmer In Support of Ban on GMO-Taro Aloha mai kakou, Ban GMO taro research and growing in Hawaii.

Here in paradise where nature provides so abundantly we can choose exclusively from Naturally Evolved Organisms (NEO). Those who would choose GMO instead would pollute the environment at our expense, externalizing their costs for monetary gain, and that would be irresponsible behavior. Malama Aina, David Webb PO Box 2167 Pahoa,H196778 PDF processed with CutePDF evaluation edition www.CutePDF.com Testimony In Support of Ban on GMO-Taro Aloha mai kakou I join communities across Hawaii in rejecting the genetic modification of all taro varieties, by supporting a ban on GMO-taro. I am deeply concerned about the unknown health risks, irreversible threats to native ecosystems, cultural disrespect, patenting and bioprospecting of Hawaii's natural resources and potential harms to our local farming economy that are associated with GMO-taro. -Taro Deserves the Best Available Science- GMO-taro is claimed to potentially reduce one type of taro disease in one variety of taro by creating irreversible, unnatural genetic mutations whose safety to consumers and the environment is not scientifically proven. GMO-taro has no proven benefits to taro farmers or consumers and is not the best available science needed to safely perpetuate taro farming and protect consumers in Hawaii. Better and safer options exist. Long-term scientific studies and farming practices throughout the Pacific have resulted in proven scientific techniques to expand the local taro industry, protect unique Hawaiian taro varieties, farmlands and watersheds-- without GMOs. These community-accepted practices include: organically improving soil health, establishing appropriate water-flow standards to prevent disease and pests, stopping imports of diseased taro and pests into Hawaii, and growing many traditional varieties of natural taro with different natural disease resistance. Being that safer science exists, there is no need or demand for experimental GMO-taro from local taro farmers or consumers. -Health and Environmental Safety Concerns about GMO-Taro- Taro is a nutritious food crop, especially cherished as a baby food and staple dish in Hawaii for centuries; and around the world as an important medicinal food for diabetes, cancer, autism and serious food allergies. Taro is the worlds only hypo-allergenic, or allergy-free, carbohydrate. GMO\u00ad taro, on the other hand, is not the same as natural taro. GMO-taro has never been in the human food supply before, and has NOT been scientifically tested on humans to prove that it is safe to eat. Moreover, the unnatural genetic mutations of GMO-taro can never be guaranteed to be hypo\u00ad allergenic, thus threatening consumers of this uniquely important medicinal food source. In fact, numerous scientific studies on laboratory animals show that GMOs can cause toxic, allergic, and even deadly reactions. Unnatural gene mutations introduced through GMO-taro may harm insects, birds, fish, and soil health. Risks and damages to Hawaii's people and lands could be irreversible. -Community and Ethical Concerns about GMO-Taro- Cultivated throughout centuries to be abundantly grown on Hawaii's diverse agricultural lands, taro is the sacred foundation of our unique local agriculture, society, traditions and family structure. Genetic modification of taro is an affront to the sacred Hawaiian tradition that respects the taro plant as a family member, an older brother to humanity. This family tradition is rooted in honoring the relationship of mankind with the very plants we depend on for healthy nourishment, and establishes an unique genealogical connection between taro and the Hawaiian people. The wisdom of such healthy community values must be encouraged, not disrespected or desecrated. Despite the unique and utmost importance of this plant to our community, GMO-taro has been developed without any PDF processed with CutePDF evaluation edition www.CutePDF.com informed community consent, raising serious ethical science concerns. Businesses and researchers in Hawaii should encourage informed community consent and review, not avoid oversight and involvement from the very communities most effected by their activities. -Economic and Bioprospecting Concerns about GMO-Taro- The right to grow taro naturally and traditionally belongs to the public, and should never be owned by a corporation or university. Private patents and control of our public food resources would cripple our food security, taro economy and violate our inherent public rights. GMO-taro experiments and patents cannot help taro farmers with the real problems that they face and will only endanger the valuable traditional biodiversity of taro in Hawaii. -Legal and Governance Concerns about Preemption Legislation- In \"exchange\" for a ban on GMO-taro, the biotech/GMO industry may attempt to turn our community's intentions to protect taro into unfair \"preemption\" legislation which would prohibit state or county oversight, and public notice of all other GMOs and biotech activities in Hawaii. We do not support any such attempts to preempt legitimate local government regulations to protect public health. Preempting local efforts to protect public health raises serious legal, ethical, and scientific concerns-- our public and environmental safety, as well as our local-governance authority, must be prioritized over private investment concerns and high-risk experiments. -Help Taro, Don't Hurt Taro!- Agricultural science has proven that the taro will be as healthy as the land in which it is grown and the care with which it is shown. There is no actual need to permanently change the taro plant's natural genetic structure nor patent the plant for private profit in order to protect the local taro industry. Rather, farmers, scientists and decision makers must work to solve the broad resource management problems that face taro farming. Lack of meaningful support to address the drastically increasing challenges from invasive diseases, pests, excessive and illegal diversions of water, and operating costs, has led to a decrease in taro farming and a taro shortage in Hawaii. With appropriate political, scientific and community support, taro will once again be a primary resource for Hawaii's food security, contributing significantly to a healthy local diet and economy. GMO-taro and patents, however, could destroy the safety and sanctity of natural taro as an important allergy-free food, cultural resource and local agricultural industry in Hawaii. As a strong supporter of taro farming in Hawaii, I ask you to protect the security of the health of natural taro and the local taro industry by establishing a ban on GMO-taro. Support of Ban on GMO-Taro Aloha mai kakou I have been growing taro in Kurtistown for nearly 30 years, and before that I grew taro on Oahu.

Taro is the worlds only hypo-allergenic, or allergy-free, carbohydrate. GMO\u00ad taro, on the other hand, is not the same as natural taro. GMO-taro has never been in the human food supply before, and has NOT been scientifically tested on humans to prove that it is safe to eat. Moreover, the unnatural genetic mutations of GMO-taro can never be guaranteed to be hypo\u00ad allergenic, thus threatening consumers of this uniquely important medicinal food source. In fact, numerous scientific studies on laboratory animals show that GMOs can cause toxic, allergic, and even deadly reactions. Unnatural gene mutations introduced through GMO-taro may harm insects, birds, fish, and soil health. Risks and damages to Hawaii's people and lands could be irreversible. -Community and Ethical Concerns about GMO-Taro- Cultivated throughout centuries to be abundantly grown on Hawaii's diverse agricultural lands, taro is the sacred foundation of our unique local agriculture, society, traditions and family structure. Genetic modification of taro is an affront to the sacred Hawaiian tradition that respects the taro plant as a family member, an older brother to humanity. This family tradition is rooted in honoring the relationship of mankind with the very plants we depend on for healthy nourishment, and establishes an unique genealogical connection between taro and the Hawaiian people. The wisdom of such healthy community values must be encouraged, not disrespected or desecrated. Despite the unique and utmost importance of this plant to our community, GMO-taro has been developed without any informed community consent, raising serious ethical science concerns. Businesses and researchers in Hawaii should encourage informed community consent and review, not avoid oversight and involvement from the very communities most effected by their activities. -Economic and Bioprospecting Concerns about GMO-Taro- The right to grow taro naturally and traditionally belongs to the public, and should never be owned by a corporation or university. Private patents and control of our public food resources would cripple our food security, taro economy and violate our inherent public rights. GMO-taro experiments and patents cannot help taro farmers with the real problems that they face and will only endanger the valuable traditional biodiversity of taro in Hawaii. -Legal and Governance Concerns about Preemption Legislation- In \"exchange\" for a ban on GMO-taro, the biotech/GMO industry may attempt to turn our community's intentions to protect taro into unfair \"preemption\" legislation which would prohibit state or county oversight, and public notice of all other GMOs and biotech activities in Hawaii. We do not support any such attempts to preempt legitimate local government regulations to protect public health. Preempting local efforts to protect public health raises serious legal, ethical, and scientific concerns-- our public and environmental safety, as well as our local-governance authority, must be prioritized over private investment concerns and high-risk experiments. -Help Taro, Don't Hurt Taro!- Agricultural science has proven that the taro will be as healthy as the land in which it is grown and the care with which it is shown. There is no actual need to permanently change the taro plant's natural genetic structure nor patent the plant for private profit in order to protect the local taro industry. Rather, farmers, scientists and decision makers must work to solve the broad resource management problems that face taro farming. Lack of meaningful support to address the drastically increasing challenges from invasive diseases, pests, excessive and illegal diversions of water, and operating costs, has led to a decrease in taro farming and a taro shortage in Hawaii. With appropriate political, scientific and community support, taro will once again be a primary resource for Hawaii's food security, contributing significantly to a healthy local diet and economy. GMO-taro and patents, however, could destroy the safety and sanctity of natural taro as an important allergy-free food, cultural resource and local agricultural industry in Hawaii. As a strong supporter of taro farming in Hawaii, I ask you to protect the security of the health of natural taro and the local taro industry by establishing a ban on GMO-taro.

Malama Aina, Mele Coelho 230 Kaelepulu st. Kailua, HI 96734 Testimony In Support of Ban on GMO-Taro Aloha mai kakou Representing the collective voice of many residents from the island of Molokai, I am asking our Hawaii State Legislature to protect our island as well as the State of Hawaii from the potentially damaging effects occurred by the introduction, propagation and experimentation of genetic modification of all taro varieties grown within the State of Hawaii. The introduction of genetically engineered taro has the potential of creating irreversible damage to our native ecosystems, demonstrates a complete disregard for Native Hawaiian Culture and allows for privatized patenting of Hawaii's natural resources. The genetic modification of crops in general is an infant science whose complete effects are yet to be known. Many documented cases of the harmful health effects on humans of GMO crops exist including- allergenic problems, respiratory problems, intestinal reactions and skin problems. Further conclusion through reasonable scientific deduction suggests increases in miscarriages, birth defects and cancer. Regardless of these evidences, adequate studies in regard to the effects of GMO crops on humans have not been conducted. In laboratory tests on mice and rats scientific laboratory tests unequivocally reveal that genetically modified crops have caused damage to kidneys, stomach lesions, sterility, excessive cell growth to the small intestine and even death. Field studies on cows, goats, sheep and pigs have revealed similar devastating results. Taro remains the world's only allergy-free carbohydrate and contributes significantly to the welfare and health of human life. On the other hand the unnatural genetic mutations of GMO-taro can never be guaranteed to be hypo-allergenic, thus, any transgenic contamination to indigenous varieties of taro as well as to other natural growing varieties of taro, has the potential of robbing Native Hawaiians and consumers alike of this uniquely important medicinal food source. At this ~ime we understand there to be no proven benefits of GMO Taro to taro farmers or consumers and all proposed benefits remain to be purely speculative. The Taro Security and Purity Task Force, established under Act 211, has acknowledged that GMO Taro is not the best available science needed to safely perpetuate taro farming or the most suitable option in protecting consumers in Hawaii. Options for the control of taro disease include cold water induction, reduction of over planting and recent developments which include the introduction of non contaminating fish toxins to successfully control such diseases. In representing the community of Molokai, we will not tolerate such disrespect of our culture, blindly except the potential damaging consequences to our 'aina or except the health risks placed upon our people.

Box 72 Maunaloa, HI 96770 Testimony In Support of Ban on GMO-Taro Aloha mai kakou My name is Seth Raabe. I am a farmer at Kikoo in Kipahulu on the Island of MauL I plant kalo along with many other things in a natural way. There is always abundance so we are supported economically as well as physically nourished. I firmly believe that a viable future for these Islands can only be achieved by returning to balance with our environment. This is why I am calling out to all of you to support the bill banning genetic modification of our life staple. To not protect our main food source in a natural state would be sheer stupidity. Look around the world. Look at Mexico ... contaminated beyond repair. Hawaii nei is the heartland of the kalo plant; by far the greatest diversity of varieties in one place on Earth. I hope this is common knowledge for all of you making this decision. So I respectfully ask each and everyone of you voting on these bills to look into your heart and ask what is more important for our future: continuing the natural legacy of the kalo plant, or giving it up for an elite sector to gain patent rights and power to alter our life staple.
