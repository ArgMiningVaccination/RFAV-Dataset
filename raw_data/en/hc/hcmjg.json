When they were refused asylum, Cloona opened its doors to health tourists seeking a secluded retreat with yoga, massage, sauna and walks. Thirty years on, the focus is still on a holistic approach to well-being through a light, cleansing, natural diet to aid detoxification, and energising walks, massage and yoga. \"Cloona in Ibiza\" is planned for winter 2004. Weight off your body: Like most retreats, you are advised to avoid caffeine, alcohol, sugary foods and red meats for at least four days before your visit to reduce cravings. Meals are cleansing fruit and organic vegetables, salads, soups, herbal teas and lots of local spring water. With long walks focusing on posture and movement awareness, you can also expect to lose a few pounds. Weight off your mind: Stress-busting deep tissue massage, reflexology and Japanese sheiki-shiatsu (pressure point massage) can be booked for \u00a328 an hour.

What to take with you: A good book, walking shoes for country strolls, and slippers. What you'll bring back: More energy and, they hope, a little more understanding of how to lead a healthier life.

Weight off your body: You'll lose pounds in toxins and sweat, and by gradually reducing your calorie intake. You'll find a personalised timetable on your bed on arrival (a detailed questionnaire is filled in on booking).
