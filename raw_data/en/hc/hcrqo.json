During a pandemic, worldwide epidemics of influenza due to a new viral subtype occur simultaneous ly and with high death rates. Pandemics have been documented every ten to forty years dating back to the 1600s, and likely long before that. There were th ree during the last century al one. The worst was 1918 to 1919 when over 20 million people died worldwide. The last pandemic occurred in 1968. Experts agree - we are over due for another. Progress in medical science has ena bled the medical com munity to id entify, chara cterize and produce vaccines for new influenza sub- types, but th e ease and sp eed with whi ch people now move around the world enables rapid global dispersion of the virus. Between the onset of a pandemic a nd the production When a pandemic occurs - and it will - no time can be lost in responding. This means that we must work now to develop efficient and dissemination of an effective vaccine lies a period of months during which medical and social resources will be stretched to the limit. d effective interventions. This revised lanning guide is intended to help all of us ine an p anticipate, pr epare and res pond to the next influenza pandemic and to other new and emerging diseases. Every influenza season should be viewed as an o pportunity to ref this planning. P.R.W.

INTRODUCTION Some time in the future, British Colu mbia (BC) will face an influenza pandemic - a global epidemic caused by a strain of influ enza virus that spreads ra pidly and causes high rates of illness a nd death. No one can predict exactly when this will ha ppen but scientists say it may be imminent. Most experts believe we will have between one and six months b etween the time an influenza pandemic str ain is first identified globally and th e time that outbreaks begin in BC. Within three months from arrival in BC, we expect that most communities in the province will be affected, and that the impact will continue for six months or more. The World Health Organization (W HO) works clos ely with a variety of international an d national organizations to monitor influenza activity at all ti mes. By working closely with groups around the world the WHO hopes to provide early warning of th e arrival of pandemic influenza activity, which will occur not just once, but in a series of waves that may strike different parts of the province at different times and with v arying levels of intensi ty. (See Section 1.1 for the planning assumptions on which this Plan is based.) According to estimates fo r British Columbia: \u0089 More than three million people w ill be infected with the virus. \u0089 As many as 1.8 million p eople will become clinically ill. \u0089 Up to 610,000 people will visit a health care provider. \u0089 Up to 18,500 people will need hospital care. \u0089 As many as 6,800 people will die fro m influenza and related complications. These estimates are based not on a worst-case scenario, but on the impact of the 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics, which were relatively mild compared with the 1918 pandemic. There is no way to predict th e severity of the next pan demic. For detailed information on estimatin g the impact of pandemic influenza on BC health au thorities, see Annex B . Clearly, such a widespread outbreak of illness has enormous implications for every sector of society, from front-line health care workers to business and industry; from social support agencies to funeral service providers. Although th e pandemic i tself cannot be prevented , effective planning now can mitigate its impact. Accordingly, the goal of this planning process is to minimize rates of death, illness and sufferin g as well as the scope of social and economic upheaval. The purpos e of this Pla n is to infor m British Columbians about the glob al and local risks of an infl uenz a pandemic, and to pro vide the information and g uidelines needed to ful fill role s and respo nsbilities to minimize these risks. i One of the best ways to prepare fo r a pa ndemic is to make better use of existing prevention and control measures between pandemics. Version 3 August 2005 3BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan 1.1. Planning Assumptions \u0089 Based on the last two pandemics, it is estimated that the next pandemic virus will arrive in Canada withi n 3 months a fter it emerges in another part of the world. This time could b e much shorter due to increases in th e volume and speed of air travel. \u0089 The first peak of illness in Canada will occur within two to four months after the virus arrives in Canada. \u0089 The first peak in mortality will be one month after the peak in illness. \u0089 If the pandemic virus arrives close to the usual annual influenza season, the time interval between emergence, arrival and/or peak illness and mortality will be shortened. \u0089 A pandemic usually has two or more waves, either in the same year or in successive influenza seasons. \u0089 A second wave will occur within 3 to 9 months of the initial outbreak wave and may cause more serious illnesses and deaths than the first. \u0089 Each wave of illness will last 6 to 8 weeks. \u0089 Vaccine will be the primary means of pandemic influenza prevention. The supply will be limited during the early stages of the pandemic ; therefore, plans for the first wave should assume lack of influenza vaccine and priorities for vaccination will need to be established. \u0089 A substantial proportion of the workforce will not be able to work for some period of time due to illness in themselves or in their family members. \u0089 Health care workers are likely to be at hi gher risk o f illness due to their exposures. \u0089 Effective preventive and therapeutic resources will be in short supply. \u0089 Essential co mmunity ser vices are likely to be disrupted. Version 3 August 2005 4BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan 2. ABOUT THE PLAN 2.1. A work in progress This Plan is a work in progress, based on foun dations established during 19 99/200 0 by the BC Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee (BCPIAC) with guidance and sup port from Communicable Disease Epidemiology Services of the BC Centre for Disease Control (B CCDC). The plan will be revised and refined by the BCPIAC as needed. In 2004, s ubsequent to the 2003 SARS outbreak, the BCPIAC reconvened with the goal of revising the BC Pandemic Influenza Plan. This version of the Plan (Version 2) comes fr om that revision process - a process which will continue as needed and as appropriate. 2.2. Organi zation The main body of this plan is arranged in thr ee sections, representing th e three pandemi c phases: \u0089 Pre-pandemic \u0089 Pandemic \u0089 Post-pandemic In each section, provincial and health authority ro les and responsibilities are outlined. Each section further covers the six key com ponents of pandemic planning: \u0089 Emergency r health services \u0089 Surveillance \u0089 Communication The information is organized in a char t format, as illustrated below: Provincial Responsi bilities Health Authority Responsi bilities Emergency Antivirals Clinical He alth Services Surveillance Communic ation The first chart in each section is a high-level summary or \"snapshot\" of roles and responsibilities in all six areas for that pandemic phase. This is follo wed by a seri es of more detailed charts specifically addressing each of the si x planning areas for that pandemic phase. Version 3 August 2005 5BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan The purpose of this form at is to give a general overview of the key planning responsibilities and also to provide detail for specific pandemic planning. Because of its multi-sectoral and techn ical nature, this documen t contains m any abbrevia tions, acronyms and medical ter ms. A glossary can be found on page 31. 2.3. Plans Since pandemics are global events, this Plan is consistent with other provincial, national and international plans for pandemic influenza prep aredness and response (listed below and under Influenza Information Resources ). As they are dev eloped, future updates to this Plan will also have direct links to regional and facility pandemic plans throughout British Columbia. \u0089 World Health Organization (WHO) y Guidelines for Pandemic Preparedness (www.who.i nt/csr/disea se/influenza/pandemic/ en/) n/) \u0089 Public Health Agency of Pandemic Influenza Plan ( www.phac-a spc.gc.ca/cpip-pclcpi/ ) \u0089 BC Ministry of Health Services, BC Public A ffairs Bureau, and BC Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General/Provincial Emergency Program y British Columbia Pandemic Influenza Consequence Management Plan (www.pep.bc.ca/hazard_ plans/PI_Conse quence_ Management_Plan_2004-03.pdf ) \u0089 Alberta Heal th emic Influenza Response Plan (www.health.gov.ab.ca/public/pandem ic/PandemicPlan.html ) www.gov.mb.ca/health/ pandemic.html ) \u0089 Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care y Ontario Health Pandemic Influenza Plan (www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/m inistry_reports/pandemic/p andemic_pla n04_mn.html ) This Plan focuses on provincial pandemic in fluenza planning and does not detail federal responsibilities, which are addressed in the Canadi an Pandemic Influenza Plan (see link above) and summarized in Annex H . However, th e federal government is a key player in the pandemi c planning process. Every health authority wi thin BC is encouraged to set up its own committee(s) or working group(s) to develop a nd implemen t pandemic p lans for its re gion. It is recommended that th e provincial guidelines be followed as closely as po ssible to ensure consisten cy among health authoriti es. Version 3 August 2005 6BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan 3. ROLES AND RESPONSIB ILITIES Everyone has a role to play in planning for an influenza pand emic. In order to optimize the province's readiness, all British Columbians should be involved in the planning process no matter where they live or what they do for a living. As the process ev olves, provincial, health a uthority, municipal and other authorities will develop strategi es to inform and engage the broadest possible cross-section of citizens. Although this Plan is the focal point for provin cial pandemic pr eparedness, every BC government ministry, crown corporati on and local government is also responsible for developing its own plan to ensure that k ey public services continu e to be availa ble during a pandemic. Health authorities, health care facilities and othe r organizations at the regional and local level are responsible for developing their own pandemic pl ans, in consultation with appropriate stakeholders. Under provi ncial legisla tion, the Mi nistry of Health Services (MOHS), led by the Provincial Health Officer (PHO), has the lead auth ority in all three phases of this Plan. Oth er key players are: \u0089 BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) \u0089 BC Provincial Emergency Program (PEP) \u0089 Health Authorities (including First Nations Health Authorities ) \u0089 Public Health \u0089 Hospitals \u0089 Community Care \u0089 Public Health Agency of Canada. (PHAC) These organizations are critical to the planning process. Howev er, as noted above, all British Columbians can - and should - get involved in pand emic planning and preparation. The best way to start is to stay informed and take steps - lik e annual immunization - to p rotect agains t influenza. The roles and responsibilities of various groups and organizations affected are found throughout the Annexes of this Plan. Please note the list of stakeholders will expand as the planning pro cess evolves. Everyone h as a role to play in prepar ing for a pandemic. You can start by: - Staying informed. - Ensuring you are immunized o n a yearly basis. Version 3 August 2005 7BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan 4. EMERGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Because of its immense scope and br oad, prolonged impact, an influenza pandemic will result in additional co sts in a number of different areas. D uring an emergency, local government bodies - including mu nicipalities, regional districts, health authorities and education au thorities - may be eligible for financial assist ance to offset some of th ese extraordinary costs. During a pandemic, information regarding availabl e emergency financial assistance will be posted on the Provincial Emergency Program web site at www.pep.bc.ca . Be prepared to docum ent any extra costs incurred during a pandemic. You may be eligible for compensation under the Disaster Financial Assi stance Program.

Pre-Pandemic Overview This is the critical stage for pandemic p reparedne ss. The pre-pandemic phase is now, and planning efforts need to focus on three things: \u0089 Building the province's capacit y to effectively respond to an influenza pandemic. \u0089 Building cooperation among British Columbians, starting wi th those in and essential to, the health care s ystem. \u0089 Building communication networks, to support both the planning process and the pand emic response. The table bel ow provides a snapshot of key provin cial and health authority responsibilities during the pre-pand emic phase. Each area is discusse d in greater detail throughout this section. Information for individual care providers and othe r specific stakeholder groups is contain ed in the Annexes of this Plan.

During the pre-pande mic phase, we need to build three things: - Capacity - Cooperation - Communic ation networks Version 3 August 2005 10BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan 5.2. Pre-Pandemic: Emergency Response The province of British Columbia has an estab lished Emergency Response Management System, designed to ensure a coordinated, organized response to all emergencies and disasters. Fo r further information, visit the Provincial Emergency Program website a t www.pep.bc. ca. All emergency response plans developed at the prov incial, health authority, regional and local levels should be consistent with this standar d BC planning model and with the emergency pl ans already i n place at com munity and facility levels to cope wi th situations such as storms, floods, earthquakes and power o utages. These existing tools provide a good starting poi nt for emergency pandemic planning, inc luding a framework for establishing command , control and ma nagemen t procedures to ensure clear lines of authority an d communication duri ng the pandemi c phase (see Annex C ). Pandemics pose unique problems which distinguis h them from other types of emergencies and which will require planners to adapt existing emer gency response plans to address these issues. Namely, thes e unique features are: \u0089 The influenza pandemic will likely origina te outside North America and we may have advance war ning of its arrival. Emergency plans s hould reflect this and should clearly specify actio ns to take between the ti me the pand emic is first identified globally and the time it arrives in BC. \u0089 Outbreaks will occur simultaneously across the country, preventing reallocation of human and other res ources from one jurisdiction to another. This means each community should be prepared to operate a \"stand alone\" emergency pl an. \u0089 The influenza pandemic could last for severa l months, which sets it apart from other emergencies which may la st for several hours or days. \u0089 Health care workers and other first responders will likely face a higher risk o f infection than the general population, reducing response capaci ty. \u0089 Widespread illness will in crease the lik elihood of personnel shortages in other key areas such as police, fire, utility and transportation services. The table bel ow outlines key provincial and heal th authority emergency response responsibilities. Detailed information for individual care providers an d other specific stakeholder groups is contained in the Annex es of this Plan.

Pre-Pandemic: Vaccine Immunizatio n is the single most effective way to reduce the imp act of influenza. Getting an influenza vaccination ever y year can keep individual s healthy between pand emics. Having influenza vaccination a lso protects others: patients, grandpar ents and chil dren, especia lly those wh o don't build immunity effectively, such as seniors or t hose with comp romised immune system s. Yearly immunization programs also help build the vaccine production, supply and distribution systems that will be needed during a pandemic. In additi on, pneumococcal v accine will protect target groups against major complications of influen za. The federal government works with manufacturers, suppliers, laboratories and foreign agencies to ensure an ad equate, safe vaccine supp ly and to dist ribute vaccin e to the prov inces and ter ritories. The BCCDC Pharmacy Services coordinates the p rovincial annual allocation and distribution of vaccine. Priority groups for pandemic vaccine delivery shou ld be deter mined in the pre-pandemic phase. The national Pandemic Influenza Committee (PIC) has devel oped nationa lly recommended priority groups (see Appendix A-2 ) for immunization during a pandem ic, and these have been en dorsed by the BCCDC. All jurisdictions in BC are encourag ed to similarly adopt and en dorse these priority groups. This consistency will ensure equal access to vaccine and consistent messaging across the province and across the country. It is important to remember, however, tha t priority groups could change with the identifica tion and/or arrival of th e pandemic strain, based on the epidemiology of the influenza strain - something that cannot be predicted in adv ance. Monitoring Safety and E ffectiveness of Vaccine Monitoring vaccine safety and effecti veness will be a coordinated effort between all thos e agencies and individuals responsible for distributing the vaccine, including the Public Health Agency of Canada, the BCCDC, the health autho rities, and those who directly administer the vaccin e.

Pre-Pandemic: Antivirals Antiviral drugs are used to treat influenza illness an d to prevent it through prophylaxis. These drugs could be used in conjunction with vaccination for the management of pandemic influenza. Given the delay anticipated between th e arrival of a pand emic influenza strain and adequate va ccine supply, antivirals may be the only virus-specific interventio n available during the initial pandemic response. A national a ntivirals initiative is being developed b y the na tiona l Pandemic Influenza Committee (PIC) and its Antivirals Working Group. The objecti ves of the national an tivirals initiative are: \u0089 To recommend a strategy for the use of antivirals during a pandemic. \u0089 To address issues around the security of supply of antivirals. \u0089 To monitor drug resistance during the pandemic. \u0089 To facilitate planning to ensure the distributi on of available antiviral dru gs to appropriate groups of pe ople during the pandemic.

Pre-Pand emic: Surveillance In Canada, the federal government has lead res ponsibility for na tional influenza surveillance. It works in partnership with provincial and territorial epidemiologists and senti nel physician s to produce weekly or bi-weekly Fluwatch reports, summarizing influenza a ctivity across the country. The BCCDC coordinates BC's provinc ial influe nza surveillance system. This system compiles outbreaks reports, influe nza-like illness (ILI) surve illance from sentinel physicians, and laboratory reporting. All health authorities provide informat ion for this s urveillance system. The information compiled is summarized and provided to all health authorities, and to health practitioners and professionals across the province on a regular basis.

Pandemi c: Emergency Respons e A clear chain of comman d is essential for managing any emergency and mai ntaining control of daily operations until the crisis has passed. Therefore, the command and control structures specified in provincial, health authori ty, local and facility-level pandemic pl ans should be activated as soon as the PHO declares the start of the pandemi c phase. It will also be vital to monitor the effectiveness of various plans, as they are i mplemented, and to adapt or refine them as and wh en needed to reflect the changing nature of the pandemic emergency. BC's official provincial emergency res pons e manag ement strategy is on the internet at http://www. pep.bc.ca Under the BC Health Act , the local Medical Health Officer (MHO) has the a uthority to enact community- based control measures that he/she belie ves are important in controlling the spread of influenza and minimizing its impact (i. e. closin g community centres or schools, cancelling public gatherings). These measures will remain at his/he r discretion, under the guidance of the Provincial Health Officer, at the tim e of a pandemic.

Version 3 August 2005 43 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: Glo ssary Strain A variation of the influenza virus within a given subtype (e.g., influenza A/Panama/ H3N2, influenza A/Fujian/H3 N2). New strains appear every few years and are responsible for yearly influenza outbreaks. Sub Acute Care Comprehens ive, cost-effective inpatient le vel of care for patients who: a) have had an acute event resulting fro m injury, illn ess or exacerbation of a disease process, b) have a determined course of treatmen t and, c) though stable, require diagnostics or invasive procedures but not intens ive procedures requiring an acute level of care. Typicall y short term, sub acute care is designed to return patients to the communi ty or transition them to a lower level of care. Sub acute care is offered in a variety of physical settings. The philosophy of sub acute care is to ens ure that pati ents are receiving the most appro priate services at the mos t appropriate phase of their illness while ensuring quality, cost-effective outcomes. Subtype A classification of the influenza type A viruses based on the surface proteins hem agglutinin (H) and neura minidase (N) (see Influenza Virus).

When available, vaccine shou ld be distributed in an equ itable manner and P/Ts should adhere to similar vaccination pr otocols. The Pandemic Influenza Committee (PIC) will ide ntify and prioritize individuals and groups of people to receive vaccine. To support the overall goal of pandemic response, the prioritization process must consider the impact of th e vaccine. T he priority for vaccination is focused on reducing morbidity and mortality thr ough maintaining the health services response and through individual protection of high risk groups. In addi tion, this will help minimize societal dis ruption by maintaining the essential s ervices upon which everyone depends . Suggested guideli nes for the use of influenza vaccine in times of shor t supply hav e been developed to provide g uidance dur ng the plan ning proces s but will ne ed to be reassessed as soon as epidemiologic data on the specific pandemic virus become available. i The table bel ow provides the current v accine pr iority groups and allows HAs /HSDAs to estimate the numbers in each group. Table A-10: Vacci ne Priority Groups Vaccine Priority Group Estimate 1. Health Care Workers Rationale: The health care sector wil l be the first line of defence in a pandemic. Maintaining the health s ervice response and the vaccine program is central to the implementation of the response plan in or der to reduce morbidity and mortality. Please complete Appendix A-3 . 2. Essential Service Wo rkers Rationale: These persons maintain key community services and the ability to mount an effective pandemic response may be dependen t on them b eing in place. Please complete Appendix A-4 . 3. Persons at High Risk Rationale: Persons most likely to ha ve severe or fatal outcomes following influenza infection should be vaccin ated. The N ational Advisory Committee on Immu nization has identified the following high-risk groups for annual vaccin e recommen dations, but the order of prioritiza tion during a pandemic may vary depending on the specific virus strain. Prioritization will depe nd o n the epidemiology of the disease. Persons in n ursing homes and in long-term care facilities, homes for elderly (e.g. lodges) Persons with high risk me dical conditions living independently in the comm unity Persons over 65 years of age living independently a nd not included above Infants 6 to 23 months of age Poultry workers Version 3 August 2005 71 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex A Vaccine Priority Group Estimate Individuals who are capa ble of transmitti ng influenza to thos e at high-risk for influenza related complications, e.g. household contacts, childcare providers to infants aged 0 to 23 months. *Pregnant Women - Currently NACI does not consider pregnant women a high- risk group for annual influenza vaccinat ion. In a pandemic, they may be at elevated risk, and PIC will prioritize according to available data. An excepti on is pregnant wo men who are expected to deliv er during influenza season, as they will become household contacts of their newborn. 4. Healthy Adults Rationale: This group s hould be immunized to r educe the lik elihood that they will transmit the virus to those at high risk of severe outcomes. 5. Children (24 Months to 18 Years) Rationale: This group is at the lowest risk of deve loping severe outcomes from influenza during annual epidemics but play a major role in the spread of the disease. Version 3 August 2005 72 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex A APPENDIX A-3: HEALTH CARE WO RKER ESTIMA TES AS A PRIORITY GROUP FOR VACCINE One of the groups identified as a priority group fo r receiving vaccine is health care workers. The health care s ector will be the first line of defence in a pandemic. Maintaining the health s ervice response and the vaccine program is central to the implementation of the response plan in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Immunization of workers will reduce transmission to patients, staff and families within facilities. Health care workers may be consid ered in the following work settings for the purpose of coordinating immunization programs: \u0089 Acute care h ospitals \u0089 Long term care facilities/nursing hom es \u0089 Private physicians' offices \u0089 Home care o r other com munity care settings \u0089 Public health offices \u0089 Ambulance s taff and paramedics \u0089 Pharmacies \u0089 Laboratories The following groups, in descending order of priori ty, are offered as planning guidance but will need to be re-examined at the time of a pandemic al ert when epidemiological data about the pandemic virus is available. It is not clear whether worker s in health care f acilities other than those in the health occupations will be eligible, so p lease provide these estimates separately.

The ability to mount an effective pandemic response may be highly dependent on these pers ons being in place to maintain key community ser vices. Each F/ P/T and local plan will need to determine their own priorities, but they ar e likely to include: \u0089 Police \u0089 Fire-fighters \u0089 The armed forces \u0089 Key emergency response decision makers (e.g. elected officials, essential government workers and disaster services personnel) \u0089 Utility workers (water, gas, electricity a nd essential communicati ons systems) \u0089 Funeral service/mortuary personnel \u0089 Personnel who work with institutionalized populations \u0089 Persons who are employed in public transporta tion and the transportation of essential goods (such as food) It is expected that all ser vices will need to deve lop pandemic influenza conti ngency plans to deal with worker absenteeism and illness. All services will need to change priorities for service delivery during the pandemic - not all services currently pr ovided would be considered essential d uring the pandemic. Table A-12: Essential Servi ce Wo rker Estim ates Essential Service Work ers Estimate Police (local/provincial) Firefighters (include volunteer firefighters) Armed forces Key emergency response decision makers Municipal/local government emergen cy services committee m embers Utility workers Water Natural gas Propane Electricity Essential co mmunicatio n systems Funeral service/mortuary personnel Personnel who work with institutionalized populations including workers at provincial jails (note: feder al corrections employees will be included in the federal government ess ential workers vaccine distribution plan) Public transit workers (need to define on a commu nity basis) Persons involved in the transportation of essential goods (such as food) Version 3 August 2005 74 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex A Non-Essential Service Workers (for consideration during a vaccination program) Estimate Clergy Social Service Agencies workers (e.g., soup kitchens ) Meals on Wheels workers Provincial vaccine depot workers and those transp orting vaccine Version 3 August 2005 75 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex A APPEND IX A-5: A NTIVIRA L PRIOR ITY GR OUPS Antivirals will likely be the only virus-s pecific in tervention during the initial pandemic response given that vaccine is unlikely to be una vailable in the early months of a pandemic. Current supplies of antivirals both within and outside of Canada are limited. The following priority groups for the use of anti-inf luenza drugs in times of short supply should be used for planning purpose s during the inter-pandemic period. The following groups, in descending order of priori ty, are offered as planning guidance but will need to be re-examined at the time of a pandemic al ert when epidemiological data about the pandemic virus is available. Table A-13: Antiviral Priority Group Estim ates Antiviral Priority Group Estimate 1. Persons hospitalized for influenz a. Rationale: those who ar e hospitalized within the first 48hours of onset of illness should be highest priority for t reatment (see Annex B, table B-2 ) 2. Ill health care and emergency services workers. Rationale: considering the essential role that these groups will h ave in the pandemic response, influenza cases that are identified within the first 48 hours of ons et of illness should be high priority for treatment. 3. Ill high-risk persons in the community. Rationale: persons with underlying heart and lung conditions or those who are immunocompromised, who present to ambulatory settings within 48 hours of onset of symptoms are at high risk for complications (see Annex B, table B-2 ). 4. Health ca re workers (prophylaxis) Rationale: until an effective vaccine b ecomes avail able HCWs are essential to the pand emic response plan and for the care of patients (s ee Appendix A-3). 5. High-risk reside nts of institutions (e.g. nursing homes) Rationale: to control outbreaks and reduce heal th care demand s. 6. Emergen cy & essential service workers (prophylaxis) Rationale: to minimize s ocietal disruption by mai ntaining key community services (see Appendix A-4 ). 7. High-risk persons hospitalized for illnes ses other than infl uenza (prophylaxis) Rationale: will be at higher risk of ac quiring in fluenza in hospital. 8. High-risk persons in the community (proph ylaxis) Rationale: a group likely to experience severe illness (see Annex B, table B- 3). The mass prophylaxis of children to control a pandemic is currently not recommended. Version 3 August 2005 76 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex B ANNEX B: ESTIMATING HEALTH IM PAC TS In an influenza pandemic, the BCCDC estimates that between 2 0% and 50% of the population may become infected, and that 15% to 35% of the popula tion wou ld become cl inically ill such that they would be unable to atten d work or other activities for at least one and a half a days. The rate of outpatient vi sits is estimated at 40 to 400 per 1,000 people, the r ate of hospitalizations is estimated at 0.2 to 13 per 1,000 people, and the rate of death is estimated at 0.014 to 7.65 per 1,000 pe ople (www.cd c.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no5/meltzer.htm ). This means that in BC during the next pandemic: \u0089 More than three million people w ill be infected with the virus. \u0089 As many as 1.8 million p eople will become clinically ill. \u0089 Up to 610,000 people will visit a health care provider. \u0089 Approximately 18,500 pe ople will need hospital care. \u0089 As many as 6,800 people will die fro m influenza and related complications. These estimates are based not on a worst-case scenario, but on the impact of the 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics, which were relatively mild compared with the 1918 pandemic. There is no way to predict th e severity of the next pan demic. To calculate the regional pandemic im pact, use th e tables below (Table B-1 and Table B-2) and follow these steps: 1. Table B-1, Column 1: Enter your region's age- stratified population into col umn 1 of Table B-1. Express the number s in 1,000s (e.g. 100,000 expressed in 1,000s is 100). 2. Table B-1, C olumns 2 & 3: Calculate low and hi gh estimates of the numbers of high-risk person in each age group using the following percentages: \u0089 0-19 years: 6% to 11% of age group. \u0089 20-64 years: 14% to 25% of the age group. \u0089 65+ years: 40% to 55% of the total po pulation in this age group. 3. Table B-1, C olumns 4 & 5: Calculate low and high estimates of the numbers of other persons (e.g. non-high-risk) in each ag e group by subtracting the low and hi gh estimates of high-risk individuals from the total population in each age group. For exam ple, for the low estimate for 0-19 year olds (column 4), subtract col umn 3 from column 1. 4. Table B-2, Column 3 & 4: Use the rates per 1,000 population (columns 1 & 2) and multiply these by the low and high population estimates from Table B-1 to estimate regional impact. Note that these are popul ation-based estimates and do not tak e into accou nt individuals who live in one area but travel to ano ther to visit a family phy sician or to receive hospita l or other care. For example, many people who live outside of Vanc ouver work in Vancouver and therefore have Vancouver-based physicians. Likewise , Vancouver has a greater number of tertiary care ho spitals (including BC Children's Hospital) and so the bu rden borne by Vancouver may be disproportionate to their popu lation. This should be considered in regional plans as possible and as appropriate.

Version 3 August 2005 81 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex C C.1. Provincial Coordination The Provinc e of British Columbia has adopted the British Columbia Emer gency Respo nse Management System (BCERMS). BCERMS is a comprehensive management system based upon the Incident Command S ystem (ICS) that ensur es a coordinated and organized response and recovery to a ll emergency incidents an d disasters. It provides the framework for a standardized emergency r esponse in BC. For more information, see Overview: \u0089 Use the all-hazards appro ach to devel op an emergency man agement framework to plan for and respond to pandemic influenza (see below). \u0089 Define the r oles, responsibilities and location of community resources, such as police, fire, public works and emergency social ser vices. \u0089 Maintain current telepho ne and e-mai l Emerge ncy Operation C entre (EOC ) lists, including local and regional acute care hospitals' emerge ncy departments and local mu nicipal/regional district emer gency planners. \u0089 Update EOC telephone numbers, cellular phone numbers, fax numbers, satellite phone numbers and e-mail addresses on a yearly basis. \u0089 Periodically update public health emergency callout list(s). \u0089 Periodically update acute care hos pital administrator on-call list (s). \u0089 Adapt existi ng disaster management forms to reflect pandemic influenza incident issues. \u0089 Meet various times throu ghout each ye ar to update emergency plan(s). \u0089 Include municipal and/or regional district re presentatives in the planning process. \u0089 Develop plans for demobilization after the emerg ency. C.3. Planning and Operati onalizing the Plan As indicated in the main body of the BC Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan, it is recommend ed that the following command and contr ol guidelines be used when planning for and responding to a Pandemic. This adaptati on of the Hospital Emergency Inciden t Command System (HEI CS) is presently used in many facilities as part of an \"a ll hazards\" approach to dealing with large-scale emergencies and disasters. If not already in place, once implemented, this system will help streamline organizational planning and response to large-scale emergencies and disasters. The system can be applied to all hazard s, including an influenza pandemic. The recomm ended guidelines identify several of the functions necessary wh en planning for a pandemic. T hink of the boxes in the planning organizational chart as \"functions\" that do not necessarily require one person for each position. Depending on the size of your area an d the resources available one person may take on several functions, conversely, some of the functions may require more than one individual. Version 3 August 2005 82 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex C Organizational Structure The organizational structu re (illustrated in Figure C-2 ) shows a chain of command which incorporates four sections (Logistics, Planning, Fina nce, Operati ons) under overall leadership of an Emergency Operations Centre (EO C) Director. As required, each of the four sections has a Chief appointed by the EOC Di rector. The Chiefs, when required, appoint leaders to sub-functions fillin g various crucial roles. This structure limits the span of control of each position/function in an attemp t to di stribute the work. It is strongly recommended that th e Health Author ity BC Emer gency Respo nse Management System (HABCERMS) be utilized as a planning an d response management system for various types and magnitudes of emergency even ts. The organizati onal chart adapted fro m HEICS and BCERMS as a guide to assist in planning for a nd responding to an influe nza pandemic. It was developed by John Hill , Emergency Disas ter Manage r, Vanco details. See http://www.emsa.ca. gov/Dms2/heics3.htm for the latest version of the HEICS. C.4.

Intro duction In the event of an influen za pandemic, there may be a requirement to quickly mobilize public health resources to provide vaccine or antivirals to larg e numbers of people. Influenza vaccinati on has long been considered the cornerstone of influenza pr evention and control and will also serve as the central preventive strateg y during the next pandem ic. In a pandemic the aim is to vaccina te the entire population over a period of four months, on a prioritized basis. Previous experience with outbreak related immunization clinics indicates th at it would be prudent to p repare for an initial demand of 75% of the target population. The most effective method for achieving this goal and meeting the demand to the greatest extent possible is to offer mass influenza immuniza tion clinics, which allow the immunization of a large numb er of people over a short time period. Health Authorities are responsible for planning an d implementing mass immunization clinics in their respective geographical catchment areas . This is not a new con cept to public health and is a method commonly u sed to deliver large quantities of vaccine in response to outbreaks . Some Health Authorities will have more experience than others in mass immunization. This Annex provides detailed guidelin es for pla nning and conducting mass influenza immunization clinics. Other methods of administering influenz a vaccine may also be utilized during a pandemic. These guidelines can also be applied to the admini stration of antivirals in a mass delivery situation, although this will be undertaken under very limited circumstances. D.2. Mass Clinic Preparation Planning fo r Mass Cli nics Planning fo r mass clinics will be based on the following expectations: \u0089 The target population for vaccination will be ex panded far beyond the typical high-risk groups to encompass, ideally, the entir e population. \u0089 It is likely that vaccine shortages will exist, especially during the early phases of the pandemic. Consideration must be given to fl exibilit y in planning for (a) severe vaccine shortages, (b) moderate v accine shorta ges, and (c) no shortages. Provincial Responsibil ities Provincial re sponsibilities include setti ng the vacci ne priority groups (see Appendix A-2 ) and the priority order. The list will be subject to chan ge, potentially on s hort notice, depending on the epidemiology and clinical features of the pandem ic influenza strain. As well, circumstances may require the addition of specific groups of people in areas where absences due to influenza illness could pose serious consequences in terms of publ ic safety or disruption of essential com munity services (e.g. air traffic controllers at major airports). Version 3 August 2005 92 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex D Specific antiviral priority groups (see Appendix A-5 ). This list may be subject to change for the reasons listed above. \u0089 Procure the vaccine and antiviral supply. \u0089 Distribute th e vaccine an d antivirals and set guidelines for its use. \u0089 Set guidelines for security of storage and transport of vaccine an d antivirals. \u0089 Set up a system for documentation/ tracking and evaluation. \u0089 Determine h ow many do ses of vaccine are needed. \u0089 Determine minimum qualifications/skills fo r immunizers. \u0089 Prepare education and co mmunicatio n materials for the various stakeholders in multiple languages, as appropriate and as possible. Health Authority Responsibilities Leadership: \u0089 Establish a p roject leader and a project team, with clear roles and responsibilities (see Appendix D-2 ) Vaccine/Anti viral Issues: \u0089 Calculate local vaccine/antiviral nts required based on population (see Annex B ) and priority groups (see App endices A-2, A-3, A-4 & A-5). \u0089 Calculate all support and requirements for obtaini ng vaccine and antivirals including vaccine storage, cold chain, security, trans port, and disposal within the r egion. \u0089 Set consent policy for immunization/ antiviral use including response to refusals from health care workers and first responders. \u0089 Establish co ntingency pl an(s) for tho se individuals showing up at the clinic who do not qualify for vaccine/antivirals (i.e. cross border issu es and/or ineligible). \u0089 Establish a p lan for the management o f adverse events. \u0089 Establish plans to vaccinate priority groups with in hard-to-reach populations, e.g. those with language or cultural barriers, the homeless, and those with mental illness. Site Selection: \u0089 Determine the number of facilities re quired to implement mas s clinics, and where they can/will be located (consi deration to geographic areas, bus routes, size, etc.). \u0089 Establish special transportation arrangements for those with physical disabilities, the frail elderly and for those with transportation difficulties. Supplies/Equi pment: \u0089 Determine the supplies and equipmen t Appendix D-1 ). \u0089 Identify available suppliers. \u0089 Plan for bio-medical waste management. Version 3 August 2005 93 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex D Staffing: \u0089 Determine what programs will be suspended during the pandemic, and ther efore whether additional staff will be available. \u0089 Identify potential staff (medical person nel, volu nteers, translators and security staff) within your organization who wi ll be reassigned/recrui ted to assist with mass clinics (data bas e recommended). \u0089 Establish a centralized staff scheduling pr ocess and rapid recall system (d ata base recommended) which incl udes a conti ngency plan for when personnel become ill. \u0089 Identify staff training needs around mass immunization. Documentation: \u0089 Set up a system for documentation/ tracking and evaluation of vaccine/anti viral uptake, vaccine supp lies, and adverse events. Communicatio n: \u0089 Develop a communicati ons plan re: mass clinics and key spokespersons. \u0089 Determine the necessary information and supplie s needed, e.g. clinic information/poster s, pamphlets, consents, tran slations, etc. \u0089 Consider establishing an information hotline and regularly updated websi tes. \u0089 Update NurseLine with cl inic times an d locations. Mass Immuni zation Plan Training: \u0089 The plan should be reviewed by pers onnel likely to hold the clinic coordination positions; should be exercised periodically, and necessary upd ates and a mendments put into action. \u0089 Establish evaluation components for the post pand emic period. \u0089 Include training for security personnel in ha ndling desperate and /or emotional people. D.3. Mass Clinic Operations Facilities The size and type of facilities needed f or mass in fluenza immunization clinics will vary depending on the number of persons to be served. Examples of central locations are local school auditoriums, arenas (with out ice), community cen ter gymnasiu ms, churches and temples, and shopping malls. Necessary amenities include bathrooms, open areas, near bus routes, familiar locations for public, parking capacity and poss ible refrigera tion.

Version 3 August 2005 101 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex E ANNEX E: HEALTHCARE SERV ICE PLAN NING PR INCIPL ES Much of the inf ormation in thi s Annex comes from the CD C, Guidelines f or Utilization of Non-Traditional Settings for Delivery of Medical Care During an In fluenza Pandemic - dr aft 03/23/000 , p. 15-18. E.1. Intro duction During a pandemic or other medical emergency, th e province a nd health authorities may have to call on many add itional resources to meet the increased need for medical care. The province or region may need additional health care be ds or facilities, additional pers onnel and other resources. This Annex outlines the genera l planning principles and actions required to deter mine possible needs and the best m eans of meetin g those need s. The agency, authority or facility will appoint an individual or task force (depending on the complexities of the jurisdiction(s) involved) to coor dinate and o versee the development a nd implementa tion of the guidelines. Use an ethical decision making model to prioritize allocation of resources and patient care. E.2. Assessment of Facility Bed Capaci ty Conduct an assessment of each facility currently in use (see Appendix E-2 ). For each site determine the factors which limit patient care. T hese might include: \u0089 Emergency department capacity. \u0089 Number of beds. \u0089 Number of intensive care unit beds. \u0089 Quantity of ventilators. \u0089 Space - to separate beds. \u0089 Space and ca pacity to s eparate by gen der or age. \u0089 Ceiling heigh t, ventilation systems. \u0089 Transportation of patients, staff and public. \u0089 Storage capa city including pharmacy. \u0089 Water and sewage service. \u0089 Disposal/storage of medical waste. \u0089 Kitchen facilities. \u0089 Facilities to lodge and feed staff. \u0089 Morgue capacity. Suppl ies Equipment will be scarce during the pandemic, an d unlikely to be stockpiled beforehand. Sharing between agencies may occur at the local level bu t cannot be dep ended on as a resource o ption. Version 3 August 2005 102 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex E Therefore, it is important to complete and main tain a listing of inventory within each of the facilities. \u0089 Identify medications that will be used for trea tment of influenza complications during t he pandemic. Develop stra tegies for securing these during a pandemic. \u0089 Address supply chain and transportation i ssues fo r staff, equip ment and supplies. \u0089 Determine existing equipment which wo uld be used in the pan demic, such as: y Hospital bed s, ICU beds. y Ventilators. y Ready suppl y or contingency supplies of antibiotics, antiviral agents, needles, syringes. y Bronchodilators. y Oxygen and oxygen equipment. y Blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, p ulse oximeters. y Hand washing solution, gloves, masks bedding. y Body bags and burial supplies. Work with the federal/provincial governments to prioritize and allocate bu lk purchased equipment and supplies. Source of Supply Identify sources of extra supplies need ed to provide health care. \u0089 Identify supply chain and transportation issues. \u0089 Conduct a community-wide space and site re source inventory in conjunction with community emergency pl anning representatives. \u0089 Determine the availability of shelters, schools, gymnasiums, nursing homes, daycare centers, and other po tential sites f or aggregate care. \u0089 Determine l ocation and availability of vacant la nd for possible mobile hospital installations. \u0089 Make arrangements with owners of each facili ty to use the site, if necessary, to care for ill persons during a pandemic. \u0089 Conduct an i nventory of health care personnel including current and retired MDs, RNs and other nursing personnel, veterinarians, others with medical train ing and other potential volunteers. \u0089 Determine s ources from which additi onal staff could be redeployed or acqu ired during a pandemic, e. g. retired healthcare providers, students and allied disciplines. Assessment of Pandemic Impact \u0089 Estimate the number of out-patient v isits and hospitalizations that could be expected du ring a pandemic a nd determin e the extent to which heal th care organizations might be overwhelmed (see Annex B). \u0089 Estimate the shortage of staff in health serv ices and develop strategies to mi nimize the impact. Consider staff sh ortages due to illness, sick children, lack of childcare, death. Version 3 August 2005 103 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex E Security Issues Plans need to be made to secure the contents of lo cal health care facilities. Due to limited supplies and equipment during the pandemic, their protecti on from theft and vandalism will be paramount. Plans should be made to ensure that: \u0089 Each heal th care facility has security s ervices or local police to protect again st loss of equipment, medical supp lies and drugs during the pandemic. \u0089 Secure stora ge area(s) are designated for supplies/drugs/equipment. \u0089 Transportation routes to and from health care facil ities remain unobstructed. Care Guidelines \u0089 Develop co mmunity-wide guidelines regarding what type of care could be provided at each site and what will trigger a ctivation of these sites. \u0089 Designate an individual to oversee the care pr ovided in each traditional and non-traditional setting. The type of perso n selected fo r each site m ay vary based on the typ e of care provided. This person should monitor patient flow, maintain a log of patient activity including patient outcom e, and monitor availability of supplies. \u0089 Determine how triage will be managed . \u0089 Establish provisions for referral to other health care services. \u0089 Follow infec tion control procedures outlined in Annex I . \u0089 Define the extent of care that ea ch type of provider can perform according to law/collective agreements, scope of practice and pro fessional standards. \u0089 Ensure that health care p roviders' liability pro tection extends to providing care and serv ice in all settings. E.3. Pandemi c Impact on Staffing Assess the I mpact The pandemic will have a profound affect on staffi ng, as many more health care workers will be required, but many will be ill or caring for family members who are ill.

Version 3 August 2005 106 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex E APPEND IX E- 2: HOSPITAL BED CA PACITY The following worksheets have been d eveloped to assi st health authorities and facilities in planning for an influe nza pandemic. They can be used to compliment centralized bed management systems, or can be used on their own to evaluate bed capacity and achieve ma ximum bed utilization. As well as the maximum number of beds available, facilities should determine the hours of care needed to s taff those beds. Advance pla nning should be in place for the likely change in bed acuity. The estimates from these worksheets can be used in generating FluSurge estimates (s ee Appendix B- 1).

These include mortuary services, BC NurseLine and other sources of information, Public Health Units and walk-in medical clinics. Mortuary Services During a pandemic, local authorities will have to be prepared to manage additional deaths due to influenza, over and above the number of fata lities from all causes expected d uring the inter- pandemic period. Within any locality, the total numb er of fatalities (including influenza and all other causes) occu rring during a 6- to 8-week pandemic wave is esti mated to b e similar to that which typically occurs over six months in th e inter-pandemic period. The Canadia n Pandemic Plan has guidelines to ass ist local planners and funeral directors in preparing to cope with lar ge-scale fatalities due to an influenza pandemic. A number of issues have been identified, which sh ould be reviewed with cor oners/medical examiners, local authorities, funeral directors, and religious groups/authorities. See the Can adian Pandemic Influenza Plan, Annex I ( http://www.ph ac-aspc.gc.ca/cpip-pclcpi/pdf-cpip-03/cpip-appendix-i.pdf ) for more information. BC NurseLine BC NurseLine provides health information and a dvice offered through a toll-free (within BC) telephone line. The lines are staffed by register ed nurses 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A pharmacist is also available 5 p.m. to 9 a.m., 7 days a week. NurseLine should expect incr eased usage of their services in the event of the pandem ic as people call about thei r symptoms, about self- care options and for advice regarding visiting health care practiti oners. BC HealthGuideOnline and BC HealthFiles are on-lin e sources of information on health topics that can be publi cized to assis t the public manag ement of symptoms (http://www.bchealthguide.org/kbaltindex.asp ). A hard copy version of BC HealthGuid e is available at no charge to all BC residents. Public Health Units Public Health Units can expect increas ed inquiries about vaccina tion and trea tment. If th e Unit conducts immunization clinics, the volume of pati ents will be much higher during an influenza pandemic than is usual during inter-p andemic influenza seasons. Walk-In Me dical Clinics Walk-in medical clinics are treatm ent centres that operate on a fi rst-come, first-served basis and do not require an appointment with the physician. During an influenza pand emic, walk-in clinics should expect increased v olume, both from people infected with the influenza virus, and from people suffering from in fluenza-like illness. This is in addition to the usual patient caseload.

Intro duction The health authorities, local governments, local firs t responder agencies (e.g. police, fire), emergency social services, emergency health services, and lo cal non-governmental organizations all have roles and responsibilities in terms of developing and supporting these local emergency response plans. F.2. Health Authority Roles and Responsibilities for Munici pal/Local Pandemi c Influenza Planning a nd Response \u0089 The health a uthority, under the leader ship of the Medical Heal th Officer (MHO) is responsible for developing a Pand emic Influenza Contingency Plan. \u0089 The health authority, though the MHO, will take the lead in providing advice and counsel to local governments' emer gency services. \u0089 The MHO will take whatever steps are reas onably possible to suppress the disease and protect th e public as described in the Health Act . \u0089 Whenever possible, the MHO will provide st aff to the local government Emergency Operations Centre(s) (E OC). \u0089 In the event of staff and resource shortages, regional staff will b e access ed through the health autho rity EOC. Municipalities and regional districts within a health authority should develop consequence management guidelines and procedures for health emergencies. The purpose of these guidelines is to enable local government(s), working in conjunction with the health autho rities to maintain the continuity of essential ser vices and support to resi dents. Local government all-hazard emergency response plans will provide general guidance.

Version 3 August 2005 154 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex H ANNEX H: OVER VIEW OF FEDERAL ROLES AND RESPON SIBILITIES Meeting the challenge of an influenza pandemic wi ll require co-operative efforts between the federal and provincial governments. This overview of roles and responsibilities includes both federal responsibilities and national efforts which w ill be coordinated by federal agencies. Along with specific federal preparedness and respons e planning activities, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is to s upport and ensure federal, provincial and territorial (F/P/T) collaboration in the develo pment of the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan and other necessary preparedness activities. This will be achieved by forming, supp orting and maintaining an F/P/T com mittee and necessary working groups. This is being accomplishe d by the activities of the Pandemic Influenza Committee (PIC) and its Working Groups. The mandate of the PIC includes providing ad vice, expertise and recommend ations, liaison and other activiti es associated with the pre-pandemic, pandemic and post-pandemic phases to support the health an d safety man dates of all levels of government. Wher e there is a n eed for F/P/T collaboration in developing plans and guidelines, PIC has been delegated the responsibility to ensure that plans ar e developed. PIC's specific roles an d responsibilities are established and its mandate is described in the F/P/T Memorandum of Unders tanding. This comprehensive list of federal as well as join t federal, provincial and ter ritorial roles and responsibilities is drawn from the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan ( www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/cpip- pclcpi/ ). In general the roles and responsibilities of the respective jurisdictions are as follows: \u0089 The federal government is responsible for the nationwide coordination of the pandemic influenza response, including surveillance, internati onal liaison, and coordination of the vaccine resp onse (infrastructure procurement, vaccine allocation, management and funding). \u0089 Joint responsibilities of t he F/P/T MOHs include ensuring dis tribution of plans to all organizations that may be involved in the pandemi c response and liaison with these partners on an ongoing basis. They may also be involved in planning simulation exercises once plans are in place. Development of cost estimates and options for decision makers will also be a joint F/P/T responsibility. \u0089 The P/Ts are responsibile for mobilizing their contingency plans and resources. Health emergency r esponse commences at the local level and escalates through P/Ts to the fed eral order of government. \u0089 Local public health authorities are responsible for planning the local response to an influenza pandemic wi th direction from both th e P/T and federal level. This involves liaising with local partner s (e.g., emergency respon ders, hospitals, mortuary services) in advance of a pandemic to facilitate a coordinated respons e when pandemic influenza strikes in the community. It is likely that the local public heal th authorities, through existing or enhanced surveillance, may be the first ones to d etect influe nza in their community. It is essential that the lines of communicati on within th e community and up the li ne to the P/ T and federal levels are clear and establi shed in advance of a pan demic. Version 3 August 2005 155 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex H The Pand emic Influenza Com mittee The PIC is a F/P/T committee that first met by tel econference in March 2002. It is co-chaired by two individuals representing the federal and the provincial/territorial governments. The PIC is supported by the CIDPC and reports through th e Advisory Committee on Population Health and Health Secur ity (ACPHH S) to the F/ P/T Deputy Mi nisters of Health during the pre-pandemic period. It is anticipated that PIC will report directl y to the F/P/T Ministers of Heath at s uch time when PIC is asked to con sult on a real, actual or perceived threa t of pandemi c influenza. The PIC would contin ue to report to said F/P/T Minister s of Health until such time as the threa t or influenza pandemic is declared over. The mandate of the PIC includes providing ad vice, expertise and recommend ations, liaison and other activiti es associated with the pre-pandemic, pandemic and post-pandemic phases to support the health and safety mandates of all orders of government. PIC will also provide advice, assistance and expertise concerning the developm ent, mainten ance, testing and evaluatio n of the Can adian Pandemic Influenza Plan, and when requested to d o so, any P/T contingency plan.

Version 3 August 2005 160 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex I ANNEX I: INFEC TION CONTROL GUIDE LINES FOR PAN DEMIC INFLUENZA MANAGEMENT During an influenza pand emic, adherence to inf ection control practices is ex tremely imp ortant to prevent trans mission of influenza. These guidelin es for the management of pandemic influenza in traditional an d non-traditional health care setti ngs are based on published guidelines from the Population and Public Health Branch of the Publ ic Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Com mittee. The web sites an d ordering instructions for these resou rces are at the end of th is annex. I.1. Mode of Transmission Influenza is transmitted b y: \u0089 Droplet contact of the or al, nasal or conjunctival muco us membran es with the oropharyngeal secretions of an infected individual. \u0089 Indirect contact from han ds and articles freshly soiled with discharges of the nose and thr oat of an acutely ill individual. \u0089 Droplet tran smission from the respira tory tract of an infected i ndividual. \u0089 Possibly by the airborne route (con troversial) during aerosolizing procedures. Incubation and Period of Communicability: period of 1-3 days. \u0089 Influenza is communicab le for 24 hours before onset of sympto ms and 3-5 days after ons et of symptoms (may be lon ger in children and some adults). Note: Influenza A and B can survive on hard surfaces for 24-48 hours, on softer (porous) surfaces for 8-12 hours, and on the hands for up to 5 minutes. I.2. Basic Guid elines/Stra tegies Most health care settings use similar systems of Infection Contr ol Precautions, but may call them different names, e.g., body substance precautions , universal precautions or standard precautions. These systems may vary slightly from area to area but the guiding principles are the sam e. The term Routine Practices will be used in this document when referring to Infection Control Precautions. To assist with communication and co nsistency in applying the evidence bas ed precautio ns, it is recommended that each region/area attempt to develop a stand ard system o f Infection Control Precautions that can be used through all phases of the pandemic influenza planning. Version 3 August 2005 161 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex I The Public Health Agen cy of Canada provides two guidelines: (to obtain co pies, see resources at end of this section): 1. Routine Practic es and Additional Precautions for Preven ting the Transmissi on of Infection in Health Care has current infection con trol recomm endations for acute care; long term care and ambulatory care facilities and home care. It also provides tools to assist in the implementa tion of these p ractices. 2. Infection Control Guidelines for Hand Washing, Cleani ng, Disinfection and Sterilizatio n in Health Care has recomm endations for hand washing, gloves , cleaning and processing of patient care equipment, h ousekeeping, laundry and waste m anagement. I.3. Routine P ractices an d Additio nal Precau to Prev ent the Tra nsmission of Influenza Pre-Pandemic Phase During the inter-pandem ic years, Public Health Ag ency of Cana da guidelines recommend routine practices for the care of al l patients with the a dditio n of droplet and conta ct precautions for adults presenting with acute respiratory illness and pediat ric patients. Children and adults, who have the physical and cognitive abilities, should be encour aged to practice good hand hygiene and good personal hygiene. Routine Practic es: Routine practices are th e infection prevention and control practices used in the routine ca re of all patients a t all times in all health care s ettings. Routine practices emphasize the importan ce of hand washing; the need to use g masks/eye protecti on/face shields, and gowns when spla shes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions are possible. These sa me precautio ns should be taken wh en cleaning patient-care eq uipment, the environment, soiled linen, waste disp osal, and during patient placement. These routine practi ces reduce the possibility of HCW exposure to blood borne patho gens and oth er infectious pathogens. Additional p recautions ar e required when rout ine practices are not sufficient to prevent transmission. Droplet precautions: Droplet precautions include the use of personal pr otective equi pment, such as mask, goggles/face shield when providing ca re, placing the patient in a private room or cohorting the patient with another patient with influenza. Dropl et precautions should be practiced dur ing any procedure that may result in aerosolization, e.g., respiratory in tubations, bronchoscopy, cardio-pulmonary arrest management. Version 3 August 2005 162 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex I Contact Precautions Contact precautions include: wearing gloves and gowns when pr oviding care to the patient and when in contact with freq uently touch ed environmental surfaces or objects that may b e contaminated, placing the patient in a private room or cohorting the patient with another patient with influenza. Droplet and contact precautions ar e described in Routine Practices and Addi tional Precautions for Preventing the Transmission of Infection in Health Care for each of the hea lth care settings. Hand Hygiene Hand hygiene is an important step in p reventing the spread of infectious diseases, including influenza. Hand hygiene procedures using soap/wa ter or alcohol based hand rubs are outlined in Appendix 3 of Annex F ( http://www. phac-aspc.gc.ca/cpip-pc lcpi/pdf-cpip-03/cpip-appendix- f.pdf) in the Canadian Pandemic Influenza adherence to hand wash ing/hand antise psis recommenda tions is the cornerstone of infection pr evention and control and may be th e only preventive measure available during a pandemic. Note: The in fluenza virus is readily inactivated by h ospital germicides, household cleaning products, soap, hand wash or hand hygiene products. Therefore, neither antiseptic hand hygiene products in health care s ettings nor antibacterial h and hygien e products in home setting s are required because regular products, when u sed correctly will inactivate the influenza virus. Patient Plac ement If possible, patients with i nfluenza or influenza- like symptoms s hould be separated from patients without symptoms. In order of preference ill patients should be: \u0089 Placed in a single room. \u0089 Cohorted in a semi-private room. \u0089 Cohorted in a ward room. \u0089 Separated by at least on e meter in oth er locations (avoid crowding). Other Activities to Limit Spread of Influenza Staff working with symptomatic pati ents should avoid working with patien ts who are n ot symptomatic, as much as possible (staff cohort). This can be accomplished as follows: \u0089 Attempt to r earrange staffing assignments to acco mmodate as many of the same staff as possible working with symptomatic r esidents \u0089 Keep symptomatic pati ents in room until sympto ms cease \u0089 Limit movement/activities of patients in cluding transfers within the facility \u0089 Avoid group activities Version 3 August 2005 163 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex I Pandemic Phase Routine practices and add itional preca utions to prevent the tran smission of infection during a pandemic ar e important. Some infection control strategies may be achievabl e only in the early phases of the pandemic and other recommendations may not be achievable as the pandemic spreads and resources (equipment, supplies, priva te rooms, and workers) become scarce. The complex ity of management of high-risk patien ts will be greatest in acute care hospitals where patients with other respiratory communicable diseas es will also continue to be admitted. Therefore, infection co ntrol resources may need to be prioritized to th e acute care setti ngs. Mask Use During an Influenza Pandemic* (*Refers to surgical masks, not special masks or respirators) There is a lack of evidence that the us e of masks has prevented the transmis sion of influenza during previous pandemics. Masks may be useful in the early phase in the acut e care hospital during face-to-face conta ct with coughing individuals, especially when i mmunizatio n and antivirals are not yet available. The use of masks is not practical or h elpful when transmission has entered the communi ty. However , masks should be worn by health care workers for other known or suspected respi ratory communicable diseases. Masks should be worn by HCWs as outlined in routine practices when splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions to the muco us membranes of the mouth are possible or as described under contact d roplet precau tions. A part iculate respirator (N95 mask) is required for organisms spread by the airborne route, e.g. TB, m easles, chickenpox, and during aerosolizing procedures with patients suspected or known to h ave organisms spread by d roplet transmission. Public Health Restriction s and Public Gatherings The Medical Health Officer has the au thority un der the Commu nicable Disease Regulations of the Public Health Act to institu te community-based infection control measures such as: \u0089 Closure of community facilities (e. g. schools, community centers) \u0089 Cancellation of group eve nts Medical Heal th Officers should work together to d evelop a predetermined s trategy for closing public gatherings. If public gatherings are restricted , they should be restricted early enough to affect disease trans mission. The strategy sho uld include (but is not limited to): \u0089 The definition of what co nstitutes a p ublic gathering. \u0089 Specifying the time perio d within the pandemic str ategy to impl ement th e strategy. \u0089 Applicability and consistency across jurisdictions. \u0089 Availability a nd priority use of vaccine and antivirals. Version 3 August 2005 164 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex I \u0089 Considerations as to whether school aged children are included in the high priority for immunizatio n or antivirals in the early phase of the pandemic.

The majority of illnesses and death will tend to occur over a six to eight week period in any locality. Consequently, the number of outpatient vi sits and hospitalizations will rise well b eyond our current capa city. Estimates of the hea lth and econ omic impact of a pandemic in Canada and British Columbia have been performed using a model dev eloped by M eltzer and colleagues, CDC Atlanta (see Annex B). Due to the large number of patients who will require medical services during an influenza pandemic, communities and healthca re organizations must put in place guidelines to follow if/when healthcare organizations are overwhelmed. The use of non-traditional sites (NT sites) f or the provision of medical care and the need for additional human reso urces must be considered as strong possibilities and planned for accordingly. Human Resource issues must be addr essed when c onsidering plans for the use of non-traditional settings. HR planning should include: spectrum of practice for both HCWs and volunteers; staff mobility between sites a nd/or jurisdictions; co mpensation. J.2. Definition of a Non- Tradi tional Site (NT Site) A non-traditional site is a site that is: \u0089 Currently not an established healthcare site; or \u0089 Is an established healthca re site that u sually offers a different type or level of care. The functions of a non-traditional site will vary depending on the needs of the community but will focus on monitoring, care and support of influenza patients during an influenza pandemic. J.3. Use and Selection o f Non-Tradi tional Sites The role of any NT site will depend on the needs of the community and the resources available. It is expected tha t NT sites wi ll be used during the pandemic for several purposes: \u0089 Extensions of overloaded hospitals and clinics, for the care of influenza patients that are n ot critically ill or not well enough to return home. \u0089 Domiciliary care, for individuals unable to care for themselves at home. \u0089 Triage Settings: Upon de claration of the Pandem ic in BC, triage settings will be established to facilitate efficient and consistent assessment for those with influenza like illness. \u0089 Temporary Influenza Hospitals: Upon declaration of the Pandemic in BC, triage settings will be established to provide care for patients w ho are unable to be cared for at home and not ill enough for a n acute care hospital. Version 3 August 2005 166 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex J \u0089 Self Care Settings: Care is provided at hom e by family member s, neighbors, volunteers or individuals t hemselves. See the Can adian Pandemic Influenza Plan http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/cpip-pclcpi/pdf- cpip-03/cpip non-tra ditional setti ngs. The following issues should be considered when sel ecting a NT site: \u0089 Patients in these settings will either be ill with the pandemic strain of influen za or will have recovered from the pand emic strain o f influenza; thus patient to patient tra nsmission of influenza will not be a concern. \u0089 Care at NT sites should be limited to supporti ve or palliative care for influen za patients. Critical care would likely not be possi ble within these sites and should remain in acute ca re settings. \u0089 Persons with immunosuppressive illness or other communicable diseases (e. g. tuberculosis, chickenpox) should not be admitted to these sites. \u0089 In communities with a high proportion of elderl y or high risk persons, the role of the NT site may need to be expa nded to inclu de the provision of heath care services specifically related to dealing with the exacerbatio n of co-morbidities. J.4. Administrative Options for Non-Traditional Sites NT sites ma y be establis hed as a \"satellite site\" of an acute car e facility or other health care facility (also known as the parent organization), or as a \"free-standing site\". The \"satellite site\" model is advantageou s since it does not require establishment of a separate administr ative structur e. Linkage with an existing acute care facility or other he alth care facility would facilitate the following: \u0089 Prompt implementa tion o f an administrative structu re. \u0089 Ordering, tracking and maintenance o f equipment and supplies. \u0089 Implementa tion of record keeping and patient tra cking systems. \u0089 Implementa tion/establishment of nursing protocols and patient care guidelines. \u0089 Sharing of expertise and human resources between sites. \u0089 Access to ser vices such as sterilization, laborat ory services, pharmacy services, laundry, fo od services. \u0089 Establishment of triage, transfer and trans port agreements between the NT s ite and the affiliated health care facility or referral hospital. \u0089 Extension of liability, workers compen sation and other site insurance. Free-Standing Sites Where it is not possible to set-up a \"satellite site\" the establishment of \"free-standing sites\" will be necessary. Planning for t he administration of \"fr ee-standing sites\", including how the issues listed above will be dealt with at the site, will need to be completed du ring the inter-pandemic period. Version 3 August 2005 167 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex J Designating an Admi nistrator Regardless of the administrative structure of the site, an individual or team n eeds to be d esignated to oversee the care provided in each NT site. This person/team sh ould: \u0089 monitor pati ent flow, \u0089 maintain a lo g of patient activity including patient outcomes, an d \u0089 monitor availability of supplies. Delegation of these responsibilities to ensure ongoing and consistent admini stration of the site needs to be planned for in advance. J.5. National Emergency Stock pile System (N ESS) In the event of a pandemic, specific kits or units from the stockp ile could potentially be us ed to facilitate reception, intake, triage and provision of medical and social services at a NT site. The National Em ergency Stockpile System (NESS) was developed primarily for u se in crises such as natural disasters, earthquakes, or other emergencie s in which there is a sudden need for supplies and equipment to deal with a large number of people wi th varying medical need s. The program involves the purchase, packaging, shipping and storing of supplies and equipment organized into kits designed to meet specific emergency medical need s. The comp onents of th e kits are packaged and stored in warehouses across Canada to facilitate timely distribution. The NESS should no t be confused with provincial emergency stockpiles that may exist wi thin each pr ovince or territory. In the event of a local em ergency that overwh elms municipal resources, the municipality must contact the p rovincial/territorial emergency mana gement au thorities to access the NESS program. Release of eq uipment or supplies must then be coo rdinated through the Provincial/Territorial Ministry of Health Emer gency Management Bran ch, or Manager of Emergency Social Services Office. In certain cases the distribution of drugs is directed by the provincial Chief Medical Officers of Health. J.6. Pre-Pandemic (Inter-Pandemic) Period The following activities should take place during the inter-pandemic period. Review Emergency Legislation Emergency preparedness legislation makes many prov isions fo r the management of a crisis including obtaining and accessing materials and other resources , as well a s implementation of a crisis plan and a crisis management structure. Pandemic Planning should be integrated with the emergen cy plans of the jurisdiction in order to make best use of existing plans and resources. IMPORTANT NOTE Regional Pand emic Plans should not as sume that a National o r Provincial Emergency will be decla red, as this may not oc cur during a pa ndemic Version 3 August 2005 168 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex J Identify Triggers for Implementation Since it is unlikely that the pandemic will start in Canada, the first trigger for the consideration of establishing NT sites ma y be reports of the seve rity and epidemiology of the pandemic from other countries. This will likely be the first indicator of what to expect when the pandemic reaches Canada in terms of demand on tr aditional health services. Once the Provincial Health Officer has declared the pandemic in British Columbia, it will be up to each heal th authority and health care o rganization/ facility to activate its emergency health services plan which includes the establishment of NT sites. Assess Loc ations for P otential NT Sites It is strongly recommended that a multi-disciplin ary team approach be used to assess potential NT sites in a jurisdiction, to ensure suitability of a potential site. Ideally, the ass essment tea m (see Appendix J-1 ) should include: personnel, including fire and ESS; \u0089 health care p ersonnel, including public health, infection control, etc.; \u0089 engineering, maintenan ce, public works staff; and \u0089 others as required. Possible S ites This team sh ould conduct a community-wide space and site inventory to determine the lo cation and availability of potential sites for NT hospitals. This assessment s hould be repeated a t regularly scheduled intervals during the inter-pandemic peri od to ensure the identified sites remain suitable. Potential NT sites include, but are not limited and \u0089 daycare centers. For each location, assess the feasibility of its use and its role as a NT site based on the information below and th e intended u se for the facility. Locati ons which are not suitable for inpatient care may be considered for another purpose such as triage or education/counselling services. Because the agencies or companies which own these facilities must be aware of and may assist in this process, planners are encouraged to devel op and maintain relationships with school boards, religious organizations and community businesses. This will help to ensure a smooth transition if and when these facilities are required. Do not assum e that other agencies ma intain these relationships - contact your Health A uthority Emergency Planne r, local Emerge ncy Social Services, Ministry of Health Emerg ency Version 3 August 2005 169 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex J Management B ranch, Ministry of Health Services, Ministry of Education and others to determine what protocols or plans have been made to use l ocal facilities . Characteristics and Services Required for an I npatient Setting Each building under consideration for a NT si te mu st meet the National Building Code standards for its currently designated building type. Once bu ilding codes have been as sessed, the following issues need to be considered: \u0089 Adequacy of external facilities: y public access ibility (including public transport, parking, directions); y off-loading; y traffic control; y disabled access; and y other as needed. \u0089 Adequacy of internal space: y washrooms and sinks, amenities, function; y kitchen, refrigerator, dishes, dishwashing capability, food prep areas etc.; y secure space for administration/patient records; y space for reception, waiti ng, patient care, patient f amily educati on, counselling/support; y secure storage capability f or pharmacy and other su pplies; y mortuary spa ce (con tact local funeral directors); and y ability to mai ntain a 1 meter separation between inpatient beds. \u0089 Adequacy of critical support systems for site to provide patient care: y ventilation systems (adeq uate air flow, air conditioning, heating); y physical plan t/building engineering; y electricity - power for lighting, steriliz ers, refrigeration, food services; y natural gas supply - e.g., for heating or electricity o r cooking; y water supply; and y sanitation (including number of toilets, showers or washing facilities). \u0089 Arrangements to provide essential support services required for in-patient care: y security; services-trained and exper ienced personnel using certified equip ment should be responsible for sterilization of equipment. Appropriate arrangements for sterilization services e.g., with a hospital, may be required; y pharmaceuti cal services; y medical waste disposal/storage; y mortuary funeral services; y food services; and y facilities for staff lo dging and feeding. Version 3 August 2005 170 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex J Infection Control (See Annex I) \u0089 When planning for a NT site it is important to es tablish wheth er the site wi ll focus only on the care of influenza patients or whether other types of patients will be receiving services at these sites. I nfection control issues will be greater if transmission of influenza to other patients is a possibility. \u0089 All patients s hould be separated by a t least one m eter, as is the norm for patients with an y medical condition. \u0089 If non-in fluenza patients will be seen at th ese sites, separate waiting areas should be considered for potential influenza pati ents. \u0089 For NT sites focusing on influenza, there appears to be no infection contr ol basis for segregating p eople at various stages of illness. \u0089 In either situation healthcare workers and vi sitors to the site will need to be educated regarding appropriate infection contr ol practices. \u0089 Infection Control Guidelines for this setting can be found in the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan (Appendix J, Part C Sections 1 and 3). Security an d Safety \u0089 Safety of buildings will be based on the National B uilding Code and CSA Standards. \u0089 Security includes security of access, security of medications, an d the security of patients and staff. \u0089 Security mus t be consider ed in choosing sites as well as when planning staff needs. Plan for Cri tical Equipment and Suppl ies (Also see G eneral Health Service Planning Principles, Annex E ) \u0089 During the inter-pandem ic period planners should identify critical equipment and supplies necessary for the establish ment and op erations of NT sites. Sources of supplies need to be identified; expected needs during a pandemic and the ability to meet thos e needs should be discussed with all possible suppliers. Potential access to the NESS should also be addressed. \u0089 A pandemic will likely res ult in shortages of medications, medical supplies and potentially operational supplies. Since other jurisdiction - in cluding other countries - will potentially be affected by these shortages, the respo nse plan should NOT rely heavily on outside assistance in terms of the provision of supplies and equipment. Transportation and Supply Logistic s Each heal th authority and health care organization (facility) needs to plan how supplies will be managed. Transportation planning for NT sites should include considerati on of the typ es of supplies and products that will need to be transported to and from the NT sites, who will provide these services and wheth er the site has appropriate delivery access. Version 3 August 2005 171 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex J Stockpiling \u0089 Each region and local health authorities may wish to review the possibility of rotating stockpiles of supplies for NT sites within their own jurisdiction, e.g. beds, ventilators. An assessment s hould be ma de of the ma intenance an d training required to ensure the safety and effectiveness of any older equipment that is sto red. \u0089 Stockpiling o f antiviral drugs will be addressed on a national lev el. \u0089 The feasibility of stockpiling critical medications for the care and management of patients with influenza and second ary pneumonia should also be explored. Equipment and Supplie s (See other Annexes of this plan, and Annex J of the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan: http://www. phac-aspc.gc.ca/cpip-pclc pi/pdf-cpip-03/cpip-appendix-j.pdf ) The services offered at each NT site will dictate equipment and supply needs. The following is a preliminary list for NT s, bandages, steristrips, gloves, alcohol based hand sanitizers, alcohol sponges, gauze s ponges, arm boards, pulse oximeter, batteries, flashlights, scissors, tongue blades, portable lamps); \u0089 emergency d rugs; \u0089 airway supplies (masks, radio or alternatives for isolated comm unities); and \u0089 computer an d internet access. Plan for the Triage Process Triage is defined as a pro cess whereby a group of casualties or patients is sorted according to the seriousness of their illnes s or injuries, so that trea tment priorities can be allocated among them. In emergency si tuations it is designed to maximize th e number of survivors. In order to reduce dem and on hospital emergency de partments and, potentially, on family physicians and walk in clinics, it may be necessary to perfor m triage at NT sites during the pandemic. The use of such a system requires a significant public awareness campaig n since ill people tend to seek services fro m their usual healthcare providers. Designation of NT sites as triage centres specifically for influen za-like illness has the added advantage of potentially r educing exposure of other pa tients to influenza. It also ensures consistent Version 3 August 2005 172 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex J application of current recommendations through the use of patient care protocols and controls the number and type of other services, such as laboratory testing an d chest x-rays that are bei ng ordered.

This can result in several, simultaneous epidemics worldwide with large numbers of illnes s and death. The World Health Organization (WHO) experts are predicting that with the incr ease in global travel and goods, and with the increased nu mbers of people living in urban environments, wh en a new stra in of influenza emerges it will spread rapidly around the globe. Planning and preparation at all levels - provincial , regional, local and personal - is key to helping deal with an d mitigate th e effects of a pandem ic. However, pandemics pos e a unique set of problems, which distinguish them from other types of emergencies: y it is likely a pandemic will originate outside of North America, and we may have advance warning of it s arrival y outbreaks will occur simultaneously across the country, preventing reallocation of human and other resources from one jurisdiction to another y a pandemic could last for several months, which sets it apart from other emergencies which may last for several hours or d ays y health care workers and other first responders w ill likely face a higher risk o f infection than the general population, reducing response capacity y widespread illness will increase the likelihood of personnel shortages in other key areas such as police, fire, utility and tra nsportation services The Provinc e and the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) has devel oped the B. C. Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan to ensure the province is prepared to deal with this kind of event. Each B.C. ministry, Crown Corporation, Health Au thority and l ocal governments is also responsible for planning for a pandemic, with the requirement that th eir plans be consis tent with Bri tish Columbia's. All provincial planning underway for pandemic influenza is con sistent with the plans of both the World Health Organization (WHO) and th e Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) Pandemic Plans and principles. Participants involved in pandemic planning for British Columbia include: * Ministry of Health Services * Provincial Health Officer * British Columbia Centr e for Disease * Provincial Emergency Program, Ministry of Public Safety an d Solicitor General * Provincial Health Services Authority * Medical H ealth Officers * Public Health Nursing * Paramedics /Emergency Physicians * Ministry of Employment and Income Assistance * BC Coroner Service * BC Pharmacists Associ ation Version 3 August 2005 179 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex K * Union of BC Municipalities * Occup ational Health a nd Safety Ag ency for Hea lthcare in B.C. * Funeral Association of B.C. * BC Professionals in Infe ction Control * Workers' Compensation Board * Public Health Agency o f Canada * Health Canada (Note: wh ere an animal-borne flu strain is in volved, Agriculture Canada, Ca nada Food Inspection and the BC Ministry of Agriculture and La nds will be informed and involved). Communications planning is a vital part of pandem ic planning. The Ministry of Health Public Affairs Bran ch (HPAB) i s working with Health Authorities and other organizations to as sist in the development of a coordinated respons e in the event of a pandemic. The B.C. government, Health Authority an d local government pand emic commu nication plan s must be co mpatible with the BC Emergency Management Structure (B CERMS). BCERMS provides a common organizational structure and control, and enhances co mmunicatio n between agencies respo nding to an emergency or disaster. BACKGROUND The WHO is a United Na tions specialized agency f or health, established in 1948. The organization is responsible for global surveillance of influenza vi rus. It has a network of 112 National Influenza Centres on all continents to monitor influenz a acti vity and isolate influenza viruses. Pandemics generally occu r every 40 years, with the la st in 1967. Experts at the WHO are predicting a global influenza pand emic could emerge in the near future. It is uncertain which influenza strain will emerge and how severe the impact will be. Avian flu virus h as spread throughout the bird population in Southeast Asia and now parts of Eur ope. Over the last year, about 60 people have died in Southeast Asia fr om avian flu; this could be the em ergence of a possible pandemi c virus. With so much uncertainty, all planning is based on hypothetical situations. The WHO has issued a global alert that governments should have pandemic preparedness plans in place. They have establis hed six phases to define the on-set of a pandemic and help guide nations in their planning: Interpandemic (before the on-set of a pandemic) Phase 1 - no influenza viruses have been detected i n humans Phase 2 - a circulating animal influenza virus poses a substantial risk of hum an disease Pandemic Alert (huma n infect ion with new vi rus) Phase 3 - human infectio n with a new virus but no human to h uman spread Phase 4 - small localized human to hu man transmi ssion Phase 5 - larger localized human to hu man transmi ssion Pandemic Peri od (on-set of a pandemic ) Phase 6 - increased and sustained transmission in the general population. Version 3 August 2005 180 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex K The WHO h as determined that we are currently between Phase 2 and 3. The identification of the beginning of a pandemic could come from eith er the WHO's global surveillan ce network, or from an individual country's health care system where heal th care pro fessionals are already on the alert. If human to hu man transmi ssion is first identified in an individual country, it wi ll be the resp onsibility of that country's health care system to info rm the WHO, which will in turn make the global determination and relay that information to countri es around the world. In Canada, PHAC will be responsible for making the national declaration, with each province's Provincial Health Officer taking the lead in their jurisdiction. In the event of a pandemic, communication respon sibility and information flow are outlined in the following way: The BC Ministry of Health, through the Office of the Provincial Health Of ficer (PHO), is the lead in th e province in the event of a pandemic/communica ble disease o utbreak. The PHO is the main provincial spokesperson and is responsible, with advice from BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) for the decision to declare a pandemic in the province. The Ministry of Health E mergency Management B ranch, in conjunction with the Provincial Emergency Program (PEP) under the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, is responsible for ensuring plans at the provincial, regional and local level are activated. B. C.'s well-tested emergency m anagement structure has established, functional links between ministry emergency opera tions and the provincial emergency m anagement structure. The Public Affairs Bure au (PAB), Ministry of Health, will have primary responsibility for communicati ons support for the PHO. It will work closely with emergency communicati on contacts at P AB headquar ters and PEP to prom ote coordination and understanding of roles between pub lic health agencies and the agenci es responsible for consequence managemen t. The British Columbia Crisis Communications Strategy for Major Provincial Emergencies outlines current provincial emergency and disa ster communicati ons principals and protocols. It recognizes the importa nce of coordinating public communications in affected areas, a nd for linking up all engaged partners under the British Columbia Emergency Response Management Structure. Medical Heal th Officers, in consultatio n with the P HO and Hea lth PAB, are the designated spokespeople in their provincial regio n of responsibility. The BCCDC will provide technical medical support to the PHO. Information will be shared on a consistent and immediate basis b etween these offices. PHAC will support provincial efforts and continue to lead anti- viral acquisition and vacci ne development. PHAC will also continu e to link with the WHO f or monitoring and surveillance. Experts predict that it will be between one to six months between the time an influenza pandemic is first identified globally and the time th e outbreak b egins in B.C. Within three months of the virus arriving in the province, it is expected most commun ities will be affected. It is anticipated that the pandemic wi ll occur in waves, striking different parts of the province at different times. T he estimated im pact of a pan demic on B.C. is: y more than three million people will be infected Version 3 August 2005 181 BC Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness Plan: A nnex K y as many as 1. 8 million will be clinically ill y up to 18, 500 will need hospital care, and y as many as 6, 800 people could die from related co mplications. (Source: BC Pandemic Preparedness Plan May 2005). A prolonged pandemic influenza even t will impact directly or indirectly a large part of the provincial population and will require ongoing c ross-go vernment suppor t at the provincial level. Throughout this event, the PHO along with the Executi ve Director of PEP will advise and make recommendations on response and strategic mana gement to the key provincial ministers.
