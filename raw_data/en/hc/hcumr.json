We knew this, and made it our #1 priority to facilitate energy, engagement, and material that we knew you would not only benefit from clinically, but would also INSPIRE you. This conference surpassed everyone's expectations on what a virtual conference could be. We received so much positive feedback that we have decided to offer the entire conference for those of you who may have missed it. THIS IS NOT SIMPLY THE DOWNLOADS (which will be available as well). THIS IS THE THE ENTIRETY OF THE HOSTED CONFERENCE, COMPLETE WITH AWARDS CEREMONIES AND EVEN OUR VENDOR NIGHT. During the conference it was discussed how this conference has really taken the place of the beloved NORTHWEST NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS CONVENTION (NWNPC), which has left a void in the profession of events championing both elder wisdom as well as quality clinical pearls. But don't take my word for it. Here are some of the things people sent to me following the event: \"Thank you to you and all of the organizing committee for a fabulous conference! I was only there yesterday but I was so happy I was ... I left feeling full and inspired and connected to our community and vis - and I've been to a lot of conferences in the past! You all have created a safe and inclusive space. Thank you.\" - PJ \"What a fantastic conference!!\" - PB \"You truly did an amazing job... Congratulations to you and your team... It was a privilege to be part of the event...\" - PR \"I really enjoyed being part of the Healing Skies faculty this year. What an engaged group of attendees!\" - LF If you are looking for a group of NDs who are doing things a little differently, who are connected with elder knowledge and wisdom, and who want to share information despite what the political arena might say about it, LOOK NO FURTHER. This is the conference you want to be a part of! I know you're going to love it. Share with your colleagues, and we are excited to get to know you.
