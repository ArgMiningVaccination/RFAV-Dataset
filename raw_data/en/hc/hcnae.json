I value sustainability in my work, whether with past treatment plans or in teaching others to live a more sustainable life, in tune with nature, where support between them and Mother Earth is mutually exclusive. I work well with those interested in having a deeper connection with their bodies, healing journey and whole being. For those stepping into a more empowered role in their own healthcare, wanting an ally in the world of medicine, and looking for something different will find support here. I will support and hold space for all of this. Together, we will bridge the gap between physical, mental, emotional & spiritual health. I honor the diversity and many walks of life that those I serve exemplify, and am continuously learning from them. Recognizing and seeing connections is in my nature. Often, we need that in healing and growth ~ an in-tune, medically trained, objective perspective combined with the nature-supported, compassionate, intuitive ways of knowing ~ calling upon both brain hemispheres as well as other organs of intelligence, including the heart. I can reflect back what one may deeply know, but may not have words for, yet be fully conscious of or be able to see the full picture of quite yet. Often, I simply need to hold the space, witness, and watch you discovery of what you know is true, for you. It is not uncommon, in visits of mine, to go from a simple education of lab results, exploring the microscopic landscape of one's body, to the next, where we find ourselves diving into soul work of realizing purpose in life or clearing unwanted energies, stories and patterns that may be holding you back. The stories are beautiful, and the journey, although difficult and frustrating at times (as journeys can be), can also hold much beauty and wisdom. What unfolds is healing and transformation. Often, it does not stop at self, but transcends to family, community and beyond.

I served in Peace Corps Morocco from 2007-2009, assigned to a community in the Middle Atlas Mountains, doing environmental education, health & wellness and youth & women's empowerment. Living there, no English was spoken. I quickly learned the nuanced ways of sensing, communicating, supporting, healing and holding space, for others and myself. During my education at Bastyr University, I bike commuted EVERYWHERE, in all seasons. I challenged myself to use my car as little as possible. It it was a combination of earth stewardship, that exhilarating PNW air and the feminine warrior within me that kept me going. I am a Virgo sun, Virgo rising and Pisces Moon I was born and raised in Globe, AZ, until I was 12 years old. I then moved to Northern Minnesota, where I continued to grow and come of age. I learned what it felt like to be an outsider, a participant observer (no wonder I majored in Anthropology), as well as how to adapt and find belonging. It didn't happen right away. I did not truly fall in love with the place until I learned to connect to the land, plants, animals and landscape. It also has broadened my definition of what \"home\" really is... I fought forest fires for six seasons, serving on Minnesota fire crews and the Prineville Hotshots. My favorite activities to do after my son goes to bed include yoga, dancing, writing, listening to podcasts or Audible, playing with plants and herbs, working on my chakras, spending time with my married partner, Blake, or \"kitchen witchery\" as I like to call it ~ whether baking sourdough cinnamon rolls, fermenting, or exploring new vegan recipes. And, sweeping. I love sweeping. A true Virgo Witch. When I was a little girl, I wanted to be a dancer when I grew up. I am allowing that little girl to come out and play and dance as often as she wants to these days. a few of my passions being in nature An epic hike, cold plunge, laying on the ground to gaze at the trees and listen to the bird songs. It is more about the being, not so much the doing. my family They are my people, my teachers, my support. Community We are meant to be connected. Our brains identify it as essential as water, food and air. The way my community supports, both near and far, is beyond words. I love you all. "}
