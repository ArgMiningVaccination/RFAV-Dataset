Acupuncture and herbal medicine helped to maintain and enhance natural radiance and maintain a youthful appearance. Today the popularity of cosmetic acupuncture and facial rejuvenation has grown as many celebrities, including Kim Kardashian, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, have turned to this natural and non-invasive technique. Facial rejuvenation acupuncture offers a healthier, more sustainable and longer term approach to anti-aging than techniques like botox, fillers and chemical peels that can ultimately cause damage to the body. Promote Healing Inside and Out Like any holistic medicine, cosmetic acupuncture not only addresses the blemishes on the skin, but also takes a deeper look into the overall health of the body. Many times what causes the physical appearance to age is rooted in deeper causes including stress, toxins from food and environment, dehydration and lack of sleep. In Chinese medicine, there are multiple acupuncture channels that run along the face, they include the stomach, intestines, bladder and gallbladder. Cosmetic acupuncture is designed to create harmony and balance within the whole body in order to promote healing inside and out. Some ways that this is achieved is by increasing blood flow and circulation to skin, nerves and muscles, heal tissue damage from acne and scarring, stimulate collagen production, tighten and lift skin. Internally acupuncture can also promote healthy looking skin by improving digestion, helping to eliminate edema and puffiness, decrease stress and depression, improve sleep quality and increase blood, lymph and oxygen circulation in the whole body. Regenerative Bio-Injections: All natural bio-injections are a great alternative to botox and fillers, which can be harmful and toxic to the body. When administered by an acupuncturist, these injections enhance the effectiveness of acupuncture by stimulating acupuncture points for a longer period of time. They also bring nutrients into the area of the face that most need them, providing a regenerative healing process. Substances used include homeopathic injectables like placenta comp and collagen. These are mild and safe for the body, with no known negative side effects. Because acupuncture and bio-injections are regenerative, they can actually reverse the effects of botox. Botox paralyzes the muscles in the face in order to slow down aging, acupuncture increases collagen production and circulation, which can reverse the actions of Botox. Natural treatments generally work slower but last longer and are more in balance with the overall health of the body long term. Forming Healthy Habits and A Daily Routine At home practices can increase the effectiveness of cosmetic acupuncture and contribute to healthy younger looking face, less wrinkles and less blemishes. It is very important to keep blood, lymph and oxygen flowing through the body and face. Staying well hydrated and practicing Qi Gong breathing techniques can promote this circulation, as well as gently self massage to promote lymphatic flow. When addressing acne, which many of us are noticing more of with the use of face coverings and masks, it is important to keep the skin clean. Topically this means washing your face with warm water, only touching your skin with clean hands and using organic cleansers and lotions. It is also important to wash reusable face masks after each use. Internally, we must also eat clean foods that are free of toxins. Greasy, sugary and overly processed foods contain toxins that can be released through the pores of our skin. Drinking plenty of clean water is also an important factor in skin care. Acupuncture stimulates the body's healing system, circulation, collagen production and long term healing. Results are usually best seen after 6-10 treatments but can last much longer than other conventional treatments. With regular maintenance every few weeks or seasonally depending on the person and at home care, the results can last years. Treatments are usually done no more than one week apart so that the body has time for regeneration between sessions. Each person is addressed individually based on their specific needs.
