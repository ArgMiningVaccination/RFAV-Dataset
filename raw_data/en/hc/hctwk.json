The agency previously identified four cases of melioidosis\u2014two of them fatal\u2014linked with Better Homes & Gardens Lavender & Chamomile Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones, which was made in India and sold by Walmart. Melioidosis is caused by the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei. The agency said in a [statement](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00456.asp?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_511-DM69519&ACSTrackingLabel=HAN%20454%20-%20General%20Public&deliveryName=USCDC_511-DM69519) Wednesday that it is now testing for the presence of the bacteria in five other scents under the same brand name with Gemstones: Lemon & Mandarin, Lavender, Peppermint, Lime & Eucalyptus, and Sandalwood & Vanilla, CNN reported. Those five scents have been added to the recall, and consumers who have the products should not use them. Instead of throwing the products out, consumers should pack them carefully and send them in for refunds, the CDC and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission advised. The products were sold online nationwide through Walmart and at a limited number of Walmart stores between February and Oct. 21, 2021. When disposing of the products, \"Double bag the bottle in clean, clear zip-top bags and place in a cardboard box. Return the bagged and boxed product to a Walmart store,\" the CDC said in a statement issued last month. \"Wash sheets or linens that the product may have been sprayed on using normal laundry detergent and dry completely in a hot dryer; bleach can be used if desired.n Wipe down counters and surfaces that might have the [spray](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/spray/) on them with undiluted PineSol or similar disinfectant.nLimit direct handling of the spray bottle and wash hands thoroughly after touching the bottle or linens. If gloves were used, wash hands afterward.\" The CDC has also issued a health alert for doctors and other [health care providers](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+care+providers/) to watch for patients with symptoms of melioidosis\u2014acute or chronic localized infection that may include [high fever](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high+fever/), pain, headache and abscesses in the liver, lung, spleen and prostate\u2014and to ask patients if they've used certain aromatherapy sprays, CNN reported.
