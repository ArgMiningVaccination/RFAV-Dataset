Several points are made in oppositionto many health professionals' opinions that most nutritionalsupplements are unnecessary. Considerations discussed include: (1)faulty definitions of health; (2) validity of nutrition research; of dogmatism among health professionals; (4) government policiesand pronouncements; (5) propaganda and quackery; and (6) the notionof a well-balanced diet. It is concluded that, although the medicalprofession and most scientists strongly question the value ofnutritional supplements, there is good reason to suspect thatsupplements might help most people.

There is considerable disagreementamong professionals in the field of nutrition over a widerange of issues (as there is in all professions), but onefundamental issue seems to rise above the others. Itis thequestion of whether or not one should take nutritionalsupplements; i.e., vitamin pills (which might also containminerals).It is reasonably obvious from what we hear and read thata substantial majority of nutritionists, dieticians,physicians, as well as government agencies and professionalbodies, believes that the taking of nutritional supplementsis useless, at least for apparently healthy people, and thateverything we need can be gotten from the food we eat, aslong as we eat well-balantred diets. There appears to be goodreason. ior such a claim, but it is based on severalassumptions that are assailed by those on the other side ofthe issue.There are biochemists and physicians whovigorously support the taking of vitamin pills. Their con-elusions are based upon what they must believe is sound re-search and clinical evidence, just as the other side's con-clusions are based upon what they believe is sound research.:_s one side's research better than the other side's research?I don't know.I'm not a nutritionist and am not qualified tojudge.It may be that those in the field, themselves, have 3 2difficulty in distinguishing between valid and invalidresearch.Whatever the case, there is increasingly convincingevidence that vitamin supplementation is beneficial towardmaximizing the length amid health of our lives. There is,however, no absolute proof that this is so. More researchneeds to be done to reconcile conflicting results, but thereis an increasing number of biochemists and physicians whichhas turned to nutritional therapy for patients and maladiesthat do not respond to conventional doctoring. They havealso come to believe that the taking of vitamin pills wouldgo a long way toward the prevention of many maladies in thefirst place. Itake vitamin pills, along with the other eightymillion people in this country who do so on a daily basis.That's onethird of the population. Are we naive, haplessdolts, suckered by the false claims of the health foodindustry?I think not.Anyone who says that there is NOevidence to support the taking of vitamin pills is eithermisinformed or grossly bending the truth. There is plenty ofresearch, clinical observation, and reasoned opinion whichindicates that nutritional supplementation can be useful tothe vast majority of the population.My ultimate intent with this presentation is not toprove to you that you should be taking vitamin pills, becausesuch proof does not exist. Instead,I want to present to you 4 3a summary of the evidence and reasoning that some scientistsand physicians are promoting as a strong indication thatsupplements should be taken, even in the absence of absoluteproof.Hopefully,I can stimulate you to read what I'veread, and you can come to your own informed conclusion afterviewing both sides of the story.The books listed in the bibliography were written bybiochemists and physicians. As far as Ican tell, theauthors are not quacks, qnd they have no financial. stake inthe sale of nutritional supplements. They are just trying topresent what they believe to be the truth. SOME INTRODUCTORY THOUGHTSBefore getting into the nutritional supplementcontroversy itself, it might be worthwhile to introduceseveral terms and thoughts. THE NUTRIENTS AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICSIn order to survive, man has several environmentalrequirements.He needs appropriate air pressure,temperature, oxygen content of air, and the availability offood and water. Food contains nutrients, and they can beclassified as being either macro or micro. Macro nutrientsare fat, protein, and carbohydrate, as well as water. Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals.There are more than forty known nutrients that the bodyneeds to one degree or another, and it is likely that there 5 4are others in food which have yet to 1:1.identified.Experiments have been done which indicate this. When animalsare raised on purely synthetic diets, containing all theknown nutrients, they appear to live and grow in a mannersimilar to those animals raised on natural food. However,the \"synthetic\" group does not reproduce as well. it istheorized that there is something in the natural food thathas yet to be isolated. One of the last nutrient discoverieswas made by Dr. Roger Williams, biochemist at theUniversity of Texas, and the author of several books onnutrition.He discovered pantothenic acid (vitamin B-5).For the most part, nutrients do not act independently.They work as a team. So, the presence or absence of onenutrient can affect the performance capabilities of others.One could be diagnosed as having a vitamin A deficiency,when,in fact, the real deficiency is zinc. Zinc is requiredfor the release of vitamin A stored in the liver.Furthermore, the complete absence of a nutrient eventuallyresults it death. If vitamin C is missing from our diets, wedie within a few months. But, we could live years withoutvitamin B-12 and still longer without vitamin E. In some cases,',he body can even make up for a dietary deficiency ofa nutrient by manufacturing its own supply.Several of the Bvitamins can be produced in the intestines; and, when dietaryniacin (vitamin B-3) is low and sufficient tryptophan (anamino acid) is present, the body can convert the tryptophaninto niacin.Vitamin A is found in animal products, but a 6 5substantial percentage of the body's supply of vitamin Acomes from plants, even though there is no vitamin A inplants.What is in plants is carotene, which the bodyconverts into vitamin A.Nutrients function in the body in three basic ways:(1) involvement in the regulation of metabolic processes,(2) tissue growth, maintenance and repair, and (3) provisionof energy (carbohydrate and prote'n yield four calories pergram, and fat yields nine calories per gram).Sugars and starches are classified as carbohydrate, withstarch being a more complex molecule than sugar.Carbohydrate is broken down by the body into the blood sugarglucose.Excess carbohydrate intake is stored as glycogen inthe muscles ind liver and is called upon during exercise.Any further excess is stored as body fat.Fat is usually identified as being either saturated orunsaturated.Saturated fat is solid at room temperature, a-dunsaturated is liquid in the form of oil. However, there isno such thing as a fat that is purely saturated orunsaturated.All fat is made up of some combination ofsaturated and unsaturated fatty acids. When the unsaturatedfatty acids predominate, the fat is visible as liquid. Themolecular structures are illustrated on the next page. Notethat a fatty acid is a chain of carbon atoms with hydrogenatoms attached. When all the hydrogen spaces are filled, thefatty acid is saturated. When spaces are open, the fattyacid is unsaturated. 7 SATURATED FATTY ACID UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDH H H H HifIIH-C-C-C-C-RHHHH-C-C-C-C-H HH6 Protein is the most plentiful substance in the body,except for water (water is 55% of the body). It consists oftwenty- -two amino acids, eight of which must be gotten fromfood (others are made in the body). The body's muscles,skin, hair, organs and other structures consist mainly ofprotein.For protein synthesis to take place in the body,all twenty-two amino acids must be present in the correctproportions.Only one pattern is usable by the body. Thesmall presence of just one amino acid lowers proteinsynthesis by the amount of deviation from that required. Oneis only as strong as the weakest link. If one amino acid is-,,-.,mpletely missing, no protein can be made.One myth about protein that needs to 1:-.,dispelled is theidea that one needs to eat meat to get high quality protein.That's not true at all. Protein is protein as long as alltwenty --two amino acids are present in the right proportions.One gram of fully utilizable egg protein equals one gram offully utilizable meat protein. Where differences come in iswhen you consider how much protein weight is actuallyutilizable.For example, 94% of the protein found in the eggis utilizable by the body for protein synthesis, whereas only67% of meat protein is fully utilizable. However, the actutl s$ 7quantity of protein in meat is greater than that of the egg. So,the egg is higher in protein quality out lower in proteinquantity.As far as the vitamins and minerals go, one could spendmuch time detailing the functions and food sources of eachnutrient.The functions of some vitamins and minerals willbe discussed as we talk about degenerative disease. To knowthe food sources of each nutrient is relatively unimportant,because so many nutrients are found in so many foods in somany different combinations that it becomes something of awaste.. of time to keep track of it. For example, carrots areusually identified as the source for vitamin A (carotene,actaally).But carotene can be found in all sorts of foods,and carrots are good sources for many other nutrients. filepoint is that as long as you eat good fcod in reasonablevariety, you will get a good combination of all thenutrients. WHY SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED WITH NUTRITION, ANYWAY?We've all heard the saying \"You are what you eat\"and itis literally true. There is nothing in our bodieswhich is not built from the nutrients in food. Many animaland human studies have been done which show that how well onegrows, looks, feels, functions, and the length of one's lifedepend on the nutritional status of the body's cells.Healthy cells equal a healthy body. Many, if not all, ofman's infectious and degenerative diseases are thought to be9 linked to nutritional deficiencies. Degenerative diseaserefers to conditions, such as heart disease and cancer, whichdevelop over the years, whereas infections tome and gorelatively quickly.Aside from commonly recognized degenerative diseases,nutrition affects aspects of our lives which we may notconsider as being disease. Behavior and mental disordershave nutritional connections. It has been found inexperiments that poorly nourished animals become unkemptthey stop grooming themselves. They also don't get alongwith each other, with fighting and killing being commonplace.When nourished, the opposite is true. Hyperactivity in somechildren can be turned on and off like a faucet with thefeeding or withholding of sugar and chemical additives.Mental conditions, such as insanity, depression, anxiety,schizophrenia, and forgetfulness have nutritional bases; andall have been known to respond to nutritional therapy. Thereis even evidence to support the relationship between poornutrition and criminal behavior. THE MISTAKES OF HISTORYOver the course of history there have been several foodhandling mistakes which dramatically illustrate the effectsof nutrition on health.The staple food of the Orient for many centuries hasbeen rice.Whole rice sto.ed in hot and humid climatesbecomes weevil infested, thus inedible. To solve that10 9problem, a method of refining the rice into what is now knownas white rice was established. Weevils won't eat whit\" ricebecause it won't support life. Therefore, white rice can bestored.The reason white rice doesn't support life issimple.Much of tile nutrition )f the original grain isremoved.The largest deficiency involves thiamine (vitaminB-1).About 75% of thiamine is lost in the refining process.Since rice was consumed as a staple food, many peoplecontracted beriberi (vitamin B-1 deficiency), and many ofthose people died.In the early 1900's corn became a staple food in thesouthern United States. Poor people couldn't afford to eatanything else. Corn, however,is substantially deficient inniacin (vitamin B-3), and pellagra results from itsdeficiency.Many southerners contracted [.ellagra, with oneof its symptoms being a redness of the skin. Since poorwhite people worked in the fields, the backs of their neckswQuld get even redder from exposure to the sun. It was fromthis combination of events that the term \"redneck\" evolved.Throughout history there has been a need to preservefood for storage and transportation. The drying of food wasused for many years; but when dried in the presence of air,vitamin C is completely lost from the food. People, such assailors, who relied on dried foods for long periods, commonlycontracted scurvy, which is characterized by skin and gumproblems and eventual death. In the 1700's a British 11 10physician discovered that the feeding of citrus fruits toBritish sailors prevented scurvy from occurring. One of thefruits eaten was the lime, and the British, since then, haveoften seen referred to as \"limeys.\"Some researchers think we are currently involved in afar-reaching series of food handling mistakes. The majorportion of the civilized world has given up its age-oldresponsibility for growing and gathering its own food. Thatjob has been turned over to what has become known as the foodindustry.The original concern of the food industry was toget food to the consumer before it spoiled. But, that hassince degenerated into a concern for provid;.nq food that canbe quickly prepared and is fun to eat food that looks go(-1,smells good, and tastes good. So,the food industry hasgiven us processed food which has nutrients taken out of it,artificial ingredients put into it, and in some cases,molecular structures rearranged. Sugar is extracted fromsugar cane and beets and is injected into virtuallyeverything that is packaged for sale. Even fresh fruits andvegetables might contain colorings, pesticides, andherbicides.And, frozen and canned vegetables Jiiii fruitshave been processed in such a way that their shelf lives areimproved, but their nutritional contents are lessenedrelative to their original statuses. 12 11The results of all the nutritionally deficient food weeat are not as clear cut as those from the other foodhandling mistakes mentioned previously. Since no one food isconsumed as a steple, no one nutrient is grossly deficient inour diets.Therefore, no one specific, identifiable diseaseresults from our way of eating. But, just as beriberiresults from a thiamine deficiency, heart disease, cancer,diabetes, and arthritis are diseases which seem to havegeneralized nutritional connections. As we shall see later,degenerative disease is not some inevitable happenstance. Itis the direct result of the way we eat and live. THE MAJOR ISSUEAs previously stated, the one fundamental issue innutrition today involves the worth of nutritionalsupplements.Why do most professionals say that supplementsare not necessary, that they are probably outright uselessfor what we might call normal healthy people, and that theymight even be harmful? Obviously, the preponderance of theresearch and reasoned opinion must indicate that one can livea normal, healthy life by eating a well-balanced diet. Thatconclusion is very likely based on several faultyassumptions, however, and is influenced by factors that :endto skew people's judgments .,r)that direction. In support, ofthat charge, there are six major points to be made, and theywill be discussed in some detail. 13 12POINT NUMBER ONE: OUR DEFINITION OF HEALTH IS PROBABLY FAULTYPerhaps the biggest source of misinformation involvedwith the vitamin pill issue is a definition of what healthreally is.It is not simply the absence of obvious disease.There are many levels of functionability between death andoptimal health. You can have a vitamin C deficiency withoutcontracting scurvy. Yet, the medical profession tends torecognize only the connection between scurvy and vitamin C,not the myriad of other, more subtle problems that can occurfrom vitamin C deficiency. Experiments have shown thatanimals need 20-100 times more nutrients for good health thanthe simple prevention of obvious disease. It is important torealize that diseases such as cancer and heart disease do notoccur magically overnight. It's not as though one is happilywalking along, and he suddenly falls off a cliff.Degenerative disease takes years and years to develop; andalong the way, a person can easily be lulled into thinkingthat he is in good health, when in fact, he is not. He isjust taking a longer, slower path to the bottom of the cliff.In our country the average age at death is aboutseventy-three years (which ranks only eighteenth among allnations).Yet,it has been determined that one's geneticlife span is about 110-120 years. That's a difference offorty-five years. Furthermore, people usually startdeteriorating at around the age of forty, which means thatthirty-three years of the average seventy-three are spent in 14 13something other than optimal health. THIS IS A CRUCIALPOINT!Much depends on a person's own standards of ho;; longand how well he/she wants or expects to live. Thosestandards are almost always too low. Right now, at leasttwenty-five million Americans suffer from some sort ofchronic and disabling disease. We can do better.Aging seems to occur in two basic pathways. One is theresult of aging clocks. In essence, aging clocks shut downvarious systems in the body as a pre-determined geneticevent.If the damaging effects of lifestyle could beperfectly repaired over and over, people could lead healthy,active lives to the end of their genetically determinedlifespans.There would be minimal mental and physicaldeterioration toward death. People would tend to simply diesuddenly in their sleep, as an aging clock shut off a crucialsystem of the body. There are groups of people living in theworld today who demonstrate this phenomenon. The Hunzas, wholive in the mountains of northern India, and the people wholive in the Georgia region of Russia, are two such groups.They essentially live off the land and are touched by moderncivilization only minimally. Their societies are not riddledwith degenerative disease.Heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, senility,and so forth, are all degenerative diseases which occur dueto random damage events. Throughout life, the body's cells,tissues, and molecules are constantly experiencing damage.r15 14The body has an immune system which attempts to protect thebody from damaging agents and attempts to repair any damagethat might have occurred. Random aging occurs when therepair mechanism cannot keep up with the rate of damage.Unfortunately, damage promotes more damage, and the body'simmune system gradually declines in functionability as aresult.So you end up with a snowball effect, where bothelements of the damage/repair ratio are going in the wrongdirections.Damage is on the increase while the body'sability to repair the damage is on the decrease. The actualrate of aging, then, increases as one gets older.Let's take a brief look at some of the random damagemechanisms in the body. What do hardening of the arteries,muscular inflexibility, and wrinkling of the skin have incommon?They are all the result of the same aging process,called cross-linking. Collagen is a protein in the bodywhich serves as an intercellular glue. It holds the bodytogether.When collagen is attacked by certain agents, andthe immune system can't totally control the damage,undesirable chemical bonds occur between molecules, causingan inflexibility in the tissues at hand. It is well knownthat overexposure to sunlight (ultraviolet light) can causenot only skin cancer, but a premature wrinkling of the skin.Wrinkled skin has been cross-linked. A different chemicalagent may cross-link the arteries, making them inflexible and 16 15hard.When blood gets pumped through the vascular system,arteries need the flexibility to expand as the major thrustsof the blood flow periodically pass through. Hardened,brittle arteries don't have that flexibility, and they aresusceptible to simply blowing out into, for example, acerebral hemorrhage. As we've all experienced, our bodiesbecome stiffer and less agile as we grow older. We cannot dothe things that we once could, because cross-linkedconnective issue (tendons and muscle fascia) won't let us.Researchers have found that the cross-linking process can belargely prevented or slowed by supplying the body with theright nutrients in the right amounts.Senility isa condition we associate with old age andconsider to be virtually inevitable. It isn't.Neurotransmitters are chemicals in the brain which are madeby the brain cells (neurons). Neurons communicate with eachother through the passage of neurotransmitters from cell tocell.Everything we do learning, moving body parts,emotional feelings depends upon that process. Brainfunctions deteriorate when the brain's ability to make anduse neurotransmitters decreases. Neurotransmitters are madefrom nutrients. Acetylcholine is made from the B vitamincholine, norepinephine comes from the amino acidsphenylalanine and tyrosine, and dopamine is made from theamino acid L-dopa. There are many other neurotransmittersand nutrients that are used to make them. Experiments show 17 16that memory loss, apathy, and confusion, symptoms associatedwith senility, can be prevented and partially reversed byappropriate nutrition. Furthermore, the functions of thebrain can be improved in supposedly healthy people. Forexample,in a study of MIT students who were given threegrams of choline a day, it was found that their memoriesimproved relative to a control group which did not get thecholine.Many people who are thought to be healthy, at least froma nutritional standpoint, are actually living in twilightzones.They are tired, nervous, constipated, psychologicallyinsecure, have indigestion, headaches, and sleep disorders.Those are symptoms that usually can't be connected to anyspecific origin, but people (and many physicians) thinkthat's a normal part of life. What they don't realize isthat those symptoms are an indication that the body's cellsare not being nourished sufficiently. Those symptoms areprobably the forerunners of degenerative disease, which mayreveal itself in no uncertain terms tomorrow or ten yearsfrom tomorrow.For years and years most physicians have supported thewell-balanced diet approach to health and are skeptical aboutthe concept of seeking specific nutritional solutions topeople's problems. There is a good reason for that. Doctorstypically don't know much about nutrition. They don't haveto take a nutrition class in medical school. They are taught 18 17crisis medicine how to diagnose the overt symptoms of acondition and to prescribe drugs or perform surgery to remedythe situation. Aspirin is commonly prescribed for headaches.But the body's lack of aspirin isn't what's causing theheadaches.The aspirin is just a quick fix for an underlyingproblem which often is not pursued.One of the reasons that the medical establishment mightshy away from nutritional therapy involves the complex andconfusing ways that deficiency conditions manifestthemselves.They develop in different ways in differentpeople.Due to biochemical individuality and differences ingenetic susceptibility, the same nutritional deficienci maylead to eyesight problems in one person, headaches inanother, and insomnia in yet another. Such confoundingsymptoms were clearly described by an eighteenth centuryphysician as they relate to scurvy.This disease, so frequently attending all long voyages,and so particularly destructive to us, is surely themost singular and unaccountable of any that affects thehuman body.Its symptoms are inconstant andinnumerable, and its progress and effects extremelyirregular.Scarcely any two persons have the samecomplaints, and where there has been found someconformity in the symptoms, the order of theirappearance has been totally different. However, itfrequently puts on the form of many other diseases, andit is therefore not to be described by any exclusive andinfallible criterions.Obviously,it is difficult to determine what causes what,when it comes to nutrition and disease. Furthermore, thereis no reliable laboratory method for determining a person'sexact nutritional status. So,it is far easier to ignore the 19 18relationship between nutrition and disease than to deal with it.And, that is what the medical profession has been doingfor years.As nutritionist, Jean Mayer, says, \"Our studiesat Harvard suggest that the average physician knows a lit'lemore about nutrition than the average secretary unlessthe secretary has a weight problem. Then she probably knowsmore than the average physician.\"Current medical thinking can be traced back to thesecond half of the nineteene- century. It was then that the\"germ theory of disease\" was largely developed by LouisPasteur.He discovered that bacteria caused many of theinfectious diseases that had plagued man for centuries. Withthe discovery of cures for one disease after another, themedical and research communities slipped into a thoughtprocess that pursued infection as being the source ofvirtually all human disease. However, certain conditions,such as scurvy, beriberi, pellagra, and rickets escapedcategorization as disorders caused by infection. It wasn'tuntil the early 1900's that some researchers theorized thatthose maladies must have some sort of nutritional connection.There must be something in food other than fat, protein, andcarbohydrate something so minute that it escaped previousdetection.The name given to the unknown substance was\"vitamines\", and it was theorized that its absence in thebody could cause disease.The scientific community eventually jumped on the ideaand expended much research energy toward isolating individual20 19vitamins and relating them to specific needs in humanmetabolism.It was found that scurvy resulted from adeficiency of vitamin C, beriberi from a deficiency of B-1,pellagra from deficiency of B-3, and rickets from a vitamin Ddeficiency.The minimum vitamin concentrations necessary toprevent those diseases were also established. With thisevidence in hand, researchers sought to go even further,attempting to cure such diseases as polio with supplementalvitamins, just as they had previously cured infections withantibiotics.After years of experimentation, though, theyfound that they couldn't; and by 1950, much of the scientificcommunity had given up on the idea of using vitamins as\"drugs\" to cure specific diseases, other than those whichcould be identified as deficiency disorders. Th-y concludedthat nutritional intake beyond tnat which is necessary toprevent the recognized deficiency diseases had no effect onany other disease, and such intake was unnecessary.Scientific energies turned back to drugs as the fundamentalavenue toward curing disease, and the notion that vitaminsupplements are useful medical instruments has been largelyburied ever since.Although deaths from heart attacks have decreased inthis country in recent years, the incidence of heart diseasecontinues to rise. Deaths have decreased because heartdisease is detected earlier, and better surgical proceduresand other forms of rehabilitation are being employed. What 21 20we nerd is prevention of the problem in the first plac.-1-.; and,as we shall see later, the medical profession's preventionplan for heart disease in incomplete. A researcher atHarvard recently (19C5) concluded that we are losing thefight against cancer; that what we should be doing isconcentrating on its prevention rather than its cure. It isimportant that physicians generally adopt that way ofthinking, butI wonder if they will eventually conclude thatsuperior nutrition is a large part of the answer. Iam not condemning the medical profession. They dogood work within the limitations of their focus. What theyneed to do is expand their focus to include nutrition as abasis for the prevention and cure of infectious anddegenerative disease. It was once said by the Englishclinician, Parry of Bath, that it is often \"more important toknow what kind of person has a (;isease than what kind ofdisease a person has.\" Throughout one's lifetime, a person'sbody is constantly being attacked by bacteria, viruses, freeradicals, cancer cells, and a vaiety of damaging chemicals.If three people are exposed to the same germ, one might beunaffected, one might get a cold, and the other might getpneumonia.The differences lie in cellular nutrition.The question that physicians should ask is this: are aperson's cells nutritionally sound enough to allow the bodyto defend itself with its own immune system'? The questionyou should ask is, am I satisfied with the idea that I am 22 21statistically scheduled to die at the age of seventy-threewhile gradually deteriorating toward that death? Given thecircumstances in which I live and the lifestyle to which I'vebecome accustomed, is there anything I can do to extend mylifespan and improve my quality of health? Although onecould reasonably argue that a change in lifestyle cancontribute to improved health, one could also argue that thetaking of nutritional supplements, with or without a changein lifestyle, can at least partially offset the agingprocesses that lead to degeneratixe disease and prematuredeath. POINT NUMBER TWO: THE VALIDITY OF SOME NUTRITION RESEARCHIS SUBJECT TO QUESTIONMistakes in nutrition research are probably made allthe time.Research studies commonly use too little of anutrient for too short a time with the expectation of gettingdrug-like effects. Vitamins are not drugs. Although thereare instances where the appropriate supply of a singularnutrient can achieve rather quick, dramatic results,nutrients typically don't work that way. They work incombination with each other over long periods of time--months, years, and decadeF. Any improvements in healthusually occur so subtly that they are almost imperceptible ona day to day basis. Since the metabolic efficiency of a cellis dependent upon the nutrient that is in least supply, i.e.,a cell is only as strong as its weakest link, it is 23 22improbable that the taking of high con,:entrations of a singlenutrient will confer comprehensive health benefits. Heartdisease, cancer, and arthritis are not caused by singularnutrient deficiencies. Rather, they are the result of a moregeneralized deficiency, with many, if not all, the nutrientsbeing in less than optimal supply.The question of whether or not vitamin C treatment canhave any effect on cancer might illustrate the point. In themid-1970's, Drs. Linus Pauling and Ewan Cameron conducted astudy on terminal cancer patients in a Scottish hospital.One hundred patients received ten grams of vitamin C a day,and a control group of one thousand patients got a placebo.The control group s,,rvived only fifty days on the average,whereas, the ex2erimental group averaged more than twohundred days, nearly four times as long. Thirteen of the onehundred are still alive today (as of 1982). None of thecontrol group is. The vitamin C saved 13% of the people whowould otherwise have died, and it prolonged the life of theothers.A group of researchers followed up on that study bydoing its own. They found that vitamin C had no effect oncancer patients. However, Pauling discovered a flaw in thestudy.The researchers used patients who had undergone priorchemotherapy treatment. As a side effect, chemotherapy actsas a suppressing or destructive force on the body's naturalimmune system. Since vitamin C's major effect is to 24 23stimulate the body's immune system, its activity againstcancer becomes severely limited. In response to thecriticism, the -csearchers corrected the error and conductedanother study, designed to replicate the Pauling-Cameronstudy.Again, the results showed no effects. But Paulingagain had criticism. According to Pauling, the researchersdid not administer the treatment over the same period oftime.They stopped the vitamin C much earlier than didPauling and Cameron. Did the researchers make yet anothermistake, or is there more to the treatment of cancer thanjust a single nutrient, or is the damage from cancerfrequently irreversible with respect to nutritional therapy?All three could be true.The food industry has a pervasive influence on what thepublic believes about nutrition and the food we eat. Theindustry seems to outright purchase information and testimonywhich is beneficial to the products it sells. Companies suchas General Foods, Coca Cola, and Oscar Mayer spend a lot ofmoney on research grants, professorial chairs, consultant-ships, political contributions, lobbies in Congress,advertising, and published propaganda. They want us to buytheir products with the faith that consumption of thoseproducts is good for us, or at least not harmful. They arenot particularly interested in our health, unless healthfulproducts sell. They will do anything they have to do tomaintain a good public image. They are in business to make 25 24money.And, so is the one-billion-dollar-a-year health foodindustry.Nutritional supplement manufacturers probably dothe same things to promote their products.A significant portion of the nutrition research done inthe United States is conducted or sponsored by the foodindustry.A professor at a university might design a studyon some aspect of breakfast cereals, for Instance. Hesubmits it to General Mills for a research grant, and GeneralMills forks over several thousand dollars to do the study.This process is important to the professor, because his jobsubstantially depends on his ability to attract researchfunds to the university. Isit likely that a professor,whose research funds are provided by General Mills, willdetermine and announce that commercially processed cerealsare nutritionally unsound? Not if he ever again expects toreceive funding from that, or similar, companies!A specific example will illustrate the point. A well-known researcher and author and member of the faculty ofHarvard's nutrition department has regularly defended theintake of sugar as being essentially harmless. He says thatmost people could healthfully double their daily sugarintake.The average yearly per capita sugar consumption inthe United States is, by the way, one hundred twenty fivepounds.Over the course of his career he has given favorabletestimony to Congressional and Food and Drug Administrationboards of inquiry in behalf of the Sugar Association, The 26 25Cereal Institute, Kellogg, and Nabisco. He has sat on theboards of directors of several companies whose products hewas charged with evaluating. In one way or another thoseassociations and companies compensate him for rendering hisjudgments.What are the chances that those judgments areunbiased and based on independent research results?In another example related to sugar, two researchers atHarvard puolished a paper in 1974 showing that presweetenedcereals don't contribute to tooth decay. Kellogg Companysponsored the study, and it was designed in such a way thatthe connection between tooth decay and sugared cereals couldnever be established.One big reason that a person could say that sugarconsumption is basically harmless (except for persons whohave diabetes or hypoglycemia), is that nothing obvioushappens after you have eaten a candy bar. And even in thelong term view, excess sugar consumption cannot be directlyconnected to any one specific degenerative disease. However,it can very well have an effect on the body, both short termand long term.The short term effects of sugar can be as follows: 1.Bacteria in the body feed off sugar. There are heavyconcentrations of bacteria in one's mouth, throat, andintestinal tract. Tooth decay can occur when thebacteria in the mouth release an acid which eats awayat the tooth's enamel. :'respiratory infections occur when 27 26sugar-consuming bacteria grow in strength and overwhelmone's immune system. The same process can occur in theintestinal tract. 2.High sugar intake can cause overweight, especially in theabsence of enough calorie-burning exercise to offset thecalorie intake. Aside from that, several research stud-ies have shown that carbohydrate turns into body fat morereadily than pritein or fat food. Furthermore, animalson sugary diets put on more fat weight than animals onstarchy diets, given an equal number of calories.There are several problems with being overweight. a.In our society, an overweight person is lessattractive than one who is not. b.Excess fat puts an extra burden on the muscles andbones, because that weight must be structurallysupported and hauled around in movement. Related tothat,a fat person is less quick and agile than he/she would otherwise be. c.Since fat cells must be nutritionally supported likeother cells, an extra burden is placed on the heartto circulate blood over a larger area. d.Fat people have higher rates of cancer, heartdisease, and infectious disease. Fat stored in thebody is susceptible to oxidation, in the absence ofsufficient nutrients to prevent the process.Oxidation occurs when fats are attacked by certain 28 27chemicals, creating peroxidized fats (also calledfree radicals). The peroxidized fats do two harmfulthings to the body.(1) They act as an immune system depressant, inhibit-ing the effectiveness of the white blood cellsthat neutralize bacteria, viruses, cancer cells,and other harmful substances.(2) They cause damage directly by attacking cellularDNA which damages the function of the cell, out-right killing it or causing cancer. Furthermore,they inhibit the production of PGI-2, a hormonethat prevents abnormal blood clots in thearteries.Blood clots ultimately cause heartattacks and strokes. So, the overweight personis more susceptible to infection and degenerativedisease than a thinner person.The long term effects of sugar can be as follows: 1.The measure of a good food versus a bad food is thenutrient/calorie ratio. The more calories a foodcontains, the more nutrients are required to metabolizethem.The more nutrients a food contains per calorie,the more nutrients are left over to supply the body'scells.Since sugar is devoid of nutrients, it offers.)thing to the body and leaches nutrients (especiallyvitamins B and C) from the body's cells in order tometabolize it. Over a period of time the process becomes 29 28a contributor to aging and degenerative disease, as thebody's cells break down in function from a lack ofnutrients. 2.When a high-sugar food is eaten, and assimilat d into thebloodstream, it creates a high-blood-sugar situationwhich the body tries to bring back to normal. If aperson persistently abuses the body's regulatorymechanism, there's a good chance it will break down overtime.Hypoglycemia results (also called low bloodsugar).What typically happens is that, after sugar iseaten, the malfunctioning system secretes too muchinsalin into the bloodstream to pru,,ess the sugar intothe cells.The blood sugar level falls below normal,giving the victim a feeling of fatigue and listlessness.The victim typically eats another nigh-sugar food, whichelevates the blood sugar for a couple of hours and allowsthe victim to feel good again. However, low blood sugarresults soon after. The victim is caught in a viciouscycle.The only way to stop it is to severely reduceone's carbohydrate intake over a period of months, eatgood food, take nutritional supplement:,, and allow thebody to heal itself.One problem with sugar is that most people don't have a clueas to how much they take in every day. Beyond outrightdesserts, sugar is found almost everywhere in the processedfood supply.Back in the 1940's cereal sales were 'agging, 30 29so companies started to sugar-up their cereals to make themtaste better and sell better. Sugar is now found in breads,peanut butter, salad dressings, spaghetti sauce, and soforth.In order to avoid hidden sugar, one must read productlabels.The classic example of an industry buying research thatsuits its needs involves the tobacco industry. Although theydon't produce a food item, they illustrate the point soclearly that it':, worth our attention.The evidence that the smoking of cigarettes is harmful isoverwhelming.Virtually no one contests it, except thetobacco industry. They do everything they can (advertise,sponsor poorly designed research studies, lobby in Congress)to counter their increasingly bad image. Industry spokes-persons commonly cite \"eminent researchers\" who disputeclaims that smoking is bad for your health. Conclusiveevidence just isn't there, they say. The reason they can saythat with half a straight face is the result of so much badresearch that has been sponsored by the tobacco industry. Itallows people to cite this study or that study in support oftheir contentions that the ill effects of smoking on healthare not proven. The tobacco industry has to do this forsurvival.Let's look at why people smoke and what it does to thehuman body.People usually start to smoke in their teenageyears due to peer pressure. And even though it might appear 31 30that smoking is of no real physiological value to the smoker,other than keeping him/her from overeating throughout thecourse of the day, it does have one supposedly beneficialeffect.The nicotine in cigarette smoke is a stimulusbarrier, making it easier for the smoker to shut outdistractions.This has been indicated in human and animalstudies.For example, rats given nicotine were not asresponsive to heat as rats which did not get nicotine.Further, when a habitual smoker stops smoking cold turkey,his/her brain's response to stimuli (as measured byelectr-encephalograph electrodes on the head) becomes greaterthan it would have been if smoking were never begun in thefirst place.That makes it even more difficult for the ex-smoker to concentrate.Smoke contains many chemicals that harm the body inseveral ways.The specific effects of smoking are asfollows. 1.Nicotine constricts the blood vessels, increasing bloodpressure and making the heart work harder to supply thebody's cells.It also causes an increase in blood lipids(fats). 2.Carbon monoxide in smoke creates an hypoxic (low oxygen)state by binding with hemoglobin in place of oxygen.Hypoxia generates free radicals, which era reactivemolecules that can damage artery walls. Carbon monoxidealso uses up the body's supply of vitamin C. 32 31 3.The gas, nitrogen oxide, is carcinogenic. 4.Tars are chemicals in smoke that are carcinogenic, andthey can damage arterial walls, leading to heart disease. 5.Acetaldehyde is a toxic chemical known to be a cross-linker.As mentioned earlier, a cross-linker is asubstance that causes uncontrolled, abnormal bondsbetween molecules. Wrinkled skin, hardening of thearteries, and emphysema are conditions caused, in largepart, by cross-linking. 6.Lead, arsenic, and polonium are heavy metes whichinterfere with certain enzyme reactions in the body. Thebody's vitamin C is used up in protecting against thesemetals. 7.Nitrates and nitrites form carcinogenic nitrosamines.Vitamin C is used up in blocking the formation ofnitrosamines. 8.The function of cilia is hampered. Cilia are hairs inbronchial tubes which keep foreign matter out of thelungs. 9.Smoke directly from the burning tobacco contains morecarcinogenic materials than the smoke inhaled by thesmoker.There is evidence which suggests that it couldbe more dangerous to be around a smoker than to be asmoker.It is a natural human rear 'n to fight to save one'slivelihooeven at the expense of the public's health.33 32Th.se people who have a vested interest in an issue will dowhat they can to protect that interest. When a person takesa position on an issue, one needs to know if that person s'asanything to gain from that position, so one can better judgethe objectivity of the person's thinking. The food andtobacco industries have much to gain from the publicperception that the consumption of their products is okay.Any research sponsored by them and other vested interests(including the health food industry) must be viewed withsuspicion.Although the influence of the food industry on theacademic community might be substantial, sometimes leading tointellectual dishonesty, there are other possible reasons forthe publication of invalid research. One must understand thetremendous pressure on university faculty to \"publish orperish.\"In order to attain tenure at most universities, andto maintain one's position in good standing after gettingtenure, professors must publish research and attractfavorable attention from colleagues at other universities.There is only so much publication space to go around,however, and the competition for that space can be intense.Because many journals receive many more manuscripts thanthey can publish, some have established a policy of notpublishing papers which do not produce results attained atthe l% or 5% level of confidence (that means that there iseither a 99% or 95% assurance that the results did not occur 34 33due to chance). Therefore, if a professor spends severalmonths doing experimental research in which the experimentaltreatment yielded no significant effect on whatever was beingstudied, the professor may have wasted all that time andeffort, since his study might not be published. One has towonder how often research results are deliberately \"fudged\"in order to meet the known journal policy. One also has towonder about professors who establish reputations by pilingup great numbers of publication credits. What is the qualityof the research, both in terms of its validity and itsconsequence to the profession? Was it done mainly toestablish an impressive publication record, or was it done tosatisfy a need in the profession?Researchers probably make mistakes quite fregnently inthe design and conduct of studies, and that leads to manyfalse conclusions and conflicting results. One would hopethat any errors in research methods and the judgments theyinfluence could be dismissed as honest mistakes. There i.--,certainly much room for that to be, given the complexitiesinvolved in the workings of the human body, But, humannature tells us that dishonesty is probably involved, toopossibly to a significant degree. And that might lead one toask why it can't he stamped out, if it really does exist tothe extent indicated here. The problem lies withprovability.Intellectual dishonesty in nutrition researchcannot be proved any more than it can be proved that college 35 34athletes take cash payments for playing at their schools.Unless one or both parties confesses to the deed you '-avenothing, legally. All you have is he strong suspicion thatit must be going on.Physicians, dieticians, teachers, and other people ofinfluence usually base their beliefs on books and articleswhich, in turn, are based on research studies. They have todepend on the authors to present valid references, becausethe reader usually has no means to do that on his/her own.How can one be sure that the author carefully evaluated thestudies presented, or even has the expertise to do so?That's a good question for which there is no real answer.POINT NUMBER THREE: DOGMATISM INTERFERES WITH THEPURSUIT OF TRUTHDogmatism probably plays a significant role in theresearch and discussion of any issue. Once a person forms afirm opinion on something, and openly expresses it, itbecomes very difficult to reverse it. One tends to look forevidence that supports one's view, and ignore or malignevidence that opposes one's view. It's just human nature todo so, and I'm not immune to it either. Furthermore, thesame research results are subject to individualinterpretation. Stimulated by the writings of Dr. LinusPauling on the effects of vitamin C on the common cold.studies have been done to either confirm or deny hisassertion that a relatively high daily consumption of thevitamin prevents colds. The results seem to indicate that 36 35the taking of from one to five grams of vitamin C per day hasno statistically significant effect on the occurrence ofcolds when compared to a control group. But, advocates ofvitamin C supplementation use the same studies to reach adifferent conclusion. They point out that the takers ofvitamin C had much milder symptoms which resulted insignificantly fewer visits to the doctor's office and fewerdays lost from wJ1 k.It is suspected by some that a perfectly valid piece ofresearch cap go unpublished because the findings do notconform to the beliefs of the people reviewing the paper.The peer review board's job is to judge a paper in severalareas:(1)is the experimental design acceptable? (2)isthe description of materials used and experimental methodadequate for other researchers to duplicate the study?(3) are the conclusions reached justified relative to thedata presented? Whether or not the review board likes theresults should be irrelevant.From the researcher's standpoint, I wonder how oftenpeople enter a study with an \"axe to grind.\" How often arethey out to prove that such and such is true or not true?Ideally, a researcher wants to take a disinterested view ofthe results, but that probably doesn't happen very often.How embarrassing it would be for someone who has voiced astrong opinion on an issue, to produce research results thatrun counter to that opinion. It would take a strong, non- 37 36dogmatic ,erson to submit such results for publication.Let's look at a specific issue which might illustrate howdogmatism can enter into the dispute over the worth ofnutritional supplements. For years and years now, themedical profession, the American Heart Association, agenciesof the federal government, and the food industry have beentelling us that one of the major causes of heart disease isan excess consumption of saturated fat and cholesterol.Actually, heart disease has a multi-faceted cause (stress,lack of exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption), but we hearmost about cholesterol intake. There is plenty of evidenceto suggest that cholesterol intake is not the major culpritin the cause of heart disease; yet, the aforementionedorganizations keep pounding away at it, apparently ignoringthe one big factor that appears to be most significantthe nutritional status of the body's cells.Cholesterol is actually a beneficial substance, and thebody produces its own cholesterol in the liver andintestines.It is involved in many body processes, such ashormone production, vitamin D synthesis just below the skin,nerve impulse conduction, and so forth. Within reasonablelimits, the body usually adjusts its cholesterol productionto the amount that a person eats. High cholesterol intakeleads to lower body production, and vice versa. Some yearsago, many studies were done which concluded that a diet highin cholesterol leads to high blood cholesterol, and that high 38 37blood cholesterol is highly associated with the onset ofheart disease. Under certain conditions that is true, but itdoesn't explain at least two facts. First, because of allthe notoriety that a high-saturated fat diet has gotten inthis country, egg, butter, and animal fat consumption hasbeen down for decades, yet the incidence of heart disease hasincreased over that same period. Second, groups of peoplearound the world have been identified as having highsaturated fat diets, yet a low incidence of heart disease.Eskimos and thg. Punjabis of Northern India are tw, suchgroups.The traditional Eskimo diet is raw fat and meat,with the fat comprisi.-4 90% of the calories. The Punjabiseat nineteen times more fat than Southern Indians, yet theirrate of heart disease is seven times less. Furthermore, thePunjabis eat primarily saturated fat, where the SouthernIndians eat mainly unsaturated vegetable oils. How can allthis be,if saturated fat intake leads to heart disease? Theanswer must be that there are other factors involved.How does heart disease probably develop? Atrerosclerosis(technical name for heart disease) occurs when plaques(tumors) form on artery walls. Materials tend to collect onthe plaques, with cholesterol being one of the materials.Further, blood clots form on the plaques, and they can breakoff and lodge themselves in a narrower artery, totally block-ing off the blood supply of that artery to the heart or 39 38brain.When that happens in the braih, itis called astroke.Several related mechanisms combine in causingatherosclerosis to occur. Free radicals, formed from fatoxidation and other processes, are capable of initiatingplaque formation. Furthermore, the peroxidized fats suppressthe very immune system which is designed to protcct thearteries from plaque formation. One would think that thehigher one's serum cholesterol, the better the chances ofcholesterol attaching to the wall of the arteries. That'snot necessarily so. It depends on which of the two types ofcholesterol predominates in one's bloodstream. Cholesterolis carried around in the blood in the form of a fat-proteinmolecule (lipoprotein). There are two types HDL (highdensity lipoprotein) and LDL (low density lipoprotein). LDIdeposits cholesterol onto tae artery walls and HDL removescholesterol from the artery walls. Factors involved inachieving a good HDL/LDL ratio are being female, exercise,not smoking, and a sound supply of nutrients in the body'scells.Because narrowed arteries make it more difficult forblood to go through, an hypoxic (low oxygen) state develops,which further influences the production of fi_e radicals andreduces the production of PGI-2. PGI-2 is a horr le thatnaturally prevents blood clot formation. When itis reducedin supply, the blood's platelets have a tenuency to sticktogether and form ;:lots. 40 39As long as a person's diet is good in other respects, theintake of saturated fat is not likely to lead toatherosclerosis. The taking of nutritional supplements seemsto offer further protection from the free radical damage thatleads to atherosclerosis. The anti-oxidant nutrients(vitamins A, C, E, B-1, B --5,B-6, amino acid cysteine, zinc,selenium) are particularly useful in that regard, as isclearly demonstrated in some animal experiments. In onestudy, two groups of rats were fed diets high in saturatedfat.Both groups got grossly overweight, with one groupgetting heart disease. The other group didn't get heartdisease, because its diet was heavily supplemented withnutrients.So the key to preventing heart disease seems toinvolve exercise and the eating of a good diet withnutritional supplementation. Whether or not one consumessaturated fa. should be of little consequence. Eggs are notbe be avoided. They are good food, even though they containcholesterol.The irony of the cholesterol and saturated fat scare isthat doctors, dieticians, and agencies recommend that one'sfat intake be more in the form of unsaturated fat. There isevidence to sty...port the idea that unsaturated fat is evenmore dangerous than saturated fat.Since unsaturated fat has in it more unsaturated fattyacids than saturated fat, there are more total -1pacesavailable for oxygen to attach to the carbon chain. 41 40When a fat becomes oxidized, it is then a potential freeradical.Free radicals have the potential to damage a cell'sDNA and destroy the functioning ofHOHHthe cell and/or form a cancerousH-C-C-C-C-0 1I111111cell.The process is usually0 H 0 0triggered by chemicals that getthat get into our bodies through inhalation, ingestion,and/or absorption. The chemical attacks the fatty acidsstored in the body, causirg them to be oxidized and turnedinto free radicals. Free radicals further cause damage tomolecules in a chain reaction that, unless stopped by theimmune system, leads to degenerative diseases, such ascancer, arthritis, and heart disease. Fat peroxidation isjust one of several avenues for free radical formation. Freeradicals can be formed directly from chemicals found in smokeand polluted air, from a chemical produced in the body as aresult of alcohol consumption (acetaldehyde), from radiation(sunlight and x-rays), from an environment of too high or toolow oxygen content, and from normal inabolic processes.There is evidence to support the idea that degenerativediseases can be prevented or slowed down by reducing one'sexposure to the damaging entities that cause them and byeating a good diet and taking nutritional supplemeg s. Theright nutrients in the right amounts substantially protectthe body by keeping the immune system healthy and by directlydeactivating free radicals. This has been indicated over and 42 41over through experimental studies, yet the medicalprofession, most nutritionists, and most government agencieswill not acknowledge that vitamia pills can be useful. Forinstance, selenium supplements alone can reduce cancerformation in animals by about 70%. People who live in citieswhere the drinking water is high in selenium have lowercancer rates than people in cities where the drinking wateris low in selenium. Because of those facts the NationalCancer Institute has recommended that people take a seleniumsupplement of about two hundred micrograms a day. Theinstitute has tried, without success, to get governmentagencies to also recommend the taking of a seleniumsupplement. Such a recommendation, however, means that thoseagencies would have to abandon their long-standing positionthat everything you need to be healthy can be gotten from awell-balanced diet. In large part, dogmatism seems toprevent them from doing so.POINT NUMPER FOUR: THE POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS OF GOVERN-MENT AGENCIES ARE INFLUENCED BY THE SAMEFACTORS THAT INFLUENCE NUTRITION RESEARCH.What the government tells us about nutrition must beviewed with a wary eye, because it is heavily influenced byvested interests, dogmatic thinking, and political pressures.The very same people who could be accused of just about\"working\" for the food industry advise and sit ongovernmental committees which have much influence on publicopinion and buying habits. They are suspected of simply 43 42\"parroting\" official food industry positions. That situationis compounded by the revolving door relationships that existbetween food companies and the very agencies that are chargedwith regulating them. It is common practice for a person tohold a position with a governmental regulating body for a fewyears, then take an executive position with a company thathe/she was formerly entrusted to regulate. As well, industrypeople often shift over to government service. Earl Butz,one time Secretary of Agriculture, hed previously served onthe board of directors of Ralston-Purina. Butz's predecessorat Agriculture was Clifford Hardin, and he was on the boardat Ralston-Purina after lea',ing the government. That's aconflict of interest, at least potentially, and it seems torun rampant throughout the government.The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy ofSciences il a quasi-governmental body which sets theRecommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for many of the knownnutrients.Daily intake of its recommended concentrations oftwelve vitamins and six minerals is believed to be sufficientto maintain adequate health in most individuals. For themost part, the Board makas its periodic determinations byanalyzing the nutrient content of what they consider to be awell-balanced diet, then addin/ a margin for safety. Thescientists on tha Board readily admit to uncertainties abouttheir recommendations and the methods used to reach them.They further recognize that their recommendations are not 44 43likely to establish maximum nutrient concentrations in thebody's cells, and they do not rule out potential advantagesfor moderate nutrient intake beyond their recommendations.The Board has its critics. Some scientists charge thatthe RDAs have nothing to do with optimal health, that theyare merely designed to prevent observable disease. There isplenty of research evidence which indicates that peoplegenerally need nutrient levels which are much higher than theRDAs, and that it is difficult to reach even RDA levelsthrough usual dietary intake.Is the Board purposely setting RDA standards at lowlevels?What accounts for the sometimes significantvariations in recommendations from one reporting period toanother (the Board publishes 2evised editions every sixyears)?What possible motive could the Board have inmanipulating RDA standards? Senator William Proxmire wasonce quoted as saying that the Food and Nutrition Board \"isboth the creature of the food industry and heavily financedby the food industry.\" He,as well as others, propose thatlow RDAs make the food industry's processed food look morenutritious than it is. A company can put on its productlabel numbers which indicate that the consumption of itsproduct meets \"x\" percentage of the U.S.RDA for the nutrientslisted.The lower the RDAs, the higher the percentages thatcan be claimed for a product.The RDA for vitamin C is 60 mg. That appears to be 45 44foolishly low. Consider that the National Research Councilestablishes nutrient requirements for laboratory animals.Several of the nutrient recommendations for animals rangefrom four to thirteen times that for humans. Moreover, thestandard lab chow put out by Ralston-Purina contains eighteentimes as much vitamin C as for humans; and for monkeys, theirchow is thirteen times higher in vitamin C than for humans.Supposedly, this is done in recognition of how importantvitamin C is to the health of animals, and as a result of theknowledge that humans, apes, guinea pigs, and one type of batand bird Ere the only animals THAT DO NOT produce vitamin Cin their own bodies. Animals such as goats, cows, sheep, anddogs make a human equivalent of about ten grams of vitamin Ca day.That's 10,000 mg, compared to the '30 mg recommendedby the RDAs.When stressful conditions occur, those animalsproduce several times the normal amount. Why should man'sneeds for vitamin C be any different? Even apes and monkeyscommonly consume one hundred times the vitamin C humans getin their diets.Vitamin C might be the single most important nutrientthat should be taken as a supplement, not only because humansdon't manufacture it, but because it has so many knownbeneficial effects. Many experiments have been done to showthat vitamin C stimulees the immune system to better killbacteria, viruses, cancer cells, and free radicals. Part ofthis effect is due to vitamin C's stimulating effect on the 46 45production of interferon (a substance produced by white cellswhich keeps viruses from penetrating the body's cells).Vitamin C also reduces serum cholesterol and reduces lipidformation on artery walls. It destroys seven chemicalsassociated with smoking and drinking, and it uses its anti-oxidant property to protect the nervous system from immediateand severe damage. The brain, spinal cord, and nervescontain a great deal of the very polyunsaturated fatDocosahexanoic Acid. The nervous system cells contain onehundred times the amount of vitamin C as is found in thecirculating blood. If they didn't, that fat would q._,icklyperoxidize.The government agency that probably has the mostsignificant effect on nutrition issues in this country isthe Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA isresponsible for protecting us from harmful drugs and harm-ful ingredients in food and drink. In its role as publicprotector from worthless products, the FDA has taken a strongstand against the concept of taking vitamin pills.In the 1960's, the FDA established the Recommended DailyAllowances (U.S.RDAs), which were based on the Food andNutrition Board's RDAs. The basic purpose of the U.S.RDAsis to Let an official governmental standard by whichproducts can be evaluated and regulated. In an attempt toprotect the unwary consumer from \"useless\" vitamin andmineral supplements, the FDA proposed a regulation that would47 46make vitamin pills in doses greater than 1.5 times theU.S.RDAs a prescription drug. That means a 100 mg vitamin Cpill would require a prescription. Many people in thiscountry routinely take vitamin C in doses of 500 mg or more.The FDA regulation further stipulated that no product couldbe classified as a food supplement if it exceeded thenutrient concentrations of the U.S.RDAs. Products containingbetween 100% and 150% of the U.S.RDAs were to be classifiedas non-prescription medications.The FDA went even further. It intended to absolutelyforbid any nutritional supplement company from making anyhealth claims about its product on the product label.Manufacturers could not suggest that the American diet wasnutritionally deficient; and, in place of any health claims,the following warning was to appear on the label.Vitamins and minerals are supplied in abundant amountsin the foods we eat. The Food and Nutrition Board ofthe National Research Council recommends that dietaryneeds be satisfied by foods. Except for persons withspecial medical needs, there is no scientific basisfor recommending routine use of dietary supplements.Fortunately, there was a storm of protest, both from thepublic and nutritional sci.mtists. Members of the Food andNutrition Board objected to having their reasoned opinionstaken out of context and promoted as absolute truths. Thereare too many variables involved to absolutely claim thatdaily intake of nutritional supplements is useless forapparently healthy people. The public was outraged that 48 47its individual nutritional needs were being determined andregulated by a governmen agency, and freedom to chooseits own course of action would be restricted. In responseto the massive public outcry, Congress blocked the FDAregulations.Subsequently, the FDA has been able to establish severalless threatening regulations, one of which prohibits thenutritional fortification of junk food and drink. Ifvitamin C were put into a soft drink, criminal action couldbe taken.Supposedly, the FDA doesn't want to condone orpromote the eating of junk foods by making them better foods;but, the popularity of junk food is not declining andprobably never will, regardless of what stance the FDA takesagainst them.So why not allow junk foods to become morenutritious?The FDA claims that taking vitamin C and B tablets is awaste of money because those vitamins are watsn. soluble andany excess is excreted in the urine. Water so1'ble vitaminscannot ne appreciably stored in the body, as can fat solublevitamins (A, D, E, K), so one must get them into the systemon a regular basis for good health to be maintained. It istrue that vitamins C and B are excreted in the urine, butthat does not mean they are not needed. It just means thatthe full dosage taken can't be fully utilized at the time.Interestingly, experiments have shown that supposedly excessintake of vitamin C protects people from infections and 49 48cancer of the urinary tract. In order to get the most outof, for instance, a 1,000 mg dose of vitamin C, it should betaken in smaller doses throughout the day. Percentage-wise,more of the vitamin will be utilized that way.When one attempts to saturate the body's cells withnutrients, through the taking of vitamin pills, there mustbe some thought given to the possibility of overdosing onvitamins, called hypervitaminosis. The FDA often cites thepotential for bodily harm in such instances. It is possibleto oversupply the body with nutrients, especially inchildren, where irreversible damage can result. But, thebody has ways of dealing with oversupply situations. Asnoted, when the cells are saturated with water solublevitamins B and C, the excess is simply excreted in the urinewith no a7parert harm. When saturation of the fat solublevitamins A, D,E, and K, occurs. excesses are stored in theliver, to be used when needed. Although an overdosesituation is possible with the fat soluble vitamins, it ishighly improbable. Symptoms of vitamin A toxicity typicallyoccur only after a single dose of 2,000,000 IU or prolongeddoses of more than 100,000 IU per day. the U.S.RDA forvitamin A is only 5,000 IU; so one would have to take twentytimes that amount for months before symptoms ofhypervitaminosis appeared. And, once the symptoms appear,the simple stoppage or reduction of int,Ace resolves the 49problem with no apparent harm. Few,if any, people have everdied from a vitamin overdose.The dangt.rs of hypervitaminosis are absurd when comparedto the daily mistakes made with prescription drugs andsurgery.Iatrogenic disease is a physician-caused phenomenonwhich accounts for 180,000 American deaths per year, not tomention the many other people who are injured. Itisestimated that fifty percent of all surgery done in thiscountry is unnecessary. Allergic reactions to antibioticskill thirty thousand people per year, and one American diesevery three days from aspirin. Furthermore, the taking ofdrugs actually increases the body's need for nutrients,because the enzymes that the liver uses to process the drugsout of the body depend on nutrients for effective function.For example, oral contraceptives elevate the body's needs forvitamins B-6, folic acid, C, and E. Extra vitamin C isrequired for aspirin. Vitamins A, D,K, and B-12 are neededto offset the taking of cholesterol-reducing drugs. And,illegal dr,igs, such as cocaine, use up vitamins A and C. Itseems that medical and governmental authorities should bemore alarmed at the prospects of drugs and surgery doing harmto the public than the intake of supplementary vitamins.The FDA seems to be a roadblock in relation to drugs,too.Their regulations are so strict for the approval of anew drug that many useful drugs never get to the marketplace.It takes about ten years and fifty-seven million 51 50dollars (as of 1982) to get a drug through all thedevelopment and testing that the FDA requires. Then, if anew use is found for the previously approved drug, thecompany cannot inform physicians, pharmacists, or consumersof the new use until the FDA goes through a lengthy approvalprocess.In the meantime, companies sometimes give upbecause of the expense, and doctors' patients die orneedlessly suffer.r)w, you might say it's good that the FDA is so careul.But,in reality, it might not be all that good. Dr.A.Schmidt, a former FDA commissioner says, \"...failure toapprove an important new drug can be as detrimental to thepublic health as the approval of a potentially bad drug.\"If, under less stringent regulations, the FDA were to approvea bad drug,it would become evident soon enough, and the drugwould be taken off the market. But, what would also happenis that the FDA's reputation would be damaged. It ispolitically safer to fail to pass a good drug than to allow abad drug to leak through the system, even though the gooddrug might save many, many lives, or at least reduce people'ssuffering.Dr. Herbert Ley, a former commissioner of theFDA, once said, \"the thing that bugs me is that the peupiethink the FDA is protecting them it isn't.What the FDAis doing and what the public thinks it's doing are asdifferent as night and day.\" One hay to believe that the FDAgenerally acts in the public interest; but, at times, the 52 51FDA's conservative approach seems to do more harm than good.Another federal agency, which you would think hasnothing to do with food and nutrition, has also gotten intothe act.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearmsprevents alcohol distillers from adding nutrients to theirproducts, which would make them safer for human consumption.A good many physicians and biochemists agree that suchsupplementation would significantly reduce the damagingeffects that alcohol has on the body.There are two related occurrences involved here. Onedeals with the kind of damage that alcohol does to the body.The other involves the circumstances that lead to a person'sbecoming a physiological alcoholic, as opposed to a psychicalcoholic.Psychic dependence is like wanting an ice creamcone every day, but your body doesn't really need it. Aphysical dependence, which is involved in true alcoholism,means that the body actually signals for the alcohol, just asyour body signals for food when you're hungry.One damaging effect of alcohol is the same as for sugar.Alcohol has no nutrients with which to process it through thebody, so alcohol must steal from the body's supply. That hasan effect over the 'ono' haul. There is, however, a moredramatic, short to effect t:Iatis clearly traceable.All humans make about one ounce of alcohol every day asa result of normal metabolism. In the liver, special enzymesmetabolize the alcohol into acetaldehyde. Left alone, 53 52acetaldehyde is a very dangerous substance. It can oxidizeto form free radicals, and free radicals can cause cross-linking, cancer, birth defects, atherosclerosis, braindamage, and so forth. The body has a system for getting t.idof the acetaldehyde, with enzymes turning it into a harmlesssubstance (acetate). However, the system can break down dueto a possible combination zf three factors long term heavydrinking, a deficient nutritional intake, and an inheritedmetabolic defect.People drink for essentially the same reason that peoplesmoke and take tranquilizers. Those substances act asstimulus barriers. They make people feel better than theyotherwise would. When a person drinks alcohol frequently,and in large quantities, acetaldehyde can be made faster thanthe body can get rid of it. Therefore, free radicals areproduced.The body can largely prevent damage from occurringif it has sufficient amounts of the right nutrients. In anexperiment, two groups of rats were given equal amounts ofacetaldehyde.Ninety percent of one group died, while in theother group, no rats died. The latter group got supplementaldoses of the vitamins B-1 and C and the amino acid cysteine.In the presence of a nutritional deficiency, continualalcohol intake breaks the system down to the point thatalcoholism results. The production of more and moreacetaldehyde develops into a physiological need for more and 54 535more alcohol.At least part of the process is due to thefact that alcohol, in itself, actually acts as a destroyer ofthe free radicals produced by the oxidation of theacetaldehyde. So,a vicious cycle results. Alcohol producesa problem, but the body wants more alcohol to help solve theproblem that the alcohol produced in the first place. And tomake matters worse, the alcoholic's caloric intake becomesdominated by alcohol rather than good food. So the alcoholicdrinks more and eats less, further compounding the problem.It's important to realize that alcoholism is not so mucha psychological problem, a problem of lack of will power, asit is a nutritional problem. In one experiment, three groupsof rats were fed diets that were either nutritionallydeficient, adequate, or superior. In each rat's cage weretwo containers of liquid one containing pure water and onecontaining a water-alcohol mixture. The nutritionallydeficient group of rats voluntarily drank mainly from thealcohol dish, while the well-fed rats didn't touch thealcohol at all. The middle group drank a moderate amount ofalcohol.The point is that man's biological desire foralcohol is affected by the nutritional status of his body'scells.It seems virtually impossible for a nutritionallyscund individual to become an alcoholic.Only five to ten percent of all regular drinkers becomealcoholics, but certain groups of people seem to have ahigher percentage than normal. The Irish and American Indian 55 54are two such groups. It has been found that these peoplehave a metabolic defect which makes them more susceptible toalcoholism.They have a higher than normal average ratio ofacetaldehyde-producing to acetaldehyde-destroying enzymes.So when they drink, those people have a tendency to producegreater than normal amounts of acetaldehyde, but they canonly destroy them at a slower than normal rate. Heredity isagainst them, so they definitely need nutritional protectionagainst the acoholic process.One final note on this subject: you might remember, inthe discussion about smoking, that tobacco smoke has in itacetaldehyde, among other chemicals. A great many peoplesmoke and drink, and the damaging effects of both togetherhave been found to be worse that additive. The risks ofcancer and heart disease go way up fur those people, as theircells' levels of the anti-oxidant nutrients go way down.More than anyone else, smokers and abusers neednutritional supplementation tc counteract that self-pollution.POINT NUMBER FIVE: BEWARE PROPAGANDA AND QUACKERYOrganizations and food companies publish literature onnutrition which supports their viewpoints. Pamphlets andbooklets often turn up at professional conferences. They aretargeted toward people (teachers, for example) who are inpositions to influence other people. For the most part, theinformation seems to be reliable. But, there are some 56 55instances where the information takes on a propaganda tone,supporting a nearly indefensible position which is to thebenefit of food companies which produce certain processedfoods.As an example, one can frequently find statements tothis effect: \"Nutritionally speaking, enriched breads areequivalent to whole grain.\" That statement was made by aprofessor of nutrition at Harvard University. It could havebeen made by many other \"experts\" in the field. Thestatement seems crazy when you look at what happens whenwhole grain is processed into what amounts to white flour.A whole wheat kernel has three parts endosperm(mostly starch), germ (contains most of the nutrients), andbran (outer covering of kernel, has nutrients and fiber).When the kernel is refined, most of the germ and bran aretaken out.The process produces an easier to digest flour,but it also produces a product which is deficientnutritionally and mechanically. The nutrient loss from theiroriginal concentrations, and only four (thiamine, riboflavin,niacin, and iron) are restored to their original values in 57 56the enrichment process. How can it be that enriched flour isas good as whole grain when fifteen nutrients are severelyreduced in supply, in most cases? Furthermore, much of thefiber is lost in refining, and while it is not a nutrient,per se, fiber is a mechanical necessity. It absorbs water asit passes through the digestive tract, making feces soft andeasier to eliminate. Fiber has also been found to absorbsome environmental pollutants, which are then carried out ofthe body.Too little fiber in the diet leads toconstipation, which means that the feces hang out in thecolon .onger than normal. Over the long haul, that can leadto problems such as diverticulosis and cancer of the colon.If refined flour is nutritionally equal to whole grain,why do bread manufacturers go to so much trouble to disguisethe fact that their products contain refined flour? Manybreads list as ingredients the words unbleached, enriched,fortified (four nutrients supplemented beyond the grain'soriginal quantity), wheat, and rye flour. The implication isthat the bread is not made with refined flour, but those areall refined flours. If the ingredients and the label do notsay 100% whole wheat or whole grain flour, then it's not thereal thing.A bread can be labeled (named) whole wheat breadand still have 49% refined flou in it.Another difficulty involves the significant amounts ofsugar that are injected into some breads. Ingredients on alabel are listed in order of quantity, such that the first58 57ingredient is most plentiful, the second is second-mostplentiful, and so forth. A little sugar is required to raisedough, but when extra sugar is put into bread to make ittaste better, manufacturers ofter. try to disguise the amountby using several kinds of sugars. They can then place themfurther down the list of ingredients than if only one sugarwere used.Corn syrup, maple syrup, raisin syrup, brownsugar, honey, malt, molasses, dextrose, sucrose, fructose,and glucose are all sugars, and they all have approximatelythe same detrimental effects on the body.Recent public concern over dietary fiber has led to theinjection of powdered wood pulp into some breads. Wood pulpabsorbs a lot of water, so the main ingredient of the breadturns out to be water. Furthermore, the human intestinaltract is not designed to handle wood pulp, so irritatedintestines could easily result from eating substantialquantities of that kind of bread. As a final insult, themanufacturers have put a high price on the bread, even though itis cheaper to make than regular bread. One might also besuspicious of dark breads, such as pumpernickel. For themost part, they are noting more than refined products thathave been colored with caramel. That makes them look morenutritious than they really are.In general, the same comments that were just made aboutbread could be made about cereals. You've got to read labelsto make sure what you're getting. Sugar is more of an issue 59 58with cereals than with bread, because we're talking abouthuge amounts, in some cases. Sugar Smacks ate 63.7% sugar,Sugar Pops are 40.7% sugar, and King Vitaman is 61.6% sugar.Even some of the more nutritious cereals have a suspiciouslylarge amount of sugar content. Heartland (a granola) has26.3%, Grape Nuts is 7.7%, Wheaties is 8.9%, and Total is9.4% sugar.Cereal companies are quick to counter anycriticism about sugar in cereal and any charges that sugar isdetrimental to one's health. General Mills puts out apamphlet which denies that sugar in cereals contributes totooth decay, cbesity, and other diseases.Thus far, this presentation has been heavily weighted infavor of what one might call the health food industry thepeople most responsible for selling nutritional supplementsto the public. Since they have something to sell, aren'tthey also guilty of many of the same things that have beenmentioned of the other side? The answer is yes. I'll citetwo instances.For years and years, an argument has raged between thescientific community and people who write articles forpopular nutrition magazines about the relative worth ofnatural and synthetic vitamins. Some writers have repeatedlyclaimed that natural vitamins are better than syntheticbecause they are better absorbed and utilized by the body.That statement is made despite irrefutable evidence andagreement among scientists that, for example, a synthetic 59vitamin C molecule (manufactured in a lab) is excctly thesame as the one made by a plant. Both have the samepotential for biological activity because the human bodycannot tell the difference. It could be argued that vitamin C,as well as some other nutrients, occurs in nature withother nutrients that enhance its biological activity. Thatis true, particularly in the case of vitamin C.Bioflavonoids accompany vitamin C in fruits andvegetables.When you peel an orange you note the white stuffon the inside of the skin that sticks onto the meat of theorange, and you probably try to get as much of it off aspossible before eating the orange. That's where most of thebioflavonoids are. It's not a good idea to take the whitestuff off completely, because the bioflavonoids significantlyenhance the biological activity of the ascorbic acid (vitamin C)in a synergistic relationship. That natural, synergisticeffect, however, is not limited to nature. It can bereproduced in the laboratory. So,a 150 mg vitamin C tabletwhich contains bioflavonoids can have equal or greaterbiological activity than a 500 mg tablet of vitamin C alone.The irony of the natural versus synthetic controversy isthat the natural product must, for economic reasons, be morethan 95% synthetic. Have you ever noticed on the label of avitamin C bottle this wording: 500 mg of ascorbic acid withacerola cherries or with rose hips? You would think it ouldsay from either one. There's a good reason for that. 61 60There is so little vitamin C in natural sources that it wouldcost more than a dollar per gram to extract it from plants.That would make the cost of purely natural vitamin Cprohibitive.Therefore, the \"natural\" vitamin manufacturersmust resort to a nearly 100% synthetic product anyway.Adding five percent natural source allows them to call itnatural, and it adds to the cost.Another example of a substance which the body needs, butcannot tell the difference between the natural and syntheticversions,is Na-PCA.It was once believed that skin was keptsoft because of its oil content. Actually, it's the watercontent of the skin that makes it soft; and the substance inthe skin that holds the water in is Na-PCA. The body makesits own, but if your body doesn't make enough (this happenswhen you age), or you wash your hands too frequently (theNa-PCA washes away), you can add it to the skin externally.The body can't tell the difference between its own Na-PCA andthat which is contained in scme moisturizing creams.N, cural food proponents have a tendency to reject theidea of putting preservatives in food. \"If it isn't natural,it can't be good.\" Actually, food preservatives serve a veryhealthful purpose. Withoit them, food could not be safelystored and transported and consumed by us. BHT and BHA aretwo such preservatives. They are anti-oxidants because theyprevent fats and oils from becoming rancid (oxidized intomutagens and carcinogens by oxidants such as oxygen, ozone, 62 61and free radicals). BHT and BHA are added both to the foodand the packaging materials that surround them, and any toxiceffects that they might have (and in the quantity typicallyconsumed there really are none) are far, far less of a threatto health than food which is spoiled or contains bacteria andmold.Common preservatives which can be found on foodlabels, and which can prevent the formation of powerfultoxins such as botulism and aflatoxin, in our foodPOINT NUMBER SIX: A WELL-BALANCED DIET NECESSARILY IT DOESN'T BENEFIT ALLPEOPLE EQUALLYMost doctors, dieticians, nutritionists, andgovernmental agencies claim that nutritional supplementsaren't necessary as long as a well-balanced diet is eaten.There are at least eight weaknesses in that position. 1.A well-balanced diet is considered to be one in which aperson eats from the four asic food groups on a dailybasis.Although it is recommended that foods be consumedas much as possible it their natural states, foods suchas mashed potatoes, canned and frozen vegetables, whitebread, and processed cereals are all considered to be apart of a well-balanced diet. Yet, they arenutritionally deficient when compared to food in its 6 A 62original state. In that light, a well-balanced diet isnot necessarily the best diet a person could eat. So,people who think they are eating well might not he eatingas well as they could for optimal health. Nutritionalsupplements could make up the difference. 2.Closely related to the above comment is this question.Practically speaking, how many people actually eat awell-balanced diet? Since the United States is one ofthe world leaders in the incidence of degenerativedisease,itis reasorible to suspect that hardly anyonedoes.This is the case despite constant urging by thehealth and medical communities tc, eat good food. Ifpeople, in general, are not eating well-balanced diets,(and there is good reason to suspect that they neverwill), doesn't it make sense to advocate the taking ofnutritional supplements? 3.Even if one eats a natural foods diet, the nutrientcontent of \"fresh\" fruits and vegetables has gone downover the years. Some crops are picked prematurely sothey won't spoil by the time they are presented to us inthe grocery store. Fruits and vegetables must mature onthe plant or tree to maximize their nutrient contents.Furthermore, even crops ricked at maturity (lettuce, forexample) begin to lose some of their original vitamin Ccontent as soon as they are cut or picked. 64 63 4.Personal circumstances have an influence on people'snutritional needs. If you could take two people who areexactly alike in every way, and who eat what would beconsidered the perfect diet, and place them intodifferent lifestyle situations, would they not eventuallybecome different in the nutritional status cf theirrespective body's cells? If one of the two were subject-ed to years of pollution and stress, while the other werenot, surely their relative health statuses would becomedifferent eventually. It would seem that the only waythe \"stressed\" individual could retain nutritionalequality with the other is to take nutritionalsupplements.When you consider that virtually no oneeats a perfect diet, and that virtually everyoneencounters nutrient-depleting circumstances throughouthis/her lifetime, it seems foolish to think that optimalhealth and longevity could be attained without takingsupplements. 5.Nowhere in nature has there ever been found an organismwhich gets optimal nutrition from its natural environ-ment.Experimental results indicate this.For example, a plant which receives a certain concentra-tion of carbon dioxide in nature can be taken into alaboratory and given a higher than normal concentrationof carbon dioxide. The plant grows faster and bigger.Plants given ideal sunlight, temperature, water, and 65 64minerals also grow better. Why would man be anydifferent?Why would he be singled out in nature to getoptimal nutrition from his environment? Even rats, whichmanufacture their own vitamin C, have been shown tobenefit from vitamin C supplements. In stress experi-ments, rats given vitamin C survive greater stresses thanthose who do not get it. It appears that nutrition canalways be improved. 6.It is a well-known medical observation that people whosuffer from vitamin deficiency diseases, such as scurvyand pellagra, often develop a rather permanent need forthe deficient nutrient at a higher than normal level.Once pellagra victims are treated to the point theirsymptoms disappear, they must ingest about thirty timesthe U.S.RDA for niacin per day for years to prevent therecurrence of their symptoms. Pernicious anemia victimsmust consume about sixty times the U.S.RDA for vitaminB-12 to remain healthy, and scurvy victims must take inmore than twenty times the U.S.RDA for vitamin C. Veryfew people in this country ever develop a singularvitamin deficiency disease; but, it is likely that manypeople experience significant periods of what could becalled sub-clinical deficiencies, whereby one'snutritional status is definitely sub-optimal andbordering on a recognizable deficiency state. It may bethat long-term sub-clinical deficiencies also stimulate a 65permanent elevation in nutritional needs needs thatcan't be satisfied by diet alone. 7.You've heard the phrase, \"one man's food is another man'spoison.\"We know instinctively that each person isdifferent from the next, but it's interesting to focus onthe degree to which that is so. The size and shape ofevery organ in the body is not necessarily as standard asseen in an anatomy book. Tremendous differences existbetween people. Have you ever wondered how a smallperson could eat more food than a bigger person? Thelikely reason is that the small person's stomach islarger than average, while the larger person's stomachis smaller than average. There may be two, three, orfour arterial branches coming off a person's aorta. Amuscle in the hand might insert to two fingers instead ofjust one, making it impossible for the person to moveeither finger individually. There are also differencesin people's abilities to digest, absorb, and utilize thefood they eat. That means that two people could eatexactly the same diet but get entir ly differentnutritional benefits. THIS IS A M)R, MAJOR POINT.Those who advocate chat one need only eat a well-balanceddiet to be healthy assume that one's food isautomatically processed through the body. It isn't.Tremendous differences exist in people's metaboliccapacities. 67 66 8.Related to the previous point is the concept of bio-biochemical individuality. Experiments have beenconducted in which animals have been fed and treatedexactly alike, yet their growth rates and lifespansvaried widely. Practically speaking, no two people arealike in nutritional needs. We all need tne samenutrients, but it is likely that almost everyone hasunusually high needs for one or more nutrients. Thinkback to the food handling mistakes that led to scurvy,beriberi, and pellagra. Many people died from thosediseases, but not all, because some people's needs forthiamine, niacin, or vitamin C were not gr,:_t -'nough tobe fatally affected by the deficiency io the food. Myneed for calcium might be five, ten, or twenty times thatof someone else. Since nutrients work as a team, theconsistent under-supply of just one nutrient can lead todegenerative disease. Because of that probabili,y, itmakes sense to take nutritional supplements as aninsurance policy against the biochemical individualityfactor, A CONCLUDING COMMENTThrough the thousands of years man has been on thisplanet he has eaten the food, that nature p,-ovides. Althoughthe nutrition nature provides can be improved upon, it issilly to think that we can go in Cie opposite direction with 66 67impunity.The processing of food, although advantageous inmany ways, hurts us. We cannot possibly get the samenutritional benefits from processed foods as from naturalfoods.Nowadays, people who eat natural foods and takenutritional supplements are thought to be health nutspeople who are on some sort of crazy diet. Isn't itinteresting how things can get turned around? If we were totake a frozen TV dinner up into the mountains of NorthernIndia and tell the Hunzaa that this is good food, they wouldthink we were crazy.The most stable population groups throughout history haveeaten from five food groups mostly grains; a slightlysmaller amount of vegetables; a smaller amount. of legumes(peas, beans, lentils, peanuts); yet smaller amounts ofseeds, nits, and fruits; and varying amounts of animal fleshand products.Generally, the food has been consumed in itsnatural state. In the times in which we live, theprobabil4.ty of our eating truly good diets is remote. Ourlifestyles generally don't permit it. Although we should tryto eat good food in reasonablr variety, to exercise incarrying out our daily duties, to eat only when our bodiessignal for food, to avoid emotional stress, and to avoidenvironmental and self-pollution of our bodies, we oftencan't do those things very well. Simply harping about eatingwell-balanced diets isn't going to cut it. We probably neednutritional supplements to defend ourselves from ourselves. 69 68But, there is a caution. Good health and longevitydepend on many facto:s, with cellular nutrition being justone of those factors. Furthermore, the taking of nutritionalsupplements is not license to ignore good eating habits. Onemust always strive to eat the best food that one'scircumstances will allow. The reasonable goal of anynutritional supplemental regimen should be to saturate thebody's cells with all the nutrients to allow the cells tofunction at maximum efficiency. It must be understood thatthe attainment of that goal provides no guarantee of immunityfrom disease or cure of disease. There are limitations tothe preventive and healing powers of the human body, evenwhen supplied with ideal ma*erials. Some damage isunavoidable and irreversible. Since the health benefits fromnutritional supplementation must necessarily vary from oneindividual to another, the only certainty involved withcellular saturation is that good health won't be limitedbecause one's cells are not supplied with optimal levels ofthe nutrients they need.Although the medical profession and most scientistsstrongly question the value of nutritional supplementationfor most people, one can look back in history and find manyinstances where unorthodox ideas that contradicted thenotions of scientific truth held by academicians andbureaucrats later became accepted practice. There is noproof, beyond doubt, that the taking of vitamin pills will 70 69benefit the human population as a whole. But, there is goodreason to suspect that supplements might help mostpeople.So what are we to do wait for the proof to comein, if it ever does? In the meantime, we could be needlesslyshortening the quality and length of our lives. Anyone whopersonally dismisses the value of taking vitamin pills isreally saying one of two things -- that his/her food intakeand lifestyle allows the body's cells to enjoy optimalconcentrations of all the nutrients they need (a highlyunlike:y circumstance); or, that he/she doesn't particularlycare whether or not the cells are maximally nourished.Taking vitamin pills is a simple, inexpensive, and virtuallyharmless undertaking. Doesn't it make sense to offer ourbodies nutritional insurance? 70 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Ballentine, Rudolph, M.D. NUTRITION: A HOLISTICAPPROACH.Himalayan International 1978.2. Benowicz, Robert J.
