There are over 300,000 long haul truck drivers ( LHTD ) in Canada ; 46,000 registered in Alberta. Over the past decade, the shortage of LHTD has become more pronounced due to challenges recruiting new drive rs and retaining older experienced drivers in the workforce, in part due to the perceived and actual health and wellness conditions of LHTD. Truck drivers are considered a n at-risk population due to the high rates of disease that are impacted by increasing age, unhealthy lifestyle factors and the environment . Long haul truck drivers (LHTD) often work long shifts with little opportunity for physical activity, are stressed and fatigued , lack access to nutritious meals, work in isolation, and are exposed to noise and constant vibration. As a result, LHTD have high rates of chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease , and have an average life expectancy of 12-20 years lower than the general population. While addressing health and wellness are important considerations for LHTD and their employees, simultaneously understanding the environmental conditions that impact health and wellness are equa lly as important. To date, there have been a limited number of research studies on LHTD in Canada. Data on Canadian LHTD is needed to determine the predominant health conditions inherent in this population with associated risk factors, and contextual facto rs that influence health and wellness decisions. This type of data is needed for the development of novel interventions that address health issues in Canadian LHTD. The overall purpose of this project was to collect data on the health and wellness, lifesty le and working conditions of LHTD. To address this goal, t his study addressed the following objectives: 1) to describe the health, lifestyle Classification: Publicii practices, working conditions, quality of life and job satisfaction of truck drivers ; 2) to identify correlates and predictors of poor health, accidents (motor vehicle collisions, falls), quality of life and worker compensation claims ; and 3) to describe the truck stop environment including food options and amenities (e.g., showers, exercise equipment). Methods The project team recruited LHTD from five truck stop s in Alberta (i.e., Lloydminster, Edmonton (two different truck stops), Red Deer and Calgary ) over 6 consecutive weeks, and two truck stops in Saskatoon . The research team had a designated booth at each tr uck stop from 4 :30- 10:30pm and approached drivers as they entered the truck stop. Drivers were informed of the study and were asked if they were interested in participating. Interested participants were then screened for study inclusion. Any driver that identified themselves as a LHTD ; drove a truck with three or more axles in the past year, and t ook at least one mandatory 10 -hour rest period away from home or would be required to do so on the current trip were eligible to participate in the study. Interested and eligible participants could complete up to three distinct study phases: 1) a survey; 2) health measurements; and 3) a semi -structured interview. The survey included questions on demographics, employment information and history (e.g. type of LHTD, km driven per year), training, company safety climate (e.g. dispatching, scheduling, incentives), health behaviours (e.g. smoking, diet, exercise, sleep) , diagnosed chronic diseases and related medications , crashes and work -related injuries, and safe ty related questions (e.g. seat belt use, speeding) . The health measurements consisted of assessing height and weight, blood pressure, fat composition and grip strength using objective measures. The semi -structured interview asked questions to gain an in-depth understanding of work and environmental factors not captured in Classification: Publiciii the survey. The interviews were recorded, transcribed , and analyzed using NVivo while survey and health measurement data was entered into SPSS (IBM, version 25) for statistical analysis. Results In total, 238 participants completed the survey , 200 completed objective health measurements and 92 participated in the interviews. The mean age of the total sample was 50.6\u00b112.4 years (range 23 to 89 years ); 96% were men . The average number of kilometers driven in the past 12 months by LHTD were 170,890 km and over half of the drivers drove over 175,000 km/year. Approximately 67.2% of the sample worked for a company while 26.9% were owner operators that leased or made payments on their truck and 6% owned their own truck. Sixty four percent of drivers wor ked for very small or small companies , defined as having less than 100 employees. About three quarters of the sample received benefits; 62.4% had health insurance from their employer or union and 54.9% received paid vacation time, respectively. A quarter (25%) of LHTD had access to Workers' Health Promotion programs and 44% of companies provided safety incentives/awards. Three -quarters of LHTD were satisfied with their job although there were many issues reported including long working hours (9.7%) , missing family events (72%), having an unhealthy lifestyle (85%), and general safety (56%). About 57% of LHTD had received prior truck driver training. Those who did not receive formal driver training were significantly more likely to crash than those w ho had received training. Participants stated during the interviews that current training standards are inadequate for the industry, particularly for new drivers. According to participants, entry -level curriculums should consist of both classroom and pract ical training, as well as on -road observation with a senior mentor. The LHTD reported that many new drivers are not equipped to drive in various contexts and settings (e.g., mountains, slippery roads). Classification: Publiciv The findings show that LHTD have high rates of chronic disease and risk factors for chronic disease. For example, 89.5% were overweight or obese , 16% were diabetic, 23.4% ha d hypercholesterolemia, 36.2% stressed and 40% were depressed. Additionally, 34% of LHTD reported suffering from fatigue, and 21.5% from lack of sleep . Moreover, 54% of LHTD smoked, 98% were pre -hypertensive or had hypertension, over 90% reported eating poorly and 54.5% were sedentary. The finding s show that 33% of LHTD were involved in a recordable truck crash in the last 12 months (n=64) , most of th em being at -fault (82%). Be ing involved in a crash was significantly associated with older age (p<0.001), greater driving experience (p<0.001), poorer grip strength (p=0.03) , less caffeine intake (p=0.011) , fewer hours sleeping at the truck stop (p=0.03) , being diabetic (p=0.039) , having high blood cholesterol (p=0.04) and not having company safety rewards (p=0.025) . Additionally, crashes were significantly associated with diabetes and high cholesterol (p< 0.05). Approximately 30% of LHTD that were involved in a crash suffered injuries and required medical treatment; 84% of them missed work although only 20% f iled a worker's compensation claim (75% of being successful). Just over 10% of LHTD reported being injured while working and were require d to visit a doctor. Falls occurred in 27% of the sample and resulted in 41% of all injuries at work. F alls were significantly associated with having a sedentary lifestyle (p=0.045) and not having participated in c lassroom training related to fall preventi on (p=0.013) . The findings also showed that musculoskeletal disorders are common among LHTD (37.5%) ; the most common injury was to the back (45%). More than a third (36%) of LHTD reported to have persistent low back pain during the past 3 months. Low back pain was significantly associated with smoking (p=0.008) , being depressed (p=0.006) health Classification: Publicv benefits (p=0.016) or access to employee health promotion programs (p=0.040) , as well as the employer's lack of w ritten polices and safety measures (p=0.041) . A large proportion of drivers (88%) reported difficult ies finding parking while on duty. Over two third of drivers reported o f severe parking shortage, even those who were familiar with Alberta's highways and truck stops . Due to parking difficulties, LHTD reported going beyond their hours of service , were forced to park on the highway shoulder or on side roads that were unlit and potentially unsafe (fears of vandalisms or robbery). From the interviews, LHTD revealed that m ore truck stops, and rest areas were needed. Additionally, existing truck stops should be enhanced to provide amenities such as showers, laundry, and internet access, as well as exercise equipment if possible. Other suggestions for improving health and wel lness include having designated truck lanes on highways, being paid by the hour (rather than mile), enforcing strict traffic laws and speed limits for both truckers and cars, and reducing hours of regulations might significantly help to improve safety in t rucking industry. Discussion and Recommendation s Our findings are comparable to prior Canadian studies that examined the health and wellness of LHTD. We found that LHTD are around the age of 50 years with most being predominantly male. Additionally, we also found many LHTD were obese, sedentary, smoked, and had a poor diet, which was also found in prior Canadian studies (Bigelow et al. , 2012 ; Angeles et al. , 2014 ), as were the prevalence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular d isease, diabetes, and sleep apnea. Compared to US data (Sieber et al. , 2014 ), the findings were also similar. For example, a similar proportion smoked ( 51% vs. 54%) , were aged 50 years and (45.1% vs. 47.8% ), were overweight or obese (90% versus had (21.7% vs. 23.4%), diabetic (14.4% vs. 16%) Classification: Publicvi disease (4.1% vs. reported issues with fatigue (26.5% vs. 21.5%) . However, the Canadian sample , compared to the US data , had much higher rates of hypertension (73.9% vs 26.3%) and sedentary exercise behaviours (54.5% vs 27.1%). While only 28% of the participants reported having diagnosed hypertension, our objective blood pressure measurement found that almost three -quarters of the participants were hypertensive at time of assessment . Regardless, the rates of chronic disease in Canadian LHTD, as well as their associated risk factors, are much higher compared to the general Canadian population ( CCHS , 2017 ). These findings confirm that LHTD are indeed a vulnerable group that requires fu rther attention by government and policy makers. Given the high prevalence of preventable disease and its associated risk with crashes and injuries, Alberta should consider having LHTD undergo an annual medical checkup with physicians associated with the A lberta Motor Transport Association (AM TA). Presently, CMV drivers in Alberta are required to provide a self -report of any medical conditions that may impact driving performance every five years. However, it is well known that drivers are unlikely to self - report conditions that may impact drivin g licensure or employment . In the USA, LHTD are required to undergo a medical every two years and is mandatory in order to retain a truck driver license. In Ontario and B ritish Columbia, new truck drivers are required to undergo a medical examination prior to entering the profession, and every 3 years after the age of 45, and every year after the age of 65 years . Meanwhile, the National Safety Code (2020) suggest that truck drivers be screened for medical conditions every 5 years up to age 45, every 3 years between the age of 45 and 65 years, and annually from age 65. The LHTD also mentioned that they are not satisfied with the current training guidelines for novice truck drivers. They mentioned that a standardized process administered by one Classification: Publicvii recognized organization (e.g. AMTA ) should be considered. As 33% of the sample were involved in crashes at an average age of 36 years, training is critically important. In our study, those who did not receive formal training were more likely to crash, underscoring the necessity for mandatory training. The LHTD were skeptical of classroom -exclusive training and believed the current training programs do not adequately prepare new drivers for the profession. Instead, LHTD suggested that a practical component be included in the training program, consisting of new drivers spending time with a seasoned driver and learning how to drive (e.g. braking, reversing) in big cities and rural areas, as well as in different driving conditions (ice, mountains). They mostly suggested that the length of the training program sh ould be at least between 8 -12 weeks. In Alberta, the mandatory entry -level training program includes training hours for in - class ( 58.5 hours ), hours ) (Government of Alberta, 2019 ). Findings from both the survey and the interview show concern over the shortage of truck stops and rest areas in the province. Almost 90% of the LHTD reported not being able to find parking with many spending hours in search for parking spots. In fact, almost 50% reporting losing 1-2 hours on every trip trying to find parking, despite 88% of the sample being familiar with the truck stops and highways routes in Alberta. In an industry where LHTD are paid by the mile, spending 1 -2 hours on each trip in a city trying to find parking increases stress, decreases earning potential and timely deliveries, as well as places LHTD at risk for accidents, robberies and vandalism (from parking on highway shoulders or unlit side roads). To address this issue, the Alberta Government, in collaborat ion with the AM TA, should identify where fatigue related crashes occur or where distances between rest stops are greater than 200 km, and consider Classification: Publicviii implementing new rest stops and/or truck stops, in addition to expanding the parking structures of current tr uck stops. Given the volume of LHTD that visit truck stops, and the importance th at truck stops provide to LHTD, truck stops need to be as welcoming as possible and provide amenities that support the health and wellness of LHTD. The LHTD reported wanting better access to healthy fresh foods that are affordable. They also reported that restaurants in truck stops generally have processed foods for purchase with healthy foods (e.g. fruits and vegetables) being unreasonably expensive. Access to healthy foods is compounded by the limited opportunity LHTD have to stop in cities to buy healthy foods at grocery stores. Often, trucks are too big to drive on city roads and park in smaller grocery store parking lots, in addition to the time required to purchase foods (due to hours of service regulations). For this reason, many LHTD reported eating unhealthy foods simply because it is easy to access (along the routes). Future projects should develop innovative methods for providing healthy foods to truck drivers while on the road, whether that's changing the menu options at truck stops, or finding a way to deliver foods to the drivers at a reasonable cost when at the truck stops. Conclusions Truck d rivers account for an essential working body of the economy . Improvements in the health and wellness of LHTD can only serve to improve recruitment and retention in a sector that is currently facing a shortage. It is important to note that LHTD reported many positive aspects to working in the industry such as the freedom a truck driver provides, driving across different regions and meeting new people. Addressing the concerns of LHTD will only serve to improve the working conditions and t he health and wellness for drivers in this industry. For a sector as large as the LHTD industry, which is vulnerable to developing chronic health Classification: Publicix conditions, actions are needed to address the present problems. Many of the issues related to diet (access to healthy f oods), exercise, chronic fatigue, can be improved through systemic change either through improving the environment/infrastructure or through polic y interventions . The first step to developing a systemic approach for addressing health and wellness in LHTD w ould be the creation of a multidisciplinary and multisectoral committee encompassing government, industry, companies, advocacy groups and truck drivers. Together, a strategy could be developed ensuring the goals of all the partners are met (e.g. operations , policies, investment, and funding) while also addressing issues on a broader system level.

Introduction and Overview Long -haul truck drivers (LHTD) are employed to drive a truck, usually for a distance exceeding a 150-160 km radius from their home terminal (Bigelow et al. , 2014). Truck driving is the second most common occupation in Canada (following retail sales) employing nearly one in 35 males (Ontario Ministry of Transportation , 2006, Bigelow et al. , 2012, Angeles et al. , 2013). However, the number of women in the trucking sector is expected to grow in the coming years (Sicard , 2012, Apostolopoulos et al. , 2013, Marcom , 2017). Presently, t here are over 300,000 LHTD in Canada (Gill & MacDonald, 2013) . Alberta has approximately 46,000 LHTD, the third highest among Canadian provinces (Government of Alberta , 2016). Over the past decade, the shortage of LHTD has become more pronounced which might be due to aging and retirement , the lack of earning potential or due to health and wellness concerns. Already in 2020, there is an estimated shortage of 25,000 to 33,000 LHTD in Canada (Gill and Macdonald , 2013) and a shortage of 6,500 LHTD in Alberta ( Governmen t of Alberta, 2016). The monthly labour force survey shows the average age of LHTD in Canada is 48 years (Komarnicki 2012) with more than 47% of truck drivers being between the ages of 30 to 50 years, 4.5% between 18 and 30 years and 48.5% over 50 years (Canadian Common Health Survey, 2014 ). The aging workforce combined with poorer retention of skilled workers and recruitment of new drivers, has resulted in a shortage of LHTD (Gill & Macdonald , 2013). Other factors may also contribute to challenges in re cruiting and retaining LHTD including pay wages. The base pay for LHTD has not increased in almost 30 years and due to the hours of service regulations, earning potential is seen as a barrier to working in this industry (McDonough et al. , 2014). Many studi es have also cited health and wellness concerns which may also contribute to the LHTD shortage (Transport Canada , 2013 ; Hege et al. , 2019). Truck drivers are Classification: Public2 considered a vulnerable population due to the high rates of disease that are impacted by age, lifestyle factors and the environment (Crizzle et al. , 2017). 1.1 Health and Wellness LHTD work in stressful conditions that favor unhealthy lifestyles. For example, LHTD often work long shifts (13 -16 hours per day) , have interrupted sleep patterns and are fa tigued, have poor access to exercise equipment and nutritious meals, are sedentary, sit for prolonged periods of time, smoke, are socially isolated and are exposed to excessive noise and vibration, (Ng et al. , 2015 ; Hege et al. , 2016 ; Thiese et al. , 2018). As a result, LHTD often develop chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease (Bigelow et al. , 2014 ; Sieber et al. , 2014). LHTD studies in the USA also show that many have risk factors for chronic disease. For exam ple, 22-24% have hypertension (Sieber et al. , 2014 ; Thiese et al. , 2015), more than 50% are obese (Albert et al. , 2014 ; Ronna et al. , 2016), 6 -14% have diabetes (Thiese et al. , 2015) and 18-51% have sleep apnea (Olson et al. , 2016 ; Guglielmi et al. , 2018). Consequently, the average life expectancy is 12 -20 years lower than the general population (Saltzman & Belzer , 2007 ; Potter et al. , 2018) . While there have been several studies conducted on the health and wellness in the United States (Chen et al. , 2015 ; Thiese et al. , 2015, 2018 ; Lincoln et al. , 2018), there is little kn owledge about the health, prevalence of chronic diseases or risk factors for poor health , and access to health and wellness initiatives or programs in LHTD in Alberta, and m ore generally, in Canadian LHTD (Bigelow et al. , 2014 ; Crizzle et al. , 2017). The differences between the Canadian and U.S. work environments with regards to LHTD including heal th coverage, industry practices, hours of service regulations, diet and climate are significant enough to prevent the generalization of the U.S. results to the Canadian context. Classification: Public3 1.2 Environment LHTD often spend 2 -3 weeks per trip away from home and in the ir truck (McCartt et al. , 2008) . Truck stops are an important component for LHTD to refuel, eat, and sleep. Additionally, it also serves as a place to shower and potentially use the internet to connect with family and friends. While prior studies have attempted to change individual behaviours to improve the health and wellness of LHTD (Gillespie et al. , 2014), recent studies have supported the notion that environmental changes that address the work settings (e.g. truck stops/rest areas) need to be integrated into health and wellness approaches (Gillespie et al., 2014; Nelson et al. , 2015; Pronk , 2013). A report from Alberta shows that there are 521 roadside facilities with only 6 facilities having the all the requisite amenities wanted by LHTD (e.g. bathroom s, shower facilities and food vendors ) (Lazzarino , 2015) . In addition, due to work schedules and time demands, many LHTD cannot access healthy foods or exercise facilities (Jacobson et al. , 2007 ; Passey et al ., 2014) , further contributing to the development of disease . 1.3. Occupational Injuries Studies show that LHTD are at risk for occupational injures such as low back pain, falls and accidents as a result of fatigue (long shifts), lifting of heavy freight, and whole -body vibration (Sakkay et al. , 2018 ; Ramroop , 2012 ; Mehta et al. , 2019). For example, symptoms of sleep apnea and fatigue contribute to the increased risk of motor vehicle accidents (Angeles et al., 2013; Al-Otaibi, 2015 ; Hege et al. , 2016 ; Crizzle et al. , 2017). LHTD account for up to 20% of all crashes (Insurance Inst itute for Highway Safety , 2015) and recent studies have associated increased age and different chronic conditions such as, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea and musculoskeletal disorders with crash risk (Angeles et al., 2013 ; Hege et al. , 2016, Thiese et al. , 2017). Classification: Public4 1.4 Purpose and Objectives To date, there have been a limited number of research studies on LHTD in Canada. While there is info rmation on US drivers, this information cannot be extrapolated t o Canadian LHTD, in part due to different hours of service regulations, road and weather conditions, and access to truck stops. Data on Canadian LHTD is needed to determine the predominant health conditions inherent in this population, their risk factors, and contextual factors that influence health and wellness decisions. This data is needed for the development of novel interventions that address health issues in Canadian LHTD. Alberta is an ideal location as it serves as a major central route for drivers going from west to east, and vice versa, or from north to south and vice versa. However, there is no data on LHTD in Western Canada and to our best knowledge, there are little evidence evaluating truck stops in Alberta. The overall purpose of this project was to collect data on the health and wellness, lifestyle and working conditions of LHTD. To address this goal, the objectives of this study are to: 1) To describe the health, lifestyle practices, working conditions, quality of life and job satisfacti on of truck drivers 2) To identify correlates and predictors of poor health, accidents (motor vehicle collisions, falls), quality of life and worker compensation claims 3) To describe the truck stop environment, such as healthy food options, resources for physical activities, access to health information, cleanliness, etc. The following sections describes the methodology including the research protocol and ethics approval, sampling and recruitment, study design, and the measurement tools used. The Classification: Public5 third sec tion describes the results followed by a discussion of the findings within the broader literature including challenges and study limitations. Classification: Public6 2. Methods This section of the report describes the methodology including the research protocol , ethics approval, sampling and recruitment, data collection tools and analysis. 2.1 Research Protocol LHTD entering truck stops were approached for possible participation . The rationale for collecting data directly from truck stops are that response rates are higher when data is collected in person (Sieber et al. , 2014 ; Birdsey et al. , 2015). The research team set -up a station in all the truck stops visited from 4:30pm to 10 :30pm from Monday to Saturday. Data collection did not occur on Sundays as many LHTD do not work/drive. Posters advertising the study along with the specific dates the research team would be at the truck stop were posted on the advertisin g boards and entrances to the truck stops (see Appendix A ). All LHTD who expressed interest in participating in the study completed a screening form (see inclusion/exclusion criteria below) and if eligible , were asked to formerly participate in the study. The study consisted of three parts: a survey, objective health measurements, and an interview. Some completed 1 or 2 parts; however, some also completed all three parts of the study . There was no order to data collection. If multiple participants were recruited at the same time, one would begin with the survey while another participant would complete the objective health measurements . Participation in the interview occurred last, although i t could be conducted first in those who did not wish to complete the survey or participate in the objective health measurements. LHTD were given an honorarium of $20 for the survey, $20 for objective health assessments, and $10 for the interview. If partic ipants were not willing to participate, we attempted to document reasons for refusal. In most cases, participants did not provide a reason and left the truck stop almost immediately . Classification: Public7 2.2 Research Ethics Approval This study was approved by the Behavioural Research Ethics Board at the University of Saskatchewan (BEH ID 164). Prior to participation, LHTD read through the letter of information and had the opportunity to ask any questions. Participant s needed to provide consent for each study c omponent. Confidentiality was strictly maintained throughout all phases of the study. Each respondent was given a unique identifying number in the dataset. All electronic data files were stored on a password -protected computer to maintain anonymity and con fidentiality. The electronic files were further placed in a folder that required a username and password for login purposes that only the pri ncipal investigator (PI) and the immediate research team had access to. 2.3 Sampling and Recruitment To collect data on LHTD, the study employed two strategies. The first strategy was to select highway segments commonly driven by LHTD, stratified by geographic region and traffic volume based on the Alberta Transportation Traffic Volume Report (Alberta Transp ortation , 2016) and select ed individual truck stops along the highway routes. This ensured that truck drivers travelling along both high - and low -flow traffic routes were included in the study. The second step included identifying Alberta truck stops alon g high and low mileage routes. The rationale for collecting health data at truck stops was that LHTD are a mobile, difficult to reach population, and most importantly, no efficient sampling frame exist. Truck stops with a restaurant and paved overnight parking lot with at least five parking spaces were selected based on the Alberta listing of truck stops ( https://www.allstays.com/c/truck -stops - alberta.htm ). Based on these crite ria, the project team initially decided on 6 truck stops in Alberta (Hanna, Calgary, Medicine Hat , Edmonton, Red Deer and Lloydminster). However, after Classification: Public8 reviewing Hanna and visiting the truck stop in Medicine Hat, the project team determined these truck sto ps were too small (e.g. no parking spots) and had limited or no volume for recruitment. Additionally, we also learned of a high -volume truck stop in Edmonton that was not on the original list. Consequen tly, we decided to recruit participants from this truc k stop to ensure we recruited as many LHTD as possible. In total, the project team recruited LHTD from 5 truck stop locations including Lloydminster, Edmonton (two different truck stops), Red Deer and Calgary over the 6 -week data collection period. We also visited two truck stops in Saskatoon where we attempted to recruit more drivers over a one -week period. 2.3.1 Sample Size The sample size calculation was based on determining the prevalence of various health conditions and behaviours in LHTD. With an approximate 45,000 truck drivers in Alberta (Alberta Government , 2016), a confidence level of 95% with a margin of error of 5, the study required a sample of 381 participants. While the project team was prepared to over sample, data collection due to staff availability, occurred over 6 weeks instead of the original proposed 3 months (12 weeks) . In total, 2 38 LHTD participated in the survey and completed 1 component of the study (survey), 200 completed two components ( objective health assessments & survey) and 92 took part in the interview (all of whom also completed the survey) . On average, approximately 6.6 LHTD were recruited per day. One Post -Doc, one graduate student, and at least one faculty member oversaw all aspects of data collection over the 6-week data collection period . For consistency and standardization purposes, the Post -Doc and graduate research students administered the survey and the objective health measurements , while the faculty member performed all interviews. Classification: Public9 2.3.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Participants were approached by the research team upon entering the truck stop (i.e. convenience sampling). If interested and passing the screening criteria, all eligible LHTD were included in the study. For study inclusion, al l LHTD needed to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, as stated below. Inclusion Criteria 1) Must identify themselves as a LHTD 2) Drive a truck with three or more axles for at least 12 months 3) Took at least one mandatory 10 -hour rest period away from home during the trip or would be required to have a 10 -hour rest period Exclusion Criteria 1) Was a non -Canadian LHTD 2) A short -haul driver or a driver who returned home every night After meeting the eligibility criteria (Appendix B), LHTD were told of all study components and subsequently read and signed the consent form (Appendix C). 2.4 Data Collection Tools 2.4.1 Long -Haul Truck Driver Survey LHTD are identified as a segment of the commercial motor vehicle driver population who are at increased risk of poor health outcomes as a result of operational characteristics of their industry that make it exceedingly difficult to adopt and maintain healt hy behaviours. Consultations between the r esearch team and stakeholders emphasized the importance of surveying drivers regarding their health and what is required for them to take action to improve their health and wellness (Bigelow et al. , 2015). Classification: Public10 As sho wn in Appendix D, the survey was designed to capture factors that influence occupational health and injuries in LHTD. The survey was used in prior US studies to collect information on LHTD demographics, risk factors and prevalence rates of medical conditio ns (Sieber et al. , 2014, Birdsey et al. , 2015). This survey was used in the present study and adapted to a Canadian context. Additionally, new questions were added. Survey questions covered several domains including truck driver demographics, truck dri ver information (e.g. type of LHTD, km driven per year), work history, health behaviours (e.g. smoking, diet, exercise, sleep), truck crashes and work -related injuries, job -related training, company safety climate/culture (e.g. dispatching, scheduling, incent ives) and other safety related questions (e.g. seat belt use, speeding). Participants were also asked about current health conditions for which LHTD might be at increased risk, including musculoskeletal disorders, heart disease, hypertension, hypercholest erolemia, stroke, diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, sleep disorders, and cancer. Questions on overall health (e.g., self -perceived health and mental health), smoking, and alcohol consumption were based on questions from the Canadian Community Health Su rvey as they had been used in prior Ontario LHTD driving studies (Angeles et al. , 2014 , Bigelow et al. , 2012). Additionally, as fatigue is a major issue in LHTD , the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Johns , 1991) was included in the survey along with questions concerning alertness (e.g., caffeine, energy drinks, smoking, and chewing gum). Drivers w ere also asked about their driving performance (hard breaking, traffic citations, crashes) and if fatigue played a significant role. 2.4.2 Objective Health Assessments The second component collected objective health measurements to estimate the prevalence of risk factors and health conditions. The data collection sheet can be seen in Classification: Public11 Appendix E. After consenting to participate in this stud y component, LHTD had their bloo d pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, and fat content assessed. 2.4.2.1 Blood Pressure Diastolic and systolic b lood pressure was measured using the Bios Diagnostic Machine. Participants were classified as: normal blood pressure (systolic < 120 mmHg) and Stage 2 hypertension (systolic 140 or diastolic 90 mmHg) (American Heart ). 2.4.2. 2 Anthropometric measures Multiple anthropometric measurements were taken to capture body mass index. Data was collected on height (using a stadiometer) and weight (using a balance scale), waist and abdomen circumference, arm sp an, elbow, wri st and neck circumference , and elbow breadth (using a measuring tape) . Knee height was used as a proxy for height if a participant was particularly large (e.g. weighed more than the scale itself). Body Mass Index ( BMI ) was calculated using th e formula of weight (kg) / [height (m)]2 (National Center for Health Statistics , 2013). BMI is categorized as <18.5 grade III (morbid obese) (WHO, 2019). Stature , an alternative measure for height , was also calculated (Berger et al. , 2008) . Stature and frame size are both indicator s of body composition and total body fat (Chumela et al., 2002) and were calculated using the following formula: Stature (men) = (2.02 \u00d7 knee height) - (0.04 \u00d7 age) + 64.19 Stature (women) = (1.83 \u00d7 knee height) - (0.24 \u00d7 age) + 84.88 [Berger et al. , 2008] Frame Index 2 = elbow breadth / stature \u00d7 100 Classification: Public12 The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) classification, adapted from Frisancho (1990 ), was used to categorize individuals based on frame size into small, medium and large sizes . 2.4.2. 3 Body Composition measures Body composition refers to the distribution and size of body weight which includes both fat mass and fat -free mass. Different skinfolds including triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and biceps were measured to calculate body density, fat mass, percent body fat and fat free mass. In addition to the standardized equations for calculating body fat and BMI ( above ), we also used three different objective measures: t he Omron Monitor, the Taylor Body Fat Analyzer and Scale and an Omron Body Fat Analyzer to specify the most precise and reliable device can be used for determining BMI in future practice (Figure 1 ). Figure 1 . Body composition scales : Taylor (Left), Omron Body Fat Analyzer (Middle) , Omron Monitor (Right) . To calculate total body fat (fat mass), b ody density (D) was computed using age - and sex - adjusted equations (Janz et al. , 1993). Fat mass, percent body fat and fat free mass were calculated u sing the following formulas: Fat Mass or Total Body Fat (TBF) = body weight (kg) \u00d7 [(4.95/D) - 4.5] Percent Body Fat = fat mass (kg) / body weight (kg) \u00d7 100% Fat Free Mass (FFM) = body weight (kg) - total body fat (kg) [Siri 1961] Classification: Public13 2.4.2. 4 Strength Assessment Hand grip strength (right and left hands) was m easured using the Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer . Lower grip strength has been associated with an increased risk of premature mortality ( Celis -Morales et al. , 2018). Participants were instructed to sit down on a chair in a neutral position with their elbow flexed at 90 degrees. Participants then squeezed the dynamometer with the reading recorded by the researchers. The average of two trials for both the right and left hands were calcul ated. 2.4.2.5 Diet and lifestyle measures To better understand the diet and exercise habits of LHTD, we collected information on the types of food (e.g. fruit and vegetables, processed meals) and drinks (e.g. coffee, water, energy drinks) consumed, as well as self-reported physical activity (categorized as sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, and extre mely active) (Tremblay , 2017) . LHTD were also asked if they prepare d homemade foods (and shop at grocery stores), whether they had a fridge, microwave, hot plate or slow cooker, how much they eat at restaurants whi le working (e.g. fast food) and if they we re buying prepared or non -prepared foods at truck stops/grocery stores /restaurants. 2.4.2.6 Interview The third component consisted of semi -structured interviews with LHTD to gain a more in-depth understanding of work and environmental factors not captured in the survey. The semi - structured interviews were performed on a one -to-one basis between a faculty member and the participant. Drivers were asked about their health and wellness, diet, exercise, sleep, electronic log-book use, rest stops/truck stops, impact of marijuan a legislation, and provisions of company programs to support a healthy lifestyle. Open -ended questions regarding suggestions for Classification: Public14 solutions to improve the health of drivers and to improve drivers' job satisfaction were included (see Appendix F for Interview Script) . 2.5 Analysis Plan Survey and objective health measurements were analyzed using SPSS Version 26 (SPSS IBM, New York, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics (i.e., frequencies (%) for categorical variables, mean and standard deviation for continuous variables) were calculated for all variables (e.g., demographics, risk factors, occupational injuries and medical conditions) . Histograms and bar charts were used to show the distributions of the variables . Additionally, associations between variables of interest were con ducted using either chi -square tests, independent t -tests or correlations. Analyses was considered significant if p-values 0.05. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Additionally, notes were taken during the interview session. Af ter transcription was completed, the transcripts and notes for each session were independently analyzed by the Post -Docto ral Fellow and a graduate research assistant and analyzed using NVivo . Codes were ascribed to sentences or paragraphs (open coding) of the text in response to the interview questions (Hsieh & Shannon , 2005 ; Golafshani , 2003). The process began with line -by-line coding using an open coding process to determine key themes . The initial codes were independently produced by both the Post-Doctoral Fellow and the graduate research assistant using thematic analysis and then compared t o examine areas of agreement and confirm possible themes (priority areas or strong views that emerged throughout the interviews) (Hsieh & Shannon , 2005). A third member (the PI) served as an auditor to verify the process by which themes were identified. This rigorous triangulation process ensured the integrity of the findings and enhance trustworthiness of qualitative data (Golafshani , 2003). Classification: Public15 Section 3. Resu lts 3.1 Participant Characteristics The survey was completed by 238 participants. The mean age of LHTD was 50.6\u00b112.4 years (range 23 to 89); 96.5% were men. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the sample by age. More than a third of the LHTD were between the ages of 51 -60 years. Almost 40% of the participants recruited lived in A lberta, followed by Saskatchewan (17.2%) , Manitoba (14.7%), Ontario British Col umbia (10.8%) . The remainder (5%) reported living in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Figure 2. Truck driver's age More than 86% of the LHTD identified themselves as Caucasian, followed by American Indian (4.6%) and Asian (3.6%). As shown in Table 1, more than 73% had no children, with 12.2% having one child and 7.8% having two children.

Eighty two percent of trucking companies hired LHTD as independent -owner operators to carry/ship goods; 12.7% of companies hired LHTD but used their own trucks and 5.3% had other ways of hiring such as Hi Boy work, specialized heavy haul or subcontract driver for owner -operator . Using the Government of Canada's (2018) criteria for categorizing companies within the transportation industry, 64% worked for very sma ll or small companies (Table 2). Almost 10% of the sample worked for large companies, defined as having more than 500 employees. A few respondents (4.1%) could not approximate the number of company employees. Almost 95% of the sample were not part of a lab our union. Table 2.

Other types of cargo that were reported by the LHTD included trash, used household/offi ce goods, pipe, heavy equipment, groceries, general freight, food product, farm equipment, cement. Of those with cargo, 70.6% of the sample were carrying more than 10,000 pounds of product. Except for two drivers, all were pulling a trailer which were flatbed (23.2%), followed by a refrigerated van (21.1%), tanker (8.8%), low boy (6.6%) and enclosed van (6.5%). Drivers also mentioned driving trailers such as B train (1.2%) , step deck (2.5%) and super B (4%) . Most drivers had one pickup (65.3%) or drop (63.1%) in their current trip, with 6.54\u00b121.5 (range 0 to 12) pickups and 3.55 \u00b112.1 (range 0 to 24) drops. The average number of kilometers driven in the past 12 months by LHTD w as 170,890 \u00b1 102,755 km (range 3,500 to 999,998 km). More than 50% o f the sample drove more than 175,000 km in the last 12 months. LHTD reported working 57.0 \u00b1 27.1 hours (3 to143) in the past 7 days; 20% reported working between 70 to 100 hours and 4% more than 100 hours in the past 7 days. One participant reported working 143 hours (20.4 hours/day over the past 7 days). The sample also reported driving at night (n=144) on average 26.9 \u00b1 23.7 hours (1 to 100) over the past 7 days. The sample reported driving on average 8.7 \u00b1 18.8 hours ( 0 to 20.5) continuous ly without taking a break. Approximately 96% of the sample reported keeping the temperature in the truck comfortable during their 10 -hour rest period. To maintain a comfortable temperature, 31.7% kept their engine on (idling), followed by 31.2% using the truck auxiliary power unit , 33.3% used a portable heater or opened windows if too hot and 1.6% hooked up to the truck stop's power . Classification: Public18 3.2.1 Work History Our sample, on average, have worked as a LHTD for 22.8 \u00b1 15.7 years ( 0.5 to 56 ). More than half of the sample (54%) mentioned that they sleep at home for their mandatory rest periods. These respondents reported working for 13.3 \u00b1 13.4 years. Prior to being a LHTD, 41.1% of the sample reported being employed in the trucking industry , as a mechanic, dock worker, dispatcher or supervisor, on average for 6.6 \u00b1 6.5 years. As shown in Table 3, 5% of the sample had a second job and reportedly spent 26.7 \u00b1 28.5 hours working per week. Table 3. Years and number of hours per week worked in other jobs .

Work Environment About 60.8% of the sample reported being required to load and unload their truck; 18% said they only need to do this sometimes. Almost all the drivers (95.2%) used protective devices (e.g. safety glasses, work gloves, boots, hard hats, safety vests) and a few used a face mask (12.8%), a respirator (9.2%), a hearing protector (28.6%) and chemical barrier gloves (22.4%). About 45% of participants stated that when they were given an unrealistic delivery time, they refused the load or renegotiated the time whilst 24% of them reported taking the load. When asked about their driving experience and challenging situations over the past 12 months, 95.4% of drivers stated that they must deliver or pick up a load at a given time, 65.9% reported receiving an unrealistically tight delivery schedule, 61% stated that the time they were allotted Classification: Public19 for loading and unloading was unrealistically tight, 72.6% mentioned that their delivery was later than scheduled, 86.8% acknowledged that traffic congestion delayed their deliveries significantly, 45.3% reported violati ng the Hours -of-Service r egulations , 81.7% stated that they arrived on time but were forced to wait to e nter a dock although 91% agreed upon that the dispatcher worked with them get them home as scheduled. While driving their truck at work, over 71% of drivers reported to get frustrated by operation at the loading dock, more than 90% got frustrated by other drivers on the road and 15.5% reported never using a seat belt while driving. 3.3 Job-Related Training LHTD were asked if they received enough training at the beginning of their career. Over half (56%) reported to have receive enough training although 33% said they did not and 10% did not receive any training whatsoever. Just over half of the sample had received private training (52.6%) while 12.1% received training from a family member, 8.9% from a trucking company 6.3% from a public or technical school a nd 2.6% were trained in the military. Just over 17% of the sample had never received any training. Almost all participants (93%), however, stated they felt as if they now have enough experience to drive safely and secure their cargo. Participants were also asked what type of training they received. Approximately 60% received information on federal regulations (e.g. hours of service), safe driving practices and behaviours (60.5%), proper lifting techniques (55%), fall prevention (51%), vehicle maintenance and safety checks (69%), security procedures (64.7%) and assault prevention (25%). Classification: Public20 3.4 Company Safety Climate/Culture About 44% of respondents of the 128 company drivers reported that their company provide d safety awards. Respondents noted that 79% of companies have safety programs, policies, rule s or guidelines regarding workplace safety. About 60% of the sample reported logging their hours electronically to document their hours of service. LHTD were asked about their company's safety strategy. Approximately 96% agreed that company management fel t that worker safety was a priority and 95% reported that employees and management work together to ensure a safe working environment. However, about 94% agreed that company management take shortcuts when addressing worker safety. 94% of the sample report ed driving alone, 2.5% with a non -driving passenger (e.g. significant other), 1.5% drove in pairs/triplets as part of a team, and 1% was a novice driver driving with a trainer and 1% was a trainer driving with a novice driver. 3.5 Compensation LHTD who were company drivers had an average net annual income , before taxes, of $91,855 \u00b1 66,977 (range 3 0k to 450k ). Those who were owner operator s (n=111) had an average net annual income , before taxes , of $82,569 \u00b1 55,795 (range of 0.3k to 250k.

Fifty seven percent of the sample reported being paid for non -driving work such as dropping and hooking trailers, waiting at the dock or loadin g/ unloading. Almost 16% of the sample reported that companies offered bonuses or penalties based on whether the deliveries arrive on time or not. Figure 3. Employee earnings The average amount of time spent at the truck stop , over the last 7 days, after they had finished driving for the day was 7.9 \u00b1 18. 9 hours (0 to 70 hours ). The sample also reported non - paid work that average d between 4 and 5 hours due to waiting for dispatch, completing paper electronic logs, or other tasks at the terminal (e.g. chaining tires, fueling, inspection, loading/unloading and tank wash). The number of hours spent at the truck stop and performing other activities are shown in Table 5. 13.2 52.514.220.2 By the hour By the mile By the load A % of revenues Classification: Public22 Table 5.

Of those who did receive benefits, 62.4% had health insurance from their employer or union and 54.9% receive d paid vacation time , respectively . Only 16.7% reported receiving a pension following retirement from their employer or union and 19.3% reported having a private pension plan through contribut ions from their company. About 68% of LHTD were covered by private health insurance, including coverage from their spouse or partner. Truck drivers did not participate in their employer or union health insurance plan because there was no plan (49.3%), was too expensive (13.3%), was not eligible (12%) or there were other reasons (16%) including long wait time s, spouse having a better plan or being self -employed. 3.7 Employer Health and Wellness Programs LHTD were asked whether their employer provided any programs to support safety, health and wellness. Just over a fifth (22%) reported having access to the Workers Health Classification: Public23 Promotion (WHP) program . Among those drivers who belonged to a trucking company, 30% had access to health promotion programs. Approximately 17% of the sample reported being aware of the Certificate of Recognition (COR program), 16.4% of the North American Fatigue Management Program (NAFMP), 10.5% of the Healthy Fleet Challenge (NAL insuran ce) and 7.6% were aware of health and wellness programs in their own company. Of the respondents, only 7.1% were aware of two of the programs , 3.8% of three of the programs, and 2.1% were aware of all four above mentioned programs. Almost 70% were not awar e of any programs. Only a few respondents reported taking any programs. For instance, 7.1% completed the COR program, 10.1% the NAFMP, and 6.4% the NAL. Only 4.2% completed the program offered by their company. Approximately 84% of the sample did not compl ete any health -related program. 3.8 Health and Wellness This section explains LHTDs' health status , anthropometric measurements, obesity, physical activity, diet, smoking and alcohol habits, c affeine intake, the prevalence of chronic diseases including fatigue, and quality of life. 3.8.1 Health Status Participants were asked to rate their own health. A pproximately 72% reported being in good health while 28% rated their health as fair or poor (see Table 6). Table 6.

According to the definition provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) , a WC greater than 102 for men and 88 cm for women is associated with increased risk Classification: Public26 for chronic disease such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (WHO, 2000). Using the WHO guidelines, 64.1% of the sample would be classified as having an increased risk for chronic disease. Taking into consideration both BMI and WC, any driver with a WC less than 102 cm for men or 88 for women and a normal BMI has the least risk of chronic disease ; an increased risk if overweight and having a high risk of being obese. For drivers with a WC greater than 102 for men or 88 for women and a normal BIM are considered to have an increased risk; are high risk if they are overweight and very high risk if they are obese ( National Institute of He alth, 1998). The risk profiles for the sample was summarized in Table 1 0. Almost 90% of the sample were at an increased risk with more than 50% considered to be high -risk. Table 1 0.

Additionally, 20% reported taking multivitamins/minerals (e.g. calcium, magnesium, vitamin D and B12) while 12% took other supplements (e.g. fish oil, Psyllium and garlic supplements ). The average calorie intake for truck drivers was 2776.4 520.9 kcal/day (range 1 663 to 4237 kcal/day ). Comparatively, the average calorie intake in the general C anadian adult population is 1978 kcal/day for those aged betw een 19 to 50 years old and 1762 kcal/day for those older than 50 years of age (CCHS 2017). As shown in Table 12, Approximately 35% of LHTD bought prepared foods (e.g. hot dogs, sandwiches) at a truck at least once per day; 78% purchased prepared foods at least once per week. About 39% bought prepared foods at grocery stores. Additionally, about 20.3% reported eating at a restaurant (e.g. McDonalds, Wendy's, Pizza Hut) at least once per day ; 74% stopping at least once per week. Almost 39% of the sample rarely or never bought non -prepared foods at grocery stores to prepare foods for their trips. Overall, 41.5% of truck drivers reported not eating healthy while on the road. Some LH TD reported having a fridge, microwave, hot plate and slow cooker in the truck cabin; 76% had a fridge, 44% had a microwave. More than 46% reported having both a fridge Classification: Public28 and microwave while 19% reported not having either. Very few reported having a hot plate or slow cooker. Table 12.

One participant reported smoking ar ound 60 cigarettes per day. Only 13% of smokers reported not smoking at least 30 cigarettes per day. The average age LHTD reported beginning to smoke regularly was 25.6 \u00b1 27 years ( 10 to 50). We also asked respondents about marijuana use. Almost a tenth ( 9.3%) reported using marijuana , ranging from 1 to 6 times per day. Following legalization, 6.6% of the sample reported smoking more than before legalization. 3.8.7 Alcohol consumption Thirty four percent of the sample reported drinking alcohol in the past 12 months. Of those that responded yes to drinking alco hol, only 2.7% drank daily, 8.9% a few times per week, and 15.2% at least once per week.

Three drivers also reported having congestive heart disease. Almost 3% of the sample reported having emphysema and 4.4% had obstructive lung disea se. 3.8.11 Cancer Approximately 13% of LH TD report ed a diagnosis of cancer. The most prevalent type of cancer was prostate cancer ( 4.6%), followed by colon cancer cancer (0.7%) . LHTD were primarily diagnosed with cancer after the age of 50; there was one breast cancer diagnosis at 35 (in a man who weighed 154kg) , melanoma at 45 a nd two colon cancer diagnoses at age 30 and 35, respectively. 3.8.12 Fatigue In the past 7 days, more than 14% of the sample reported being fatigued for the entire day while 20% felt fatigued for only parts of the working day. A large proportion of LHTD ( 71%) stated that fatigue interfered with different aspects of their life; general level of daily activity Classification: Public32 (14.3%), leisure activities (16.1%), ability to concentrate (12%), relationships (18%), and general life enjoyment (28.5%). More than 18% of the sample (18.4%) highly agreed that loading and unloading the truck is difficult due to being too tired and 34% said they felt physically exhausted after loading and unloading. Approximately 19% reported needing extra breaks during the workd ay due to fatigue. The average number of hours the sample drove without taking a break (e.g. stopping for any reason) during a delivery was 6.1 \u00b1 10.8 hours ( 0.5 to 35). However, over half of the sample did take a break after 4 hours of continuous driving (61.3%) while 7% drove more than 8 hours before taking a break. 3.8.13 Sleep Disorders The average number of hours the sample slept in a 24 -hour period was 8.8 \u00b1 11.7 hours (range 2 to 15). Over half of the sample (50.6%) reported having broken sleep. About 11% of LHTD reported not being able to sleep once at home during the past 30 days with 64.3% spending less than 10 days at home. The average number of days the sample slept at home was 8.7 \u00b1 15.3 days in the last 30 days. Sleep apnea was reported in 18.3% of the sample, however, only 8% reported using a Continuous Positive Air Pressure (CPAP) machine while sleeping. Forty seven percent of drivers were told they snore loudly while sleeping or trying to sleep with 20% of them snowing frequently (5-7 times per week ). Moreover, 15.2% of LHTD reported snorting or gasping while sleeping with 6.2% complaining about this every day. Approximately 10% of the sample mentioned that their breathing had stopped or had difficulty breathing when sleeping. LHTD completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), a measure of sleep propensity (Johns, 1991). As show n in Figure 6, ESS scores were normal in 78.5% of the sample while Classification: Public33 21.5% had at least a minimum risk of dozing during the day. Approximately 12.2% reported driving while drowsy every day; 15% reported doing this at least once in the past 3 months. More tha n a quarter of the sample (27.6%) reporting falling asleep while driving . Only two LHTD reported taking medications to stay awake when driving such as stimulant use. Figure 6. ESS scores 3.8.14 Depression Approximately 40% of the sample reported being depressed . About 20% of the sample received professional treatment and another 15% had taken anti-depressants in the past 12 months. More than 67% of LHTD thought that depression can come and go daily or last for weeks/months. More than a th ird (36.5%) thought that depression and stress were the same thing although 69% thought that stress is the major cause of depression. More than 20% believed people with depression never fully recover. 01020304050607080 Normal (8-18) Mild During the past 12 months, 10.4% reported being injured while working and were required to visit a doctor or other health professional. From those who injured , 68% reported being injured at least once while 32% were injured multi ple times. A sprain or strain was the primary injury for 46.6% of the sample followed by suffering a fracture (14%). The most common body part injured was the back (41%), followed by hands/wrist/arm (32%), legs (24.6%) and feet (21.4%). More than a third (36%) of LHTD reported to have persistent low back pain during the past 3 months (36%). Compared to those without low back pain, those with l ow back pain were significantly more likely to smoke (68% vs 86.2%, p=0.008), be depressed (29.7% vs 58%, not have health benefits (76.6% vs 58%, p=0.016) or have access to company health promotion programs (25.9% vs 12.7%, p=0.040). Almost a fifth (17%) had multiple i njuries. The most common reasons for being injured were related to contact with an object or equipment (29%) and falls (27%). Compared to non - fallers, fallers were significantly less likely to have received prior training in fall prevention (26.7% vs. 65.6 %, p=0.013) . Other reasons for sustaining injuries were related to poor sitting posture, continuous repetitive motion, seat vibration, lifting tarps, heavy boxes or equipment, awkward movements, shoveling cattle out of a trailer, stepping into a fuel hole , a tire explosion, and tripping on a hay bale. Almost a third of these injuries (31%) occurred while loading/unloading, followed by getting in/out of the truck cabin (8%), getting on/off the freight carrying portion of the truck (7.5%) and securing loads (7.3%) . The most common location s for these injuries are shown in Table 15. \"Other\" locations include a drilling rig, at a truck stop, on ice roads, at home, in a parking lot, truck yard and in the sleeper.

Reasons for disliking the industry include the high ris k for crashes (56.1%), poor truck maintenance (13.8%), long work hours (7.7%), lack of exercise (4.6%), unpredictable work hours (4.4%), being away from home (2.6%), non-crash related injuries (2%) and irregular work hours (2%). Truck drivers also had conc erns about animals on road, lack of mandatory drug test ing, weather condition s, lack of respect from other drivers/general population , low income, government interference, lack of healthy foods, workplace violence and driving at night . Almost three quarter s of the sample (72%) also said that they miss key family activities (e.g. birthdays) due to being away from home. 3.9 Environmental Issues This section explain s the availability of truck stops and rest areas in Alberta, as well as describes traffic violations and motor vehicle crashes in LHTD. 3.9.1 Parking In the past 12 months, 87% of drivers reported they had difficulty finding parking. As shown in Figure 7, 21% reported having problems finding parking more than 50 times in the Classification: Public36 past 12 months . More than three quarters (76.5%) reported that there was a severe parking shortage and 12.3% a significant shortage. Most of the sample (88%) report ed being familiar with the truck stops along the highway routes in Alberta (e.g. TransCanada Highway, Highway 2 or Yellowhead Highway), however, 87.2% had difficulty finding parking along the highway routes or in the bigger cities in the past 12 months. Appr oximately 43% of drivers reported losing 1 -2 hours of productive driving each time they had difficulty finding parking, followed 9% who reported losing 3 -4 hours and 5.5% losing over 5 hours. Figure 7. Number of times truck drivers had difficulty finding parking 3.9.2 Truck stop facilities Truck stops facilities and amenities were captured using photographs. Prior to taking photographs, approval was provided by the managers of the truck stops. Restaurant areas in the truck stops were generally open from the morning till 11pm at night and consisted of a seating area with a few televisions (see Figure 8a). While all truck stops had washrooms (see Figure 8b), only a few had shower facilities. Only one of the rest stops visited had computers that drivers could use to access the internet. Otherwise, truck st ops had free wifi for drivers provided they were inside the truck stop. There was no wifi connection in the parking area of the truck 051015202530 never 1-5 times 6-10 times 11-25 times 26-50 times >50 times12.926.9 12.9 8.821.1% population # difficulty find parking Classification: Public37 stop. As shown in Figures 8c to 8i, truck stops had limited access to healthy foods. Healthy foods that were available wer e costly. For example, the cost for one orange was $2 dollars and for an apple $1,60. Most foods that were available were processed and consisted of sandwiches, sausages or hot dogs, and pizza for sale. There were also purchase specials for chips and choco late bars (e.g. two for $2,50). There was also ample access to soft drinks, coffee and energy drinks. The price of soft drinks was the same irrespective of size, meaning the cost of a small and large cup of pop was the same. Figure 8. Truck stops amenities a b c d e f g h i Classification: Public38 3.9.3 Traffic violations and crashes In the past 12 months, only 13% reported a moving violation when working . About 6% of the sample reported receiving one traffic violation, 4% had two violations, and 3% did not provide a response. A third of the sample (33%) were involved in a recordable truck crash, either as a driver or a non -driving team member; 27% were an at -fault collision. Among those who reported being in a crash, half were involved in one crash, 28.1% in two crashes, 11% in three crashes, and 9.5% were involved in 4 or more crashes. Of the 64 reported crashes, 52% occurred prior to the year 2000 while 48% occurred between the years 2 000 and 2018; 33% occurred in the last 10 years (2008 -2018). As shown in Table 16 , compared to those who did not crash, LHTD who crashed were significantly older, had worked for more years, had poorer left hand grip strength , drank less coffee (5.7% vs 17%), had diabetes and high blood cholesterol spent less hours at the truck stops, spent less h ours resting, spent less days at home. Additionally, drivers that crashes had less company incentives compared to those who did not crash. More than a third of the sample (35%) reported having a near miss that made them lucky to have not been involved in a crash in the past 7 days. Approximately 24% reported having one near miss, 23% two near misses, and more than 50% reported having 3 or more near misses in the past week. Classification: Public39 Table 1 6.

Reasons mentioned for not visiting a physician's office was being afraid or disliking doctors, wanting to deal with the issue individually, and not having benefits, 3.10.1 Flu Shot Only 18.6% of truck drivers reported getting a flu shot in the past 12 months. Reasons for not getting a flu shot are shown in Table 17. Of note, more than 60% were unsure whether they needed a flu shot. Other reasons provided were believing the flu shot was not effective, fear of needles, concern of contaminated needles, and concerns over catching the flu from the shot. Table 17.

More than a quarter of those who were involved in a crash (26.6%) suffered injuries that required medical attention by a physician or other health care professional. Thirty five percent received medical treatment on -site while 30% were treated in the hospital and 10% at their physician's office. As a result, 83 .3% missed work and 20% filed a worker's compensation Classification: Public42 claim. However, only 75 % of those who summited a claim received payment for lost workdays while 37.5% received disability payments. The average number of missed workdays due to an injury or injuries were 41.4 \u00b1 104 ( 2 to 465 days). Almost 60% of work -related injuries were repor ted to the LHTD's employer. Among those injured, 54% required medical attention: 16% were treated in the hospital, 14% at the physician's office, 12% required on -site medical attention and 12% were treated in company clinics or other places. About 12% were hospitalized and 39% missed work due to suffering an injury. The average number of days of missed work was 52.4 \u00b1 65.5 days ( 1 to 200). More than 32% filed a worker's compensation claim with 25% being approved; 19% received disability payments. Reasons li sted for not receiving compensation for missed work due to an injury were related to the company policy, broker refusal, concerns of being fired, no time, believing the injury was too minor or not believing the injury warranted a claim. 3.12 Improving Saf ety Truck drivers' opinion were solicited on how safety can be improved. Over 95% of truck drivers reported that building more truck stops/rest areas was needed. Additionally, 75.2% suggested being paid by the hour rather than by the mile with 91.2% wanting to be paid by the hour for loading and unloading activities, 86.2% reported enforcing the same traffic laws to truckers and cars equally, 81.2% wanted a maximum speed limit for both trucks and cars on highways (38.5% suggested highway speed limits be increas ed by 10 miles per hour; 27.1% wanted a decrease in speed limits by 10 miles per hour), 58% wanted strict enforcement of the hours of service regulations, 57.4% suggested building designated truck lanes on highways, 52.3% agreed that a short rest break aft er 4 hours of continuous driving would help reduce fatigue, and 26.2% suggested trucks have speed limiters. Classification: Public43 3.13 Interview results LHTD were asked about a range of topics including how the nature of the job impacts their diet, fatigue , use of electronic logbooks , parking/rest areas, and marijuana use. A summary of each question is provided below. What are issues that impact your diet? Almost all participants stated that is was challenging to access healthy foods when on the road. While many drivers would eat at the truck stop restaurant, many would eat processed or less healthy foods simply due to cost. Many would eat noodles, hot dogs, pizza slices because they were already heated in the restaurant and because they were cheap. I like Mr. Noodles thing but they're way too much. It's cheap though, about 80 cents or so. That's not bad, them or like I get the little Uncle Ben's rice things, boil them for 90 seconds, cereal in the truck if I can some milk and that. Milk's too expensive though . - Participant 78 Some LHTD mentioned having a heat plate to cook foods in the truck. However, LHTD also said that they weren't able to cook their own meals because ingredients/groceries were not readily available on the road or in the truck stop. Many also said they did not have time or were too fatigued to cook during or at the end of their shift. Conversely, many would eat fast food, if not at the restaurant, then at other places within walking distance of the truck stop such as Wendy's or McDonalds, simp ly due to convenience or cost. It's not very good. Well I don't have the stuff in my truck to do anything I like. I have a cooler to keep things cold but I don't have anything to cook it with. So I eat a lot of processed foods. It's not healthy. - Partic ipant 92 Classification: Public44 There are some days I don't know two hours in advance before I have to go somewhere so it's hard to plan around that to get my food going and everything going. - Participant 29 I eat too much fast food. And I don't get enough exercise . - Participant 68 Are you able to exercise frequently? All LHTDs agreed that it is hard to exercise regularly when on the road . Some of them stated that their only chance for exercise is to job around the truck. However, some also noted that parking lots a re not well lit at night and that exercise outdoors is not possible during the winter months due to snow or from the parking lot not being well lit. Other drivers mentioned that their daily exercise was related to loading or unloading their trucks. That' s a good question, because you are limited. You can walk or jog around the parking lot or something, but what else can you do really? You know, you can't keep and do weights in in your truck really because then you are adding to the weight of the truck - Participant 2 They mostly agreed that the lack of physical activity impacts their energy level, as well as their risk of muscle strains. Given the lack of opportunity to exercis e, many drivers did not have any motivation to exercise despite knowing the benefits of exercise. Some drivers suggested that exercise facilities are needed at truck stops, with some saying they would pay a fee to access the equipment. My health, I think I'm okay right now, but if I keep driving long haul, my health's gonna be crap. Because I don't give a time to my gym, I don't give a time for a walk, because a certain period of time, I have to sleep, I have to wait and I have to drive. If I don't sleep, I don't get enough energy to drive and then I start feeling sleepy on the road, so I try as Classification: Public45 much as I can sleep, but the other thing, when we go home, even if we are on truck stops, the government or the truck stops, they should have, even they're paid, th ey should have small exercise machines at the truck stops. - Participant 43 Are there issues with fatigue in the trucking industry? Fatigue was mentioned by all LHTD's as a concern. Some drivers mentioned that given the low wages in the industry, in addition to being paid by the mile, has created substantive competition to drive more to earn more income, despite often being tired. There's too much competition, and the wages are too low. So you get what you pay for. So if you pay really low wages, you get low -skilled drivers. If you get low -skilled drivers, and you want to have you r productivity and you want to make your revenue, you have to push them hard. - Participant 12 Some other LHTD stated that Hours of Service (HOS) regulation forces them to continue to drive to earn income despite being tired and wanting to rest. Pressures to deliver goods on schedule was also mentioned as to why drivers continue to drive. However, some drivers said safety is their concern and would stop driving even if that would mean not meeting their scheduled delivery time. Other drivers also mentioned always staying within their HOS, however, some said they drive beyond their HOS to earn more income (drive more miles), particularly those who still use paper log -books. Sure, you're forced to drive and get what you can out of that date even though you are tired and you should be pulling over to grab a couple hours. Totally against the hours of regulation. I think that's up to the person that's behind the wheel of th at truck because he's the one that knows when he's tired better than anybody else . - Participant 45 Classification: Public46 For me, safety is number one. I was supposed to be offloading, I came in with Rainbow Lake. Rainbow Lake is maybe 130 klicks away from High Level. I made a lot of stops. I have to be active, otherwise I'm gonna sleep behind the wheel. I was tired, I wasn't sleepy. I'm supposed to be offloading at 5:00, I didn't show up 'til 10:00. They asked me, I said, \"Y'know what? Yes, but at least I showed up in once piec e than never.\" - Participant 58 What are your thoughts on electronic logbooks? Many LHTD stated that electronic logbooks do not impact their job satisfaction. Some said it's easier to enter their hours and were content, particularly those who were paid better or were more senior drivers. Some LHTD, however, were not happy with the el ectronic log -books as the paper logs would be easier to manipulate in order to drive more miles (earn a higher salary if being paid by the mile). Instead, they suggested the HOS should have specific exemptions and would like to be consulted on how best to do so. More leeway for exemptions. More exemptions. I'd say as a general rule, it's okay to say, okay, this how many hours you suggested to drive a day, but if you feel that you can go more and you're not tired, and you need a little bit more time to fin d a parking spot, get an exemption easily . - Participant 1 And rather than somebody sitting in an office in Ottawa, or wherever, coming up with a set of rules, they need to sit in my seat and say, \"how can we make it work?\" It can be made to work. We have to be able to do that, but we need input. We need to be able to put some input into it, and to convince the people who are making the rules to look at our side of it. - Participant 9 Classification: Public47 Are there any concerns with access to truck stops or rest stops? Almost all of the participants (91%) stated that there are not enough truck stops and/or rest areas in Canada. Participants reported the inability to find parking along highways/driving routes to be quite stressful. Parking was the primary concern in relat ion to insufficient truck stops and rest areas. Almost all participants (96%) stated that there is not enough parking, even when there are truck stops or rest areas. Even those rest stops on, or turn offs, really there isn't enough of them compared to th e amount of trucks on the road. - Participant 16 Every truck stop should have triple the parking that it has. - Participant 7 Many drivers reported often being forced to drive to the next location in hopes there are spots to park. In some cases, particip ants reported to continue driving despite being fatigued. This is especially a concern for those that start driving in the morning and finish their shift at night. If you're tried and you're looking to pull -in and oh, it's all full, now you've got to make the decision: do I keep pushing it or do I do 'til the next one? And if you don't know when the next one is, then you're going to start pushing the envelope top the edge, and you're already tried; that's why you are looking for that rest area. - Participa nt 15 The lack of truck stops, and rest areas were also a concern due to the hours of service regulations. Many drivers reported parking on the side of the road if their hours of service requirements have been met for the day and there were no truck stops/ rest areas. This was noted as being stressful as many drivers then park in areas where safety concerns may exist (e.g., side of the highway; unlit and quiet road). For example, some participants reported needing to leave their trucks and walk a distance to access food and other amenities, and during that time, their Classification: Public48 trucks were either burglarized or had been attempted to be burglarized. Participants noted poor lighting, traffic, inability to sleep due to noise, and being in an unsecure area. When you're goin' down the road, and if they came out with e -log in Canada, where you gonna stop alongside the highway when there's no roadside turn outs?\" - Participant 11 And you get your hours of service, you just wait, you wait till the hours of service and the e-log becomes law, you're gonna have trucks parked all over the god damn place. All over the place. - Participant 24 The participants also provided input on the cu rrent truck stops/rest areas, as well as what they would want to see in newly developed rest areas. More than half of the participants reported that all truck stops, and rest areas should have at least a bathroom and, ideally, running water. Even if truck stops have access to bathrooms and food, many participants noted that the lack of hygiene is a concern. Many participants also wanted showers at the truck stops. A washroom facility, a garbage can, a pull over, you know, garbage can recycle bin side by eac h where you can pull over and stop for an hour or do a walkabout on your like load securement, stuff like this. - Participant 15 What are your thoughts about alcohol use and marijuana legalization? Do you think this will impact the industry? LHTDs were also questioned about drinking alcohol while on the road. They mostly believed it is a common practice among LHTDs to drink after supper , and either drive a little further, or rest for the evening. Although some LHTDs mentioned that drinking might hel p them drive better, a large proportion of them stated that drinking and driving is not safe. lots of drivers will have a drink after supper, they may get in their truck and drive for another four hours . - Participant 9 Classification: Public49 I've seen it first -hand in the wo rkplace, I've seen different guys that just can't put it down or can't stop it or something like that, then an injury occurs, and then fingers pointed and safety's a concern and their job's at risk . - Participant 29 They also talked about their thoughts on the impact of marijuana legalization on trucking industry. Some participants mentioned the legalization of marijuana would not result in an increase in usage while others suggested it was already a problem with roughly 20% of LHTD using the drug. Particip ants mentioned that it was important for companies to have strict policies against alcohol and marijuana use with some even suggesting more frequent screening (random testing). I don't agree it should be there at all because it is trial and error. It im pairs you judgement, it impairs your thinking. It should still be absolutely banned for anyone who is a driver. You know, insurance companies do require a urine test before you can be employed to make sure that you're clean and healthy right? - Participant 14 I worry that not just the lack of experience, but the possibility of impaired driving I think will go up, unfortunately. I really do, with the access it is going to be so easy. It's a guy that takes his lunch break, smokes his joint, then goes back on the road. It needs to be strictly monitored. If we're going to allow this in our society then it needs to be strictly monitored. I think that an 80,000 or 140,000 -pound vehicle rolling down the road, that driver must be completely sober, not a trace of THC . Drug test it; that is what they are doing now . - Participant 86 What are your thoughts about the current state of truck driver training? In the interviews, when asked about available driver training options, participants expressed that they were skeptical of classroom -exclusive training. They did not believe that Classification: Public50 classroom training properly prepares trainees for the occupation as training s chools often teach drivers how to pass the written and practical tests rather than develop the necessary practical skills, such as reversing and breaking, that is associated with behind -the-wheel training. It could be better, there are some driving schools but from what I've seen all they teach them is the rules of the logbook and the basics to get your driver's license. - Participant 76 While some drivers were skeptical of classroom training, they did recognize that it has a place in truck driver educatio n. While the drivers did not mention the number of hours for in - classroom versus practical training, they suggested the length of the training program should be between 8 -12 weeks . The participants noted that practical training should include key skills such as backing -up, air brakes, load securement, learning how to maneuver with full and empty trailers, and training on completing pre -trip inspections. A lot of companies train their drivers in chain schools and give them an empty trailer and they teach th em how to drive and then they go. Poof they're done. Then the company comes in - \"well here is 60 0000 lbs., good luck!\" And they do not know how to stop it. - Participant 35 You need longer training. You need more road time. I think they only allow 10 or 20 hours for learning how to back -up. You're 70 feet long! You need more time learning how to back -up. - Participant 56 One of the key features mentioned for the practical training was how to handle driving in different contexts. LHTD reported the need to practice driving in a wide variety of contexts such as the plains, mountains and winding roads. LHTD also mentioned the need for new drivers to practice driving in traffic congestion, particularly in large cities that have multiple lane Classification: Public51 highways. Additiona lly, drivers emphasized that training ought to encompass exposure to driving in different weather conditions such as on ice and in fog (when visibility is reduced) and at night. You have to be able to drive that truck in different conditions. Driving a tru ck around the city here is not the same as driving a truck over the Coquihalla highway in the middle of the winter . - Participant 9 Give you lots of scenarios... take a trip to the mountains. Winter driving, okay. Umm, hills, hills, and ice roads and city, u rban driving and all kinds of - night driving is another one. - Participant 15 At the conclusion of this 8 -12-week blended learning period, almost a third of participants (31%) said that new drivers should accompany a more senior driver to learn and gain experience on the road. They viewed this as an essential process for trainees to better build their skills in a safe environment that is conducive for asking questions. The duration for which new drivers should accompany a mentor on the road varied among LHT D, ranging from one month to a year, however six months was the most commonly mentioned time period. Sticking with a 14 -hour day to show technique, to show practice and safe procedure. And go over a few things for a few hours, then switch seats and put the new person in the chair and let them drive and try out the techniques so that they have more, better - developed skills. - Participant 14 The participants were adamant that truck driver training and licensing procedures should be standardized across the country. Participants mentioned that in jurisdictions without standardization in training and licensing, certain facilities are prioritizing increasing revenues rather than ensuring safe roads. Classification: Public52 They gotta start watchin' the schools because too many of 'e m they're not training them; they're selling the license. - Participant 67 I'm gonna charge you $5,000 dollars to give you a Class 1 license, the faster I can train you up, the more money I make. - Participant 81 Participants suggested that truck driver p rograms should be offered through accredited or certified schools or those managed by the government, thereby eliminating the opportunity for training institutions to take advantage of a lenient system. They need to put the government back in there, I don 't know what the other provinces do now, but Alberta needs to get their buildings back and start testing, especially the class 1. - Participant 22 Definitely certification from a school, a recognized and accredited school. - Participant 33 Any other conce rns? Participants mentioned a whole range of additional issues from being stressed, dealing with dispatchers and drivers in general who do not have respect for truck drivers, road construction, traffic, and missing family events. Sometimes I think the construction crews don't think when they're putting up their signs, where they put 'em up. I understand that there has to be construction at bottoms of hills and that, but sometimes a little more notice on top the hill . - Participant 4 Idiots on the highway, that's one of the main causes of stress on a job . - Participant 28 Yeah maybe traffic in a big city. But what can you do about that? Just plan better, or make sure you're not there on rush hour. Sometimes you just can't get around it, you ju st Classification: Public53 gotta take it the way it comes. And for stress, sometimes you're a little on the time pressure, but that's part of the job. - Participant 65 Some participants also mentioned that companies should provide bonuses while other said they already receive bon uses such as discount s on fuel, tires and maintenance , as well as safety bonuses. I don't get bonuses. They're cheap. - Participant 42 If you have an incident and they have to repair something, it would come out of your bonus. - Participant 46 Classification: Public54 4. DISCUSSION The findings show that the average age of truck drivers is 50.6 years with most participants being predominantly men, consistent with many other LHTD studies ( Sieber et al. , 2014 ; Angeles et al. , 2014 ). Also consistent with other studies , is the high prevalence of risk factors and medical conditions in the LHTD population. For example, almost 90% were obese, more than 50% smoked, almost 75% had hypertension, and almost a quarter had high cholesterol and sleep problems. Additionally, 17% had diabetes. These rates are substantially higher than the general Canadian population confirming LHTD are a vulnerable grou p requiring interventions to reduce the burden of morbidity. Given the high prevalence of preventable disease and its associated risk with crashes and injuries, Alberta should consider having LHTD undergo an annual medical checkup with physicians associat ed with the Alberta Motor Transport Association (AM TA). Annual medical check -ups serve to identify undiagnosed conditions and ultimately reduce the number of chronic conditions that are associated with occupational health injuries. In the present study , 40% of the sample reported being depressed although only 7.5% reporting taking anti-depressant medications. Additionally, and consistent with Sieber et al. (2014), we found that 27% had self - reported hypertension. However, based on objective blood pressure measurements, more than 90% were pre -hypertensive or hypertensive. The findings show the importance of more routine medical screening to reduce the prevalence of undiagnosed or untreated conditions as only 10.4% of the sample reported visiting a physician for any reason during the past year. Presently, CMV drivers in Alberta are required to provide a self -report of any medical conditions that may impact driving performance every five years. However, it is well known that drivers are unlikely to self -report conditions that may impact driving licensure or employment . In Classification: Public55 the USA , LHTD are required to undergo a medical every two years and is mandatory in order to retain a truck driver license. In Ontario and British Columbia, new truck drivers are required to undergo a medical examination prior to entering the profession, and ever y three years after the age of 45, and every year after the age of 65. Alberta should consider adopting policies requiring truck drivers to obtain a medical certificate indicating their fitness to drive every two years. While each licensing authority can determine its own regulations, the Canadian Council for Motor Transport Administrators (CCMTA, 2020a) suggest that truck drivers be screened for medical conditions every 5 years up to age 45, every 3 years between the age of 45 and 65 years, and annually from age 65. Additionally, there are recommendations for the screening and testing of truck drivers who present with particular medical conditions (CCMTA, 2020a). Our participants, overall, reported having a poor diet. Participants consumed h igh amount of caffeine, salt and sugar while eating few fruits and vegetables. More than 50% of participants reported eating fast food at restaurants due to convenience and cost. These findings are also consistent with the truck stop evaluation, as well as other studies (Sendall et al., 2019 ; Sieber et al., 2014). A prior US study found that 50% of truck stops lacked fresh fruit and 37% fresh vegetables (Lincoln et al., 2016) . Given that poor diet is associated with obesity, hypertension, diabetes and sleep apnea in LHTD (Li et al., 2008 ; Mehta et al. , 2008), providing more opportunities to access healthy foods is paramount for supporting a healthier lifestyle for LHTD (Lincoln et al., 2016). Also, over 50% of the sample reported exercising less than the recommended daily amount (Tremblay et al. , 2017). Many drivers mentioned the sedentary nature of the job due to driving around 13 hours per day. Some drivers reported only being physically active when loading/unloading the truck while other s mentioned t hey might walk around the truck a few Classification: Public56 times once parked. However, many said walking in the parking lots is challenging in the winter due to poor lighting and due to snow/ice. Some recommended installing fitness equipment at truck stops and were willing to pay a fee to access the equipment. The government should consider subsidizing the purchase of fitness equipment at truck stops as none of the truck stops visited as part of this study had any fitness equipment. Fatigue was common among LHTDs and was associated with long work hours, inability to sleep, and stress, consistent with prior studies (Crizzle et al., 2017 ; Hege et al., 2019) . Almost three quarters of the sample believed that fatigue interfered with their daily work and impaired concentration while driving. Additionally, more than 50% reported broken sleep with another 17% having sleep apnea. The Motor Vehicle Acts Regulations (2019) stipulates that for commercial vehicle truck drivers, the number of hours driving should be no more than 13 hour s, with the total number of hours not exceeding 65 hours weekly. From this study, almost a quarter exceed the hours of service requirement. More than 50% of the sample drove more than 175,000 km/year which is considerably higher than the average of 66,000 km/year ( Statistic s Canada , 2003). We found that 33% of the sample were involved in a recordable truck crash with 82% of them being at -fault. Among those that crashed, 20% had three or more crashes. Being involved in a crash was significantly associated with being older, getting less sleep at truck stops, less caffeine intake, being diabetic, less hours spent at home sleeping, weaker grip strength, and fewe r company safety awards. A systematic review found an association between crash risk and fatigue, long work hours, stress, diabetes, narcotic and antihistamine use, as well as working extended shifts (Robb et al. , 2008 ; Caruso , 2015 ). Additionally, m ore than a third of the sample (35%) reported having a near miss that made them lucky to have not been involved in a crash . Classification: Public57 Another 13% reported receiving driving infractions although we do not know what type of violations they received (e.g . speeding, running a red light, driving under the influence). Approximately 10% of the sample reported being injured in the past year. Sprains and strains were the leading types of injuries followed by fractures. Falls w ere the leading reason for sustain ed injuries and w ere significantly associated with being sedentary, obese, and not having prior fall s prevention training. Low back pain was also reported in 36 % of LHTD and was associated with smoking, depression, stress, fatigue, and not having benefits o r company safety policies. The above findings show the importance of having access to benefits in order to access physical therapy or other types of preventative measures to reduce low back injuries and/or falls such as access to exercise equipment especia lly since only 25% of worker compensation claims were approved. Findings from both the survey and the interview show concern over the shortage of truck stops and rest areas in the province. Almost 90% of the LHTD reported not being able to find parking with many spending hours in search for parking spots. In fact, almost 50% report ed losing 1 -2 hours on every trip trying to find parking despite 88% of the sample being familiar with the truck stops and highways routes in Alberta. In an industry wh ere LHTD are paid by the mile, spending 1 -2 hours on each trip in a city trying to find parking increases stress, decreases earning potential and timely deliveries, as well as increases the risk of accidents, robberies and vandalism (from parking on highwa y shoulders or unlit side roads). To address this issue, the Alberta Government, in collaboration with the AM TA, should identify where fatigue -related crashes occur or where distances between rest stops are greater than 200 km, and consider implementing ne w rest stops and/or truck stops, in addition to expanding the parking structures of current truck stops. Classification: Public58 The LHTD also mentioned that they are not satisfied with the current training guidelines for novice truck drivers. They mentioned that a standardized process administered by one recognized organization (e.g. Alberta Motor Transport Association) would be preferred /recommended . In our study, those who did not receive formal training were more likely to crash, underscoring the necessity for mandatory training. The LHTD were skeptical of classroom -exclusive training and believed the current training programs do not adequately prepa re new drivers for the profession. The current in -class training should provide information on federal regulations (e.g. hours of service), safe driving practices and behaviours, proper lifting techniques, fall s prevention, vehicle maintenance and safety c hecks, and security procedures. In addition, LHTD suggested that a practical component be included in the training program, consisting of new drivers spending time with a seasoned driver and learning how to drive (e.g. braking, reversing) in big cities and rural areas, as well as in different driving conditions (ice, mountains). They mostly suggested that the length of the training program should be at least between 8 -12 weeks. The National Safety Code developed and updated regularly by the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators provided national recommendations for driver training. While each provincial licensing authority can determined its own driver training curriculum, according to the NSC, driver training must consist of 36.5 hours of in -classroom training, 17 hours practicing in the yard and 50 hours of behind the wheel training (CCMTA, 2020 b). In Alberta, the mandatory entry -level training program includes training hours for in - class ( 58.5 hours ) (Government of Alberta, 2019) . Truck drivers account for an essential component of the economy . Many LHTD reported positive aspects to the job including being independent, driving across different regions and Classification: Public59 meeting new pe ople. However, they also provided recommendations for how their job could be improved. In addition to issues related to health and wellness, LHTD suggested decreasing unrealistic delivery schedules, improving dispatcher communication, and being paid for lo ading and unloading time, as well as time spent in traffic. Moreover, some LHTD also reported being disrespected by other vehicles (cars) on the highway which has been previously reported in other studies (Johnson et al. , 2011). The sample reported cars on the highway cutting them off, being profane (e.g. sticking up their middle finger) and driving at a slower pace in their lane. To offset some of these issues, LHTD suggested building designated truck lanes on highways, being paid by the hour rather than m ile, enforcing strict traffic laws and maximum speed limits for truckers and cars, and short break after a few hours of continuous driving might significantly help to improve safety in trucking industry. Policy makers and government organizations should be encouraged to talk to truck drivers about their suggestions. Many LHTD reported not being consulted when revising/developing policies which ultimately have an impact on them. To beter address the challenges inherent in the trucking industry, the formaliza tion of a multidi sciplinary and multisectoral committee that includes government, industry, companies, advocacy groups and truck drivers is needed. As a committee, an appropriate strategy could be developed ensuring the goals of all the partners are met (e.g. policies, investment and funding) while also addressing issues on a broader system level . 5. Study Limitation s There are few limitations to the study that need to be taken i nto account . First, the study design was cross -sectional which gives us the prevalence of different chronic diseases and their risk parameters at the time of the assessment . This design demonstrates the association between variables but cannot determine causality. Additionally, the results may have been impacted by Classification: Public60 the sample size. While we wanted to recruit more than 350 drivers, due to time constraints and availability of staff, we could only collec t data on 238 participants. Although this is the largest study to date in Canada, recruiting more drivers may have resulted in a more representative sample despite the fact we used convenience sampling. Another potential limitation is the use of a self -reported questionnaire which is subject to recall and social desirability bias, especially when completed with the researchers in proximity. However, questionnaire findings were triangulated with both objective measurements and the interviews where applicable . And lastly, it is possible there was a selection bias whereby LHTD who were approached and interested may have participated due to their interest in health and wellness or because they were paid by the number of hours worked rather than by the mile. M any drivers who refused participation were in a rush to drive to their next location possibly because they wanted to earn more money and were being paid by the mile . Additionally, some drivers may have participated due to the monetary incentive provided altho ugh prior studies have shown that incentives can increase recruitment (Hsieh & Kocielnik 2016 ). 6. Conclusion Truck drivers account for an essential component of the economy . Improvements in the health and wellness of LHTD can only serve to improve recruitment and retention in a sector that is currently facing a shortage. It is important to note that LHTD reported many positive aspects to working in the industry such as the fre edom a truck driver provides, driving across different regions and meeting new people. Addressing the concerns of LHTD will only serve to improve the working conditions and the health and wellness for drivers in this industry. For a sector as large as the LHTD industry, which is vulnerable to developing chronic health conditions, actions are needed to address the present problems. Many of the issues related to diet (access to healthy Classification: Public61 foods), exercise, fatigue, can be improved through systemic change either through improving the environment/infrastructure or through policies. Recommended interventions need to be multifaceted and jointly conducted by policy makers and LHTD. Such interventions require systemic approaches that consider behavioural risk factors a nd the environment to improve the current challenges that are endemic to the LHTD population.
