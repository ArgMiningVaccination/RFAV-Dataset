If your mind immediately wanders to the salary, anesthesiologists and surgeons both made, on average, more than $230,000 in 2012 \u2014 making them not just the highest-paid medical careers, but the highest-paid occupations in the U.S. that year [source: [Kertzleben](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/03/29/the-10-highest-paid-jobs-in-america)]. Yet neither of these two careers is considered to be the best health care job, or the one that brings the most happiness or fun. It's dentists who are said to have it the best overall [sources: [U.S. News & World Report](http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-healthcare-jobs), [Kim](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/12-demand-health-care-jobs/story?id=21100548)].

Say, athletic trainer: fun job. Travel nurse: fun job. Biomechanical engineer: fun job. Wait, biomechanical engineer? You know, the people who design bionic eyes, robo-hands, non-invasive glucose monitors \u2014 you'll see. First, though, let's take a moment for emotional expression with a music therapist.
