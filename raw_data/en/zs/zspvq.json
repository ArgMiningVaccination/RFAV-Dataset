It can be used alone as a paper instrument, but it s full potential is reached when the data from this form is entered into the CDR Case Reporting System . This system is available to states from the National Center for the Review & Prevention of Child Deaths and require s a data use agreement for state and local data entry. System fu nctions include data entry, case report, editing and printing, data download and standardized reports. The purpose of this form is to collect comprehensive information from multiple agencies participating in a child death review. The form documents the circumstances involved in the death, investigative actions, services provided or needed, key risk factors and actions recommend ed and/or taken by the CDR team to prevent other deaths. While this data collection form is an important part of the child death review process, the form should not be the central focu s of the review meeting. Experienced users have found that it works best to assign a person to record data while the team discussions are occurring. Pe rsons should not attempt to answer every single question in a step-by-step manner as part of the team discussion. The form can be partially fil led out before a meeting. It is not expected that teams will have answers to all of the questions related to a death. However, over time teams begin to understand the importance of data collection and bring the necessary information to the meeting. They find that the percentage of unknowns and unanswere d questions decreases as the team becomes more familiar with the form. The form contains three types of questions: (1) Those that users should only select one response as represented by a circle; (2) Those in which users can select multiple responses as represented by a square; and (3) Those in which users enter text. This last type is indicated by the words 'spec ify' or 'describe'. Most questions have a selection for unknown (U/K). A question should be marked 'unknown' if an attempt was made to find the an swer but no clear or satisfactory response was obtained. A question should be left blank (unanswered) if no attempt was made to find the answer. 'N/A' stands for 'Not Applicable' and should be used if the question is not applicable. This edition is Version 3.0, effective October 2013. Additional paper forms can be ordered from the National Center at no char ge. Users interested in participating in the web-based case reporting system for dat a entry and reporting should contact the National Center for the Review & Prevention of Child Deaths. This form was first developed in 2004 by a work group of over 26 persons, representing 18 states and the Maternal and Child Bureau of HRSA/HHS. Many of the Sudden and Unexpected Infant Deaths (SUID) variables were identified in consultation w ith national SUID experts, in partnership with the CDC Division of Repr oductive Health. The programming work to support the development of Version 3.0 was generously funded in-kind by Vantage Systems, Inc.Copyright: National Center for the Review & Prevention of Child Deaths, October 2013Child Death Review Case Re portin g System Case Report Version 3.0 and Why Children Die &Taking Action to Prevent Child Deaths Page 1 of 20CASE NUMBER Case Type: Death Death Certificate Number: ______ /__________________/_____________/_________________Near death/serious injury Birth Certificate Number: State / County or Team Number / Year of Review / Sequence of Review Not born alive ME/Coroner Number: Date CDRT Notified of of death: U/K 4.
