Since the immune system is our strongest armour for protecting from recurrent infections, we must enhance this by indulging in healthy eating, fitness-driven lifestyle and positive mental health to build immunity. Lifestyle modifications today, will certainly boost the immunity tomorrow! There are various factors that can affect one's immunity, such as age, nutritional status, gut health, fitness levels, sleep, psychologic stress, mental health, immune compromised conditions and other associated morbid conditions. According to Science and research, for an infection to develop in human body, there needs to be three key factors, known as an epidemiological triad - an infectious agent (virus or bacteria), a favourable environment (our natural surroundings) and, a susceptible host (human). If we keep the 'agent' out of this equation, as we have poor control on it, we can still at least choose to control the 'environment' by ensuring it is a clean, safe, unpolluted and natural environment, and also boost the immunity of the 'host' so that he/she doesn't become vulnerable to the infection or post-covid complications. Just like most viral infections, recovery from COVID also takes a minimum of 2 weeks (for mild cases) and about a month for people with serious symptoms, provided certain lifestyle protocols are diligently followed for recovery. If we are not cautious about our own health it can lead to various subclinical discomforts in the future. We now know that we can have an excellent recovery rate (now which is above 90%) even post the COVID infection. People who contract this infection are recovering well and slowly manage to get back to their old lifestyle. For others, while the virus may not be active in our body, we still need to be cautious about what we do in our daily lives to stay immune and healthy.SUPER IMMUNITY Post Covid RecoveryAtmantan's SUPER IMMUNITY Programme which boosts the post COVID Recovery is a highly efficient retreat programme that addresses various aspects of your health, where our doctors improve your health parameters in an integrated manner. We use experiential knowledge from traditional medicines such as Ayurveda, Naturopathy, Yoga and Traditional Chinese medicine, and combine them with evidence-based knowledge of fitness, nutrition, physiotherapy and functional medicine. We boost the immunity through prescribed diet, stress management, improved sleep, fresh air, unpolluted environment, fitness, yoga and exposure to nature. We also focus on treating co-morbid conditions that weaken the immunity . Guest healthcare and safety is our topmost priority. Our doctors will do an initial evaluation before you arrive and will advise you on the recommended duration for your retreat. The minimum duration is 7 nights. On the day of your arrival, your consulting doctor will prescribe your treatment plan based on your health profile and symptoms. The inclusions mentioned below are indicative.

It is essentially needed for those who want to focus and build on their adaptive immunity and reduce their vulnerability. We are sensitive towards the challenges we face today in this pandemic and hence have curated a programme that is personalized for people of all ages and capabilities. Beyond focusing on the body mass index, we give importance to mind, emotional, intellectual and spiritual mass indexes. Some of our KEY AREAS OF FOCUS will be... Exercise and Immunity Yoga and Immunity Diet and Immunity Mindfulness and Positive Thinking Living with Nature Sleep Sanctuary NATURAL HEALING Around 60%-70% of all health care visits are for lifestyle-based diseases and simply, put the preventable diseases! These lifestyle diseases like cancer, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and other non-communicable diseases and other non-communicable diseases are today amongst the fastest growing causes of death and disability around the globe.Lifestyle diseases are defined as diseases linked with the way people live their life. This is commonly caused by bad lifestyle choices which could include alcohol consumption, drug abuse and smoking, as well as lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating. (Diseases that impact our lifestyle are heart disease, stroke, obesity, type II diabetes, arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, pulmonary disease, metabolic syndrome, chronic renal failure, osteoporosis, stroke, depression, obesity and vascular dementia). While modern medicine can manage these diseases most of the time, these come with some unwanted side effects. Ironically, these diseases appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer! It might hence seem counterintuitive cause as a nation becomes more affluent, there is a significant rise in lifestyle-based or non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and auto-immune diseases. And this happens quite predictably more when urbanization occurs, per capita income rises & wealth is created; As a result of this very wealth and affluence, our dietary and lifestyles choices raise the risk of these NCDs. A simple example of how we are each at risk as we become affluent: With the use of motorized vehicles and electronic devices (Mobiles, laptop, etc) our physical activity has been hampered and we are most likely notice a consequent spike in obesity, high blood pressure (hypertension), depressions, elevated blood glucose levels, higher lipids, etc. These risk factors in turn increases our odds of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, hormonal imbalances, inflammation, and gut related diseases. This becomes a daily Vicious Cycle that we land living within!Disease Management Retreat External factors indirectly influencing- social/environmental Globalization | Urbanization | Ageing process | Digitalization Basic modifiable risk factors Sedentary lifestyle Improper diet Inadequate sleep Lack of social support Improper posture Non-modifiable risk factors Age GeneticsResulting Chronic illness Diabetes Heart disease Stroke Cancer PCOD Chronic respiratory diseases Autoimmune diseaseIntermediate risk factors Obesity High blood pressure Elevated blood sugar High cholesterol High visceral fat Leaky gut InsomniaATMANTAN Wellness Center, Mulshi, Pune Maharashtra, India +91 20 | E : info@atmantan.com | W : www.atmantan.com Doctor's Consultations Body Composition Analysis Postural Assessment Daily Group Classes Yoga Therapy Sessions Yoga, Breathing and Meditation Classes Health Talks on Various Topics Therapeutic Food Fresh Herbal Medicines Recommended Naturopathy Treatments and TherapiesRETREAT INCLUSIONS Minimum Stay: 7 Nights* T&C ApplyThe following are some of the conditions that are attended to:The time has come to consciously step out of the Vicious Cycle into the Virtuous Cycle Of Good Health!

It aims to find the root causes and then help boost the natural healing mechanisms to target them. The doctors then prescribe a treatment procedure including diet protocols, lifestyle regime, etc. for the duration of your stay at Atmantan.Along with a daily diet fitness and treatment monitoring, guests are also encouraged to better learn & practice healthier lifestyle handling methods (through participation in the various health talks and ailment reversal techniques). During the departure consultation, a detailed follow up document is given to every guest on home care along with advice on dietary prescriptions and supplements. This NATURAL HEALING RETREAT is essentially a highly effective disease management program for a wide range of lifestyle & auto-immune conditions; the duration of the retreat is decided upon by the medical team post the screening of the condition only (& mostly prior to arrival). At Atmantan, the NATURAL HEALING RETREATwhile being highly result-oriented has in most cases also enabled a reversal for the above diseases. While at times it takes from 3 to 6 months for significant recovery, depending on the severity of the ailment, our programmes are customized to the individual's conditions, wherein the doctors monitors the condition both in-house as periodically on check-out of the guest as well. Our Holistic Medicine Doctors plan comprehensive & integrated treatment procedures; this blends the best of modern medical science and traditional natural medical approaches to not only treat disease, but to also restore health.
