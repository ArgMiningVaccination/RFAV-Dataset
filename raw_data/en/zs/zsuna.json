Excessive wait times when there is literally no other patient here. Office hasn't been updated in 20 years at least. Doesn't feel premium, clean, comfortable. My appointment has taken almost an hour and a half and we haven't even run tests. - 12/2/2021First to Review I rate this location a 0 !! Staff at front was unprofessional and not knowledgeable! Dr who took care of me used his stethoscope to check my belts heart rate!! He had the tremors the whole time he took care of me. Closed his eyes and was rude. I will never come back here . Don't recommend I would rather drive to a different state before I come here again. Dr was a idiot. Never again - 2/1/2022 This allergy center is about money only. I went there and was told I need a pneumonia vaccination. They wrote me a prescription for the vaccination that nobody would administer. Not Walgreens, CVS, Publix, walk in clinic, my own personal doctor or the allergy center. I spent the entire day trying to find someone to give me the shot. After talking to the allergy center about four times that day, we came to the conclusion... nothing could be done. I told them to take be off there office list as I would not be coming back. Instead they charged me $50 for a missed appointment for something they could not do. "}
