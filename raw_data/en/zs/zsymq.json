Our mission is to enhance the value of all products that are built with Natur-Al. We want manufacturers to use our product with pride, and to gain an edge in the highly competitive markets for consumer goods, vehicles, packaging and construction materials. Pure Aluminum for Premium Products Natur-Al aluminum has direct CO levels below two tonnes CO per tonne of aluminium - one of the lowest CO footprints in the world for aluminum. The total CO footprint is four tonnes per tonne aluminum, less than one-quarter of the industry average. To achieve these levels requires strict adherence to the highest standards in the sourcing of bauxite and alumina, the exclusive use of Icelandic energy, and seamless operation of the reduction processes. Natur-Al Benefits Direct and indirect CO emissions less than one-quarter of the industry average Traceability from mine to metal Data available for use in life cycle analysis of finished products Third party verification of CO emissions ASI Certified for responsible production, sourcing and stewardship of aluminum ASI Certified - Made in Iceland Natur-Al products are made at our Nor\u00f0ur\u00e1l aluminum plant in Iceland.
