Until recently, patients had limited options to simultaneously alleviate pain and correct underlying problems. Pain medications mask pain, but don't address the source of the pain. Long-term use may lead to addiction or other health complications. Epidural injections provide temporary relief, but come with risks such as injection site infection. Today there is a pain-free, non-surgical solution that restores your health and relieves pains without risks associated with temporary treatments. If this interests you, here are some frequently asked questions about [DRS Protocol in Little Rock](/). The DRS Protocol (Decompression, Reduction and Stabilization) is a non-invasive protocol used to treat patients with disc-related conditions associated with low back and neck pain. The best way to determine if the DRS Protocol is the best treatment option for you is to schedule an appointment at our Little Rock office for a thorough examination of your spine and an overall health assessment. Our clinic uses advanced technology developed by a team of multidisciplinary professionals including chiropractors, neurologists, physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons to treat the following conditions: - Failed back surgeries - Bulging/herniated discs - Degenerative disc disease - Facet Syndrome - Numbness and tingling of extremities Extensive clinical studies confirm thousands of patients have achieved long-lasting results with Spinal Decompression Therapy with no side effects or resulting debilitating conditions commonly associated with long-term pain medication use and surgical procedures. Treatment is painless, in fact, many people report the treatments are relaxing. Every patient is different. Decompression Therapy utilizes a computerized device to relieve pressure over a series of visits by gently pulling on the compressed disc creating pain and discomfort. As spinal column discs and nerves regain proper alignment pain diminishes and the spine is returned to a more normal, healthy condition. Patients report less pain, better range of motion and increased mobility after treatment. Along with decompression therapy, we may recommend alternative solutions including customized physical therapy programs, chiropractic treatments and braces to stabilize your spinal column. In addition to the alternatives and complementary treatments listed above, some patients achieve positive results with electrical muscle stimulation or ultrasound to promote healing. Not everyone will benefit from non-surgical spinal decompression. For example, people with tumors and advanced osteoporosis are not good candidates. If you have questions about starting a non-surgical spinal decompression treatment plan, please [contact our Little Rock office](/contact-us) today to schedule a thorough physical examination.
