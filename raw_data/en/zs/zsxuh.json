Ask the office how far in advance you usually need to call to make a follow-up appointment so you can get an idea of how hard it is to get in to see this particular doctor or therapist.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><b>Can I contact you during a crisis?</b> Nights, weekends, and holidays \u2014 the three times you most need your doctor or therapist, they're at home, spending time with their friends and family. The nerve of these medical people! Everybody, even doctors and therapists, needs some time off, but as a person with bipolar disorder, you need some numbers to call in a crisis. Doctors and therapists have a variety of systems for after-hours emergencies. Ask for your doctor's policy and procedures, which should include the following information:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul class=\\\"level-two\\\">\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><b>Office number: </b>When you call the office after hours, a recorded message should provide instructions for emergency calls.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><b>After-hours number:</b> Does the doctor use an answering service that can reach them? Do you call their cellphone or home phone for emergencies? Make sure you're clear about this.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><b>Name and number of the person who covers for the doctor or therapist when they're out: </b>Doctors often take turns being on call.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><b>Emergency number of the hospital or mental health center where you should go in a crisis: </b>If you're in the middle of a mental health crisis and you can't get in touch with your doctor, where should you go?</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"child-para Tip\\\">Ask how long it typically takes your doctor or therapist to return calls if you need to leave a message.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><b>What's the diagnosis and how did you arrive at it?</b> Sometimes a doctor prescribes medication without providing a final diagnosis, especially when some uncertainty exists. For example, if a patient is experiencing mania, the doctor may prescribe an antimanic medication without diagnosing bipolar disorder until they have the opportunity to rule out other possibilities.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"child-para\\\">However, your doctor will have some ideas (<i>working diagnoses, </i>as they're often called) that drive their treatment choices. If your doctor doesn't mention a diagnosis, ask them to explain their thinking and the possible diagnoses they're considering. You have a right to understand what they think may be going on and why they're choosing particular treatment plans.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"child-para Remember\\\">How your doctor arrived at your diagnosis may be just as important as the diagnosis itself. Make sure your doctor has considered your family history, any prior mood episodes, the possibility of medication- or substance-induced symptoms, other medical conditions that may be causing symptoms, and aspects of your life that may be causing stress or sleeplessness or is otherwise contributing to symptoms.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><b>What's the treatment plan?</b> Your doctor may hand you one or more prescriptions for antidepressants, antimanics, antipsychotics, or sedatives, but your medication doesn't make up your complete treatment plan. In most cases, you should have a doctor and a therapist; ideally, they work together to develop a treatment plan specifically for you. The doctor typically handles the medications, and the therapist deals with everything else, although some doctors are more actively involved in the bigger treatment picture.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">Your treatment plan should possibly, family therapy</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">Instructions on what to do if your moods begin to cycle</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"child-para\\\">Whenever your doctor recommends a change in medication, be sure to ask what the goal of the change is and how you and your doctor will evaluate whether the change met its objective.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"child-para\\\">In the real world, having ready access to a psychiatrist and therapist isn't always possible. In such cases, you may find yourself relying on your primary-care physician, self-help, lifestyle changes, family and friends, and community resources.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><b>When can I expect to feel better?</b> Your doctor and therapist are likely to tell you to remain patient, but you should know upfront what <i>patient</i> means. A week? A month? Two months? In most cases, you can expect to see some improvement in one to two weeks, but some medications may take four to six weeks or even longer to become fully effective. Ask your doctor and therapist to be sure.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"child-para\\\">Typically, your doctor will follow up with you two to four weeks after your initial appointment or after you start a new medication to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and monitor for side effects. If you're feeling very unstable, they may want to see you even sooner. If the doctor tells you to come back in more than one month after you start a new medicine, find out why they don't want to follow your situation more closely.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><b>How will I know I'm getting better?</b> With bipolar disorder, feeling better may convince you that you <i>are</i> better even when you're not, particularly if you're cycling into mania. Ask your doctor for more objective signs that your mental health is improving.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"child-para\\\">When an episode of depression is lifting, you may experience these signs:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul class=\\\"level-two\\\">\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">Sleeping more regularly and getting better-quality sleep</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">Doing more with less effort suicide</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"child-para\\\">When recovering from an episode of mania, these signs may appear:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul class=\\\"level-two\\\">\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">More sleep in general and less restless sleep overall</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">Sustained stability in thought patterns \u2014 not racing or flying from topic to topic</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">Reduction in <i>pressured speech</i> and less intense confrontations should I do if I feel worse?</b> Getting just the right combination of medications requires communication between you and your doctor. Being able to get in touch with your doctor between visits is especially important when you're first starting medicine. Some medications may not work for you or may have an adverse effect on you. If your condition fails to improve or worsens or if you have a bad reaction to the medication (such as a rash or shortness of breath), contact your doctor, who may suggest one or more of the following steps:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul class=\\\"level-two\\\">\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">Stop taking the medication.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">Keep taking the medication to see whether the side effect settles down or the desired effects kick in and then call or come in to the office in a few days.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">Take a lower dose of the medication.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n a higher dose of the medication.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">Add something else to the medication.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"child-para\\\">Be sure to follow up all these actions with additional phone calls or office visits to further optimize your treatment plan.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><b>How did you pick this medicine and what can happen when I take it?</b> Most doctors hand you a prescription for the medications they think are going to be most effective and have the least chance of causing serious side effects. The doctor should always review with you how they chose this medicine over other ones (alternatives) and carefully review the potential effects and side effects of the medicine they have chosen to prescribe. Make sure that your doctor has answered the following questions for you before they reach for the prescription pad:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul class=\\\"level-two\\\">\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">How effective is the medication at treating the symptoms I have?</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">Are there more effective medications?</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">What are the potential risks and side effects of this medication, and what are the chances that I'll experience them?</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">Are there any medications that may have fewer, less serious side effects?</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\">How will this medicine interact with other prescribed medications and over-the-counter products and with other substances including alcohol and caffeine?</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"child-para\\\">Make sure you always know the possible side effects and interactions of a medication before you begin taking it so you know what to watch for. Armed with a list of the most common and most serious potential side effects, ask what you should do if you notice any signs that you may be experiencing one of them.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><b>Will you work with my other providers?</b> Coordinated treatment, especially between your doctor and therapist, is an essential component of success. Ask your doctor and therapist if they're willing to exchange notes. Make sure they have each other's contact information and signed consent forms that enable them to share information.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"child-para\\\">If you want family members, friends, and other nonprofessionals to enter the treatment discussion, ask the doctors if they're willing to talk with the people in your support network. Your doctor and therapist can't legally discuss your condition or treatment with anyone unless you've signed consent forms for them.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\",\"description\":\"To be a savvy consumer in the world of doctors and therapists, you have to assess your caregiver's credentials and qualifications, make informed treatment choices for your bipolar disorder, determine how you can tell if treatment is working, and know what to do if you begin feeling worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article provides a list of questions to ask a psychiatrist or therapist to obtain the information you need. (If you have other questions, write them down so you remember to ask them.)\\r\\n<p class=\\\"Remember\\\">Research shows that medical outcomes improve dramatically when patients are empowered to ask questions and actively participate in their care. Don't assume that the doctor has all the answers and will tell you everything you need to know. Be proactive!

Still others specialize in treating children and adolescents.</p>\\r\\nProfessionals who have more experience in treating bipolar disorder may be more attuned to the many ways people experience bipolar disorder and better equipped to sort through your history and ask pertinent questions to effectively identify patterns of your condition.

The outer layer of the brain is called the <i>cortex,</i> often referred to as the gray matter. The layer beneath the cortex is a network of fibers that connect different areas of the brain, often referred to as the white matter. The fibers are protected and insulated by a layer called the <i>myelin sheath.</i>\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the brain is a system of cavities, including spaces called the ventricles, that make, circulate, and then reabsorb <i>cerebrospinal fluid.</i> This fluid serves as a mechanical shock absorber to the brain but also brings nutrients from and filters waste back into the blood stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother important component of brain anatomy is comprised of cells that make up all of these structures. Brain cells include neurons and glia<i>.</i>\\r\\n<ul class=\\\"level-one\\\">\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><i>Neurons</i> form the telecommunications system in the brain and body, dictating body functions by generating, sending, and reacting to electrochemical signals.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><i>Glial cells,</i> once thought to be just a support network for neurons, play a major role in brain function and in the brain's communications and reaction systems.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nThe gray matter of the cortex includes the <i>cell bodies</i> (central section) and <i>dendrites</i> (one of the connecting ends) of neurons, as well as glial cells. The white matter is made up of the <i>axons</i> (another type of connecting end) of neurons.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab4\\\" >Understanding how brain cells communicate</h2>\\r\\nNeurons communicate with one another in many different ways, but communication occurs primarily across the <i>synapse \u2014</i> the space between neurons or between neurons and other cells, such as a gland or muscle cell. The most common type of communication occurs when one end of the neuron (often the axon, but not always) releases a chemical messenger into the synapse (as shown in the figure below). The next cell (often the dendrite of another neuron) receives the chemical Born, MA[/caption]Receptors on the outside of the second cell latch onto the chemical messenger. Cells have many different types of receptors for all of the chemical messengers; the type of receptor influences how the message is received and processed and how the instructions are transmitted to the second cell.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a chemical messenger occupies the receptor, it can generate many different responses in the receiving cell, depending on the chemical messenger and the receptor type. After the messenger has done its job, it's released from the receptor and then taken back into the first cell, a process called <i>reuptake.</i> In the brain, the chemical messengers are often referred to as <i>neurotransmitters.</i>\\r\\n\\r\\nNervous system cells communicate in ways beyond the synapse. For example, chemicals called <i>neuropeptides</i> communicate between cells but not across synapses. Of great importance in the current research on bipolar disorder is the communication between glial cells and neurons.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisruptions in these communication systems may be at least as important as problems in neuron-to-neuron transmissions. <i>Intracellular</i> (within-cell) communication may also play a role.\",\"description\":\"Pinpointing the location of bipolar disorder in your brain is almost as difficult as finding affordable health insurance.

The outer layer of the brain is called the <i>cortex,</i> often referred to as the gray matter. The layer beneath the cortex is a network of fibers that connect different areas of the brain, often referred to as the white matter. The fibers are protected and insulated by a layer called the <i>myelin sheath.</i>\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the brain is a system of cavities, including spaces called the ventricles, that make, circulate, and then reabsorb <i>cerebrospinal fluid.</i> This fluid serves as a mechanical shock absorber to the brain but also brings nutrients from and filters waste back into the blood stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother important component of brain anatomy is comprised of cells that make up all of these structures. Brain cells include neurons and glia<i>.</i>\\r\\n<ul class=\\\"level-one\\\">\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><i>Neurons</i> form the telecommunications system in the brain and body, dictating body functions by generating, sending, and reacting to electrochemical signals.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n \\t<li>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><i>Glial cells,</i> once thought to be just a support network for neurons, play a major role in brain function and in the brain's communications and reaction systems.</p>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\nThe gray matter of the cortex includes the <i>cell bodies</i> (central section) and <i>dendrites</i> (one of the connecting ends) of neurons, as well as glial cells. The white matter is made up of the <i>axons</i> (another type of connecting end) of neurons.\\r\\n<h2 id=\\\"tab4\\\" >Understanding how brain cells communicate</h2>\\r\\nNeurons communicate with one another in many different ways, but communication occurs primarily across the <i>synapse \u2014</i> the space between neurons or between neurons and other cells, such as a gland or muscle cell. The most common type of communication occurs when one end of the neuron (often the axon, but not always) releases a chemical messenger into the synapse (as shown in the figure below). The next cell (often the dendrite of another neuron) receives the chemical Born, MA[/caption]Receptors on the outside of the second cell latch onto the chemical messenger. Cells have many different types of receptors for all of the chemical messengers; the type of receptor influences how the message is received and processed and how the instructions are transmitted to the second cell.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a chemical messenger occupies the receptor, it can generate many different responses in the receiving cell, depending on the chemical messenger and the receptor type. After the messenger has done its job, it's released from the receptor and then taken back into the first cell, a process called <i>reuptake.</i> In the brain, the chemical messengers are often referred to as <i>neurotransmitters.</i>\\r\\n\\r\\nNervous system cells communicate in ways beyond the synapse. For example, chemicals called <i>neuropeptides</i> communicate between cells but not across synapses. Of great importance in the current research on bipolar disorder is the communication between glial cells and neurons.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisruptions in these communication systems may be at least as important as problems in neuron-to-neuron transmissions. <i>Intracellular</i> (within-cell) communication may also play a role.\",\"blurb\":\"\",\"authors\":[{\"authorId\":9016,\"name\":\"Candida

is bipolar disorder?\",\"thumb\":null,\"image\":null,\"content\":\"<p>Bipolar disorder is a physical illness that affects the brain. A bipolar diagnosis requires at least one episode of <em>mania</em> (often characterized by high energy, racing thoughts, irritability, and rapid speech that negatively affect one's ability to function) or <em>hypomania</em> (a less severe form of mania.)</p>\\n<p>Also, the disorder typically includes episodes of depression that alternate with the mania or hypomania. Your specific diagnosis depends on your symptoms.</p>\\n<h3>Bipolar disorder diagnostic categories</h3>\\n<p>In the U.S., doctors refer to the <em>Diagnostic and</em> <em>Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> <em>(DSM),</em> which provides several different categories for bipolar disorder:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Bipolar I:</strong> The classic form of bipolar disorder is diagnosed when someone experiences at least one manic episode. Most people with Bipolar I also experience periods of major depression, and these are referred to as bipolar depressive episodes.</li>\\n<li><strong>Bipolar II: </strong>People with bipolar II experience hypomanic episodes and recurrent major depressive episodes. If mania enters the picture, the diagnosis changes to bipolar I.</li>\\n<li>\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><strong>Cyclothymic disorder: </strong>This is a chronic cycling mood disorder characterized by numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that aren't enough to qualify as hypomanic episodes and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that aren't enough to qualify as depressive episodes.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"child-para\\\">Symptoms must last at least two years in adults and one year in children and adolescents. These symptoms must be present at least half the time with no symptom-free period lasting longer than two months.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"child-para\\\">Additionally, for a diagnosis of Bipolar I or II or cyclothymic disorder, symptoms must not be caused by substances or a medical condition, cannot be attributed to schizoaffective disorder, and the pattern of shifting mood states must cause significant distress or impairment in important areas of function.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder:</strong> Bipolar symptoms can be attributed to intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol or medication side effects.</li>\\n<li><a name=\\\"_Toc414459846\\\"></a><a name=\\\"_Toc414462927\\\"></a><strong>Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition</strong><strong>: </strong>Bipolar symptoms can be attributed to another medical condition, such as <em>hyperthyroidism</em> (overactive thyroid).</li>\\n<li><a name=\\\"_Toc414362692\\\"></a><a name=\\\"_Toc414459847\\\"></a><a name=\\\"_Toc414462928\\\"></a><strong>Other specified bipolar and related disorder</strong><strong>:</strong> Introduced in DSM-5, this category enables doctors to diagnose bipolar disorder when symptoms characteristic of bipolar disorder significantly impair normal function or cause considerable distress but don't quite meet the full diagnostic criteria for the other bipolar diagnostic classes.</li>\\n<li>\\n<p class=\\\"first-para\\\"><strong>Unspecified bipolar disorder: </strong>This form of bipolar involves variations of cycling moods that resemble manic or depressive episodes and interfere with daily routines but don't fulfill the complete diagnostic requirements for the other classifications of bipolar disorder in this list.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"child-para\\\">This diagnosis is used instead of <em>other specified bipolar and related disorder</em> when a doctor, for whatever reason, doesn't want to go into detail about why the criteria for a specific bipolar diagnosis hasn't been met; for example, in emergency room settings.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Bipolar disorder specifiers</h3>\\n<p>The DSM provides <em>specifiers</em> that enable doctors to more fully describe the person's condition:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Current or most recent episode: or absence of psychosis: </strong>Delusional thinking, paranoia, or hallucinations that may accompany depression or mania</li>\\n<li><strong>Course of illness: </strong>Active (with or without psychosis), in partial remission, or in full remission</li>\\n<li><strong>With anxious distress: </strong>If symptoms include significant anxiety symptoms</li>\\n<li><strong>With mixed features: </strong>For example, mania with symptoms of depression, such as guilt, hopelessness, or suicidal thoughts; or depression with symptoms of mania, such as physical agitation and racing thoughts</li>\\n<li><strong>With rapid cycling: </strong>Characterized by four or more mood episodes in a 12-month period</li>\\n<li><strong>With melancholic features: </strong>Extreme energy</li>\\n<li><strong>With atypical features: </strong>Symptoms that used to be considered less typical of depression but are now recognized as frequent features of depression (for example, sleeping too much)</li>\\n<li><strong>With catatonia: </strong>A state of minimal responsiveness to the environment and abnormal movement</li>\\n<li><strong>With peripartum onset: </strong>The bipolar mood episode occurs any time during pregnancy or in the four weeks after delivery</li>\\n<li><strong>With seasonal pattern: </strong>Mood episodes follow a pattern corresponding to the seasons or specific times of year</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If left untreated, bipolar disorder (and other mental health disorders) could become so severe that a person suffering from them might experience thoughts of self-harm.

Medications can be categorized by the conditions they're commonly used to treat. See below.</p>\\n<h3><strong>Medications for t</strong><strong>reating mania</strong></h3>\\n<p>Medications that target mania include lithium; certain anticonvulsants, such valproate (Depakote); antipsychotic haloperidol (Haldol). Acute mania is a medical emergency, and doctors often layer antimanic agents to help resolve symptoms quickly.</p>\\n<h3><strong>Medications for</strong> <strong>treating bipolar depression</strong></h3>\\n<p>Bipolar depression doesn't respond to medications the same way that unipolar depression does. Medications that specifically treat bipolar depression include quetiapine (Seroquel), lurasidone (Latuda), and olanzapine (Zyprexa) called Symbyax.</p>\\n<p>However, treating bipolar depression is challenging and treatments can expand to include other medications, such as lithium; the anticonvulsant lumateperone (Caplyta).</p>\\n<p>Antidepressants can be less effective in bipolar depression and can trigger manic symptoms, but they are still used in many situations. These include the selective serotonin reuptake (Pristiq).</p>\\n<p>Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is another antidepressant that is sometimes used to treat bipolar depression.</p>\\n<h3><strong>Antipsychotics</strong></h3>\\n<p>Antipsychotics were originally developed to help treat schizophrenia, but they're often also useful in treating psychosis that sometimes accompanies acute mania or depression.</p>\\n<p>Some medications in this category also have antidepressant effects. This group includes the first-generation medications that are continued after an acute mood episode to reduce the likelihood that another mood cycle will occur. Usually, the doctor will continue whatever medication(s) that helped to reduce the mania and/or depression, such as lithium and valproate (Depakote), often with an antipsychotic.</p>\\n<p>One of the goals in preventive management is to reduce medications when possible, and sometimes the antipsychotics can be removed at some point.</p>\\n<p>The anti-convulsant lamotrigine (Lamictal) is an effective maintenance medication for some people, but it doesn't treat acute mania.</p>\\n<h3><strong>Antianxiety medications</strong></h3>\\n<p>Antianxiety medications medications aren't used to treat the bipolar disorder itself but to help with the commonly co-occurring symptoms of anxiety or agitation.</p>\\n<h3><strong>Sleep aids</strong></h3>\\n<p>Because sleeplessness often accompanies mania or depression and may exacerbate it, doctors may prescribe sedative/hypnotics, such as zolpidem (Ambien), eszopiclone (Lunesta), and zaleplon (Sonata). or the melatonin receptor antagonist ramelteon (Rozerem); or a newer class of sleep medications called dual orexin receptor antagonists, such as suvorexant (Belsomra).</p>\\n<p>Sometimes, doctors prescribe other medications to use their sedating side effects, such as the older antidepressants These aren't used to treat bipolar symptoms, but rather to help manage sleep issues that often affect people with bipolar and that can complicate the illness.</p>\\n<p><strong>Note<em>:</em></strong> Other treatments target the biology of the brain, including light therapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS).</p>\\n<p>These therapies, like medication, are designed to treat bipolar from the inside out via the brain. Other therapies and self-help strategies, including interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT), mindfulness training, and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), help manage bipolar from the outside in.</p>\\n\"},{\"title\":\"Maintaining mood stability\",\"thumb\":null,\"image\":null,\"content\":\"<p>The overall treatment plan for helping a person with bipolar disorder achieve and maintain mood stability is fairly straightforward:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Take your medications as prescribed, even when you're feeling well, and consult your doctor before making any medication changes.</li>\\n<li>Establish routines that ensure a regular sleep-wake schedule. Lack of quality sleep is related to mood instability and is often a warning sign of an impending mood episode.</li>\\n<li>Ingest more of the stuff that nourishes and supports you and less of the stuff that increase the risks of mood episodes. Heavy use of cannabis and alcohol are particularly high risk when managing bipolar disorder.</li>\\n<li>Exercise. Try to remain physically active. Even a relaxing 30-minute walk or 1 to 5 minutes of intensive exercise a few times a week can help health and mood.</li>\\n<li>Monitor your moods and seek help sooner rather than later. Early intervention can prevent major mood meltdowns.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\"},{\"title\":\"10 ways to help a loved-one with bipolar disorder\",\"thumb\":null,\"image\":null,\"content\":\"<p>If a loved one has bipolar disorder, you're probably wondering what you can do to help. Although your loved one ultimately decides what your level of involvement will be, the two of you may want to consider the following ways you can help:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Get educated.</strong> Knowing what your loved one is dealing with leads to understanding and empathy, which are essential to becoming an effective support person.</li>\\n<li><strong>Establish a structured schedule.</strong> Daily routines, especially consistent sleep-wake cycles, are important for mood stability and are much easier for your loved one to maintain in a supportive, structured household.</li>\\n<li><strong>Tone down the volume and emotions.</strong> Intense emotional reactions, in particular criticism and hostility may contribute to mood instability, so try to maintain a relatively calm atmosphere.</li>\\n<li><strong>Avoid the four big communication no-nos.</strong> Criticism, blame, judgment, and demand are likely to drive a wedge between you and your loved one. Ban them from your interactions.</li>\\n<li><strong>Hone your communication skills.</strong> <em>How</em> you say something is often as important as <em>what</em> you say when talking with others. Establish a receptive forum by using effective communication techniques.</li>\\n<li><strong>Establish boundaries and respect autonomy.</strong> Loved ones with bipolar disorder maintain their autonomy to make decisions, except in extreme circumstances \u2014 when their symptoms create a risk of harm to themselves or others. Bipolar often limits insight into the illness, and your loved one's decisions may frustrate you. Try to stay connected without trying to control them. The long-term picture is best served by respecting their humanity and sitting with their struggle rather than taking a win/lose approach.</li>\\n<li><strong>Become a problem solver.</strong> When conflict arises, approach the issue as a mutual problem to be solved together instead of as a disagreement in which one person is right and the other is wrong. Work together to find ways to meet everyone's needs.</li>\\n<li><strong>Reschedule when discussion becomes unproductive.</strong> Take a timeout when discussion begins to heat up and then return to the negotiating table when emotions have cooled.</li>\\n<li><strong>Take care of yourself.</strong> One of the burdens that your loved one with bipolar carries is seeing how miserable it makes you.
