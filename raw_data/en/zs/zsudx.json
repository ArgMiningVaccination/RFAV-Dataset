But do these last? Personal changes of this nature take both patience and persistence, but by adopting a holistic approach your resolutions can have more substance and staying power as they honour the close inter-relationship between your mind, body and soul. As Thomas Moore said, \"When the soul is neglected, it doesn't just go away; it appears in obsessions, addictions, violence, and loss of meaning.\" Eastern medicine is holistic in that it acknowledges not only our physical health, but accepts the significance of our mental and spiritual wellbeing, too. This was recognised in the Hippocratic doctrine, until it was superseded in the 17th century by our current \"analytical\" model that separates mind from body. Emotionally, we all suffer from worries about health, relationships, career, but controlling our thoughts can help reduce this anxiety. Affirmations are positive statements that retrain the subconscious mind to think in a more supportive way by helping counterbalance negative talk. There are numerous books available to help construct affirmations. Or simply try saying, \"With every breath I take, new life, health and energy enter into me. I am at peace\". To make affirmations potent, express them with belief and passion. As soon as a niggling negative sneaks into your mind, replace it with a positive and powerful affirmation. In the words of Nelson Mandela, \"We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be?\" Take a little time out to be alone. Like any other new routine, once you begin to enjoy time alone, to reflect, meditate, be creative, you will begin to appreciate and enjoy solitude. Create a sacred space in your home, a tranquil haven of peace, a special place for you to be alone. Play music that touches your soul, burn aromatherapy oils that instil a sense of wellbeing and let the soft glow of candles light the area. In 2002, make a commitment to put your mind in a completely relaxed state, even for five minutes a day, by meditating, visualising and creating your new future, for a new year is the chance to make a new start.
