This article is published with open Springerlink.com Keywords Epicutaneous allergen-specific T cell Opinion statement IgE-mediated allergies today affect up to 30 % of the population in industrialized countries. Allergen immunotherapy is the only disease-modify ing treatment option with a long-term effect. However, very few patients ( G5 %) choose immunotherapy, due to the long treatment duration (between 3 -5 years) and possible local and system- ic allergic side effects of the allergen administrations. The latter occur when an aller-gen accidentally reaches the blood circulation. Therefore, the ideal application route for allergen immunotherapy should be characterized by two hallmarks: firstly, by a high number of potent antigen-presenting cells, which enhance efficacy and thus shortentreatment duration. Secondly, the allerg en administration site is ideally non- vascularized, so that inadvertent system ic distribution of the allergen and conse- quent systemic allergic side effects are minimized. The epidermis contains high numbers of potent antigen-presenting Langerhans cells and, as an epithelium, isnon-vascularized. Therefore, the epidermis represents an interesting administrationroute. Historical evidence for the clinical efficacy of epicutaneous allergy immuno- therapy (EPIT) has now been strengthened by a number of recent double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trials perfo rmed by independent groups. We review the brought to you by CORE View metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk provided by Springer - Publisher Connectorimmunological rationale, history and clinical experience with epicutaneous allergy immunotherapy. Introduction With a current prevalence of up to 30 % in industrializedcountries, IgE-mediated allergies have become an impor-tant socioeconomic burden. Symptomatic treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids can efficiently ameliorate IgE-mediated symptoms [ 1], but does not stop progression of the underlying allergy. The only dis-ease-modifying treatment is allergen immunotherapy(AIT) [ 1,2]. Subcutaneous (SCIT) was more than a centuryago by Leonard Noon [ 3], but has two major disadvan- tages: it is time-consuming, as it requires 30 -70 visits to a medical practice, and subcutaneous allergen injec- tions are associated with local and systemic allergic sideeffects [ 4-6]. These two main drawbacks may potentially be resolved by the following strategies. First, to reduce the number of injections, immunoge- nicity of the allergen administration must be enhanced.This may theoretically be achieved (1) by increasing theallergen dose. While a dose effect in AIT is evident [ 7, 8], allergic side effects prohibit significant dose increases. Use of hypoallergenic allergens by chemical modificationto allergoids [ 9], by recombinant modification [ 10]o rb y using non -IgE-binding peptides [ 11,12,13\u0081\u0081], may per- mit increased allergen doses, but could reduce allergenimmunogenicity. A reduction of injection numbers mayalso be achieved (2) by replacing the classical adjuvant al-um, which is considered to actually favour a Th2 response, with a Th1-promoting adjuvant such as the Toll-like re- ceptor (TLR) [ 14\u0081] or MPLA [ 15-17]. The number of injections may also be reduced (3) by allergend e l i v e r yv i aar o u t ec h a r a c t e r i z e db yah i g hd e n s i t yo fa n -tigen-presenting cells. These are present at highest densityin secondary lymphatic orga ns such as lymph nodes, andindeed, when administered intralymphatically, the num- ber of allergen injections could be reduced to only three[18\u0081,19\u0081,20]. Second, to improve the safety of AIT, inadvertent al- lergen delivery to the blood vasculature must beavoided. Ideally, the allergen should be delivered to anon-vascularized tissue. In certain ways, sublingual al-lergy immunotherapy (SLIT) fu lfils this criterion, as the allergen is delivered to the oral mucosa, which iscovered by a multi-layered ep ithelium. Despite diffu- sion of the allergen down into deeper layers containing mast cells, which are responsible for the frequently ob- served local oral side effects [ 7,21], SLIT is considered very safe with respect to systemic allergic side effects[7,21]. Apparently, diffusion into a vascularized layer is less risky than injection into a vascularized layer. T h es a m es h o u l db et r u ef o re p i c u t a n e o u sa l l e r g yi m -munotherapy (EPIT), where an allergen is administeredto the non-vascularized epidermis. However, as an ad- vantage of EPIT over SLIT, keratinocytes can additional- ly be activated by physical irritation, e.g., abrasion oradhesive tape stripping, or by adding adjuvants [ 22]. Epithelial damage increases keratinocyte expression , IL-6 23]. Such activation of keratinocytes is impor- tant for creating a pro-inflammatory environment with enhanced activation of Langerhans cells. Hence, EPIT has the potential not only to reduce side effects by minimizin g allergen penetration to the vasculature, but also to shorten treatment durationby increasing immunogenicity of the administered al-lergen formulation. Potential application fields of EPIT Vaccination started with epicutaneous immunization, when Edward Jennerapplied cow pox virus to scarified human skin [ 24]. Having then been for- gotten for a long time, epicutaneous vaccination had its revival at the be-ginning of the twenty-first century, driven by the increasing interest in novelneedle-free vaccination routes [ 25,26]. Epicutaneous vaccination againstEpicutaneous Immunotherapy for and Food al. 69Escherichia coli -induced traveller 's diarrhoea [ 27\u0081\u0081] was the first step. Animal models have so far shown successful vaccination against infection withHelicobacter pylori [28], influenza virus [ 29] and diphtheria toxin [ 30]. The protective mechanism in all of these applications relies on induction ofhumoral immunity dominated by IgG1 and IgA. Studies testing epicutaneous vaccination against HIV also found induction of mucosal cytotoxic T cells together with secretion of mucosal antibodies [ 31]. Another field of appli- cation is cancer immunotherapy. Several groups achieved promising resultswith against skin cancer based on induction ofpotent +T cell responses [ 32,33]. Not only has EPIT been demonstrated to induce effector T cell responses, but also suppressive T cell responses whenEPIT was used to inhibit experimental allergic encephalomyelitis [ 34,35]. History of EPIT in allergy treatment EPIT as a treatment for allergies was introduced surprisingly early. In 1917, Besredka showed that EPIT was able to induce specific antibodies [ 36\u0081\u0081], and the first case study on successful epicutaneous allergy immunotherapy wasreported in 1921 by Vallery-Radot, who found that allergen administration onto scarified skin reduced systemic allergic symptoms in patients allergic to horses [ 37\u0081]. A decade later, when the risk of suffering a \"pollen shock \"during allergen immunotherapy was recognized to be a considerable danger of subcutane-ously administering allergen to highly on the observation that hay-fever patients occasion- ally experienced symptom amelioration after \"intradermal pollen tests \",E . W. Phillips started to treat highly sensitive patients as well as patients requesting co-seasonal treatment by administration of pollen extract [ 39]. Strikingly, such intradermal allergy immunotherapy proved to be both safeand highly efficacious, leading to symptom relief after administration of onlythree doses [ 39]. At the same time, M. A. Ramirez treated patients allergic to grass pollen with a method he called \"cuti-vaccination \", which consisted of administration of pollen extract onto scarified skin [ 36\u0081\u0081]. Based on these results, it was suggested in the 1930s that the subcutaneous route might not be optimal for administration of AIT: \"knowledge of the epidermis as an immunologic organ is still meager ...it may be theoretically possible that a more effective desensitization may be attained by this route than by thesubcutaneous one \"[38]. Between 1950 and 1960 French allergologists revisited EPIT [ 40,41]. Pautrizel administered the allergen extract onto slightly rubbed epidermis.Even though the reported results were excellent, a large number of applica-tions were necessary until symptom relief was observed [ 40]. Blamoutier, in contrast, applied the allergen drops onto heavily scarified skin [ 36\u0081\u0081,41]: \"On the proximal volar aspect of the lower arm, in a square area of 4\u00d74 cm, chessboard-like horizontal and vertical scratches are made with a needle....These scratches should be superficial and not cause bleeding \"[42]. Consis- tently, allergic side effects were observed only rarely when allergen was ap-70 Specific Immunotherapy (L Cox, Section Editor)plied via the skin, and if they occurred nevertheless, these reactions were always milder than under conventional SCIT [ 36\u0081\u0081,39-41]. These promising results were supported by several studies performed in the subsequent yearsall over Europe, from Switzerland [ 42,43] to Portugal [ 44]. Overall, symp- tom relief was obtained rapidly and allowed for co-seasonal treatment. The reported treatment success rates of 80 % exceeded the success rates under conventional SCIT [ 42]. Despite such successful results with the French m\u00e9thode de quadrillage cutan\u00e9 , reports on this promising administration route disappeared into oblivion for almost half a century. EPIT for aeroallegens While there is strong scientific and hi storical evidence for EPIT in allergy treatment, no double-blind placebo-co ntrolled clinical trials existed, a f a c tt h a tl e do u rg r o u pt or e v i s i t EPIT. Driven by the idea to find a patient-convenient application rou te of AIT in order to increase its at- tractiveness, and based on the good accessibility of the skin and its highdensity of potent immune cells, our gr oup performed three clinical trials to test efficacy and safety of EPIT. In order to keep epithelial barrier disruption minimal, we replaced skin scarification by adhesive tape stripping [ 45]. Besides enhancing the penetration of allergens by re- moving stratum corneum [46], repeated tape stripping also functions as a \"physical \"adjuvant through activation of k eratinocytes, which then and of DCs to the draining lymph nodes [ 47,48] .R e s u l t so ft h ef i r s tp i l o tt r i a lr e v e a l e dt h a tp a t i e n t s treated with a total of 12 patches containing pollen extract experienced significant alleviation of hay fever symptoms compared to placebo- treated patients. In line with the \"historical \"study results described above, no severe systemic allergic reactions were reported. The only ad-verse events observed were very mild local eczematous reactions under the skin patch [ 45]. When looking at all 12 patch applications, mild eczema was observed in 15 out of the 21 verum patients, whereas sucheczema was only seen in 5 out of the 15 placebo patients. When lookingat a single patch application, ecze ma under the patch, with a severity score between 3 and 6 on a scale ranging from 0 to 18, was observed in roughly half of the verum patients. In order to exclude partialunblinding of the study by the occurrence of local adverse effects, wehad analysed whether or not the occurrence of eczema under the patchcorrelated with symptom amelioration, but we could not find such acorrelation. Encouraged by these resu lts, a second phase I/IIa trial in- cluding a total of 132 grass pollen -allergic patients was initiated to find the optimal treatment dose of EPIT. Enrolled patients were treated co- seasonally with a total of six patches. We found a clear relationship between the administered allergen do se and the clinical effect, with the highest allergen dose leading to the most marked symptom improvement [49\u0081]. Also, we found a dose-dependence of the local adverse effects where patches were applied, with pruritus being the most frequentlyEpicutaneous Immunotherapy for Aeroallergen and Food Allergy Senti et al. 71reported adverse event, followed b y eczema observed after patch re- moval. Interestingly, wit h every subsequent patch application, there was a reduction of local adverse events. After the sixth patch application,only half as many local adverse events were reported. This reduction wasnot explicable by local depletion of immune cells or degranulation of mast cells, as each of the six patches was applied to a different area of the arm. Therefore, the reduction of local adverse events is likely to be explained by tolerance induction. A t hird clinical trial investigated the immunological changes induced during EPIT and found an increase inallergen-specific IgG4 [ 50]. Our results have meanwhile been confirmed by an independent group that demonstrated efficacy and safety of EPITin grass pollen -allergic children. Hay fever symptoms, as well as the use of antihistamines, were significant ly reduced in the active treatment group [ 51\u0081]. Also, the results of intradermal allergy immunotherapy reported by W. Philipp back in 1926 have meanwhile been indirectly confirmed in a dou-ble-blind placebo-controlled trial by Rotiroti et al. [ 52\u0081\u0081]. They found that six low-dose intradermal injections with grass pollen extract, i.e., only 7 ng ofPhl p 5 per injection, strongly reduced the allergen-induced cutaneous lateresponse. So far, there is no head-to-head comparison of EPIT to other routes of administration, except in mouse models. Using the major grass pollen allergen Phl p 5, EPIT was found in the mouse to be at least equivalent toSLIT [ 53]. While EPIT and SLIT induced similar IgG2a levels and also led to a similar reduction in IgE levels in sensitized mice, it was only EPITthat led could significantly reduce eosinophil counts in the bronchoalve-olar lavage (BAL) in the asthma model. Also in mice, we have comparedSCIT with EPIT using ovalbumin as the allergen. ad-juvant was less immunogenic than SCIT, EPIT with an adjuvant was found to be more immunogenic, so that EPIT and SCIT appeared comparable in efficacy [ 22]. EPIT for food allergens A clinical pilot trial to test clinical efficacy and safety of EPIT using the Viaskin\u00ae EDS in children suffering from cow 's milk allergy showed a ten- dency toward an increased cumulative tolerance dose after a three-monthtreatment period, but missed statistical significance. Treatment was welltolerated, with no systemic anaphylactic reactions, but a significant increaseof local eczematous skin reactions was observed [ 54\u0081\u0081]. Such good safety results are crucial, especially when considering the use of EPIT as treatmentoption for food allergies for which conventional SCIT is impractical due toan unacceptably high rate of anaphylactic reactions [ 55]. To substantiate these early findings, and aiming to de velop a definitive therapeutic op- tion for food allergy patients, a phase I (NCT01170286) as well as aphase II trial (NCT01197053) have rece ntly been initiated with the ob- jective to test treatment efficacy of EPIT with the Viaskin\u00ae EDS in peanutallergy patients.72 Specific Immunotherapy (L Cox, Section Editor)Outlook As there now exist several placebo-co ntrolled double-blind clinical trials confirming the efficacy of EPIT in allergy treatment [ 45,49\u0081,51\u0081,52\u0081\u0081, 56], there remains little doubt that th is method works in principle. Our clinical trial program has also shown that the allergen dose is an im-portant efficacy parameter [ 49\u0081]. The allergen dose used in skin patches cannot readily be increased any further. We had already used 30 go f major grass pollen allergen Phl p 1, corresponding to 1 ml of the tenfoldconcentration that is used for the ski n prick solution. A higher concen- tration would not only generate consi derable cost of materials, but ap- plication to any accidentally impaired skin barrier would increase the risk for systemic allergic effects. Fu ture research should therefore focus on enhancing penetration of the str atum corneum into the viable layers of the skin where Langerhans cells re side, and also on adjuvants suitable for epicutaneous administration. Methods for enhancing penetration across the skin barrier include (1) hydration of the stratum corneum, which facilitates diffusion of hydro- philic molecules. Any form of occl usion, such as the patches we [ 45, 49\u0081]a n do t h e r s[ 51\u0081] have used, hydrates the skin by accumulation of sweat [ 54\u0081\u0081,57]. Also, a French group recently developed an alternative form of EPIT based on allergen deliv ery to the intact skin using an oc- clusive epidermal delivery system (Viaskin\u00ae EDS) [ 54\u0081\u0081,57,58]. Initially developed for diagnostic purposes as an alternative system to the con-ventional Finn chamber used in atopy patch test [ 59], Viaskin\u00ae relies on the ability to deliver whole protein molecules to the skin [ 57,58]. Perspiration generated under an occlusive chamber dissolves thelyophilised allergen loaded on the Viaskin\u00ae EDS [ 57,58]. De- livered via such EDS, proteins have been demonstrated to accumulate in the stratum corneum, where they effic iently targets immune cells of the superficial skin layer [ 60] that rapidly migrate to the draining lymph nodes [ 57]. In murine studies, EPIT using the Viaskin\u00ae EDS showed ef- ficacy equivalent to SCIT in prevent ing allergic airway reactions upon inhalative allergen challenge [ 57]. Skin penetration may also be en- hanced (2) by adding so called penetration enhancers, such as salicylicacid (used by Agostinis et al. [51]) or (3) by packing the antigen intolipid based colloidal systems [ 61]. Last but not least, skin penetration can be enhanced (4) by microporation, either using a microneedle patch[29,62]o raL A S E R[ 63 \u0081,64]. While all the above methods enhance skin penetration of allergens, it remains to be seen to which degree each of these methods also activatekeratinocytes, which importantly in teract with Langerhans cells. It may be speculated that the different outcomes of the above methods, e.g., therelative inefficacy of the Viaskin\u00ae chamber, may well be explained by theassumption that hydration alone doe s not activate keratinocytes as much as tape stripping or abrasion. In fact, a heavily disrupted skin barrier has been observed to polarize the immune response toward Th1, whereas slight skin barrier disruption rather induces a non-inflammatory Th2/Epicutaneous Immunotherapy for Aeroallergen and Food Allergy Senti et al. 73Treg-dominated response [ 23] .T h ee v i d e n c ei nt h i sa r e ai sc o n f l i c t i n g ,a s Mondoulet et al., in their mouse models of peanut allergy, find intactskin and un-stripped skin to be crucial for efficacy and safety of im-munotherapy [ 65]. In contrast, our mouse models using OVA find no therapeutic effect if the skin was not tape stripped before allergen ap- plication [ 22]. Adjuvants in EPIT represent another strategy to enhance efficacy. Al- um is the adjuvant used in the majority of marketed vaccines today[66]; however, it is not suitable for epicutaneous administration [ 67]. Thus far, cholera toxin (CT) and hea t-labile enterotoxin (LT) have been successfully used as adjuvants in epicutaneous vaccination against in-fectious diseases of mice and humans [ 27\u0081\u0081,67,68]. On the other hand, imidazoquinolines (TLR7 or -8 li gands) and CpG (TLR9 ligands) are currently being tested as adjuvants for epicutane ous vaccination against cancer [ 33,69]. Our group recently tested the immune-enhancing and immune-modulatory potential of diphenylcyclopropenone when used asadjuvant in EPIT [ 22]. Conclusion In light of the increasing prevalence of allergic disease [ 70,71], which strongly contrasts with the low percentage of patients choosing SCIT [ 4,7], research during the next century should aim at optimization of current AIT methods inorder to increase its attractiveness. Optimization of allergen immunotherapyshould (1) deliver the allergen via a route that efficiently targets professionalAPCs, (2) use optimal adjuvants, (3) avoid allergen delivery to highlyvascularized sites as to minimize systemic allergic side effects, and (4) be con-venient for the patient, i.e., self-administrable and painless. Epicutaneous allergyimmunotherapy holds promise in all four aspects: (1) the epidermis contains a high number of potent APCs, (2) adjuvants can be topically administered and/ or physical or chemical trauma to keratinocytes may already act as an \"physical adjuvant \", (3) the epidermis is non-vascularized, and (4) epicutaneous ad- ministration can be done at home and is painless. Being afraid of needles, children w ould especially benefit most from a needle-free form of AIT [ 72], as AIT early in the course of allergic dis- eases has the potential to stop dise ase progression to asthma, which represents a considerable health burden. Such reasoning might highlight the development of a preventive, needle-free, patch-based allergy vaccine, accepted as a part of the WHO recommended \"early childhood \"vacci- nation program, to conquer the epidemic of the twenty-first century.
