At the fall 2019 meeting, NOSB will vote on whether the substances should continue to be listed or should be removed from the list. Now is your chance to provide feedback. See the 2021 Sunset Review section below for details, and weigh in using our sunset surveys ! CROPS SUBCOMMITTEE Fatty Alcohol (Petition) - Proposal BACKGROUND: Fatty alcohol is petitioned for use as sucker control on organic tobacco crops. The substance is produced fro m natural fats or petroleum sources, requiring chemical changes to produce the final product. Fatty alcohol is applied as a broadcast spray over to p of tobacco plants in the early flower stage when suckers ( auxiliary lateral buds ) are tender , desiccating the sucker. Sucker control reduces drain on plant resources, and supports growth and yield of marketable tobacco leaves. This is the second time that NOSB is reviewing this substance. The first petition was for a much broader use of the substance in tobacco and other crops , and did not specify the range of fatty alcohols . NOSB rejected (Fall 2017) the original petition, citing among other issues that the use of a synthetic growth regulator is not compatible with a system of sustainable and organic agriculture. The revised petition on the current meeting agenda is limited only to use on tobacco , and is limited only to the active ingredient C6, C8, C10, C12 naturally derived fatty alcohol . SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL: The majority opinion of the subcommittee is to accept the petition and allow fatty alcohols for tobacco sucker control because of the l imited scope of the petition and the essentiality of the substance for production of tobacco crops . Numerous public comments from tobacco growers indicate that this substance is essential f or tobacco production because alternative substances and practices are not effective. Manual suckering exposes field workers to potential health issues such as tobacco poisoning from skin contact with tobacco leaves . Fatty alcohol is rapidly biodegradable and poses low concern for environmental contamination. The subcommittee proposal also includes a minority opinion that does not support the petition because labor savings and greater economic returns are insufficient criteria for allowing a synthetic material in organic production. SUBCOMMITTEE VOTE: Motion to ad d fatty alcohols C6, C8, C10, C12 Naturally Derived Fatty Alcohol at \u00a7205.601 for sucker control on organic tobacco crops. PASSED ( Yes: 4 No: 2 Abstain: 1 Absent: (Petition) - Proposal BACKGROUND: Potassium hypochlorite is petitioned for use an irrigation water treatment under the same conditions as other chlorine materials on the National List: \" For pre -harvest use, residual chlorine levels in the water in direct crop contact or as water from cleaning irrigation systems applied to soil must not exceed the maximum residual disinfectant limit under the Safe Drinking Water Act, except that chlorine products may be used in edible sprout production according to EPA label directions.\" Potassium hypochlorite is produced by reac ting chlorine with an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide. SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL: The subcommittee proposes to accept the petition for potassium hypochlorite because its chemistry and human and environmental risk are nearly identical to currently 3 allow ed chlorine materials sodium and calcium hypochlorite. SUBCOMMITTEE VOTE: Motion to add potassium hypochlorite at \u00a7205.601(a)(2): Chlorine materials --For use in water for irrigation purposes, residual chlorine levels in the water in direct crop contact or as water from cleaning irrigation systems applied to soil must not exceed the maximum residual disinfectant limit under the Safe Drinking Water Act . PASSED ( Yes: 7 No: 0 Abstain: 0 Absent: 1 Recuse: 0 ) Paper (Plant Pots and Other Crop Production Aids) (Petition) - Discussion Document BACKGROUND: Paper planting pots have been petitioned by Small Farm Works for inclusion on the National List. Paper pots and other growing containers are used as a vessel for growing transplants intended to be planted directly in the ground. Nitten paper chain systems, which are the subject of the petition, are used to facilitate transplanting closely spaced crops such as onions, salad greens, herbs, and others crops. In addition to paper, the products are formulated with several adhesives. Newspapers and other recycled papers are already allowed as synthetic substances for use as mulch and as a compost feedstock. Certifiers have historically extended the allowance for paper to its use in transplant pots, even though paper isn't specifically on the National List for this use. This petition was submitted for NOSB to specifically address the use of paper as a production aid for transplants intended to be planted into soil. At the f all 2018 meeting, NOSB presented a discussion document to solicit public comments on the neces sity and environmental impact of the material and the availability of alternatives. At the spring 2019 meeting, NOSB presented a discussion document that expanded the scope of its review to include a variety of paper -based production aids including pots, s eed tape, collars, and hot caps. Out of concern for the use of synthetic fibers in paper -based planting aids, NOSB requested a technical report to evaluate the types of synthetic fibers and the biodegradability of the synthetic fibers used in these types of products. The technical report clarified that synthetic fibers in paper pots and containers are also found in other paper materials currently allowed in organic production as mulches and compost feedstock s. SUBCOMMITTEE DISCUSSION DOCUMENT: The subcommittee sees few differences between the current paper allowances and the petitioned paper pots and other paper- based planting aids, and has developed a listing and annotation for the possible allowance of paper pots and other production aids. Public comments are requested on the following discussion questions. Discussion Questions: 1. Please comment on the following options under consideration by the subcommittee for listing at \u00a7205.601(o) as production aids: a. \"Virgin or recycled paper, without color ed or glossy inks,\" or b. \"Virgin or recycled paper, without colored or glossy inks; any synthetic polymer fibers included must not exceed 15% of the paper and must be 100% bio -based with content determined using ASTM D6866 (incorporated by reference; see 20 5.3), and demonstrates at least 90% biodegradation absolute or relative to microcrystalline cellulose in less than two years, in soil, according to one of the following test methods: ISO 17556 or ASTM D5988 (both incorporated by reference; see \u00a7205.3 )\" 2. Synthetic polymer content \u2014 a. Should a maximum synthetic polymer content be stated explicitly? If so, what is the appropriate level? b. What is the amount (or range) of synthetic polymer content in products currently available? c. How would synthetic content be measured? How would a certifier or Material Review Organization verify content? For example, if a product included recycled paper as an ingredient, how would the synthetic polymer content be determined? 4 d. Is it possible to manufacture paper production aids th at use only natural fiber sources and that meet the product specifications for their intended use? 3. Biodegradability \u2014 a. Should a biodegradability standard be included for these products? If so, is this the appropriate biodegradability standard? b. Does maximum synthetic polymer content need to be stated if there is a biodegradability requirement? c. As the products biodegrade, what is the impact on the soil? Also, can fragments be consumed by wildlife or livestock before it is completely degraded? 4. Bio-based content \u2014 a. Should a minimum bio -based content standard be included for these products? b. Is 100% bio -based content achievable for these products? If not, what should be the minimum bio -based content requirement? 5. Is genetic engineering involved in the production of these products? 6. Does the annotation need to specify that added fungicides, insecticides, or other synthetic materials not typically found in paper would not be allowed, or is that already understood? SUBCOMMITTEE VOTE: Motion to accept the discussion document. DISCUSSION ONLY (Yes: 8 No: 0 Abstain: 0 Absent: 0 Recuse: 0) MATERIALS SUBCOMMITTEE Excluded Methods: Induced mutagenesis and embryo transfer in livestock - Proposal BACKGROUND: NOSB is addressing two items related to excluded methods : 1) induced mutagenesis, and 2) embryo transfer in livestock. These items represent a continuation of work by NOSB over the past few years. On November 18, 2016, NOSB passed a recommendation on Excluded Methods Terminology that provided a new framework of definitions for determining a genetic manipulation as an excluded method and requested that NOP incorporate the information into a guidance document. This recommendation provided improved definitions and att empts to address the increased diversity in types of genetic manipulations performed on seed, livestock and other inputs used in agriculture. It is understood that genetic engineering is a rapidly expanding field in science at this time, and that NOSB and NOP will need to continually review new technologies to determine if they would or would not be acceptable in organic agriculture. Also in November 2016, NOSB presented a discussion document with a running list of new technologies under review to determine if they are within the definition of excluded methods and thus prohibited. Several of the technologies in the document are identified as \"to be determined,\" with the understanding that NOSB will continue to resolve these issues at future meetings. SUBCO MMITTEE PROPOSAL : The subcommittee has presented a proposal on two technologies that are currently \"to be determined\" in the November 2016 discussion document described above : 1) Induced mutagenesis, and 2) Embryo transfer in livestock . Induced Mutagenesis : The subcommittee proposes that induced mutagenesis developed through in vitro nucleic acid techniques meets the criteria to be determined as an excluded method and should be identified as such in NOP Guidance on Excluded Methods . Other methods of induced mutagenesis need further discussion, so the subcommittee proposes that induced mutagenesis developed through exposure to UV light, chemicals, irradiation, or other stress -causing activities remain as \"t o be determined.\" 5 Embryo Transfer in Livestock : The subcommittee proposes that embryo transfer (or embryo rescue) in livestock is not an excluded method and should be identified as \"not excluded\" in NOP Guidance on Excluded Methods. Use of hormones is not allowed in recipient animals. SUBCOMMITTEE VOTE: Motion to accept the proposal on excluded methods determinations. PASSED (Yes: 5 No: 0 Abstain: 0 Absent: 0 Recuse: 0) Genetic Integrity Transparency of Seed Grown on Organic Land - Instructions to Certifiers - Proposal BACKGROUND: Since 2012, NOSB has issued several discussion documents on the topic of \"seed purity\" (i.e., keeping seed stock used for organic production free from conta mination by GMOs via a seed purity standard). Public commenters have expressed strong support for exploring the feasibility of a seed purity standard recognizing the importance of reducing inadvertent introduction of GMOs into crops through seeds. At the same time, there is concern that setting a standard without the proper infrastructure may penalize famers for trespass of genetic contamination that is the fault of others. It could also ultimately narrow the availability of needed crops traits. Six years o f discussion and public comment led to a conclusion that public data on seed contamination is needed to inform an effective and fair seed purity standard if one is to be established. NOSB continues to explore solution s to this complex problem . SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL : The subcommittee proposes that NOP provide an \"Instruction to Certifiers\" that encourage s certifiers and farmers to be proactive in obtaining information about GE contamination before planting seed that has a GE equivalent . There is no specific requirement, other than for certifiers to instruct their clients about the option to request GE contamination test results from their seed and planting stock providers. The proposal does not set tolerance levels that could prohibit planting of seed that exceeds any specific tolerance. To aid producers in their goal of low -to-no detection of GE contamination of their organic crops (seed and planting stock) that have GE equivalents in the marketplace, certifiers should provide the follo wing information to their organic farmers: A. Producers who are growing crops from seed or planting stock that could be subject to Genetic Engineering contamination of that seed or planting stock can contact their suppliers to obtain GE contamination tes t results. B. The vast majority of seed and planting stock suppliers whose crops have GE equivalent varieties that could cause contamination are already doing GE contamination testing and are supplying information , at the request of the buyer of their seed or planting stock, of any GE contamination and the levels present. C. Certifiers may choose to obtain this information at the organic inspection. If presence of GE contamination is found on the finished crop by t he certifier in their testing program or by a buyer of the finished crop, this seed GE contamination information will be useful in determining the cause of the GE contamination. D. Certifiers can inform farmers who wish to test seed they grew or test seed or planting stock they purchased, that they are legally allowed to test for GE contamination. A wide variety of laboratories around the U.S. and the world supply this testing service. This information could be provided to the organic certifier as well. SUBCOMMITTEE VOTE: Motion to accept the \"Genetic Integrity Transparency of Seed Grown on Organic Land Instructions to Certifiers\" Proposal. PASSED (Yes: 5 No: 0 Abstain: 0 Absent: 0 Recuse: 0 6 NOSB Research Priorities 2019 - Proposal BACKGROUND: Since adopting its Research Priorities Framework in 2012, NOSB has presented an annual list of research priorities for organic food and agriculture. The priorities are proposed by NOSB's Livestock, Crops, Handling, and Materials/GMO Subcommittees. SUBCOMMITTEE P ROPOSAL: NOSB encourages integrated, whole farm research in to the following areas: Livestock 1. Evaluation of methionine in the context of a system approach in organic poultry production. 2. Prevention and management of parasites, examining breeds, geographical differences, alternative treatments, and pasture species. 3. Organic livestock breeding for animals adapted to outdoor life and living vegetation. Crops 1. Examination of decomposition rates, the effects of residues on soil biolog y, and the factors that affect the breakdown of biodegradable bio -based mulch film. 2.

SUBCOMMITTEE VOTE: Motion to adopt the proposal on 2019 NOSB Research Priorities. PASSED (Yes: 5 No: 0 Abstain: 0 Absent: 0 Recuse: 0) Marine materials in organic crop production - Discussion Document BACKGROUND: Marine vegetation such as seaweeds are commonly used in the manufacture of crop production inputs such as fertilizers and soil conditioners. These marine materials are largely harvested from wild native ecosystems. During the 2015 Sunset Review of the \u00a7205.601(j) listing of aquatic plant extracts, concerns were raised about the increase in global harvesting of seaweeds and the accelerated poten tial for destruction of marine ecosystems. To more fully examine marine materials in organic production, a Technical Report was obtained in 2016. A discussion document was posted for the fall 2016 NOSB meeting that posed questions about the naming conventi ons of marine plant/algae on the National List, the need to specify uses or harvesting guidelines of certain species, and whether further NOP guidance is needed. In spring 2017, NOSB proposed a motion to limit the \u00a7205.601(j) listing of aquatic plant extracts to only brown seaweeds. Public comments revealed that aquatic plant input products also use green and red algae, so the proposal was sent back to subcommittee to re -examine its approach to the issue . Another discussion document was posted for the fall 2018 meeting that explored a potential requirement for marine plants to be certified organic when used in crop inputs, and it initiated a robust response from public commenters. Although there was unanimous support throughout the comments that the issue o f sustainability in marine plant harvesting should be addressed, there was not consensus that organic certification was necessarily the right solution based on the information available at the time. NOSB continues to seek an effective and realistic means of addressing this complicated issue of ensuring that marine algae harvesting maintains or improves the environment. SUBCOMMITTEE DISCUSSION DOCUMENT: The discussion document on Marine Materials in Organic Crop Production was presented at the April 2019 NOSB meeting, and is being posted a second time for additional comment. It is identical to the April 2019 version with the exception of the addition of question #8. The discussion document presents the approach of requiring organic certification of marine algae ingredient s in crop inputs (proposed language changes are underlined): o \u00a7205.601 (j) As plant or soil amendments. (1) Aquatic plant extracts (other than hydrolyzed) -Extraction process is limited to the u se of potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide; solvent amount use is limited to that amount necessary for extraction. Marine algae ingredients must be certified organic. o \u00a7205.602 Non -synthetic substances prohibited for use in organic crop production. (j) Marine algae -- unless certified organic. The discussion document summarize s and attempt s to address the concerns raised at the last meeting about this approach, specifically regarding the authority of NOSB to require organic inputs, and the effectiveness of organic certification to meet sustainability goals. The document also summarizes a number of a lternative approaches suggested in the last meeting. Those approaches include: limiting or prohibiting harvest of certain marine algae ; exploring other existing third -party standards for sustainable harvesting ; or adding annotations to material listings on the National List to require sustainable harvesting . Each of these approaches is met with its own set of questions and concerns outlined in the document. The discussion document also puts forth additional discussion questions for 8 stakeholder feedback. NOSB plans to utilize public comment to develop a proposal at the fall 2019 meeting. Discussion Questions: 1. If you are n ot in support of requiring organic certification, what approach do you support? Please describe the method for defining, measuring, and most importantly, enforcing, that the harvest would not be destructive to the environment under an alternative approach. 2. Some existing wild harvest marine algae standards from other certifiers and third -party entities are listed in the Appendix. Please comment on strengths in these standards that could be adapted for NOP guidance. Please identify areas of weakness or areas that are not covered. 3. What existing certification or private standards to support marine algae harvest sustainability have not been included in this document or the Appendix that can help inform NOSB's understanding of the current work being done? 4. How many crop input products approved for use in organic production currently contain certified organic marine algae ingredients? 5. Are there any crop input products utilizing or developing farmed marine algae? 6. Are there enough certifiers able to offer certi fication services to meet the needs of the crop fertilizer markets if organic certification were required? If organic certification were required of marine algae ingredients, what would be an appropriate phase -in time to allow markets to meet the demand? 7. NOSB hopes to convene an expert panel at the f all 2019 board meeting to include a marine algae harvester for crop inputs, scientist, conservationist, and certifier, among others. What are some questions that could be posed to help identify the issues and solutions? 8. What are the standards for evaluating environmental harm? For example, what measures of community biodiversity and marine algae species characteristics (density, maximum height, girth, area) could be collected pre - and post -harvest? How soo n must these variables return to baseline to avoid environmental harm? SUBCOMMITTEE VOTE: Motion to accept the discussion document. DISCUSSION ONLY (Yes: 5 No: 0 Abstain: 0 Absent: 0 Recuse: 0) POLICY DEVELOPMENT SUBCOMMITTEE Updates to the policy and procedures manual - Discussion Document BACKGROUND: The Policy and Procedures Manual (PPM) was established to assist NOSB in the implementation of its duties under the Organic Foods Production Act and to establish operating procedures and policies for NOSB.

PASSED (Yes: 5 No: 0 Abstain: 0 Absent: 1 Recuse: 0) LIVESTOCK SUBCOMMITTEE Use of excluded methods vaccines in organic livestock production - Proposal BACKGROUND: Vaccines are permitted as a preven tive health care material in organic livestock production. Uncertainty has exist ed about the status of vaccines made from excluded methods (i.e. genetic engineering) that are permitted, which has caused inconsistencies between certifiers in what vaccines are allowed to be used in organic livestock production. Although \u00a7205.105(e) requir es excluded method vaccines to be reviewed and placed on the National List before use and there is a categorical listing for vaccines on the National List, there are not individual vaccine listings nor a specific references to those from excluded methods. This topic was discussed in depth by NOSB from 2009- 2014, culminating in a unanimous recommendation from NOSB in fall 2014 that presented findings on manufacturing and availability of vaccines made with excluded methods, and requested that NOP review the information and provide guidance to the industry on these materials. NOP has not been able to act on t his recommendation because of the following challenges: \"having an updated definition of excluded methods that determines if new technologies were to be excluded methods for organic, having a clear understanding if there were non -excluded method vaccine eq uivalents to excluded method derived vaccines and how to provide for use of excluded method vaccines if there was an emergency when only an excluded method vaccine could address the problem in a timely way.\" NOSB's more recent work on excluded methods term inology will support the renewed focus of the Livestock Subcommittee's work on vaccines. At the spring 2019 meeting, NOSB presented a discussion document with three options to clarifying the allowance of excluded methods vaccines in the regulations: 1) Follow the requirements of \u00a7205.105 (e) and start reviewing known excluded method vaccines for individual placement on the National List ; 2) Allow all vaccines \"as a class\" without any review or consideration if they were produced through excluded methods ; 3) Allow vaccines from excluded methods, but only if a vaccine is not \"commercially available\" that had not been produced from excluded methods to effe ctively treat that health issue. Most public commenters supported option 3. At the fall 2019 meeting, N OSB presents a proposal to implement that option. SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL : The subcommittee proposes to amend NOP regulations so that vaccines from excluded methods may be used when an equivalent vaccine not produced through excluded methods is not commercially available. This proposal implements the most popular of the three options presented for discussion at the meeting last spring. The subcommittee's proposal includes information about how to determine commercial availability of a vaccine not pro duced through excluded method terminology. SUBCOMMITTEE VOTE: Motion to change th e USDA organic regulations at \u00a7 205.105 (e). Addition to the current rule noted in bold. 10 (e) Excluded methods, except for vaccines: Provided, That vaccines produced through excluded methods may be used when an equivalent vaccine not produced through excluded methods is not commercially available. PASSED (Yes: 5 No: 0 Abstain: 0 Absent: 1 Recuse: 0) (Petition) - Discussion Document BACKGROUND: Fenbendazole is a parasiticide that has been petitioned for use in laying hens and replacement chickens intended to become laying hens. Birds that receive outdoor access and have contact with soil are more likely to come in contact with internal parasites. In poultry produc tion, t he substances is administered orally via drinking water and is effective in controlling internal parasites such as A. galli and H. gallinarum . If permitted in organic production, fenbendazole would only be allowed for emergency treatment when preven tive management practices do not prevent infestation. Fenbendazole is currently allowed in organic production for emergency treatment for dairy and breeder stock and fiber- bearing animals under the restrictions at \u00a7205.603( a)(23) . SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL: The subcommittee is considering this petition and poses the questions listed below to the public for comment. The subcommittee does not intend to specify a withdrawal time for use on poultry because the FDA data shows that total residues of fenbendazole in eggs of treated chickens at zero -day withdrawal are well below the safe concentration of 2.4 ppm for residues in eggs . Discussion Questions: 1. Is this material needed by organic poultry producers? If so, why? 2. Do currently allowed alternatives work to contro l internal parasites? And at what level of effectiveness? 3. What are some of the \"emergency\" events that would trigger use of this product? And how would producers determine those events? 4. Is there a concern with the 2.4 ppm residue of fenbendazole in eggs? P lease submit information that supports this concern, or lack of concern. SUBCOMMITTEE VOTE: Motion to accept the discussion document. DISCUSSION ONLY (Yes: 6 No: 0 Abstain: 0 Absent: 1 Recuse: 0) 2021 SUNSET MATERIALS BACKGROUND: This fall, the NOSB will vote on whether to continue the allowance of several of the fertilizers, pest control products, livestock treatments, processing aids, and ingredients currently included on the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances to determine whether t he substances should continue to be listed or should be removed from the list.
