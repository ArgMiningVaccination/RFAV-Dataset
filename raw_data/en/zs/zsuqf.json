Applications of interest include those that refine and test scalable strategies for use in primary care across different intercepts in the chain-of-care, including strategies for identifying individuals at risk, assessing and stratifying risk, providing brief interventions, promoting initial and ongoing engagement in indicated services, continued outcome monitoring and follow-up, and tracking patient outcomes. For purposes of this FOA, primary care is defined as pediatric practice, family practice, obstetrics/gynecology, internal medicine, and geriatric practice. Primary care practices range in size, resources and patient health needs; proposed strategies should meet the practice needs to be feasible, scalable, sustainable, and practice-ready. NIMH encourages prevention approaches that incorporate the use of mHealth (the use of mobile and wireless devices [cell phones, tablets, etc.]) and other design features that can facilitate scalability and sustainability, and deployment-focused research approaches that take into account the perspectives of key stakeholders (e.g., patients, providers, administrators) and system-level factors such as setting resources, workforce capacity, and training needs. This FOA also encourages studies that examine suicide prevention strategies that have broad reach, including potential for addressing risk among individuals who experience mental health service disparities (e.g., racial/ethnic minority groups; sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural areas, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons), and studies that explore how the proposed strategies can reduce health disparities and promote health equity. 30 days prior to the application due date.

Conformance to all requirements (both in the Application Guide and the FOA) is required and strictly enforced. Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in [Section IV](#_Section_IV._Application_1). When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions. Applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review. Rationale NIMH, as a federal partner of the [National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention](https://theactionalliance.org/about-us), seeks to reduce suicide by building evidence-based suicide prevention in healthcare systems. Previous research has found that over 90% of suicide decedents accessed care within the 12 months of their death, and they averaged 17 healthcare visits during the year. Nearly a third of individuals had a healthcare visit in the 7-days before suicide. Within that week, nearly 1 in 10 had been seen in primary care. These data suggest healthcare visits, and in particular, a healthcare visit in primary care, offer crucially important opportunities to identify and intervene with at-risk individuals. This FOA is consistent with [NIMH Strategic Research Objective 4.2.B](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/goal-4-strengthen-the-public-health-impact-of-nimh-supported-research), which calls for practice-based research partnerships in health care systems, and addresses the 'practice-to-science' needs identified by the [National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention](https://theactionalliance.org/healthcare). This FOA also speaks to objectives in the [Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention](https://theactionalliance.org/resource/prioritized-research-agenda-suicide-prevention-action-plan-save-lives) that focus on increasing the effectiveness of suicide risk detection and screening, and interventions and services, and is relevant to questions posed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) regarding the risks and benefits of suicide risk screening in primary care for [children, adolescents](https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/document/final-research-plan/screening-depression-anxiety-suicide-risk-children-adolescents), and [adults (including perinatal women](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/draft-update-summary/screening-depression-anxiety-suicide-risk-adults). Improving suicide prevention services in primary care is also essential to overall healthcare system safe and effective suicide care capabilities. Beyond screening and initial identification of at-risk individuals, depending on the goals and the capacity within the setting, primary care can potentially play a role in advancing suicide prevention at additional intercepts in the chain of care, including stratifying risk through additional assessment, delivering brief interventions, promoting initial and ongoing engagement in appropriate services, and determining the benefit of services and need for additional services through ongoing measurement of patient outcomes. Systems-level improvements, such as collaborative care for depression, have repeatedly resulted in lower suicide ideation in primary care. Moreover, large health care organizations, like the [Veterans Health Administration](https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/MH/srb/), have identified evidence-based, multi-tiered suicide prevention approaches across healthcare settings. Resources for best practices that can be used to help achieve goals relevant to [Zero Suicide](https://www.sprc.org/zero-suicide) \u2014 a commitment to suicide reduction strategies in healthcare settings \u2014 have been developed, including approaches to measurement-based primary care and [sample clinical workflows](https://zerosuicide.edc.org/resources/settings/integrated-primary-care-and-behavioral-health). Given the diversity of primary care settings, additional research is needed to test existing strategies, and/or develop new strategies for implementing measurement-based care for suicide prevention. Research Scope and Objectives This FOA encourages research focused on refining and pilot testing scalable strategies for suicide prevention in primary care across different intercepts in the chain-of-care, including strategies for: identifying individuals at risk; assessing and stratifying risk; providing brief interventions; promoting initial and facilitating ongoing engagement in indicated services, continued outcome monitoring and follow-up, and tracking of patient outcomes. Applications can address multi-component clinical workflows (the delivery of clinical services as a series of tasks, in what order, by whom, and how) and/or optimize and test specific components that will advance practice effectiveness and efficiency. For purposes of this FOA, primary care is defined as pediatric practice, family practice, obstetrics/gynecology, internal medicine, and geriatric practice. The pathway to effective suicide prevention in primary care is multilevel and complex. It can include multiple types of providers within and beyond the primary care setting, and it requires buy-in from practice leadership that supports suicide prevention infrastructure, including provisions for monitoring and feedback systems to ensure practices are effective and support for suicide prevention training for providers and other staff. Moreover, comprehensive suicide prevention is typically comprised of multicomponent workflows that include screening, brief interventions for immediate safety needs (e.g., safety planning; means safety counseling) and/or for prevention; processes for obtaining behavioral health consultations (in person or telehealth) or for referral (e.g., to mental health specialty care); and ongoing assessment and monitoring (e.g., using medical records) to facilitate measurement based care (MBC; i.e., systematic evaluation of patient symptoms before or during each clinical encounter to inform behavioral health treatment ) and promote continuity of care, over time. NIMH encourages applicants to consider existing resources on evidence-based and best practices (e.g., [National Action Alliance - Zero Suicide](https://theactionalliance.org/healthcare/zero-suicide); [Zero Suicide](http://https://zerosuicide.edc.org); [The Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal on Suicide Prevention](https://www.jointcommission.org/resources/patient-safety-topics/suicide-prevention/#8f5bfd1c09cb4f9f8d75fa3fb7d7a4ab_06ee0199c92743a6bba62e237f79d613)) and electronic medical records and billing codes that can currently be used to support service delivery, in order to expedite the development and testing of service-ready approaches. Research Objectives This FOA is intended to support rigorous evaluations of factors that impact or account for the effectiveness of existing suicide prevention practices and/or pilot clinical trials aimed at developing, optimizing, and pilot testing scalable patient-, provider-, and systems- level interventions and service delivery approaches for intervening at key intercepts in the chain of care. Suicide prevention services in primary care might involve a variety of strategies, depending on the goals and capacity within the setting. Depending on the research question, a variety of methodologically rigorous approaches may be indicated for proposed pilot studies. These may include pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental designs with non-randomized comparison groups, time-series designs, and other designs of equivalent rigor and relevance. Considerations for selecting a research design for the proposed study include the scientific question that the study is designed to answer, practical constraints, ethical issues, and the tradeoff between maximizing internal and external validity; the design that is proposed should be justified, accordingly, in the application. Applications in response to this FOA can address multi-component clinical workflows and/or optimize and test specific components that will advance practice effectiveness and efficiency. In the context of care pathways and clinical workflows that can include multiple intercepts with multiple opportunities and options for the delivery of services at each of these intercepts, as well as wide variation among practice settings, it is critical to identify effective, efficient, and generalizable services that will contribute to overall suicide risk reduction. Accordingly, for studies that evaluate multi-component approaches, the project must be designed to examine the unique contribution of the components (and/or combinations of components) in a manner that will facilitate interpretation of results and identification of the specific elements that account for observed benefit. The following research areas are examples of responsive application topics. Combinations of the strategies outlined, below, and other proposed aims may be appropriate, depending on the circumstances and suicide prevention goals for the primary care setting. Examples of responsive applications include, but are not limited to studies focused on: Risk identification, screening, and assessment, including applications that focus on: Preventive and therapeutic interventions, including studies that develop and pilot test: Strategies to promote service engagement/continuity, appropriate referral, and quality of care, including studies focused on: Consistent with the [NIMH experimental therapeutics approach](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/messages/2017/an-experimental-therapeutic-approach-to-psychosocial-interventions), for applications that test the preliminary effectiveness of preventive, therapeutic, or services interventions, or components of a suicide prevention clinical workflow, NIMH seeks to understand the mechanisms of action that account for changes in outcomes of interest. Consistent with the NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, the scope of work must include specification and assessment of the proximal intervention/service delivery targets/mechanisms and examination of whether changes can in the presumed targets/mechanisms account for the changes in outcomes (see [Support for Clinical Trials at NIMH](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas)). In this manner, the results of the trial will advance knowledge regarding therapeutic change mechanisms and can be informative regardless of trial outcomes (e.g., in the event of negative results, information about whether the clinical workflow components were successful at engaging its targets can facilitate interpretation). Given the focus on scalable, sustainable approaches, NIMH encourages community-partnered and deployment-focused approaches that systematically consider the perspective of key stakeholders (e.g., service users, providers, administrators, payers) and the characteristics of the primary care settings (e.g., available resources, including workforce capacity; existing clinical workflows) where optimized prevention strategies are intended to be implemented. Accordingly, collaborations between academic researchers and clinical or community practice partners or networks are encouraged. When possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the NIMH-sponsored [Mental Health Research Network (MHRN)](http://www.hcsrn.org/en/Collaboration/Consortia/mhrn.html), electronic medical records, access to administrative databases, patient registries, institutions with Clinical and Translational Science Awards) to facilitate the identification and collection of relevant clinician actions (e.g., CPT and billing codes; clinician notes) and potential measurement based outcomes, such as injury codes; patient utilization of care (emergency care; inpatient care; outpatient specialty care) and access to mortality outcomes. NIMH encourages studies that test intervention and service delivery strategies that incorporate features that are specifically designed to prevent threats to implementation fidelity, as appropriate. Strategies that might be used to enhance scalability and sustained implementation include but are not limited to: consumer-facing technology (e.g., self-administered content) and provider-facing technology (e.g., technology to support provider training and sustained implementation fidelity); expert consultation via existing resources or other sustainable means (e.g., telehealth, collaborative care approaches); or other robust design features that promote provider competence and sustained implementation fidelity. In addition to testing the effectiveness of the suicide prevention strategy under study, studies that test interventions should be designed to examine patient-, provider- and setting- level factors that might be associated with implementation fidelity or might be designed specifically test strategies to facilitate successful implementation. In this manner, research funded in response to this FOA will contribute to a better understanding of what will be needed to successfully implement suicide preventive interventions more broadly in primary care settings. Because patients with mental health problems often access primary care settings more frequently than mental health specialty care, suicide prevention implemented in primary care is likely to have a broader reach of individuals at risk, including those who experience mental health service disparities (e.g., racial/ethnic minority groups; sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural areas, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons). NIMH is committed to supporting research that reduces disparities and advances equity in mental health interventions, services, and outcomes. This FOA encourages pilot interventions and evaluations that seek to reduce disparities in outcomes for racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals limited by language or cultural barriers, sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural areas, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons, and other underserved groups. Thus, evaluations/pilot studies in response to this FOA should explore how the proposed suicide prevention practices can also reduce health disparities. Scale and Scope of Studies Covered Under this Announcement This FOA seeks primary care practice-based research aimed at rigorously evaluating existing and/or developing and pilot testing suicide prevention strategies. With appropriate justification, effectiveness testing of preventive and therapeutic interventions might be warranted in the absence of extensive efficacy data (e.g., when the intervention is primarily comprised of research-informed strategies, but the specific strategies that haven't been extensively tested in combination or with a specific target population; when there is strong pilot data and the goal is to conduct further testing in a deployment-focused manner to expedite the translation into practice). Pilot efforts in effectiveness research should be designed to evaluate the feasibility (including identifying resources necessary to implement suicide prevention efforts), acceptability, and to obtain preliminary data regarding the effectiveness of the approach, and data regarding putative targets/mechanisms for preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions, per NIMH's experimental therapeutics approach. The pilot study should be designed to yield data that are needed as a pre-requisite to a larger-scale, definitive study (e.g., effectiveness trial) that can be supported by other research mechanisms (e.g., R01; SBIR/STTR). Applications with data collection plans that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients/patients, therapists/providers, supervisors, administrators) should address provisions for human subject protections and consenting procedures for all participant groups, accordingly. Given the nature of suicide research, applications should include plans for operationalizing/measuring patient suicide risk and safety, including monitoring of current care approaches (i.e. treatment as usual) as well as monitoring of patient suicide risk during implementation of clinical workflows. The NIMH has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring ( [NOT-MH-19-027](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-19-027.html) and [Conducting Research with Participants at Elevated Risk for Suicide: Considerations for Researchers](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-research/conducting-research-with-participants-at-elevated-risk-for-suicide-considerations-for-researchers)). The application's Protection of Human Subjects section and data and safety monitoring plans should reflect the policies and guidance in the NIMH notice and website. Plans for the protection of research subjects and data and safety monitoring will be reviewed by the NIMH for consistency with NIMH and NIH policies and federal regulations. Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with NIH staff as early as possible when developing plans for an application (see Scientific/Research Contacts, Section VII). This early contact will provide an opportunity to clarify NIH policies and guidelines and help to identify whether the proposed project is consistent with NIMH program priorities and the goals of this FOA.

The following modifications also apply: All applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, must address a Data Sharing Plan To advance the goal of advancing research through widespread data sharing among researchers, investigators funded under this FOA are expected to share those data via the [National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive](https://nda.nih.gov/) (NDA; see [NOT-MH-19-033](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-19-033.html)). Established by the NIH, NDA is a secure informatics platform for scientific collaboration and data-sharing that enables the effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. NDA links data across research projects through its Global Unique Identifier (GUID) and Data Dictionary technology. Investigators funded under this FOA are expected to use these technologies to submit data to NDA. To accomplish this objective, it will be important to formulate a) an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a GUID for each participant, and b) a budget strategy that will cover the costs of data submission. The NDA web site provides two tools to help investigators develop appropriate strategies: 1) [the NDA Data Submission Cost Model](https://nda.nih.gov/contribute_cost_estimation.html) which offers a customizable Excel worksheet that includes tasks and hours for the Program Director/Principal Investigator and Data Manager to budget for data sharing; and 2) plain language text to be considered in your informed consent available from the NDA's [Data Contribution page](https://nda.nih.gov/contribute/contribute-data.html). Investigators are expected to certify the quality of all data generated by grants funded under this FOA prior to submission to NDA and review their data for accuracy after submission. Submission of descriptive/raw data is expected semi-annually (every January 15 and July 15); submission of all other data is expected at the time of publication, or prior to the end of the grant, whichever occurs first (see [NDA Sharing Regimen](https://nda.nih.gov/contribute/sharing-regimen.html) for more information); Investigators are expected to share results, positive and negative, specific to the cohorts and outcome measures studied. The NDA Data Sharing Plan is available for review on the [NDA website](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nda.nih.gov/Documents/NDA+Data+Sharing+Terms+and+Conditions+01.01.20.pdf). NDA staff will work with investigators to help them submit data types not yet defined in the [NDA Data Dictionary](https://nda.nih.gov/data_dictionary.html).

Use of Common Data Elements in NIH-funded Research Many NIH ICs encourage the use of common data elements (CDEs) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a \"Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal\" ( [http://cde.nih.gov/](http://cde.nih.gov/)) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects. NIMH has released expectations for collecting common data elements when an application involves human research participants. Details can be found at [NOT-MH-20-067](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-20-067.html) and the [NIMH webpage on Data Sharing for Applicants and Awardees](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/managing-your-grant/nimh-data-sharing-for-applicants-and-awardees). Applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in [the policy](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82299). Any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy. Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the [NIH mission](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149) are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. In addition, for applications involving clinical trials: A proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? How likely is it that the proposed research will generate data that will lead to a firm conclusion about the feasibility of a regular research project grant or full-scale clinical trial? To what extent will the results inform the next stages of research (e.g., a well-powered study to definitively test the approach)? How well does the application justify the practical effect of the clinical services being evaluated/pilot tested in terms of the estimated hypothesized effect size (e.g., improved risk identification/stratification, facilitating follow-up care, prevention/treatment for at-risk individuals), compared with already available approaches? How well does the application address both (1) the empirical basis for the anticipated effect size (e.g., citing data regarding the magnitude of the association between the target and the clinical endpoint of interest and/or effect sizes obtained in prior efficacy studies), and (2) the clinical meaningfulness of the anticipated increment in effects compared to existing approaches? Assess the potential of the proposed approach to be scalable and the potential for dissemination into practice given typically available resources (e.g., trained, skilled providers), typical service structures (including health care financing), and typical service use patterns. In addition, for applications involving clinical trials Are the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? For trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? For trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is this trial needed to advance scientific understanding? Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? As appropriate, how well does the study involve collaborations and/or input from community practice partners/providers, consumers, and relevant policy makers in a manner that informs the research (e.g., to help ensure that the intervention/service delivery approach is acceptable, practical, and scalable) and helps to ensure the results will have utility for end-users? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials With regard to the proposed leadership for the project, do the PD/PI(s) and key personnel have the expertise, experience, and ability to organize, manage and implement the proposed clinical trial and meet milestones and timelines? Do they have appropriate expertise in study coordination, data management and statistics? For a multicenter trial, is the organizational structure appropriate and does the application identify a core of potential center investigators and staffing for a coordinating center? Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? If applicable, to what extent are innovative research strategies and design/analytic elements incorporated in order to enhance the study's potential for yielding practice-relevant information? As relevant and appropriate, how well does the application leverage innovative applications of information technology to increase the reach, efficiency, or effectiveness for identification, prevention, and treatment of individuals at risk for suicide (e.g., use of predictive analytics or other decision science approaches for risk identification and stratification, use of mHealth and other technology-assisted approaches to promote intervention delivery or provider training)? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials Does the design/research plan include innovative elements, as appropriate, that enhance its sensitivity, potential for information or potential to advance scientific knowledge or clinical practice? Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Evaluate the degree to which the application provides a clear rationale and compelling empirical basis for the approach to enhancing suicide prevention in primary care in terms of the intended target population, and the clinical workflow. Are the associated resource demands (e.g., in terms of patient/consumer burden, provider/system demands) and required resources (e.g., provider qualitifcations, training and supervision requirements, administration/delivery time) considered and assessed? To what extent does the application include plans to involve collaborations and/or input from community practice partners/providers, consumers, and relevant policy makers in a manner that informs the research (e.g., to help ensure the interventions/service delivery approaches are acceptable, feasible, and scalable) and helps to ensure the results will have utility? How well does the application describe the consumer-, provider- and setting- level characteristics that will be assessed and the measures that will be used (e.g., standardized measures of provider attitudes/experience, clinic-/organizational characteristics) to examine factors that might be associated with uptake, implementation fidelity, and sustained use of the approach that is being tested? Are proposed outcome measures validated and generally accepted by the field? What is the rationale for plans for the assessment of suicidal behavior and related outcomes? Evaluate plans to include collection of sociodemographic, clinical, and other variables that might be used to explore moderators of effects. To what extent does the approach incorporate design features that will help ensure that the intervention can be feasibly implemented in practice, that it is scalable, and that it is robust against implementation drift (e.g., using technology as scaffolding or expert consultation via existing resources/ other sustainable means to support delivery)? Evaluate the provisions for collecting data in a manner that will facilitate data sharing. To what extent does the application utilize an enrollment and data collection strategy that will facilitate collection of de-identified, sharable data and include plans to use standard assessments and collection of common data elements, as appropriate)? How well does the study design address whether the preventive-, therapeutic-, or services- intervention engages the mechanism(s) presumed to underlie the intervention effects (the mechanism(s) that accounts for changes in clinical/ functional outcomes, changes inpatient or provider behavior, etc.)? To what extent does the application include: (1) a conceptual framework that clearly identifies the target(s)/mechanism(s) and the empirical evidence linking the target(s)/mechanism(s) to the clinical symptoms, functional deficits, or patient-, provider- or system-level behaviors/processes that the intervention seeks to improve; (2) plans for assessing engagement of the target(s)/mechanism(s) using valid measures that are as direct and objective as is feasible in the effectiveness context; and (3) analytic strategies that will be used to examine whether the intervention engages the target(s) and to conduct a preliminary examination of whether intervention-induced changes in the target(s) are associated with clinical benefit, as appropriate in the pilot trial? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials Does the application adequately address the following, if applicable Study Design Is the study design justified and appropriate to address primary and secondary outcome variable(s)/endpoints that will be clear, informative and relevant to the hypothesis being tested? Is the scientific rationale/premise of the study based on previously well-designed preclinical and/or clinical research? Given the methods used to assign participants and deliver interventions, is the study design adequately powered to answer the research question(s), test the proposed hypothesis/hypotheses, and provide interpretable results?

The application's PHS Human Subjects and Clinical Trials Information should reflect the manner in which these policies will be implemented for each study record. These plans will be reviewed by the NIMH for consistency with NIMH and NIH policies and federal regulations. The NIMH will expect clinical trials to be conducted in accordance with these policies including, but not limited to: timely registration to [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/), submission of review determinations from the clinical trial's data and safety monitoring entity (at least annually), timely submission of reportable events as prescribed, and establishment of recruitment milestones and progress reporting. Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA. ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the \"responsible party\" must register and submit results information for certain \"applicable clinical trials\" on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website ( [https://register.clinicaltrials.gov](https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/)). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see [https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm) Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols. Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at [http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm](//grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm) and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398). Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE). All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159), including of note, but not limited to: If a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions. Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex. This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html) and [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html). HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA.
