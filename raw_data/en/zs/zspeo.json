Groundbreaking for the campus occurred two years later, and during the following year, Ogeechee Technical Institute began offering its first credit program, Practical Nursing, with 25 students who graduated in Dece mber of 1990. Ogeechee Technical Institute assumed the responsibility for offering Adult Literacy programs and administering the General Equivalency Diploma (GED) examination in 1989. Faculty and staff moved into the new 75,000 square foot, $6 million sta te-of-the-art facility Fall of 1990, and additional program offerings began Spring Quarter 1991. The opening of Ogeechee Technical Institute coincided with the expansive growth of Georgia Southern University and the Statesboro area. In addition, the estab lishment of the Georgia State Lottery funded Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) financial aid program in 1993 was a contributing factor in the unprecedented growth of Ogeechee Technical Institute. In 1998, DTAE renamed the Commissioner's Awar d of Excellence the Rick Perkins Award for Excellence in Technical Instruction in memory and honor of the 1996 Commissioner's Award of Excellence winner, Thomas Rick Perkins, from Carroll Technical Institute. The award recognizes instructors who make signi ficant contributions to technical education through instructional excellence, outstanding leadership qualities, and dedication to DTAE's mission. In 1999, John Groover represented Ogeechee Tech as the winner of the Rick Perkins Award for Excellence in Tech nical Instruction for the state of Georgia. Ogeechee Technical Institute experienced a $5.5 million expansion by adding a Health Science Building and a Horticulture Building in 1999. During this time, Ogeechee Tech also increased its services through the opening of the Screven County Learning Center in Sylvania. Ogeechee Technical Institute offered its first Associate of Applied Technology (AAT) degree program in Industrial Manufacturing Technology Winter Quarter 2000, with eight students enrolled, and in the following academic year offered AAT degrees in Accounting, Computer Information Systems, Early Childhood Care and Education, Funeral Service Education, Health Information Technology, Marketing, and Opticianry. House Bill 1187, known as the A + Educat ion Reform Act, enacted in 2000, changed the names of technical institutes in Georgia to technical colleges. On July 6th of that year, Ogeechee Technical Institute officially became Ogeechee Technical College. Ogeechee Technical College awarded its first A AT degree in December 2000 in Early Childhood Care and Education. During the summer of 2002, Ogeechee Tech opened the Evans County Learning Center. Student growth continued at Ogeechee Technical College due largely to the addition of new programs, many of which are unique to DTAE, the state, and the region. These distinctive programs included certificate, diploma, and degrees in technical areas such as Funeral Service Education, Forensic Science Technology, and Opticianry. With the opening of the Occupatio nal Studies Building in Fall 2003, a wider variety of programs, such as Agribusiness, Wildlife and Plantation Management, Geographical Information Systems Technology, Veterinary Technology, Culinary Arts, and Hotel, Restaurant & Tourism Management, enabled the college to further expand its offerings. In 2004, Ogeechee Technical College paid tribute to the late Senator Joseph E. Kennedy for his role in the establishment of Ogeechee Technical Institute by dedicating the main building on campus as the Joseph E. Kennedy Building. On May 13, 2008, Governor Perdue signed legislation that officially changed the name of the Department of Technical and Adult Education. Effective July 1, 2008, the system became known as the Technical College System of Georgia. Gover nor Perdue also served as the keynote speaker for the 2008 Spring Commencement at Ogeechee Technical College. Shortly thereafter, Laura \"Molly\" Bickerton, a student in the College's Radiologic Technology program, was selected as Georgia's technical college Student of the Year in the 37th annual Georgia Occupational Award of Leadership (GOAL) competition. In July of 2008, Ogeechee Technical College was awarded a Regional Law Enforcement Academy in Claxton, Georgia. The project allowed new law enforcement of ficers to receive their basic law enforcement training at a state technical college and obtain college credit at the same time. Nearby in Hagan, Ogeechee Technical College began construction of the Evans Technical Education Complex. The new complex inclu ded the Logistics and Public Safety Building, a driving track for the Commercial Trucking program, and emergency vehicle operators track for the Regional Law Enforcement Academy. Towards the end of 2008, amid a downturn in the economy, a reduction in s tate funds, and rising gas prices, Ogeechee Technical College joined other technical colleges in the state to institute a four day work week. The move reduced the cost of utilities without reducing any services to students. Another big change came at the beginning of 2009 when an Emergency Mass Notification System for faculty, staff, and students was implemented. The new OTC -Alert system provided a way to send emergency warnings via cell phone and email messages. 9 Despite a challenging economy, good thin gs continued to happen at Ogeechee Tech. In an effort to offer better services to the students, Ogeechee Tech moved the Adult Education program to a new location adjacent to the main campus. In the fall of 2010, Governor Sonny Perdue returned to campus to speak at a ceremonial ground breaking for the new Health Science Building -North. In 2011, with changes to the HOPE scholarship, transitioning from quarters to semesters, and moving to a tobacco -free campus, Ogeechee Tech once again celebrated having t he Technical College System of Georgia's star student as local Georgia Occupational Award of Leadership winner, Alvie Coes, III, a Funeral Service Education student, was named state GOAL winner. Another accolade for the College was announced when Ogeechee Technical College was named the 2011 Technical College of the Year for the State of Georgia. Determined by meeting benchmarks in a variety of critical areas, Ogeechee Tech earned the top spot over all the other Colleges in the State system. In May 2012, the College consolidated its facilities in Evans County, in an effort to reduce the cost of operating two separate facilities, by moving the Adult Education classes and the Basic Law Enforcement programs to the Evans Technical Education Complex, joining t he Commercial Truck Driving program. In January 2013, classes began in the new Health Science Building -North. The Echocardiography, Opticianry, Radiologic Technology, Radiology Picture Archiving, and programs were relocated to this new, state -of- the-art building with classroom and lab space for each program. Included in the new facility are a modern biology lab, tiered lecture/demonstration hall, and a lobby and patio area which have proved to be popular sites for campus events. In November of that same year, the College broke ground on the new 60,000 square foot Natural Resources Building intended to house programs such as Agribusiness, Geographic Information Systems, and Fish and Wildlife Management. Soon thereafter in December, the College s urpassed a major milestone in its history by becoming a candidate for accreditation with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, and was named a finalist for the 2013 Technical College of the Year for the State of Georgia. A continuing effort to provide new and needed programs of study keeps Ogeechee Tech in the forefront of meeting the educational demands of citizens in this region of Georgia. With 3,223 students attending classes in 2013, the demand for Ogeechee Tech's s ervices is stronger than ever. With credit programs, continuing education, GED\u00ae and literacy programs, and various other services, the College's commitment to meet th e needs of the region continues .

Assessment The ability for a student to succeed in a program at Ogeechee Technical College is greatly determined by the math and language skills possessed by that student. Ogeechee Tech is committed to assisting each student to reach their maximum potential. All students applying for diploma, degree, and certificate pro grams must be assessed prior to acceptance to a program of study. Students will then be admitted in accordance with the academic standards applicable to that program. Ogeechee Tech utilizes COMPASS or ASSET, the TCSG - approved assessment instruments, when evaluating students for program readiness. However, in the place of COMPASS or ASSET, Ogeechee Tech may accept a student's official entrance score on a validated assessment instrument (such as SAT, ACT), or Georgia High School Graduation Test in English/ Language Arts if the scores meet the college program's required minimums. If a student's SAT, ACT, or Georgia High School Graduation Test in English/Language Arts scores do not meet the college program 's minimums for regular admission, a student must be a ssessed using one of the TCSG -approved instruments. Algebra scores are required only for Associate Degrees and certain other programs of study. All other programs require a Numerical Skills score. Assessment results will be valid for placement purposes fo r a period of 60 months and are transferable to any TCSG college. Official transcripts from a regionally or nationally accredited postsecondary institution recognized by the United States Department of Education documenting equivalent program -level Englis h and math coursework successfully completed (C or better) may be used in lieu of completing the corresponding portion of the TCSG - approved assessment instrument . Placement Testing The COMPASS placement exam consists of a series of four tests: Writing, Re ading, Mathematics, and Algebra. This test is an untimed, multiple choice examination given by computer. Required scores may be found in the Academic Programs section of this catalog. For a pplicants 13 who are uncomfortable with taking computerized tests or in certain other situations, Ogeechee Technical College offers ASSET, another state approved instrument published by ACT. ASSET consists of a series of four tests: Writing, Reading, Numerical Skills, and Elementary Algebra. This test is a paper and pencil and multiple choice format with each section timed at 25 minutes. The first placement exam given for admissions into Ogeechee Tech is free of charge. Retesting is allowed for new students only, and new students may retest only one time. There is a $15 re test fee payable prior to testing. Admissions Categories Minimum admissions requirements are established for each program.

Applicants who have been previously enrolled at a postsecondary institution and desire entrance into one of the competitive admission programs ( Diagnostic Medical Sonography , Echocardiography, Practical Nursing, Radiologic Technology , or Surgical Technology ) must meet certain specific requirements listed in the Ogeechee Technical College Catalog and Student Handbook . Criminal Back ground Checks and Drug Screenings are not transferable. Students may be eligible for advanced placement through two methods: transfer credit and exemption credit. This policy guides all advanced placement activities at Ogeechee Technical College. Adva nced placement allows a student to receive course credit based on previous experience, formal or informal, and results in advanced standing within a certificate, diploma, and degree program. Ogeechee Technical College does not award academic credit for cou rse work taken on a noncredit basis. Transfer Credit Ogeechee Technical College recognizes previous postsecondary coursework by accepting credits earned from other regionally or nationally accredited institutions that are applicable to the student's prog ram of study . A student who presents credit for evaluation and transfer must be aware that the awarding of credit does not guarantee that institutions subsequently attended by the student will accept those credits. Credit for courses received at an instit ution accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) and whose entrance requirements and curriculum are equivalent to or greater than those of OTC wi ll be considered for award of transfer credit. Credit may be granted for formal military schools, training and correspondence courses in accordance with the American Council on Education. Ogeechee Tech recognizes that it is necessary to establish reasonabl e and definitive policies for accepting transfer credit. The College developed these guidelines in accordance with the standards set by the American Association of Collegiate Registrar's and Admissions Officers. Ogeechee Tech distinguishes between the acc eptance of credit and the applicability toward program requirements. Applicability of credit toward a credential refers to the 17 prerogative of the academic divisions to count specific credit toward fulfillment of graduation requirements. The Registrar dete rmines the transferability of courses taken at other postsecondary institutions by considering the educational quality of the learning experience for which the students seeks transfer credit; the comparability of the nature, content, and level of learning experiences to the courses offered at Ogeechee Tech (the course is essentially the same content as the course to be taken at the College); and the appropriateness and applicability of the learning experience to the programs offered at Ogeechee Tech and how recently the occurred. The College established the following proc edures to guide the Registrar in awarding transfer credit: In order for the Registrar to evaluate credit, the students must submit official transcripts from all colleges to Ogeechee Tech. All official transcripts must include final grades. The student must also complete and submit the Transfer/Articulated Credit Evaluation form requesting the evaluation of their transcript(s) to the Registrar. Students may receive transfer credit for cours es for which they earned a C or better. The Registrar will not award transfer credit with grades below a C, including D, F, I, IP, W, WF, and WP. Due to the rapid changes in technology and technical information, program -specific courses will be considered for transfer credit in a program only if the coursework has been completed within the past five years (60 months) . Technical courses that were taken five years prior to admission to Ogeechee Tech will be evaluated for technical currency for course content by the program faculty. A student desiring consideration of credit for technical courses or experiences that are more than five years old can request transfer by exemption testing. Transfer credit will be considered without restriction of completion dates for those courses in academic disciplines. Examples of these courses include, but are not limited to, English, psychology, mathematics, physical sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences . The Registrar will not award transfer credit for learning supp ort coursework or other institutional courses such as college orientation courses taken at other colleges. The transfer credit is recorded as TRA, TRB, or TRC on the Ogeechee Tech transcript and is not included in the calculation of the semester, cumulati ve, or graduation grade point average. The third letter indicates the actual grade earned in the course. For competitive admission programs, grades for credit earned as transfer credit will be evaluated for GPA and calculated in the GPA under consideratio n for program admission. Students may access their records online through the College website via BannerWeb to verify the transfer credit awarded by the Registrar. If coursework is earned at a nationally accredited college, Ogeechee Tech reserves the right to evaluate instructor credentials applicable to the requested transfer coursework. A student who has attended a previous college and is eligible for transfer of credit for English and math is not required to take the COMPASS placement exam. However, if the student for any reason takes the exam and scores indicate the need for a learning support class, the student forfeits evaluation of their transcript and the scores on the exam will determine placement, except in the case of a competitive admissions pro gram. Students wishing to transfer from Ogeechee Tech to another college must contact that college directly to determine transfer of credit. Experiential Learnin g/Military Training Credit Credit may be awarded for education/training experiences in the Armed Services. Such experiences must be certified by the American Council on Education (identified in the Council's publication: Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services) or the official catalog of the Community College of the Air Force or a similar document. The experiential learning will be evaluated by the program instructor along with the Registrar to determine the course competencies. Credit will be given on the basis of individual evaluation. Course information must b e present on the Armed Forces transcript. Credible military experience must closely correspond to the course(s) in the Ogeechee Tech curriculum content and competencies. The time limit specified in the transfer credit section also applies to the experienti al learning. Professional Certification Ogeechee Technical College considers credit awarded for non-collegiate educational programs as recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE). ACE's National Guide to College Credit for Workforce Training and National Guide to Credit Recommendations for Non - collegiate Courses contain recommendations for experiential learning and professional examinations or certifications offered by other organizations separate of postsecondary educational institutions, inclu ding agencies offering professional certifications and the military. Documentation is required. The faculty member of the program in which the student is enrolled evaluates the documentation to determine if the experience meets or exceeds the program/cours e standards and makes a recommendation to the Registrar only if sufficient documentation is provided. Final determination is made by the Registrar. The process ensures all course work and outcomes are at the appropriate collegiate level. Foreign Earned C redit 18 Credit may be awarded based upon an evaluation performed by an independent evaluation service. Recommended evaluation services are available in the Admissions Office. The Registrar will make the final decision regarding the award of transfer credit. Grade points will not be assigned to transfer credit. Articulated Credit Articulated Credit is an option that allows high school students to receive advanced placement or exempt courses by taking articulated courses in high school. The student must subm it a high school transcript showing the completed courses the student wants to receive credit from. Ogeechee Technical College must validate student competencies before awarding articulated credit for competencies learned in high school by administering the final examination/exemption examination for the course to be articulated. No fee shall be charged to students taking an exam to validate articulated credit from high school. The student must score equal to or higher than the required scores for the cou rses. The College shall bank credit after a high school student successfully passes the exemption exam required to articulate subject credit. This credit shall be applied to the student's record once he/she matriculates to the College. The high school student must matriculate within 2 years after high school graduation, unless dictated by programs standards. A list of approved courses is available from a high school counselor or the Admissions Office. Ogeechee Tech will honor local articulation agreem ents statewide when students move from one area of the state to another and will validate the credit by administering the final examination/exemption examination for the course being transferred. Articulated credit awarded will be indicated on transcript/ permanent records by use of the letters \"AC.\" Institutional Exemption Exam A student may receive credit for courses by passing an exemption examination only if the student has never attempted the course nor made a grade of D or F in an equivalent course a t OTC or another postsecondary institution. A student cannot withdraw from a course and register to take an exemption examination within the same term nor can a student take an exemption examination if he/she is currently registered for the course. Studen ts wishing to pursue credit by examination must: Never have attempted the course at Ogeechee Technical College; Never have made a D or F in an equivalent course at another postsecondary institution; Be admitted and enrolled in a program of study at Ogeec hee Technical College; Be able to present evidence which would indicate that the student has the education, training, or work experience similar to that given in a course being challenged . Faculty members are not eligible to take OTC exemption exams. Comp lete the Application for Credit by Examination form, and obtain approval from the student's academic advisor and the instructor responsible for administering the exam, the Academic Dean, and the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs; Take the appli cation to the Business Office in Building 600 (JEK Annex) and pay the TCSG approved non -refundable fee for the examination; Present the application and a receipt of payment to the instructor responsible for administering the examination; and Earn a score of at least a \"C\". NOTE: Exemption exams are normally given during the final week of a semester. Completed applications must be submitted at least fourteen calendar days before the beginning of the final week of a semester. A grade of \"EXE\" will be entered on the permanent record if the exemption exam is successfully completed. The hours for the exempted grades will not be computed in the grade point average. NOTE: The Academic Affairs Division determines which courses exemption exams may be given fo r. A list of courses is available in the Office of the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs. Academic Affairs reserves the right to change the courses on this list at any time and without notice. Standardized Exam Credit Credit may be awarded b ased on nationally normed exams including, but not limited to, the following: CLEP - Credit will be awarded for successful completion of any appropriate CLEP (College Level Examination Program) subject area examinations. Credit should be awarded based on s core recommendations of the Council on College Level Services. Advanced Placement Examinations - Credit will be awarded to students who have taken appropriate courses (determined equivalent to courses offered at the College) in high school and achieve a sc ore of 3 or more on the Advanced Placement Examination. The Advanced Placement Examinations are offered by the College Entrance Examination Board. 19 International Baccalaureate Credit - Credit will be awarded to students who have taken appropriate courses (determined equivalent to courses offered at a Technical College) in high school and achieve a score of 3 or more on the International Baccalaureate Examination. The IB Examinations are offered by the International Baccalaureate Examination Board Residence Requirements for Degree/Diploma Ogeechee Technical College requires that a minimum of twenty -five percent (25%) of the coursework of a particular program of study be completed at the College in order to be granted an award. Changing Program of Study If students change their program of study at Ogeechee Tech, any courses common to the original program of study and the new program of study are transferable, providing that the student received a minimum score of C for the course. Transient Courses A trans ient student is a student who is currently enrolled at one postsecondary institution seeking to take classes at another postsecondary institution. At Ogeechee Tech, students must obtain permission from their program advisor before applying as a transient student to other postsecondary institutions through www.gvtc.org. Grading procedures for transient students are the same as for traditional students. Therefore, the transient student's grade will be sent from the host school to Ogeechee Tech (home school) for recording of the grade upon completion of the course. The grade becomes a part of the student's permanent record. The grade will be recorded as a transfer credit. 20 CAMPUS SAFETY AND SE CURITY EMERGENCY CONT ACT INFORMATION All emergencies should be reported to the receptionist at (912) 681 .5664 or 5664 for internal calls on the main campus.

Ogeechee Technical College (OTC) is required by the U.S. Department of Education to establish minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) means the student is proceeding in a positive manner toward fulfilling educational requirements. Students attending OTC must be in good academic standing and making satisfactory progress. OTC 28 uses the following standa rds to monitor students ' progress toward their diploma, degree, or certificate: Grade Point Average Students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.0 to remain in good standing. A student's GPA will be monitored at the end of e ach semester . A student whose cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0 is placed on financial aid warning for t he next semester of attendance. This will allow the student one semester to increase the cumulative GPA to the satisfactory level. If, after one semes ter, the GPA remains below 2.0, the student will lose financial aid eligibility (placed on financial aid suspension). Students may receive financial aid while on warning. Student s will not receive financial aid while on suspension . Maximum Time Frame There are a maximum number of hours that students may attempt in pursuing their program of study. All students must complete their educational objective within a maximum time frame of one and one half (150 percent) times the length of the program in which they are enrolled. This means that once a student has attempted one and one half times the minimum number of credit hours necessary for completing program requirements, the student is ineligible to receive financial aid. Completion Rate In order for stu dents to graduate within this maximum \"time frame\" of hours, at the end of each semester they are expected to have cumulatively completed at least 66.6% of their credit hours attempted. A student who at the end of any semester has not successfully complet ed 66.6% of the cumulative hours attempted will be placed on financial aid warning for the next semester of attendance. This will allow the student one semester to increase the cumulative completion rate to the satisfactory level. If, after one semester , the cumulative completion rate remains below 66.6% , the student will lose financial aid eligibility (placed on financial aid suspension). Students may receive financial aid while on warning. Student s will not receive financial aid while on suspension. Grades The following grades are calculated in the completion rate but do not count toward successful completion: I , W, WP, F, or WF. Repeat courses will be considered as any other class and both grades will be counted in both the GPA and completion rate . A grade of A*, B*, or C* will be considered satisfactory completion of a learning support course. A grade of D* and F* will be considered unsatisfactory. Grades received for learning support courses are not calculated in the GPA, but the hours are calculated in the 66.6% cumulative completion rate. Transfer Students Transfer students accepted by Ogeechee Technical College (OTC ) but not previously enrolled at OTC will be classified as maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress for the first semester enrolled. Only classes transferred in will be used in the completion rate calculation. At the end of the first semester , the student's grades will be m easured in accordance with the C ollege's Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements. Students who previo usly attended OTC, transferred to another school, and then returned to OTC, will have all OTC courses and courses transferred from other institutions calculated in the cumulative completion rate. Warning/Suspension If a student fails to meet the cumulative GPA, cumulative completion rate, or the maximum time frame standards at the end of a semester , the student will be placed on Financial Aid Warning. The student will continue to receive financial aid while on financial aid warning. However, if the studen t does not meet the Satisfactory Academic P rogress standards by the end of the warning period, he /she will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. The student can continue taking courses while on financial aid suspension at the student's expense. Appeal of Financial Aid Suspension Students have the right to appeal their suspension of financial aid if they have mitigating circumstances that prevented them from making satisfactory academic progress.

Policy Academic institutions exist for the transmission of knowledge, the pursuit of truth, the development of students, and the well -being of society. Free inquiry and free expression are indispensable to the attainment of these goals . As members of this academic community, students are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for knowledge. Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic cond itions in the classroom, on the campus, other college sites, and in the community. Students are expected to exercise their freedom with responsibility. As members of the academic community, students are subject to the obligations which accrue to them by vi rtue of this membership. As members of the larger community of which the college is a part, students are entitled to all rights and protection accorded them by the laws of the community. Nothing in the Code of Conduct shall be interpreted to interfere with any person's right to free speech as provided by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. By the same token, students are also subject to all laws, the enforcement of which is the responsibility of duly constituted authori ties. When students violate laws, they may incur penalties prescribed by legal authorities. In such instances, college discipline will be initiated if the presence of the student on campus is considered a possible threat to persons or property, or if that person's presence may disrupt the educational process of the college. However, when a student's violation of the law also adversely affects the college's recognized educational objectives, or violates the college's Student Code of Conduct, the college will enforce its own regulations. When students violate college regulations, they are subject to disciplinary action by the college whether or not their conduct violates the law. It is the policy of the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) and Ogeechee Technical College to provide technical and adult education programs for the people of Georgia. TCSG's technical colleges must provide opportunities for intellectual, emotional, social, and physical growth. Ogeechee Technical College students assume an obli gation to act in a manner compatible with the fulfillment of the mission. The technical college community recognizes its responsibility to provide an atmosphere conducive to growth. With these principles in mind, the Technical College System of Georgia est ablishes this Student Code of Conduct. Generally, technical college jurisdiction and discipline shall be limited to conduct which occurs on technical college premises, off -campus classes, activities or functions sponsored by the technical college, an exam ination or any other written or oral work submitted for evaluation and/or a grade, or which otherwise adversely affects members of the technical college community and/or the pursuit of the technical college's objectives.

Grading System Grades are issued at the end of each semester using the following grading system(s): For Credit: Grades Explanation Grade Points A Excellent (90 -100) 4 B Good (80 -89) 3 C Satisfactory (70-79) 2 D Poor (60 -69) 1 F Failing (0 -59) 0 WF Withdrew Failing 0 W Withdrew Not Computed WM Withdrew Military Not Computed WP Withdrew Passing Not Computed I Incomplete Not Computed AU Audit/Warranty Not Computed EX Credit by Exam Not Computed TRA Transfer Credit Not Computed TRB Transfer Credit Not Computed TRC Transfer Credit Not Computed AC Articulated Credit Not Computed Learning Support (Institutional Credit): A * Excellent (90 -100) Not Computed B * Good (80 -89) Not Computed C * Satisfactory (70 -79) Not Computed D * Poor (60 -69) Not Computed F * Failing (0 -59) Not Computed I* Incomplete Not Computed \"WF\" Withdrew Failing - After mid -semester , the student was failing upon withdrawing or being dropped from t he course. \"W\" Withdrew - The student withdrew or was dropped from the course on or before mid -semester . \"WM\" Withdrew Military - The student withdrew from school in response to being called to active military duty. \"WP\" Withdrew passing - After mid -semest er, the student was passing upon withdrawing or being dropped from the course. \"I\" Incomplete - The grade \"I\" may be given to any student who has not completed all required work by the end of the semester . If the required make -up work is not completed by t he last day of the following semester , the instructor will submit the Completion Form for Incomplete Grades with a grade of \"F\" for the course. When a student receives a grade of \"I\" in a course which is a prerequisite to other courses, the student must co mplete the required make -up work to determine the final grade and eligibility to enroll in subsequent courses. \"AU\" Audit/Warranty - Indicates that a course was audited. No credit is given. This is not computed into GPA. Exceptions to this policy include certain laboratory courses and supervised work experience. \"EX\" Exempted/Credit by Exam - The student received credit for a course by successfully completing a competency examination on the coursework. \"TRA\", \"TRB\", \"TRC\" Transfer Credit - The student transferred coursework to the College from another regionally or nationally accredited college. A student may transfer up to 75% of the total credits required for the program of study. The Registrar may confer with academic deans or program instructors when d etermining appropriateness of transfer request but is responsible for final transfer credit approval. \"AC\" Articulated Credit - The student earned credit for coursework completed at the secondary level. Validation of Credit - Ogeechee Technical College m ust validate student competencies before awarding articulated credit for competencies learned in high school by administering the final examination/exemption examination for the course to be articulated. Learning Support - A grade with an asterisk followin g is a learning support grade and is not computed in a student's GPA. Grade Point Average Grade point average (GPA) is the numerical average computed by dividing total quality points (for each course, hours attempted multiplied by grade value) by total ho urs attempted each semester (see below). A cumulative GPA is calculated by dividing total quality points by total hours attempted at the College. For example: 25 Total Quality Points divided by 11 Hours Attempted equals a GPA of 2.27. Class Code Hours Attempted Grade Grade Value Quality Points MATH 1013 3 A 4 12 ENGL 1010 3 B 3 9 COMP 3 F 0 0 62 1000 EMPL 1000 2 C 2 4 11 25 Work Ethics All courses at Ogeechee Technical College will positively reinforce the work ethics traits through discussion, model ing of behavior, and other assignments ; however, formal grading on work ethics will be done in program capstone courses only. The work ethics traits will be introduced in a designated entry level course in each program. The instructor for the course will introduce the traits in a method that suits the design of the course and program. Program instructors will continue to incorporate the work ethics traits informally throughout the program courses. The work ethics traits will be emphasized formally again in a designated capstone course for the program. Instruction containing program -specific characteristics of the traits will be included for this course. A written student self - assessment and a written evaluation by the instructor of the student's behavior demonstrating adoption of the work ethics traits will be done before course completion and discussed with the student. A work ethics grade of Pass (2) or Fail (0) will be assigned in addition to the course grade for this capstone course and will appear on the student's transcript. Grade Reports Final grades are recorded by instructors. Official grades are posted to the s tudent's transcript via BannerWeb . Academic Appeals Ogeechee Technical College faculty and administrative staff have the right and respons ibility to exercise professional judgment in making decisions about student performance and progress. The College is accountable for setting and maintaining standards of academic performance and is committed to ensuring students are treated fairly in regar d to all matters that relate to academic performance and progress. A student will be provided with a fair opportunity to have decisions that are believed by the student to negatively impact academic performance and progress reviewed in accordance with poli cies and procedures established by the College. Informal If a student believes that a basis exists for appealing an academic decision regarding a grade which prevents progression in a program of study, that student should first attempt to resolve the matte r informally through discussion with the instructor who made the decision. A student has five (5) working days to discuss the academic decision. If no resolution can be reached within these five (5) working days, then the student will have another five (5) working days to discuss the concern with the Dean for Academic Affairs . The expectation is that the difference of opinion is to be resolved as closely as possible to the level at which it originated, and as quickly as is possible with careful review. It i s only when a disagreement cannot be resolved through this informal process that a formal appeal of the academic decision should be made. A student may seek advice from a counselor for support and direction. Formal Once a decision has been made that the i nformal process has not resulted in resolution, formal procedures will begin. Written notification to the Dean for Academic Affairs must be made regarding the decision under question. The Dean for Academic Affairs , upon completion of his/her review (course outline, documentation related to the student's progress, transcript, summary of events, etc.) may uphold, modify, or reverse the academic decision. The Dean for Academic Affairs will notify the student, the instructor, and the Registrar (if necessary) in writing of his/her decision with a rationale for the decision. If any party believes that the decision is not fair or reasonable, the decision may be appealed to the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs. This gives the opportunity to ensure that all necessary and relevant information, documentation, opinion, and argument are fairly presented. The decision of the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs is final. Repeating Courses By registering for a course for which the student has already r eceived credit, a student forfeits the previous credit in that course for graduation purposes. The student's official grade for graduation purposes in the course(s) will be the last one earned on repetition. Although all grades remain on the official acade mic record, only the final attempt will be calculated for the purpose of meeting graduation requirements. For graduation purposes, a student must have a graduation GPA of a 2.0 and a cumulative GPA of 2.0. A student who fails or who doe s not earn a passing grade as required for courses specified in the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook within two attempts will not be allowed to repeat that course for one year and will be allowed to retake a third time on a space -available basis only. Before retaking a course the third time , the student must complete any remediation assigned by the appropriate Dean for Academic Affairs . A student may request from the appropriate Dean an exemption to this requirement if the student feels that additional information should be considered. Academic Probation and Suspension Students must maintain a minimum of a 2.0 cumulative grade point average to be in satisfactory academic standing. Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below a 2.0 will be placed on academic probat ion for the next academic semester . A student is subject to 63 suspension for one semester if the cumulative grade point average is less than a 2.0 during the semester enrolled on academic probation. Students will be advised and counseled as to academic defic iencies and given official notification of academic probation/suspension status. Academic probation or suspension is indicated on the student's transcript via BannerWeb and recorded on the student's permanent academic record. Academic Transcript Request Pr ocess Students can receive an unofficial transcript via BannerWeb . The first official transcript for a student is provided free of charge. A fee of $5.00 will be charged for each additional official transcript, which must be paid before the transcript is r eleased. Transcripts will not be released externally without the student's written consent unless as directed by law to comply. (Transcripts will be released in compliance with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. However, every reasonable attempt will be made to notify the student in advance of the compliance.) An academic transcript will be issued within three (3) business days of receiving a written request. The Academic Transcript Request form may be obtain ed in the Registrar's Office or on the Ogeechee Tech website using the BannerWeb electronic request/signature . If the student is unable to come to the Registrar's Office or download the form, Ogeechee Technical College will accept written consent in the form of a letter (either mailed or faxed ) from the student. Enrollment Verification Students requiring verification for insurance, loan deferments, military I.D., past and current enrollment, and degree(s) earned can now access this information through the Self -Service program with the National Student Clearinghouse. Ogeechee Technical College has authorized the N ational Student Clearinghouse to provide enrollment verification certifications for students through its Web - based Student Self -Service program. Student Self -Service enables students to print official enrollment verification certifications on demand through their BannerWeb account at www.ogeecheetech.edu. Instructions are located in the Registrar's Office and online . Verification of enrollment status is based on the number of semester cre dit hours for which a student is or was enrolled. Full -time students carry 12 or more credit hours, three -quarter students carry nine to eleven credit hours, half-time students carry six to eight credit hours, and less than half -time students carry one to five credit hours. Withdrawing from a Course or the College Students withdrawing from courses or the College must complete an Application for Withdrawal form, which may be obtained from the Student Affairs Center, academic advisor, or the Counseling and Re tention Coordinator. The effective date of the withdrawal is the last date the student attended or the last date of academic activity. The impact a withdrawal has on the student's academic record is determined on a course -by-course basis. In certain cases , the Counselor or Registrar may act on behalf of the student in completing the withdrawal process. Typically, this would occur in cases involving death, serious injury or illness, or formal requests to do so. Failure to attend classes does not constitute an official withdrawal. Students who fail to continue attending class and who do not complete an Application for Withdrawal form may be awarded a withdrawal -failing (WF) grade by the instructor. The instructor must still report the last date the student at tended or the last date of academic activity to comply with the Federal Refund Policy. Students who withdraw from a course and have attended 60% or less of the course will receive a \"W\". Students who withdraw from a course and have attended more than 60% of the course will be issued a \"WF\" if the student was failing or a \"WP\" if the student was passing upon withdrawing or being dropped from the course. The 60% attendance date for each term is posted on the Campus Calendar located online at www.ogeecheetech .edu. If a student is called to active duty during a semester, he/she will be issued a WM, Withdrew Military. Ogeechee Technical College calculates earned Title IV federal fund amounts based on attendance. A student receiving Title IV federal funds, such as loans and the Pell Grant, and withdraws prior to attending sixty percent (60%) of the semester, will only receive the earned amount. Since choosing to drop a course is a serious academic decision that may affect a student's progress towards a degree o r a student's financial aid status, a student should consult with the instructor of the course, the academic advisor, and a financial aid advisor before making this decision. Limited Withdrawals Students may withdraw from a maximum of three (3) courses at the College. If a student wants to withdraw from a course after he/she has accumulated three \"W\" grades, he/she may elect to receive a \"withdrawal -failing\" (WF) grade for the course or remain in the course. The grade of \"WF\" is calculated as an \"F\" for G PA purposes. Students are encouraged to verify the official number of withdrawals on their record as indicated in Banner prior to processing a withdrawal . Students may not exercise the right to withdraw to avoid sanction for academic dishonesty. It is the responsibility of the student to complete the withdrawal process. A withdrawal is official when it is received and processed by the Registrar's Office. The following types of withdrawals do not count against the limit of three course withdrawal (\"W\") grade s: Exceptions Hardship withdrawals Medic al or mental health withdrawals Military withdrawals 64 Withdrawals during the f irst three days of the semester Withdrawals taken in semesters before Fall Semester 2013. Withdrawals taken at other institutions. Hards hip Withdrawals Procedure A student who has an emergency that prevents him/her from completing all classes for that term may request a Hardship Withdrawal through the Withdrawal Exemption Committee. Students must contact the Counseling and Retention Coordinator to withdraw them from all of their current semester classes. Students are strongly encouraged to contact their instructors by phone and/or email to notify them of their intentions to withdraw. Students must provide hardship documentation to the Withdrawal Exception Committee, including a letter from the student explaining the circumstances along with supporting documentation such as the following: for a death in the immediate family, a verifiable obituary; for a serious illness in the immediate fa mily, documentation recommending withdrawal from a physician on the physician's letterhead signed by the physician (documentation on a prescription pad is unacceptable); for a workplace change, documentation from the employer on the company's letterhead. The hardship withdrawal process cannot begin until both the students' written permission and the supporting documentation have been received and verified. In cases where the student is petitioning to change a regular withdrawal to a hardship withdrawal, th e actual assigned grade (\"W\") will not change; if the petition is granted, that withdrawal will not count towards the Limited Withdrawal policy. Medical Withdrawal Procedure A student who has an injury or illness that prevents the completion of all classe s for that term may request a Medical Withdrawal through the Withdrawal Exemption Committee.

(In some clinical programs, the student may subsequently be required to submit medical documentation to their program advisor or/and instructor prior to enrolling in future coursework as verification that the student is eligible to return to class.) If the documentation proves to be untruthful, the College reserves the right not to grant the request or to revoke the withdrawal. In cases where the student is petitioning to change a regular withdrawal to a medical withdraw al, the actual assigned grade (\"W\") will not change; if the petition is granted, that withdrawal will not count towards the Limited Withdrawal policy.
