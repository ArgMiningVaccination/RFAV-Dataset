Purpose The purpose of this standing order is to reduce morbidity and mortality of influenza infection in Arkansas by allowing Arkansas -licensed pharmacists to initiate therapy including ordering and/or dispensing treatment medications, along with any necessary supplies for administration, to eligible persons who are influenza positive or who have househol d exposure . II. Authority This standing order is issued pursuant to Act 503 of 2021 (HB 1246) (Arkansas Code \u00a7 17-92- 101) to authorize licensed pharmacists in Arkansas to order and/or dispense influenza treatment medications according to the provisions of Arkansas Code \u00a7 17 -92-101 and the requirements of this standing order. III. Screening and Assessment The Board of Pharmacy will adopt screening assessment and questionnaire (Appendix A) to be used by pharmacists throughout th e state. When a patient requests point- of-care testing services, or when a pharmacist, in his or her professional judgement, decides to initiate point - of-care testing and treatment, the patient will be assessed for presenting signs and symptoms that warran t influenza testing, parental consent for individuals under the age of 18, and if appropriate, administer a rapid influenza point -of-care test. IV. Dispensing Guidelines A. Eligibility Criteria Inclusion: Age 3 years and older Reported symptoms or household exposure onset < 48 hours before time of presentation CLIA -waived point -of-care test for influenza virus is performed or household exposure Exclusion: History of adverse reactions to any previous influenza treatment Pregnanc y Use of antiviral therapy for influenza in the past 30 days Flu-like symptoms for more than 48 hours Immunocompromised defined as: o Been receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood Page 2 of 5 o Received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system o Received a stem cell transplant within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system o Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott -Aldrich syndrome) o Advanced o r untreated HIV infection o Active treatment with high- dose corticosteroids (20mg prednisone daily for >2 weeks) or other drugs that may suppress your immune response Clinically unstable based on the clinical judgement of the pharmacist or any of the following criteria: o Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure < 60 mmHg For age 3 -9 years: Systolic blood pressure <70 (age in 2) pulse oximetry B.

Warnings/Precautions 1. Oseltamivir Disease -related concerns o Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with chronic cardiac disease o Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment o Renal impairment: Use with caution; dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. Not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) not undergoing dialysis o Respiratory disease: Use with caution in patients with respirato ry disease Dosage forms specific issues o Some dosage form may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid which are metabolites of benzyl alcohol and have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity in neonate (\"gasping syndrome\") o Oral suspension contains so rbitol (delivers ~2 g sorbitol per 75 mg dose) which is greater than the maximum daily limit for patients with hereditary fructose intolerance; may cause diarrhea and dyspepsia; use with caution Appropriate Use Page 4 of 5 o Oseltamivir is not a substitute for the infl uenza virus vaccine. It has not been shown to prevent primary or concomitant bacterial infections that may occur with influenza virus. Antiviral treatment should begin within 48 hours of symptom onset; however, the CDC recommends that treatment may still b e beneficial and should be started in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness, and in hospitalized patients if >48 hours. Treatment should not be delayed while awaiting results of laboratory tests for influenza. Outpatients who are not at high risk for developing severe or complicated illness are not likely to benefit if treatment is started >48 hours after symptom onset (CDC 2020a). 2. Zanamivir Concerns related to adverse effects o Allergic reactions: Allergic -like reactions, including anaphy laxis, oropharyngeal edema, and serious skin rashes have been reported. Discontinue use and institute appropriate treatment if an allergic reaction occurs. o Neuropsychiatric events: rare occurrences of neuropsychiatric events (including confusion, delirium, hallucinations, seizure, and/or self -injury) have been reported, primarily in pediatric patients; may be abrupt in onset. Direct causation is difficult to establish; influenza infection may also be associated with behavioral and neurologic changes. o Respir atory effects: B ronchospasm, including serious cases and some with fatal outcomes, and decreased lung function have been reported in patients with and without airway disease; discontinue with bronchospasm or decreased lung function. For a patient with an underlying airway disease where a medical decision has been made to use zanamivir, a fast -acting bronchodilator should be made available. Respiratory disease o Not recommended for use in patients with underlying respiratory disease, such as asthma or COPD, due to lack of efficacy in influenza treatment and risk of serious bronchospasm. If zanamivir is prescribed in such patients, closely monitor respiratory function. Nursing home patients o Nursing home patients: Effectiveness has not been established fo r prophylaxis of influenza in nursing home patients (per manufacturer); however, the CDC recommends zanamivir as an option to be used to control institutional outbreaks of influenza (refer to current guidelines) (CDC 2020a). 3. Baloxavir Bacterial infection o There is no evidence of efficacy of baloxavir marboxil in illnesses (eg, bacterial infections) caused by pathogens other than influenza viruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza -like symptoms, may Page 5 of 5 coexist with, or occur as an influenza complication. Baloxavir marboxil has not been shown to prevent such complications. Monitor for potential secondary bacterial infections and manage appropriately. Hypersensitivity o Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, and erythema multiforme have been reported; evaluate and treat accordingly. E. Documentation Positive influenza cases that result in hospitalization or death are required to be reported to the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) at https://flureport.adh.arkansas.gov . To aid in influenza surveillance, ADH also encourages providers to report other positive influenza test results to the same website . Patient records must be furnished to a health care practitioner designated by the patient upon the request of the patient. Documentation may include, but is not limited to, presenting signs and symptoms that warrant influenza testing, parental consent for individuals under the age of 18, and results of RIDT. Maintain records of all patients receiving services for two (2) years.
