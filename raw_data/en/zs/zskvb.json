J. PALMER, D. C., Ph.C. ________ FOURTH EDITION ILLUSTRATED ________ THE PALMER SCHOOL OF CHIROPRACTIC, PUBLISHER \"CHIROPRACTIC FOUNTAIN HEAD\" DAVENPORT, IOWA, U. S. A. ______ 1920Copyright, 1906, 1910, 1917 and 1920 B. J. PALMER, D. C., Ph. C. Davenport, Iowa, U. S. A.B. J. PALMER, D. C., Ph. C. Pres. of The P. S. C. Following is a good likeness of \"B. J.\" He has shown indomitable will and courage in preserving the science ofChiropractic from corruption. He is zealous in protecting thisknowledge and unique adjustment for the prevention andadjustment of cause of human ills against the intrusion of other andinefficient methods. Although of a professional, rather than of a business trend of mind, he has full management of the business of the school. B. J. Palmer more than offsets any lack in business talent by his stirring enthusiasm and his painstaking attention to the welfare andprogress of students. His interest in graduates does not terminatewhen they leave the school, but continues until firmly establishedin the remunerative practice of Chiropractic, and as long as theycontinue such unmixed.HISTORICAL ______ The Rev. Samuel H. Weed, A. B., 1864, and A. M. 1867, of Indiana University, and B. D., 1867, of the U. P. Theo. Seminaryof the Northwest; also a member of the Co. K. 133 Regt., Ind., Vol.Inf., resides at Monmouth, Ill. Mrs. Weed and daughter took Chiropractic adjustments in 1896 and were much benefited, after which Mr. Weed also receivedadjustments for sciatica and was relieved. About this time he wasasked to suggest a name for the science and art. He simplytranslated the description of it, \"done by hand,\" into Greek, andthus originated the name Chiropractic. Mr. Weed, by receiving adjustments himself for various serious ailments, and observing closely the results of adjustments on manyothers, strongly endorses this most simple and efficient system andwill hail the day when poisonous drug treatments, needless painfulor torturous butchery, called surgery, is discarded and Chiropracticis universally adopted.Rev. Samuel H. WeedITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS A LIST OF GREEK WORDS. We are indebted to Rev. S. H. Weed for the following list of various words that have a relation or close bearing in meaning to\"Chiropractic.\" Xelpo The hand. Cheir, Kire. In composition\u2014Kiro. Cheirizo, Kiroizo, To handle, to perform an operation by hand (as in surgery). This would answer to describe hand treatment fordisease, and the following forms would naturally come from it: Chirism, Kirism, Handling, or performing an operation with the hand. Chirist,Kirist, One who practices bearing by hand, or advocates or believes in it. Cheirourgos, Kirurgos, A hand worker or hand operator, a surgeon, which latter is the same word after passing through the French into English. Thiswould be unsuitable, as it already has a fixed meaning in ourlanguage. Therapeuo, Therapeu, To cure, to attend. Therapeutic, therapeutist, and therapeutics are from this word. As they stand, it is understood that they meancuring or nursing with medicines, but with Chiro prefixed theycould not mean that. A Chirotherapeutic would be one who cureswith the hand. Chirotherapeutist, one versed in hand curing.Chirotherapeutics, the science of hand curing. Iatros, Eatros, A healer, a physician. 9THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Chiriatrus, Kiriatrus, A hand healer or hand physician. Chiriatric, One versed in, or adhering to, hand healing. Chiriatry, The science and art of hand healing. Katartizo,Katartizo, To adjust, put in order again, restore. Chirocatartist,Chirocatartister, One who adjusts or puts to right by hand; just the right meaning, but a jaw-breaker. Poieo, Poieo, To do or make. Chiropoiesis, The art of doing or forming by hand. Chiropoietic, Done or shaped by hand. Practos,Praktos, Done, to be done. Practor,Praktor, One who does or executes, a worker. Praxis, Doing, deed, practice. Chiropract,Chiropractic, Done by hand, or one that advocates or does hand practice. 10ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Chiropractor, A hand practitioner. Chiropractic, or Chiropraxis, orChiropraxy, The science and art of doing by hand. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 CHIROPRACTIC DEFINED. Historical\u2014 The first accidental crude Chiropractic adjustment of a vertebra was given in September, 1895, by Dr. D. D. Palmer.Neither the art, nor the science was formed at this time. Its growthremained practically dormant till 1903, since which time his son,B. J. Palmer, D. C., Ph.C., has developed it into a well definednon-therapeutical philosophy, science and art that has noresemblance whatever to any therapeutical method. Health(equality) is restored by completing the mental and physicalcircuit; restoring the currents of cycles of mental impulses actingthrough the material agency; to replace the full quota of positivewith an equivalent negative; permitting the reconveyance of theintelligent the mechanical corporeal; to reconstructthe psycho-physical unit; to make as one the triunity ofcreation, transmission and expression; to re-establish equilibriumbetween the abstract and concrete, all of which is induced byreplacing specific disordered concrete mechanical anatomy whichpermits adjustment between that one law of two principles\u2014causeand effect\u2014the rules and manner of declaration of which areunique and unlike any theories of stimulative or inhibitivemovements or applications used by any other school. Defined\u2014 Chiropractic is a name given to the study and application of a universal philosophy of biology, theology,theosophy, health, disease, death, the science of the cause ofdisease and art of permitting the restoration of the triunerelationships between all attributes necessary to normal compositeforms, to harmonious quantities and qualities by placing injuxtaposition the abnormal concrete positions of definitemechanical portions with each other, by hand, thus correcting allsubluxations of the three hundred articulations of the humanskeletal frame, more especially those of the spinal column, for thepurpose of permitting the re-creation of all normal cyclic currentsthrough nerves that were formerly not permitted to be transmitted,through impingement, but have now assumed their normal size andcapacity for conduction as they emanate through intervertebralforamina\u2014the expressions of which were formerly excessive orpartially lacking\u2014named disease. 11THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC All movements, whether normal or abnormal, of, or in the body (including blood circulation), are but the personification of mentalequivalents\u2014mental functions guided by Innate Intelligence,creating physical expression. All ache or pain is but the Intellectualinterpretation placed upon impressions received from the peripheryconcerning the abnormal physical conditions. Every act and thought is controlled by Innate Intelligence through the medium of the brains and their prolongations\u2014nerves\u2014to tissue. It is the life of the body when transformed in the brains. We are well when Innate Intelligence has unhindered freedom to act through the physical brain, nerves and tissues. Disease is a lack of normal functions.Innate mental impulses control the vital functions of assimilation, circulation and respiration, asleep or awake. Dreamsare sensations interpreted by the same discriminating force. Diseases are caused by a lack of current of innate mental impulses. This is produced by a constricting force placed around nerves through accidents\u2014vertebral subluxations. Thesedisplacements are caused by a concussion of forces, the external meeting the resistance of the internal, induced by traumatism. Chiropractors use the spinous and other processes as handles to adjust subluxations; by so doing they restore mental currents tonormal transmission\u2014and health exists. Chiropractor\u2014 One who knows the science, art and philosophy of Chiropractic and how to adjust subluxated vertebrae by placingin apposition the articular processes of the vertebral column. D.C. (Doctor of Chiropractic)\u2014The sign used to designate one who practices the philosophy, science and art of Chiropractic. Ph.C. (Philosopher of Chiropractic)\u2014The sign used to designate superior attainments in the study and practice of thephilosophy, science and art of Chiropractic. Treat\u2014(Webster)\u2014To care for medicinally or surgically; to manage in the use of remedies or appliances, to treat a disease, awound, or a patient. Adjust\u2014(Webster)\u2014To make exact; to fit; to make correspondent or comformable; to bring into proper relation. Adjustment\u2014 The name of the action of the Chiropractor when he adjusts \"into proper relation\" Innate Intelligence\u2014with itsphysical\u2014conforms the mental with its equivalent body\u2014reunitesthe mental and physical\u2014or restores one to the other. Luxation\u2014Where two articulating surfaces have wholly lost their proper connection. Subluxation \u2014Incomplete luxations, where articulating surfaces have in part lost their proper apposition. (For more thorough definitions see Vol. 3 of The Science of Chiropractic.) 12ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS PREFACE. The object of this book is, primarily, to assist in placing Chiropractic on a firmly scientific basis. We do not expect it to stand upon its literary merits; for if unsound in principle, felicity of diction cannot save it; if sound inprinciple, homeliness of expression cannot destroy it. Our primary object in compiling these writings and offering it to the public is in response to an immense demand thrust upon usfor the same, thus assisting to bring it within the domain of theexact sciences. In proportion as we gain knowledge of the cause of disease, we cease to treat effects. All therapeutists treat effects with remedies.Students may purpose learning the cause of disease to locate andadjust; may have the idea of adding Chiropractic to therapeuticremedies, but in proportion as they learn the cause of symptomsand how to adjust, the less they will use remedies. Chiropractic isnot a remedy. It is not treating effects by therapeutical remedies.Therapeutical remedies, be they hypodermic injection, suggestivetherapeutics, physical culture, magnetic treatment, or any othermeans used for the amelioration of diseased conditions, is ofsuperstitious origin. If it is better to know the cause and how to right it than to treat effects, why not learn all we can of the former and quit thinking of the latter? I aim to be liberal enough to agree that all modes of therapeutical treatment of disease have more or less effect uponthe symptoms, but we are not concerned about the methods oftreating effects, for we learn how to adjust the cause of allincoordinations in the body. The more you depend on therapeutical remedies and use them in treating effects, the slower you will be to accept Chiropracticand learn how to adjust the causes of diseases. In other words, themore you think of treating effects, the slower you will be to take inChiropractic. The more tenacious to the old, the less readily youabsorb the new. We do not blame you for selecting the best therapeutical remedy for diseased condition, for doing the best you could in thepast, but we do pity you and the world for not having sought afterand long ago found the cause of ailments. You, my students, have this book for the purpose of learning how to right the wrongs thatcause our ailments. If you desire to put brakes on the wheels ofprogress, to retard your development, and those with whom youcome in contact, continue to keep your minds, and others, filledwith remedies for symptoms. To take in a new idea you mustdestroy the old, must let go of old opinions, to observe andconceive new thoughts. To learn is but to change our opinion. 13THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC In conclusion, I desire to say that I claim no credit for this work other than that which is due to an honest scientific desire topromote the truth for its own sake. Sincerely believing in theabsolute correctness of Chiropractic principles, I have not hesitatedto follow it to its legitimate conclusion in every field which I havestudied.I am perfectly aware that many conclusions reached in these pagesare antipodal to preconceived ideas and for the purpose ofestablishing the individuality of Chiropractic, I publish them. B. J. PALMER, D. C., Ph. C. President, The Palmer School of Chiropractic (\"Chiropractic Fountain Head\"), Davenport, Iowa, U. S. A., 1906\u20141910\u20141917. 14ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS CHIROPRACTIC BRIEFS\u2014No. 1. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic is a science. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Drugs are a delusive snare. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Health is better than wealth. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 This book will make people think. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic is the study of Innate. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Analysis includes both science and art. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic is thoroughly American. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The doctor who has no patients, loses none. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The sick need, help, not drugs or incantations. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic is the product of independent thought. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Economy is one of the basic principles of Chiropractic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Better learn to adjust subluxations than to handle drugs. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 We have our idiosyncrasies. Chiropractic is one of them. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The human body should be repaired, not poisoned by drugs. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Observations are stepping stones on the plain of progress. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic is a distinct science, it is yet being developed. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The pathology of therapeutics, is not that of Chiropractic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic adjustments are attracting universal attention. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Adjusting shows the skill or awkwardness of the Chiropractor. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Pain is the mental interpretation of abnormal physical conditions. 15THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Chiropractic is hand adjustment, founded on mechanical principles. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Diathesis in etiology is a word without a meaning to a Chiropractor. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Why not learn to adjust the subluxations and help the disabled. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 We intend to give free rein to Chiropractic thoughts and expressions. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractors find subluxations which cause abnormal functions. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The time is coming when a drug store will be thought less of than a saloon. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 It appears that all nations have some form of home manual treatment. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The growth of Chiropractic has been in proportion to its individuality. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A knowledge of the principles of Chiropractic is necessary for success. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic seldom fails, and never does harm when properly handled. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractors adjust the cause of disease instead of treating effects. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 As a rule, doctors and lawyers run their business for what there is in it. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 M. D.'s rely largely on subjective symptoms; the Chiropractor on objective. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Sneers will not down facts; they are not weapons of a truly scientific mind. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Science is a knowledge; art is manifested in the ability to use that knowledge. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 There is no power in a bath, vibrators, or battery to replace a displaced joint. 16ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Some Chiropractor will advertise to teach Chiropractic by mail and fool many. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 We neither treat, knead, or manipulate our patients. We adjust subluxations. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The one who criticises lays a crown at the feet of the one whom he animadverts. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The Osteopaths use many movements for each disease, the Chiropractor but one. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractors trace a large share of ailments to the malalignment of vertebrae. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 This school does not ask you to believe anything that cannot be proven in the clinic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 We do not expect to please all. What is mental food for one is poison for another. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 When we are in perfect health, functions of nerves are performed in a normal measure. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Those who practice the science of Chiropractic are Chiropractors, not \"Chiropractics.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Adjusting the cause of disease ought to be substituted for treating the ailment. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 There is no effect without a cause. Chiropractors adjust causes, others treat effects. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Other schools are learning that diseases are nerve disorders, instead of blood poisons. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Physicians of any school are invited to call and see our unequaled pathological collection. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic is founded upon a correct knowledge of anatomy. It adjusts displacements. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Nerve impingement may cause inflammation in a bone or joint, the same as in softer tissue. 17THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Chiropractic does not derange the nervous system by causing abnormal functions, as do drugs. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 No worthier profession exists or offers so many opportunities for doing good as Chiropractic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractors have located the cause of neurotic diseases which have baffled the medical world. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic is the only science that exactly locates the cause of disease, and then adjusts it by hand. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Freedom of practice in the healing art is imperatively necessary for advancement and improvement. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The Chiropractor is not valued according to the amount of hard work he does, but by the skill employed. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The more clearly and forcibly we can impart the principles of Chiropractic, the better it is for our students. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Every physician and scientist who investigates Chiropractic says it is logical and in accordance with facts. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The people desire the doctor who is skilled in his profession. They have but little use or respect for a hybrid, \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 All the drugs in the world would not adjust a displaced joint, whether it be in the vertebral column or elsewhere. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The Chiropractor is presenting to his patients a system that is scientific, devoid of therapeutical experimenting. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The Osteopath accepts all of Allopathy, except that of drugs. Chiropractic assents to nothing that is Allopathic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic will revolutionize the old school methods which have treated disease for 2,000 years. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Loss of life does not come from Chiropractic adjustments; wish that we could say as much for surgical operations. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The people need light to protect themselves from the Germo- anti-toxin-Radi-Electric-Microbi-slush death producers. 18ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS The world's successful men,\u2014and those who are going to join the ranks, never say to themselves, \"I'll do it tomorrow.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The medical schools talk about \"ridding the body of disease\" as though it were something foreign that had to be driven out. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Many people tell us that they have tried everything, when the facts are, they have only used prescribed or patent medicines. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 No other profession offers such an opportunity to think, reason, investigate and discover new and valuable truths as Chiropractic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Stand by your principles, defend your rights, whatever comes of it. Nothing else in this world can bring you satisfaction in life. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Many remedies are positively injurious, others harmless, and some are decidedly a benefit, but is it not better to adjust the cause ? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A machine for the replacing of vertebrae is too much like using brute force. Better use Chiropractic, using the processes as levers. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Acute diseases demonstrate our success in practice. Where medicine requires weeks, the Osteopaths days, we ask only forminutes. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 In the near future, Chiropractic will be valued for its preventive qualities as much as for relieving and adjusting the cause ofailments. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 There are persons who would rather be killed by a regular in a customary manner than get well by an irregular in an unusualmanner. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic is not faith cure, Christian Science, magnetism, electricity, Osteopathy, hypnotism, massage or anything butChiropractic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 To comprehend what Chiropractic is, necessitates a knowledge of the principles of the science; wherein it differs from therapeutic schools. 19THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC If a vertebra or joint has been drawn or forced out of its normal position, why not replace it, instead of using a plaster or liniment? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The elastic cushions, named intervertebral cartilage, answer a similar purpose in the vertebral column as do buffers betweenrailroad coaches. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic knowledge cannot be rubbed in until the arthritic deposits in medical joints have been dissolved by browsing oncause and effect. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"Dietetics.\" When man has sufficient intelligence to build a child, then and not until then, can he dictate to Innate what andhow to \"diet\" the body. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 If you are sick use your reason, do not dose your stomach for a distress which is caused by some nerve being impinged, removethe pressure. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A Chiropractor is one who has acquired a knowledge of the science of Chiropractic and who is skilled in the art of adjustingvertebrae by hand. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Why does a physician prescribe for effects, symptoms, disease? Because he does not know the cause. If he did, he would adjust,instead of treating. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractors correct the mechanical displacements which cause derangements, thereby liberating impinged nerves, allowingnormal functions. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The P. S. C. will at all times take pleasure in showing those interested the difference between treating the effects and adjustingthe cause of disease. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Four hundred years before Christ, Iccus, and later Herodotus, applied bodily exercises and manipulations of the body to assist inrestoring health. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Regular physicians have caught on to the triumphant idea of combining strychnine with morphine, so as to irritate as well asdeaden the patient. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 When your spine is pliable, elastic and supple, you are young and buoyant. As your backbone stiffens, becomes rigid, andinflexible, you become old. 20ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS We do not use electricity, X-rays, drugs or anything else to treat the symptoms, but depend upon adjusting the wrong whichproduces the ailments. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The replacing of a vertebra may be accompanied by an audible sound when adjusted, or it may not be. We often replace vertebraewithout any noise. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Physicians are learning to give less drugs. They find that poisons are not suitable for the human body. They give a little tosatisfy their patients. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The Chiropractor asks for symptoms that he may locate the cause of the ailment. The medical man inquires about infection inorder to name the disease. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Cause and effect are not identical, the former always precedes the latter. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Under the guise of philanthropy and the public good, the people are required to patronize a privileged class of drug dosers, nomatter how distasteful. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Physicians desire to know the why, how and what about everything except disease. They reason upon all else, but insickness they seek only for relief. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The more medicine one takes, the more must be taken. The smaller amount taken, the less needed. If none is taken, it is soondiscovered that none is needed. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Humanity is losing faith in drugs. Why not, when the most eminent physicians in all ages have expressed a belief in theirunreliability and worthlessness? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic is radically different from all modes of healing. No one could expect to become acquainted with its principles byreading one or two leaflets. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The skeletal frame constitutes the stability of the human body just in proportion as its parts are in normal apposition, its healthycondition is unwavering. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Horses, after a hard day's work, desire to roll on the ground for the purpose of relieving tired muscles. It is to them what napravitis to the Bohemians. 21THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC A Chiropractor does not know an anterior subluxation. He comprehends what the Osteopath means by them, and knows howand why the mistake is made. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 From baby in the high-chair to grandma in the rocker, we are liable to accidents which displace some portion of our bonyframework, causing future disease. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Roots, herbs, drugs and minerals are used to treat the effects; they often produce other symptoms much worse than the diseasesthey are expected to cure. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Gradually the barriers of prejudice and ignorance are giving away. There is no longer thick ice to be broken. Chiropractic isknown for what it is worth. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chinese and Egyptian history shows that a system of healing not unlike what is now known as Manual Therapeutics, waspracticed centuries before Christ. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"Osteopathy includes all that is reliable in the therapeutics of medical science.\" Chiropractors do not include nor accept anythingthat is therapeutical or medical. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 One who dies under the treatment of an irregular causes much more comment by the regulars than many who die of the samedisease under the old-time dope dispenser. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Why search the world over for an exterminator or an antidote for disease? Why not look for the cause of our ailments in theperson afflicted and then correct it? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 While all articulations have a certain amount of play, the exceeding of this limit causes the cartilage to be torn from itscontiguous surface and subluxation to exist. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 All therapeutical schools direct their treatment, consisting of remedies, to the part of the body where abnormal functions aremanifested in symptoms, named disease. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Why use two or more systems, the principles of which are diametrically opposed to each other, in the theory and practice? Ifone is right in its doctrine, the other is wrong. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 It is useless to administer a powder, potion or pill to the stomach when the body needs adjustment. The jeweler shouldrepair the watch and not pour oil in the keyhole. 22ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Nothing is so wholesome as a clear conscience; remember that you may be able to get away from those whom you have wronged,but you can never get away from yourself. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Relief by morphine and strychnine is attended by a loss of sensation and reason; they offer a senseless palliation that blocksthe way of a correction\u2014and often causes death. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 There is no more resemblance between Chiropractic and Osteopathy than there is between the Franklin printing press of1720 and a three-deck Goss perfecting press. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"In acute diseases, can you always locate a subluxation causing the trouble?\" Yes, much more readily than in chronic cases. Thedesired results are more quickly realized. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The body is a living mechanical nerve machine, liable to be injured by accidents which may displace some portion of itsskeletal frame. Adjust, instead of trying to fix with noxious drugs. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic is scientific. It is in harmony with nature. It is but natural to fix the wrong, if we knew what and how. This newscience teaches the cause of disease and how to adjust it. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 It has taken many years of hard study to localize the cause of disease, and close application to develop this unique method ofadjusting vertebrae.. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 An Iowa Health Bulletin says: \"The next examination of physicians and osteopaths.\" A distinction being made between aphysician and an osteopath. An osteopath is not a physician. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The cause of disease is intelligible, the adjustments, though varied, are readily learned. Every move of a Chiropractor showsscientific intelligence, each move is made with a special aim inview. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 We believe in sanitation and hygiene, those remedial measures which have lessened many diseases of our childhood, therefore wehave a friendly feeling for all reform and harmless methods. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Disease is a material derangement and must have a material cause. Innate of itself is complete and perfectly capable of runningthe body. Disease being the manifestation of interference withtransmission. 23THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Chiropractic is not responsible for drug habits, but when properly handled, will correct subluxations which have beencaused by the continued use of strong drink, tobacco or morphine. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 All therapeutics, with very few exceptions, occupy the ridiculous position that malposition (subluxation) of the articularsurfaces of the joints, more especially of the vertebral column, donot exist. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractors can, in a measure, predict individual diseases, by an examination of the spinal column. To replace the subluxationswould be to remove the cause and prevent effects, called disease. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 People make a great ado if exposed to a contagious disease, but they submit to being inoculated with rotten pus, which, \"if ittakes,\" is warranted to give them a disease. \"What fools wemortals be!\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 There is as much difference between therapeutical methods, which use remedies to treat disease, and Chiropractic, whichadjusts the cause, as there is between a horse chestnut and chestnuthorse. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Investigators think the discovery of Chiropractic wonderful. We think it strange that M. D.'s, who for centuries have dissectedthousands of people, dead or alive, have never discovered thecause of disease. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 We can, by one adjustment, so change the symptoms of pneumonia, typhoid fever and other acute disease, that any M. D.would not recognize it as the same affection he had diagnosed fiveminutes before. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The sacral nerves pass through foramina of large size, therefore are not liable to be impinged, except in great distortions byfracture in adult life, displacements in youth, or by cordimpingements above. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The idea of poisoning healthy people with vaccine virus, inoculating them with one disease to prevent another, spreading itin a mild form, to protect the victim from a more serious attack, isirrational. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A physician of this city kindly offered to bring a spine to our office to show us a certain condition. He was not aware that wehave more vertebral columns than all the Iowa and Illinois doctorstogether. 24ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Chiropractors are opposed to poisoning any person, sick or well: therefore, we are opposed to vaccine virus, and the use ofdrugs as a curative measure, for they do not fix the wrong thatcauses the trouble. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Nature, Instinct, Subconscious Mind or Innate, has one fixed law of principle in all animal or vegetable matter. All living matter(and nothing is dead) is the demonstration of this fundamental law. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractors claim that when all parts of the skeletal frame are in proper apposition, there is health. That the bones may bedisplaced during sleep, or when we are awake, by accidents, orpoisons, is a proven fact. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Germs are scavengers. To charge them with being the cause of disease would be as unjust as it would be unfair to the streetscavenger to charge him with having produced the filth which he isengaged in removing. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 One who is not afraid to think has discovered a great truth, which staggered him for three months before he could comprehendthat he alone had found the cause of disease, that all other methodswere treating effects. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 It only brings the science of Chiropractic into disrepute to use remedies. The mixing of any drug or other agency withadjustment, for the treatment of disease, acts as a hindrance to theprogress of this science. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The Osteopaths work the body, in all its various parts, from fifteen minutes to an hour each treatment. The Chiropractorlocates the cause of the disease, then corrects the abnormalcondition by one move in one second. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractors have adopted the appendix, D. C. (Doctor of Chiropractic), which they feel proud of. They have no desire toannex M. D., for a full-fledged Chiropractor does not use drugs; hedoes not dose his patients. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Living tissue has a feeder which extends itself from feeding point to every brain cell by a path. It is a positive fact that diseasedoes not represent something wrong with the feeder but its methodof transportation. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Some one says, \"The wise man sells his knowledge.\" If he gave his knowledge away he would be a fool; and if he were a fool hewould have no knowledge at all. Ergo\u2014a man who gives away hisknowledge has none to give. 25THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC The Chiropractor readily traces tender, sensitive nerves from the affected part to the subluxated vertebra in the spine where theyare impinged, and vice versa. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Ray says: \"He that uses many words for explaining any subject doth, like the cuttle fish, hide himself for the most part in his ownink.\" The Chiropractor, therefore, will try to tell what he has to sayin as few words as possible. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Practitioners just opening an office, and especially since they use an unknown method, get chronic cases which others haveabandoned, but in time they secure their share of the acute cases,which respond more quickly. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The road with the deepest rut is the most used. Chiropractors have built a new highway that has no ruts. Be careful,Chiropractors, lest we get into some of the old ruts made by otherschools. You find it difficult to rid yourself of habit. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A human being, like inanimate machines, should be examined occasionally. If any part is found displaced, adjust it, using asmuch good sense in doing so as you would in repairing a watch,organ or steam engine. \"A stitch in time saves nine.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 When an M. D. speaks of \"luxations of the spine,\" he refers to a complete separation of the articular processes. A Chiropracticsubluxation is a partial separation of two articular surfaces, whichare readily replaced by the hands of a Chiropractor. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 D. S. Maddox, M. D., says in Medical Brief that \"It is the consensus of opinion among the liberal element of the medicalprofession that no medical laws at all would be far better thanthose which now disgrace the statute books of most of the states.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 There are hundreds of ways by which the joints of the skeletal frame are displaced, among which are slips, falls, strains, lifts,jerks, jars, concussions, the many poisons from decaying animaland vegetable matter, and those administered by physicians. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractors find subluxations that obstruct natural functions. Physicians look for obstructions in the fluid channels, give thestomach a dose, expecting it to hunt up the obstacle, clear thecanals, retard or accelerate the circulation of the fluids. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Physiology is but the science of functions. Human physiology deals with functions of the human body. Pathological physiologyis morbid functions. Functions performed abnormally createconditions known as disease. Normal functions mean health. 26ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS In the December number, 1905, of Journal of Osteopathy a writer says: \"This bone (the innominatum) has caused the writermore worry and anxiety than any other piece of osseous structureof the body.\" Chiropractors have less trouble with ossa innominatathan any of the vertebrae. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 For a Chiropractor to injure one person, even to the causing of piles, is awful and should prevent many from going to them. Butthe killing of hundreds in the hospitals seems to have a fascinatinginfluence on others, who are not only willing but anxious to havean operation performed. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic came into existence through a combination of circumstances which made surrounding environments of such anature that it could no more help being born than you or I. Such acoalition of conditions never did occur before; if they had, then itwould have been discovered prior to 1895. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 If you would be a man, not a flunky, do not put on the degrading livery of mental slavery which organizations keep fortheir members. The man who is true, who has merit, must have hisown opinions, must speak his own mind, and live his own life.People know this, and judge accordingly. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A Chiropractor has no use for remedial agencies, nor the laboratory, to examine sputum, bile, urine, feces, blood and serum,just to, show the resultant conditions. It is the desire of theChiropractor to adjust the cause of these derangements, nameddisease, then there will be no need of treating effects. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Man is a machine, one of the most wonderful ever created. Like all others, it is liable to have some portion displaced. Whynot secure a human machinist who understands the cause ofdisease, a man who can detect and adjust that which is out ofalignment? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 We inherit family peculiarities, not only in outward shape, facial expression, etc., but in our internal expansion of bones,nerves and blood vessels; for be it remembered that no two of usare any more alike in our osseous and soft tissues than in ourexternal form. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractors do not combat disease. They do not look upon it as an enemy that must be fought, conquered and vanquished, butthe result of misfortune, as we would that of distress from afractured bone or a displaced joint. The injured need ourassistance and sympathy. 27THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Nature makes no repetitions. Similarity there is, but never absolute likeness. This is nowhere so forcibly illustrated as in thespinal column, of which we handle many. There are no two ofthem alike. No one vertebra in one spinal column will fit in theplace of another. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Heretofore, all modes of healing have, looked upon blood as the life of the body. The Chiropractor says it is expressed by mentalimpulse; all fluids are propelled by mental force.; the heat of thebody, whether normal, too much., or not enough, is the result ofmental impulse. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 We adjust vertebral curvatures by hand, never by a machine. We never stretch the spine by any means whatever. Wedge-shapedvertebrae make curvatures. These must be returned gradually totheir former shape. To do this there is much to be taken intoconsideration. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"Self-reliance is the salt of life which seasons all things and makes them good.\" The man who has self-reliance is free, happyand successful. Whatever reverses or misfortunes may overtakehim he has the fortitude to meet them, the strength and habit ofmind to get on his feet and recover lost ground. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 There are many who claim to practice Chiropractic who know but little or nothing of it. It is therefore the purpose of this bookand the parent school to teach this modern science unmixed.Those who desire to practice it with other methods have a right todo so, but they should not call the mixture Chiropractic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The causes of vertebral displacements are many; they may occur while awake or asleep. Any force that will separate thearticular surfaces, be that a wrench or the insidious displacement,which has its source in any one of the many poisons of decayingvegetable and animal matter, or that of drugs, will subluxate thevertebrae. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 To force people to choose a doctor they do not want is to interfere with their liberty and individual rights. When humanliberty is restricted for any pretext whatever, there is danger andtrouble ahead. It brings the majesty of law into disrepute,demoralizes the community in which unjust laws are enforced andincites a rebellious spirit. 28ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS The developer of this new science has well-defined ideas to follow, which were Chiropractic (fixing by the hand). A malletand stick to drive vertebrae into place, a machine to screwstubborn seventh cervical down, a towel wrapped around the body,a person walking on the back, is not Chiropractic, is not adjustingthe vertebrae by hand. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Is not our literature comprehensive? Are not our statements plain? Do we not draw the line of demarcation closely? Do wetell our readers understandingly what Chiropractic is, and whereinit differs from other methods? If so, why do many persons think ithypnotism, magnetic, massage, osteopathy, or that which is knownas nature cure? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 We have made many people well who had rheumatism, and so have other Chiropractors, in less than a minute, by taking offpressure from nerves. Do you think for one moment that theadjustment changed the elements in the blood in that moment?Rheumatism is not a blood disease. Chiropractors are dailyproving this bloody delusion to be untrue. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Disease is excessive or insufficient performance of functions. The Indian said that the white man looked like a loaf of bread notbaked; the colored man, like a loaf all burnt black; but the Indianwas just right, just baked brown. Health is a happy medium, whennerve functions are formed just right, neither too much nor notenough. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 In the present advanced stage of knowledge pertaining to subluxations of the vertebral column, there is no necessity forpulleys, straps, hooks, traction tables, mallets, and chisels, oranatomical adjusters. As Chiropractic becomes recognized andunderstood, these contrivances are looked upon as objects ofcuriosity and implements of torture. They will cease to be used byintelligent people and be associated with those of the old SpanishInquisition. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 It is just as difficult to teach the essential principles and adjustment of Chiropractic to a doctor as others. It takes months tolearn to adjust under a personal instructor. The student must beshown the abnormal in the patient and a corresponding specimenselected from our pathological collection. Then there are manyvariations and conditions to be learned. Chiropractic cannot be taught by mail to any person, be he a doctor or not. 29THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC When mental impulses of the thorax and pelvis are diminished they allow the internal organs to drop down, to become displaced,prolapsed, producing hernia, piles, prolapsus uteri and otherdiseased conditions. Why not look for the cause of suchweaknesses? The taking of the pulse, temperature, respiration andan examination of the tongue and secretions will not locate thecause. Spinal analysis is worth much more to a Chiropractor. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Doctors like to experiment. They prescribe water, salt and the most deadly drugs, or stick a knife into you with as muchindifference as you used to when skinning rabbits. Their chargesrun from two dollars a prescription to five hundred a rip. If anymedicine contains deadly drugs the public has a right to know it.This rule should hold good in doctor's prescriptions, as well aspatent medicines. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 There is really no such thing as curing any disease. We do not cure or heal ailments. It is a misstatement, of which all well-informed M. D.'s are aware. Chiropractors adjust that whichcauses distress (disease). When the skeletal frame is norm al, thefunctions are performed in a natural manner, consequently nodisease (not-ease). To cure or heal is one of the Allopathicsignboards which has become so fixed on the mental vision that itis difficult to change. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The medical man waits for symptoms to fully develop that he may determine the disease of the patient. The Chiropractordecides upon his first visit what portion of the spine has beendisarranged by a wrench or absorbed poison, then replaces thedisplaced part to its normal position. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 It is sickening to read of bacteriological experiments. Excretory and secretary fluids are taken from live and deadanimals; poisonous drugs, decayed tissues, purifying andfermenting mixtures are stirred up with the most dangerous animalpoisons known. These are examined with the hope that they maylearn the cause of disease. These microbe hunters are at the wrongend of the string. Chiropractors are looking for causes.Bacteriologists are examining effects. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A Partnership.\u2014\"I called at Dr. Physic's office one day,\" relates a gentleman, \"and I found one of the most noted sexton-undertakers lying on a settee, waiting for the return of the doctor.The easy familiarity of his position, and the perfect 'at-homeativeness' led me to say, 'Why, Mr. Plume, have you goneinto partnership with the doctor?' 'Yes,' he replied, as he raisedhimself up, 'we have been together some time; I always carry thedoctor's work borne when it is done.'\" 30ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS James Copeland, M. D., F. R. S., in Practical Medicine, date 1844, upon disease of the liver, says: \"Being aggravated and theconstitutional powers injured by the empirical and routine practiceof bleeding, mercurializing, over-dosing and over-drugging; andalthough these practices are less remarkable now than twenty orthirty years ago, they are still notorious, and furnish arguments forthe knaves of Homeopathy, of Hydropathy, and of other kinds ofhumbug, to assail the public mind.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The physically hampered mind is unable to express itself in natural manifestations. \"Second childhood\" is a lack of brainforce; the mind's dependence upon nervous structure for self-expression is not complete; a lack of mental coordination; the mindcannot do more than give the distorted messages from Innate orEducated Intelligence. A person might be very intellectual, buthandicapped by deafness, loss of sight, or when one \"has a cold,\"he appears and feels a little off, in fact, dull. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Journal of Osteopathy says: \"The entire system strengthened against further attacks of disease.\" Osteopathy, like Allopathy,believes disease to be an enemy, which may attack and overpowerus, if our system is not fortified against it. Chiropractors do notlook upon disease in any such light. They consider ailments asresults of accidents which disarrange the bony framework of thebody. Wherein is there any resemblance between Osteopathy andChiropractic? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Could we but fancy the main shaft of a machine capable of the various movements of the vertebral column and subject it to thesame number of twists and wrenches that the spine has to endure,we would no longer be astonished when shown so many vertebraeby Chiropractors that have slipped out of place. Is not the humanbody much more liable to have its parts racked out of their properposition and the resultant consequence more severe and reachingthan that of an inanimate machine? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Medical Brief, page 489, says: \"Every day I become more and more convinced that symptoms and not disease should be treated.\"Disease is but disturbed functions. It is a name given to acollection of symptoms. To describe a disease is to name thesymptoms and effects that constitute the ailment. To treatsymptoms instead of disease would be to give a remedy for eachinstead of all the different phases named disease. TheChiropractor would find the cause of disturbed functions. 31THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC The Chiropractic science is not the practice of medicine. The two are diametrically opposite. They are antipodal. That of givingmedicine is of ancient date. No medical schools have ever taughtthe principles of Chiropractic. In fact, they do not believe inadjustments. Medical men look to the blood and germs as cause ofdisease. Chiropractors to nerves being impinged between osseoustissue. Chiropractic has met serious opposition from the medicalmen, who have old time ideas. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The P. S. C. has spent thirty thousand dollars and years of time collecting its museum of osteological specimens. This varied andimmense aggregation has been the means and a necessity indiscovering the cause of disease and in developing the science. It is equally as indispensable to students in receiving instruction in the principles of this accumulated and established knowledgewhich has been systematized and formulated into a science of which our graduates are qualified to judge. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic is a combination of two Greek words, which means done by the hand; a hand practitioner, one who repairs,adjusts; as used by Chiropractors it means the replacing ofarticular surfaces that have been slightly displaced. Walking onthe back, using a towel around the chest as a tourniquet, a malletand stick to drive the projecting vertebrae in line, general and localtraction, screwing down a stubborn seventh cervical vertebra withthe anatomical adjuster, is not hand adjusting, is not Chiropractic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 What is the factor that changes conditions named disease to that of health? Innate Intelligence is the director, the mover, in thistransaction. An M. D. looks after the disease, and prescribes acertain treatment for it. He may find the kidneys, liver or pancreasnot performing their functions properly, but no matter, the dose isprepared for and given to their neighbor, the stomach. TheChiropractor finds what organ is not doing its duty, then, instead oftreating a well one, finds the cause of derangement and adjusts it. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The new era will be free of the pharmacist whose occupation is to use the pestle and mortar compounding various drugs; the patentmedicine venders who have encompassed the earth to find the mostpoisonous and loathsome plants, the bodies, entrails and feces ofinsects and animals, each of which has been made to contribute asa dose for the stomach of suffering men, women and children.But, thanks to the power of man's understanding, the doom ofpoisonous medicines and vile drugs has been written in one magicword\u2014Chiropractic. 32ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Medical Standard, under \"Adversity Makes Strange Bed- fellows,\" says: \"Two Mexican students have discovered that thetapeworm prevents the organism from being infected withtuberculosis bacilli. To establish the efficiency of the remedy thephysicians injected the live cure into several patients, all of whomrecovered.\" The tapeworm eats the tuberculosis bacilli. That is theAllopathic conception of ridding the body of disease. War, A fighton hand. One disease to combat another. Allo\u2014one and pathy\u2014disease. One disease for another. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Opium, administered by the physician, has been the means of deathbed recantations, and has assisted the treacherous hand of thewill distorter. The changes made in deeds, wills and importantpapers by sick people are often due to mental maudlin, artificiallysentimental, their minds easily moved. Courts should set aside allwills and codicils drawn by such subjects. Upon proof that themaker or remodeler of important papers had been drugged bystrychnine or morphine, whether by mouth or hypodermicinjection, such papers should be ignored. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Displacements of the 300 articular joints, more especially the fifty-two of the vertebral column, are not always caused by violentinjuries or accidents. There may be poisons in the food we eat, thewater we drink, or the air we breathe, which affects the sensorynerves; these abnormal sensations cause motor mental impulses tocontract muscles which draw the articular surfaces awry. Nomatter how they are displaced, the Chiropractor sees fit to replacethem in their normal position. When perfect relationship is re-established, health is the inevitable result. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Visitor.\u2014\"You must have a remarkably efficient Board of Health in this town.\" Shrewd Native.\u2014\"You are right about that, I tell you.\"\"Composed of scientists, I presume?\"\"No, sir. Scientists are too theoretic.\"\"Physicians, perhaps?\"\"Not much. We don't allow doctors on our Board of Health\u2014no, sir\u2014nor undertakers, either.\" \"Hum! What sort chosen, then?\"\"Life insurance men.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Churns of many forms have been used for centuries to separate the casein, which is afterwards formed into cheese and butter; buta man who had the \"persistent courage, acquisitive combativeness,approbativeness and executiveness\" claims to have made a newdiscovery of separating the casein from the 33THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC milk by a machine he named \"The Separator.\" Should the old mossbacks persist in saying that \"it is nothing new\" although itmade as great an innovation in the art of butter making as hasChiropractic over the old methods of Osteopathy, Massage,Swedish movements and Napravit? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Between intervertebral notches are nerves which convey mental impulses which perform the various functions of the body. Whenthe intervertebral cartilage becomes condensed, less elastic andthinner, the vertebrae are drawn closer together, occluding theforamina, slightly impinging nerves, causing a lack of functionalforce; vigor is impaired, and in proportion old age advances. If wekeep our vertebrae separated, movable and free, age stiffness willbe eliminated. We have been taught to observe effects; the realcause\u2014closed joints\u2014have not been noticed by the medicalworld. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The Chiropractor takes the disordered mechanism of man, and, by properly adjusting the deranged parts, allows impulses toperform their natural functions. The medical man clogs itsmachinery with mysterious mixtures and finally turns it over to thesurgeon to complete the work of destruction. We believe thatdisease is the result of anatomical abnormalities (bones slightlydisplaced by various accidents) which cause physiological discordand abnormal functions. Therefore, to return to health, free thebody of pain and distress, we replace the displaced parts of thenerve machine in their proper position. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 They tell me it does not pay to tell the truth; that when a patient asks, \"How long will it take to adjust my cause?\" the doctor shouldstate some certain length of time to appease their consciences. Itdoes not pay, from what point of view\u2014financial? The financialpoint is not everything. Be honest with your conscience first; if so,you cannot be dishonest with the other fellow. I pity the man thathas so little honest decision, who, before saying a word, catcheshimself, slaps his hand on his mouth, and stops to meditate, \"Willit pay to tell the truth?\" What's the odds\u2014more truth, morebusiness\u2014we are not going to live forever. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Looking over our immense vertebral collection, which is the largest in existence, we find caries limited, as a rule, to the bodiesand articular processes. The laminae, transverse and spinousprocesses are rarely affected. Various reasons have been assignedby many authors, but none were satisfactory until we discoveredthat heat production was controlled by mental 34ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS impulses. Excessive heat softens bone and produces caries. Articular and intervertebral cartilages being good conductors ofsurplus heat, explains why the articular and intervertebralcartilages become fibrilated, disintegrated, and the adjacent partsof the bodies affected by caries. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 We have neither a \"process of treating disease,\" nor a \"method of treatment.\" Instead of treating the disease, we adjust that whichproduces it. In place of a \"method of treatment,\" we bring theabnormal parts to a true relative position. A Chiropractic lessonmay help to explain the difference between adjusting and treating.I had a case containing pathological specimens, the doors of whichdid not close properly. When shown the trouble, a student at oncesaid, \"Shave off the sides of the doors, so they will close.\" Ireplied, \"That is Allopathy. We will use Chiropractic.\" Weleveled the case, adjusted it, then the doors were O. K. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The brain sends its messages through the spinal cord to all parts of the body. The spinal marrow passes down through the spinalcanal; it consists of nerves which convey mental impulsesefferently, and tactile impressions efferently. They branch outfrom the spinal cord in all directions, absolutely controlling everypart of the anatomy. So potent is this control that all action,whether normal or abnormal, is absolutely dependent upon thecondition of the nerves radiating from the spine. A wrench of thevertebral column displacing the two movable notches which formthe foramina invariably leads to some disturbance of that portion towhich the nerves proceed and end. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 There are 310 mechanical movements known to workmen; all are modifications of those found in the human body. In thismachine are all the levers, joints, pulleys, pumps, pipes, wheelsand axles, balls and sockets, beams, girders, trusses, buffers,arches, columns, cables, and supports known to science. Man'sbest mechanical works are but adaptations of processes found inthe human body\u2014a revelation of the first principles used in naturalphilosophy. Why not learn something of the use and the disuse ofthese mechanical movements? Why not use as good judgment inadjusting this piece of machinery as we do the inanimate? If youcannot use pulleys, then learn to use levers and bars. 35THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Be grand in purpose, brave in act, As you and truth decide it;Swift in defense, slow in attack,Then, what the issue, bide it!If opposition bar your track,Don't turn, but override it.Stand close to all, but lean on none,And if the crowd desert you,Stand just as fearlessly aloneAs if a throng begirt you,And learn what long the wise have known,Self-flight alone can hurt you. WILLIAM S. SHURTLEFF . \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Did you ever hear of a symptom or an ailment being fixed or adjusted? It is impossible to adjust or fix illness or complaints.You cannot adjust a malady or disease. You cannot adjust effects.You can learn to adjust the cause of sickness. Symptoms,ailments, complaints, disorders, illness, indisposition, malady,sickness or disease may be treated, but not adjusted. You cannottreat causes. They must be made right\u2014adjusted. Why should aChiropractor say that he treats a person for an ailment, simplybecause of custom? Custom has always treated diseases. We havealways talked about treating, because we never knew anythingabout adjusting the cause of symptoms. The P. S. C. has broken away from custom and so may you. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Medical Brief says: \"It is the experience of every practitioner that drugs do not have the same effect on all individuals. Theseidiosyncrasies are not only peculiar to the individual, but runthrough whole families. Just why certain drugs do not act as wellin these cases is not known, but the fact must be taken intoconsideration.\" Just why the same drug does not have the sameeffect upon one person as upon another is perplexing to physicians.There are no two individuals alike in any respect. We are radicallydifferent in the quality and sensibility of our nerves. All drugs areforeign substances and more or less poisonous to our bodies.Innate Intelligence takes cognizance of the fact, but, for variousreasons, does not always use the same method of force to removethe intruder. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 There's a worth in Chiropractic That is even more than gold. It is like the first love story\u2014 Better experienced than told. 36ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS One lies in easy position; The next he hears a click; He feels the pain has vanished, And relief has come that quick. The world needs Chiropractors\u2014 Needs them on every hand. For those in pain and anguish, This is a weary land. Then let us strive to be masters In this art that we employ; To make the whole world better, And more full of peace and joy. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Do you believe in a Supreme Being? Do you believe in a Perfect Supreme Being? Do you believe that this perfect Supreme Being could do an imperfect thing? Could you suggest one thingthat He does that could be improved? Could you suggest animprovement to be added to a new-born babe? Does man make asingle article, tool, instrument, etc., perfect or does he add oneimprovement after another? Innate is perfect, makes perfectbodies, trees, bushes, animals, in fact, all which has life is thehandiwork of Him. These objects are perfect, complete, at time ofbirth. If anything was added it would be a drag. If an organ, tissueor muscle was taken from the body, just so much would thegeneral metabolism be interfered with, for the missing organswould fail to do their share of work. Believing that Innate isperfect, if man removes any organ he is to that extent denying theability of Him who created, to do things perfect. Is he denying theability of Him to do things as they ought? If a man be a true Christian he must know of the all wisdom of the Creator, nor must he criticise to the extent of destroying any part of His works. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 In every newspaper we're sure to find gush about the man behind the counter and the man behind the gun; The man behind the buzz saw and the man behind his son;The man behind the times and the man behind his rents;The man behind his plowshare and the man behind the fence;The man behind the whistle and the man behind the bars;The man behind the kodak and the man behind the cars;The man behind his whiskers and the man behind his fists;And everything is entered on the lists. But they've skipped another fellow, of whom nothing has been said\u2014 The fellow who is even or a little way ahead, 37THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Who always pays for what he gets, whose bills are always signed\u2014 He's a blamed sight more important than the man who is behind.All merchants, and the whole commercial clan,Are indebted for existence to this honest fellow-man.He keeps us all in business, and the town is never dead;We take off our hats to the Chiropractic man who is ahead. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 IF YOU ONLY KNEW You would have no grim forebodings Of the symptoms called disease,You would cease to keep your childrenClose confined and hear them teaseTo enjoy the pleasant pastimesThat to every child is dear;You would have no fear of feversThat are sometimes lurking near, If you only knew. You would have no anxious moments With diphtheria cards next door;You would laugh at coughs and measles,And the many ills in store.You would strive to teach your neighbors,As you witness their distress,That these ills are only triflesCaused by accidents\u2014no less, If you only knew. You would smile at pangs of toothache, And neuralgic pains so sore;You would dread the gout and cancers,And rheumatism never more.;You would lie upon your pillowAnd indulge in perfect rest,If you had heard of Chiropractic,And had seen successful tests\u2014 If you only knew. You would fear no germs or microbes, Or their power to seal your fate;You would dwell in sweet content,When adjustments close the gate,You would know that these contagionsThat were taught to you for years,Are but myths and allegoriesTo the Chiropractor's ears\u2014 If you only knew. 38ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS You would feel that life's worth living, In this blessed land of ours;You would revel in the sunshine,And the fragrance of the flowers;You would love to win your neighborFrom the error of his ways,And thank God for Chiropractic,And the joys of healthy days\u2014 If you only knew. L. H. NUTTING. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 PATHS OF PROGRESS A youth starting out in life, Ambitious to win fame,Decided to affix M. D.To ornament his name.He chose the Path his father trod,And studied night and day;He soon was giving poisoned drugs,The same old-fashioned way , An Allo-path. If morphine pills and calomel Were good enough for Dad,It didn't suit his customers;He found their action bad.He entered a more modern school,Which \"high deglutions\" taught,Traveling on a broader pathWhere many cures were wrought\u2014 A Homeo-path. Ever ready for new thoughts, And losing faith in pills,He found a more progressive pathA sure cure for ills.He gave up drugs entirely, andIs now in great demand;He doesn't give prescriptions now,But does it all by hand\u2014 An Osteo-path. Progression seems to be his forte, He studied water cure,And uses \"Nature's medicines\u2014Sun, air, and water pure\";And all these paths have taught him this.The best one in the land\u2014That Nature is the Doctor, andTo know and understand\u2014 A Hygeo-path. 39THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC H. L. Nutting thinks the following two verses should be added to bring the paths of progress up to Chiropractic: Yet still he seemed dissatisfied, He wore an anxious mien;For yet, withal, his patients died!He fixed not the machine!Ah! He learns the cause\u2014Luxations to adjust\u2014And now he deals with Nature's Laws,In Chiro puts his trust\u2014 A Healthy-path. And evermore he is the one That overcomes the ills,Known now to be but accidents,That pain the body fills;He finds the cause, nor air nor sun,But bones just out of place;With Chiro hand the work is done,Disease then leaves no trace\u2014 A Chiro-path. B. D. S TILLMAN, Chicago, Ill. 40ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS A PHILOSOPHY GROWS AS ITS CO-RELATED DISCOVERIES AND INVENTIONS INCREASE No science bursts forth complete on its first formulation. It must make, its slow advance from fact to theory and hypothesis,thence back to more facts to be explained by the same theory, or asamended or new theory. No science is ever a completed one, because new facts, new relations, and new phenomena are forcing themselves uponconsciousnesses, seeking for classification and explanation inconformity to the laws under which they exist. COMPARISON. Science is Classified, Systematized Knowledge. It consists of the description and formulation of phenomena and their causal relations. Science is knowing. Art is Applied Knowledge. It is the systematized adaptation of means to ends. To satisfy man's Needs and Desires. It is Nature affected by man's will forspecific ends. Art is doing. Philosophy is the intelligence gained by the relation of the laws which science bears to art and the powers that cause creation, generation,propulsion, transmission and expression, or personification ofboth. Philosophy is Intelligence. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 CHIROPRACTIC BRIEFS NO. 2. We need wide-awake, up-to-date Chiropractors. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The history of heretics marks the progress of humanity. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Art and Science have no enemies but those who are ignorant. 41THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC The advancement of the world was never made upon sandy bases. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Take away his educated senses by impingement and he is an imbecile. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Ambition is torment enough for an enemy. Success makes him rage. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The supreme use of our ideals is to have a noble purpose and to stick to it. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The man who has ideas can tell them. It does not take an English scholar to tell what he thinks. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Be comprehensive, yet concise. Brevity insures lucidity. Chiropractic is all of the above. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The adjusting of the cause of disease ought to be substituted in the place of treating the ailment. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 All sciences are rapidly advancing. The impossibilities of today are being made possible tomorrow. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Man cures nothing. Innate does the restoring when able to perform functions in a normal manner. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The entire assortment of drugs are injurious to mankind. This is becoming patent to people generally. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The large-souled man may be both blessed and cursed, but scorn and approval does not change his purpose. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A good idea poorly and bluntly expressed is of more value than a teacher having no ability to tell what he don't know. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Call it persistence, tenacity, perseverance\u2014call it what, you will\u2014it is the touchstone that brings out all the best forces. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The time is at hand when the cause of diseases will be adjusted. The treatment of effects will soon be a thing of the past. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Medical men have searched the world for remedies, desiring an antidote. Chiropractors find the cause in the person ailing. 42ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Science is knowledge; art is manifested in the ability we have of using that knowledge. Analysis includes both science and art. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 It is character that counts. Wealth, position and education without it but make weakness the plainer and individual defects themore glaring. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 It is the people who think and suffer, who aspire and perspire; they are the ones who originate, develop and carry forward all realprogress. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Taking the temperature, pulse, respiration, examining the tongue, feces and urine, does not locate the displacement of thebony framework. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.\" Wheat does not grow from sunflower seeds, nor morning glories fromgrunts and groans. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The old idea, that of treating effects, is built upon educational intensified ignorance. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A person may be very intellectual, but, handicapped by deafness, loss of I sight, or when he \"has a cold,\" he appears andfeels a little off, in fact, dull. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A Chiropractor analyzes the effects of disease to cause. What would be the most appropriate name for a lady Chiropractor? AnnElizar (Analyzer). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Many children, because of some prenatal or postnatal defect, study to a disadvantage as the result of nerve impingements, whichderange functions. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The Chiropractor readily traces tender, sensitive nerves from the affected part to the displaced vertebra in the spine where theyare impinged, and vice versa. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Strong characters are calm and deliberate. They can hurry and be noisy, if need be in an emergency, but they usually forestallemergencies by forethought. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The American Post-Graduate School says of Chiropractic: \"This is not Osteopathy, but a new science of manipulationrelieving nerve strain.\" 43THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC To contend, to wrestle, to find occasion for putting forth our strongest efforts; these are what bring both the man and the nationto their fullness and completeness. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Moses had our \"spontaneous life,\" scientists beaten to a finish when he, without \"culture,\" covered the land of Egypt with liceand frogs, fully developed, in one night. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 I hold it true that thoughts are thingsEndowed with being, breath and wings,And that we send them forth to fillThe world with good results, or ill. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic analyzes effects, thus proving its cause. Medical men and Osteopaths always diagnose effects to give them a name;the medicine or treatment is given accordingly. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 When we have divested Innate Intelligence of the mysteries with which ignorant men have invested it in the past, we will thenbe on the unobstructed road to intellectual progress. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractors adjust displacements of the bones, relieve pressure from nerves so that they can perform their functions in anormal manner. Then Innate can and will do the rest. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The professional theologian has always been the greatest enemy to the progress of theology. The professional doctor has alwaysbeen the worst enemy to the progress of medicine. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Watch the man who readily agrees with you. Put him upon the \"suspicious list.\" He agrees to toady to you or he has no mind ofhis own, either instance being sufficient to cast him aside. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The new science of Chiropractic uses no drugs nor other remedies for those diseased conditions, it adjusts the wrongs, thedisplacements that cause those afflictions that we name disease. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic Trophic Nerves. Trophic nerves carry impulses which, upon action, convert nutritive substances into cellassimilation. They do not carry nourishment, but act as aconverter. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Knowledge applied is success. The man without it complains. The one with it continues to forge ahead. He is not the onebegging for state protection. Equal ability meets the same level. 44ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS A light pressure on nerves in the intervertebral foramina will cause them to become inflamed, swollen and contracted. Heavypressure, loss of heat, a lax condition, and a shrinkage of nerves. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The cause of disease has been sadly overlooked and neglected. Chiropractic has opened up this line of new thought which isfundamental to all that is vitally related to the welfare of humanculture. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 All movable articulations are surrounded by synovial membranes, which secrete a viscid fluid, resembling the white ofan egg. Its use is to lubricate the joints and the sheaths in whichtendons play. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The demarcation between instinct and reason is speculative. Instinct has been defined as \"subconscious memory,\" aremembrance of the way things have been done during manyprevious generations. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"Vibrators.\" The question comes at once to a Chiropractor, \"Is it possible to adjust a, complete displacement, or a subluxatedvertebra with a vibrator? If not, what use has a Chiropractor for avibrator?\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic is not quantity, but quality. The Osteopaths average a hundred moves in each treatment; whereas,Chiropractors give one adjustment instead. Osteopathy is general.Chiropractic is specific. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 First, obey your conscience; then the laws made by man. The highest form of obedience is to one's own convictions of right andwrong. Whenever the dictates of conscience conflict with law,disobedience becomes a virtue. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The Chiropractor desires Light instead of Darkness: Reason, in place of Superstition; Science preferred to Tradition; IInvestigation and Enlightenment better than Credulity andIgnorance; Liberty than Slavery; justice not Privilege. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The world evolves around the actions of man. His success depends upon vitality and power. He must have health toaccomplish this. Backbone must be normal. Chiropractors, whengenerally supplied, will improve the world's output. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The person who takes a doctor's dope without knowing what it is, what the doctor expects, if to do, why it will do it, what it istaken for, and what food or drink is incompatible with it, is achump. 45THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Physicians have but little confidence in their own prescriptions, so much of it depends upon faith that when they are ailing, and abrother physician prescribes, they prefer not to know theingredients of the prescription. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"Second childhood\" is a lack of mental impulses. The mind's dependence upon nervous structure for. self-expression is notcomplete; a lack of mental coordination; the mind cannot do morethan give the distorted messages from Innate or Educated mind. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"Cause and Cure.\" A cause must be adjusted, corrected, fixed, set right, made right. To \"cure'' you must treat effects, applysomething to the results. Therein lies the greatest transformingvalue of Chiropractic; it adjusts causes, but does not treat effects. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Death is looked upon as an enemy. It is a transition, a change of residence and conditions. If such did not exist the lot of theafflicted would be awful. The passing from this stage of existenceto another is a blessing. If there were no death' there would be noneed of the Christian religion. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The practitioner and the layman are not to blame for using the words \"treat\" and \"treatment,\" for they have known nothing elsebut the various methods of treating. Chiropractors do not treat thegoitre. They find the cause and take off the pressure from thenerve, whose functions are exaggerated. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Different symptoms present themselves in different persons from the Chiropractic subluxation. The same symptoms may bepresent in different people from different subluxations. Thereforewe cannot make a chart, key or index giving \"Chiropractic centers.A student must learn to trace affected nerves from the diseasedportion to the place impinged or vice versa. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Hill, the noted railroad man, was asked what studies or work he would advise a young man to take to make a success. \"Do as I did,go into something today that is scorned, scoffed and ridiculed,when you are my age it will be the success of the world, then youwill be a top-ringer,\" was his reply. Go into the wilderness, start atown, in twenty years you will be its mayor and largest propertyholder. 46ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Freedom, faith and fun are the great tonics of life-freedom to act and think, faith in your own powers and faculties and in thegreat laws of the universe, and with all a wide open door for funand frolic. Don't go glooming through life, afraid of your shadow,but stand straight, hold your jaw up and break into a broad smile ora regular donkey guffaw once or twice in a while.- Soundview. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 In arthritis the joints are overheated, the synovial fluid thickened, osseous material deposited under the articular cartilageon the surface of the bone. These conditions cause the gratingfeeling and sound so often heard and felt in articular rheumatism.The cause of this annoyance is found by Chiropractors andadjusted. The urate of sodium is removed and the joint is madesmooth and slippery. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Innate Intelligence can be compared to the controlling power of a ship. The engineer is the brain who puts into action that power.The assistant engineers, oilers, repair men and firemen representthe various functional lobes. The machinery exhibits the bodilyorgans under control of Innate. The captain on the bridgeillustrates the educated mind, directing the course and outsideaffairs of the ship. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 As protoplasm is a product of the intellectual chemical elements of the \"slime of the sea,\" as animalculae evolve in andfrom stagnant water, vermin from the cheese or cadaver' withoutthe aid of artificer or designer, so cosmic bodies evolve in thecourse of time from the matter composing and surrounding them.The extraneous intellectual agency is needed and the God creationhypothesis is rational. Evolution explains the rest. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Every true Chiropractor that uses specific, pure and unadulterated Chiropractic should hold in his mind that success isas much his right as the acorn has to become an oak or the rosebuda rose. He was taught to succeed. Successful methods are given tohim in his lessons. He has but to place himself in right relationswith these teachings and pay the price of effort. Begin to deviatefrom true principles and you will lose. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"No man is fit to win,\" says Bulwer, \"who has not sat down alone to think and who has not come forth with purpose in his eye,with cheeks white, with lips set, with palms clinched, able to say 'Iam resolved what to do.'\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Furthermore, trials instead of begetting in us, even for a moment, a mood of depression ought to be received with gratitude,inasmuch as they furnish us the means of character development,without which we ever remain mere playthings of events. 47THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Nature lifts millions of tons of water daily and carries it out over the land and distributes it. It shoots enormous thunderboltsthrough space and easily whirls the great planets around throughan area unknown and uncomprehensible to the human mind. Sheupsets cities in one hour, buries others with the debris of volcanoesin a day, creates new islands where before there were none\u2014yet Iread in the advertisements that Dudnflicker's Little Liver Pills are necessary \"to assist Nature.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 It is no easy matter, indeed, when one has reached maturity, especially if there are others dependent on him, to change hisoccupation or profession. One must think many times beforegiving up a certainty for an uncertainty, a salary or sure income foran expectation. It calls for moral courage and strength of will andpurpose to brave criticism and ridicule and the risk of failure, butfor the one who is sure he has discovered his real bent\u2014if hewould do his best in life\u2014there is no choice but to make achange.\u2014 Success. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"Mind is the intellectual, the rational faculty in man or beast; the understanding; the intellect; the power that conceives, judges,or reasons.\" To use this mental capacity, whether inborn orcultivated, is to think. This process forms the mind. Mind is the product of thinking. Thought is not produced by the mind, it is the result of brain action. To produce it by using thebrain, is to employ one of the functions. Behind all is Innate, who uses the brain to produce thought. Innate does the thinking, using its mind or intellect. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Stick to your own gifts; insist upon your own talent; be absolutely loyal to yourself; don't let others tempt or persuade youto abandon the calling your soul tells you is yours. Be true to yourown convictions if you hope to develop the progress in life. Thethought, dreams and inspirations that come to you are yours\u2014theybelong to you by the law that governs your particular existence.The dreams and aspirations someone else has for you do notbelong to, you if they conflict with what your intuition tells you isyour calling. Don't try to adjust your eyes to another; you can't doit. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The hands contains twenty-seven bones, the foot twenty-six. The extra one in the hand being the pisiform; so named becausesome one thought it resembled a pea in shape. In the adult it is about an inch by five-sixteenths in diameter, spheroidal in form and articulates with the cuniform. Its outersurface is anterior and rough for the attachment of muscles. 48ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Its whole size projects anterior of the other seven bones of the carpus, or wrist, and is situated on the ulnar side, on the outer andfront. The position and eminence of the pisiform makes it suitable for the Chiropractor to use while giving vertebral adjustments. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic Calorific Nerves. Calorific nerves convey impulses from Innate brain to tissue cell. Its impulses is the sparkwhich ignites combustion of materials previously placed at eachcell. It can be aptly compared to the motor and gasoline.

Osteopathy cures which makes pure, rich blood andstrong nerves.\"\u2014 Journal of Osteopathy. Bad digestion causing other diseases is Osteopathic. One disease producing another is Allopathic. In etiology theOsteopaths and medical schools agree. Chiropractors find that the above ailments are effects, not caused by each other, but from nerve impingement. It is the business of the Osteopath to make \"pure, rich blood and strong nerves.\" The Chiropractor is concerned in finding thecause of disturbed functions, removing pressure from nerves toallow them to perform their several acts undisturbed. In pathology the Osteopaths agree with the medical schools. The Chiropractors do not coincide with any of them. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Henry S. Bunting, A. B., D. O., says in Medical Talk: \"None but the Osteopaths teach the art and science of examining theback.\" According to A. T. Still, the founder of Osteopathy, not more than one per cent of their examinations are done on the back. TheChiropractors make a special examination of the spine for 95 percent of diseases. The osteopaths are especially interested in bloodand lesions as causes of disease. The Chiropractors are spinespecialists. \"To those who have defective throats, a soreness, an itching, hoarseness, ulcerated tonsils, or quinsy, osteopathy appears as asure and safe remedy; it is the treatment par-excellence for all circulatory disturbances.\"\u2014 Journal of Osteopathy. Osteopathic literature states that diseases of the throat are due to disturbances of the circulating fluids. Chiropractors find thatthe portion affected is inflamed, over-heated, caused by nervesbeing impinged on the right side of the spinal column. Wherein is there any likeness or resemblance between the two sciences? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 There are one, two and three-story men.

They think predigested thoughts, have capsule ideasand tabloid opinions. 50ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS The second-grade are those so-called teachers, exploiters, grafters.

Frank Lintaber, in Puck. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 THE PALMER FAMILY. The first to receive the name Palmer was Sir Ralph le Palmer. Having distinguished himself in single combat against theSaracens in the Holy Land, he received knighthood on thebattlefield by the surname. Henceforth he bore the palm branch. It was indeed, as a palmer that he had gone to Palestine. There was a distinction betweenpalmer and pilgrim. The palmer was a devotee. He spent all histime in the Crusade or visiting holy shrines. A pilgrim returned tohis usual life as soon as his particular expiatory journey wasfinished. The pilgrim laid aside his palm and cockleshell; thepalmer never discarded them. He also wore a black mantle, withSt. Peter's keys wrought in red upon the shoulder. The origin of the name must, therefore, always be consecreated with memories of high and holy purpose. The word \"palmer\" soonpassed into literature. \"My scepter for a palmer's walking Shakespeare. 52ITS PRINCIPLES \"Where Do Palmers Lodge, I You?\" \"Where do the Palmers lodge, I beseech you?\" was considered an appropriate line to use upon the invitations sent to some fourthousand Palmers for the first meeting of the family association.This was in 1879, 250 years after Walter Palmer, the pilgrim, cameto the New World, and the meeting place was the site of Walter'shome in Stonington, Connecticut. Processions, orations, poems,songs, toasts and feasting made up the program for the day. It wasnot a solemn occasion, one for weeping at the tomb of dead andgone ancestors, but quite the contrary. The late Courtlandt Palmer,of New York, started the fun by referring to the tradition that \"Ourcommon ancestor, Walter, was nine feet tall and lived to be 150.He came over with Pilgrims in Her Majesty's ship, Mayflower,and landed on the top of Plymouth Rock. Whether fact or fiction,it was related of Walter that he, like others of his day gave theIndians trash, gew gaws and beads for lands in place of cash. 53THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Walter's wife was Rebecca Short. She first appears upon the pages of the family history clad in a simple, homespun gown, withshining braids of hair, flashing her beauty \"till words and smiles and blushes inter-blending, had then,as now, the same delicious ending\"\u2014a wedding. This is simply aquotation taken from the family history. Ulysses S. Grant, a Palmer. Ulysses S. Grant was a lineal descendant of Walter Palmer. Palmer blood flowed in the veins of four governors, cabinetmembers, jurists, doctors and ministers who have been famous intheir time. Walter was not the first of the name in the New World. The pioneer was Wm. Palmer, who came over in the Fortune in 1621,the next ship after the Mayflower. The Palmer Patriots. Joseph Palmer trampled the Stamp Act under his feet (figuratively speaking, of course,) and spurned old England's taxin tea. He was a member of the Provincial Congress of 1774. Hestarted out in the war as colonel and ended as brigadier general.Deacon Stephen Palmer signed the association test, as it wascalled, binding himself, at the risk of his life and fortune, to opposethe hostile measures of the British. The family has its tale of romance. Ichabod, the fourth of Walter, and the tallest, strongest man in town, dashed through thewaves of Narragansett Bay on his trusty horse and carried BettyNoyes away despite parental wrath and strategy. The Palmers of note are legion, but in a brief sketch it is only possible to mention three or four. Samuel Palmer was one of thefew really great English etchers. John Palmer was the originator ofthe guarder coach for carrying the mail; before this Great Britainsuffered continual losses from highway robberies of mail coaches.One of the greatest bridge builders in the United States wasTimothy Palmer, who lived about the middle of the eighteenthcentury. Representatives of the family in England are Sir Roundell Palmer and Dr. Edward Palmer, professor of Arabic at Cambridge,and one of the first Oriental scholars in the world. Representatives in America. Representatives in America are Daniel David Palmer, discoverer, and son, B. J. Palmer, developer of that philosophy,Chiropractic. The latter is one of the few great thinkers who hadthe determination to advance a line of thought, continue to developit, independent enough to make it recognized as a science. Mrs.Potter Palmer, of Chicago, is a typical social leader of the NewWorld. One of the first in wealth in Chicago. The Palmer Housewas so named after that branch of the family. 54ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Coat of Arms. Forty-five coats of arms have been granted to the Palmer family at different times.

Chiropractic was discovered in 1895 by D. D. Palmer, although B. J. Palmer has, since, developed this science until nowChiropractors are justly proud of it. Chiropractors find that alldiseases are caused by subluxations of the vertebral column, whichimpinge the nerves. When they are free to act naturally in theirentire course, there is health. Chiropractors definitely locate thedisplacements that are the cause of disordered conditions. Whenthese subluxated points are replaced and the pinched nerves freed,there is no longer abnormal function. The medical world has long recognized subluxations of the spinal column accompanied with fracture, but has always insistedthat it was almost impossible to displace a vertebra withoutfracture. The M. D.'s wrenches and sprains of the back areChiropractic subluxations. Many a mother and her child have been injured at delivery by displacements of some of the fifty-two articular joints of the spine.It is the Chiropractor's business to replace these, thereby freeingthe impinged nerves so that they may perform their normalfunction. The fundamental principles of Chiropractic are founded on anatomy, pathology, physiology and nerve tracing. Physicians who give us fifteen minutes' attention while explaining Chiropractic subluxations by the use of specimens athand, admit that there may be many diseases arising from thedisplacements of the vertebral column. But our being able toreplace them by hand is very much doubted until demonstrated;one practical exhibition removes all doubt. The spinal column is the central axis of the skeletal frame. It supports the head and ribs, and through them the weight of theupper extremities. The weight is transmitted downward to the ossainnominata through the bodies and the articular processes of thevertebrae. It is an elastic structure composed of bony segments,between which are interposed elastic fibrous cartilages calleddiscs. Flexion, extension, and rotation have a normal limit; to a certain extent they are permitted in all parts of the spinal column.These various movements are due to elastic cushions. Wrenches 55THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC in many different ways separate the intervertebral and articular cartilages and displace the vertebrae, causing a narrowing of theforamina through which nerves pass out from the spinal cord,deranging the functions of these nerves by pressure. When we study the anatomy of the spinal column, we no longer wonder at the many subluxations, and are surprised that we do notfind more of them. Could we but fancy the main shaft of amachine capable of the various movements and wrenches that thevertebral column is subjected to, we would no longer be astonishedwhen Chiropractors find and show us the vertebrae that are slippedmore or less out of place. Is not the human machine much moreliable to have its different parts rocked out of their proper positionand the resultant consequences more severe than that of theinanimate machine? The inevitable conclusion is, that the laws of natural philosophy apply to the backbone of the human body much more so than theydo to the central shaft of inanimate machines. Such being the case,why not use the same good judgment in adjusting thedisplacements of the central line shaft of the human body whichsustains and gives firmness to the skeletal frame? Why search theworld over for an antidote? Why not look for the cause of ourtroubles within and correct them? The above questions are answered by Chiropractors, who locate and verify with definite precision the subluxations which causeabnormal functions. This is done by anatomical knowledge of thevertebral column, the finding of sensitive, swollen, inflamednerves, which are traced by digital examination, and sensationfrom the exit of the spinal foramen to the part affected. By handadjustment we correct the wrongs which cause disease. Wereplace the vertebrae in proper position, restoring the bonyopenings, named foramina, to their normal size and shape. Thesemovements are done by the hands, using the transverse andspinous processes as handles for adjusting. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 THE HISTORY OF CHIROPRACTIC. Chiropractic was discovered by Dr. D. D. Palmer, and developed into a science by B. J. Palmer, his son. What is there more for me to say? All that I can possibly do is to relate the unwritten history. How, after the discovery by D. D. Palmer, who had been practicing \"Magnetic Healing,\" it was looked upon by thepublic as a fake, a subterfuge, a talking point, if you please,whereby the Doctor, by claiming to discover something new, could help his business financially. They knew not what it consisted of.His patients did not know what he did. How the few personalfriends of the Doctor, here in the city, undertook to prove to thepublic that the discovery of Chiropractic was a wonder and thatunder Chiropractic adjustments miracles were performed; howthey were met with scoffs and sneers; 56ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS how they were ostracized from the society of their friends, and were called cranks and fools for being the tools used by Dr. Palmerto further his own personal prosperity. They were not bound bythe chains of the monopoly. They were free and independent.They owed no doctor bills and cared little or naught for theirsneering and abuse. They wavered not one whit from their course,not to benefit Dr. Palmer, nor for hope of reward, nor fear ofpunishment; they did and are doing it still for the benefit of suffering humanity. They were handicapped at the start from the fact that \"Dr. D. D.\" did not explain or demonstrate anything pertaining toChiropractic. He deemed it advisable to keep the secret to himself,lest someone would rob him of his glory. It seems strange to us now that he did at that time take such a stand; but you must recollect that Chiropractic, as discovered and developed, on thatday was as compared to the Science of Chiropractic of today as the stage coach is compared with the Pullman palace car. He thoughtit possible and more than probable that almost anyone, particularlya medical practitioner, could give an adjustment as well as he, didthey see the act once performed. So time wore on with seasons ofsuccessful adjustments\u2014at that time two or three unsuccessfulcases would have upset the reputation gained by two or threemonths of success. Dr. D. D. Palmer could not successfullydetermine this essential point; i. e., at what stage of diseased condition a pinched nerve would fail to revive and perform itsnatural and normal function. Let me illustrate: we find a manbeing choked by another. One will give the victim a shower bathof warm water; another applies a mustard plaster; the third gives ahypodermic injection, but still the man chokes. The Chiropracticgrabs the assailant by the nape of the neck and seat of the pantsand throws him in the creek. Very well, the cause is removed, butwill he recover; has he been strangled so long that he cannot beresuscitated? A nerve can be under pressure so long or severe thatadjustments will not restore the nerve to its normal condition. Dr.D. D. Palmer did not know this and so he made some failures. Now the condition is determined upon examination, and such patients are told that they cannot receive their normal condition,and the Chiropractor is thought to be a person who knows something. It has always been strange to me why all of these new discoveries were made at exactly the proper time, when theconditions demanded them. There must be back and behind all anunseen power, which you may call Innate Intelligence, thatpromotes all actions. When the old world became so denselypopulated that it became crowded, this power promptedChristopher Columbus to seek a new world across the then trackless sea for the overflow of the human family. This same agent was manifest when it became necessary to flash intelligence across the continents, and Franklin and Morsewere given this mission to perform. When it became necessary 57THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC for rapid transportation of food products, young Watt was stopped at his mother's kitchen stove and tried to hold the cover on hismother's tea kettle; thus was the power of steam discovered. Soafter years of various methods of relieving pain and distress bysacrifices, burning oils and chemicals, prayers and incantations,herb teas, drawing the life's blood, administering vegetable andmineral poisons into the stomach, the human faculty becomingweaker and weaker, superstition and prejudice practicallyobliterated, the season was ripe and to Dr. D. D. Palmer was giventhe mission of discovering the cause of diseased conditions and to start a crusade in the interest of humanity; but like Columbus,Franklin and Watt, he seemed satisfied with the glory of thediscovery, and, as is always the case with new discoveries andinventions, someone else had to develop. So in this case, when \"Dr. D. D.\" laid down the burden, because it had gotten too heavyfor him to carry, a stripling of a boy took up the load and said tothese friends of his father, \"Now, boys, if you will give me the aidyou tried to give 'D. D.,' we will demonstrate to the world thatChiropractic is a science, and make it so plain that any man, though a fool, cannot err therein. I will tell you all the basicprinciples of Chiropractic, so you can discuss the subject with anyyou may come in contact with, even a medical doctor,successfully.\" How well he has succeeded, you all know. He haskept steadily on, night and day, until now, behold Chiropractic inthe fullness of its glory. No longer looked upon by the public as afake, but it stalks boldly forth over land, from ocean to ocean, yea,into far distant lands, across the seas, strewing wreaths of flowers,a wealth of sunshine, along its path, a hope to the afflicted, newlife to the paralytic and a glamour of light in the darkened chamberof death; the sun in its mission of furnishing heat and light to theearth ever shines upon some Chiropractor. The public now fear itas some unconquerable giant. Why? Only lest it deprive some ofthemselves or friends of the pecuniary benefit derived fromadministering or dispensing drugs and poisons. They wouldsacrifice the life of themselves, family or friends rather than gain the enmity of the drug dispenser or the medical doctor. Strange asit may seem to you, I have known instances where they have, underthe aid of a law, lobbied through the legislatures by a certainschool of practitioners, protected themselves in using a prescribedmethod for relieving pain, which they think cannot, and which, ifthey can present, will not be improved. You may live or die, butyou must follow the path they have marked out. Why is this lawallowed to stand on our statute books by a Christianized and God-fearing people? Ts it for the purpose of alleviating pain andsuffering? Oh, no! It is for the purpose of defending andprotecting those who are engaged in the business of administeringand dispensing poison and are clothed with the lawful power ofusing the instruments of torture, lancet, knife, and are willing tosacrifice anything and everything, no matter how cruel\u2014theirbusiness must be pro- 58ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS tected at all hazards. How long will the people tolerate these indignities? Only so long as they can be blinded. How can thisyoke be thrown off? Only by demonstrating Chiropractic. I hopeto live to see the day when anyone sticking a knife into a humanbeing he or she shall be amenable to the criminal law, whether heor she has a diploma from a medical college or not; when everyonewho administers poison to another shall suffer the same penaltywhether it is done behind a 6 x 8 diploma from a medical school ordid such with murderous intent by a jealous or insane crank, or fora fee regulated by law or done for the mere desire of revenge. HOWARD NUTTING, Davenport, Iowa. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 THE FIRST CHIROPRACTIC PATIENT. This is an excellent likeness of Harvey Lillard, the first person who received a Chiropractic adjustment. Magnetic healing was, for nine years, the forerunner of Chiropractic, although not used as others, who slapped and rubbed.The aim was to locate in the patient the cause of each disease. To illustrate, it was decided that all diseases of the throat, such as goitre, croup, diphtheria, bronchitis, quincy and tonsillitis, hadtheir origin in the region of the stomach. Under the science ofChiropractic it was ascertained that the nerves of intervention ofthe stomach emerge from the left side of the spinal column andthose which produce the above diseases by deranged functionsproceed from the right side. The nerves of the stomach only maybe impinged, but usually when there is a subluxation of thevertebra, so as to impinge nerves on one side, they also impingethose on the opposite. On Sept. 18, 1895, Harvey Lillard called upon Dr. Palmer. He was asked how long he had been deaf. He answered, \"seventeenyears.\" He could not hear the rumbling of a wagon upon the street.Mr. Lillard informed the doctor that at the time he became deaf hewas in a cramped position and felt something give in his back.Upon examination there was found a displaced vertebra, one thatwas not in line. Dr. Palmer informed Mr. Lillard that he thoughthe could be cured of deafness by fixing his spine. He consented. Two adjustments were given, which replaced a vertebra, freeing nerves that had been paralyzed by pressure. This explains why somany persons \"have been deaf ever since they had the measles,\"which was the acute stage, the deafness being the chronic. Since relieving Mr. Lillard of deafness, we have learned that this affection may be caused by subluxations of the othervertebrae. In some persons it is a prenatal cause, which cannot beimproved by adjustment. 59THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC HARVEY LILLARD. 60ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Chiropractors, by one or two adjustments, replace displaced vertebrae which cause acute diseases. Without an acute stage,there cannot be a chronic. If the displacement which causesexcessive heat and rash was replaced before the crisis, there wouldbe no such complications as diphtheria, croup, lung affections anddeafness. Mr. Lillard can hear as well today as other men. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 CHIROPRACTIC FOUNDED ON PRINCIPLE. We look upon the giant locomotive as a thing of strength and beauty, and charmed with the Herculean power of locomotion itcan be hurled over the rails at the rate of 100 miles per hour,carrying its freightage of human life. Yet, after all, the secret of itsmomentous force lies in a simple principle; the steam, alternatelyforcing the piston rod backward and forward, causes the revolutionof the ponderous drive wheels to which it is connected.Chiropractic, like the locomotive, demonstrates principle\u2014uniqueadjustment. Giant strides have been achieved by inventive genius, but little has been done in adjusting displaced vertebrae until within the lastfew years. Chiropractic is rational, because automatically correct, the removal of pressure opens the intervertebral foramina, thus thenerves respond to normal function and the patient is freed fromdisease. It is practical, because it strikes directly at the root of the trouble and, therefore, removes the physical representative of thecause. Chiropractic Adjustment Quickly Given. A Chiropractic adjustment is quickly given, thus enabling one to adjust hundreds of patients daily, multiplying his usefulness forthe relief of suffering humanity. The illustration so often repeated impresses one with the truth and virtue of Chiropractic. Let us for a moment fancy a dwellingwith an opening in the roof where the water trickles from everyrain, destroying its furnishings. The owner applies varnish andsecures new furniture and carpets, only to find that each stormcauses the same sad havoc. Why does he not secure the services ofa carpenter to fix the leak in the roof ? Again, let us imagine the man whose wife is suffering from typhoid fever. He secures the services of a competentChiropractor, one who removes the pressure on nerves whichcause this disease. After a few adjustments she is well. Think ofthe common sense in remedies which only relieve for a time andare powerless in adjusting subluxated vertebrae, which is not onlythe cause of typhoid fever, but the category of disease. 61THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Chiropractic Rays of Light. It is interesting and instructive to notice the various opinions of medical writers in regard to subluxations of the vertebral column,and how near they were to that which is now known as Chiropractic. Below are given extracts from standard anatomistsand orthopedical books. A Chiropractic subluxation is the partial displacement of articular surfaces of the fifty-two spinal joints, and is not usuallyaccompanied with fracture. The replacing of these subluxatedvertebrae are readily accomplished by a Chiropractor. When werefer to Chiropractic subluxations of the spinal column, we speakof those which have been only partially displaced in the articularprocesses. Medical writers usually refer to complete luxations of the vertebrae\u2014they know of no other. Such rarely occur withoutfracture and instant death is the usual result. In this we fully agree. Samuel Cooper. Samuel Cooper says, \"Every kind of joint is not equally liable to dislocation. Experience proves, indeed, that in the greater partof the vertebral column, luxations are absolutely impossible , the pieces of bone being articulated by extensive, numerous surfaces,varying in their form and direction, and so tied together by manypowerful, elastic means, that very little motion is allowed.Experience proves, also, that the Strength of the articulations ofthe pelvic bones can scarcely be affected by enormous efforts,unless these bones be simultaneously fractured. \"The large surfaces, with which these bones support each other, the number and thickness of their ligaments, the strength of theirmuscles, the little degree of motion which each vertebra naturallyhas, and the vertical direction of the articular processes, makedislocation of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae impossible unlessthere also be a fracture of the above mentioned process of thesecases I shall merely remark, that they can only result from immense violence, that the symptoms would be an irregularity in the disposition of the spinous processes, retention or continuanceof the urine or feces, paralysis, or other injury, to which the spinalmarrow when the spinal marrow has merely undergone a violentconcussion, without any fracture or dislocation whatever; and it iscertain that most of the cases mentioned by authors as dislocationsof the lumbar and dorsal vertebrae have only been concussions ofthe spinal marrow, or fracture of such bones. \"The os occipitis and first cervical vertebra are so firmly connected by ligaments that there is no instance of their being luxated from an external cause, and were the accident to happen, it would immediately prove fatal by the unavoidable compression and injury of the spinal marrow.\" 62ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Delpech. Delpech asserts, without qualification, that a careful examination of the form and situation of the bones of the spinemust convince the observer that such accidents as displacedvertebrae cannot occur. J. L. Petit. J. L. Petit tells of a child being instantly killed by being lifted by the head. C. Bell. C. Bell, after relating a case, remarks: \"Patients can hardly be expected to survive a mischief of this kind, when the transverseligament is broken, and the process dentatus is thrown directlybackward against the medulla oblongata, the effect must be instant death.\" Dupuytren. Dupuytren cautions the future Chiropractor in regard to spinal dislocations in the following language: \"The reduction of these dislocations is very dangerous, and we have often known an individual to perish from the compression or elongation of thespinal cord, which always attends these attempts.\" Howe. Howe expresses the same warning when he says, \"Death has occurred from attempts to effect reduction in cases of vertebralluxations.\" A. Cooper. A. Cooper says, \"In the spine, the motion between any two bones is so small that dislocation hardly ever occurs, except between the first and second vertebrae, although the bones areoften displaced by fracture.\" Kirkland observes, \"There are some luxations which are far worse injuries than fractures; of this description, the dislocationsof the vertebrae, cases which, indeed, can hardly happen without fracture, and are almost always fatal.\" Stimpson. Stimpson refers to \"The possibility of the occurrence of pure dislocation of the lumbar vertebrae, which has long been in doubt because of the close interlocking of the processes and the strengthof the ligaments, is proved by two cases collected by Blasius, and also by two others, in which there was present associated, butunimportant, fracture of some of the processes.\" The same author, speaking of dislocation of the atlas, from the axis, says, \"Dislocation forward or backward is possible only afterfracture of the odontoid process, or rupture of the trans- 63THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC verse ligament, or by the slipping of the process beneath the ligament.\" McClellan. McClellan, in his Regional Anatomy, Vol. 2, gives his opinion of vertebral dislocations in the following language: \"Dislocation of the spinal columns is especially grave. A simple dislocation ofany of the vertebrae can happen only in the cervical region, as the construction of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae is such that adislocation necessarily involves a fracture of some part of thebone.\" Gerrish. Gerrish sums up the question by saying, \"Simple dislocation between two vertebrae is, therefore, almost possible , unless perhaps in the cervical region, where the surfaces of the articularprocesses are more nearly horizontal.\" Lawrence. Mr. Lawrence says, \"The possibility of the occurrence of complete dislocations of the vertebrae without fracture has longbeen a disputed point among many of the first surgical writers.\" Gray. Gray asserts, under the head of surgical anatomy, \"The ligaments which unite the component parts of the vertebraetogether are so strong, and these bones are so interlocked by thearrangement of their articulating processes, that dislocation is very uncommon , and indeed, unless accompanied by fracture, rarely occurs, except in the upper part of the neck. Dislocation of the occiput from the atlas has only been recorded in one or two cases; but dislocation of the atlas from the axis, with rupture of thetransverse ligament, is much more common; it is the mode inwhich death is produced in many cases of execution by hanging.In the lower part of the neck\u2014that is, below the third cervicalvertebra\u2014dislocation unattended by fracture occasionally takesplace.\" Erichsen. Erichsen says, in his first edition, \"On looking at the arrangement of the articular surfaces of the vertebrae, the verylimited motion of which they are susceptible, and the way in whichthey are closely knit together by strong ligaments and short,powerful muscles, it is obvious that dislocation of these bones must be exceedingly rare. So seldom, indeed, do they occur, that their existence has been denied by many surgeons. Yet there are asufficient number of instances on record to prove incontestablythat these accidents may happen . Those cases that have been met with have usually been associated with partial fracture, but this complication is not necessary. In all, the dis- 64ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS placement was incomplete, and indeed, a complete dislocation cannot occur. \"Dislocation of the atlas from the occipital bone has been described in two instances only. \"Dislocation of the axis from the atlas is of more frequent occurrence. It may happen with or without a fracture of the odontoid process. \"In the dorsal region, dislocation of the spine, though excessively rare, may occur. The last dorsal vertebra has beenseveral times found dislocated from the first lumbar. \"Dislocation of any one of the five cervical vertebrae may occur. The third vertebra is that which is less frequently dislocated; the fifth that which is more commonly displaced.Treatment of these injuries is sufficiently simple. No attempt at reduction can, of course, be made.\" My experience of ten years as a Chiropractor differs materially from that of Dr. Erichsen. I have found the third vertebra to be themost frequently displaced of any cervical. The atlas and fourthwill come second in frequency. The seventh is rarely dislocated,owing to its being braced by the clavicle and the first pair of ribs.If Dr. Erichsen could see the ability displayed by a Chiropractor inreplacing displaced cervical vertebrae, hear them return to theirproper position with an audible crack, he would no longer say, \"Noattempt at reduction can, of course, be made.\" Walton. Walton asserts, in a late New York Medical Journal, that \"Cervical dislocation occurs more frequently than is generallysupposed, and that the results of the injury are nearly alwayssusceptible of speedy, safe and complete amelioration. \"Three methods of treatment have been proposed: (1) Reduction by traction, with or without abduction, and rotation. (2)Reduction by abduction and rotation, but without traction. (3)Reduction by dorso lateral flexion combined, if necessary, withslight rotation. The last method, in the author's opinion, is thebest. The employment of traction is a futile measure. Notinfrequently reduction takes place spontaneously, during sleep, atother times it occurs accidentally during the relaxation producedby an anesthetic. In seven cases observed by the author reductiontook place as follows: Two reductions occurred in sleep, threeduring etherization, and two were effected by operation.\" Cervical dislocation\u2014partial displacement\u2014is much, more common than is supposed by medical men. The replacing ofwhich is safely and quickly done by the hands of a Chiropractor. Instead of using a machine to stretch the spine, moving the vertebrae from or around its axis, we adjust by hand, using thespinous processes as levers. 65THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Howe. Howe gives an interesting case which we think worth quoting: \"In 1856 I was summoned to an Irishman, who had fallen from achamber window to the ground, head foremost. I found the patientwith his head twisted to one side and rigidly held in that position.He uttered cries of distress and called lustily for relief, 'a stitch inmy neck, doctor, a stitch in my neck.' I took hold of his ears andendeavored to pull and twist his head into its natural position, butwas unable to accomplish my object. By pressing my fingers intothe soft structures of the neck, I could feel a bony displacement toexist between the third and fourth vertebrae, though I was unableto discover the exact nature or extent of the displacement. Perhapsanother vertebra was implicated in the displacement. By help ofassistants, who laid hold of the patient's head and feet, we madepowerful extension and counter-extension, together with sometwisting motion, reduction, which was attended with an audiblesnap, was accomplished. The patient then moved his head andneck with case and complained no more of sharp pain. He sufferedfrom great soreness in the neck for a week or more, yet recoveredwithout physical defect or lasting functional impairment. I am quite sure no process of bone was broken; and that the injury wasa simple luxation, occurring between two or more of the cervical vertebrae.\" Erichsen. Dr. Erichsen declares, \"Dislocation of the articular processes of the cervical vertebrae occasionally occurs. In these cases the patient, after a sudden movement, or a fall on the head, feels muchpain and stiffness in the neck, the head being fixed immovably,and turned to the opposite, side to that on which the displacement has occurred. In these cases I have known reduction effected by the surgeon placing his knees against the patient's shoulders,drawing on the head, and then turning it into position, the return being effected with a distinct snap.\" If the victim of the following mishap should read the above two cases, he would feel like directing the Old School to the newmethod. The following is copied from The Davenport Republican of Jan. 1, 1905: \"Frank Runge, who lives at 611 West Sixteenth street, has enjoyed the unique distinction of having his neck dislocated andfixed. One morning he did not arise from his slumbers as soon ashis sister and aunt thought he ought to. So they went to his room,and each taking hold of a foot, tried to pull him out of bed. Heplayfully resisted and in the melee that followed, he managed todisplace five bones in his neck. The bones being the atlas, axis,third, fourth and fifth cervicals. The accident was a painful one.Runge's head was so turned that his face looked over his shoulder. 66ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS \"The young man was carried from his home to a bu ggy and driven to the office of Dr. Palmer, who realized the trouble at once.After three adjustments he had the neck in as good working orderas ever. The cure was as remarkable as the accident was peculiar.Runge feels all right, but has no desire to go through the ordealagain. Next time his sister and aunt try to pull him out of bed, theycan pull all they want to, he will not resist.\" The above reduction was made with the hands, using the spinous processes as handles.. The New York Journal of Medicine. The New York Journal of Medicine for 1852 contains an account of dislocation of the dorsal vertebrae: \"The injury wasproduced by the fall of a door, the man being under it in a stoopingposture. The lower extremities were immediately paralyzed. Atthe seat of the injury, which was at the junction of the lumbar and dorsal vertebrae, there was a marked appearance of displacement of the parts, which seemed to arise from a fracture and dislocation, on the sliding of the body of one vertebra over another. Thesurgeon placed the patient on his front, and fastened a folded sheetunder his arms and another above his hips; chloroform having beenadministered, extending and counter-extending forces were appliedby means of the sheets, and the various vertebrae were reduced. Insix or eight weeks the patient recovered the use of his limbs andnormal evacuations took place. Ultimately, the recovery wascomplete, though a prominence remained at the seat of injury.\" There are two features in the above case to which I desire to draw special attention. The marked displacement that was visiblein the vertebral spines, which the surgeons did not replace, asshown by the last line. Also, in using the folded sheets, in thesame manner so freely paraded and described by Dr. O. G. Smithas the Frank Dvorsky method, is not new, nor confined toBohemians. It is here classed as orthopedic surgery. Pott. Pott states a case where no violence had been committed or received, his first intimation was a sense of weakness in his backbone, accompanied with what he described as a dull kind ofpain, attended with such a lassitude as rendered a small degree ofexercise fatiguing; this was followed by an unusual sense ofcoldness in the thighs, not accountable by a change of weather, anda palpable diminution of their sensibility. After a short time hislimbs were frequently convulsed by involuntary twitchings,particularly troublesome in the night; and soon after this, he notonly became incapable of walking, but his power, either ofretaining or discharging his urine and feces was considerablyimpaired. 67THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC He continues to say, \"In the adult I will not assert that external mischief is always and totally out of the question, but I will venture to affirm what is equal, as far as regards the true nature of the case,which is, that although accidents and violence may in some fewinstances be allowed to have contributed to its more immediateappearance, yet the part in which it shows itself must have beenpreviously in a morbid state, and thereby predisposed for theproduction of it. I do not by this mean to say that a violent exertion cannot injure the spine, or produce a paralytic complaint; that would be to say more than I know; but I will venture to assertthat no degree of violence whatever is capable of producing suchan appearance as I am now speaking of, unless the bodies of thevertebrae were by previous distemper disposed to give way; andthat there was no supposable dislocation, by mere violence, doneto the bones of the back, which bones were, before the receipt ofthe injury, in a sound state.\" Dr. Ayers. Dr. Ayers reports in the New York Journal of Medicine a case of dislocation occurring between the cervical vertebrae from some unknown cause, as the man was intoxicated at the time he receivedthe injury. The neck was rigid and exhibited a peculiar deformitywhich could not attend any lesion except luxation of one or moreof the cervical vertebrae. There was no paralysis; but intense painattended the displacement. Great difficulty was experienced inattempts to drink or swallow food. The esophagus and larynxseemed to be pressed upon by the bulging forward of several of thecervical vertebrae. The back of the neck was rendered excessivelyconcave and the integument it was thrown into folds as it is whenthe head is forced back against the shoulders, the front of the neckpresented a correspondent convexity. Between the spinous processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae a markeddepression could be felt, and this was the point at which the greatest distress was felt by the patient. Dr. Ayers, with severalsurgical assistants, who concurred with him in the diagnosis,performed a successful reduction while the patient was under theinfluence of chloroform. Extension was applied to the head, andcounter extension to the shoulders, and while the head was rotatedand pressure made upon prominent points in the neck, the displaced bones hence returned to their former position and the head and neck resulted their natural attitude and aspect. What a time these surgeons had replacing vertebrae! Chiropractors never give chloroform. Dr. Ayers would hardlyequal the practitioner of Chiropractic who often adjusts at the rateof one a minute. That \"marked depression\" was a coming together of the spinous processes, causing lordosis and the pinching of nerves in theforamina. 68ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Samuel Cooper. Samuel Cooper remarks: \"I believe no modern practitioner now ever advises supporting the spine with machinery, on thesupposition of there being any dislocation; an error which formerly prevailed. \"The cervical vertebrae, however, not having such extensive articular surfaces, and having more motion, are occasionally luxated. The dislocation of the head from the first vertebra, and the first vertebra from the second, particularly the last accident, isthe most common; but luxation of the cervical vertebrae lowerdown, though very rare, are possible.\" Beck. Peck evidently recognized displacements of vertebrae, for he says, \"The most important sight is the traumatic kyphosis,produced by a displacement of the spinous process, whereby aprominence is caused. Sometimes more than one vertebra isconcerned.\" Dunglison's Dictionary allows Chiropractic sunbeams to shine on page 1039, under two heads, \"Spinal irritation, a supposederethistic state of the spinal cord, indicated by tenderness onpressure over the spinal process of one or more vertebrae, or overthe nerves proceeding from the cord and distributed to the parts atthe sides of the spine.\" \"Spinal localization, the designation of aparticular part of the spinal cord as the center of certainphysiological functions or of muscular movements or reflexes.\" Brodie. Mr. Brodie's opinion, deduced from dissection: \"In many instances caries of the spine has its origin in the bodies of thevertebrae themselves, which are liable to the same disease of thecancellus structure, which is noticed in the articulating extremitiesof other bones. In some cases rest in a horizontal posture, belowground, I believe, must soon be the patient's doom.\" Moore. Moore, speaking of torticollis, says, \"Many cases have their origin at birth; the muscles may be torn, bones may be broken or distorted, nerves may be injured.\" Boyer. Boyer says, \"Many examples have happened, in which one of the inferior oblique or articular processes of a cervical vertebra hasbeen dislocated, so as to cause a permanent inclination of the necktowards the side opposite to that of the displacement.\" 69THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Howe. Howe makes mention of a similar case, caused by cervical dislocation, and describes it thus: \"Some years ago I was called toa lady who had her head drawn forward. The contraction had wrenched at least three of the cervical vertebrae from their articulations, and greatly distorted two others.\" We have observed many persons with a stiff neck, drawn to one side, upon arising in the morning, which they attribute to a draft, orlying in a crooked position. These conditions being acute, andtheir cause, slightly subluxated articular processes, usually rightthemselves. Samuel Cooper. Samuel Cooper, with a physician's understanding, remarks: \"Spontaneous displacements of the atlas may depend upon cariesand scrofulous diseases of the articular surfaces, or upon theexostosis of its transverse process, or a similar tumor growing froma neighboring portion of the os occipitis, or petrous portion of thetemporal bone. By these causes the anterior or posterior arch, orone of the sides of the atlas, has been made to intercept a third, thehalf, and even two-thirds of the diameter of the foramen magnum.Notwithstanding the very remarkable construction of the medullaspinalis thus occasioned, life may be carried on, and the nutritivefunctions performed sufficiently well to afford time enough eitherfor the exostoses to attain a large size, or for the ankyloses, bindingtogether the head and most of the cervical vertebrae, to acquiregreat solidity. The atlas is never found free and distinct, when thusdisplaced, but is confounded at least with the os occipitis, andmostly with five or six of the adjacent vertebrae. Anotherinteresting fact is, that, in cases of this description, the jointbetween atlas and occiput is never the only one which is displacedand deformed, unless the disease be very slightly advanced; for thearticulation of the processes dentatus with the atlas, and sometimesthat of the point of the same process with the occiput, areconsiderably affected. Sometimes the processes dentatus and theocciput retain their natural position with respect to each other, andthe atlas alone seems to be displaced between them. Sometimesthe second vertebra is out of its place with respect to the osoccipitus in the same direction as the atlas, but in not so great adegree. Lastly, in some other instances, the two vertebrae aretwisted in opposite directions, as, for instance, one to the left, theother to the right, or vice versa.\" Cooper. Cooper states that displacements of the atlas depend upon caries, scrofulous diseases of its articular surfaces, exostoses, tumors or an ankylosis. The facts are, as proven by Chiropractic,that by the displacement of the atlas, nerves were impinged in theintervertebral grooves, above and below, thereby deranging 70ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS their functions. Remember, that diseased conditions are but effects of maladministration of mental impulses. Instead of some diseasedconditions being the cause of others, the above abnormalities areall accounted for by the acts of the mental impulses performed inan irregular manner. Moore. Moore says of vertebral displacements, or, as he puts it, spinal distortions, \"Many traumatic cases have their origin at the time of birth; bones may be broken or distorted nerves may be injured.\" Tubby. Tubby gives us a ray of light on this subject when he says: \"Osteoarthritis and osteitis-deformans cause a general kyphosis;nor do they give rise to reflected pain, unless it may happen\u2014arare event, I imagine\u2014that the nerves are pressed upon as they issue from the spinal canal.\" He speaks of the \"bonesetters\" as do many physicians of Chiropractors, when he says, \"Such cases drift about until they fallinto the hands of the 'Bonesetter,' who, with one jerk relieves the patient of his or her disability, and arrogates to himself the credit of putting in a dislocated bone.\" This remark may look strangesandwiched between the one above and the following, copied frompage 81 of his Orthopedic Surgery: \"I recently removed the breast of a patient, who, having found a tumor which she was afraid might be a cancer, kept the matter toherself for nine months. During this time the growth steadilyincreased, and in the last two months she had suffered from verysevere pains in the spine at the level of about the fourth dorsal vertebra, and also around the sides of her chest. When the spine was examined, a well marked angular curvature was found.\" That \"well-marked angular curvature\" was a projecting spinous process of a displaced vertebra. \"About the fourth dorsal\" iswhere we find nerves impinged which produce cancer of thebreast. Those nerves can be traced by a Chiropractor from thespine to the affected part and relieved by adjustment. Still. A. T. Still wisely states: \"A wrench of the spinal column has been given with force enough to slip the vertebral articulations andinhibit nerves. We should remember that slipped or twistedvertebrae must be sought out and adjusted.\" Davis. A. P. Davis, D. O., when describing a cervical treatment, says: \"This movement should be done with caution, so as not 71THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC to dislocate the neck.\" He also states, in his work on Osteopathy Illustrated, \"It was long taught that the dislocation of a rib was responsible for all the mischief; or a dislocated hip, or a slipped vertebra, had much to do in producing disease of all kinds; but the intelligent in the ranks of Osteopathy are ready to concede thecause to other sources, and now it is a pretty well settled fact that dislocation does not play such a role in the production of disease as formerly.\" Bell. C. Bell speaks of an evident loosening between the last cervical and the first dorsal vertebrae, of a considerable space betweenthem, of the destruction of the intervertebral substance. Helferich. Helferich remarks: \"In the dorsal and lumbar regions pure dislocation is exceedingly rare. The possibility of true dislocationin the region of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae has been proven on the post mortem table, but must be almost impossible to recognize in the living subject, i. e., it must be difficult to exclude fracture.\" We differ very much with Dr. Helferich, for we find dorsal and lumbar dislocation, without fracture, very common. Such is demonstrated every day, before the clinic; we do not have to wait to determine on the post mortem table. It is not difficult for a Chiropractor to ascertain which vertebra is subluxated. Erichsen. Erichsen, in his latest edition, says: \"Partial dislocation may exist, unsuspected, the case being considered one of simple contusion.\" Sprains, strains, wrenches, and twists of the spine are of very frequent occurrence. They may be followed by every possible kind of mischief to the vertebral column, its bones or ligaments. Sprains or wrenches of the spine will frequently lay the foundation of serious organic disease of the bones and articularstructures, leading to angular curvature, abscess, paraplegia, andpossibly a fatal result. One of the most remarkable circumstances connected with injuries of the spine is the disproportion that exists between the apparent trifling accident that the patient has sustained and the real and serious mischief that has in reality occurred, and whichwill eventually lead to the gravest consequences. \"Although there is often a long interval between the time of the occurrence of the accident and the supervention of the moredistressing symptoms, and the conviction of the serious nature ofthe injury that has been sustained, it will be found, on closeinquiry, that there has never been an interval, however short, ofcomplete restoration to health.\" 72ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Howe. Howe admitted a Chiropractic sunbeam when he said, \"The dreadful and prolonged sufferings which follow dislocations of thevertebrae are among the worst that can be inflicted upon the humanbody. All complex horrors of paralysis are liable to follow theseluxations, such as bed sores, artificial evacuations of the bladderand rectum, utter dependence upon others to have even necessarywants supplied, and the perversions of the secretions to an extentthat renders every phase of life disagreeable and death welcome.\" Erichsen. John E. Erichsen saw the dawn of Chiropractic when he voiced our sentiments, except that he should have used compression in thefollowing, instead of \"concussion\": \"The effects of concussion ofthe spine, whether arising from violence directly or indirectlyapplied, are occasionally slow in manifesting themselves to the fullintensity; so slow, indeed, that the patient may not connect theirsupervention with the injury which he had sustained some lengthof time previously.\" Simpson. Simpson writes unbiased on this subject and gives us a ray of light: \"Concerning the frequency of dislocation of the vertebrae,widely different opinions have been held; some denying even thepossibility of dislocation without fracture, others think themextremely rare, and others, again, claiming that they are quitecommon. \"The nerve trunks at their point of emergence through the intervertebral foramina may be compressed between the articular process of one vertebra and the body or pedicle of the other. \"The possibility of the occurrence of pure dislocation of the lumbar vertebrae, which has long been in doubt, because of the close interlocking of the processes and the strength of theligaments, is proved by two cases collected by Blasious.\" Howe. Howe refers to this subject by saying, \"In the cervical and lumbar regions, where motion is not restrained by the verticalarticular surfaces, dislocation can occur without absolute necessityof a fracture, but in the dorsal region, where the processes overlap,and are closely locked, simple dislocation seems impossible. \"However, there have been reported during the last few years a number of well authenticated dislocations of the vertebrae indifferent regions of the column. The case of Charles Butcher, who slipped on some steps while carrying a heavy load on his head, inthe end, proved that vertebral luxation can occur.\" 73THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Roberts. M. Roberts made a report of a carpenter, who, when attempting to raise a heavy scaffolding pole, at a certain point, being unable tosustain it any longer, received its weight upon his back. Theaccident was immediately followed by complete paralysis belowthe point injured. Dissection showed that the fifth was separatedfrom the sixth dorsal vertebra. There was no fracture of anyprocess. It is fitting to close this article by referring to Bradford and Lovet. On page 45 is a cut showing reduction of displacedvertebrae, by Calot. The patient is lying face downward on a bifid table. There are nine attendants, four of them have each a limb, stretching the spine. Five surgeons are aproned, one of whom, is operating with his bare hands on the back of the boy, while the rest are interested observers. This much I have read from thepicture. The worded explanation is: \"Forcible correction of the deformity with or without anaesthesia is a method revived inrecent times by Chipault, of Paris, although operated first inSeptember, 1893, reducing the deformity, wiring together thespinous processes of the affected vertebrae. He published anaccount of this method on March 9, 1895. On December 22, 1896,Calot published a paper on the method, in which he said that hisfirst operation dated back only a little over a year. The priority offorcible reduction belongs clearly to Chipault. Wiring the spinousprocesses of the vertebrae was, however, first advocated before theAmerican Orthopedic Association at Washington, September 24,1891. The method has been largely advocated and finds a place inmodern orthopedic treatment. It has been shown that it is not aproceeding attended with as great risk to life, either near or remote,as would have been supposed.\" Palmer. The P. S. C. has placed this much-disputed question under the light of the mid-day sun. It has developed a well-defined sciencethat has no resemblance whatever to any therapeutical subject. The subluxated vertebrae are replaced by hand; these unique movements being unlike those used by any other school. The Chiropractor adjusts any one or all of the 300 articular joints of the human body, but more especially the 52 of the spinalcolumn. They use the long bones as fulcrums and levers, toreplace their subluxated joints. When adjusting vertebrae, theprocesses are used. There is a wide difference in the opinions of the above writers on spinal subluxation. Is it not strange, considering the Bohemian Napravit storm, that there is not a Bohemian book, magazine or literary productionwhich refers to Bohemian spinal adjustment? 74ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS The P. S. C. does not, nor ever has claimed that it discovered that vertebrae may be displaced and replaced. To prove this wegive the above quotations. They, however, are the first to draw thescientific attention of the public to the difference between acomplete luxation, known to the medical world as such, and asubluxation, known to the Chiropractor as a partial displacementof the articular processes. They were the first to write lengthy articles setting forth that 95 to 100 per cent of diseases were caused by subluxations ofvertebrae, and today no other person has placed such statements in the hands of the public unless copied from those in the possessionof The P. S. C. This school was the first to assert that any or all vertebrae were liable to be subluxated, before or at birth, in youth and adult age.That vertebrae are often subluxated before birth; and how and whyhas not yet been given by any other periodical. The P. S. C. was the first school to adjust, replace vertebrae by the unique method known as Chiropractic, using the spinous andtransverse processes as handles, placing this method before thepublic by circulars and teachings. It was The P. S. C. which, philosophically, first made the statement that the human body was a machine; and run in all itsparts by a mind, and that all diseases were abnormal functions,made so by deranged mental impulses. \"B. J.\" was the first to discover and affirm that the heating of the body is by mental impulses, and not by blood. He was the first to set forth that club-feet and other prenatal deformities, usually named mother's marks, were caused byintrauterine displacements of the vertebral column, that these maybe corrected by adjusting some one or more of the fifty-two jointsof the backbone. The P. S. C., again, was the first school to discover that insanity is caused by subluxated cervical vertebrae, that by adjusting themthe patients could be restored to normal condition. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 SENSIBLE SUGGESTIONS. If you should let your watch fall, some part of it becoming displaced, or damaged, so that it does not keep good time orrefuses to run, you would take it to a jeweler. Suppose, uponexamination, he should tell you that he must take out one or morecogs, or remove a wheel, to make it keep good time; would youleave it with him? Not for one minute. You would say, \"I havecarried that watch for many years; it has served faithfully, alwayskept correct time, and you cannot make me believe that the factoryput in too many wheels or cogs.\" 75THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Why not use as good judgment in regard to your mother, wife or daughter, whose value is immeasurably greater than that of thewatch? You would not let a jeweler take out any portion of it; butwhen your mother, wife or daughter has had a fall, or met withsome injury, displacing some portion of her anatomy, you at oncecall in the family physician, whom you have learned to love andrespect. He makes a diagnosis and prescribes for her. Day afterday he calls, takes the temperature, respiration, feels the pulse,which does not aid in locating the cause of her trouble. He finallyadvises you to take her to the hospital. There they decide that anoperation must be performed; some parts of her person must beremoved; they have done all else the know, and they must continueto do something. You would not trust your watch in the care of one whom your best reason tells you would ruin it by the removal of sonic of itsworks, but you will trust one whom you love far more than thewatch to the tender mercies of those who rifle them of theirmotherhood. You listen to the sophistry of the wise doctor; he iswilling to take the responsibility, as far as words go, and assures you that the operation will put her on the road to recovery. Youknow that the Creator did not put any useless organs in her anymore than the factory did too many wheels in the watch. Withdread and fear you finally leave her, although you cannot but thinkthat the responsibility, the gain or loss and the payment of the bill,all rests upon you and not upon the physician. You cease to use your reason. You take your watch to the jeweler, who removes two cogs, or a wheel, and returns it to you,saying, \"I hope it will now be all right.\" When you took yourwatch to him it did run, but it did not keep correct time; now, toyour chagrin, you find that it will not go at all. You leave your mother, wife or daughter I in the hands of the despoiler. In time she returns home, pale, emaciated and weak.But the surgeon assures you that all she needs is time and rest.You are doomed to disappointment, for you find that time and thedoctor's knife has not improved her condition; on the contrary, sheis now more helpless than before you spent her vitality and yourmoney. You tell the jeweler the condition of your watch. He speaks of his years of apprenticeship, of his experience in business; that hecan take the works of a watch all out, and did so with yours; befound that it had too many wheels, which made it run too fast, andthat probably there are too many in there yet; if you will let himhave it once more he will call in some of his neighbors of likecraft, who are well skilled in that line. They will examine it withan eye glass to see just what the trouble really is. Thus you arepersuaded to again leave your watch. Your family physician calls on you and tells you that he possibly did not take out the right organ, and advises you to returnher to the hospital; they will hold a consultation and ad- 76ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS vise with the medical staff which will determine to a certainty just what and how much should be removed. You again yield yourbetter judgment to one in whom you have all confidence and she isagain taken from home and friends. In the meantime your watch is returned, or rather what was left of it. It no longer looks like the perfect timepiece you once carriedwith so much pride when everyone admired it and thought it such abeauty. The case is battered and full of wrinkles ; it bears noresemblance to its former self ; it is ruined beyond all possibility ofrepair. Your mother, wife or daughter, as the case may be, is again brought home, or at least what is left of her, but she bears noresemblance to the person you once thought to be the ideal ofhealth and beauty. She is no longer able to walk or take a step; isonly a shadow of her former self. Her haggard, careworn lookspeaks too plainly of her dreadful experience. The physician tellsyou that the operation was a wonderful success, and then adds,\"We have done all we can; give her the best of care while shelasts.\" We have drawn upon our imagination to find a man who lacks judgment sufficient to allow a tinker to meddle with and destroyhis watch. We have also had to fancy the quack jeweler; for, infact, we could not find either of these two characters. But there isno need of doing so in the medical profession, for the above is anevery-day occurrence. The watch was a fine piece of machinery.How much more so was the woman? If all parts of the watch werein their proper place, all in right position as when it came from thefactory, it would keep correct time. The woman's skeletal frame was all right until perhaps, not mindful of it, some portion of her spinal column became displacedby a wrench. If something is wrong with your watch you take it toa man who can fix it. He adjusts the displaced parts and then it isall right. Why not repair the human machine and give it the same sensible adjustment you did the watch? It is just as easy to do oneas the other when you know how. But, let us return and examine the ruined watch and the remains of the woman. We find the watch corroded and gummed inside;two cogs and a wheel gone and the mainspring broken; no wonderit would not run. Let us go to the postmortem of the woman, or what is left of her. A half dozen wise college graduates are present with theirknives, saws, etc. They proceed to open the body as they havedone before. They know where, for there are the telltale scarsgiving their mute testimony of former operations. They find twoovaries, the uterus and spleen gone, and the balance of the organsso destroyed with poisons which were given her that to examinethem and take notes of a clinical lecture offers an instructive lessonto the graduating class. They wonder why she did not live withoutthe parts that were removed. 77THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC The remainder of the watch is laid on the shelf as a reminder of your folly and ignorance. What was left of the woman you onceloved is buried in the churchyard. The doctors had done all theycould; they gave her the best of medical aid; physiced, bled, blistered and followed her with the science of medicine; chasedher life through all the mysterious windings of art; foresworeNature, shut the door in her face to keep out the fresh air,blindfolded the windows to exclude the invigorating light, refusedher cold water to drink and gave her only dainty foods prepared bythe chemist. Such substances irritated her internal organs, tocorrect which they counter-irritated the external organs.

NUTTING (\"Uncle Howard\"). 78ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS The writer saw an incident on Main street, Davenport, Iowa, which caused much ill-humor, amusement and some instruction tothe I crowd which witnessed it. Human Nature, the quality ofwhich depends upon education, was shown by each one presentinghis peculiar idea of the situation and his suggestions. Main street is paved with brick and is quite steep between Sixth and Eighth. A crowd of idle men had gathered on the street towatch a stalled team. I, of course, joined them. The horses wereonce full of life and vigor, but now they are thin of flesh, showingwant of care and lack of ambition. They are hitched to a good wagon, which contained a heavy load. They had gone half way up the hill, but could go no further. The driver did not know whatcourse to pursue. Several of the bystanders were eager to assisthim with their counsel. Their varied suggestions only served toconfuse him. The reader will notice closely the advice given, for itwill be made use of hereafter. The first instruction was to apply the whip; which was used unsparingly. It excited and aroused what energy they had left, but only worried them without any gain. The next order given and acted upon was to back down the hill, so as to give them a new start. This was tried, with the result that they were not able to make as far up the grade as before. A professional-looking man then said, \"Blindfold the horses, shake the wagon, throw something heavy on the pavement; make them believe that you have unloaded. If they think the wagon is empty, they will pull it up the hill easily. But, try as hard as theymight, they could not pull the load. The next man to offer advice was a clerk from a nearby drug store. He thought the axles and wheels needed oiling; that the wheels were tired instead of the horses. A supply of oil wassecured and applied to the axles and wheels plentifully, whichseemed to make the wagon more inclined to slide down the hill. Then there appeared in the front of the crowd a seeming wise fellow who looked as though he was a graduate from some collegeor a president of some hospital board. He argued the case asfollows: \"No team on earth can pull that load'; there is too much wagon, make it as light as possible, take off the spring seat, take out the end-gate and all the loose rods, saw out half the spokes, forthey are crowding each other; take off the tires, for they only serveto make extra weight; the fewer pieces you have in the wagon themore easily it will move.\" But, fortunately, before the well-dressedman's advice was put in action, there appeared a practical farmerwho took in the situation at a glance. He spoke in a mild tone, butwhat he said carried force and was convincing. He said: \"Let thatwagon remain whole, not one piece of it can be spared at this timewhen it is so loaded. Wipe off that surplus oil; throw the whip inthe 79THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC gutter; cease to blindfold the horses.\" When this was done, he calmly said to the driver, \" Now take off the brake.\" It was released. The team made the top of the hill with the usual speed and ease.The farmer was heard to say, \"That is easy to do when you knowhow.\" The crowd dispersed, being benefited more or less by theexperience. This may seem to the reader a simple and ridiculous story; but let us see if there are not incidents in our daily life fully asludicrous and absurd. Please observe that woman with pale, hollow cheeks and sunken eyes. A few years ago her cheeks were plump and full ofcolor, her eyes sparkled with ambition. She is trying her best toclimb the incline of life. She has her burden to carry as the most ofwomen have, but that which used to be comparatively play is nowa load she cannot move. She is discouraged and disheartened.Physically and mentally she has not the strength accomplish herusual labor, and yet she does not realize what is holding her back. Under all circumstances Human Nature is very much alike. Human sympathy is manifested and advice freely given to theafflicted in much the same way as was manifested in the crowdreferred to on Main street. Strangers as well as acquaintances areready, willing and eager to advise this frail woman what to do.Some recommend stimulants of various kinds to whip up the circulation and excite the already overworked woman. A well-meaning friend advises some kind of physic that will deplete her system, thinking it necessary for her to get away down in order to make permanent improvement. Some advise narcotics to deaden the sensibility of the physical; others suggest therapeutics or Christian Science, for the purpose ofmaking her believe that she has no disease. None of these reallyassist the invalid, for they do not release the brake. There are those who will advise blistering, bleeding or lubricating the body with liniments, just to be doing something, for what purpose they know not. Sooner or later the wise men are called in. With ready hands and sharpened knives they desire to cut out any or all parts thatthey think can be spared, believing that the less organs that theblood has to support and pass through, the purer it will be. But, thanks to the sensible farmer (Chiropractor), who realizes that there is a cause for all human ailments, and dares to say it in the presence of those standing by, who advise therapeuticalremedies, \"Take off the brake.\" We think it strange that no one in the crowd at the wagon thought of taking off the brake. It looks equally strange to a Chiropractor that until twenty-five years ago, no one discoveredthat a brake is set on some one of the 300 articular joints of thebody, compressing the nerves, thereby deranging their functions. 80ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS If, by any means, the articular surfaces of any of the joints of the skeletal frame, especially those of the vertebral column,become displaced by being wrenched, go to a Chiropractor, whowill take off the brake. The Old School idea of disease is, that it is an enemy that has to be fought, conquered, banished; while Chiropractic kindly says.. \"Take off the brake\u2014remove the pressure\u2014 and health is your compensation.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A LINE SHAFT. Mr. Brown was a wealthy philanthropist. He desired to give employment to his less prosperous neighbors, so he built a largemanufacturing plant. The building was large and commodious andmade of the best material; the boilers and engines were second tonone. The line shaft which carried the pulleys for the machinery was perfectly true and laid in solid masonry. The bearings in theaxle boxes were of the best adapted material; the machinery was ofthe latest improved patterns. The plant employed a large numberof workmen and produced a special line of goods which were sentto all parts of the world. This plant established a reputation forreliability and first-class work. Mrs. Brown was his silent partner, jointly the two had built a large and prosperous business. She was robust, stout and healthy,always did her own housework, and found time to assist Mr.Brown in his business. At the end of ten years the foreman reported that the center journal of the line shaft was heating, which necessitated a shut down until it was adjusted. The nearest expert was called in a man who had graduated from one of the best millwright schools. Hecarefully examined the machinery in the various parts of thebuilding and took the temperature and vibrations of the line shaft. He gave the following directions: \"Use no solid fuel in yourfurnace, burn only a little cotton waste and oil; make just enoughsteam to run the machinery very slowly. In the hot box use thefollowing lubricants and alternate every three hours tallow,diamond oil, plumbago, and cottonseed oil. Continue thistreatment for twenty-one days and it will cool off at the expirationof that time. I will call twice a day and take the temperature and vibrations of the heated journal and watch for complications. Bad luck never comes alone. Mrs. Brown was taken sick with fever. Dr. Allo was called in. He, with care, feels the pulse, takesthe temperature and asks many questions, from which hedetermines that she has typhoid fever, and prescribes thefollowing: \"Under no circumstances allow her to use any solidfood in any form. Her diet must be very light, consisting of liquidssuch as gum arabic Water, a weak solution of sago, or oatmealgruel. For a change she may be allowed the juice of sweet grapesor oranges, ice water and cold lemonade. At the end of 81THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC the second week, if she becomes very weak, she may be given thick gruels flavored with nutmeg, or a tablespoonful of milk andlime water every hour. If she becomes exceedingly low, give her asmall quantity of beef tea. I will call two or three times a day, takethe temperature, pulse, respiration and see how she gets along, asthis is an interesting case.\" Mr. Brown returns to the manufacturing plant, finds the men laid off for three weeks, and all orders for goods canceled. Thestagnation of business is more than Mr. Brown can willinglysubmit to, so he sends for several experts, who arrive and hold aconsultation, The journals, gudgeons, pivots, bearings and deadcenters are examined. They discuss superincumbent positions,causation, statics, dynamics, energetics, kinetics and the laws force and motion, the coefficient of expansion,mechanism, kinematics, elementary and aggregate combinations,acceleration and retardation of vibratory motion and compositionof deviations. The book-wise experts differ on every phase of thetrouble except the one on time. On that they all agree; that therewill be no change in the heating of the journal in less than twenty-one days, and in two or three weeks more, if all goes well, theplant may resume work. This being the unanimous decision, thequestion then arose as to what were the best lubricants for theaffected journal. A score or more of different kinds weresuggested, which brought on a discussion as to vegetable andanimal oils, some asserting that those of the animal were tooviscous, others that the vegetable was too thin. While this meeting of the learned scientists was being held, Mr. Brown was looking after his wife's welfare. He was not fullysatisfied with the prognosis of Dr. Allo. He could not think of hiswife lying in bed burning with fever for twenty-one days, and then,if alive, would need a few weeks to recuperate. So he called in,one by one, Dr. Homeo, Dr. Electric, Dr. Hydro, and Dr. Herbal.While they differed very much as to which was the best method oftreatment, they did not agree in etiology, pathology, diagnosis andprognosis, viz.: that the cause of the typhoid fever was amicroscopic vegetable organism which got into the body much inthe same way as the bug got into the boy's watch between theticks; that there would be a change in twenty-one days, they hopedfor the better, and Mrs. Brown would be around again in two orthree months. Mr. Brown looked serious and demurred at theprobability of his wife being compelled to lie in bed for so long atime. To have the plant shut down a month was a financial loss,but to have his wife wasting away with fever, existing between lifeand death, nearly distracted him. Almost delirious, he goes over to the plant and finds the meeting of the expert scientists in an uproar. The foreman hasheard of a master mechanic who could adjust and fix themachinery. He had arrived and made an examination of the line shaft, and found that the boxing had slipped a little to one side, causing it to bind, creating friction and heat; that all it needed 82ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS was adjusting. He said he could fix it, have it cooled off, and the men all at work in a few hours. The proprietor and the expertswere surprised to hear such a statement from a man who had nevertaken a college course in physics, but he had a knowledge sosystematized that he could predict and verify by measurement andobservation a clear perception of facts as they were. The bookexperts all agreed that such conditions always did and alwayswould take twenty-one days before a change would be observed;that it was one of the immutable laws. While no two thought alikeas to which mode of treatment was best, they were all agreed as tothe time limit. The proprietor, being nervous and anxious abouthis wife, told the mechanic to go ahead and fix it, ordered the foreman to notify the men to report the next morning, and thefireman to have steam up. The mechanic adjusted the box in a fewminutes and presented his bill, which was promptly paid. Mr. Brown returned to his residence in deep thought. He had often heard of a hand-fixer named Chiropractor, who had quickresults. Why not call him? Possibly he might find the cause ofMrs. Brown's illness and fix it as readily as the mechanic did the line shaft over at the plant. Dr. Chiro was called and made an analysis of Mrs. Brown's spine and found a subluxated vertebra, a displacement, of the articular surfaces which had in part lost theirproper connection. This made a local excessive heat and causedall the symptoms which the other doctors called typhoid fever. Ittook Dr. Chiro but a minute to fix it. As he said, \"To know how todo a thing is to be able to do it.\" Mr. Brown was so well pleasedwith Dr. Chiro's analysis of Mrs. Brown's case that he invited himto be seated in his cosy sitting room, where they chatted for half anhour. Mrs. Brown's fever had gone down, and supper was ready,so the doctor was invited to take tea. Mrs. Brown arose, dressedand seated at the table, ate her accustomed meal. It is needless tosay that Mr. Brown again wore his usual smile. The plant and hiswife would only lose one day each by the mechanical displacements, which were corrected by intelligent mechanics who understood their business. We have drawn on our imagination for the misdoings at the plant, but such short-sightedness of the medical men is of dailyoccurrence.. Chiropractors are fixing typhoid fever and other acutediseases in one or two brief adjustments. All M. D.'s fevers aretheir measurements of increased heat and oversupply of caloricfurnished by the calorific nerves, the heat function performed inexcess because of impingement of nerves. These displacementsare replaced by hand adjustments. Chiropractic opens a field ofvast possibilities for the future welfare of mankind. By manystudents it is considered to be the greatest discovery of the presentcentury. To do such is easy when you know how and have thepractice. Self-limited diseases are those in which doctors are unable to lesson the accustomed number of days they usually run. Why 83THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC cannot they abbreviate the usual course? All medical schools teach that certain diseases limit themselves; that no known treatment willabbreviate nor materially change their course; that certainsymptoms will arise under treatments which are entirely opposite.In other words, the self-limited diseases have their allotted numberof days to run under any kind of therapeutical remedies, becausenot one of those schools with their treatment know how to removethe cause; not one of them knows the reason for acute self-limiteddiseases. The causes are not external, they are in the patient; arecaused by something wrong\u2014a screw loose somewhere.Something is wrong or this human machine would run smoothly,without friction or heat. There are certain portions of the bodyinflamed because the nerves of that part are impinged by theinjury. Where is the pressure that causes nerves to producediseased condition? We answer that question: locate the injury,find the wrong and adjust it. \"The self-limited diseases\" arelimited, cut short, because the displaced vertebra has beenreplaced. Pneumonia, typhoid, smallpox, or any other acutedisease can be returned to normal function by adjusting the cause. Subluxated vertebrae pinch the nerves; impinged nerves represent the cause of disease. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 CHIROPRACTIC VERSUS THERAPEUTICS. It is unlike all known methods of therapeutics, so much so that it is not a therapeutical agency. Osteopathy is the only systemwhich has any similarity. One of The P. S. C. students (an Osteopath for six years), said: \"The methods of Chiropractic andOsteopathy differ in application and results, as well as in name.There is no resemblance in the treatment, and but little in any wayexcept the philosophy. The application of the two is so differentthat learning either one gives no clue to the other.\" In 1874 Dr. Still stated his observations as follows: \"A disturbed artery marks the period to an hour, and minute, whendisease Begins to sow its seeds of destruction in the human body.That in no case could it be done without a broken or suspendedcurrent of arterial blood, which by nature is intended to supply andTourist all nerves, ligaments, muscles, skin, bones, and the arteryitself. The rule of the artery must be absolute, universal andunobstructed, or disease will be the result. All nerves dependwholly upon the arterial system for their qualities, such assensation, nutrition and motion, even though by the law ofreciprocity, they furnish force, nutrition and sensation to the arteryitself.\" Journal of Osteopathy, May, 1904, page 196, says: \"How Osteopathy Treats the Blood.\" \"It is well known that pure blood is an absolute essential for health. The blood is the medium whereby all organs and parts ofthe body are supplied with nourishments for repair and growth. 84ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS \"There are five ways, at least, how the blood is influenced and treated by Osteopathy. \"The general Osteopathic treatment is something more than a modified combination of massage and Swedish movements.Simply something more by virtue of additional manual spinalcolumn stretching and rib separating.\" From this we will see that Osteopathy is a combination of massage, Swedish movements, \"spinal column stretching and ribseparating.\" \"Osteopathy also offers much along the line of treatment rendering and keeping the blood germicidal.\" Osteopathic Health says, page 315: \"Altered blood flow means disease, the body is such a machine. It becomes as clear as daylight, then, why the Osteopathist finds that most diseases are associated at basis with an abnormal blood flow.\" The P. S. C. teaches that: \"Whenever a nerve is injured or interfered with in any way, at that minute its function becomesabnormal, and sooner or later, with more or less effect, it makesconditions of abnormal functions in that portion of the body wherethose nerves end. Mental impulses control all actions of not onlythe ligaments, muscles, skin, mucous membrane and bones, butalso the blood itself, for the arteries and veins are supplied withnerves which convey mental impulses that regulate the amount ofblood sent to any part by contracting and relaxing the vasculartissue. Because nerves convey this control, all normal sensations,nutrition and motion depend upon mental impulses instead ofblood. Hence, it necessarily follows that the human body is not a blood machine, as has been taught by all schools of medicine,including the Osteopaths, but a nerve machine run throughout allits parts by mental impulses.\" The Pacific School of Osteopathy says: \"The legal definition of Osteopathy is a system, method or science of treating humandiseases.\" Chiropractors do not treat diseases, they adjust the wrong which creates disease; they have discovered the simple fact that the human body is a sensitive piece of machinery, runthroughout all its parts by mental impulse. That disease is acondition in which Innate Intelligence is trying to carry on its workof growth and repair with the human machine out of order. OSTEOPATHY AS DEFINED BY DR. A. T. STILL. Journal of Osteopathy, Kirksville, Mo.: \"Dr. Still reasoned that a natural flow of blood is health, and disease is the effect of localor general disturbance of blood; that to excite the nerves causesmuscles to contract and compress venous flow of blood to theheart; and the bones could be used as levers to relieve pressure ofnerves, veins and arteries.\" OSTEOPATHY AS DEFINED BY DR. A. P. DAVIS. Osteopathy Illustrated, page II.: \"Diseases are recognized as only the result of the interruption of the onward flow of the 85THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC fluids of the body, in their various rounds to build up and tear down the various tissues in itself, and that when these tissues arenormally built up and the waste material property eliminated,health is the inevitable result.\" CHIROPRACTIC AS DEFINED BY THE P. S. C . Historical\u2014 The first accidental crude Chiropractic adjustment of a vertebra was given in September, 1895, by Dr. D. D. Palmer.Neither the art nor the science was formed at this time. Its growthremained practically dormant till 1903, since which time his son,B. J. Palmer, D. C., Ph.C., has developed it into a well definednon-therapeutical philosophy, science and art that has noresemblance whatever to any therapeutical method. Health(equality) is restored by completing the mental and physicalcircuit; restoring the currents of cycles of mental impulses actingthrough the material agency; to replace the full quota of positivewith an equivalent negative; permitting the reconveyance of theintelligent the mechanical corporeal; toreconstruct the normal psycho-physical unit; to make as one thetrinity of creation, transmission and expression; to re-establishequilibrium between the abstract and concrete, all of which isinduced by replacing specific disordered concrete mechanicalanatomy which permits adjustment between that one law of twoprinciples\u2014cause and effect\u2014the rules and manner of declarationof which are unique and unlike any theories of stimulative orinhibitive movements or applications used by any other school. Defined\u2014 Chiropractic is a name given to the study and application of a universal philosophy of biology, theology,theosophy, health, disease, death, the science of the cause ofdisease and art of permitting the restoration of the triunerelationships between all attributes necessary to normal compositeforms, to harmonious quantities and qualities by placing injuxtaposition the abnormal concrete positions of definitemechanical portions with each other, by hand, thus correcting allsubluxations of the three hundred articulations of the humanskeletal frame, more especially those of the spinal column, for thepurpose of permitting the recreation of all normal cyclic currentsthrough nerves that were formerly not permitted to be transmitted,through impingement, but have now assumed their normal size andcapacity for, conduction as they emanate through intervertebralforamina\u2014the expressions of which were formerly excessive orpartially lacking\u2014named disease. All movements, whether normal or abnormal of, or in the body (including blood circulation), are but the personification of mentalequivalents\u2014mental functions guided by Innate Intelligence,creating physical expression. All ache or pain is but theintellectual interpretation placed upon impressions received fromthe periphery concerning the abnormal physical conditions. Every act and thought is controlled by Innate Intelligence through the medium of the brains and their prolongations\u2014 86ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS nerves\u2014to tissue. It is the life of the body when transformed by the brain. We are well when Innate Intelligence has unhindered freedom to act through the physical brain, nerves and tissues. Disease is lack of normal functions. Innate mental impulses control the vital functions of assimilation, circulation and respiration, asleep or awake. Dreamsare sensations interpreted by the same discriminating force. Diseases are caused by a lack of current of innate mental impulses. This is produced by a constricting force placed around nerves through accident\u2014vertebral subluxations. Thesedisplacements are caused by a concussion of forces, the external meeting the resistance of the internal, induced by traumatism. The above is given for those who think there is no difference between Chiropractic and Osteopathy. It will be readily seen thatOsteopathy, like Allopathy, is founded on the delusion, \"the bloodis the life.\" Chiropractors state that mental impulses are the manifestations of life of the body, that it is controlled in every act and thought by innate and educated minds, that the body is heated by calorificmental impulses, whether the heat is furnished in normal quantityas in health, or abnormal amounts, as in so-called fevers, which isbut excessive heat in those parts of the whole of the body. A Chiropractor is a hand practitioner; he adjusts displaced parts, he repairs a disordered human machine, he puts in order andsets to right the displaced bones of the skeletal frame which are notin their proper position. He does this by hand, and that is exactlywhat Chiropractic means\u2014hand fixing. A Chiropractor does not operate on, manipulate or treat a watch, sewing machine or the human machine for any wrongdoing. He adjusts, repairs, fixes with his hands the displaced partsof the machine, whether human or inanimate. The jeweler wouldthink you daft if you were to request him to treat your watch. Hewould ask you if you did not want it adjusted, repaired, fixed. Machinists do not operate, manipulate or treat when they adjust a pinion, wheel, axle or other part of a machine; neither does a Chiropractor treat, manipulate or operate when he replaces asubluxated joint or vertebra. All therapeutic methods, including Osteopathy, treat effects, symptoms, ailments, nervousness, lack of ease; these are but theresults of an altered human mechanism, derangement of the humanmachine, producing uneasiness, pain and distress, causing adisturbance of the normal performance of the vital functions. Chiropractors find that all illness, sickness, affections, indisposition, complaint, maladies or lack or innervation, theresults or consequences of disorder, derangement or some part ofthe human frame. 87THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Osteopaths manipulate, operate and treat. The June number of Journal of Osteopathy, 1905, page 202, says: \"Osteopathic manipulation for the relaxation of tissues, the stimulation of nervesand nerve centers and the liberations of blood current.\"Chiropractors never relax or stimulate nerves by manipulation. Donot write or talk about liberating obstructed blood currents.Osteopathic literature does not read like hand fixing, like adjustingdisplaced parts to their proper relation to other parts. The Osteopath, by rubbing, kneading, pressing and a general overhauling, by neck twisting, arm and leg wringing, aims toinhibit or stimulate nerves, whip up circulation, slow up orstimulate the action of the heart, and other organs. The M. D.'s tryto produce precisely the same effect by drugs. Chiropractors neverdeaden, inhibit or stimulate nerves, or the vital organs of the body;they free nerves from impingement, so that their impulses may benormal. We do not prescribe or use medicines to treat disease or symptoms; the M. D.'s do. We do not use anything that a medical man employs or make any movements an Osteopath does. We do not manipulate; the masseur, magnetic and the Osteopath do. We repair the human machine by adjusting. When we adjust or fix a machine, whether human or inanimate, we donot treat it, we do not operate upon or manipulate it. All therapeutic methods, including Osteopathy, treat effects. Chiropractors do not treat effects, disease, people, nor anythingelse. They fix, adjust, repair, put to rights, replace, restore tonormal conditions. Effects can only be treated. Causes cannot be treated. They must be made right by replacing the subluxated bones where theybelong. All other schools claim to and do treat effects\u2014diseasedconditions; we fix, adjust the cause of those conditions, e. g., a person has a headache\u2014all others would treat the headache,Chiropractors find a subluxated cervical vertebra pressing on thenerves, causing the ache. By adjusting, we remove the pressure onnerves and the ache ceases. Symptoms are treated by alltherapeutists, but not by Chiropractors. Causes are never treated.They are, or at least should be, properly adjusted. You might treata boy or a watch to a bath for cleanliness; or a dose of medicine, ora dish of ice cream for an effect; but you would not treat asubluxated hip or vertebra, that should have its cause adjusted. If I am called to your house and find you in trouble because water is dripping on your furniture, books and carpets, even intothe cellar, rotting fruit and vegetables, what shall I do to help you?Shall I set a vessel and daily catch the water to see how long ittakes to fill a certain measure? Shall I count the drops to see howmany there are in a minute? Shall I make a chemical ormicroscopical analysis of the water for the purpose of showing thatI am a thoroughly equipped practitioner? Will it not 88ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS be of more value if, without preliminaries, I fix the leak in the roof, which is the cause of all the trouble? During the last twenty-five years many changes have been made in the methods of treating diseases, but the innovation, madeby Chiropractors, has been more radical than all the rest combined.They have made an entire transition. Instead of treating diseasethey adjust cause. Inaction or painful sensations of stomach, liver, kidneys and other organs are caused by nerves of innervation being pinched attheir exit from the spinal column. Freeing these nerves allowsmental impulse to act and innervate the vital parts; improvedigestion, assimilation and circulation; give strength, vigor andtone to the mental and physical, thus making men and womenbetter prepared to perform their business avocations. Why not find that which is wrong and make it right, instead of leaving the injured part untouched? Why not get a move on youand learn to do more than count the pulse to see how many morebeats there are this side of eternity? You will never find what iscreating disease by taking the temperature, respiration and thepulse, or by \"chemical and microscopical analysis of the secretionsand excretions,\" or by palpation, percussion and auscultation.These only tell the amount of morbid conditions which are theeffects from a cause. They only aid physicians to name thoseconditions. Why not find the cause and adjust it for a definitepurpose, thereby correcting the displacements? Chiropractic workshops are not operating, manipulating or treating rooms. We do not operate, manipulate or treat. Put inorder the displaced parts, reduce or bring portions of the humanmachine to a true relative position. A mechanic has appropriatelycalled our adjusting rooms \"repair shops,\" and this is exactly whatthey are. The Chiropractor adjusts the human nerve machine with an ease never acquired by any other system. M. D.'s give names todiseased conditions, according to combinations of symptoms. Thederangement of the human mechanism is the cause of any part ofthe body being affected with not ease. Let M. D.'s and otherscontinue to treat symptoms, play tag, chase them from one part ofthe body to another, until they learn to fix in proper position thosewhich have slipped out of place. The Osteopath treats bones, joints, muscles and nerves. Chiropractors adjust displaced parts, thus returning them to theirnormal position. The words \"operate,\" \"manipulate\" and \"treat\" are Allopathic, or more correctly speaking, are old school signboards. For aChiropractor to use them would be to mislead and deceive thepublic, our patients and ourselves. They do not express theChiropractic sentiments. Chiropractic, rightly understood and practiced, does not need assistance from any of the methods which treat, manipulate oroperate. 89THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC The following is copied from Dr. Still's book on Osteopathy, page 130: \"Rheumatism. Before it begins at the joints, you are sure to find that all gas has left the joints. Thus, electricity burns becauseof bone friction. Some gas must be between the bone joints. Thuswe find great use for atmospheric pressure to hold bones farenough apart to let the joint water pass freely over the opposingends of bones. There is a natural demand for gas in all healthyjoints of the body. Reason leads us to believe that gas isconstantly being conveyed to or generated in all joints: Beforerheumatism appears the separating gas has been exhausted andthere follows friction and electric heat because of there being twoor more joints in one electric circuit or division. \"We thus get what we call neuralgia, rheumatism, sciatica and so on to the full list of aches and pains not accounted for to date byour philosophers. \"On this plane of reason many rich harvests await the sickle of reason. On this plane you can see and know the whys ofconsumption, dropsy, tumors, fits, gray hair, baldness, and so on toa surprising number of diseases.\" The reader will see that there is no resemblance between the above and Chiropractic. We find the tangible cause for allailments in the disordered mechanism of the vertebral column.Chiropractic is the only method that exactly locates the cause ofdisease and removes it by hand adjustment. To illustrate more fully the difference between Medical and Osteopathic treatment, and that of Chiropractic adjustment, wewill briefly describe them: The medical doctors use hygienic measures to prevent the spread of diphtheria and vigorous treatment of swabbing the throatwith disinfectant solutions for the purpose of destroying bacilli.General or specific medication is used to counteract effects ofpoison created by decay of the bacteria, the complications andsequelae that is sure to follow. The Allopath and Osteopath agree on etiology and diagnosis, and differ only in the latter trying to do with his hands what theformer aims to do with drugs. They look upon diphtheria as anenemy that has to be \"combated\" with the most formidable gainsand ammunition in their armamentarium. The Osteopathic treatment for diphtheria consists of more than 200 different movements of \"general and special treatment,\" suchas pulling, stretching, rotating, raising clavicles and muscles, infact, a general overhauling of one and one-half hours. The objectis to prevent stagnation, equalize the circulation of the fluids. The reader will observe that the above schools treat the effects which are known as diphtheria. They agree as to bacilli being thecause. Chiropractors find that bacilli are there as result as much asmold found on decaying cheese. 90ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Chiropractors understand that necrosed membrane is the result of excessive heat, commonly named inflammation; that diphtheriais caused by those nerves which end in the membrane of the throatbeing pressed upon in a right dorsal foramen, which is occludedbecause of deleterious substances acting upon sensory nerves,which in cyclic turn affect the motor. Abnormal sensations induceabnormal actions. Abnormal sensations act on adjacent vertebrae,displacing them, impinging nerves, which express their injury byan inflamed condition of their terminal endings. The Chiropractor replaces the displaced vertebrae by one move, which is distinctly Chiropractic. Excessive heat is reduced; thesymptoms known as diphtheria cease. Wherein does Chiropracticresemble Allopathy or Osteopathy? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 INNATE INTELLIGENCE. Each individual has two distinct and separate minds, the Innate and the Educated, both the expression of Innate Intelligence.These thinking forces existing in the same body are closelyassociated and while Innate influences the Educated, theconditions are not vice versa. The intelligence of the Educated mind is wholly acquired\u2014 learned by experience. The Innate is not acquired. It is bornwithin and with us, and it is as capable of running all functions ofthe body at birth as in adult life. It is not obtained by experience,but is inherent and does not depend upon years of observation. Some have but little of the Educated, but the Innate performs all the functions of the body in a manner which the inventors andphilosophers would be glad to enjoy. Nature, instinct, subconscious mind and intuition are terms often used to carry this idea of intelligence, but they do not expressthe sentiment fully. The mother, whether human or of the lower order of animals, transmits the Innate to her offspring, but it takes a lifetime toeducate the voluntary mind. All organized living beings endowed with the interpretation of the senses, and the innervation, assimilation, circulation, nutrition,calorification, reparation, excretion, secretion, and respiration, areunder the control of and managed by Innate, except in cases whereInnate nerves are affected by being pinched and pressed upon,causing abnormal functions. Such need mechanical adjustment,not chemical changes made by drugs. Innate comprehends that birth is a transition from mother dependence to self-existence; that they (he or she) no longerdepend upon her for the performance of vital functions; they mustbreathe, take nourishment, digest and assimilate it and 91THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC pass the refuse out of the body. These various functions are performed as naturally with as much intelligence on the first day ofits existence as in after years. Often Innate and the Educated differ in their opinions of the same subject, e. g., in normal condition the bowel actions areunder the control of Innate, but because of subluxated vertebraethe nerves of bowel innervation are inactive, being pressed upon inthe intervertebral foramina, consequently there is lack of action,usually named constipation. Innate would like to have Educatedrelieve that pressure and restore innervation, but because hissenses are warped by years of training, he proceeds to give aphysic, compelling Innate to collect water and wash the intruderout by the way of the bowels. Innate finds an undesirable drugforced down the throat and into the stomach much against hissense of right and proceeds to get rid of an objectionable dose.The poison does not act upon the stomach and bowels, but Innateacts on it. Innate intelligence never sleeps. It runs all the vital functions of our bodies night and day, by and through nerves. If these werefree to act in a natural manner, we would not know an ache, painor any of the symptoms of disease. The life-power and forcewould not be obstructed and normal. Innate is the body builder before as well as after birth. The Educated directs the thoughts that are above and outside of thematerial body. The prospective mother, seeing abnormal sights, transmits thoughts, involuntarily, of the spectacle to the Innate builder,which constructs a portion of the unborn just as the mother hasstrongly impressed it to do. This is commonly known as naevus,marking the child, material imagination of the foetus in utero. Heretofore it has been supposed that the mother transmits her thoughts directly to the unborn, but the facts are that the Educatedmay receive impressions which, when interpreted by Innate, maybe directed to form the child not only in its physical makeup, butalso in its sensational likes or dislikes. Impressions may bereceived through the Educated or Innate brain and interpreted byInnate Intelligence, which will influence the development of thechild. If the mother is acquainted with this law, she will exclude all directions that are not to her liking, and direct aright the futurephysical and mental inclinations of her offspring. Remember that these two separate and distinct intellects, whether sane or insane, good or evil, stamp their thoughts more orless upon each other. We can see and study much of the work ofInnate Intelligence by an examination of the osteologicalspecimens at The P. S. C. Space will permit only a brief description of a few specimens in order to understand the management of osteology by Innate. 92ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS To an observer this department is truly wonderful. A calvarium (top of a skull) shows on both sides of the inner surfaces beautifulpictures of forest fires, as perfect as though drawn by an artist, thefire and smoke being of natural color, the production of Innate'sintellect, by building vimineous arborescent exostoses. This unique monstrosity is an extraordinary piece of work. To be fully appreciated it must be seen and explained. On page 134 is a cut of the fourth and fifth ribs of the right side. These have eight healed fractures. The fourth shows two,the fifth a comminuted fracture at salient angle. Innate repairedthese fractures, doing good work with all of them excepting theone shown in the center of the fifth rib. These fragments were notin the proper position. Not being a mechanics it could not adjustthe displaced pieces; Educated should have done that;nevertheless, it did the best it could with the conditions imposedupon it. It filled in the vacant space with interposed callus, but thepieces not being in right position, the osteoanaplerosis was notperfect. The symphysis was weak and liable to break. Tostrengthen this weak place it built a pier (exostosis) from each ribtoward and touching the other. These surfaces were covered withhyaline cartilage, making a very nice movable brace similar to thatwhich a carpenter would build to strengthen a weak place in ajoist, except that it did not make a stiffness of the two ribs byankylosing, yet it had all the benefits of a brace. The educatedman knew nothing of this brace built between the ribs by thisrepairer. It showed intelligent architectural reasoning, usingjudgment and skill in adopting means to accomplish the purposeintended. We have an atlas and axis, the first two vertebrae next to the head, which show Innate intelligence and ability in coping withexisting difficulties. By an accident the anterior of the atlas wasdisplaced upward, causing it to make a facet on the odontoid forarticulation. This fact was so near the top of the processusdentatus that there was great liability of this atlas slipping up overit and backward against the spinal cord, which would cause instantdeath. In this it shows reason, judgment and skill in elongating theprocess to prevent such fatality; and yet the Educated man knewnothing of this internal work. A Chiropractor would have replacedthe atlas to its normal position. The P. S. C. has over one thousand specimens of fractures which show repairs by Innate under favorable and unfavorableapposition. If some of these could talk they would tell of bunglingwork done by the M. D.'s, who manipulated them before Innategot a chance to do its work. It is interesting to a pathologist to note the various changes in the shape of the different parts of the vertebrae resulting from itsadaptation to some displacement which Innate was not able toadjust, and the physician did not know how. This intelligencedisplays much and varied intellect in the many locks found in 93THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC the vertebral column to prevent the further displacement of an already subluxated vertebra, one of which is as nice a dovetail asany artificer could make. Very many times we find the vertebraeankylosed by osseous symphysis for the purpose of preventing anyfurther displacement. Innate is not an external corrector, therefore,it cannot replace them. These osseous unions are removed by itafter Chiropractors replace the subluxated vertebrae to their formernatural position. In four rachitic specimens of tibia and fibula, which have been bent while softened by excessive heat (the M. D.'s fever), causingbow legs, we find a corresponding flattening (platycnemia) of thefibula to compensate and strengthen its fragile mate. In femorawhich have been weakened and curved by incomplete fractures, wefind the linea aspera built out in a pier to compensate forweakness. 94ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS To say that this intelligence displayed by Innate is nothing but nature, instinct, or intuitive force, does not meet ourcomprehension. The immense variety of monstrosities which are created or built by this intelligence opens a boundless field for observation andresearch. Different kinds of work in various parts of the human body are performed by mental impulses that have various functions.Occasionally when long bones are fractured the fragments do notunite, the callous material is not supplied. The M. D.'s try variousexpedients to unite, but they experiment in vain, for they do notknow why the osseous mater (symphysis material) is not supplied.Chiropractors who have studied morbid functions of nerves wouldknow why the necessary material for uniting these fractures wasnot supplied and would be able to assist these useless repair nervesto their normal function and usefulness. These conditions, referred to as showing intelligence, do not include deformities, abnormal growths, and exostoses caused byoverheat and excessive nutrient supply by deranged functions. Apart of all of the skeletal frame may be softened by superheat (theM. D.'s fever), a portion of the bone may ooze out and bedeposited on the surface, causing morbid enlargement andankyloses. When the heat becomes less than normal, we find thethird stage, that of hardening, consolidations and eburnation;functions performed in excessive or insufficient amount. Some diseases are the morbid condition of Innate mental impulse, while others are of the abnormal sensibility of theEducated, the distinction being known by perceiving whether theabnormal conditions that exist are produced when asleep or awakeadaptatively or pathologically. Hypnotists put the Educated in a condition of steep and draw from Innate by Suggestions. All cures made by Faith, ChristianScience, Metaphysics, Charms, Mental Healers, Magnetics orSuggestions are produced by the Innate controlling the Educatedphysical. Many persons in whom the Innate is prerogative assertthemselves in thought over and above the Educated, compellingthe Educated Mental to believe the possessor is ailing. It is a poorrule that won't work both ways. If you would comprehend diseased conditions of the vital organs, study the Innate functions. The old blood delusion ofdiseases, or the present fad of microbes, bacteria, and bugs, doesnot explain intelligently the unpleasant sensations. Innate intelligence knows much more of the normal actions and morbid conditions of the stomach, liver, kidneys, pancreas, spleenor appendix than the medical world. If all parts of the human machine are adjusted to their normal position, then Innate can use them in a natural manner to performall the various functions of the different organs; but the M. D.'spresent fad is to remove any diseased organ that the 95THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC afflicted can do without. Too often the patient's friends find, when too late, the fatal mistake. Dreams are thoughts of Innate mind afterwards remembered by the developed mind, varying more or less, owing to the vividimpressions made upon them. Innate does not study but one of the two forces necessary to induce a subluxation; does not set displaced or fractured bones, butafter a Chiropractor replaces them it will absorb and removeuseless exostoses or other temporary protections which are nolonger needed, and puts to natural use those functions whichbefore were useless or deranged. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. CHIROPRACTICALLY CONSIDERED. At birth two mentalities have the present and future control of the body. Involuntary and Voluntary, or Innate and Educatedminds. The latter is under control of the will; the former is not.Each has a separate brain. In considering functions as Involuntary we mean not under the control of voluntary man. They are involuntary to him, yetvoluntary to Innate. Each brain has a separate set of nerves. We have five or more senses of the physical, corresponding to as many of the spiritual orInnate. The actions of these are voluntary functions to each mind.Whether they are for our benefit or detriment, depends upon theEducated mind. Through an accident the hand touches a hot stove. The \"involuntary\" mind, through sensory nerves, received theimpression and an involuntary motor mental impulse is to jerk thehand from the offender. This is done in less time than we areaware of it intellectually, before we have time, voluntarily, to thinkor reason about it. The movement of the bowels is involuntary. An impingement of the \"involuntary\" motor nerves paralyzes its functions andInnate has not power to act. A lack of involuntary action callsvoluntary sensory's attention, and the result is, voluntary motorassists the movement. You are not aware of this conditionprevious to Innate asking for help. Sympathetic nervous system, in name and functions, expresses no intelligence to a Chiropractor. To say that the stomach worksin sympathy with other organs shows ignorance. It would provethat there is no direct source from which each organ received itsmental energy. Physicians understand that functions are executed,but how and why has always been a mystery. Do they not knowthat all through the body are millions of nerve fibres receivingmental impulses which control all functions; that each fibril hasdirect connection with a specific lobe within its 96ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS brain, does not have relay stations in the spinal column; that it receives orders from one or the other mind and proceeds to carrythose impulses along the best path in the quickest manner and willdo so if not interfered with? Then he will have some intelligenceof how harmony exists equally in all organs at the same time,providing there are no mechanical obstructions. Brains are of different substances, proportion of impressions that are carried to them make different sensations and differentresponsive motor acts follow, thus manifesting individualidiosyncrasies. I understand the importance placed upon \"reflex action\" through \"relay stations\" in the spinal cord. \"Reflex\" means anaction without any apparent cause, as such is backed by intelligentdeductions. Sensory nerves carry external stimuli to either theInnate or Educated brains, the impression being according to thequantity of that impulse. \"Reflex action\" does not show any resultof thought. I would rather know that a function was performed asa result of an educational impulse, than to think it was the result ofa \"sympathetic reflex action.\" The nervous system may becompared to a tree. The acorn contains all the future elements ofthe oak. In that nut is the miniature tree which, when grown, hasas many fibrils above the ground as below. Could you take thesmallest one at the topmost branch, trace it downward through thetrunk, it would end in the ground. Dissection would prove thiswith every fibrilla. Chiropractic has demonstrated the sameprinciple with the two nervous systems. Nature and Innate use thesame instructive intelligence, varying only in degree. The infant at birth contains all the functions of the adult. Innate is as capable of running that body then as in after years. Time isneeded for the intellectual mind to develop. Every nerve fiber, inchild or adult, would be traceable if it could be dissected throughtissue, fascia, around ligaments and the bones to the spinal columnentering through the intervertebral foramina and into the spinalcord proceeding to its functional center in the brain. Thus allfibers continue their identity from the periphery to its epiphery orbeginning. The nervous system may be compared to a multiple telephone switchboard. In this each nerve has its specific location accordingto function. Caloric for the whole body is furnished from aspecific lobe; involuntary muscular action from another, etc. Fromeach lobe of the brain issues a small cable composed of multiplefibers, which contain all the nerves of that function for the entirebody. There is no division until it leaves the magnum foramen,then the process of division and subdivision goes on until everytissue of the body needing that function has been supplied. Thespinal cord at its exit from the skull contains all the nerve fibrils ofthe various functions. The trunk of a tree and the spinal cord are similar, spinal nerves, are as branches. From this they subdivide to all tissues, 97THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC conveying mental impulses which control all of the functions of the body. The feeder for the tree is ground; for body, the brain.Thus we prove the falsity of the spinal relay system. Its existencewould be superfluous, contrary to an established rule of Innate. Nature's principles are absolutely correct, to interpret them is simple, if on the right track; if not, research for years does notdemonstrate a single fact to the contrary. Some authors speak of three divisions of sensory and motor nerves; voluntary, involuntary and semi-voluntary. The first twomentioned are frequently together. Occasionally we find aninvoluntary organ having voluntary nerve fibers ending in it,giving voluntary use of an involuntary organ, thus explaining thelast mentioned. A notable example of this development can befound in the Egyptian Muscle Dancers, who have absolutevoluntary control of involuntary muscles and flex them at will. There are sets not in daily use, which are called for in case of necessity, like the fire department of a city. They are building andproperty savers. The reparatory nervous system has the samefunction to perform in the body. Called into play when abnormal,diseased or fractured parts need attention. A healthy body never calls this set into play. In this age a perfectly healthy system can not be found, any more than a citywithout fires. These reparatory impulses are under the control ofInnate. Fracture the femur, the Innate intelligence cannot replacethe splinters; therefore, it heals as it is, whether set or unset, and itis this function that is then brought into action. In indigestion,tissues are depleted from lack of nutrition, muscular walls areparalyzed, not allowing peristaltic movement caused byimpingement of those nerves as they emanate throughintervertebral foramina on their way to the stomach. AChiropractor adjusts the subluxation and immediately reparatoryimpulses are at work rebuilding. Previous to adjustment thereparatory process was endeavoring to right matters, butimpingement of those nerves acted as a check. Adjustmentreleased pressures and restored normal functions. Innate develops during our lifetime just so much as the voluntary nervous system places us in contact where shevoluntarily senses the pleasures of that with which she sees orfeels, etc. When we see, hear, smell, or fell, it is functionatedthrough two minds. Both sensory (the Educated and Innate) aresensing the same thing at the same time. If pleasant, Innaterelaxes, becomes receptive; if injurious, she rebels and forces itout. This acting depends some upon how our parents developedtheir Innate voluntarily, and how we are developing our Innatesnow will be noticeable in our children. This Innate sensory and motor nervous system never sleeps, will sense danger when our Educated system is asleep, and actupon it, thus showing, not reflex action, but Intelligence, deep 98ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS thought, upon the part of a superior control. You are now beginning to see the difference between two minds and theirexpressions through two independent nervous systems. They aredistinctly separated in functions, action, depth of observation andthinking powers. Each mind has a memory. You can voluntarily remember that which happened yesterday or many years ago.. The hypnotist putsto sleep the Educated nervous system and through involuntarysensory calls certain things to be brought forth, thus drawing fromInnate's memory what long ago was forgotten by the Educated.The involuntary motor responds to the sensory commandsreceived. Educated and Innate nerves do not, nor can they, communicate within the cranium. They have a constant communication throughperipheral endings of both sets. Sensory or motor, for either setintercommunicating that which is pleasant and worthy to take up,or acting upon that which is detrimental and should be forcedoutward, both working in perfect harmony (not \"sympathy\")unless, as occasion happens, our Educated thinks itself capable ofdictating to Innate what and how they ought to do. As a protective measure against the spinal subluxations, Innate, in building and developing the child, prenatally and postnatally,does not allow all functional nerves going to a given point to emitthrough the same foramen; thus, sensory of one and motor of theother exist above a certain vertebra and vice versa; then an existingsubluxation would only make abnormal the functions of nervesemanating through that foramen. The depth of thought or ability of the Voluntary or Educated mind is significant compared to the continued added knowledge ofeach life to the Innate; therefore, she knows and is more capable ofrunning this body, through nerves and their functions. Thiscombined knowledge of many generations senses, through Innatesensory nerve fibrils, a poison more quickly and better than theEducated sensory fibrils and will act upon it long before ourvoluntary sensory nerves are aware that that which was givenvoluntarily, to the body, was a damage. We frequently take poisons into the stomach in the form of solids or liquids, into the lungs as gases, or have injected vaccinevirus, which Innate immediately senses is damaging. This effectsinvoluntary sensory abnormally, impressing itself as such uponInnate. This involuntary sensory nerve bundle within the craniumhas its corresponding motor area; the latter tract now receivesabnormal sensations, making adaptation accordingly. This motor area controls motion produced by contraction of muscles; hence, we have an abnormal or excessive contractionalong the path of these nerves to which this bundle goes. This isthe chill or invasion period, which is the rigor of involuntarymuscles in their endeavors to throw off poisons, always preceding 99THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC all fevers. The greater the poisoning, in strength of quantity, the greater the chill and chronic results that follow. Pressure upon nerves exists only as they emerge between hard substances, the excessive contraction of muscles aroundintervertebral or spinal foramina produces the occlusion; pressureis the result. This is the second or period of fever, continuing untilearthy matter is burned out of the bones, after which therecuperative, desquamation, eburnating, or third period follows. Poison inhaled will produce fevers located in the chest, as pleurisy, lung fever, etc., the reason being that sensory and itscorresponding motor make a complete circuit by way of the brain,returning to the same tissue. This intelligently explains the how and why some fevers are contagious and run in epidemics. They are contagious so far asforeign substance produces a specific cause in the body whichmanifests fever effects. (See \"Cycles,\" Vol. 5.) The degree or progress of any disease depends entirely upon how great the pressure. It is an established mechanical principlethat light pressure stimulates; a heavy one paralyzes. In all diseases we have two divisions\u2014too much or not enough activity of one or more functions. Of the kidneys we have Bright'sdisease or diabetes; in the bowels, constipation or diarrhoea. We have explained how poisons can produce disease. Let us briefly study the opposite in understanding how massage, baths,magnetic treatment, etc., do in many instances relieve diseaseswithout giving Chiropractic adjustments. Poisons produce rebellious actions, excessive contractions. These follow the introduction of irritable substances. That whichis soothing, quieting, lulling or relieving produces a relaxedcondition of voluntary and involuntary muscular systems, puttingthe body in a complete receptive condition. The slightestmovements made when completely relaxed often produceaccidental adjustments, thus restoring functions as easily as if doneby a scientific adjustor. This can happen only in those cases wherethe vertebrae are not misshapen by arthritis. It is well known toChiropractors that when patients are relaxed an adjustment can begiven much easier than when braced. Innate has sensory and motor nerves in all parts of the body. Educated intelligence has nerves of each only in those parts thatcome in contact with the external, as head, the senses, extremities,anus, lungs, but none of the internal, digestive, assimilative,calorific, secretary, excretory, lymphatic or circulatory systems. Every fibril has its functions to perform; there is no anastomosing as in the circulation of the blood, A ganglion is atying place for fibers as they separate from the cable coming fromthe brain, where they originate. There is no act performed in the body but what is tinder the direct control of a voluntary brain system. 100ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Mental impulses in normal quantity mean perfect health to all tissues. All impulses originate in the brain, from there aretransmitted to the nerve fibril whose duty is to carry that functionthrough soft tissues to its nerve plates by means of which itexpresses the action or errand given to it. To have brain pressure is impossible unless external violence on the skull was previous. The spinal column is so composed thatit is impossible for the vertebrae to become completely separatedfrom their articulations without an accompanying fracture. Brainpressure and fracture of spine occur so seldom that we will notconsider them at present, but it is a daily occurrence to those soeducated to see the majority of people with subluxations existingwithout their knowledge. We have shown how one or more functions have nerve fibers coming through the same foramen, the kind of disease existing atnerve endings depending entirely upon the degree of pressure andcombination of functions involved. This accounts for the endlessamount of combinations in symptoms. It is these that physicians ofall schools wait to see develop before they can name the disease.Why? They have no knowledge of the cause. If they did, and hada Chiropractic education, they would adjust, and not wait forsymptoms to develop. They would fix the cause instead of treatingeffects. To have pressure, there must be a soft substance between two hard. There is no place in the body where nerves are entirelyclosed between two hard substances, as at the intervertebralforamina; therefore, 95 per cent of pressure is at this point. One hundred per cent of impulses is health. Produce a pressure of 30 per cent and the disease manifests an equal loss. This issickness, pure and simple. What ought to be done? Should westimulate the remaining 70 per cent by one of a thousand methods,aim to have the remainder do the work of 100 per cent? Is thatlogical and in accord with facts? No. A Chiropractor can adjustthat subluxation, release pressures upon nerves, restore impulses to100 per cent, after which Involuntary sensory, motor and otherfunctions will rebuild torn down tissues, repair parts to normal,and health is the inevitable result. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"Pressure on A live nerve, like a live wire, is made so by the current sent through the wire from a dynamo, and through the nerve from thebrain. Each may be said to have functions. A subluxation that pinches, or passes upon a nerve, may be likened to a rheostat on, a live wire. The rheostat interferes with 101THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC the current, changes the functions of the wire, also the motor or lamps on that wire. While in the case of a rheostat it is supposedto regulate the current by the resistance, it may interfere with orderange functions of the wire, also the motor and lamp, puttingboth motor and lamp out of service. When a dynamo is burned out (dead) it can no longer create or propel the current through the wires and the wires cease to havefunctions to perform as before, and the rheostat that once keptback, or resisted, changed or deranged the functions of the wire, nolonger interferes with or has any effect on the functions of thewire, as the wire has ceased to have function; therefore, thepresence or absence of the rheostat does not change the system, orany part of it; and in such a case it should be removed and then putback again without affecting the lamps or motor that were onceactive but are then dead (have no functions.) Should there be a corpse that had subluxated vertebrae pressing upon nerves, in that case there would be no functions interferedwith, as there would be no life current to be sent (the generator orgenerating force being absent in the human body), and thepresence or absence of a subluxation would make no change innerve function; without being changed they could not be functionderanged; therefore, there could be no disease nor life expressed. In referring to animal life, disease, death; death does not come until disease is finished. Disease, when it is finished, brings death.Disease is but deranged functions. No function (death) does notcome until deranged functions (disease) is finished. Derangedfunctions, when finished, bring no function (death). Therefore,deranged functions (disease) is the product of subluxations,displacements, and death is the product of deranged functions(disease). No function (death) will not be further commented on in this, but deranged functions can be made normal in the human body byChiropractic (hand fixing). A Chiropractor replaces the displacedvertebrae, increasing the caliber and capacity for transmissionthrough the impinged nerve, so the nerve function can becomenormal. With normal nerve functions we may be said to be inhealth. The brain is the instrument of the mind, which is the generator or generating force of the nervous system. The so-called \"nervesupply\" is in reality but a mental current sent through the nerves by the brain and is the real life current, the life of the body, and itis thus carried to every organ of the body. The generative force, sending the life current, causes the nerves to have work to do\u2014to perform functions. Thus it is that allfunctions of the body are made and controlled by the Intelligentmentalities of man. Any interference with the normal action of the nerves in carrying the life current deranges their functions and thereby 102ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS deranges the functions of organs to which they carry the life current. Deranged functions is disease and is caused by displacedvertebrae impinging the nerves. Deranged functions can only bemade normal by having the displacements replaced, giving freeand normal action to the nerves. Live things alone are sensitive; the nerves are filled with life, which they are carrying to the various organs of the body, and theyalso carry impressions to the brain, where they are interpreted assensations when the intellectual mind, through the medium of thebrain, interpreted them. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 IMMORTALITY. What is life, disease, death, and immortality? These questions have been asked of savants of all ages. They have remained unanswered until the advent of Chiropractic, whichwill, in time, lift the curtain that hangs between this life and theone beyond. This philosophy has given an intelligent explanationof disease, and now I shall attempt, for the first time, to give acomprehensive explanation to the other three questions. What is life? How did it create this human mechanism and continue it as a living entity? From whence does it come, andwhither does it go? What is it ? We are acquainted with the outward manifestations of life, disease and death, but these are only symptoms of something realwhich the human race has desired to know. We have an instinctivelonging to get back of these. We want to know comprehensivelythe cause of each. Last, but not least, we possess an inherent craving, an aspiration to know what there is beyond this life, what of the immortality ofthe soul, spirit. Innate conscious living intelligence, that never hada beginning, nor will it have an ending. I do not pretend to fully comprehend any one of these questions; but Chiropractic has opened the door of intellectualreasoning that will eventually enlighten the world on theseimportant subjects. Man is a dual entity. He is composed of the mortal and immortal\u2014the everlasting\u2014that which always existed and alwayswill. The outward manifestations, the symptoms, so to speak, are patent to all. Its senses, five or more, make the life of the physicalevident. Its functions are made manifest in procuring comfort andsustenance from its maintenance. The Innate Intelligence, known by names, soul, spirit, nature, instinct, subconscious mind, and intuition, has duplicate senses inthe Educated mind. While the latter cares for the outward needs ofthe body, the former looks after the welfare of the interior throughits varied functions. Each has its special work to perform. 103THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC The physical body starts from the fecundated germ, is given life by the male spermatozoa, proceeds to develop the embryo, andthence forms foetus. That which we are pleased to name the Innate (born with) is transmitted by the spiritual mother, and it is not a part of theoutward physical, but of the spiritual; it never sleeps nor tires, isnot subject to material laws or conditions; does not recognize thedarkness, or distance, time nor space. It continues to watch overthe functions of the body as long as they constitute a dual being. As the scion was a part of the original stock, and is not the embodiment of a new plant, shrub or tree until severed, so is Innatea part of the mother, and not another being, until separated fromthe parent. Innate is sexless. Innate has its own consciousness; it is not dependent upon the body for its existence; no more than we are on the house we livein; its immortality, its external existence; does not rely upon thelife of the body it inhabits. It is invincible, cannot be overcome bymaterial changes. It is invulnerable and not subject to wounds orinjuries. Innate is not the educated mind, the thinking quality with which we are familiar. The functions of the brain, upon which the minddepends for outward expressions, are, like other functions, underthe control of the Innate. It is behind thought and expresses itselfby that means. It can set aside, for consideration, the sensations,emotions, passions, desires, or any other mental phenomena, orphysiological functions, and thereby receive educationalimpressions through it. Innate is self-existent, remains unchanged, is not a part of mental or physical manifestation; but instead, controls these, whennot hindered by diseased conditions, caused by displacements ofthe skeletal frame. The brain does not create the mind any morethan the rose does its color and odor. The attributes of the mind are under Innate's control. Its quality and characteristic attainments are not a part of it. It is thedirector of intelligence, is not its slave, but its master. The brain isa medium through which Innate manifests itself. This intelligencepervades the universe. Each being is a branch, as sunbeams radiatefrom the sun. You may call this universal intelligence\u2014God, ifyou choose. During the condition known as trance Innate is not able to express itself through the educated brain. This condition simulatesdeath, in which there is a total suspension of the power ofvoluntary movements, with abolition of all evidence of mentalactivity and the reduction to a minimum of all the vital functions,so that the patient lies still and apparently unconscious ofsurrounding objects, while the pulsation of the heart and thebreathing, although still present, are almost or altogetherimperceptible. In this state or condition the soul, spirit, or Innate had passed out of and away from the body, existing separate and dis- 104ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS tant from its earthly dwelling. Such was the condition of a recent patient. On one occasion she lay for nineteen hours apparentlydead, pronounced so by three physicians. Four hours before theappointed funeral life was observed by moisture on a mirror, whichhad been held on her face. She was returned to her earthlyexistence by Dr. Jim Atkinson, deceased, who, during life, wasthought a crank. While in the trance, the body is practically dead; but the Innate conscious being is active, taking in scenes of this and the otherlife. On several occasions, when this patient returned to physicalconsciousness, she regretted having returned, and would say, \"Oh!why did you bring me back?\" A glimpse of the life beyond createdwithin her a longing to be back with her friends, whom she sawand with whom she conversed. I know from daily experience, of which my five senses are in evidence, that some persons who have lived in this life continue inintelligent existence. My spiritual knowledge has come to bematerial, for it is an expression of consciousness by all of my fivesenses. There are many forms of material, as judged by oursensory faculties. In coma and concussion of the brain, the patient does not recall any experiences during the period of unconsciousness. There is avast difference between trance and coma. In the former, theconscious intelligence is not restricted by substance darkness ordistance, as in pathological coma. In the latter there is no educatedmeans of expression through the functions of the body wherein itis confined. The life, of which we are acquainted, is of the physical, which exists as long as Innate occupies the body. To be able to performthe functions of the body is to live. Disease consists in deranged functions. Functions may become so extremely abnormal that Innate cannot maintain control, making the body untenable. Thisdissolution we call death. Immortality is the life entered as Innateat its birth. The former birth being that of the physical, the latterof the spiritual. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 BACKBONE VARIATIONS. The backbone is also called a spine, or spinal column, because of the projecting spinous processes; spina, meaning thorn. It isalso named the vertebral column, from its being built andcomposed of vertebrae. Vertebra, derived from vertere, to turn, asthese segments are capable of turning upon each other. The spinal column is highly complex. In therapeutical schools it is given but little attention, whereas, it should receive as much asthe rest of the skeletal frame. It is the central axis and thebackbone of the human body, it protects the spinal cord frominjury; to it the ribs are attached, it supports the weight of 105THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC the head and trunk, transmitting their weight to the pelvis. It gives attachment to the ribs. By being flexible, it is endowed withdiverse movements; although composed of many segments, it isfirm and strong. The region over the spine, extending from the occiput to the sacrum, is of special interest to the Chiropractor, for in this localityis found the cause of disease. It is especially necessary that heshould be familiar with not only the external prominences, but alsoknow just what he feels under his hands. Our immense speciallyselected collection of vertebrae aids the student in a knowledge of the abnormal conditions existing out of sight. The surfacemarkings, except the first and third, of the spines, can be easily feltand located by an experienced Chiropractor. In the normal column we find thirty-three vertebrae; thirty- seven, if we count four in the skull, as given by Gray's Anatomy(fourteenth edition), where he says, \"The skull, or superiorexpansion of the vertebral column, has been described as ifcomposed of four vertebrae, the elementary parts of which arespecially modified in form and size, and almost immovablyconnected. These vertebrae are the occipital, parietal, frontal andnasal.\" The segments of this superior expansion, like the inferior, or sacrum, become joined by ossification, in adult life. It is, likethose below, liable to be increased by one or more segments, fromas many ossifying centers, named in this superior expansion,wormian bones. They are occasionally of large size, the oppositesides somewhat regular in shape, and divided from the other bysutures. The superior and inferior expansions of the vertebralcolumn are divided by sutures into two classes, the false vertebrae,those that are composite, made of several bones and fused in theadult; and the true, or movable, which continue so throughout adultlife. The second group is that of the cervical, which seldom varies from the regular number, being made correspondingly thinner orlonger, according to its length. There are two exceptions to thisrule\u2014the three-toed sloth has nine, one of the two-toed kinds hassix, a swan having twenty-five, the sea-cow six. The long necks ofthe giraffe, ostrich, also of the short neck of the whale, have sevencervical vertebrae. I would like to divide this group into sub-groups, the atlas and axis being so peculiarly different from the other five in shape anduse that there is less resemblance between them than the threedifferent orders or true vertebrae. The third group, according to the usual arrangement, is the dorsal, or thoracic. It includes the next twelve in the normalcolumn; this number is occasionally increased or diminished byone, being compensated by a corresponding loss or gain in thelumbar; when such is the case, we have the same number of 106ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS ribs, that of eleven being more rare than thirteen. When decreased, one rib on each side will usually be found to have the sternal endsdichotomous. If increased, the last pair, or floating ribs, will beattached to a duplicate of the last dorsal. I have never known of agreater variation in the number of vertebrae, either way, except inone instance, and that is the unique specimen which The P. S. C. possesses. The first seven dorsal centra coalesced into one, with seven spinous processes, fourteen transverse processes andfourteen ribs. The ribs and processes are encircled half wayaround, similar as the spokes of a wheel converge in one body. The last dorsal and first lumbar have a peculiarity that is distinctly characteristic, the mammillary and accessory processesbeing enlarged to form locks, a compensation for the transverseprocesses, preventing in a great measure the displacement of theirarticular surfaces. The fourth group, of lumbar vertebrae, consists usually of five. This number may be increased or decreased by one. If lacking, itis attached by one or both alea to the sacrum. If increased, it is aduplicate of the fifth, the sacrum having four vertebrae instead ofthe usual five. The only variation from one above, that I know of,is in the unique specimen, where the bodies of the last four lumbarare coalesced into one, having seven intervertebral foramina, fourspinous and eight transverse processes. The sacrum is the inferior expansion of the vertebral column. It articulates with ossa innominata, like the superior. It becomescoalesced in adult life; in infancy it is ordinarily composed of fivedistinct vertebrae. It is similar to the other four groups in that itmay be increased or diminished by the addition of one vertebra. The tail end of the spinal column, or appendage to the sacrum, seems to be a vestigial remnant of our progenitors, a connectionwith the animal kingdom. I fail to see that we, as human beings,with a sitting propensity, have any use for it; in fact, it is quite adisadvantage, being in the way, and subject to frequent injury,causing much trouble without any corresponding benefit. Gouldand Pyle mention, in \"Human Anomalies,\" several cases in whichthe coccyges were elongated into tails, some of which containedtail vertebrae. Every decade notices a decrease in the number ofthese vertebrae. Five being usual; now four is considered normal.The variation consists of three to five vertebrae. It is liable tobecome flexed anteriorly or laterally, and ankylosed to the sacrum. The spinal column is the central axis of the skeleton. It supports the head superiorly, ribs laterally, and through them theweight of the upper extremities. The head rests upon the lateralmasses of the atlas. Then transferred to the superior articularsurfaces of the axis; from there to the body of the third, and 107THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC slightly to the articular processes by way of the strong arch of the axis. From this the weight is transmitted downward, mostlythrough the bodies of the vertebrae, and partly through the articularprocesses to the sacrum, thence to the hip bones and to the lowerlimbs. If all vertebrae are normal in shape, the weight is conveyedin the medial axial line, and the owner walks erect. Theseconditions are not always to be found. Innate occasionally buildsdeformed vertebrae, oftener of the first three cervicals, or lastlumbar; the former causes the head to lean toward the lower orthinner side. The last lumbar is frequently found ankylosed to thesacrum by one or both alae. In such malformations there is moreor less tilting of the hips, a defective gait which corresponds to theabnormally deformed sacrum. Displaced vertebrae whetheraccompanied by fracture or not, cause a deviation from the axialline. The spine is a flexuous and flexible structure, composed of bony segments, between which are interposed elastic fibrouscartilages, called discs. Flexation, extension, and rotation have a normal limit, to a more or less extent, in all parts of the spinal column; these variousmovements are due to these elastic cushions. The intervertebralcartilaginous discs are not always of the same consistency orelasticity, the difference depending upon age and whether theyhave been subjected to excessive heat, better known as fever. A vertebra does not rotate on its central axis. The rotating center is confined to the articulating processes. The normaldeviation of each vertebra is as three of the body to one of theposterior arch and processes. Cartilages of the vertebrae are liable to be fractured or separated from its adjoining bone by wrenches; such cannot beunited as are the bones and other tissue, for they contain no nervesor blood vessels. Such fractures, whether the cartilage itself, orwhere it is united to the centra of the vertebrae, are repaired byInnate Intelligence encysting the break, ankylosing the twovertebrae with osseous material, which, when hardened, is namedexostoses. The nodding or rocking of the head is largely dependent upon the articulations between the occiput and atlas. When we observethe great variation in the shape and size of these rockers, we nolonger wonder why we readily recognize our acquaintances, at adistance, by their distinctly peculiar movements of the head. Theoccipital condyles, or head-rockers, are of various curves ofconvexity and obtuseness, approaching more or less anterior anddeviating accordingly posterior, nearer in front and divergingbehind. To get a comprehensive idea of the unlimited variety ofnatural movements, let us think of rocking chairs with as manyshapes as we find in condyles and their atlas articulations. Someare flat, or nearly so, which would allow but little rockingmovement, no more than a straight curve. Others havesymmetrical 108ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS curves, suggesting that the person in such a rocker could not well resist a continual motion of the head. Occasionally we find thearticular surfaces of condyle rockers divided into two separateparts by an open space, near the center. To comprehend thepeculiar jerky movements this would give the head, let us considerwhat a difference a notch in the center of one or both rockers of achair would make. Some condyles are of a V shape, the apices ofthe atlas articulations are in the center and pointing downward.We can well imagine the awkward rocking motion of such,whether in the human or a rocking chair. Add to the abovedifferences the third occipital condyle that articulates with theodontoid; what differences this would make in the movements ofthe head is difficult to imagine. To my mind, it would be likeadding the fifth wheel to a wagon. We must also take intoconsideration the changes made by fractures in disease, and that notwo atlases are articulated alike, or of the same shape, weight orsize. Some are smooth, others rough; some heavy, while others arelight; some have no spinous process,\u2014in fact, such is the rule,\u2014while there are those which have prominent neurapophyses, or anopen arch instead. The usual horizontal position of the head maybe varied by an obliquity of the atlas, anterior, posterior orlaterally, which, although slight, would make a variation in thecarriage of the head conspicuous. These deviations are largely dueto the difference in the thickness of the lateral masses of the axisand the obliquences of the anterior articular surfaces of theodontoid. A change in the position of the head may be caused by afracture of the neck of the odontoid, which, when healed in anabnormal position or absorbed as a waste portion of the osseoustissue, allows the posterior arch to rest on that of the axis, or theatlas may be crushed into the jugular process on one side, asshown by two specimens in The P. S. C. collection. These different movements of the head and positions in which it is carried are generally thought of as habits, but when we studythem from an anatomical point of view the cause is explained. The rotation of the head is mostly done by the atlas revolving on the axis, the first on the second vertebra. A cursoryexamination of the articulations between the masses of the atlasesand axes of a hundred specimens reveals many shapes and sizes,all of which would produce different movements. Rotation, flexation, extension, and contraction exist in all parts of the spinal column. The extent of these varied movements aresubject to the positions of the joint surfaces, the amount andquality of the articular and intervertebral cartilages. The cervicalvertebrae are allowed greater freedom of motion than the dorsal orlumbar, because of a large spinal foramina, absence of ribsarticulating with transverse processes. Persons differ in their gait and carriage while moving or standing. This is largely due to the different formations, size and 109THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC shape of the sacrum. A study of a large number of sacra in The P. S. C. collection will corroborate this. Rotation of any portion of the spinal column is produced by each vertebra turning slightlyupon the one below. This produces a lateral deviation of thespinous processes and a divergence of the transverse in proportionto the amount of rotation. This turning from the axial line ispermitted to a certain degree without injury. More than normalcauses an M. D.'s sprain, a Chiropractic subluxation. A displacedvertebra, a Chiropractic subluxation, a separation of one or botharticulating processes, produces three times the displacement ofthe anterior of the bodies, as is the apparent difference in thespinous processes. This is true in a rotary, lordosis, or a kyphoticcurve. The Chiropractor should be skilled in these, which can onlybe acquired by education and practice. The inquirer for acorrespondence course will, see how futile such would be. If the spinal column is not prepared for an unexpected strain, it is more easily wrenched than when the muscles are made taut byexpectancy. If the violence is extreme, something must give way,either one or both of the intervertebral or articular cartilageswrenched from their osseous connections. Such injury is, to allintents and purposes, a cartilaginous fracture and, like those of thecostal, is repaired by deposition of bony material in the form offerrules, bands, or straps for the same purpose, and in a likemanner, as a blacksmith would mend a broken wagon tongue. Thissymphysis produces ankylosis between two or more vertebrae, sothat the joints are lost. Vertebrae wrenched from their normalposition may be replaced intuitively by the traction of muscles, orscientifically by the hands of a Chiropractor. If the subluxation besuch as to form a kyphosis, or a lateral rotation, the intervertebralforamina will not be occluded, the nerves passing through themwill not be pinched. If the subluxations assume a lordosis orscoliosis, the size of the intervertebral foramina will be decreased,causing the pressure upon the nerves found therein, and producingpathological conditions at the peripheral ends of the affected nervefibers. If an excess amount of heat is produced by the impingedcalorific nerves, the result is a softening of those bones in whichthey end and the cartilage adjoining. If a great degree of heat iscontinued for a length of time, the cartilage is destroyed and thebones become carious and necrosed. This undue amount of heat is conducted to the bodies by the discs of intervertebral buffers. It not only produces softening andcaries of the vertebra but absorption of the intervertebral andarticular cartilage. These diseased conditions change the shape ofthe vertebrae and consequently the individual's movements,thereby establishing a peculiar gait by which we readily recognizethe owner. Occasionally the anterior root of the transverse process of the seventh cervical exists as a separate bone. It is then known 110ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS as a cervical, or homologous rib, specimens of which may be also seen in The P. S. C. osteological collection. The bony landmarks of the vertebral column are very important to a Chiropractor. It is surprising to a medical man, or to a newstudent, to see how readily an old Chiropractor determines theposition of each vertebra. In this \"practice makes perfect.\" The spinal column, in fleshy persons, is less conspicuous to external observation than those who are thin. There are but few inwhich an experienced Chiropractor cannot locate each and everyvertebra. The relative position of the atlas can be located by thespace between the spinous process of the axis and that of theoccipital. If the space above or below is less normal, wereasonably conclude that the nerves are pinched in the grooves. Inmany persons one or both of these are converted into foramina byan osseous bridge, thereby protecting the veins, arteries and nerveswhich pass through them. The third cervical has a spinous process that varies from a tubercle to that of one as long as its neighbor above. The spinous processes of the 4th, 6th and 7th, in the order named, commonly increase in length, the last being so prominentthat it has received the special designation of the VertebraProminens. Sometimes the sixth has a process equal to that of theseventh. The dorsal spines are very oblique; it should be remembered that their tips do not correspond on a level with their bodies. Also,that the six central spinous processes are liable to be bent to theleft or right. This must be taken into consideration when making atopographical survey. The epiphyses of the spinous processes do not unite until near adult age. Before they become apophysed they are liable to bedisplaced, torn loose from the diaphyses and absorbed, as are otheruseless pieces of bone, leaving the spinous process shorter than itsfellows. This difference, which is readily apparent to theChiropractor, might mislead a beginner and cause him to think thatthe vertebra was displaced anterior; but he learns better when hefinds the transverse processes are all in line. The Chiropractor is especially concerned in the intervertebral foramina, which are formed by the pedicles being notched aboveand below, so that when in apposition they make a smooth openingfor the transmission of arteries, veins and nerves. The occlusion ofthese foramina would restrict the flow of blood to and from theheart, were it not for anastomosis, intercommunication, the arteriesof the spinal cord anastomosing freely with each other, but whenimpinged nerves are deranged in their functions, mental impulsesthat incite action cannot be transmitted over another line. The construction of the various segments of the vertebral column insures the safety of the spinal cord from ordinaryviolence; the vertebral bodies, arches and discs are well adapted to 111THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC resist the effects of compression, the intervertebral cartilage acting as buffers in resisting shocks and permitting the elasticity wherethe greatest movements are required; the spinal canal is enlargedaccordingly, so as to allow greater flexion without compression. The adult skeleton is composed of 200 bones. This does not include the six small ones of the ears, the thirty-two teeth, nor thewormian bones of the skull. The vertebral column has twenty-six,the skull twenty-two, upper extremities the hyoid bone, sternum and ribs maketwenty-six. The bones of young persons are comparatively smooth; they become darker in color and rougher as they advance in age. Thoseof the male are coarser and larger than those of the female. Boneswhich have been subjected to excessive heat, generally known asfever, are yellow. The bones of the body vary greatly in their texture, depending largely upon the different degrees of heat that they have beensubjected to. Any or all of the bones of the body are softened byexcessive heat, and hardened by a lack of it. Bones that are madepreternaturally soft or hard depend upon what functions areaffected. Those of the central dorsal nerves, when impinged, havean effect over the whole of the body, producing osteomalacia. If,the patient survives the heat period, then diseased conditions go tothe other extreme, the temperature goes below 98 degrees, andeburnation or hardening of bones follow. Spontaneous fractures are those in which the bones have become fragile, very soft, flexible, waxy and friable. This state isproduced by oseitis. Conditions produced by an undue amount ofheat are known by the names of osteomalacia, mollities ossium, thesoftening depending upon the loss of earthly matter which hasbeen removed by too much caloric. These are usuallyaccompanied by caries, necrosis, burrowing abscesses, bonetumors and osteosarcoma. The bones may be fragile or so soft that they can be easily cut with a knife. Osteomalacia differs in degree as do other diseasedconditions. This variation may be due to the difference in degreeof functions and the manner of injury. Medical men have mademuch inquiry by investigating the effects. Chiropractors search forthe cause. Mollities ossium is a disease of bones in which they become flexible and lose their natural firmness. This is well illustrated bya case given in Cooper's Practical Surgery, page 310: \"She had a fall which occasioned her to keep in her bed for some time, andfelt great pain and weakness in her loins and lower extremities. Inabout a year and a half she began to perceive that her left leg wasparticularly affected. Along with her weakness she had violentpains over her whole body, which increased after a miscarriage,and still more after a natural delivery. She was then seized withstarlings, great inquietude, and such violent heats that 112ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS she was almost continually in a sweat and could not bear the least covering even in the coldest weather, and while her painscontinually increased, she took notice that her urine precipitated awhite sediment. Her pains abated upon the appearance of thesediment, but she now observed that her limbs began to bend, andfrom this time the softening of them gradually increased till herdeath. \"The trunk of her body did not exceed twenty-three inches in length; the thorax exceedingly ill-formed, and the bones of theupper part very much distorted; those of the lower part were verymuch bent, and the thigh bones became so pliable that her feetmight easily be laid on each side of her head. She had violentpains, starlings, difficulty of breathing, spitting of blood, andlastly, a fever, with convulsions. Dissection showed the boneswere entirely dissolved, the periosteum remaining unhurt, so thatthey exhibited only the form of a cylinder.\" On page 811 of Cooper's Practical Surgery a case is related, the special points of which are: The bones were fragile before theybecame soft. These conditions began with \"pain through thewhole body, attended with feverish symptoms.\" She broke her legwhile walking from the bed to the chair, the bones were heard tosnap, there was no callus formed. Then the bones began to growflexible. Toward the end of her life her breathing became difficult,the spine distorted, every movement of the vertebrae gave pain inthe lumbar region. The tuberosities were so soft that they \"spreadmuch,\" on account of that she was obliged to sit upright in bed.The ends of her fingers and thumbs became very broad by frequentendeavors to raise herself. At her death it was found bymeasurement that she had lost two feet two inches in length. Allbones, except the teeth, were so soft than they could be cut withthe knife. The bones contained a quantity of oily matter and butlittle earthy. There is one characteristic feature to which I desire to call the attention of the reader which enters as a prominent factor in thevariation of the vertebral column, from youth to senility, i. e., the effects of age on joints, for, bear in mind, that they are not alike inany two periods of life. In the normal backbone there is a continual change in the texture, shape and size of the vertebrae and in the interveningcartilages. They do not arrive at maturity until adult age; evenafter this they continue to undergo continual modifications. From infancy to old age there is a vast difference in their structure, due to occupation, diet, natural changes, as age advancesand diseased conditions imposed upon it by mishaps whichderange their relative position to each other. Not taking into consideration the many and varied changes by accidents, which wrench the vertebral column, causingChiropractic subluxations, there are great differences existing atvarious periods of life. In the infant the edges and surfaces of the intervertebral cartilages are round and smooth. One of the most important fea- 113THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC tures to a Chiropractor is that this portion is supplied with blood vessels. Diseases of the joints and bones are caused by the lack ofInnate current subsequent to their displacements instead of beinginherited. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 JOINTS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. The spinal column is composed of thirty-seven irregular bones, named vertebrae. The twenty-four of the cervical, dorsal andlumbar are separated through life by discs of fibro-cartilage.These are named true, or movable, vertebrae, in contradistinctionto the four of the skull\u2014the superior expansion\u2014and nine ofsacrum and coccyx. These fourteen are called false, or fixed,vertebrae, because of their becoming consolidated. These bonysegments are variously modified in different portions to servespecial purposes. It is the object of this article to notice thearticulations of this flexuous and flexible column. The five bones of the upper part, the nasal, frontal, two parietal, and the occipital, correspond in their expansion to those of thesacrum. In the adult they are immovably connected at theirborders by sutures, which are really closely fitted seams orarticulations. These joints are filled by a fibrous membrane. Insome places it amounts to a thin layer of cartilage. The bones ofthese synarthrodial articulations have borders that are dentated(like teeth), serrated (notched like a saw), limbous (overlapping),or false sutures, where there is a simple apposition of twocontinuous rough surfaces. Some cranial sutures combine two ormore of these varieties. In advanced life the bones are fused,because of the membranous symphysis of the sutures becomingossified. Nowhere in the skeletal frame do we find as great a variation in construction as in the edges of these five cranial bones. Thisdeviation is greatly increased by interposed ossa wormiana, whichcorrespond to the sesamoid bones in other parts of the body. Theyvary in size from that of a pin head to one and a half inches inbreadth and three in length. They assist in filling the gaps and themobility of the cranial bones. The diversity in shape is so variedthat it is impossible to find one that will fit in the place of another.The student should be provided with at least two skulls, onedisarticulated, the other vertically bisected. The sacrum forms the lower expansion of the vertebral column and consists of five pieces. During early life these are separatedby temporary hyaline cartilage between the articular processes,bodies and lateral masses. About the eighteenth year the twolower segments finite by the intervening cartilage becomingossified. This process gradually extends upward until all parts arejoined. Between the twenty-fifth and thirtieth year they form onesolid piece. A similar process attends the four bones of thecoccyx. Often the first segment is united with the sacrum, giving 114ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS it the appearance of six vertebrae. Previous to coalescense they are liable to be subluxated, the same as true vertebrae. Theauricular borders of the sacrum and ossa innominata are articulatedby a synchondrosis joint, the intermediate body being hyalinecartilage, which covers the auricular surfaces of sacrum and ilia. Between the axis and sacrum there are twenty-three amphiarthrodial joints which unite in an intimate manner thecorresponding surfaces of the bodies by cartilage. This is firmlyattached to the tipper and lower surfaces of the centra. The fourcurves of the spine are largely due to the wedge-shape of thecartilaginous discs. They are the thinnest between the second andthird cervical, from which they gradually thicken as they proceeddownward. It composes one-fourth of the length of the movablepart of the column. Near the center of each is a pulpy nucleousresembling a synovial sack. These intervertebral cartilages compressible. They serve as buffers in resistingshocks and contribute very much to the elasticity of the spine. There are fifty arthrodial, or gliding, joints between the articular processes of the true vertebrae from the occiput to thesacrum. These are formed by continuous plain surfaces, oneslightly concave, the other equally convex. Their facets arecovered with articular cartilage, which does not ossify except whenexposed to excessive heat. The first two of these joints are usually, large and oval. They approach each other in front and diverge behind. Their individualshape is greatly diversified, no two pairs being just alike; in fact,the two of the same person are often quite dissimilar, as shown bya hundred specimens in The P. S. C. osteological collection. The two condyles of the occiput correspond in figure to their mates, except that those of the atlas are concave, those of the skullconvex. The surfaces of these and the next two pair, between atlasand axis, face each other nearly horizontally. While those betweenocciput and atlas are kidney-shaped, the atlas and axis are circular. As we descend, we find the surfaces of the next thirty-four articulations face each other obliquely, the last twelve nearlyvertically. The transition is usually between the dorsal and firstlumbar. This may occur at one above or below, while their mateson the opposite side face vertically. Between the atlas and axis are two trochoid articulations, pivot joints, one on the anterior and the other on the posterior of theodontoid process. The ventral facets are oval and face each othervertically. The posterior is formed by a thick, dense, strongtransverse ligament, clad in front by cartilage which articulateswith the odontoid bone, or \"processus dentatus.\" Movements. The various movements of the many joints of the vertebral column are modified by the shape of the articulating surfaces, the 115THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC thickness of the intervening cartilage and the connecting ligaments. The skull is formed by a series of modified vertebrae which compose the neural arches. They are greatly expanded to enclosethe brain, similarly as the true vertebra surrounds its extension orthe spinal cord. The cranial nerves pass through the magnumforamen. How much may be learned by Chiropractors of nervepressure in the superior and inferior expansions of the spinalcolumn is yet to be determined. The science is not yet fullydeveloped; there remains much to learn. At this date we have justworked out a knowledge of cord impingement in the sacrum andcoccyx. The cranium may be deformed by synostosis, the sutures of which are often affected by arthritis. Irregularity, want ofsymmetry, may be caused not only by the premature closing of oneor more sutures, but a portion, usually one-half, not being suppliedwith the normal amount of nutriment, remains in a micromegaliccondition. Remember, all functions, including that of nutrition, areunder the control of appropriate mental impulses. Inhydrocephalus, where the head is abnormally large, the bones areforced apart by a surplus of water, their borders continue to growtoward each other, the intervening gaps partly filled. The permitted movements between head and atlas are those of nodding, or rocking, forward or backward, with slight lateralmotion. This ginglymoid articulation is a hinge joint, composed oftwo condyles or knuckles, which rock in two elliptical cavities ofthe atlas. These elongated articular heads are semilunar from frontto back and convex from side to side. The articular surfaces of this joint vary much in shape, as shown by fifty skulls and two hundred atlases in our possession.Some are very concave and convex; others are flat or nearly so;many have a bifurcated V shape. Often the two are not similar inshape or size. Occasionally we find three occipital condyles. Thetwo normal being placed farther apart anteriorly, so as to makeroom for the third. The extra condyle is a tubercle situated on the basilar process between the anterior ends of the normals and articulates with theapex of the odontoid process. Observers will notice that thesummit of the odontoid approaches very close to the basilarprocess, even where there is no articulation. With this innumerable variation in the shape of rockers, is it any wonder that we are able to recognize our acquaintances bytheir peculiar head movements? These occipital rockers may belikened to those of a chair, which, if curves are uniform, not tooconvex, or flat, the two properly approaching each other, only thatthe proximate ends are vice versa, then movements will be easy toperform and esthetic. But if one or both form an angle at thecenter, or base, with a groove at vortex, we would not admire theuse of such a rocker. Many of the atlas articulations 116ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS are built thus. Let it be remembered that no two of us are any more alike in our osseous, vascular, or nervous makeup internallythan we are externally. Between the atlas and axis are four joints of two kinds: that of the arthrodial, between the masses where the surfaces glide oneach other, similar to the fifth wheel of a wagon, and the twotrochodial on the anterior and posterior of the odontoid process.Here the movement is limited to rotating the atlas and the head in asemicircle. An examination of these joints presents many shapesand sizes of the two facets on the odontoid and its articulatingfacet on the interior of the ventral archo of the atlas. Thesevariations cannot help but make their corresponding diversifiedrotary movements. There are fifty-four articulations between axis and first lumbar. Eighteen are amphiarthrodial. They form the symphysis betweenthe bodies and permit slight movement. Thirty-six are arthrodial,of the articular processes, and allow motion forward, backwardand lateral. Very slight rotation is possible between the last two dorsal, owing to the mammillary processes being enlarged, forming a lock,which, in a measure, compensates for the lack of leverage supportoffered by the transverse processes found above and below, buthere lacking. This portion of the spinal column is more liable to injury by wrenches, which cause subluxations, than any other. A carefulexamination of the skeletons in the Army and Navy MedicalMuseum at Washington, D. C., demonstrated to the writer that alarge percentage had suffered by a displacement in this region. Between the first lumbar and sacrum there are fifteen articulations. The intervertebral discs, fibro-cartilage, between thebodies are the same in structure as those above. They are larger inevery direction, therefore, allow more mobility. The superiorarticular surfaces face inward, backward and upward, while thoseabove, backward, upward and outward. The articular surfaces ofthe lumbar are convex and concave. Their position does not allowbut a slight lateral movement, but are adapted for forward andbackward motion. The individual movements are often modified by ill-shaped vertebrae, the bodies of which have been lessened or increased inone direction with a corresponding loss or gain in another.Remember, that one portion of a vertebra cannot be changed inshape without a corresponding alteration in all parts. All deformedvertebrae are made so by excessive heat, which softens, so thatmuscular contraction compresses them into an abnormal shape,making the various curvatures. The heat may be so intense as to cause decay and death. The dead portion may be removed in fine particles with pus, or drycaries, known as rarefying osteitis, arthritis, without suppuration.The pus is decomposed serum. Caries does not depend 117THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC upon purulence. If the patient's death ensues during this period, known to the M. D.'s as fever, the vertebrae, whether deformed inshape or carious, will be found light, friable and soft. If the patientsurvives the period of excessive heat then the temperature will fallbelow normal; the parts which were overheated will becomepreternaturally hard, eburnated. The remaining portion of theaffected vertebrae may coalesce. If so, the uniting is done whilethe parts are heated and softened, making a sharp kyphosis. Any vertebra is liable to become subluxated, its articular surfaces displaced, the cartilage torn loose from one of the bodies.Innate Intelligence mends this break by osseous symphysis and tiesthe two to prevent further separation. The vertebra may be ankylosed by osseous material oozing out of one or both of the bodies, fusing the two together. The odontoidprocess may be separated from the ventral arch of the atlas; if so,Innate fills the gap with callus. It is the duty of the Chiropractor toadjust the displaced vertebrae; this done, Innate has no further usefor the osseous callosity, therefore, removes it. Life and healthmay be prolonged by insuring the mobility of joints, moreespecially those of the backbone, from which all nerves, whichtransmit mental impulses of innervation emerge. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 IDIOSYNCRACIES OF THE BACKBONE. The spine is a flexuous and flexible column, composed of thirty-seven vertebrae, viz.: The skull, consisting of the nasal,frontal, two parietals and occipital. This superior expansion offive bones, like the inferior of the sacrum, become ankylosed inadult life. The cervical vertebrae are seven in number. This holds good in all animals, with but few exceptions. The elongation of the giraffeover that of the whale is made by the difference in the length of thevertebrae. In man this number seldom varies The P. S. C. has, no doubt, the largest collection of anomalous vertebrae in America, inwhich there is no exception to this rule, unless it be that of asecond cervical, consisting of axis and third. While occupying theplace of the two vertebrae, it is only the size of one. There are twelve dorsal. The number is sometimes increased or decreased by one, which is usually compensated by the last lumbarbeing attached to, or a lack of one in the sacrum. We have onlyone exception. This is found in the unique monstrosity which hasonly six thoracic vertebrae, the first seven being coalesced in onebody. A deviation of one more or less is accompanied by acorresponding number of ribs, eleven or thirteen pairs. There are five lumbar. This number, like that of the thoracic, may be increased or decreased by one, the surplus or de- 118ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS ficiency being found in the dorsal or sacrum. The unique monstrosity is the only exception. It has only two lumbar; the lastfour are united in one centrum. The sacrum is the lower expansion of five vertebrae which, like the superior of the skull, becomes united in adult life and formsone solid bone. The usual number is sometimes increased, andrarely decreased, by one. The extra addition may be accounted forby a lumbar or coccyx being fused by ankylosis. The coccyx ordinarily consists of four vertebrae. It is, according to the Darwinian theory, a vestigial remnant of a tail. Sofar as known, civilized humanity has no use for it. The tuberositiesof the ossa innominata are better adapted for the weight of thebody in a sitting posture than the apex of the coccyx. Backbones have a similarity, yet there are no two of them alike in color, shape or size. There are no two spines which have anyvertebrae that can be exchanged without being observed by ananatomist. There is a vast difference in the shape of corresponding vertebrae, more especially in the atlas, seventh cervical, last dorsaland fifth lumbar. Some of these are better adapted than others intheir construction to withstand accidents which may displace thefifty-two articular joints. Besides Innate variations we findvertebrae that have taken permanent positions, caused by beingforced beyond the normal limit. These displacements makelordosis, scoliosis and kyphosis, and such diseases as caries andspondylitis deformans, in which the bodies have been softened byexcessive heat, partly absorbed, preternaturally soft or hard,ankylosis of bodies and processes. We are no more alike internally than externally. It is no wonder that we readily recognize our acquaintances by their gait ortheir movements of the head. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 SUBLUXATIONS OF VERTEBRAE ARE THE PHYSICAL REPRESENTATIVE OF DISEASE. It is a well-known fact that nerves proceed from the spinal cord in bundles, or leashes, through openings along the sides of thevertebrae, and are distributed to the various parts of the body.These nerves contain efferent and afferent fibres. All sensation,pain and pleasure being due to the existence of the latter, allaction, whether Innate or Educated voluntary, to the former'simpulses. Nerves emanating therefrom are liable to serious interference by displacements of vertebrae, caused by runaways, railwayaccidents, blows or unexpected missteps. These, thoughapparently trivial at first, may occasion very grave and mostpersistent symptoms. 119THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Besides the products, viz.: sensation and motion, a subdivision of the latter has a set of transmitting fibers which conveycaloricity, whose sole function is to express the proper amount ofimpulse, acting as an igniter for chemical combustion for theheating of the body. A pressure upon these fibers producesdisturbance in their function, causing them to convey too littleimpulse, a recognized symptom in a certain class of disease, or toogreat a quantity, producing a condition termed fever. In a study of the individual parts of which the spinal column is composed, we are forcibly impressed with the peculiar formationof the intervertebral foramina through which the spinal nervespass, all of which are formed by the articular union of the twonotches of adjoining vertebrae, the one above and the other below.This being the case, any accident or strain which will cause adisplacement or subluxation of a vertebra necessarily changes itsrelative position of these notches. The arteries, veins and nervesthat pass through this foramen fill it so accurately that anyvariation in its form or size, except when enlarged by a truekyphosis, will interfere with their transmission of impulses. The first two pairs of nerves emerge from the spine in grooves above and below the atlas. These are as liable to be impinged andare as readily freed from pressure by Chiropractors as are thefollowing twenty-three. The six pairs of sacral and coccygealnerves are liable to be injured in adult life by fracture. Thedisplaced fragments of bone partially occluding the foraminacannot help but impinge nerves. If allowed to heal in this position,a life-long pressure continues with the distress occasioned thereby.Before ossification, the cartilaginous parts of the sacrum are toosoft to cause a continued constraining force. All movements and sensations of the whole body, indeed, all there is of life, are due to the existence of mental impulses, theircorresponding or cycling impressions, the interpretation thereofand consequent adaptation. When transmission of impulses isnormal the various functions are normal and a complete system ofharmony exists. But if, for any cause, undue pressure is brought tobear upon nerves, pain and disease is the result. All functions ofthe body depend upon and act according to the condition of nervesso that the adaptation of all parts to each other is essential for theirperfect freedom, All movements are made by the contraction of muscles. There is no power in a muscle to move itself without mental force. Muscles, when excited to action, draw bones to which they are attached closer together; when irritated they draw with too muchforce so that certain forms of wryneck, hip-joint disease, and spinalcurvature are the result. Instances are common where increasedand continued action of the muscles about a joint have caused it tobe drawn out of its proper position. Such displacements neveroccur except through the influence of a hindered mental impulse,making abnormal contractions. 120ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS The circulation, absorption, assimilation, elimination, repair and heat production are controlled by sets of specific mentalimpulses. Sciatica, female diseases, hip-joint disease, constipation and piles are the result of subluxations in the lumbar vertebrae.Diseases of the heart, liver and stomach are produced bysubluxated thoracic vertebrae which impinge nerves proceeding tothose organs. Many ailments of the head and face have their originin the displacements of the cervical vertebrae. Whether we have a headache, too much heat (fever), constipation, dysentery or any other disease, the cause producing itmust be adjusted. Subluxations of spinal vertebrae are caused by innumerable and various accidents, as heavy lifting, falls, wrenches, train wrecks,etc. Complete dislocation of the vertebral column accompanied with fracture, those in which the articular surfaces have lost whollytheir natural connection, have long been recognized by the medicalworld. While it is true that vertebrae of the spinal column are so interlocked by their articulating processes that complete luxationswithout fracture seldom occur, subluxations, slight displacementswhere the two articulating surfaces have lost only part of theirnatural connection, are much more common, in fact, are of dailyoccurrence. These are not the complete dislocations known by themedical profession, yet a knowledge of them has done more toexplain the time-worn question, \"What is the cause of disease?\"than all doctrines advanced by medical schools from the time ofHippocrates to the present day. These incomplete dislocations are called Chiropractic subluxations, for it was The P. S. C. that first recognized and brought to public notice their existence and importance in thecausation of disease and worked out a system, method, art andphilosophy of correcting them. Some contortionists are able, at will, to disarticulate and replace many joints of the body, notably those of the hips,shoulders and cervical vertebrae. This is done by knowing how,and long practice. This being true why should it be considered impossible for vertebrae to be partly or even wholly luxated by accident, and thenreplaced by those who made such work a specialty For some time it has been known that injuries to the spine were prone to cause diseases. Many explanations of their origin havebeen given by eminent writers. At times their discussions have ledthem so close to the true nature of the injury to the spinal columnand the manner in which the effect was produced that the onlywonder is that some one had not long ago discovered that thesetroubles were caused by subluxations of articular 121THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC processes occluding the foramina, which diminished the current. Some writers have advanced far enough to describe a slightvariation in the position of certain spinous processes andtenderness in the nerves at the sides of them, but in the nextparagraph would utterly lose the gleam of truth and say nothingwhatever could be wrong with the osseous structure; that asubluxation without a fracture was almost impossible; if such didoccur, the result would be instant death, and if a patient with theabove condition could survive, it would be very dangerous to lifeto attempt to replace the displaced vertebrae. Vertebrae are supplied with nerves which, like all others, originate in the brain and pass through and out of the spine by way of intervertebral foramina and are, therefore, liable to be injured inthe same way and produce diseases similar to those found in thesofter parts. Subluxations and compression cause arthritical conditions, softening and absorbing the earthly substance of the spinal cord,the nerves emanating therefrom, and a part of all of the vertebralcolumn. Intense heat in the latter or in bones expands, softens andcauses more or less of the substance which oozes out to bedeposited on the surfaces of the bones called exostoses which,when coalesced, ankyloses vertebrae and other joints. Caries produced by excessive heat, wedge-shaped cartilages and vertebrae compressed by muscular compression while they aresoftened by excessive heat during the M. D.'s fever, produce thevarious curvatures of the spine. Returning the intervertebralforamina to their former size and shape relieves pressure andrestores the mind to its former personification. Results aremanifested by restoration to normal conditions. In other words,the action of normal mental impulses are to restore the disfiguredvertebral column to its natural shape. Ten years ago the statement that \"a displacement of two bones whose articular surfaces have lost wholly, or in part, their naturalconnection, is the cause of a large share of our diseases,\" wouldhave been ridiculed, but now when the scientific man reads\"Luxations of Vertebrae Cause Disease,\" if he does not accept theidea, he at least thinks that there may be something in it. All statements not axiomatic must be proven. Unquestionably the most convincing demonstration of \"Subluxations of VertebraeCause Disease\" is furnished by being able to adjust the subluxatedvertebrae. The cause of disease being removed, the patientrecovers from his infirmities. In an acute case where there has notbeen a structural change of the vertebrae, the results may beinstantaneous because pressure being removed by replacing thevertebrae normal conditions and functions are restored. In cases oflong standing where the vertebrae have been changed in form bylong continued undue pressure, it necessarily taker time to reformdisfigured vertebrae, but this will inevitably follow when freedomof mental impulses prevail. Therefore re- 122ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS placing the subluxated parts, restoring freedom to nerves that they may convey natural action to the portions of the body that havebeen made abnormal by their restricted conditions is, to aChiropractor, the only reasonable thing to do. With knowledge of this truth established by years of experience, The P. S. C. has continued to make a special study of the vertebral column, discovering much that was previouslyunknown and developing a knowledge of how to replacedisplacements found therein. Among other discoveries they havefound that impinged fibers, transmitting calorific mental impulsesto nerves passing jointly through the same foramen, is what makesother nerves whose functions are also involved following the samesubluxation, swollen or inflamed at its exit or any other distancetoward the periphery, thus making it easily traced and itssymptoms all along its path or at its peripheral equivalent, hencedisease of that character. Many times these sheaths of tendernerves can be traced from their exit at the spine to their terminalends by a sensitive condition following palpation. One hundred per cent of diseases are due to pressure upon nerves as they pass through the foramina along the sides of thevertebral column. This pressure interferes with their functions,hence inflammation, unnatural action, pain and distress aremanifested where these nerves end. All diseases are prolongeduntil pressure of those nerves leading to the affected parts areremoved. It is the business of the Chiropractor to remove this pressure with the hand, the doing of which has never been taught in medicalschools, nor practiced by them. On the contrary, they state thatsuch displacements do not occur, and if subluxations couldhappen, that it would be impossible for a man to replace them withhis hands. All pain is due to mental interpretation of abnormal external circumstances. All morbid action in the body is due to excess or alack of expression or mental impulses in the motor nerve endings.An examination of the spinal column shows that each vertebra isprovided with spinous and transverse processes. These are used bythe Chiropractor first as one of the means of analysis, andsecondly, as levers in restoring vertebrae to their normal position. Chiropractors can relieve the larger percentage of human ailments by scientifically adjusting displacements. Even withcases abandoned by practitioners of other systems of healingfavorable results follow as surely as effect follows cause. Our philosophy of removing pressure has the most rational claim upon the affected, and when understood by the practitioner,he will no longer need to cover up ignorance of the cause ofdiseases by using meaningless explanations that do not explain.We cordially invite the most rigid investigation of our work, and ofthe principles of the Chiropractic method of adjusting the cause ofdisease. This science, when properly applied, will 123THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC mitigate suffering, and will adjust the cause of ailments that cannot be reached in any other way. Chiropractors are able to place theirfingers on the spine and say, pointing, specifically, \"There is thecause of this or that complaint.\" If the reader comprehends the basic principles of Chiropractic, \"take off the pressure,\" there will be little difficulty inunderstanding how utterly useless and unscientific it is to attemptto remove the cause of disease by treating effects. This knowledge opens up a new field for investigation and research. All schools have been experimenting in the vain hope offinding a specific. Chiropractors are locating the cause within thephysical sufferer instead of by unity of the one with the other.When the cause is located and adjusted, Educated and InnateIntelligence can perform their appropriate actions and establishhealth by a free use of the various nerves adapted to their differentfunctions. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 CHIROPRACTORS, DO NOT DIAGNOSE DISEASE. Diagnosis. (Med.) \"The art or act of recognizing the presence of disease from its signs or symptoms and deciding as to itscharacter.\"\u2014 Webster. \"That part of medicine whose object is the recognition or determination of the nature of diseases and the knowledge of thepathognomonic signs.\"\u2014 Dunglison. Chiropractic studies causes. It is the art of adjusting them. A Chiropractor pays but little attention to symptoms, consideringthem only as guides showing the location of the causes. He neednot waste hours, days or weeks waiting for symptoms to develop,so he may be able to recognize them in order to name intelligentlythe combination in its expressions and give medicines according toits name. There are no two persons who have the same set ofnerves, with an equal degree of pressure, thus producing no twocombinations of symptoms exactly alike. How much better it is toconsider this combination of abnormal functions and put it throughanalysis. The term in this capacity is new, but it is the appropriateword to use when holding a Chiropractic consultation or adjustingcauses. Note the appositeness of these definitions: Analysis. \"The tracing of things to their source and the resolving of knowledge into its original principles.\"\u2014 Webster. Analyze. \"To separate into constituent parts.\"\u2014Webster. Analysis. \"Resolution of anything into its component parts.\"\u2014 Dunglison. A Chiropractor will observe closely effects or symptoms, and will then resolve them \"into original principles\" that are beingexpressed abnormally. Each symptom, by analysis, must be traced\"to its source.\" It is this cause that is then given careful 124ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS study, subsequent examination and adjustment \"resolving it\" into its original \"normal principles.\" Adjustment, not long ago, was a new term, yet today it is the correct word to use. From now on let us use the term analyze\"instead of \"diagnose,\" in connection with disease. An M. D., a D. O., or a disciple of any other therapeutical school (as all are of the same class, since they treat effects), studiessymptoms, and from these diagnoses the character of the disease isdetermined, his treatment or prescription being given accordingly.It does not occur to him to analyze these effects by tracing them totheir source. To diagnose is to be able to decipher present symptoms, to separate, to give them relative values, and then use closerdiscrimination so as to name the diseases. Prognosis is to tell the future outcome of this disease; what it may run into or terminate in. Whether grave or ultimately leavingthe patient living. Vitality, age, occupation, environments are allconsidered just so far as these externals bear upon each or thecombined condition of the disease. It is well known that the air ofcertain localities is bad for some diseases, some types of water arewearing upon certain systems, high altitudes making certain lungdifficulties easier for one disease or harder upon another tobreathe, moist or dry are better or worse for certain individuals.Morphine is a killer of pain; other drugs have equally as good orbad effects upon the disease, all of which the physician treatingdiseases must test, try time and again, watch the effect of each inorder to see how much vitality is used in resistance and taken inconsideration before giving the prognosis of the disease. Hedwells upon the outcome of these symptoms. The Chiropractorsanalyze these effects to a cause. Prognosis. (Med.) \"The acts or art of foretelling the course and termination of a disease; also the outlook afforded by this act ofjudgment.\"\u2014 Webster. Prognosis. \"Judgment formed by the physician regarding the future progress and termination of any disease.\"\u2014 Dunglison . The practitioner that treats effects must be an expert diagnostician and prognostician; he must be proficient in\"foretelling the course and termination of a disease.\" This is hisbusiness. He cannot give medicines nor treat with any methodwhatsoever, including Osteopathy, until these conditions areknown. Effects must have cause. As soon as this is correcteddiseases cannot exist. How can symptoms Manifest themselves ifthe cause is corrected? Chiropractic is that science of adjustingcause. Does a Chiropractor diagnose or prognose disease? Is henot an analyst ? By adopting the word Analyze, Chiropractic has added to its specific nomenclature a new, distinctive and valuable term. When a patient enters, tell him, \"Yes, sir, I can give a complete analysis of your disease, from cause to effect, or from effect 125THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC to cause.\" Chiropractors are the only ones possessing sufficient accurate knowledge to do this. The prognostician must guess the outcome to the best of his knowledge. A Chiropractor knows. One studies effects and thepossible outcome of this treatment of them, the other knows thepositive results before the adjustments begin. The comparisonbriefly is Diagnosis and Prognosis, scientific guesswork, the otherChiropractic Analysis\u2014back to cause\u2014is scientific knowledge. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 DISEASE GERMS. If it is an established fact with the learned profession, that certain diseases are caused by these infinitesimal animalculae, whydo they hesitate to inform the dear people, who are in constantfear, where these germs originate? If it be a fact, and no more theory, anxious, suffering humanity desires to become acquainted with the subject and to learn how toavoid contagion. Are they contained in the air we breathe? If so, why are not all afflicted alike? Do they come from the gentle zephyrs wafted onus from the northwest at the rate of forty miles an hour, when themercury is 20 degrees below zero? Do they come in the balmybreeze of the south, or over the snow-capped hills of the far west?Do they steal into our rooms with the chilling evening draft, or arethey breeding untold millions in the cozy nooks? Do they ridetriumphantly on the crest of the winds, leaving, like the terriblesimoon of the desert, death and destruction in their path? Are theyso constituted that no amount of heat or cold affects them? Why isit that these breeders of disease flourish in the coldest weather aswell as in the heat of summer? Where is their rendezvous? Are they propagated and reared on the snow-capped peaks of the Rockies? Do they grow and flourishamong the cacti on the great American desert? Are they foundthriving in the Everglades of Florida or crouched among the vine-clad hills of the Alleghenies? They must have a place of origin and the anxious uninformed would like to know where. Why should we suffer because ofignorance when there is so much known of micrology? The scientist tells us that they are held in solution in the water we drink. Why then are not all who drink the same water afflictedalike? Why do they drink diphtheria bacilli today and typhoidgerms tomorrow? Why are not all taken down with microbes atthe same time? When the typhoid bacilli are pumped through thewater mains, why are not all confined to their homes and businesssuspended? If they are in the air we breathe or the water we drink,what benefit are quarantine regulations? Should not the origin ofthese germs be found and means taken 126ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS for their annihilation? Is it not possible that they cannot be discovered before the disease has fastened itself upon our bodies? If they are the cause, why cannot these great minds discover them before they create disease? Why do we not read in ourmorning paper that tuberculosis miliary germs are prevalent? Whyare we not forewarned that diphtheria Klebs-Loefler bacilli are inthe air or water before someone has become foul? Why is it thatthe microscopic organisms are discovered all at once, like themaggots in a decaying carcass? It is a fact, as claimed by the wise and learned, that those microbes in the air we breathe, which cause pleurisy, can bealmost instantly killed by application of a mustard plaster; whilethe micrococci causing a fever can be only exterminated in twenty-one days by large doses of quinine and ice-cold packs, and then thelittle cannibals give up the ghost and die because of old age? Whydo they last twenty-one days? Why cannot they be abolished atonce, as in pleurisy? Why last for months as in rheumatism,cancers and consumption? Is it possible that after all this scientificresearch that these wiseacres have not yet discovered a means toeradicate them? If cancers originate in an embryonic epithelial rudiment, or owe their growth to the multiplication of epithelial cells, as stated bythose who make pretentions to wisdom, why do they not find away to breed out instead of in, these microparasitisms? Why do they tell us that a powerful emetic, which relaxes the whole system, will destroy the infusoria or membranous croup?How did they discover this? Was it from their own knowledge ofmicrococcus, or some loving mother who, in the absence of aphysician, administered alum and molasses in order to save the lifeof her child? If a relaxation of the system will destroy themicroscopic organisms of the croup, why will it not destroy otherinfusoria? They ought to know, and who should we not know? Ifwe are informed, we will take every precaution to exclude theintruder; but it must be made plain or we will hesitate to obey andask why. If an antitoxin is a sure eradicator of Klebs-Loefler bacilli why cannot we have an open-mouthed vial standing on our mantel, inorder to impregnate the air so that we will be sure to escape thedisease? If quinine is sure death to fever germs, please tell us howmuch we must take daily to make our system immune and perfectlysafe. Is it necessary to apply a mustard plaster to our side each night to ward off the inflammation of the pleura? If so tell us the size ofthe plaster and how it must be made. Must we put in our bathcertain drugs to destroy the germs of rheumatism? If so, tell us ofwhat kind and quantity. Must we eat certain herbs that we mayescape appendicitis? If so, give us the name and quantity to beused. Why not propagate cancer microorganisms and inject theserum into all those who fear a growth 127THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC by multiplication of the epiblast, hypoblast, or acinous glands of the epithelial cells, thereby suppressing the origin of all malignantgrowths? If, after all these years of research, you cannot discover these microbes before they have fastened their cruel fangs in your flesh,is it not beneficial and necessary that you give us the benefit of theknowledge gained by your investigation? Why not issue a bulletin each day in every town and hamlet, as does the weather signal service, stating what particular diseases areto be guarded against and the means to be employed? Why notpresent a bill to Congress and get an appropriation for this bureau,for it is more essential than the weather signal service, which onlyaffects our business, while these microscopic organisms affect ourhealth, upon which depends the gaining of a livelihood and themaintenance of our loved ones? If you do not come out boldly and tell us that you have been guessing, that you have exhausted your knowledge, that you havediscovered the germs of disease until they have appeared in oursystems, that you can only treat diseases and do not remove thecause, then we will cease to take your opinion as law and will lookfor a Chiropractor who knows where to find and how to adjust thecause. \"UNCLE HOWARD\" NUTTING. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 FRACTURES OF THE SPINAL COLUMN. Stimson says fractures of the vertebrae are relatively rare, being about five per cent; they are extremely unusual in childhood andold age. Fractures of the vertebrae are uncommon, even more so than the medical men suppose, for many subluxations are thought bythem to be fractures. Cooper says every kind of joint is not equally liable to dislocation. Experience proves that in the greater part of thevertebral column luxations are absolutely impossible. Boyer has set down that luxation of joints with continuous surfaces are impossible. We must remember that when an M. D. speaks of a luxation of a vertebra, that he means a complete separation of its two articularsurfaces, which is usually accompanied with fracture. Kirkland observes there are some luxations which are far worse injuries than fractures. Of this description are dislocations of thevertebrae, which can hardly happen without fracture, and arealmost always fatal. Cooper remarks, the large surfaces with which the vertebrae support each other, the number and thickness of their ligaments, 128ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS the strength of their muscles, and the vertical direction of the articular processes make dislocation of the dorsal and lumbarvertebrae impossible, unless there be immense violence, sufficientto cause fracture of the articular processes. It is certain that mostof the cases mentioned by authors as dislocations of the lumbarand dorsal vertebrae have only been concussions of the spinalmarrow, or fractures of such bones. The os occipitis and first cervical vertebrae are so firmly connected by ligaments that there is no instance of their beingluxated from an external cause, and were the accident to happen itwould immediately prove fatal by the unavoidable compressionand injury of the spinal marrow. We find in Gray's Anatomy that the many joints of which the spine is composed render it liable to sprains. Don't forget that the M. D.'s sprain is the Chiropractor's subluxation. Gray continues: \"That ligaments that unite the component parts of the vertebrae together are so strong, and these bones\u2014sointerlocked by the arrangement of their articulating processes, thatdislocation is very uncommon, and indeed, unless accompanied byfracture, rarely occurs except in the upper part of the neck.\" Garish, in his anatomy, says, simple dislocation between two vertebrae is almost impossible, unless perhaps in the cervicalregion, where the surfaces of the articular processes are morenearly horizontal. This is borne out in practice, where we findfracture-dislocation the common injury, the process or neural archbeing commonly fractured, if not the body itself. In Vol. 11 of McClellan's Regional Anatomy, he says: \"Dislocations and fractures of the spinal column are especiallygrave. A simple dislocation of any of the vertebrae can happenonly in the cervical region, as the construction of the dorsal andlumbar vertebrae is such that a dislocation necessarily involves afracture of some part of the bone. Even in the neck a dislocation isextremely rare. Fractures due to direct violence usually involveonly the vertebral arches, the bodies escaping unhurt.\" From these quotations of standard authors you will readily see that the medical profession do not recognize subluxations of anyone of the 52 articulations of the spinal column. They think thatsuch can only occur as a result of fracture; then they refer to acomplete luxation and not to a Chiropractic subluxation. The bodies may be fractured obliquely, transversely or longitudinally; it may be simple, comminuted or impacted. Theinjury may concern one or more vertebrae. The body may becrushed, driving a portion of it into the spinal cord. Thedifferential diagnosis of fracture and displacements must usuallyremain in doubt, for they each present similar symptoms, therebeing no crepitus to decide. 129THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC The prominent sign of spinal fracture is traumatic kyphosis, a displacement with a wounded and abnormal mobility of thefragments. Herrick says it is impossible for any twist, or shakeup, to have sufficient force to fracture any of the vertebrae or their processes,yet direct violence of a blow on the back or falling across someprojection, may cause it. Beck thinks that fracture of the spinous and transverse processes are extremely rare. Helferich speaks of fractures of the vertebral bodies being extremely rare, that of the laminae with spinous and transverseprocesses not common. Beck says that fractures of the transverse processes are still rarer than those of the spinous processes, and their recognition isextremely difficult on account of the thick muscular layerprotecting them. From an examination of The P. S. C. large collection of vertebrae, we find the healed fractures of the spinous andtransverse processes to be quite frequent and about twice thenumber of the latter as of the former. Stimson is of the opinion that fractures of one or more of the vertebral processes, either of the same or the adjoining vertebrae,are common. Howe says that the breaking of the tip end of a spinous or transverse process is not serious. With which I fully agree,because such a fracture does not change the shape nor the size ofthe foramina through which the nerves pass where they are liableto be impinged. Cooper informs us that a fracture of the upper cervical or ?of the odontoid process is always suddenly fatal. Gould and Pyle observe that injuries of the cervical vertebrae, while extremely grave, and declared by some authors to beinevitably fatal, are, however, not always followed by death orpermanently bad results. Fracture of the lower part of the spine isnot always fatal, and notwithstanding the lay-idea that a brokenback means certain death, patients with well authenticated cases ofvertebral fracture have recovered. Stimson thinks that the fifth and sixth cervical, the last dorsal and the first lumbar are more frequently broken than any of theothers. The fragments of a fractured vertebra should be repositioned as near as possible. This will of necessity need careful work and athorough knowledge of the anatomical construction of thevertebral column. The nurse will need to be very careful inchanging the patient's position, so that the fragments will not bedisturbed until they are thoroughly secured by being healed.Owing to the cancellous condition of the bodies of the vertebraethree months may be necessary for consolidation of the fractureWhile there is a fracture of the processes only, mobilization maynot be necessary. 130ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS In youth the epiphyses of the spinous processes are liable to become separated and absorbed, causing them to appear shortened,giving the impression to the uninformed that of an anteriorsubluxation. An examination of the transverse processes will showthat they are in line, therefore the processes are not displaced. The diameter of the spinal cord and spinal nerves are considerably less than that of the canal and foramina in which theyare located. The spinal cord ends at the first or second lumbarvertebrae, but the cauda equina of nerves continues to distributethe nerve fibres, so that partial occlusion of the vertebral canal orforamina does not of necessity cause death. Gould and Pyle state that injuries to the spinal cord do not necessarily cause immediate death. Mills and O'Hara record instances of recovery after penetrating wounds of the spinal marrow. There is a vast difference in impaction of the bodies of the vertebrae which only occur when the bones are in a normalcondition, and that of compression when the softened bones havebeen compressed against each other, changing the shape of theintervertebral cartilage as well as that of the softened waxy bodies,forcing a portion out on one or more sides or posterior in the spinalcanal. Fractures may be the primary cause of softening a part of all of one or more vertebrae by impinging the nerves, thereby creating anexcessive beat as they pass out of the occluded foramina. The importance of fractures of the vertebrae to a Chiropractor depends upon the associated injury, that is very liable to occur bythe occlusion of the spinal canal of its foramina. Where changes in the size and shape of the vertebral canal or its foramina are caused by fracture or displacements, the results arethe same, either of which is very likely to impinge the cord or thenerves emerging therefrom. If the vertebra is deformed by impacted fracture, there will be kyphosis or scoliosis. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 THE BODY IS HEAT BY MENTAL IMPULSE. It will be of interest to learn how the body is heated by mental impulses which creates combustion of chemical arterially and serously deposited and not by blood and, therefore, the blood actsas one of the attributes in preference to performing all the calorificduties thereof. The patient upon whom the first tests were made (July 1, 1903), A. R. Renwick's left hand, arm, shoulder and on up to the spine,was intensely hot. Dr. Palmer drew the attention of 131THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC the class to the excessive heat condition of the portion named; the balance being normal in temperature. He then gave an adjustmentin the dorsal region, which relieved the pinched nerve on the leftside, also the excessive heat of the left upper limb; but he hadthrown the vertebra too far, which had the effect of pinching thenerves on the right side and immediately causing the upper limb tobe excessively hot. He asked the class, \"Is the body heated byblood or by mental impulse?\" He left them for two or threeminutes. He returned and asked, \"Is the body heated by blood orby mental impulses?\" The class unanimously answered, \"Mentalimpulses.\" Thus was this new thought originated. \"Dr. Head, London, England, recently had the sensory nerves of one of his arms divided and studied the sensations. Then he hadthe nerves united by stitching and studied the process of recovery.The result was that he discovered two distinct sets of sensorynerves, one that conveys the sensations of pain, heat and cold, andthe other sensation of touch. \"The discovery also makes possible the accurate localization of the sensations. The healing power of the skin is found to dependentirely upon the set of nerves that convey impressions of pain,heat and cold.\" The above quotation corroborates one of the underlying principles of Chiropractic, viz.: the temperature of all animatedbodies, whether human or animal, is maintained by calorific andfrigorific mental impulses. This discovery was made, as abovestated, seven years ago, without severing nerves. Chiropractic stands head and shoulders above all therapeutical methods. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 NATURAL BONE-SETTERS. A. J. Howe, A. M., M. D., in his valuable Treatise on Fractures and Dislocations, on page 256, says of these Bone-Setters: \"A few individuals have the credit of being bone-setters, but their merits, so far as they go, depend more upon tact than skill;and the prevailing credulity of the people has given them morereputation for ability than might reasonably be expected from theirlimited success. \"A family by name of Whitworth, in England, and another by name of Sweet, in Connecticut, have assumed to possess thesewonderful inborn qualities. For two or three generations, one ormore of the male members of these families claimed to possess asecret power of reducing dislocated bones; and not a few personsof average intelligence give credit to these preposterousassumptions. Any uneducated man with a large endowment ofboldness and self-assurance, claiming to be a natural bone-setter,could, by giving every distorted joint coming in his way a severe 132ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS pulling and twisting, accomplish some cures; the successes would be heralded far and near, and the failures would pass unmentionedand unremembered; consequently he would soon gain considerableexperience in handling defective joints, and if he proved to be agood learner he would acquire considerable skill in his pretendedart. Having received no lessons in anatomy and surgery, successeven in a single case would be accepted by the popular mind aspositive evidence of the Innate power. Love of the marvelous is soinfatuating that every age will have to endure its quota ofimposters. However, it is not to be denied that these charlatanshave done some good indirectly. The fact that a dislocated bonecould be reduced by manipulation without the aid of pulleys andother instruments for multiplying force, led such discreet surgeonsas Dr. Nathan Smith to put the manipulating plan into successfulpractice. The Whitworths, Sweets and others of their order, studiously keep to themselves the plan of operation, though competentobservers declare that it is not essentially different from the plannow followed by the most intelligent portion of the profession.Being aware of their general incompetency in surgical science,these natural bone-setters preferred to keep secret the littleknowledge they possessed, hoping to retain this meager advantageover those who in other respects were their superiors. Probably asimilar feeling actuated the Chamberlins to keep as a secret in theirfamily a knowledge of the obstetric forcep. Such detestableselfishness, by a law unvarying as that of gravitation, will taint thename of those who in any branch of the healing art withholdknowledge which accident or genius has placed within their power.Anything in medicine or surgery which will benefit our fellowmanought to be the common property of mankind; and he possesses asordid viewpoint who, from selfish motives, will not promulgate asecret which will ameliorate the condition of the unfortunate. Thedabbler in secrets is, by the common consent of all good men,branded indelibly with the disgrace that cleaves to the quack andcharlatan. \"It seems a pity that somebody before Dr. Nathan Smith's time did not take a hint from the Whitworths or Sweets, and study outand put in practice a principle of reduction in dislocations whichwas demonstrated by those charlatans to have an existence.Perhaps the spirit of the profession was too arrogant to receivesuggestions from such a source. Unfortunately for the world, goodideas are too often kept from seeing light on account of theilliberality of the influential classes.\" Howe is the only author who makes mention of the \"bonesetters,\" and reluctantly admits that Dr. Nathan Smith wasthe first medical man to take the cue from the bone-setters andadapt hand manipulations to set displaced joints. In time theChiropractors will be given a similar credit for ability andignorance. 133THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC The Sweet bone-setters live at Sag Harbor, a small town situated at the east end of Long Island, New York. The old doctorhas been dead for several years, but his children, Steven, Charlesand Mary, still follow the business of bone-setting. Many amusingstories are told about the old doctor. He was asked by a physicianwhere and how he got the knack of setting bones. He said: \"Don'tknow, just came to me all of a sudden one day when I had caught achicken and was about to kill it. But first I began fiddling with it,and first thing I knew I'd pulled a bone out of place. In putting itback I pulled another out of place, and I pulled another out of placein putting it back. Then when I'd got 'em all back in place I got anidea I'd learn how to set bones and give up farming. So I practiceduncoupling and coupling up the bones of my dog until I learned theright twists for setting all the different bones. Guess I took thatdog apart nigh unto a hundred times, on and off. He got so used toit that he seemed to enjoy it, and I do believe he missed theexercise when I let up on him.\" Sweet always refused to explain to anyone except his family, the peculiar twists that were required to set bones. The old doctorhas migrated to a country where there are no bones to set, but hisfamily continue the business with such dexterity and rapidity thatphysicians can not get the Sweet twists. A New York drummer, while at Sag Harbor, heard of the bone- setter and said: \"Bet he's a fraud, and I'll prove it, too, if youfellows will bind up my shoulder so it will look as if it's brokenand then call Sweet.\" The shoulder was wrapped and Sweet was summoned. When the doctor arrived the New Yorker was groaning as if sufferingintensely. Sweet examined the shoulder, smiled, and told him toraise his arm. The drummer could not raise his arm, and insistedthat the shoulder was out of joint. \"You bet it is, stranger,\" said Sweet, \"and they'll not get it back into place until you and your friends have paid me $25 for putting'em back.\" The amount was finally raised; then Sweet gave theman's arm a jerk or two which placed it in its socket. Thisreminds me of two incidents, one which was played on me as ajoke, or to find out what there was of adjustment, or to expose mybusiness. A certain physician, with an assumed name, called with his wife. He claimed to have neuralgia in his left shoulder, and paidme the regular fee of $10. I failed to find any cause. He then toldme who he was, and that he had no neuralgia, and wanted hismoney back. He threatened in vain. I kept the money and he hadthe experience. Rev. McCurdy, a former Methodist minister of this city, had hemorrhage of the lungs, for which he took adjustments until hewas well. One day he brought Rev. Smith, who did not believethat displaced vertebrae would cause disease. So I asked him if beever had rheumatism. He replied in the nega- 134ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS tive. I offered to give an adjustment in order to show him that vertebrae could be displaced, and that such would make disease.He accepted the offer and I displaced a lumbar vertebra so as toproduce sciatica. About two hours after he returned and said,\"Rev. McCurdy says if you can make rheumatism, you can alsoremove it.\" His rheumatism and skepticism was removed byreplacing the vertebra. A Fifth avenue millionaire's mother, in her seventieth year, dislocated her hip by a fall. The best physicians of New Yorkfailed to replace the head of the femur. The man of wealth hadheard of Steven Sweet and his bone-setting while out hunting inthe vicinity of Sag Harbor. So he sent for him. A day later the door-bell of the mansion rang. The butler opened it and saw a large man with a clean, flowing white beardand clothes that were well patched. The butler asked, \"Are you-ah-Mr. Sweet?\" \"I'm Sweet, the bone-setter,\" was the answer.The butler had expected to see a different looking man andhesitated about letting him in. Sweet became indignant and said,\"I don't come here to be kept waiting on the door step, and what ismore, I don't give a d--- for the case.\" The bone-setter started to return home. The butler told the millionaire of the tramp who said he was Sweet, the bone-setter.He was soon overtaken and the mistake corrected. Gently hehandled the displaced limb; suddenly before onlookers knew whatwas being done, he gave a twist, and with a snap the bone was putin place. \"Now,\" said Sweet, as he turned to go away, \"I'm noblundering doctor, thank the Lord; I'm just a bone-setter.\" Fifteen minutes later Sweet left the house with a $3,000 check in his pocket. He had asked for $50. I presume Sweet's bone-setting was done by knack and not strength. The doctors watched him setting bones, but could notcatch onto the \"secret.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE \"SWEET BONE- SETTERS.\" Newark, N. J., Oct. 18,1905. B. J. Palmer, D. C. Dear Sir: In writing of Chiropractic in The History, of Medicine (Maine Farmer Publishing Company, Augusta, Maine), I aimed, with limited space and information at hand, to tell the truthcandidly, with good will at heart. Whether I defined\"Chiropractic\" accurately is a matter which speaks for itself. I amfar from being beyond making mistakes, but I do not do sointentionally. I did not consult a lexicon, but rendered the term aswe commonly do, with what it signifies, hand practice. But Lidelland Scott, I observe, define pratikos to denote practical, 135THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC effective, etc., which will justify your criticism. It would, however, have suited my martinet temper better if the science hadbeen named Chiropraxis as being more in conformity with theGreek, and then the term Chiropractic would have been the properadjective. But you are no worse than others. But before I attempt to pass judgment upon your procedures, I would like to see an example. I have my prejudice to surmount,although the notion of referring all complaints back to the spinalnerves hardly seems to me supported by facts. I have been in thehabit of regarding the ganglionic or sympathetic system as moretruly a center of disturbance. If, however, you make cures, that isthe main thing to be considered. You may be assured, however, that I concur heartily with your views on medical legislation and vaccination. Both are outrageousand should be denounced by every intelligent, conscientious man. To impregnate a person with disease matter, whatever the law or profit, is crime and a cruelty, as well as absolutely irrational. Ifanything justifies widest resistance, it is compulsory vaccination. A few days ago a physician, a friend of mine, was conversing with an orator in Providence, R. I., and took the occasion to speakplainly of the \"facts\" and humbugging utterances, now so commonwith the profession. \"Do you say this publicly?\" the other asked.\"I do,\" he replied. \"But,\" pleaded the other, \"we want business.\" There is the secret of the obstinate persistence in regard to vaccination. A large part of the profession are conscious of theutter uselessness of vaccination, but they \"want business.\" As for the medical statutes, those which we now have, bad as they are, they constitute only a beginning of what is contemplated.The \"elevating of the standard\" of instruction bas little to do withany endeavor to have able and better practitioners, but only tomake the study so expensive that only a few will undertake it. Oneof the exploiters of the policy set it forth thus, ten thousandstudents would be in the medical colleges and two thousand ofthese would graduate each year, which would supply the numberof new doctors required. This facilitated a national board of examiners which was to take the place of the present state boards, and the license would heuniversal. The result thus aimed at was not only to have the parent school supreme, but also that henceforth physicians would be gentlemen. All Homeopathists, Eclectic, or what not, who foster and support medical laws, are thus helping drive nails in the coffin ofthe respective schools and to destroy their own brethren. Mr. Lincoln's Gettysburg speech can thus be paradoxical by a government of the people, by the doctors, for the doctors. 136ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS What then for the acknowledgment so often made by learned men or their workers who prowl like jackals around legislaturesthat, on the whole, the medical profession is the source of moreinjury than benefit to human beings. In the paper which you recently published in relation to the \"Natural Bone-Setters,\" the Sweets, you repeated things that werenot correct. Their origin was misstated and their methods hardlyreceived justice. I care nothing for the authority to which youapplied. I know something of what I am saying. An ancestor of the Sweets had an office in the British army and taught his art to his children. They made their home first atKingston, R. I. They were all carefully instructed in their art, but itseems to have been a rule with them that only one should engagein the business in the same town. It may be that some of them were tricky and charlatans, but as a general fact, they were simply country folk, hardly as wary andworldly wise as others. They were herbalists as well as bone-setters and procured their own simple remedies in the woods andfields. One of them lived and died in Newark. He was plain in manner, unpretentious, but diligent in his pursuit. When in theoffice he stayed behind the counter with his coat off and sleevesrolled up. His tact and perception, however, seemed almostsuperhuman, and his probity could not be questioned. Dr. Job Sweet represented the family at Kingston in the time of the Revolution when the French troops under Rochambeau werestationed at Newport. His services were employed with them as asurgeon. The daughter of Aaron Burr, while yet a young girl, hadthe misfortune to dislocate her hip. Col. Burr sent for Sweet tocome to New York and replace the limb. He came by ship, butwas with difficulty persuaded to enter Burr's carriage at the pier,lest there was some contagion. Coming to the house of RichmondHall, now Varick street, he greeted his patient and then applied asalve or ointment to the region of the injury. After some hours, ashe was about to go to bed, he asked to see her again. In a momenthe had replaced the bone, then calling for a staff, he made herwalk. Next day many people and a score of physicians came to seethe operation, but Sweet had returned to the ship and was on hisway home to his blacksmith shop. Perhaps I am visionary. I do believe in a world beyond the present one and in a power of perceiving what is not commonlyknown. There is somewhat of the mystic in my mentalcomposition. I think that members of the Sweet family were\"gifted.\" They were not educated in books any more than theirneighbors, and did not make vain pretending. Old Job Sweet oncevisited Boston and a physician took him to the anatomicalmuseum. Passing by a mounted skeleton he stopped and called 137THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC attention to it. \"I never saw a toniny before,\" said he, \"but that bone in the foot is wrong side up.\" This was disputed, but hechanged its position, knowing that he was correct. The lateThomas A. Hazard stated in his History of the Hazard Family, andhis veracity and intelligence are beyond question: A son of Job Sweet was operating upon a patient with a broken thigh. A bystander, who knew him to be uneducated, asked himhow he was able to replace the bones so exactly. He replied hecould not tell, but that he was as certain of the position of thebones when he was operating as though he saw them with thenaked eye. A grandson, equally gifted, made the following statement: \"I see the bone that I am going to set just as plainly as if it had noflesh upon it.\" Mr. Joseph P. Hazard, of Peona Dale, R. I., having, in some athletic exercise, displaced the semilunar cartilage in one of hislegs, applied to various surgeons, Dr. Hazard among the rest. Theytold him that to restore it was beyond the surgical art, he mustcarry his leg bent up all his life. He visited John Sweet, a farmer atwork in the hay field, and secured his promise to give him hisattention. At nightfall he came, well braced by a strong dram ofliquor, as though nerving himself for a stubborn task. It need notbe told that be hurt his patient mercilessly. But the crooked legwas made straight. Sweet gave him a few directions and wentaway. Some days later Mr. Hazard visited to pay him for the operation. \"I have to do a good deal for nothing,\" said he, \"and Imust charge you pretty high.\" The bill was two dollars. Such werethe Sweets of Rhode Island. In 1843, William Lloyd Garrison, the father of the antislavery movement and editor of The Liberator, in Boston, spent the summer at the home of the Fourrerit Association at Northampton.Mrs. Garrison met with an accident, injuring her foot. After anunsatisfactory consultation with several surgeons, they repaired toHartford, where one of the Sweets lived. He speedily adjusted thebones of the injured foot as if by magic. Mr. Garrison wasenthusiastic in praising his ability. Some years ago, it is said, a Dr. Reid, of Rochester, N. Y., obtained knowledge of the Sweet procedure and announced it to\"the profession\" as his own discovery. I have heard the late Dr.Morton Robinson, of Newark, describe it. He was a fellowtownsman of the Sweets in Rhode Island himself, a descendant ofthe Hazard family, and for years a partner of Dr. Jonathan Sweet inNewark. His explanation was very simple. It was by first relaxingthe tension of muscles that were involved and then replacing thebone where it belonged, following the same route which it hadtaken when fractured or dislocated. In this way there would belittle injury, and the torments to which patients had formerly beensubjected would be obviated. 138ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS I have told a long story, longer, perhaps, than you have patience to read. It is at your service, in whole or in part, for publication orthe waste basket. But it is true to the dead, as well as the living. ALEXANDER WILDER, M. D. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR. Many abnormal physical \"phenomena\" are met with in daily practice. They are considered \"phenomena\" because the etiology, how and why, are not known. Could the practitioner have a comprehensive knowledge of the source of power, its manner andhow expressed to produce the normal manifestations of life, thenthe abnormal would be the interference. Without knowledge ofboth, the intervening steps can never be understood. It is interesting to a Chiropractor to read medical works, to see how they continue to stumble over in their endeavors to find thereal cause. They insist in looking for the cause of ailments,symptoms, disease, outside of the body. If the same degree ofdiligence was given in searching within the body, success would have been obtained long ago. McClelland's Regional Anatomy, 1892, shows the nearest approach to the Chiropractic cause of disease of any medical workto my knowledge. The P. S. C. has made comparison an important study, having for that purpose a most complete library. It is almost needless to say that that author was so far from agreeing with the medical order of things of the present date thathis work is now out of print. He gave too much attention to nervesand the corresponding peripheral actions, and not enough to theblood. \"Owing to the complicated relations of the nerves to the various vertebrae, the accurate interpretation of symptoms which mayattend injury or disease of the cord or spine is very difficult.\" It is\"very difficult,\" for he cannot bridge the gap between normal andwhy abnormal, that which Chiropractic supplies. In referring to \"The minute anatomy of the spinal nerves,\" he says: \"They are supposed to preside over the sensations oftemperature.\" He here gives to \"nerves\" the power of controllingthe heat of the body. This sentence should read: \"Spinal nervesconduct mental calorific impulses through specific fibers for thatpurpose. Innate presides over the degree of expression.\" Inspeaking of another set, he remarks: \"These fibers are supposed topreside over tactile sensations.\" He refers to still another as \"Tothese is attributed the conduction of the sensation of pain.\" Thisshould read: \"To these is attributed the conduction of theimpressions which are mentally interpreted as pain.\" \"Both the anterior and posterior divisions of the spinal nerves possess fibres which are called trophies because they are supposedto regulate the nourishment of the various tissues. The 139THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC anterior divisions contain trophic fibers, derived from the cells, in the gray matter of the anterior cornua, (the intelligence of) whichregulate the nutrition of the muscles and bones.\" The regulartheory of the M. D. and D. O. gives to blood absolute control ofthe above functions. This man was, no doubt, ostracized for daringto think. In some of the above names and functions, as given by McClelland, we heartily agree. But the Chiropractor candemonstrate the existence, and goes further, and gives to mentalimpulses the control of all functions of the body. \"So near and yet so far.\" Bordering upon the real manner in which the body controls itself, and then stoppingfor fear the gulf,into which he had looked, would broaden and take him in. In this respect McClelland, M. D., is ahead of medical and Osteopathic professions. They are still fighting with the weaponsof bad, congested or strangulated blood, to conquer, compel andmake disease leave the body. They give to the blood the power ofsupplying and controlling nutritive substances. In this chapter, The Region of the Back, he does not refer to blood; the word is not mentioned. I would like to see the book on Osteopathy that doesnot refer to some type of blood in every disease and the treatmentthat is given being to increase or decrease this flow. Dr. McC. published these thoughts in 1892, three years before Chiropractic was born; yet he lightly fingers nerves that \"presideover the sensations of temperature.\" Dr. McC. would have us understand that the same nerves that give heat sense it. Efferent nerves convey impulses outward fromthe brain, the quantity and quality of which regulates that conditionknown as heat. The duty of the efferent nerves is to receive thecorresponding vibrations by making an impression upon the brain,where it is interpreted to a normal or abnormal degree of heat.Two sets of mental impulses are necessary to preside over thesensations of temperature,instead of one. \"Division or complete disorganization of the spinal cord is attended with complete loss of sensibility and motion below thepoint of injury, showing that the cord is the organ ofcommunication between the brain and the external organs ofsensation and of voluntary motion.\" Chiropractic teaches that every peripheral nerve has direct connection with its proper lobe in one of the two brains. Whycould not Dr. McC. have gone further and given credit to the lossof other functions to the same pressure upon nerves? In the above\"injury\" there might have been a lack of heat, anemia, inability torepair fractures, lack of secretion or excretion, etc., etc. Why notgive to the same cause the credit of these also? There are no relay stations in the spinal cord; those manifestations that are known as normal or abnormal \"physicalphenomena,\" called \"reflex,\" are the direct results of action, by In- 140ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS nate Intelligence, upon those impressions, as received by it, from the external by afferent nerves; after which she sends forthresponsive impulses. Impression is received, impulse is theresponse. Instead of being \"reflex,\" they are responsive. Wheredoes the present knowledge, as taught by medical and osteopathicschools, of \"reflex\" actions convey any intelligence? Has thespinal cord a soul? Is life controlled by the spinal cord? TheChiropractor wishes to find an intelligent, masterful mind thatcontrols such complete pieces of work. \"Reflex\" does not meet hiscomprehension. This deficiency has been completely supplied bythe Chiropractic knowledge of Innate Intelligence. Chiropractors prove that all involuntary functions are originally controlled by impulses sent forth from this Innate mind, eachfunction having direct connection with its lobe for that purpose.This includes the nutrition and other functions which areperformed within the brain, the nerves of which originate in theirrespective lobes, pass through the spinal cord, leave a foramen,thence to the tissue involved. This is true of what is medically andosteopathically known as the \"twelve cranial nerves.\" \"When the brain does exercise a controlling influence, the impression received by the posterior root probably crosses to the opposite side of the cord at once, and then ascends to some part ofthe cerebral cortex, whence a voluntary motor impulse descends tothe anterior nerve-roots, which convey it to the muscles.\" Certain truths have evidently been thrust upon Dr. McC., as in the above. He admits a Chiropractic ray of light, but has asquickly shut it off, for fear it will hurt his clear vision. Not beingentirely out of the dark, he hurriedly shuts the door and returns tothe old following instance: \"There are certain actions, termed reflex, which can be accounted for only upon the supposition that the spinal cord possesses in itself the power of receiving and conveying impressions independently of its connection with the brain.\" In the following quotations, which is the end of the paragraph, we find the first gleam of Chiropractic truth, which, in itself,contradicts the second. It can readily be seen that he is treading onground which is not comprehensive; yet, dismiss it he cannot. His reason for supposing that the spinal cord possesses independent power is contained in the following quotations:\"Thus, during sleep, when the (Educated) brain is not exercising acontrolling influence, if an (Innate) sensory impulse is conveyedthrough the spinal nerve, it probably passes by the posterior rootinto the gray matter of the cord, and then the impulse is convertedinto a motor one, which is reflected by the anterior root of thespinal nerve, causing certain muscles to contract upon the sameside.\" Words in parenthesis I have supplied. Dr. McC.comprehends how a voluntary impression reaches the mind, but hecannot see how impressions made during sleep can reach and beacted upon by the mind that is asleep. He has here lost hisconnecting thread. 141THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Each individual has two minds, the voluntary Educated and the voluntary Innate. Innate never sleeps; it is thon who is awakenight and day. It is this person that causes these impressions to bereceived and acted upon through a set of voluntary nerves, thoseover which we have no control. If we could comprehend that all peripheral voluntary nerves reach their individual brain, and from that point the Educatedvoluntary and Innate voluntary impulses are sent out by day andInnate voluntary alone by night, then he would see the uselessnessof the spinal cord \"reflex,\" \"reflected\" system. The source of \"involuntary\" power is credited to the spinal cord by medical and osteopathic authorities. Chiropractors have proventhat the headquarters of Educated voluntary and Innate voluntarypower is in the brain. The media through which the act isperformed determine whether it is under the control of the Innateor Educated mind. This power, regardless of whether voluntary, cannot be stimulated or inhibited. The impulse after reaching the peripherycan be temporarily increased or decreased, but the energy directcannot be reached by medicines, machines, osteopathic treatmentsor Chiropractic adjustments. The underlying principle in alltherapeutical methods (Chiropractic is not in this class) is to useexternal means, of thousands of characters, to stimulate or inhibitthe blood, thinking thus to reduce the expressions of disease.From whence comes this power they think little and reason less. Chiropractors consider all manifestations from the base of control. We do not aim to increase or decrease the quantity ofimpulses but to release pressures upon nerves so that the properquantity of impulses which were upheld are now free to continueupon their regular path to do normal duty. Diseases represent theinability of impulse to reach the peripheral nerve endings toperform their functions. One of the main points to be considered by a Chiropractor is not how bad the disease is, nor how far along it has progressed.Many a serious case, according to effects, will get well in a shortspace of time. Other mild cases will need a lengthy series ofadjustments. The length of time necessarily depends upon theamount of reserve power that can be called upon and utilized afterthe obstruction to the expression of its impulses has been adjusted.This reserve power differs in every two persons; thus, one personcannot be compared with another. To consider the advisability of the outcome from a study of effects is as foolish as to try to cure diseases by treating them. Thequantity of vitality in reserve, which can be used, must beweighed. It is from this point that the rejuvenating process willcome forth, from the brain by means of mental impulses. Whetherthey get well shortly, depends upon how quickly you, as aChiropractor, succeed in taking off the pressure By adjusting thatsubluxation so that mental impulses can do their normal duty. 142ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS \"A simple dislocation of any of the vertebrae can happen only in the cervical region, as the construction of the dorsal and lumbarvertebrae is such that a dislocation necessarily involves a fractureof some part of the bone. Even in the neck a dislocation isextremely rare, and when it occurs, it is usually at the fifth cervicalvertebra, which can be accounted for by the degree of movementof this portion of the column.\" \"Dislocation,\" as taught and accepted by the medical and osteopathic schools, must necessarily involve a fracture of parts.To have a dislocation is to completely separate the articulatingsurfaces, one vertebra completely parted from its mate. Osteopathsdo not know the existence of a Chiropractic subluxation any morethan do M. D.'s. Many D.O.'s are attending The P. S. C. and learning how to adjust them. A Chiropractic subluxation is a partial dislocation, slightly separated from its articulating surfaces. This condition does notnecessarily involve a fracture. The subluxation partially occludesthe intervertebral foramen; the dislocation completely. It is thesubluxation that produces pressures upon nerves as they emanatethrough these openings, hence, impulses are hindered, disease itsresult. This form of subluxation is, as yet, given little credence bythe medical profession. Since 1895, osteopathy has beenpurloining this idea, even to the extent of copying paragraphs ofespecially phrased material of The P. S. C., writing articles about them as the cause of disease. And yet, the same paragraph will tellhow anemia is caused by bad, diseased blood. A slightcomprehension of that which they are trying to make a leaderproves the incompetency to grasp its import in practice. Chiropractic subluxations are known in medical parlance as sprains,\" the result of which, according to M. D.'s, are unlimited.A Chiropractor quickly realizes that the effects following a\"sprain\" are the results of pressures upon nerves as they leave theintervertebral foramina. Dr. McClelland admits the fundamental truth of Chiropractic\u2014 pinched nerves at the intervertebral foramina hinder mentalcurrents. He maintains, though, that \"Caries\" is the cause and itproduces many \"characteristic symptoms.\" He does not attempt tostate what causes the caries. This is a disease and must have acause. What and where is it? \"In different forms of caries which affect the bodies of the vertebrae, although the spinal cord usually accommodates itself tothe progressive pressure, there are certain characteristic symptomsdue to the pressure upon the spinal nerves.\" We must infer that he directly refers to \"pressure upon the spinal nerves\" as they emanate through the intervertebral foramina.The cord is not susceptible to pressure, within the spinal canal, as\"the spinal cord accommodates itself to the progressive pressure.\" 143THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC \"The peripheral pains thus produced can be interrupted by a knowledge of the areas of the distribution of the several spinalnerves. \"When any of the upper three vertebrae in the cervical region are diseased pain is often complained of in the areas supplied bythe occipital and great auricular nerves. \"If the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae are diseased, pain may be referred to the distribution of the sternal, clavicular andacromial nerves. \"If the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae and the first dorsal vertebra are diseased, pain may be referred to the shoulder anddown the arm in the course of the branches of the brachial plexusof nerves. \"When any of the upper six vertebrae of the dorsal or thoracic region are diseased, pain is felt in the course of the correspondingintercostal nerves, and if any of the lower six vertebrae areaffected, pain may be referred to the epigastric, umbilical, orhypogastric region, in the areas supplied by the seventh, eighth,ninth, tenth and eleventh intercostal nerves. \"In the lumbar region the nerves liable to pressure are the branches of the lumbar plexus, notably the ilio-hypogastric, ilio-inquinal, genito-crural, and anterior crural nerves, and pain issometimes referred to the course of the internal saphenous nerve asfar as the ball of the great toe, which can be attributed to spinalorigin rather than to the gout. The pains experienced in spinaldisease are always accompanied by a peculiar constrictingsensation, as if a tight band were clasped about the body in the seatof the affected nerves, and hence they are often denominated girdlepains.\" It will be noticed that the author has confined himself to \"pains\" produced by these pressures. Could he have carried thesubject deeper and expressed himself to mean all functions, asheat, nutrition, excretion, etc., he would have been a Chiropractor;providing he could adjust and rectify the \"caries,\" which wouldhave to be done, not by orthopedical surgery in its hundreds ofdevices and appliances, but by hand adjustment, to correct thatwhich is the cause\u2014the lack of current induced by the vertebral subluxations. The medical profession have, for thousands of years, considered the treatment of ailments of the body. They havestudied the body surgically, medicinally, dissectionally andosteopathically with that object in view. The results of theseobservations are that they have evolved a nervous system foundedand based upon that rock. Chiropractic is the product of study from cause to effect. It locates causes, within the body, then adjusts them; therefore, thatwhich is considered to be the nervous system by M. D.'s could notbe utilized by a Chiropractor, as it is fundamentally wrong; hence,a new nervous system, one which will stand the 144ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS most rigid investigation, entirely different and not to be compared with any precedent. Facts as proven on the living, feeling body by tracing the affected nerves, from subluxation to its peripheral, has made thefollowing necessary. It proved the non-existence of manysupposed nerves. The location, according to sensibility, showedthe wrongly placed location of many nerves according to function.The further development of Chiropractic has to follow itsfoundation; hence, the nervous system, according to Chiropractic,was inevitable. This new system of nerves, their location,origination, etc., was the outgrowth of that unique study, NerveTracing, distinctly a P. S. C. production, and thus supplanting it with a true, practical, rigidly tried system. To the uninitiated this sounds impossible. \"Haven't they found and traced by dissection? \"True, but what evidence can you baseupon the fact that a swollen nerve, after death, was the oneinvolved? To trace that nerve during life is an exact science, for itdemonstrates its true existence, origination, location, function,path and depositing point. To demonstrate that a particular nervewas producing a, certain disease meant that the Chiropractor willfind the subluxation and from that point trace to the affected point,or vice versa. It is scientific demonstration upon the living body ascompared to dissection upon the dead person. Facts vs.Theories.\u2014Demonstration vs. \"Suppositions.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A SPINE-SET PERSONIFIED. I was born into this state of existence, not of necessity, but as a makeshift. I am a believer in transmigration, for I have lived inseveral entities. Many years ago I was an acorn. In time I becamea large tree, and was useful in many ways; but a woodman's axelaid me low. He severed my limbs from my body. Two men witha saw cut me in lengths of three and a half feet. We were, hauledto a mill a mile away. I say we, for as often as the original wasdivided each piece became an individual. The log that I was a part of was divided into pieces nearly an inch thick each way. I was then run through a machine that mademe awful dizzy: When I came to I was round, instead of square,and tapered from one end on which they had left a part of theoriginal flat surfaces. We were tied in bundles and piled in a largeshed, where we had a season of rest. In time we were made intobroom handles. My experience there and the different rooms wepassed through is interesting, but I will not tire you by relating all Ihave seen and heard. Each time I changed hands my valueincreased. At last I was selected by a farmer's wife, who took meto her home. I was placed in a corner of the kitchen. To my surprise, she stood me on my head and watched me as though she feared I 145THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC would get away. I overheard her say to a neighbor, \"A new broom sweeps clean.\" The woman replied, \"The old one found thecorners.\" There came a fall of snow, preceded by rain. Ma (that was what the family called her) took me to sweep the snow from off thedoorstep. While doing so, she fell on me and broke me nearly intwo. I did not say a word, but she screamed for Pa. He carried usinto the house, laid her on the lounge and stood me in my corner.They saw where I was crippled, but did not know why she keptsaying, \"Oh, my back!\" The next morning the family doctor came and looked Ma all over, and said, \"It was lucky that no ribs were broken.\" He, nor I,knew the cause of her distress, but today I could tell him. He lefther some quieting powders. She had a nurse, while I had a stringwound around my body, was compelled to do my usual work andto stand in the corner, where I could see and hear all. One day a Chiro doctor came to our house. He looked at Ma's back, and said that when she fell on the doorstep she displaced oneof the vertebrae of the back. He showed us a string of bones thathe said were like those in her back. He told us which one waspushed out of place. He said he could fix it with a stick andmallet; he had done so with thousands, just like hers. Pa wasegotistical, and quick to catch onto anything which was new. I sawhim look very closely at the bones, mallet and stick. He was anobserver; he sees everything; what he can't learn to do ain't worthdoing. He asked the Chiro doctor what he charged to teach it, andhow long it would take to learn the business. Pa was tired of farmwork and eagerly embraced this opportunity of becoming a doctor,living in town and fixing people's backs. The next day Pa took me to the woodshed and sawed me into three pieces, my portion being five and a half inches long.Previous to this I had always received good work. But such a jobof sawing! I never saw a saw saw as that saw sawed. He blamedme for the poor work, because I rolled. His rough saw gashes areon my body yet. I had my opinion of what kind of a \"Saw-bones\"he would make. He took me to town and fitted me with a rubber cap, which had been made for the lowed end of a crutch. At the five-cent store hebought a two-inch solid rubber ball, and a wooden mallet at thehardware store. He again took me to the woodshed. With a saw and a dull knife he cut a notch near one end of my body. He made a hole, a halfinch deep, in the rubber ball, making the bottom much larger thanthe entrance. He now worked my foot into the rubber boot, forsuch it proved to be. He placed my foot on a piece of wood and hitme on the head with the mallet. My foot slipped. He cut a largenotch in the bottom of my rubber boot, and gave me another blow,saying, \"According to my idea, that will do the work.\" 146ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Pa took his kit of tools to town and learned to be a Chiro doctor. The graduating exercises consisted in presenting him with\"The Key\" and a diploma. They made him swear that he wouldnot give anyone a copy of \"The Key\" except for $500. Pa wasproud of his diploma. He showed it to Ma and all our neighbors.He always pointed to his name when exhibiting it. He told Ma tocall him Doc. Pa tried to fix the bone in Ma's back. He got twochairs, on them he placed the ironing board, and she got her backup, while on the board. He felt of her back and looked at my capand boot. He then slid my boot along the spine, pounding my headall the way. He thought Ma ought to feel better, but she didn't. One day he heard where this kind of doctoring started. He had sold his farm, and wanted to know all about it. The full course forstudents was nine months, but Pa was smart; he learned the wholebusiness in ten days. He could now move the vertebrae by handand, therefore, had no further use for the mallet and me. Pa is builton the thin plan, but he was so swelled when he returned home thatsome of his friends did not know him; he had a swell suit and awhite shirt. He now knew that the Chiro doctor had lynched himfor $500. He told Ma he knew all about \"Chiropractic\"; that the other \"Chiropractics\" were not in it. He examined Ma's back and founda tender place and tried his hand on her spine. I heard a click and ascream. Ma thought that Pa had broken her back. He bad replacedthe displaced vertebra by one move of his hands; that wasChiropractic. Mr. Mallet and I were laid on the shelf as useless.Doc's face wore an angelic smile. His self-conceit knew nobounds. He was neck and head above the \"Chiro doctors\"; whoused the mallet and spine-set. Having no further use for us, heshipped us away. When we were again permitted to see the light,we found ourselves in a large office, lying on the writing desk of aChiropractor. The young man who had received us stepped to thehouse phone and called a lot of students. While they were comingI quickly took a view of my surroundings and saw a picture of Pain one of the class photos. His face looked good where all elsewas strange. We were introduced to the students and the OldDoctor who had put us out of business. The young doctor pulledmy cap and boot off, to see if I was not footsore from kicking andmy head swelled from the soundings I had received. I felt quiteindignant, but what could I do, for I had not learned to talk. It istrue that I often wished I had two feet, like others, for I was oftenfootsore from the spines that I had been driven against. Thus, weare forced in life from place to place, from one business to another,by surrounding circumstances over which we have but little or nocontrol. Wherever we are, whatever we are called to do, let us dothe best we can. Angels can do no more. As I look back over my metempsychosis I find that greatness does not always depend upon size. The smaller I became, the 147THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC more important I was. I have learned to do the best I can in the sphere I am placed. One world is all we can handle at a time. Mylife of usefulness seems now to be at an end. Since my arrival atthis magnificent building I have had but little physical exercise,but I have learned much. We were very much pleased when introduced to another mallet and spine-set. I, thought Pa was a genius. He could put a framearound a cow's neck, so that she could not drink her milk; put ayoke on a goose, to prevent it going through a fence; put a poke ona horse, so that he could not jump; tie a piece of red flannel to ahen's leg, to prevent her from setting; plow a furrow as straight asany man, although the sun warped it while he was at dinner. Yet, Ithought Pa was clever, but my new neighbors were more suitablydressed than we were. The mallet had a rubber head. The spine-set had no cap, but for a boot had a heavy piece of rubber nearlysplit in two, and secured by staples on the end of a carved squarestick. The P. S. C. gave me the name of Spine-Set. He said that some so-called Chiropractors used these sticks to set spines. I heard himtell how and why they came to be used. Up to the year of 1901 The P. S. C. had learned to adjust only the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae. At this date an M. D. was a student. He was desirous ofbeing able to move the cervical vertebrae, for which he devised the mallet and wedge. These were the names used by him. Hetaught another man the stick method. Thus several got to using themallet and chisel to set the spine of the whole vertebral column. When Doc was striking me on the head, driving my foot against the spines of the frightened patients, I daily expected some seriousaccident to happen. In my opinion there were more hurt than weknew of. About a month ago I heard Dr. Palmer read a letter froman attorney, who said \"that a man, thirty-five years of age, wassuffering from tuberculosis of the hip. He was quite comfortable,able to walk and to work fairly well.\" Dr. So-called Chiropractorsaid he could cure him; had cured thousands such as he. Hedeclared that the ankylosis of the vertebrae must be broken up, andhe proceeded to do so by the most violent treatment on the tractiontable, with his fist, rubber mallet and chisel. The result was thatthe patient goes on crutches, is paralyzed in both legs, and is ageneral physical wreck, the result followed promptly after thetreatment. The plaintiff asks for $10,000 damages. This is a case of malpractice, a practice contrary to established rules, and productive of unfavorable results. Will the courtsdecide the above malpractice suit by the established rules of theso-called \"Chiros,\" or those of Chiropractors? Our time is now occupied in observing and being observed. We are shown to callers as \"the Chiros' makeshift.\" When byourselves we talk over our past experience of setting spines and 148ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS wonder why we were used when the hands were so much better. My life has been one of evil and good; some have been helped andothers injured; but I could not have done otherwise, even if I haddesired. I am, Yours very truly, SPINE-SET. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 SUGGESTION, NO. 1. Suggestion has presented us with a copy of \"Auto-Suggestion by Parkyn.\" The author says that it is a demonstrable fact that the benefits derived from Magnetic Healing, Sacred Shrines, Divine Science,Mental Science, Absent Treatment, Christian Science, and thevarious schools of Medicine are due to Auto-Suggestion. We, in alarge measure, will give to Auto-Suggestion the same credit. Butwhen the surgeon sets a fractured limb, or a displaced point, Auto-Suggestion takes no part. When a Chiropractor replaces adisplaced vertebra, or any one of the three hundred joints of thehuman frame, or that of any of the lower animals, he does not usesuggestion as an assistant or a remedy. He has no more use for itthan a jeweler has when fixing the displaced parts of a watch. On page 6, we quote: \"Auto-Suggestion is at one and the same time the worst foe and the strongest ally to be met with in treating mental and physical disorders.\" As we do not treat \"mental\" or \"physical disorders\"\u2014we do not treat effects\u2014we have no need ofAuto-Suggestion as an ally or adjunct. On page 10 we read: \"Every physical trouble in the human body can be traced to imperfections in the blood. Blood supplieslife to every cell.\" This diagnosis tastes like Allopathy. No schoolof therapeutics has dared to refute it. They are all built upon theblood theory of disease; even Suggestion accepts that falsestatement. Chiropractors know that all derangements of the physical are but disturbed functions performed in excess, or a deficient amount.The nerves transmit life action to every part of the body, even toevery cell. Disease is but functions performed in excess, or lackof. All sensations, whether of pleasure or distress, are but theinterpretation of impulses conveyed through nerves, and not ofblood. On page 19 Dr. Parkyn states: \"The blood is the actual healing agent of the body.\" All reparatory processes are the work of Innatemental impulse, and not of blood. This delusion has deceived uslong enough. Mental impulse produces all action; it is the life ofthe body. The circulation of the fluids, including the blood, isunder mental control. 149THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC What has the formation of character, habits, breathing or success by business tactics to do with setting fractured bones ordisplaced joints? We are not running a kindergarten.Chiropractors are discovering what derangement of the humanframe produces disturbed effects. On page 134 we read: \"Would it not seem ridiculous if we found it necessary to instruct our horses or dogs how to breathe asnature intended they should?\" It seems to me to be equally asridiculous for Educated to tell Innate how to breathe in horses,dogs or human beings. If all parts concerned are in proper positionand condition, performing their normal functions, there will be noneed of prompting. The economic functions are performed by Innate as well, or better, in the human infant or the lower vertebrate animals than inthe adult. Educated bothers and worries Innate by trying to directthat which it knows but little or nothing about. Chicago, Ill., Sept. 6, 1905. B. J. Palmer. Dear Friend: The law of suggestion is just as certain as the law of gravitation. A man hears bad news; he falls in a faintingcondition. What caused him? Suggestion. He hears better news,and recovers. What caused him to recover? Suggestion. That isall there is to it. We do not oppose Chiropractic, for it has its use;but don't try to make anyone believe that the mind has noinfluence on the body. That is all we claim; we don't claimeverything, as you do for Chiropractic. Yours truly, ELMER ELLSWORTH CAREY, Manager of Suggestion. The law of suggestion is just as certain as the law of medicine; but the Chiropractor does not need to use either. It is not benefitedby them, except as policy, and even then honesty is to be preferred. Chiropractors have no more need of suggestion when replacing a subluxated joint than the mechanic when entering a tenon into amortise. We do not oppose suggestion in business; we make use of it every day; but when adjusting vertebrae, or other joints, we do notneed to use it. We think that there is some good in all methods, but when a Chiropractor fixes what is wrong, returns the abnormal to normal,what more needs to be done? We maintain that smoking cigarettes will, in time, produce a displaced vertebra, and that by adjusting the displacement the habitwill be abandoned. The article also teaches, by inference, that anundesirable habit will produce displacement in some portion of thebody. 150ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS The smoking of cigarettes produces a poison which is taken into the system and affects sensory nerves. These act oncorresponding motor nerves, causing displacements of certainvertebrae, which, by occluding the foramina, impinge nerves,causing an adaptation for the narcotic. The act of smoking doesnot fasten or form the habit, but the poison which is imposed uponthe nervous system compels Innate to make special changes for itsaccommodation. These new adapted conditions have beendiscovered by Chiropractors. An undesirable habit does not produce displacements. It is not the habit or act of smoking that produces the displacement, but thecontinued absorption of the narcotic. The poison taken into thesystem affects nerves, so that they are forced to make suitablechanges. These acquired conditions have been found byChiropractors and readily handled. All drugs affect quantity of mental impulses. That is what they are given for. Astringents cause contraction of tissue. Tonics andstimulants excite more than the normal action. Sedatives andnarcotics diminish activity. Diuretics, diaphoretics andexpectorants stimulate certain nerves to over-action. A continueduse of any one of the above becomes a habit; a desire is created.But what change is made in the body to cause a craving, a demandfor a special drug? Chiropractors are able to determine wherethese changes have been made, and the best of it is, they are able toreturn the parts back to normal position. The duties of a physician are to observe the effects his poisons have upon the nerves of his patients. They may be administered bymouth, injection, or arm vaccination. Tetanus is a form of spasm,caused by poisons, affecting the motor branch of the fifth pair ofnerves. Mr. Carey further says: \"It appears from your literature that you attempt to prove that everything from a stub toe to yellow fever,and even corns, are produced by displaced vertebrae.\" This statement is not correct. We emphatically affirm that 95 per cent of all diseases are caused by displaced vertebrae. Cornsand bunions (the other 5 per cent) come from subluxated jointsadjacent to the excrescence. We were not the first to discover thatslipped joints in the toes and tarsal bones produced corns andbunions. The S. B. & S. boot and shoe store of this city foundsuch to be so nine years previous. Stubbing the toes displacesjoints; as a result, nerves are impinged and corns produced,because of the nerve that ends in the cuticle being inflamed.Where the joints are not ankylosed, they may be replaced by onemove and the pain disappears at once. We have not had an opportunity to locate the poison, or name the kind, which is the primal cause of the displaced vertebra thatimpinge nerves and cause the excessive heat which the M. D.'sname yellow fever. We do not know that all such are 151THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC caused by an undue amount of caloric. All heat in the body is the product of mental impulse action. On many occasions we havelocated the vertebra, which, by being slightly displaced, pinched anerve, causing an excess of heat, and have released it by oneadjustment. Six years ago I was called to a residence in this city tosee a case of fever. The M. D. had called there four days, and hadno hesitancy in naming it typhoid. In less than a minute thecondition of the patient was changed from that of excessive heat toone of a moist surface and normal temperature. M. D.'s fevers arebut overmuch heat. Yellow fever would come in that list. I do notknow what poison causes the condition, but the same poison thatproduced the first case of yellow fever was also the cause of allsimilar cases. E. E. Carey further says: \"We think that you would have better success if you did not take such radical grounds, for you certainlymust be well aware that there are diseases which can in no possibleway be connected with any physical derangement.\" Friend Carey, we do not know of a diseased condition which has not its cause in some derangement of the skeletal frame. Willyou be kind enough to name one or more of those you refer to?There is no disease without physical derangements to make such. We ate well aware that Chiropractic is a radical change, a new departure; that it has made a greater innovation than all othermethods. We care not, so long as we know we are right. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 SUGGESTION NO. 3. Some time ago Willard Carver proposed that we use suggestion with Chiropractic. He now affirms that we do use it, and desires an acknowledgment to that effect. We here give his entire plea. Our readers can pass their judgment on his demurrer. To avoid repetition and save space, wewill give it in sections and answer it as we go over it. \"B. J. Palmer. \"Dear Doctor: Yours received and read carefully. Permit me to answer, notwithstanding the tone of your letter clearly indicatesthat you leave nothing for me to say. \"The crime of being a young man I will not attempt to palliate or deny. But I will call your attention to the fact that about thetime you brought into existence 'Chiropractic,' the science ofsuggestion was formulated, and wonderful development followed,with which you could not be expected to be familiar, because inthose years you were deeply absorbed in developing one of themost far-reaching sciences of the world.\" Friend Carver, we are just as busy today developing this science as we were in years gone by. However, we are not now,nor have we been in the past, too much occupied to watch theevolution of knowing how to make our suggestions receptive. 152ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS \"I used the word therapeutic, with relation to suggestion, for the same purpose as I would in an argument, or plea in a lawsuit; todraw the fire of the other side, thus getting the benefit of knowingtheir position and strength to use the same against them in thefurther progress of the case.\" You had no trouble in locating our fortifications; you felt the force of our ammunition; now go on with your argument andsuggestions. \"Now, to my surprise, what you said on the subject of suggestive therapeutics is most profoundly conclusive that youknow practically nothing of the science. You should learn thathypnosis is but an incident to suggestion and the best results aremade without it. NOT A MATERIALIST. \"You write purely of mechanics; the reader would be excusable if he concluded that you are a materialist. I, however, refuse tobelieve such; if I thought it were true, I would write you a verydifferent letter, because only a few years ago I was wandering inthat hopeless field.\" You have taken my reply just right. When I explain the cause of disease, I use bones to show material joints which impingenerves that are thereby materially injured and their functionsderanged; the result we name disease. When I go into the realmsof etherial and spiritual, which cannot be demonstrated, but mustbe accepted on belief, then I am not in the field of Chiropractic.One hundred fifty dollars of material should get a substantialknowledge which can be shown to be a demonstrated fact. \"Having thus in short preface swept aside intervening obstacles, let us at once get to the 'meat of the cocoanut' of the wholematter.\" That is right. Get down to something real, that which we can see, feel, chew, eat and digest\u2014the \"meat of the cocoanut.\" \"A perfect system for the reduction of disease will not discard any agent or means which never do harm, but always good, andhas been known by itself or themselves to entirely removedisease.\" \"A PERFECT SYSTEM.\" Such sophistry is used by the champions of each mode of healing. Should we, therefore, adopt every agent and all means ofreducing disease? When we find \"a perfect system\" we will notadulterate it by adding another. \"The world has struggled in darkness, pain and misery for ages, because of the pre-disposition of those who have been able to takea step in advance of their fellows to arrogate to their discovery allthe virtues, and see in it alone the solution of every difficulty. Isay this, not in a fault-finding vein, but simply as referring to avery regrettable human weakness known to all in a greater or lesserdegree. This clearly appears in Dr. B. J. 153THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Palmer's letter, where he asks, 'Would you not like to see Chiro win for itself on its own principle?' I can only answer that I wouldthus be bringing myself within the weakness, for the hope isnarrowing. I would not raise my voice to detract from the glory ofChiropractic in any event, and certainly would not suggest an aidfor it if I were not absolutely certain that it is inadequate to coverthe field of cure, used in the sense of destruction of disease. Itshocks my natural prejudices even then.\" Chiropractic \"is inadequate to cover the field of cure.\" Where would this science be today? How much would have beendeveloped? How many diseased conditions would we have locatedthe cause thereof, if, when we did not succeed in removing thecause by the first effort, we had resorted to some one of the many therapeutical methods, which treat effects? We would have madebut one step forward and that would have been retracted back intosome one of the many systems which had not discovered theprimal cause of disease. \"Destruction of disease\" is Allopathy. Chiropractic does not destroy; it is founded on the reparatory plan. We make right thatwhich is the cause of wrongdoing. \"If I were an enemy of Chiropractic, or even a lukewarm friend, I would keep still, and concede that your very good letters hadconvinced and silenced me, and I had allowed the giant to go hisway, deprived by prejudice of more than half his strength. But notso, for I am a Chiropractic enthusiast, and never permit anopportunity to pass without taking up the cudgel in his behalf. \"I say Chiropractic is inadequate to cover the field of cure. I would not make such a statement without a logical reason, and onewhich, to me, is entirely satisfactory. Let me see if I candemonstrate its reliability.\" Chiropractic would always remain inadequate if its developer would resort to some therapeutical treatment, as many have done,instead of using the principles of Chiropractic to locate the cause. \"You say Chiropractic is purely a mechanical science and consists wholly in the adjustment of subluxations. It has to dosimply with keeping all of the articulatory processes of theorganism in proper position. In other words, it consists of andfinds its ideal condition in a living body, in which all the joints arein their normal position; it is based on the rule, that if all parts of amachine are in their proper place, it will operate perfectly. Is it notso?\" You understand Chiropractic principles. So far you are right in your presentation of the case. Go on. \"I grant you, this would be true if the basic principle were a law of nature; but therein lies the difficulty. Let us examine this underthe proper test and see what it is. If it has one exception, then it isnot a law of nature, for such\u2014it is self-evident\u2014 154ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS must be universal in its application. Solely from a mechanical standpoint, I grant that the rule is universal; but whenever wetouch the human body, and perhaps any animate being, we aredealing with that which is not mechanical. The law will notuniversally apply, unless it may be said, the mechanical alwaysgoverns that which is not.\" If the mechanical, animate or inanimate is in running order, every part in its proper place, then it will go all right, its functionswill be suitably performed, when the force is applied. While themechanical never governs the life principle, the living force alwayscontrols the machine in proportion as it is adapted to the work tobe performed. This is true whether the being is run by Innate or anengine propelled by steam. \"With this thought in mind, let us examine a locomotive. There it stands on the track; every bolt, tap, lever and journal is perfect.The water in the gauge stands at the proper height. The coal isplentiful and properly distributed over the grate, yet this pondrousmonster does not move. The articulative parts of this are perfect;there is no work for the machinist. What is needed? Somethingnot mechanical\u2014combustion, life. This is applied; the engine isalive, but it burns coal too fast, klinkers the grate; the gauges showlow water and a high pressure of steam, which is blowing off; fuelis being wasted; its wheels slip on the rails; it cannot pull a normalload.\" ADJUSTMENT NEEDED. You have, in your mind, given us a perfect machine. But upon close examination we find that its mechanism is faulty; severalpieces are out of alignment, or not in apposition; thedisarrangement of its parts cannot produce the desired results. Itsfunctions are improperly performed; it burns too much coal; the damper and grate are out of order; its parts are not properly placed;the gauge indicates low water; steam is being wasted, because thevalves are not properly adjusted; the wheels slip on account oftheir articulating surfaces not being in apposition to that of therails. \"You say, the engineer does not understand this machine.\" No, Sir, we state emphatically that the propelling power, whethersteam or Innate Intelligence, can and will run either the animate orinanimate machine, make each perform their normal functions, thelaws of kinematics cannot be otherwise. If the mechanism of theserespective machines are not luxated, their functions will beperformed with satisfaction. \"But I am helpless; there is nothing out of place with this engine.\" We do not admit your statement. A master mechanic can by a careful examination find the cause of functions performed toomuch, not enough, or not at all. When all parts are placed in theirproper position, then the propelling power can run the 155THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC machine as desired. If I had a machinist who claimed to understand his business, who could not find and adjust the displaced partswhich cause irregularities mentioned, I would dismiss him. Hissuggestions might suit Dr. Carver, but I want a man who couldadjust the machine. \"The whole trouble lies with the things not mechanical. The intelligence, combustion, and steam, which are back of andsuperior\u2014so far as this engine is concerned, to the mechanical.Teach your engineer and fireman their business, and normal workat once results.\" The engineer and fireman (Innate and Educated Intelligence) understand their business. Each has his special work to do, whichhe could do, if the machine was in working order. The combustionand steam would be in normal degree and amount, if the enginewas properly adjusted. It is not the fireman's duty or business toadjust displacements. The engineer should do that\u2014and will, if hehas been so instructed\u2014just as Educated Intelligence should repairthe human machine when out of order. Suggestions will not repairthe engine or the human. They have to act. \"Look at the human babe. It is mechanically perfect. It is the engine with the properly filled boiler and lighted furnace.\" The babe and the engine, if mechanically perfect, will run all right; each will perform all the functions that belong thereto, innormal quality and amount. \"It is mechanically prepared to do normal service, but its mother restrains it, and constantly mentions that it has delicatehealth, will not live long and cannot play like other children.\" RESTRAINT MAY CAUSE ABNORMALITIES. The mother, in her restraining, may not give it sufficient food and water; she may abuse the child physically; if so, it suffers. Butthe lying suggestions are discovered to be deceptive, much soonerthan the mother is aware, and the child steals itself away to satisfyits growing ambition and strength. \"Its body becomes emaciated, but it suffers no subluxations. It accepts all its mother's statements, believes them to be true, and, inconsequence, becomes pale, weak and emaciated. The difficulty isnot mechanical, but is in the intelligence department. As with theengine, per se, Chiropractic has nothing to do. Can Chiropractors reach such a case?\" SUBLUXATIONS DO EXIST. You can safely bet your last dollar on the Chiropractor in just such a case. He would, if a graduate of The P. S. C., at once conjecture that the child, who was pale, weak and emaciated, hadworms. To determine, he would not ask a dozen or morequestions, as an M. D., but would look at the under lip of thepatient. Finding indications of stomach irritation and worms, hewould know that the scavengers were there to consume the de- 156ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS cayed, undigested food, being a benefit instead of a detriment. He would reason thus: Worms are scavengers; indigestion is due tolack of mental impulses. Behind all he locates the cause in the leftside of the vertebral column. He finds the nerves of mentalimpulse transmission pinched in a foramen, which has been partlyoccluded by a slipped vertebra. The dislocation may have beendone at birth by a fall, or careless handling by the nurse. TheChiropractor replaces the displaced bone, takes off the pressure,releases the nerves which have been compelled to withhold a partof their vital force, digestion becomes perfect, no decayed food toinvite scavengers; the stomach can then assimilate even the worms.Yes, Chiropractors reach just such cases, thereby proving thatsuggestion is of but little or no value in restraining or promotingthe various functions of the human being, or the engine on thetrack. \"The child's mental attitude must be corrected. The adverse suggestions imprinted on the life mind by the mother must beremoved. This can only be accomplished by suggestion. TheChiropractor may attain such by saying to the child at the properpsychic moment, 'I can make you well and strong.' Chiropractorsnever can correct the child's conditions.\" Educated Intelligence should learn the science of kinematics in the animal mechanism. They can replace displaced vertebra,overcome the resistance by using the levers and fulcrums of thespinal column, free the impinged nerves so that they can supplymental energy to their twig ends, which regulate digestion. TheChiropractor mechanically drives the suggestion home, byadjusting the subluxated vertebra which was the cause of poor digestion. \"With the firebox and the function relations of the fire the mechanic has nothing to do. In the realm of the machine he issupreme. True, he can adapt his machine to the results flowingfrom it, within certain well defined fixed limits, but otherwise he ishelpless in its presence.\" The Chiropractor increases or decreases the heat of the body by impinging or releasing nerve pressure. The fireman regulates theamount of heat by the use of the damper. It is easy to governeither, when you know how. Normal caloricity in animals isretained by the use of frigorific and calorific nerves. \"So it is with the intelligence department. If a subluxation impinges a nerve or blood vessel going to that part of the humanmachine called the brain, causing it to act abnormally, namedinsanity, the mechanic\u2014the Chiropractor\u2014is the man for thecrisis.\" IMPINGED NERVES CAUSE INSANITY Insanity is always the result of nerve impingement, derangement of quantity of mental transmission. The anastomosisof blood vessels prevents serious injury to the organs or parts towhich they extend, even if compressed, The Chiropractor and 157THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC the machinist are the ones to adjust the human mechanism when the functions are not normal; and the engine, when the fire, waterand steam are not as desired. \"But if the same or another form ofinsanity existed, arising from pernicious and perverse suggestion,and not impingement, the Chiropractor would be helpless, becausehe has nothing to do with that intelligent force, named the mind orsoul, lying back of the mechanical and controlling it. That whichcauses the heart to beat, the nerves to thrill, the lungs to performtheir functions, the warm blood to continue its circuit of the entirebody; that mind never sleeps or fails to hear the cries of distresswhen in need of intellectual help; that never tires standing guardover the organism as long as it remains animate; that intelligence,which is not mechanical, does not depend upon it for existence,and yet is peculiarly its servant.\" PERNICIOUS HABITS\u2014THEIR ADJUSTMENT. The mind, soul, spirit, nature, instinct, intuition, subconscious mind, or, as I prefer to name it, the Innate Intelligence, which Dr.Carver refers to, runs the human machine, performs all functions ina natural manner, providing it is in proper order. Pernicious habitsmay be contracted: the boy may be advised, suggested to, that lielearn to smoke cigarettes or cigars. The first trial is repulsive ; itacts as a poison but persistent use, continued suggestion. Whatwas done with the boy? What change was made in order toaccommodate, make a demand for the baneful habit? All poisonsaffect nerves, in an Allopathic sense; but the facts are, as learnedby the Chiropractors, the mental brain impulses conveyed bynerves tried to eject the intruder; failing to do this, they do the nextbest; accommodating changes are made by the motor impulses.Chiropractors have discovered where and what alterations aremade. They are able to return the disarranged portions to theirnatural position, thereby relieving the body of its noxious habit.Injurious habits are acquired by making suitable changes in themechanism of the human body. How many times you and I havenoticed a radical change in the appetite of those who have passedthrough a spell of M. D.'s fever, excessive heat. The displacementthat caused the immoderate amount of caloricity also caused thechange of appetite for food and drink. Let me illustrate this bygiving a case. Dr.\u2014\u2014\u2014 now a graduate of The P. S. C., was addicted to the cigarette habit, consuming about two dozen a day.He was taking adjustments for another ailment. The third day heremarked, \"I have to quit taking adjustments, or leave off smokingcigarettes. I have no desire for them; they do not taste good.\" We\"broke\" him of the habit by returning the displaced vertebra. Twodays later a young man who was a patient made the same remark.Thus we have changed the acquired abnormal appetite back to thenatural of those who have used cigarettes, liquor or tobacco. Thecontinued use of a narcotic becomes a 158ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS fixed habit, not because of suggestion, but by suitable changes made in the mechanism to adapt itself to the environment. We,therefore, see that the life mind is not peculiarly the servant of thebody but the reverse. \"That intelligence which, when in control, can respond to a suggestion with such power as to set up the condition of a highfever almost instantly, in a perfectly well person, and in a shorttime return normal functions.\" That intelligence is acted upon by a fright, sudden unexpected news, or a physical injury. These affect the nervous system. Suchsuggestions, whether momentary or continued, may producepermanent changes in the action of the heart, the color and textureof the hair. The functions are deranged by accommodatingchanges made. A large percentage of these are due to pressure onnerves in some one of the fifty foramina of the vertebral column. \"That living principle which can respond to a suggestion, stop action by removing life from the material body (a demonstratedfact). That mind (call it by whatever name you like) that controlsthe functions and operations of the entire being, to which themechanical sustains the relation of an incident, and with which theworkman has no more to do than he has with the element ofcombustion of the coal grate.\" That principle does not, as you say, remove life from the body but sufficient disarrangement may compel that living principle tovacate, because of it being uninhabitable. MIND CONTROLS FUNCTIONS. That mind controls all functions, and like the fireman, creates just the normal amount of heat, providing all parts of the machineare properly adjusted. Innate Intelligence and the fireman, has allto do in creating calorification. All functions, whether in excess,normal, or in less degree, are the expressions of mind throughmental impulse; heat being one of them. \"To the end that man might be and maintain his free moral agency, he is endowed with the power to lodge objectiveimpression on the subjective, or life mind, of himself, calledautosuggestion. That mind is bound to accept them as absolutefacts, not being possessed of the power of reason and analysis. It,therefore, acts upon them as though true, carrying into effect as faras possible\u2014the commands, much to the detriment of the physicalbeing, where the suggestion tends to draw away from health andstrength. It is an evident fact that within the means of self there isno more fruitful source of health than correct auto-suggestions.\" The premises as stated above are wrong. The \"life mind,\" or Innate Intelligence, uses \"the power of reason and analysis\" to a wonderful degree, as is evidenced by hundreds of specimens in our osteological collection. 159THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC \"The life mind, is always open to suggestion, and since our environment has more of unpleasant than pleasant, brings moreforcibly to our notice disease, pain, suffering, etc., than joy, healthand exuberant life. Our auto-suggestions\u2014if we are not advised\u2014become wrong, suggest to our life mind weakness and lack ofhealth. If these pernicious suggestions are not destroyed byaffirmative correct ones, for the purpose of carrying out somesemblance of a smile, we will say in displacement of subjectivemental force, in other words, result in abnormal and mentalimpulse, which renders health just as impossible and disease justas certain as the subluxation of a joint, causing some organ or setof organs to act abnormally, as in catalepsy and many others whichI will leave to your ability to supply.\" COMPREHENSION OF CAUSE. We do not agree with Dr. Carver, that there is more suffering in life than pleasure. Neither do we believe that suggestions causesuch diseases as catalepsy, chorea, apoplexy, vertigo or epilepsy.Each of these are but the result of deranged nerves. Today wecomprehend the cause of disordered functions named disease, andno longer need to resort to suggestions from self, neighbors orwitches for an explanation. \"Now, in the face of these facts and conditions, of which I could cite a thousand cases, what would a true lover ofChiropractic do? Would he discover some way to correct or placeinto its normal condition that luxated mental impulse ?\" A Chiropractor would find why the mental thoughts were not properly responded to; why co-ordination does not exist. Thefireman who would suggest that the cause of the wrong workingengine was in the quality of the fire or steam would be thought anignoramus. The man who would blame the mental for any or alldiscords, named disease, must certainly be a dullard. The inharmony expressed is not mental, but in the heterogeneous condition of parts which are not in properapposition. ADJUSTING THE CAUSE. \"The Chiropractor would say, When I find a joint displaced, I adjust it. I have found displaced subjective mental impulse. Whatshall I do\u2014adjust it? If so, how? By the most simple method inthe world. As simple as a Chiropractic adjustment. By the subtleand wonderful power of suggestion, by lodging upon thesubjective mind an impression correcting the erroneous one. Iadjust the subluxated joint so that the mechanical process of thebody may not be interfered with. I must now adjust this incorrectabnormal subjective condition caused by pernicious auto, orexternal suggestion, so that the secretions and other functionsunder its control will not be interfered with. This I can only do bythe power of suggestion.\" 160ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS The functions of secretion and excretion will be performed in a natural manner, as desired by the subjective mind, if the parts ofthe body so concerned are properly articulated. \"I wrote you at first only to call your attention to the fact that the sciences of Chiropractic and Suggestion are exactly alike intheir object and application and differ only in that the object isattained in the one primarily through the physical, and in the otherthrough the life, or subjective mind, and that they are inseparabletwins. Neither can be fully and successfully practiced without theother. It is impossible for the Chiropractor to practice withoutusing suggestion.\" A \"THOUGHT\" KILLED BY A FACT. You say, \"The sciences of Chiropractic and Suggestion are exactly alike in their object and application.\" This reminds me of abeautiful lecture on \"Thought,\" delivered by Prof. Peck. Near theclose of his pseudo-syllogism he killed all his false reasoning bythe demonstration of an actual fact. A mosquito had lit on hishand. In an unguarded moment he said, \"Instead of waiting tothink of a suggestion, I will kill that mosquito.\" Instantly he suitedthe action to the enforcement of the thought and accomplished theresult desired. \"THOUGHT\" PRECEDES ACT. We will have to allow this one point, viz.: that the suggestion of killing the mosquito and the doing of it \"are inseparable twins.\"We will also concede that, in Chiropractic, we must think\u2014thoughts are suggestions\u2014and act. In this sense, it is impossiblefor the Chiropractor to adjust a subluxated vertebral or other joint,without thinking. \"You cannot possibly adjust a subluxated joint without leaving some impression on the life mind. You depend, and openly say so,for success on the Innate nerves, which are but channels throughwhich the subjective, or life mind, is constantly striving to performall of its functions. If this were not true, no subluxated joint couldbe adjusted. It would be idle to replace it, for there would be nointelligent force to hold it; yielding to the side of least resistance, itwould, by force of gravity, return to the abnormal position. Youfinally succeed by virtue of this subjective intelligence, speakingthrough the Innate nerves, commanding the adjoining tissues,regardless of pain, inflammation, etc., to have it grasp the replacedbone, and hold it in its proper place. By adjusting, you set on footan impulse of subjective intelligence that does it. In other words,you remove an impediment which the subjective intelligence hadnot found a way to do, and it at once resumes its functions.\" 161THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC ENGINEERS AND CHIROPRACTORS ADJUST MACHINES. Now we agree exactly. The engineer removes any impediment, corrects any or all displacements, so that the life force, whetherthat be heat, electricity or steam, can run the engine withouthindrance. The Chiropractor, Educated Intelligence, removesobstructions, pressure on nerves, which Innate has not, nor everwill be able to do. When this is done, in the engine or humanbeing, then all functions are normally resumed. Why did you notsay so long ago? When all parts of the body are in proper position,no displacements, no pressure on nerves, the subconscious mind,Innate, does not need to be reminded of it by suggestion. \"What infinite assistance at this grave juncture could the Chiropractor give this wonderful, intelligent force, if he butunderstood the science of impressing it with strong and correctsuggestions. What astonishing power he could cause it to bring tobear on retaining the adjusted vertebra in its proper place, and byits use ameliorate the distress of adjustment. \"In the cases of Nutting and Storey you used the larvated suggestion; in fact, you always do. You cannot help it. How muchbetter it would have been in the case of Storey if, after having,adjusted the subluxated bone, you had been able to have gone onand driven out of his mind all of those adverse and morbidimpressions. How much quicker he would have returned to thenormal and gone to his family, instead of remaining as he did\u2014aneccentric.\" Dr. S\u2014\u2014 was able to do his own \"auto-suggesting\" after I adjusted the displaced cervical. He was satisfied to live, in LosAngeles without my suggesting. He had no desire to return toDuluth. \"I do not ask you to incorporate into, or graft onto, Chiropractic any form of treatment of disease.\" You don't? Is that the purpose of your article? You should know that we do not treat disease, not even by suggestion. ThereinChiropractic has made a radical change from treating ailments toadjusting the cause of those troubles. \"Suggestion is not a treatment of disease; it is correcting or adjusting the cause in that part of the organism not mechanical.Suggestion goes back behind mechanical, to the very foundation oflife, and has to do with an intelligence which existed before therewas a bony structure to luxate. \"I beg of you to not maim a universal law of cure by confining it to mechanical adjustment; separating it into parts and taking onlythe smaller; thus reducing the law to a rule that has manyexceptions. Adopt the adjustment of subjective luxations, as wellas those of bones, so that the rule of adjustment may apply to themental as well as the physical.\" 162ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS MENTAL READY, BUT OBSTRUCTION STOPS. If the cause of abnormalities is in the mechanical, it is not in the mental. The Innate is ready to perform all functions in a normalmanner whenever its organism is in suitable apposition. TheInnate knows much more about human economics than Educatedever knew. So far as I understand, Innate always did exist; it istransmitted from mother to offspring in all animated beings. It hasbeen making experimental changes in its mechanism, for thepurpose of accommodating itself to new environments. It starts inthe new being with a knowledge gleaned from an experience of alife, the length of which we have no conception. It has as full acomprehension of all its functions, which it runs as intelligently onthe day of its birth as in adult life. It is infinite, unlimited in timeand accomplishments. The Educated Intelligence knows nothing of running the human machine of which it has the outward care. Its education has to beacquired by years of experience. Friend Carver would suggest thatthis upstart of today should dictate, demand of its progenitor andinform it how to run its business, its life-sustaining functions. The animal economy, the functions which run it, are as perfect, or more so, in the illiterate and idiotic of mankind as those ofexalted birth. Why should Educated suggest to those superior? INNATE SHOWS INTELLIGENCE. In many instances we find that Innate has built piers, locks, made grooves into foramina, elongated processes, ankylosedjoints, made new ones in unusual places, enlarged bones toaccommodate itself to new conditions imposed upon it bydisplacements in its skeletal frame. When Educated returnsdisplaced bones to their normal position, Innate will undo thatwhich is no longer needed, as is done, in temporary callus. \"The Chiropractor renders his patient passive for mechanical adjustment. In order to be properly equipped he should know howto render him mentally passive to subjective adjustment, then, thetwo working hand in hand, as the Creator has intended,untrammeled by external pernicious or adverse influence, nodiseased conditions could resist this double-headed adjustment ofthe mental and physical. \"It is because I love Chiropractic as ardently as a school boy does his first sweetheart that I beg of you to bring the science ofsuggestion down to date and make it the working companion ofChiropractic. Please give it a trial before discarding it. Yours truly, WILLARD CARVER.\" 163THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC WHAT IS POWER? How great a counterpart to the study of things as we have them do we find in seeing power expressed everywhere, and how little isknown of power. Energy and force are terms to use, yet how little is known regarding them. We see the \"power\" of electricity onlyafter it has been utilized, and yet, what is electricity? Thisquestion was asked of a class in school. One boy raised his hand.\"What is it, Johnny?\" \"Please, teacher, I knew a minute ago, but Ihave forgotten.\" The teacher looked at him sadly and said, \"Isn't ita pity that the only mortal who ever knew what electricity was hasforgotten?\" Edison makes no attempt to define it. Marconi says we simply harness it; Tesla says we concentrate it; but what \"it\" is, we do notknow. Yet as little as we, as Chiropractors, know about it, we haveat least added one step more to what electricity is than electricityhas in its own study today. Electricians study electricity in volume only, not in detail. We look over the world and two things only come to view\u2014(1) force,power, energy\u2014 and (2) matter. Everything is divisible in those two categories. Matter is reducible into atoms, and atoms intoelectrons, and electrons into we don't, know what; and, after all,we don't know what matter is. We take force in great volume andwe call it electricity and reduce it into currents and watts, and thenthe Chiropractor adds the next deducible step\u2014foruns\u2014and theninto what we don't know. We again reach infinite problems. But,you argue, infinite problems have nothing to do with finite man,and that is true. In the study of the unit we have only to deal withthat unit itself, not with infinite problems in addition. Yet scienceknows no unit in its investigations. Philosophy, Theosophy andPsychology have not stopped at the boundary lines of the shell ofman in their studies; they have even considered the problems ofinfinity, so far as their finite minds could see, think and reason The infinite problems have been brought down as far as they could to the realms of finite considerations, and while we shall tryto confine ourselves to the finite consideration of things before us,yet this is impossible, because of the study of the source fromwhich power or matter comes is boundless; therefore, when weconsider a thing as it is, we must consider what it was and what itis to be; where it came from and to where it is going. As I havepreviously stated, the realm of observation varies because somemen can see only one foot ahead and others can see miles. Onemind can but grasp the problem of the hour, while another graspsproblems of hundreds of years hence. People are advancing weak,foolish, crazy theories today which will be utilizable to minds,thousands of years from now. We have but to look back a shortspace of time\u2014eighty or one hundred years\u2014to realize how littlethis world has known of power, force or energy. We have watchedthe progress of the world in 164ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS its tangible form for thousands of years. It has been handed down in tangible form, and yet, after scanning these pages, going throughand into them carefully, you will find no records where humanmind has reduced the question of power, force or energy into a practical unit. The problems of electricity, if you will call it by its present name, have been deduced practically in the last one hundred years.Up until ten years ago, electricity was regarded as a science,because electricity in infinite proportions could be reduced tofinite quantities and sent through wires for thousands of miles, andwhat more could be wished for\u2014certainly science had reached itslimit. Along came another thinker who said, \"I am going to dothings without wires; I shall send messages and do all that you have done with wires, without them, and I am going to work it onthe simple hypothetical basis that by increasing power and quantitythereof, sending it off with greater velocity\u2014while the loss will begreater in transmission, yet the expression will be carried farther.\" He was scoffed at; laughed at; he was insane, foolish and wild; he was erratic; the place for him was an asylum. What is electricity? It is a current of something going through wires; it is a current of something going through ether, withoutwires. What is this \"something\"? Is it a higher state of vibration?Yes. Of what? Electricity makes no answer, science does notknow, and so as an answer I place the word \"foruns,\" indicating units of force. But to say \"units of force\" does not tell any more what a unit of force is, any more than \"electricity\" tells what acurrent of something is, but it at least disconnects the unit andupon the unit other composite forms are built. Let us take the study of electricity as we see it every day. It resolves itself into three combined sections. A dynamo (1) is a supposed generator\u2014it generates nothing. Generation means to give new life to something which did not exist before. In the technical use of the word, nothing in the world, inany form, is being generated today, never has been, nor never willbe, because the world is but a world of evolving matter andspirit\u2014changing form, character and degrees of forms andcharacters, that's all! This dynamo concentrates or gathers much into small form; it compresses many foruns, in which sense the dynamo is nothingmore nor less than a machine that concentrates. Concentrateswhat? Foruns. In a high state of concentration, then, the dynamo gives foruns to whatever other conducting material is attached. Inall material instances the dynamo has (2) wires. In electrical termsthey are known as positive and negative, the positive wire leading from the dynamo and the negative wire leading to it. The positivewires possess one attribute which the negative does not\u2014thepositive wire is the vital wire, carrying something 165THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC which will do something; the negative wire carried back that which has been utilized\u2014from which an attribute has been lost. This isonly one center in electrical terms and that is the dynamo; that isthe point, place or specific spot from which electricians figureeverything, from or towards; that is the only center\u2014hub\u2014theyhave it. Granting that the dynamo does concentrate force, it must be transmitted, and is, through wires; and to be transmitted it musthave a place to which it can be transmitted. It has, and that is our(3) motor. The motor utilizes that which the dynamo concentrates.Suppose that our dynamo concentrates 100 per cent of current perminute; the transmission of current is equivalent 100 per cent perone minute; the expression of motor function will always be thesame. Put a different phase on this again. One hundred per cent is a standard in decimals; it is the standard with our American dollar; itis the standard of all considerations that I know. Suppose wereplace the 100 per cent of current and say that its product is onehundred revolutions per one minute, i. e., one hundred revolutions per minute, if the dynamo produces 100 per cent of current per oneminute, or say that 100 per cent of current per one minute makesone hundred revolutions per one minute. Thus you see that oneper cent of current equals one revolution per one minute, and thereyou have the unit, showing you that this is a simultaneous action;we will say that one revolution per one minute equals a product ofone per cent per minute. One depends upon the other and the otherdepends upon the one. Another phase. This positive wire becomes positive only so far as it is charged with something in addition to the wire, whichmakes it positive; without that something it is a dead wire. Noticethe question upon the blackboard\u2014are you a live wire? By that Imean, are you positive or negative? How many people going through this world are positive? Not many. There are a greatmany half-live wires; a great many quarter-live wires and there arealso a great many that are almost dead wires. Let us be \"live wires!\" The difference between the positive wire and the negative wire is that one is charged with a heavier voltage of current thanthe other. The reception at the dynamo end of the wire is 100 per cent of current per one minute; or you can reverse it and say one per centof wire equals the transmission of one per cent of current; orreverse it again and say one per cent of current will havetransmission through one per cent of wire, showing again that thefact of transmission of currents is equivalent purely to the amountof wire through which it goes; thus it is simultaneous the larger thewire the more current; the smaller the wire, the less current. Lesscurrent; the smaller the wire, the less current. Less current, then,indicates small wires and more current larger wires. 166ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Go to the motor. One per cent of current at the motor equals one per cent of motor function, or one per cent of motor, functionequals one per cent of current\u2014there's our standard unit ofexpression of dynamic power; the transmission of electricalcurrent or the expression of electricity when it reaches the motor.Reverse the order, and take this on a different basis. Suppose that100 per cent of current equals one hundred revolutions in thedynamo and 100 per cent of current equals one hundredrevolutions per minute in the motor, and then suppose that in thedynamic half of the positive wire we have our 100 per cent ofcurrent being transmitted, and then suppose, in addition to this, weadd or interject a rheostat upon this wire, the rheostat beingequivalent to cutting off 20 per cent of current. As a product of themotor half of the positive wire, we are only transmitting 80 percent of current; we have now cut off 20 per cent. As a product youwill only have 80 per cent of current, and that is equivalent to onlyeighty revolutions per minute in that motor. It is hardly necessaryto ask the question, What would you do in such a case? Theillustration is so simple, so plain, so practical, that you couldhardly overlook the solution. Now, would you begin trifling with the eighty revolutions per minute, stimulating or inhibiting, so that you raise or lower it\u2014to100 per cent, and do all of this by oiling, greasing, injecting orsquirting some obnoxious, vile nostrum into the motor? No; youwould consider such a man ridiculous, most unpractical and veryunscientific. Any electrician would object seriously to having hismotor trifled with in such a manner, nor would he permit of anymechanic to get into the interior of that motor and cut out forty feetof wire, or one or two fuses, or one or two chunks of iron, becauseyou thought they were in the way. Again, let us look to the electrician in our own schoolroom. Suppose one of the lights in the cluster above my head does notgive the light it should\u2014the cluster is not brilliant enough. Itelephone to an expert electrician, \"I have something troublingme.\" He comes. I bring him here and say, \"Mr. Electrician, noticethose globes; they are not giving me the light they should. I wantyou to fix them.\" \"But, doctor, there is nothing the matter with those globes; the trouble is down stairs in the basement.\" \"No,don't go down stairs; the trouble is right here. I can see where thetrouble is\u2014you can not tell me where the trouble is\u2014here is whereI am not getting light.\" \"But, doctor, the cause of all this is downstairs.\" \"I don't care what's down stairs, there is trouble here; nowfix it.\" There is no use of that man trying to argue with me,because I think I know where the disease is\u2014see the symptoms,effects and troubles\u2014the thing I see, feel and know is wrong isright here\u2014not down stairs. May be there is something wrongthere; I won't dispute him; I don't know about that, for it is hiddentinder cover; but I do know about these things on the surface, andthis is what I think he should fix. 167THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC But going back again to our motor. Do you suppose for a minute that the electrician would do otherwise than to remove therheostat, which is shutting off the current? No. That would be hisfirst thought\u2014\"Where is the short circuit? Where have yougrounded the wire? Where have you introduced the rheostat?\" Hisfirst aim and object would be to trace out and follow up the pathsof these wires from the effect back to the location of that groundedwire; or that short circuit or rheostat. He would trace it out, inchby inch, foot by foot, and mile by mile, if necessary. That whichhe would bunt for would be that which interfered with thetransmission of currents. While I know that the thing wrong is inmy globe, or the telephone, or in the fan there\u2014What I see is the effect, and the electrician knows the cause is somewhere else. Is it possible to goad on a tired horse with the whip? For perhaps a foot or two, then he lags. Is it possible to make anentirely fatigued man do more by the injection of whiskey? Iwould say to the prohibitionist who is so opposed to intoxicatingliquors, that more drunkards are being made today by doctors than all the saloons put together. The first taste of liquor is frequently obtained in the sanctity of physicians' offices or the Christianhome in medicine. Now, with the thought of where the trouble is with our motor on our minds, because it is not running up to standard of 100 percent of one hundred revolutions, what we should do is to go backto the place of cause. Once you have found the cause, then it isonly a question of adjusting it. Let us see the value of the two words, \"treat\" and \"adjust.\" An effect is the only thing that can be treated\u2014you cannot treat a cause. A cause can only be adjusted\u2014not treated. These effectsin the lamps, in the fans, in the telephone, can be treated, but theycannot be adjusted. The effect in the motor can be treated, but itcannot be adjusted\u2014only the cause can be adjusted. We talk about adjusting a cause\u2014we don't. We talk about adjusting a vertebra\u2014we don't. What do we do? We are justputting one little bone into place; that does not constitute anadjustment. An adjustment is a re-establishment of currents that isdone independent of us. I have not really re-established thecurrent\u2014I have but put the material things together and the currentre-established itself. We have drawn on this blackboard a practical illustration of things known and seen every day, everywhere, by everyelectrician. I don't care if it is a ten-year-old school boy, studyingthe first principles of magnetism\u2014he has that idea fundamentallyplaced in his mind\u2014he never gets away from it. Electricity doesnot vary; does not change; has no frills or fashions, here today andgone tomorrow; the fashion of electricity today is just the same asit was one hundred years ago, the same as it always was\u2014 that is science. Electricity is brought down to scientific de- 168ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS ductions\u2014the only thing we are studying today is how to apply it more economically; to the best advantage for the best service. Thefundamentals do not vary from the first principles tip. This isworthy of consideration, yet when we jump over to the records ofmedicine we find it is a continuous, wiggly road, strewn withcorpses on either side of exploded ideas, running into themillions\u2014nothing holding tangibly for over two or three years atthe most. By contrast we can also think of the science of electricity, comparing that with the discrepancies of medicine. Electricitytoday has no laws to protect it; science doesn't need laws.Medicine not being a science, needs something to hold tip its tottering form. Are Chiropractors scientists or physicians? Do we,with science behind us, need laws to keep us from falling? I havesaid that science needs no laws. Let us forget electricity for awhile; think of man, and let us look at him as if we had never seen a man before. Let us studyman as if no one had ever studied him in the past; study him as heis in all his simplicity and grandness. Primarily, man is based on a brain, nerves and tissues. Here we really have man complete, and for want of better illustration, we shall call our tissues a stomach. The brain hasalways been regarded as a dynamo. You know this to be a fact aswell as psychologists, scientists and physicians of the old and lateschools. It is not a recent idea; one of the very first fundamentalideas that any man ever thought when he realized the importanceof the mind working through the brain He links the thought of thedynamo with the fact that the dynamo transmits somethingelectrically. The brain has not always been regarded as a human dynamo, but it has had terms, applied which expressed that thought. Realizing that the brain is a human dynamo, which allscientists and thinkers have conceded, then considering that alltissues are as so many motors expressing impulses in every portionof the body, then we must logically conclude that something,somewhere, transmits this dynamic power from the brain to themotors\u2014logical conclusion could not be otherwise. Naturally, then, granting that the normal brain will be equivalent to 100 per cent of current and that the impulse, thetissues (in this instance the stomach) does express 100 per cent ofcurrent (of function, if you will), then there must be something thatconnects the stomach with the brain, which transmits 100 per centof current, and that we have not a positive and negative wire ofcopper, but an afferent and efferent nerve. The nerve has notadded anything new\u2014we are simply compiling our illustration in adifferent form, placing new interpretations upon the world-oldcomplications. We have an efferent nerve which is, in electrical terms, a positive wire. We have our afferent nerve which would be, 169THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC equivalently, our negative wire. We have realized that to have electric light, to have telephonic communication, telegraphiccommunication, movements of an electric fan or motor,movements in anything electrical, there had to be a thoroughlyunbroken current; a through circuit; a cycle of currents which wereat no point interrupted. We must bring this application home toman; that to have a stomach working equivalent to 100 per cent wemust have an unbroken current\u2014an unbroken cycle\u2014a cyclewherein 100 per cent being concentrated, being filtered, as it were,through the minds of intelligence, passing efferently into thatstomach. Then creation, transmission and expression must beequal, that is, getting back to electrical or mathematical terms, ifyou will, if 100 per cent of current is equal to one hundredrevolutions per minute, then 1 per cent of current going into thestomach will be equivalent to one hundred revolutions per minute ;that is, as long as the stomach can receive and express the functionof one hundred revolutions per minute it is doing its duty\u2014nomore, no less. We want neither more nor less; we want ourstandard, and we want that standard to be uniform at all times. This seems logical\u2014it is practical. The only difference we make between man being the same as a dynamo with wires andmotor is the addition of one essential thing and that is intelligence. Man as a compilation is the product of intelligence and but speaks the thoughts of logical inductions and deductions. The dynamowas not made by natural intelligence, neither were copper wires ora motor. Notice the fact that it took man with his intelligence tomake a dynamo, a wire and a motor, therefore, they are products ofman; man in turn is the product of an intelligence, so that we addto man (as an electrical unit, if you will) an intelligence, and whenwe add to man the additional factor of intelligence we take awayfrom human currents the aspect of their being electricity. Thecurrent in man then no longer assumes the character of electricity.The latter would as soon shock a man to death as it would tostimulate him back to normal. It would as soon char a body as itwould attempt to grow plants if it were bright enough over them.We see the all-importance of intelligence behind every act of manwhich makes it a superior thing to the actions behind the dynamoor motor. The motor and the dynamo, however, exist in theirpresent form but a mite of time compared with the time that manhas lived, therefore, man can live without dynamos and motors, butman cannot live without intelligence. Notice then, that while wehave currents in man, they are intellectual currents, and we briefly then, get the idea of age from having currents. Mental currentsindicate that they are the product of the mind and mind is anattribute of intelligence, therefore, they are intellectual cycles. This brings to mind again, the additional factor that 100 per cent of creation, 100 per cent of intellectual revolution, is 170ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS equivalent to transmitting 100 per cent of intellectual currents, and the transmission of 100 per cent of human currents means 100 percent of intellectual function in the stomach of 100 per cent ofintellectual revolutions, showing that every revolution follows anintellectual unit. Suppose that we go back to one of the greatest stumbling blocks in medicine. We have shown you that (granting the point that thebrain is a dynamo, meaning to imply that every portion of our bodyis in touch with that brain) we can only work out this solution bysaying that there must be and is a direct connection. Indirectconnections do not go in electricity; they are not practical; theywill not stand the test, nor are they utilizable to that end. I know you are questioning the point somewhat. I questioned it myself before I was certain of my grounds, which are: that theelectrical circuit, to be complete, must be continuous. To havehuman intellectual circuits they must be continuous matter with acontinuity of current. Continuity of current plus continuity ofmatter means continuity of intellectual function. In the study of man the brain is within the cranium; the spinal cord passes through the spinal canal, and then the passage ofnerves in small bundles out between the intervertebral foramina.These intervertebral foramina are an interesting study. They arenot solid foramen, i. e., the bony structure surrounding is composed of two half circles, one half circle being above and the other below. Each one of these half circles is subject to beingmoved because half of the circle exists as a part of another bonefrom the circle above, or below, as the case may be. This spine, while it is the backbone of man, is subject to many distortions and contortions, twists, jars and wrenches, sprains andbruises, so much so that it is nothing uncommon and is mostcommon, quite so, that every man has one, two or three (up to adozen) of these little vertebrae subluxated, wherein bone, thehardest substance in the body, is pressing against nerves, thesoftest substance in the body. Notice how nicely the nerves that have exit from the spinal cord fill the opening or foramen\u2014you can see what it would mean todisplace one bone or the other, making the opening narrower by afraction of an inch because of the displacement. To producepressure upon nerves means to interfere with the transmission ofcurrents. This vertebral pressure upon nerves is the illustrationthat I wanted to bring in regard to the rheostat\u2014the introductioninto the human body of the rheostat idea; bringing into the humanbody the idea of grounding a wire or the short circuiting ofcurrents. Let us then introduce the idea of a rheostat into our human man\u2014(you will notice quite frequently I make use of theexpression \"human man,\" because I recognize two kinds of men;the man who is dead and the man who is living; the man who is 171THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC living is the human man; the man who is dead is a man, and the man who is half alive and half dead is not human in the fullestsense of the word; he may be mad, raving, a maniac or a brute\u2014may be anything but human). We have noticed the idea of pressure upon efferent nerves and whereas before we had 100 per cent of current being transmittedefferently, we now notice 20 per cent of resistance and we have 80per cent being carried to the stomach, consequently we will onlyreceive in that stomach 80 per cent of power, and as 1 per cent ofpower is equivalent to one revolution, we will now only get eightyrevolutions per minute in that stomach. What are we going to do?Here are two ways: A patient comes to a \"Name? Age? Occupation? Color of hair, eyes; height; weight. Let me see yourtongue and take your pulse. Kidneys working well? How aboutthe bowels? Let me test your heart. Any trouble with your liver?Lungs? Spleen? How about the color of faeces and urine? etc.?\"The answers are to get the general constitutional arrangement.Then he will get specific: \"Do you belch gas; do you have aburning pain in the stomach; what do you eat? Do you havetrouble in digesting it? What foods do you have the most difficultyin digesting?\" To all of this he adds, after all the questions havebeen put and the yeas and nays duly entered; \"You have 'gastritis'or 'heart-burn,'\" or some other name\u2014one is as valuable as theother, or as valueless, perhaps. After listing this detail, his nextthought is. \"What does the Pharmacopoeia say to give this man?\"He scans the pages and finds that for the same effects there areabout four hundred different doses. So be plays a game ofblindfold, picks up the tail and tries to put it on the donkey byclosing his eyes, practically saying, \"Whatever prescription myfinger drops on, that one I will give first.\" There's as much sciencein that kind of guess work as for him to have his eyes open andsay, \"If this doesn't help you, come back and we will trysomething else.\" What should he do? He recognizes there issomething wrong with the stomach. He recognized there wassomething wrong with the stomach, but he is far from being anelectrician; he is far from being analytical enough to go back tocause; he is far from reasoning cause away from the effect; he goesno further in this investigation than to realize that something iswrong in that stomach and it is that something he is going todomineer over and force it to get well\u2014he is going to compel it toget well and if one medicine isn't strong enough, he will get onethat is; this thing must give way to his efforts. Time goes on and the patient gets worse and finally the only permanent relief he gets is in heaven. In the electrician's case werealize that he analytically, logically, practically and scientificallytraces out the positive and negative wires, inch by inch or mile bymile, until he reaches the place where there is a 172ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS short circuit of current. Does the physician do this? No; he knows nothing about the definite connection of the statement that he madethat the brain was a dynamo and that tissue was a motor\u2014hedoesn't have the third link that unites the two things. This iswhere he misses\u2014this is where we gain. We have our direct nervous system connecting one with the other; he has the sympathetic nervous system. Does he think forone minute of tracing these wires inch by inch back to thesubluxation, to the rheostat; to the point of interference oftransmission of currents? No; it is not important; never studiedthat; don't know anything about that\u2014all he knows is to observeeffects. Things in electricity are scientific; things in medicine arehypothetical guesswork. By comparison we have shown that one is equal to the other with the exception that man has the added factor of intelligence.Would you, in the electrician's place, stimulate the motor and tryto make the 80 per cent motor reach 100 per cent? Would you, inthe case of man, try to stimulate the eighty revolutions to do thework of one hundred revolutions? If so, how long would it last?You wouldn't do it, yet physicians do it\u2014it is all they know. Thisis to be regretted, inasmuch as this statement is a fact that issimplicity in the extreme, such as any mind can grasp\u2014I say it isto be regretted that the physician will hold back, try to stifle andchoke humanity from getting the thing they need. Every livingperson in this world should have that idea implanted in his mindtonight; yet listen to the minds, words and actions of those whocould help us to put it there and you will find they are thestumbling blocks, they are the men who hinder progress, who holdus down. Again, this lecture gives you a very simple talking point\u2014a talking point that you do not have to demand that one be scientificto see, yet its very simplicity is its greatness. It is often said ittakes a great man to see a simple thought, and that it takes a simplemind to see a great thought. Let us be great thinkers and see littlethoughts\u2014think little thoughts and be great thinkers. Here is alittle idea, a simple thought can become capable of seeing it. Isn'tit peculiar then, if we see and are conceited to believe that we dosee, can we say that the world gone by was composed of peoplewho did not think? Did they think? If so, why didn't they thinkthat? The world should have had it; it did exist; has alwaysexisted. That idea is just given a new dress, but the thought, ideaor definite action has existed in the mind of Universal Intelligencefrom time immemorial. It is not new. Universal intelligence knew everything we now know, and then some. We are but interpreting what she has always thought. Letus think of the connection with your Chiropractic education; if youthink the fundamental principles are great, don't think for 173THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC one moment that you are adding to your store of knowledge by studying medicine, chemistry, opthalmology, history, bacteriologyor by studying any other ology of today. If you wish to advancechiropractically, study power through material things, which is the science of electricity. Its principles are true to facts and man. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 DOES IT PAY TO DICTATE TO INNATE? The P. S. C. believes and teaches that Innate has all the power necessary to control and create every function conductive to lifeand health. It is not for man to dictate to her, nor is he able to doso if he wished. It is of frequent occurrence to see tests triedwhere the object was to coax this Innate to do more than she wasable at that time. In every instance, the growth may have beenhastened, but it was at the expense of its quality or size, etc. In agricultural pursuits the results of these experiments are truthfully told. I wish I could say as much for \"the practice of medicine.\" Its deaths, sicknesses and other disasters, following its ruthless guessing, are covered over in the cemetery, where itsvictims are unable to tell the truth. If Innate could be pushed,patients would cease to be sick, nothing but health would prevailwherever the M. D., or other effect treater, has tried his charms.The life that exists in trees, plants and animals is the same externalpower that is converted into mental impulse and becomes that partof us which we could not live without. The following recital of a vegetative test was copied from a recent magazine known for its authoritativeness. If man would butstart the object and leave the rest to this power, minus thedictation, it would produce the best of results, whether in thehuman, beast or plant. If the body is unable to do this, then huntup the cause and adjust it, take away the impingements uponnerves which make them unable to convey this power. This is notdictating to nor assisting Innate in her work; it is but opening that which an accident has closed. By so doing you but let Innate givevent to that which was there, but could not get through. \"One of the latest devices proposed by an expert of the Department of Agriculture for improving the growth of plants andfruits is that of placing them under colored glass, the idea beingthat light of particular hues is especially favorable to vegetation.The expert referred to has recently been experimenting withstrawberry plants grown in hot-houses under glass of differentcolors. His conclusions are interesting. \"Orange-colored glass,\" he says, \"cause the plants to grow more vigorously, but at the expense of the berries, which were bothsmaller and later in developing than when the plants were grownunder ordinary conditions. Under violet-colored glass the plantsyielded a great quantity of fruit, but it was slow in 174ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS ripening, small and of inferior quality. Red, blue and green glass all proved injurious to the growth of the plants. The finest berriesand those which ripened earliest, were grown under plain whiteglass. \"It would appear, then, from these experiments, that light of different colors does have different effects upon vegetation, as hasbeen claimed; but that, as far as strawberries are concerned, all thecolors that sunlight possesses, when united in ordinary day-light,are more effective in the production of good fruit than any singlecolor. \"Of course, it is not the color itself, but the character of the light which gives that color that produces the effect. Every colorof the sunbeam corresponds to light possessing a particularrapidity of vibration and a particular wave length in the ether.Colored glass cuts off some useful rays by absorbing them.\" Color treatment, \"Chromopathy,\" is still used by many pettifoggers to try and coax Innate to show herself, to make hispatient feel better. An illustration: A certain insane hospital hastwo wards. In the first everything is blue, even to the floor beingso painted; the window panes are blue, etc. This is used for thosepatients who are fractious or violent. They soon get despondent, itculls down their actions\u2014\"Get the blues.\" The second ward is afiery, blood red. When a patient has \"the blues\" they put him inhere and that acts to him like a red flag to a bull\u2014it infuriates. Ihave been informed that they have a regular line that have beengoing the rounds, between these two rooms, from the time these wards were started. When \"blue,\" put him in the red room. Thismakes him so wild that he needed \"blueing\" again, and when too\"blue,\" away he went into the \"red\" room. The prospects for hisgetting loose are few and far between. This is but a typicalexample of what coloring will do for the human body. In aiming to assist \"Nature\" it was done at the expense of some other quality of the plant. The same is true of the human body.Stimulate and you have a relapse, deaden and you lose life. TheChiropractor does not dictate to Innate. Does it pay to try and beInnate's master? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 MISNOMERS. \"Misnomer\u2014Any mismeaning of a a wrong or inapplicable name or title.\"\u2014 Webster. The P. S. C. is thoroughly equipped and has the necessaries to prove many terms, now in daily use by therapeutical schools, areinappropriate. Functions, and the physiology of them, were named hundreds of years ago when superstition reigned. \"Recent im- 175THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC provements have been made\"\u2014yes, upon the same basis. The text of this article shall be to tell why a few terms should be strickenfrom all dictionaries pertaining to maintain exactness. Chiropractic is a philosophy. Sciences are but branches. \"Philosophy\u2014the general laws or principles under which all thesubordinate phenomena or facts relating to that subject arecomprehended.\"\u2014 Webster. This concentrated compilation studies the science of power, whence it comes, how converted through the mediums of the mind,mental and brain impulses, in what manner that organ transmitsthem to all tissues of the body, and in what way, when expressed.They perform functions and how each is performed, is accuratework. The nervous system, according to Chiropractic (which isnon-therapeutical and non-superstitious) is distinctly a science,consequently different than any. These facts have beendemonstrated by that unique P. S. C. study, nerve tracing. It proves the existence of a sympathetic nervous system, supplantingit with a direct communicating system, which is definitely provenevery day in The P. S. C. clinic. This is one instance where Chiropractic comprises the \"laws or principles under which all subordinate phenomena arecomprehended.\" Having an instruction of power and through whatmediums and how performed make its details complete frompower to expression, going; and impressions efferently, which inturn cause commands to respond intelligently. \"Sympathetic Nervous System.\" All nerve fibrils have their origin in two brains. From there each has its tissue cell to go to.Each fibril and corresponding impulse has specific functions toperform, which is accomplished by cellular expansion. If eachreceives its impulse direct from the brain and carries itundeviating, without anastomosing, and places it into action atperipheral, where can there be \"sympathy\"? Dunglison says:\"Sympathetic affections of an organ are those morbific phenomena that supervene without any cause.\" Can you imagine an effect without cause? How well known is that phrase, \"The law of Causeand Effect Cause must be a precedent. A scientific knowledge of voluntary Innate functions were never known until the advent ofChiropractic. \"Sympathetic Nervous System\" was the best knownprevious. Now that better supplants, let us willingly drop themisnomer. Where is the person who can scientifically define \"Nervousness?\" I know what the accepted meaning is. When youhave that, what have you? Trembling or not; steady or shaking,they will say, \"I am extremely nervous.\" \"I cannot controlvoluntary functions at the command of the will. My will andphysical don't hitch.\" Why? The educated brain is a reservestation for impulses which can be utilized at command. If thereexists an osseous obstruction so that impulses cannot be deliveredto point of expression, we are \"Nervous.\" I prefer the terms General 176ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS or Local Incoordination. This term expresses intelligence, a thought deep in character. \"Nervous; Strong, also Weak, irritable,excitable.\"\u2014 Webster. You may have moderate incoordination. If so, \"weak\" nervousness. If there be great incoordination, \"strong\"nervousness. The latter word can aid and is stretched to mean anything, because it involves no definite function. It is another superstitious misnomer, although a useful words to use when theM. D. or D. O. does not comprehend the cause of incoordination. \"Coordinate\u2014to give common action or condition to; to regulate and combine so as to produce harmonious action.\" \u2014 Webster. It will be quickly seen that any inharmony, slight or great, is incoordination, which signifies that it is not based on\"perhaps, guess so, may be, I think so, we will try and see,\"unstable foundations. \"Nerve Pain\" and \"Neuralgia.\" Nerves are mediums that carry impulses outward and impressions inward. When expressedperipherally they are functions. Impressions are conveyed inwardby afferent nerves. When each impression reaches the brain it isinterpreted as pain, taste or smell, good, bad or indifferent, inaccordance with its sense; where and how fibrils received theirimpressions. If the reader comprehends fundamental principles ofChiropractic, philosophically, he will know that pain is onlyrecognized at the brain, although knowledge of its location, thatwhich makes the abnormal impressions, must be at periphery. \"Pain\" is a term vaguely understood by preceding schools. Ask aphysician or Osteopath \"What is pain?\" and see how bungling willbe the answer. Pain exists as an interpretation of externalabnormal conditions, a warrant to correct the incoordination. Ifefferent nerves were carrying full quota of mental impulses, andcould express themselves, without interference, \"pain\" would bean unknown quantity. \"Neuralgia,\" \"Tic Douloureau\" and manylike names are misnomers; trying to tell something which does notexist. Why use them? Ask a 1908 P. S. C. student \"What is pain?\" He would reply, \"It is the mental acknowledgment of an efferentmental interference that needs adjusting.\" \"Neuritis\u2014inflammation of a nerve.\"\u2014 Dunglison. \"Inflammation\" exists only in that tissue in close proximity to the nerve periphery. Excessive heat does not exist within the nerveitself unless other nerve fibrils, those that convey calorificfunctions to its sheaths or substances, is intensified. One lobe ofInnate brain has the output of those impulses which, whenexpressed at peripheral, are calorific. The nerve itself is not \"acalorific nerve,\" but conveys impulses of that character. Nervescan be inflamed only when these impulses are stimulated by a slight impingement upon them somewhere at the spinal column. Inthe common acceptation of the word \"inflammation of the nerves\"is a misnomer. 177THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC \"Neurasthenia.\" A term and condition not understood by M.D.'s, D.O.'s or anybody else. When a patient is more or lessrun down and they can do nothing to correct it, they tell thepatient, \"You have neurasthenia, nervous prostration. Yourgeneral nervous system is run down and this is incurable.\" Ignorantconsolation. If they but knew that Innate, the power behind thethrone, is unlimited, and if given half normal opportunities toexpress herself through brain and nerves, the patient would rapidlyreach normal, they would never use such death hinting terms again.Beyond \"Nature,\" which is also above the M. D.'s and D.O.'scomprehension, they know but little, if anything, about this power,so cannot take it into confidence. The physical is all to them. It isthis which is diseased, therefore that which must be treated. Theydo not know, and as a body, fight progression, therefore do notwant to know the cause which is making a short circuit betweenthe seat of power, brain and its expression, through the physical.The above, to one knowing better, is as meaningless as a boy sentto catch babbling echoes. Any physical will run down, that is,deplete itself if it cannot get enough mental impulses to maintainthe physique. The incoordinated body is the one unable to getimpulses through the occluded intervertebral foramina. What isthe thing to do? Let the patient go unaided by calling the diseasesome name that is as vague as the cause of disease is to him who istreating it, or have a knowledge so complete and systematized thatthe cause can be quickly and accurately located, and then adjust itreturning the body to normal? Which? \"Neuropathy,\" \"Neurapathological.\" Terms used to denote some diseased condition which has never been definitely locatednor its symptoms defined. In every instance, so named by the M.D. and D. O., I have no trouble to quickly prove that it had definitetissues involved, specifically located. Nerves are placed on a parwith other tissues. According to \"regulars,\" the superiorimportance of the nerves conveying mental impulses overeverything else, is not recognized; every tissue in the body issubject to its commands, which output is controlled and regulatedby the brain. Harmony would exist, in all tissues, if these werenormal and uninterrupted. The above named diseases aredefinitions given for combinations of expressions, in which nervesubstance is not involved and never agree in two people alike,caused by lack of incoordination between the source of power andits expression. They are limitations to nothing, imitations ofsomething as yet unknown. Impulse\u2014Indicative of power, which could not exist if not expressed. Impression\u2014Inculcation received from without. Touch, sight, hearing, smell, taste, direction, etc., make imprints at peripheralafferent nerve fibres. Power is used where function, coming from the brain, is expressed. I know of no physical function necessary to main- 178ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS tain life, but is controlled by impulse, followed by molecular motion. Protoplasmic movements are put into effect by mentalimpulses\u2014energy promoters\u2014making fundamental action anecessity and simple. The mental knowledge of physical conditions is received by impressions in the brain, and there interpreted according to qualityand quantity. Strength is not necessary to have vibration; it is theresponse which designates force, and vibration is the sequence. Physiologies teach that everything passing towards or from \"centers,\" through nerves are impulses. Chiropractors make a distinction between the outgoing and vice versa. By the term \"Nerve Impulse\" is commonly understood a vague something which passes through nerves. Whence, where it comesfrom, goes to or does, is little understood by medical orOsteopathic schools. They teach that impulses go to and start fromplexuses, nerve centers and division of the spinal cord. Beyondthis is deep water and for fear of drowning, refuse to get their feetwet. Thus The P. S. C. had no precedent to follow, its foundation was new\u2014its superstructure demanded materials accordingly. The brain is the center of all nerve fibres, hence all that which passes outward through and uses the nerves as a conveyor ismental impulse\u2014nerve impulse being misnamed. The nerve doesnot make, but acts in the capacity of a carrier\u2014transmitter.Impulses must be named according to the place of origin, the sameas the material secretions, viz.: Pancreatic juice or Splenic Fluid. Mental impulse adds another term, with a broader meaning to The P. S. C. nomenclature, and will supplant nerve impulse which will not be known except as another superstition, misnomer. Howlong will it take Osteopaths to copy this idea? Watch theirliterature. Mental Impulse is that power which leaves the brain en route for the various stations throughout the body. Mental impressionsare all those vibrations en route for the brain. The distinction exists between direction, as the two are not counterparts inquantity, quality or speed, therefore, the above classification. What is in a name? They are and have been used for thousands of years by medical men who know nothing of the cause ofdisease. Look at the combined colossal knowledge and thethousands of treatments of all schools, including Osteopathy, andwhat have we? Chaos! Chiropractic supplants this endlesssquabble over detail, with a knowledge of cause, immaterial ofcombinations that may ensue. Forget the combinations, forgetnames and still the Chiropractor is safe, for he knows cause. Why name effects? While you are tampering with and treating those,the Chiropractor will rush in, adjust cause, and get all credit forhaving returned coordination. It will be quickly seen 179THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC that he who has a specific cause of disease and a thorough knowledge of how to adjust it, will, in the future, be the man of thehour. Therapeutical writers (including Osteopaths) refer to \"phenomena\" of physical functions. Why? They are unusual,strange or unaccountable. The knowledge of the whys andwherefores is absent; trying to grasp sunbeams at the wrong end.Without intelligent acquirements of Innate energy manifested bymental impulse, required to make functions possible. I can readilysee how and why such continues to be \"phenomena.\" The Philosophy of Chiropractic covers all points so thoroughly that they cease to exist under that name, for a specific, pure andunadulterated Chiropractor accounts for each and every action,explaining the physiology of each move or step from birth todeath; a thing no collection of sciences, under one common head,previous to this, has accomplished. Simplify, do not mystify, is exemplified in all P. S. C. teachings. We have succeeded in building a philosophical mansion, huge in proportions, grand in external appearances andwith all, simplified grandeur in detail. We can say withoutcontradiction that P. S. C. Chiropractic supersedes and is setting a new pace. By studying some of the ideas embraced the reader willslightly grasp the greatness of The Philosophy of Chiropractic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 THERAPEUTICS IS OF SUPERSTITIOUS ORIGIN. It originated in a misdirected, unenlightened, religious feeling; a belief in magic, charms, omens and prognostics; because of alack of acquaintance with Nature's laws. It embraces an excessivereverence for, or fear of, that which is unknown or mysterious; theorigin and curing of diseases attributed to necromancy, the blackart; they were thought to be controlled by an invisible intelligenceoutside of the afflicted, therefore, conjurers learned to practice themagic art which, in a modified form, is continued by practitionersof medicine; instead of alchemy and conjurers, injury bywitchcraft, curing diseases by the assistance of supernaturalbeings; we have chemists and physicians, treating diseases fromoutside influence, a mastery of secret forces, already existing. As to what is, and is not thought to be superstitious, depends wholly upon one's method of reasoning, which is moulded byeducation. That which appears reasonable or superstitious to onemay not seem so to another. Possibly none of us are entirely freeof it, although it is easy to observe in others. There is no line of education that is so permeated with superstition as that of curing diseases. The words \"cure and heal,\"so strenuously guarded by medical men, are of superstition,rightfully belong to them, and should not be used by Chiropractors. 180ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Some states make it a crime for doctors to make use of them unless licensed to do so. \"To cure or heal\" is not Chiropractic. The curing of disease and the healing of wounds have always been done by magic. Thisassistance was, and is, supposed to come from supernatural beings,or a mastery of secret forces inherent in the agent or means used;known as sorcery, witchcraft, necromancy, conjuration,enchantment and incantations. My mother was as full of reverence for the unknown mysterious agent of superior power as an egg is of meat. She, ofcourse, did not see it thus. No one thinks themselves superstitious.She could sit for hours relating incidents which occurred in herchildhood of persons who were bewitched, informing us how thedoctor broke the spell by incantations. On one occasion the M. D.directed them to make a representation of the suspicioned witchout of dough, which he ordered burned in the fireplace. She wouldbecome animated with relating what a time they had keeping theimage in the fire, which would crack and snap, throwing the doughout of the flames and on the hearth. They finally succeeded inholding it until burned, which broke the spell, relieving the girl ofher affliction. This is one of many which was conscientiouslybelieved in and told by her. That was near a century ago. Manyreaders will be reminded of similar tales of witchcraft. While mostM. D.'s have outgrown this depth of superstition, they find muchof it among those whom they are called to visit. Some persons may question my statement in regard to M. D.'s believing in magic, the power of some to put a spell, which wename disease, upon others; in charms to cure; inherent power ofremedial agents; amulets as guards against evil; the ability a fewpossess of throwing off the ascendancy gained by sorcery orwitchcraft. I shall quote a few words from medical books, asillustrative and proof of the above. Where superstition ends andreason is fully enthroned, depends upon the education of theindividual doing the thinking. Before I get through I expect toshow that all remedies for the treatment of effects are ofsuperstitious origin. I am not discussing the efficacy nor doubting the honesty of those who believe in remedies, regardless of their depth in sorcery;they frequently give relief, even to curing the afflicted. Remediesof every description for any purpose whatever are but woof-fillingfor witchcraft\u2014warp; they are different patterns of cloth when inthe same loom of superstition. Charms among the laity are incommon use today; very often they are given the credit of curing atthe disadvantage of the attending M. D. I desire to draw thedistinguishing line between Nature and superstition, cause andeffect, adjusting and treating. For King's Evil, commonly known as scrofula. \"Doctress Anne Pounsbery, who departed this life December 11, 1813, aged 181THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC seventy-three years,\" prescribed, \"Take the legs of a toad. Bake and grind them to powder with pestle and mortar. Place thepowder in a bag around the neck of the sufferer.\" I presume thatrelief and failure followed this prescription, as much so as manyremedies used today. From \"The New London Difpenfatory, by William Profeffor of MDCCXVI; I quote: \"Tranflated intoEnglish for the Publick good, and fitted to the whole Art ofHealing.\" The reader will have to replace many f's by an s, for Iwill copy as printed 200 years ago.

D.,Professor of Physics, thought it was all right, for he says, it wasone of \"His Choice and Select Recipes.\" Dr. Salmon held Dr. Batein high esteem, as evidenced by the first paragraph of the preface,which says, \"The original author of this book was the Eminent andLearned Dr. Bate, a Man who in his Station has been Phyfician toTwo Kings of England, and a Protector; and fuch Approved Skillin his Profeffion that to make any Descants thereon, would be todraw a Vail over his Luftre, and blemifh that Excellency, which inthis following Work, gives a convincing Proof, that he was one ofthe greateft Mafters of his Art in the Univerfe.\" 182ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS This prescription is prefaced by the medical character \"R\" still used by all medical men of every school, when writingprescriptions or formulas for making combinations, or mixtures ofmaterials to be used as medicine. Webster says of this sign: \"Thischaracter is reputed to have been originally the symbol of Jupiter,it was placed at the top of a formula to propitiate the king of gods,that the compound might act favorably.\" Dunglison's Dictionary ofMedical Science and Dictionary of Medicines states: \"Originally itwas the sign of Jupiter, and was placed at the top of a formula topropitiate the king of the gods, that the compound might actfavorably.\" This insignia of witchcraft is yet used by all themedical fraternity. It is peculiar that this sign or superstition is souniversally used by Physicians in prefacing their prescriptions.They actually implore Jupiter, the king of gods, to make this, theirremedy, act favorably for a certain ailment, just think of physicianspraying to Jupiter to bless their practice. Dr. Bate appropriately names this compound \"The Sympathetic Ointment.\" It is composed of \"Oil Man'sGreafe, Mofs of a Man's Skull, Kill'd by a violent death. MummyMan's blood, mix and make an Ointment, S. A.\" In this and othermixtures, where a part or the whole of a human is used asmedicine\u2014they are always of a man, he being preferred to awoman, for the reason the man is stronger, therefore, would makethe most powerful medicine. Observe that this prescription isappended with \"S. A.,\" which means, \"According to Art.\" Itrequired a systematic knowledge and skill to compound, calcinate,dissolve, infuse, separate, extract, triturate, sublimate, ferment,fixate, imbibe, abstract, and distil men, beasts, birds, fish, snakes,worms, insects, minerals, herbs, fruits, seeds and gums so that theirJupiter god would be pleased to favor the preparation and make itsuitable as a remedy; it was the business of an educated licensedapothecary, pharmaceutical chemist, to prepare these mixtures sothat they might be efficacious. Dr. Bate tells us how to use this \"Sympathetic Ointment.\" He says, \"By this Ointment all wounds are healed; anointing theInftrument by which the Wound was made, once a day, every day,if the Wound be great, otherwife, if the Wound be fmall, onceevery fecond or third day may fuffice. The Weapon is to be keptwrapt up in a clean Linnen Cloth, and in a place not too hot, leftthe Patient fuffers thereby.\" Not only different portions, but often the whole body of a human was used for medicine. From pages 173 to 174 of \"TheNew London Difpenfatory,\" I quote two recipes out of the many.\"Take the carcafe of a young man (fome fay red hair'd), not dyingof a defeafe, but killed; let it lie 24 Hours in clear Water in the Air,cut the flefh in pieces, to which add pouder of Myrrh, and a littleAloes; Imbibe it 24 Hours in the Spirit of Wine and Turpentine,take it out, bang it up twelve Hours in frefh Spirit, 183THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC then hang up the pieces in a dry Air, and a shady place, fo will they dry and not ftink.\" \"Aqua Divina, Divine Water. Take the whole Carcafe of a Man violently killed with the Intrails, cut in pieces and mix them; diftilit from a Retort twice or thrice. It is reported to have a magicpower.\" \"Violently killed.\" It would not do to take one who had perished by disease, for fear of contagion : but on the contrary, aman who had died, well, stout, and hearty, would bestow healthupon those who used the decoctions, magisteries, elixirs, infusions,triturations, extracts, powders and tinctures made from thedeceased, and used as medicine. Such was and is GrandfatherAllopath. Diseases were cured by remedial means, which were supposed to subdue, or remove the intruder. Witchcraft was used, amuletsworn, and compounds made of every conceivable substance for thepurpose of warding off and treating evil effects, which wereproduced by some outside influence. M. D.'s, then and now,recognize effects put on, or in, by something extrinsic of man,therefore, know nothing in regard to adjusting displacements,which cause maladies, or to use a scriptural term, afflictions.When will they learn from Nature, and find the cause of ailmentsin the one affected? On page 199 of Dr. William Salmon's wonderful collection of recipes, I find \"King-fifher. Flefh roafted and eaten is affirmed byfome to help fuch as we are poffeffed. The Heart dried and hungabout the Neck of a Child cures the Spilepfy.\" Page 194. \"Skink (akind of crocodile). In India it is ufed againft Elephantiafis. TheHeart is worn in Black Wool, as an Amulet, againft Quartans.\"Please notice, that the skink is used against thickening of the skinand tissue; also against fevers. No doubt, the thickened fissuredhide of the crocodile caused them to think of it as a remedy forthicqened cuticles. It will be observed that many remedies werereasoned out thus. M. D.'s of all ages have used agents againstany and all ailments. The disease maker's fraud, poisoning wellpeople by vaccine virus, in order to, as Samuel Frederick Gray,Lecturer on Materia Medica, Pharmaceutical Chemist, puts it in histreatise on Pharmacology, date 1824, \"Used to communicate thedisease under favorable circumstances instead of hazarding itsbeing acquired when circumstances are unfavorable.\" Here diseaseis used as a remedy against taking smallpox when unfavorable.This delusive scheme has put millions of dollars of revenue in thecoffers of the tariff protectionists. Those who prescribed amuletsdid so to guard against evils, which included diseases. Page 205. \"The Blackbird. The Head with the Feet of an Hare, are ufed as an Amulet to make men bold and courageous.\" Page208. \"The Houpe. The eye worn as an Amulet, cures Leprofy.\"Page 211. \"Dog-fifh.

There are Males andFemales. It comforts and good Colour, and refifts Melancholy andWitchcraft. Applied to the Pulfes it cures Agues.\" Cures were not the result of adjustments, but of a magic force. They were thought miraculous and not natural. The M. D. today,outside of surgery, looks upon the results of remedies as wonderfuland the change as hyperphysical. Take notice that the fancied male and female inherent intelligence in the above stones had the ability of expelling evils ordiseases and resisting witchcraft. The same principle guides thephysician in selecting his remedial agents to overcome disorders;fearing that he may forget to ask his god Jupiter to bless thepreparation, he has the symbol \"R\" printed at the left hand uppercorner of his prescription blank. Remedies are thought to have thepower of dissolving, removing, drawing, prevailing, expelling,resisting, cooling, heating, strengthening, or weakening; in fact,they are anticipated to act on and do for the afflicted as the doctorand Jupiter may direct. It is no wonder that the I medicalprofession believe in suggestion and advocate it as an essential par,of their treatment. If dentists were as anxious for specifics they could find some highly recommended among Dr. Salmon's prescriptions. On page;177, 181, 213, 223, 14 and 234 I quote: \"The Ram. The Brainmixed with Honey, and annointed on Gums, caufes Children tobreed their Teeth eafily.\" \"A Horfe The Teeth which arefirft saft (as an Amulet) help Children to breed their Teeth, and theToothach.\" \"Sea Dragon. The Bones Cure the Tooth-ach \"The Neuet. The makes Teeth out with- 185THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC out Pain.\" \"Otter or Beaver.

The Afhes glue togetherbroken Bones, and draw things out of the Flefh; are good againftthe Bitings of Serpents and Scorpions; put into a hollow Tooth,they cure the Tooth-ache.\" Dr. Salmon refers to an aching tooth because of its being hollow and decayed. Such is not the cause. The teeth of somepersons decay, even to the gums, without an ache. Dentists knowthat sound teeth often ache. It remained for a Chiropractor todemonstrate that all sensations, including toothache, were innerves, made so because of impingement on the maxillary branchof the \"fifth cranial nerve.\" Cervical vertebrae displaced, occludeforamina, the outgrowing nerves, causing pain. Why notreplace the vertebra, remove the pressure, free the nerve, andrestore it to its normal condition? M. D.'s have always been anxious to possess a specific; as Dunglison puts it, \" A remedial agent to which is attributed the special property of removing some particular disease; examples are mercury in syphilis and quinine in malaria.\" The M. D.'s of200 years ago had many remedies, thousands of them, which werespecific; they have culled, until now they have less than a dozen.As they advance toward Nature and away from a belief in thesuperior magical powers of remedial agents, grow in knowledge,free themselves of superstition, they continue to drop those whichwere believed to possess inherent intrinsic value, an antipathy forcertain ailments. The belief that the sick are possessed of evil,bewitched by some sorcerer, hoodooed by bad luck, is disbelievedin proportion as we accept Nature's laws. The physician of todaywho studies Nature more and remedies less, will seek to adjustcauses and discontinue to treat effects. Marvelous qualities have always been attributed to finger rings. Their power derived from mystic words, cabalistic devices, or theirsettings. Some were believed to be medicinal and used to heal theills of mankind. Those blessed by Royal Majesties were given thecredit of curing epilepsy and the cramp. The touch of kings curedscrofula. I have as good reason to believe that one agent contained as much healing power (charm virtue) as another. Everythingimaginable has been by some held sacred or unholy, and thought toomen good or bad luck for the possessor. The following formulas contain a few of the \"remedial agents to which is attributed the special property of removing someparticular disease.\" \"Bate's Difpenfatory.\" Date 1694. Page 13. \"Water of the larger Pifmires (gathered in May or June); 186ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENT Honey: Spring-Water: mix and diftil according to Art. Dofe one fpoonful. It provokes vomiting, and cures Tertian Agues.\" Medicalremedies given internal or external, are for the purpose of\"provoking\" vomiting, purging; to drive a rash in or out; to dry arunning sore or to provoke it to discharging freely; to irritate oneportion in order to draw the inflammation (heat) from another. Theprinciple of inherent witchcraft is believed to exist in, or istransmuted to the agent used so that it acts \"Live. Swallows, number Dunglison says: Castoreum is a \"Peculiar concrete matter found in follicles between the anus and the external genitals of the beaverin both sexes; the odor is strong, unpleasant, and peculiar, tastebitter, sub-acid; antispasmodic and nervine.\" The medicalpractitioners are leaving out many of the most obnoxiousingredients used by their forerunners; those retained are believedto contain some virtue as a curative agent. The witchcraft principle of two centuries ago, and that of today, are the samewhen prescribing and compounding drugs; they are presumed to berestorative and life-giving; or counteracting, prevailing dispellingand driving out the intruder, or evil effects. \"Samuel Frederick Gray, lecturer on the Materia Medica; Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Botany,\" issued the third edition onPharmacology. Date 1824. It contains hundreds of remedies, manyof which are specifics, of which I will copy three. Page 242.\"Tabasheer. A stony concretion formed in the joints of the bamboocane. Used in diseases arising from obstructions.\" Webster says:\"This silica is highly valued in the East Indies as a medicine forthe use of bilious vomitings, bloody flux, piles and various otherdiseases.\" Some thinker observed this concretion in the obstructedjoint of the cane, therefore reasoned along the line of superstitionthat it ought to be good for impediments in the human body. Samepage. \"Calculus Humanus. Used in obstructions, and in preventingthe growth of calculi.\" The same mode of thinking, although a stepin advance of witchcraft, yet born of superstition. This moloch fanaticism has used the blood, fat, dung and urine of almost every known creature, to rid sufferers of maladies. Itsdevotees always had their peculiar reasons for so doing.Remember that methods of consideration depend on educationaltraining. That which appears rational to one may not seem so toanother. Remedies, like fashions, are always changing, yet a few ofthe many remedial agents, which were thought to have some Innatevirtue hidden in their precious substances, are retained. In Holy Writ we read, \"The life of all flesh is the blood.\" Preparations made of blood are believed to give life. Only a fewyears ago, there was a craze for blood drinking. Consump- 187THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC tives were eagerly swallowing large quantities of the flesh warm blood of slaughtered cattle. The medical profession used it in manyof their compounds. These pharmaceutical mixtures are suppliedfrom extensive manufactories; one of which is located in NewYork. Their advertisement reads like the magisterial beliefs of twohundred years ago. Let us read one. \"Oppose Disease with the very power that will prevent or overcome it\u2014live blood. \"Bovinine is the life arterial blood of the sturdy bullock. It is antiseptically prepared by cold process, and sterilized. It makesnew and enriched blood quicker and better than any other knownagent. It is Nature's Greatest Auxiliary, and a most efficient aid toany form of medication. \"Use it in Anemia, Consumption, Dyspepsia, and all debilitated and impoverished conditions. Use it topically on chronic ulcers,lupus, fistula, burns, and bed sores. Use it in obstetrical practice,and note magical and healthy healing, and prompt abolishment ofpus, stench and pain.\" The above, located at 75 W. Houston Street, New York has all the ear-marks of remedies in vogue two hundred years ago. Oppose disease with power that will overcome it. Thus has the medical profession always reasoned and boasted of their battles withdisease. How different when disabilities are viewed from naturalmethods of adjusting causes, instead of superstitiously treatingeffects with remedies. All functions are performed by nerves; theyare the life of the body, to heat the body is one of their acts.Anemia, consumption and dyspepsia are abnormal conditions,because of functions improperly performed. If nerves are free toact natural, then all duties are executed properly in normal amount.Nerve impingement is the cause of functions being abnormallyaccomplished, either in too great a degree of a lack of. Nerveaction can only be interfered with by impingement. Pressure cansolely be brot to bear upon nerves by hard tissue of bones, and only at joints between the articulating surfaces. If bones areslightly displaced, their articulating surfaces luxated, nerves arepinched, their action deranged thereby. If so, why not replace thedisplaced bones and free the nerves? Why try to overcome diseaseby opposing it with the power of dead blood? Ulcers, lupus, fistula, and bed sores are results of abnormal nerve action. Why not adjust the displaced parts of the skeletalframe and allow the nerves to perform their work without hin-drance ? Who can tell the difference in quality or value, as a remedy of arterial and venous blood? Does not one contain as muchnutriment as the other? The nutrition assimilated is all there is ofit. The human economy cannot assimilate any more nutriment outof the blood than there is food in it. Observe that this blood is fromthe \"sturdy bullock;\" that from steers and 188ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENT cows would be considered inferior, because of less strength. This is a continuation of the same superstitional medical reasoning ofcenturies ago, when Dr. William Salmon said, \"The Water comingout of the Mouth of the Stone Horse after drinking, will cureBarrenefs, if often drunk.\" \"Note magical healing.\" These manufacturers know how to cater to the M. D.'s who are looking after chemical combinations,which contain magical hidden wisdom, and act in a miraculous manner. This includes the imagined mastery of secret forces,which superstitious remedies are said to contain. Chemists arebelieved to be masters of the transmutation art. \"Abolishment.\"What a magic force dead blood is thot to have put an end to, wipeout, do wholly away with pain and dead matter\u2014pus. Surprising,wonderful, that people of this enlightened age will use such stuff. Any portion of an animal or vegetable, when eaten, contains only the nutriment we are able to absorb and assimilate bydigestion. That the consumption of muscles would give muscularstrength; the eating of brains, intelligence; blood, animation andcolor to our skin; dung, good digestion, because of its beingdigested; would not be worth noticing, were it not that suchreasoning has been always that of the medical profession. The above advertisement, copied from Medical Progress (?) of July, 1901, shows the conjectured mastery of hidden secret forces(superstition) which all remedies are said to contain. It gives thedistinguishing marks of identification of its origin, viz: witchcraft,conjuration, sorcery, necromancy and incantations. From the foregoing quotations, it might be thot that amulets were always connected with all medical recipes. Such is not thecase, altho there may be more benefit from the always presentassured confidences given by continued suggestion of the charmagainst evil, than in the nutritive quality of the drug or mixture, aswill be seen from the following, although of the same fanaticalsource: Page 209. \"The Eel.

Their great trouble lies in \"knowing so many thingsthat ain't so.\" Chiropractic has dumped all branches of \"medicalscience\" overboard, for it is worse than useless to try to advance itby the usual method of substituting new remedies. The science ofChiropractic is thot incongruous by physicians who give remediesto carry off disease by physic. Webster says of \"Heal. To remove or subdue; to cause to pass away; to cure; said of a disease or wound.\" Before the advent ofChiropractic all methods were therapeutical. They advocated forcefor the subduing and removal of the intruder; as tho disease was anintelligent evil. The most obnoxious materials have, therefore,been selected. Iodoform blunts the sensibility of the peripheralnerve terminations, relieves pain\u2014treatment of effects, instead ofadjusting the cause. By its disgusting odor it advertises the doctor,to the disadvantage of the patient and those within smellingdistance, for rods around and hours after their absence. Asafetida;Devils dung; food of the gods; was prescribed as an amulet, hungabout the neck, by doctors forty years ago to ward off disease; it isnow in common use among the lower laity. Sorcery and witchcraft; cure and heal; are two pairs of twins born of superstition. Two hundred years ago medical men believedin the former; today they have replaced them by the latter. Theywere born of the same parents, therefore belong to the samefamily, whom they resemble. The Chicago chemist, who makes animal therapy, solutions and extracts, of seven parts, or organs, of goats and bulls, to cure lessthan a dozen diseases, is not in it, when compared with the chemistof 1716, who was able to utilize thirty-four different portions ofthose two animals, and make formulas to cure ninety-six diseases.The Chicago advertisement says that his animal therapy is \"veryefficient in the treatment of tuberculosis, chronic suppuration,ulceration, etc.\" The ancient chemist affirms, \"The milk being longand largely taken every Day, it certainly cures Confumption. TheExtract of Cows-Dung is good againft all Difeafes; inasmuch thatfcarcely any Difeafe is able to stand before it, being continuallyufed as a diet.\" Excuse me, I would prefer Chiropractic ad-justments. On page 179, Dr. Salmon gives his reason for using dung. He says, \"It is of a cleanfing Faculty, temperate in Quality, and a greatanodyne, and ufed by a very good Lady succefffully, againft theGout, and the cure of all other difeafes. The reafon is 192ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS apparent from the parts of which it is composed; being digefted by an exact natural (animal) heat.\" Charms of all curative agents are founded upon a religious belief, they are supposed to contain magical power which restoresthose afflicted by the devil, or evil beings, back to health, as willbe seen from the following, copied from Dunglison's Dictionary ofMedical foot! is fast asleep!Thumb ! thumb ! thumb ! in spittle we steep;Crosses three we make to ease us,Two for the thieves, and one for Christ Jesus.\" \"For cramp in the leg.

(Pepys,.) There came three angels out of the East;The one brought fire, the other brought frost.Out fire; in frost.In the name of the Father and Son and holy Ghost. Amen.\" Another form of charm is given on page 21 of this same book. \"ABRACADABRA, the name of a Syrian idol, according to Selden.

The reader may take time to diseases for which they are used. Chemistry was born of superstition, being an outgrowth of alchemy, an imaginary art which aimed to find the panacea, auniversal remedy for disease. Alchemists assumed the miraculouspower of transmutation; they led the way to modern chemistry.Medical science is science in superstition. Ancient chemists were believed to change the nature and character of the material they handle, by transmutation, placingtherein a miraculous power of resisting evil and dispelling ail-ments. The medical practice is permeated with superstition. Howcan it be otherwise? Health boards are continually boasting of theirfights with disease. Osteopathic literature abounds with\"Overcoming Disease.\" \"Disease is an enemy, we have to combatit.\" \"We need military schools; other schools have failed to batterdown and take the forts of the enemy.\" \"We came off the battleground victorious.\" How can it be otherwise ? \"Baron van Swieten, confellor and Firft Phyfician Emperor Emprefs of Germany; PerpetualPrefident of the College of Phyficians in Vienna; in a workpublished in 1776, \"Concerning the Knowledge and cure ofDifeafes,\" gives an explanation of pleurisy. On page 28, he says,\"The reafon is evident; for the blood of a healthy perfon, drawnfrom a healthy vein into cold water, inftantly threadsof almoft folid confiftence.\" On has for itscaufe, everything that is difpofed to generate an inflammation ofanother kind.\" Page 162. \"Moreover, it will hereafter be made toappear that violent commotions of the mind produce an atrabiliarytemperature of humors, which was lately in the prefent aphorifmreckoned amongft the caufes of an hepatitis.

Van Helmont was born at Brussels, Germany, in 1577. He was an eminent chemist and surgeon; believed in the mag- 194ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS netic cure of wounds; placed the seat of the soul in the stomach \"because when we hear bad news we lose our appetite.\" He was astudent of Paracelsus, whose father was a physician and chemist;was born near Zurich, Switzerland, in l493. He held that disease had an actual existence, and did not depend upon an excess, or a deficiency of bile, phlegm, or blood. He was professor of physicand surgery at Basel, and prescribed for all the great men of hisday. He traveled in Asia and Africa, making cures by necromancy,divination and conjuration, which he claimed were specifics forcertain diseases. He experimented in chemistry, on the medicinalvirtues of metals, desiring to discover the philosopher's stone. These eminent physicians were the predecessors of our present doctors of medicine. The former, as well as the latter believed theirremedies contained an inherent antipathy for certain diseases. Using remedies to treat effects, named disease, whether by sorcery, drugs, manipulations, mental or physical, magnetic, or anyother means, the agent employed is expected to impart some forcethat will overcome and make conditions unfavorable for the evil tocontinue to inhabit the human body. The object and principleinvolved in each method born of superstition which aims totransmute the nature of any substance into a remedy, is just thesame. Exorcism includes several kinds of superstitious fabrics woven upon the same loom. An exorciser is one who claims to stand in with the powers that control human ailments. Unseen forces are thot to haunt our dwellings, afflict humanity and animals. For what purpose, and whether from a good or badsource, depends upon thon's education. Some think that the GoodLord afflicts a member of their family for thon's benefit, or someone of the household. The purpose may be to humble one or more,to restrain them from evil ways, or to bring back to the fold,embraced in their peculiar ideas, some erring soul. Others do notblame the Almighty, but the devil for their misfortunes anddisabilities. An exorcist uses thon's influence to appease the Lord; or by force cast out evil spirits or devils that torment the afflicted. Thisis done by conjuration, using a holy name in the form of a charm,faith cure, or Christian Science. The mental healer, no matter by what name known, asserts that all diseased conditions are mental illusions superinduced by someoutward evil influence. Exorcism is the act of warding off or casting out evil, removing mental or physical ailments from one who is possessed, byinvoking supernatural aid, or in the use of words used in a magicalform, or by performing certain ceremonies; this is odiously namednecromancy; popularly known as faith cure, or 195THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Christian Science. To deliver from, or to purify one of evil influence, is to make thon immune and protected from all harm. In order that the reader may more fully comprehend the difference between superstitions, using remedies to treat effects;and Chiropractic, the adjusting of causes; cure and heal, andreplacing displaced parts of the skeletal frame in proper relation toeach other, so that nerves may perform their functions in a naturalmanner; I will relate one case. C. H. Murphy, of Davenport, was brot in our office, by J. S. Evans, D.D.S. Mr. Murphy was suffering with sciatic rheumatism,so much so that he walked with the greatest difficulty and muchdistress. I gave him one adjustment, replacing a lumbar vertebra,which took the pressure from the nerve giving instant relief. Hisfacial expression changed from that showing great distress to oneof happiness. He was not backward in telling his friends what I haddone for him. He had by some means wrenched his spine, slightlydisplaced a vertebra, partially closing the foramen, which pinchedthe nerve as it passed thru the vertebral opening. The natural thingto do was to replace the slightly displaced vertebra, thereby freeingthe nerve from impingement. That was \"The morbid anatomy and etiology of rheumatism remain doubtful. The causes commonly ascribed arethe presence of lactic acid, uric acid, or excess of fibrin in theblood, cold and microorganisms.\" These presumed causes are buteffects of malnutrition, functions abnormally performed. Remedies used for rheumatism are innumerable, one about as good as another, if not better. They are prescribed for the treatmentof effects, whether it be a buckeye or potato carried in the pocketof the \"afflicted,\" medical, magnetic, mental, baths, electricity, orosteopathy. The originator of the latter says on page l30 of hisbook on that science \"Rheumatism is caused by gas exhaustionfrom the joints, electric heat and friction following.\" Wherein isthere any resemblance between Osteopathy and Chiropractic? One hundred years hence, remedies will not be used in general; causes will be adjusted instead. Chiropractors look upon all vertebrate animals as sensitive nerve machines. Innate intelligence performs all the functions ofthe body, in man or beast, by and thru nerves, whether normal orabnormal, or in what degree. If nerves are free to act in a naturalmanner, then we have health. Superstition places drugs in the feedboxes of horses, and the drinking water of fowls to ward offdisease. Chiropractors adjust causes, all other methods treat effects. Causes can only be adjusted; effects can only be treated. Wecannot treat causes, nor adjust effects. By adjusting the bony framework, which supports the soft parts of a vertebrate animal, whether man, beast or bird, we 196ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS put to right any displaced joint, the only possible place where nerves can be impinged. Doing this is no more treating than itwould be to replace the displaced parts of a watch or engine. Chiropractic claims no kin to any of the methods which treat effects, nor does it need their assistance. Chiropractic has grown by its own expansion. It has opened new fields for investigation. The progress already made is but thebeginning of greater achievements. The discovery of the principlesunderlying this science will put a keener edge to the discontent ofsuperstitious methods; conditions which can easily be bettered. Itmay bring revolutionary agitation and imprisonment, but wisdomwill keep pace with knowledge and the intellectual development ofthis, the grandest and greatest discovery ever made for thebetterment of mankind. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY AND ITS COUNTERFEIT \"MODERNIZED CHIROPRACTIC.\" To know what the above subjects are it is necessary to show the resemblance of one to the other. I shall quote the authorities uponOrthopedical Surgery in The P. S. C. library and close with the assimilie. I shall prove that the attempted \"Modernizing\" ofChiropractic was simply adding that which has existed as a distinctscience for hundreds of years. Instead of advancing its interests,they have retraced into the medical path that which Chiropractic isfighting to shed. Instead of adding new ideas, they have retrograded. Each author will be taken singly, giving those parts which bear upon these questions. Bear in mind following questions in readingeach: What is Orthopedic Surgery?How old is it?Is this a branch of surgery?Is it mechanical or manual surgery?Does it require previous surgery?What are some of its principles and how applied?For what diseases in this used?What is \"Modernized Chiropractic\"?What is the object of counterfeiting?What is Chiropractic Orthopedy? In Essays on Orthopedic Surgery by Newton M. Schaffer, M. D., we find the following: \"It is the aim of the author to give ashort sketch of what orthopedic surgery is today, and what it demands from those who enter upon its study and practice, fororthopedic surgery may now be ranked among the growing andnecessary specialties.\" Dr. Shaffer defines Orthopedic Surgery. \"That department of general surgery which includes the mechanical treatment of 197THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC chronic and progressive deformities, for the proper treatment of which specially devised apparatus is necessary. \"Orthopedic surgery is placed, by this act, upon the same plane with the other special branches of medicine and surgery. Orthopedic surgery is that department of general surgery which includes the mechanical and operative treatment of chronic and progressive deformities, for the proper treatment of which specially devised apparatus is necessary. I would modify this definition today so that it would read as follows: Orthopedic sur- gery is that department of surgery which includes the prevention, the mechanical treatment, and the operative treatment of chronic progressive deformities for the proper mechanical treatment of which special forms of apparatus or special mechanical dressings are necessary. \"Operative surgery has its own place, and in orthopedic work that place should be second; and operative surgery should be usedby orthopedists only as it supplements mechanical-therapy. \"Orthopedic surgery lies wholly within the domain of chronic surgery.\" \"In order to be explicit, I again submit my definition of orthopedic surgery as read before the Berlin Congress. It is as follows: 'Orthopedic surgery is that department of surgery which includes the prevention, the mechanical treatment, and the operative treatment of chronic or progressive deformities, for the proper treatment of which special forms of apparatus or specialmechanical dressings are necessary.' The underlined words in this paragraph are in italics for emphasis. \"To the legitimate orthopedic surgeon, therefore, operative work takes a secondary and minor position, just as the mechanical part takes by far the more important place. \"In short, if orthopedic surgery is to maintain its position among the specialties of medicine, it must exist upon a mechanical foundation and its disciples must be experts in the use of apparatus. \"America has made by far the most important contributions to, at least the mechanical element in orthopedic surgery, and that the impetus given study of diseased joints and spines by American surgeons has influenced the treatment of these diseases and deformities throughout the world. \"Whether it was Brodie or Harris that first used or pointed out the value of traction in joint disease, or whether the possibility of successfully treating Pott's disease by the modern form of apparatus. \"It will probably not be disputed that Dr. H. G. Davis, formerly of New York, conferred a great benefit upon humanity when hegave his perfected apparatus to the world, embodying the principles of traction. 198ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS \"His plan and simple directions as to the mechanical principles involved in treatment are followed, more or less in detail by almost all who treat diseased spines and joints today. \"After Davis's time, those making any pretense to the treatment of deformities classed joint and spinal diseases as orthopedic; their reputations have been due to a mechanical aptitude in the treatment of the diseases and deformities of the joints and spine. It is perhaps, in this latter field, that Bauer, Sayre, and Taylor appearto the greatest advantage, and the teachings of these gentlemen, allmore or less inspired by Davis, form the foundation of much of theorthopedic surgery practiced in the U. S. today. \"And, without a full discussion of the mechanical treatment of joint disease, no treatise on orthopedic surgery can now be calledcomplete. \"Whether, therefore, the condition be one of lateral curvature, or spinal caries, the indications are to be studied, and these indications are to be met from a pathological, anatomical, surgicaland mechanical standpoint. To do this the orthopedic surgeon must be fully informed upon general medicine and surgery and must be prepared to prescribe his apparatus precisely as a general practitioner prescribes a remedy for disease. \"In order to satisfactorily carry out the system of prescribing apparatus for deformities, the instrument maker should be placed in the same category as the pharmacist, and should supply apparatus for deformities only upon a prescription, i. e., a carefully executed diagram of the apparatus needed. \"But it requires education and a long systematic training to make a competent orthopedic surgeon, and more: it requires a peculiar adaptability to successfully prosecute the mechanical detail in any case of orthopedic surgery, even under the best auspices. The orthopedic surgeon should be able as a matter ofeducation, to make, if necessary, the apparatus which he needs. \"The pathological conditions existing in many cases involving deformities are very serious, and should not be placed in the handsof ignorant or designing men. They can not be successfully handled by even the general practitioner unless he has the time, theability, the experience, and the patience to follow a case in detail for perhaps two or three years. Success comes only through a thorough mastery of mechanical surgery. \"Both before and after Stromeyer's time, however, mechanic- therapy was the fundamental part of the treatment of deformities. \"He also demonstrated the value of traction apparatus for overcoming the deformities occasioned by chronic articularlesions. The treatment of Pott's disease by means of the antero-posterior spinal apparatus, and the subject of the mechanical treatment of chronic joint and spinal disease received a marked degree of attention from the surgeons of the U. S.especially. 199THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC \"In this field Lewis A. Sayre, and Dr. Chas. Fayette Taylor became very conspicuous. They amplified Dr. Davis' apparatus, and devised many forms of apparatus for the treatment of chronic and progressive deformities, and under his able leadership the treatment of chronic and spinal disease became a distinctive fea- ture of the American School of Orthopedic Surgery. \"Up to 1870, or thereabout, it would therefore appear that two important factors had aided in placing orthopedic surgery upon a satisfactory basis: * * * and secondly, the introduction of the portative traction method of treatment of chronic deformity, which after-mechanical treatment is oftentimes more important and essential than the cutting operation. \"The introduction of traction in the treatment of chronic joint disease. \"By the judicious use of traction apparatus, portative or otherwise, deformity can be prevented, and in many cases the disease producing the deformity can be arrested. He gives no assurance of a complete cure. \"Even at this day the general surgeon, as a rule, cares but little for orthopedic work, which requires much patient attention to mechanical detail; which demands special facilities for altering and modifying apparatus, and a special training and education which very few surgeons have received. \"It already represents a great deal, especially in the mechanical treatment of chronic joint and spinal disease. \"This is to be expected, for the author's greatest reputation is based upon his experience in the treatment of joint and spinal disease. The strength of his work, however, lies in its orthopedic part, or in the description of deformities and their mechanical treatment. \"In short, the orthopedic surgeon should take a step in advance of the general surgeon, and that his education should include all that is necessary to make a general surgeon, before his study ofmechanic-therapy is commenced. \"Nor can one expect to equip himself as an orthopedic surgeon in a short time. After graduation, and a term of service as interne in a hospital, a course of study covering at least five years ( including a wide clinical experience in dispensary and hospital work), should be demanded of those who expect to become orthopedic surgeons. Orthopedic surgery lies wholly within the domain of chronicsurgery. \"Still, the orthopedic surgeon should be an educated operative surgeon\u2014 and he should be prepared to operate upon any patient who requires special mechanical treatment after. But the operative treatment should be secondary to the mechanical. \"The future of orthopedic surgery depends upon the deliberate study and development of the mechanical aspect of the work. 200ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS \"It was, however, the mechanical rather than the surgical side of orthopedy of those days which brought to the front the names ofthese who are today recognized as the fathers of orthopedy in thiscountry, and it was the mechanical treatment of spinal disease. \"On previous occasions I have called your attention to the relation of orthopedic surgery to general surgery\u2014 to the necessity of a thorough mechanical training as a preparation for orthopedic work, and to the future demands of orthopedic surgery from a mechanical standpoint. \"The treatment of chronic deformities would be emasculated if mechanical treatment was omitted. \"To the legitimate orthopedic surgeon, therefore, operative work takes a secondary and minor position, just as the mechanical part takes by far the most important place. \"In short, if orthopedic surgery is to maintain its position among the specialties of medicine, it must exist upon a mechanical foundation. \"One may be an operative surgeon and know but little or nothing of real orthopedic work, but the orthopedist must be the one and know the other. \"In closing my remarks, I feel that I ought to state that the conclusions reached are based upon an experience of nearly thirtyyears of orthopedic work.\" With such an extensive experience, the dean of American Orthopedic Surgery ought to be standard. He ought to knowwhereof he speaks. \"From A Text Book of Orthopedic Surgery, by Edward J. Farnum, M. D., I quote the following paragraphs: \"Gibney, in a more recent work, says, 'The more generally accepted definition is, that branch of surgery.' \"The method of treatment may be either medical, surgical, mechanical or moral.\" In speaking of Pott's Disease, he says: \"For convenience the methods of treatment may be considered under four headings. * * *Second, the treatment by supportive mechanical appliances. \"It is difficult to secure sufficient fixation in the recumbent treatment without the use of some form of fixation frame. An extension adjustment can be placed on the ends of the frame so asto produce the required amount of extension of the spine. In some severe cases, fixation of the trunk may be further secured by using sand-bags in connection with the frame.\" Page 169 illustrates one of the many devices with which traction is applied. \"The patient should have extension applied to the spine so as to correct the curves as much as practicable , for by so doing 201THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC the deformity is diminished and the irritation from pressure will be relieved. The extension should not be sufficient to produce pain.\" Under the chapter, \"Deformities of the Spine, Lateral Cur- vatures,\" he says: \"In mild cases and those of short duration, thecurves straighten out under suspension.\" It must be remembered that \"suspension\" is an upright form of traction using the weight of the body for the feet extension. Figure 90, page 191, shows one of the common methods of applying the traction principle. \"Correction of the deformity. A mechanical support is demanded in some cases, not to forcibly correct the deformity, butto act as a support where the spinal structures, ligaments and muscles are too weak to carry the load.\" It will thus be seen thatDr. Farnum has no confidence in mechanical supports for the cureof deformities. Why are \"the spinal structures, ligaments andmuscles too weak to carry the load\"? The cause has not been adjusted, therefore they continue to treat the effects. Chapter on \"Torticollis\" contains the following: \"The principle involved in the mechanical appliance is to obtain fixation on the trunk or shoulders from which counter pressure is made upon the head.\" Dr. Farnum has this to say of \"Ankylosis\": \"The brisement is first applied toward flexion and carried as far as possible, and then extension is made. In many cases the adhesions will yield at once with a sharp crack, or series of cracks, sounding very much as ifthe bone had been fractured.\" Instead of making conditions unfavorable for an ankylosis to exist they endeavor to break the conditions after existence. In other words, treat effects, rather than adjust the cause that made the ankylosis a necessity. \"Bed extension can be accomplished by the use of 'Buck's extension' as employed in the treatment of fractures of the femur. It is fastened to the leg and extension made by a rope over a pulley at the foot of the bed with weight attached. The amounts of weight to be applied should be sufficient to relieve the child. \"A combination of bed-extension and mechanical protection may be had in the use of the bed frame with the traction apparatus applied. \"Mechanical treatment consists in using some form of brace or fixation apparatus, either with or without extension. \"The recumbent and mechanical treatment will produce a cure in many cases, especially if it is mild, or if there is no abscesspresent. When after a reasonable trial of this treatment, no satisfactory progress towards recovery is evident, resort should behad to operative treatment.\" As long as they continue to 202ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS resort to \"treatments\" no satisfactory progress towards recovery would be expected.\" If the cause was adjusted in all acute cases there would be no chronic to run to the impossible stage. Orthopedic Surgery, by Whitman, in speaking of \"Tuberculosis of the Spine,\" says: \"An element of traction gravity is present in some instances. \"This traction is usually applied by means of the halter as used with the jury mast. The straps are attached to a cross bar at theupper extremity of the frame, and traction can be made by simply tightening them, or if the upper part of the frame is somewhatelevated the weight of the patient's body makes the proper extension.\" Under the same head and \"Gradual Correction of Deformity\": \"For example, a certain amount of traction and pressure may be employed with advantage. \"An efficacious method of gradual or non-violent correction is that employed by Goldthwait by horizontal traction and leverage.\" In describing a certain method of spinal treatment, he says: \"If traction is desirable, it can be applied by means of a windlass, which is attached to each end of the frame. \"It may be stated of forcible correction of the spine, that it is in no sense curative; that although it has been proved that the back can be straightened, in many instances with ease, and in most caseswith but little danger, yet the retention of the spine in the correctedposition is difficult, and a certain immediate recoil toward deformity is the rule.\" Whitman is an authority on Orthopedics. He here denies the curative values of methods that forcibly compel the spine to return to its old position. Clinical experience has no doubt forced Dr. Whitman to take this position. If he knew that every spinal disease has a cause, which is a luxation and then knew howto adjust it, his opinion would have been reversed. \"In fact, correction of deformity is in no sense a substitute for prevention. It has rapidly lost favor recently, partly because of recurrence of deformity and partly because experience has shown that the same degree of rectifying may be attained by milder methods.\" Orthopedic Surgery, by Bradford and Lovett, p. 56, says: \"Traction of the spine can be employed by attaching an arm at the head of the frame to secure sling. \"Traction, so much used by the earlier French Orthopedists can hardly be thought to separate directly the diseased vertebrae as was originally supposed, except when applied in the cervicalregion. Experiment has shown that great force is required to pullthe normal vertebrae apart. Traction, or extending weights applied to the trunk, may, however, diminish the physiological curves andthus diminish pressure.\" 203THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC The \"pressure\" so frequently referred to is that which is supposed to be upon the spinal cord. They do not consider that pressure upon the spinal nerves is a possibility. \"In some acute cases this system affords relief, probably as a correction to muscular spasm, and also as a means of fixing thepatient.\" According to these eminent authorities, no cure is possible from the application of traction applied in the spine. \"Traction in the lumbar region may also be applied by em- ploying extension by weight and pulley (as in Buck's extension) to both legs, and raising the foot of the bed.\" Two means of traction are known to orthopedic surgeons. 1st, by the prone position, then applying the pulling device at the head and feet, both working simultaneously; 2d, clasping the axillae and neck from above and hanging the body, so that feet will not touch floor. Thus he gets the same action of the weight of the bodytaking the place of the pulleys at the feet. Bradford and Lovett go at length to describe the latter method, which is reproduced in full. \"Treating by Suspension\"\u2014Treatment of Pott's Disease, acute or chronic, are both referred to. The pressure upon the diseasedvertebrae by super-imposed weight can be removed by suspension. \"Suspending a healthy person by the head obliterates the physiological curves and the spine becomes straight as far as itsformation will allow. The spine of a new born child becomesstraight by suspension, but in an adult the changes in the shape of the bones, strength of ligaments, and the tension of the muscles,prevent the column from becoming perfectly straight. \"In suspension, in old caries, of the spine, it is only the physiological curves which are obliterated, the sharp kyphosis is held too firmly by inflammatory adhesions to permit of correction; in earlier cases with movable vertebrae intravertebral pressure must be, in a measure, diminished at the point of disease by suspension, but suspension does not cause a disappearance of the sharp, angular projections at the point of disease, and in cases that present themselves for treatment and deformity cannot be corrected in that way. In patients suffering with the symptoms of Pott's Disease, relief will be afforded by suspension.\" If these authors understood and knew the cause of such dis- eases they would not waste time in treating the effects by sus- pensory methods. They should suspend with treating effects and adjust cause. If such was done an absolute cure, not \"relief,\" would be the result. In the following paragraph you will notice \"traction\" and \"suspension\" are terms used synonymously. \"The only practical application of continued suspension in the treatment of Pott's disease is found in caries of the cervical region, when suspension can readily be obtained by a jury- 204ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS mast, running up from a plaster jacket as a base, in the manner soon to be described. Traction may be exerted by the elasticity of the bent iron rod forming the upward continuation of the jury-mast. \"A most thorough and exhaustive investigation of the effect of suspension in caries of the spine has been published by Anders (Archiv. f. klinische Chirurgie, 1889, 38 Bd., P. 558). His con- clusions coincide with those of previous investigators, but hisresearches are more thorough than have previously been reported.He proves conclusively that the effect of suspension in caries of thespine is not to separate the diseased vertebrae, or in fact todirectly alter the projection. The flexible portion of the spine isaltered by suspension, as it can also be altered by recumbency, the prone condition, or different attitudes.\" From this high authority we must conclusively draw our conclusions that the traction tables are of no value, if we consider its incipient object, which was to stretch the spine at ankylosed portions and to make the breaking of them easy. The above facts prove that if these machines did accomplish results they would notnow be hunting for something that would. It is ore continualexperiment. Adjusting the cause of each deformity is the properthing to do. This can only be done by hand. There is no machine made in the world that can or slightly assists in adjusting such. Any machine can modify the normal curves in an entirely free spine. Mechanico-therapy cannot loosen the ankylosis. \"This has been proved on the cadaver, and in suspension of patients, the projection at the diseased portion does not disappear. \"Other appliances are numberless, and are chiefly modifica- tions of one or the other of these standard methods of treatment.\" By prone traction or suspension. \"It should be remembered, however, that strain upon the arms or scapulae connected as they are to the spinal column by thetrapezius and the latissisimus dorsi, does not tend to straighten theupper part of the spinal column.\" Pages 64, 66, show many different forms for applying the upright traction method. These are varied somewhat by each orthopedist yet each embodies the same principle, treating effects. \"The use of a distracting force, which is described in the works of the older orthopedic surgeons with the intention of obliteratingthe curve by a direct pull, is inefficient, as the amount of force that can be applied for any length of time is not sufficient to effect as much as the simple position of recumbency. \"The employment of this method for the sale and continued treatment of lateral curvature is, of course, impossible, as the disease ordinarily runs its course through several years, but in extreme cases such methods may be applied temporarily.\" All 205THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC fevers \"runs its course,\" but, nevertheless, it has its cause. Why not adjust that and thus cut short its course? Why not? Page 157 again illustrates three different methods of fixation of traction. Page 181 illustrates a solid bottom table, about four feet wide and six long, running crosswise at the end, a pipe is seen fastenedat the head, from which is a strap with hooks to fasten eachextremity to. This illustration has underneath \"Reclining couch with lateral pressure and traction.\" Figure 237 illustrates \"Reclining couch with Traction by Weight.\" The \"couch\" is so arranged that it can be raised or lowered at the head, leaving the feet stationary. The feet are fastened into a harness and then \"traction\" is applied by weightsattached to the harness which pull over the end of the table over apulley. The amount of \"traction\" depends upon the amount of weights or sandbags that are piled on. In these illustrations the patient is laying face upward, it matters little on this point for before this article is finished au- thorities will be found who describe the same process with face downward. In speaking of the above illustrations Dr. Whitman has this to say: \"The accompanying picture illustrates the forms of a recliningcouch for lateral pressure and a traction force. The latter (traction force) is of little advantage except as a means of securing the patient. \"Spinal couches present a wearisome method of treatment, but in cases which are rapidly becoming worse, they offer the mostthorough means of treatment. \"Corsets and mechanical appliances necessarily weaken the muscles of the back, and are to be avoided if possible, and when they are used, massage is advisable in addition to gymnastics.\" Orthopedic Surgery by Young, says, in defining Orthopedic Surgery: \"Orthopedic Surgery may be defined as that department of surgical science which includes the mechanical and operative treatment of chronic and progressive deformities. \"As a special branch of medicine the sphere of its influence reaches out in three directions. \"Orthopedic is, therefore, a legitimate special section of general surgery. \"As a special branch of surgery, orthopedics dates its existence from the time of Audry (1741), who coined for it a name, and as an established speciality it obtained its first firm foothold upon theprofession. \"Previously and subsequently to Stromeyer's discovery, mechanical appliances formed the fundamental part of the treat- ment of deformities. While the introduction of the antiseptic methods have greatly enlarged the field and precision of ortho- pedic operations, they have not diminished the mechanical in- 206ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS genuity which manifests itself as such an important element in this branch of surgery. The tendency has rather been toward mechanical extravagance. \"Modern ideas demand that the orthopedic surgeon of today should be an educated surgeon, in every sense of the word. Carefully trained in clinical and operative surgery, thoroughly skilled in mechanical principles, he must be equally prepared inall three branches of his special art. \"Every student of medicine upon graduating, or before entering upon the practice of his profession, should be instructed in thefundamental principles and practice of the orthopedic art. The orthopedic art is thus elevated in importance as a special branch of surgery, and the orthopedic surgeon is advanced in dignity and reputation. \"Equipped with modern improved mechanical means, one approaches the subject of treatment of spondylitis with greater confidence than earlier writers could possibly have done. \"An apparatus of this character permits also of extension counter-extension, and fixation, a method of treatment of advantage in cervical disease. Suspension as a mode of treatment is an old plan which has been brought into prominence, it was employed as early as 1826, by Prof. J. K. Mitchell; recently independent of support, as a remedial agent in uncomplicated cases it has no special value. \"It is now recognized that the deformity itself cannot be changed\u2014the vertebral column above and below the gibbosity maybe extended and straightened, but the diseased area remains fixed.In fact, attempts to accomplish this have been followed byimmediate paraplegia and even death.\" No wonder Dr. R\u2014\u2014 was sued for damaging a patient after the use of the traction table. He undoubtedly injured this person. Walked into the office, and after the \"treatment\" was paralyzedfrom hips down. To you \"Chiros,\" remember\u2014\"the diseased area remains fixed.\" You may stretch all you like to break an ankylosis, \"the diseased area\" still \"remains fixed.\" \"The machines and appliances employed are innumerable.\" Pages 46 and 47 show three different illustrations of how to apply traction to the suspended body. Page 102 shows the lower end of the body with traction applied to the limbs. Figure 54, page 103, shows an illustration of patientattached to a bed by straps around shoulders and others pulling onthe legs from below. The description says: \"Bed frame with Traction apparatus added.\" On page 414 we find the following mention of \"traction\" in connection with dislocation of the hip: \"Treatment. Treatment by extension and apparatus. Cases have been reported in which benefit has resulted from the use 207THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC of continuous prolonged tension, but in all these cases there appears to have been some doubt as to the ultimate result. Later, it was arranged that the child should sit up, wearing an appliancewhich exercised traction.\" Orthopedic Surgery, by James E. Moore, M. D.: \"The book is written by a general surgeon who has taught orthopedic surgery for the past decade. \"It is so essentially a part of general surgery. \"It is only within the past few years that this has kept pace with other branches of surgery. \"And when this branch of surgery will be as reserving and as well recognized as ophthalmology is at the present time.\" \"In this esthetic age all are willing to acknowledge the im- portance of this branch of surgery. \"Americans are justly famous for the inventive genius and mechanical ingenuity, and it has been by these means that they have taken the lead in orthopedic surgery. \"The fact that mechanical appliances are so often necessary in orthopedics is one thing that has retarded the progress of this branch of surgery. It requires much time and patience to becomeskillful in their use. \"Orthopedia is a distinct branch of surgery.\" Under the chapter, \"Deformities of the Spine and Thorax,\" he says: \"Shoulder braces or mechanical appliances are to be avoided in these cases, because they do more harm than good. \"Another important method of treatment is mechanical cor- rection by means of a machine by which heavy pressure can be made. The writer has been greatly pleased with the machine originally invented by Schede and modified by Weigel and others. Mild cases can be treated successfully by this method, but it will fail, like all other treatment, in severe cases.\" The Chiropractor longs for the day when he will get his share of the \"mild cases.\" He will then adjust the cause, after which the \"severe cases\" will never exist. If the cause of the \"mild case\" is adjusted, how couldthe case become chronic? \"No special directions need be given as to how to apply the pressure. It is sufficient to say that the various pads and screws must be so adjusted as to apply the force so that it will un twist the back.\" Such is the directions for a machine to correct Scoliosis (Lateral Curvature). He further says: \"The pressure can be gradually increased and the time lengethened as the patient becomes accustomed to it.\" Under \"Pott's disease,\" page 85, is shown an illustration of a child in bed with the traction applied to the head to pull the spine apart. General Orthopedics, by August Schreiber, M. D., says: \"Marked progress has of late years been made in orthopedics, a branch of the surgical art. 208ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS \"Further still, modern orthopedic methods are of greater importance to the physician than those of the past, when the moreactive operative measurers were not countenanced to the samedegree as obtained in other branches of surgery. \"As in every other branch of medicine, so in orthopedics was the outgrowth gradual. * * * There have occurred many serious errors, such as the forcible straightening of the spinal column. \"Others, on the contrary, seek to work solely through the mechanical apparatus. \"We must here refer to a number of methods of great importance in orthopedics, namely, the extension method of Volk- mann, which has quickly obtained acceptance; the use of elastic traction (Bruns, Barwell, Blanc, etc.) \"These advances have led to the rejection of many ancient objectionable methods of treatment; and have caused orthopedics to be considered today an essential part of surgery, and even of an importance from a strictly medical standpoint.\" Page 25 of this work illustrates two methods of suspension for straightening out the curves of the spine. In speaking of these, he says: \"To obtain horizontal extension there are a number of appli- ances applicable to scoliosis, torticollis, etc., which will be spoken of under the subject of 'Curvature of the Spine.' \"We find the principle of vertical extension in ancient ortho- pedic apparatus, such as the Blomer chairs, the Shaw sling, and these are not only useful in case of disease of the spinal column, torticollis, etc., but also for curvature of the limbs. \"Un apareil quelqu'il soit ne vaut que par celui qui l' applique. 'It is not so much the apparatus as the manner of its application which makes it efficient, and badly applied will work harm.' \"As to orthopedic apparatus in general the simplest is the best. Much always depends on the exact application of apparatus, and this is the reason why the aid of an expert orthopedist must, inspecial cases, be invoked. \"We may divide the apparatus into: 1 * * * 2. Reduction means, by which curved or deformed parts are restored to the normal position by traction or pressure.\" Page 28 shows the application of a self-suspending device , at the will of the patient, rather than at the mercy of the doctor. \"A very efficient means of reduction is offered by elastic traction, whereby we may obtain a continuous, slight, graduated force, or, if desired, a very great force (Barwell, Bruns), and we may use for this purpose material with rubber set in (as in theBarwell scoliosis bandage, the Fischer bandage for scoliosis) 209THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC or else rubber bands, or rubber rings which are placed between two straps and the force exerted by which we may graduate, by means of the straps. \"Elastic traction is exerted in many of the recently devised orthopedic appliances, such as the ingenious apparatus of Blanc, and this traction is all the more to be recommended. \"Thus elastic traction is resorted to. \"Among these appliances with elastic traction are included those where groups of muscles are reinforced by the tension in order to antagonize other groups. \"Spiral metallic springs may also be used for traction purposes, as is exemplified in Heather Bigg's extension bed (Fig. 23), which is shown by an illustration which utilizes the foot grip as well as the head screwing devise. \"In case of paralysis, these spiral springs are also resorted to.\" Figure 34 shows a \"Roberts Elastic Extension Bar, which has the object of pulling tighter, making shorter, the straps that pull thehead upward while on one of these 'spinal couches.' \"Formerly the screw mechanism played a great role in orthopedics, and this is not surprising, for, before the introduction of elastic traction, by means of the screw gradual, great power could be obtained according to the desire of the surgeon. \"The most popular was the endless or Archimedas screw, and this was utilized in many contrivances for contracture of theextremities. \"While the simple endless screw is seen in many contracture appliances we also find the manifold endless screw utilized for the purpose of effecting reduction, as in scoliosis contrivances (Langgaard, Eulenberg), antero-posterior curvature of the spine, contrivances which naturally act the more effectively, the longer the lower arms which are adapted to them. \"The suspension, which Guerin formerly used to a great extent, has today much less recognition. A simple screw passes through a stationary nut and presses on the movable arm of a lever, forcing down this end or preventing its elevation, so that excess of movement is impossible. \"With the majority of osteoclasts the portion to be operated upon rests on a hard surface, and at the site of greatest curvature force is exerted through a pad. The simplest instrument of this nature is that of Basch, which acts on the principle of thebookbinders press. Of the osteoclasts, those of Blasius, Oesterlin,V. Bruns, Taylor,\u2014we will only represent Rizzoli's which used for the fracture of rachitic curvatures, andwhich consists of two rings, the one applied above and the other below the site of greatest curvatures these rings hold the bone and are connected by a bar through the middle of which works a screw.To the end of this screw is attached a plate, through 210ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS which pressure is obtained at the eminence of the curvature which is covered by a pad. This pressure is increased until the bone isfractured. The padded rings surround the bone; they are connected bythe iron bar and fixed screws; the large screw is worked down until the pad over the eminence of the curvature is thoroughly adapted, andthen a few quick turns of the screw will break the bone.\" In speaking of Torticollis, he says: \"The simplest apparatus consists in the use of elastic traction. \"Of non-ambulant apparatuses we would refer especially to the Esmarch extension bed. It is a slanting plane on which the patient is fastened by means of Glisson's slings. The patient may rest with relative comfort on this bed.\" Klopsch, as early as the third day, applied permanent extension to the muscles of the neck by means of traction through an apparatusattached; to the head. In this respect he imitated Stromeyer. \"It is in these directions that modern practice has chiefly excelled and especially in that attempts at forcible straightening the spinal column have been condemned. Such methods, however, cannot becarried out without injury to the general health, and in any eventharm may result from uncontrollable movements of the patient. \"Apparatus for preventing involuntary movements on the part of the patients, a matter of the greatest possible importance where thecase affects the vertebrae of the neck, can certainly only be said inchildren who are old enough to be taught the necessity of restraint.Such apparatus may act either through counter-extension by weights or through elastic traction. The patient is placed horizontally on a hard mattress. Extension is obtained by the following mechanism To acollar around the patient's neck a stout string its attached whichpasses over a roller at the top of the bed and carries a weight of fromsix to ten pounds. The weight of the body yields the counter-extension. In case of caries in the dorsal or lumbar region traction may also be made from the axillae. \"Where the disease is located in the middle portion of the spinal column Rauchfuss' suspension girdle may be used. By means of itpressure is removed from the diseased part and the requisite degree of traction is readily obtained by lowering or raising the girdle. This girdle is drawn tightly, transversely over the bed under the affected portion of the spine and direct pressure on the gibbous is avoided. \"One application of the principle of extension which can always be easily and cheaply resorted to, is the upright bed devised by Phelps. \"At an early period apparatus was devised which supported the spinal column through axilla crutches or braces; soon, in order to obtain vertical extension, LeVacher added a suspender 211THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC for the head to the supporting apparatus (an apparatus which, after having long been condemned as dangerous has now again found general application). These extension bandages with dorsal splints and LeVacher's suspender for the head for a long time represented the chief means of treatment. \"It soon became evident, however, that Taylor's machine, which will be more fully described below, acted mainly as animmobilizing splint, that the correction was only apparent, and P. Vogt noted in numerous children that the apparent over-correctionof the anterior inclination was due solely to a lordotic flexion ofthe neighboring segments, while the kyphosis persisted unaltered. He therefore modified Taylor's apparatus by the addition of means for the removal of pressure from the spinal column. He effected this by adding lateral arms with axilla crutches at the levelof the crutches and for the support of the head he added a steelcollar covered with leather and united to an extension from the dorsal splint. All these appliances must be carefully watched; they can only be made by a mechanic, their construction takes time, and they are expensive. \"It is hardly possible to lay too much stress upon the fact that thereby we do not aim at brisement force, or obliteration of the kyphosis, but that we try to circumvent the injurious influence of weight and muscular traction by careful, gentle, suspension, simply sufficient to lessen the pressure on the affected parts. Sayre lays stress on the point that the suspension must be gradual. \"In regard to other apparatus resembling the jury-mast we may mention Roberts' elastic traction head-rest. \"With reference to extension apparatus, Taylor, as has been stated, pointed out the necessity for dorsal flexion, and recom-mended retroflection of the anteflexed spine against a pad placed under the site of curvature. \"In all these apparatus for backward traction the fatal ob- jection lies in the fact that the deformity is increased when thepatient bends forward. \"Great importance attaches also to the passive corrective movements, such as diagonal pressure in stretched suspension, high chest suspension, straddle seat, etc., and particularly lateral suspension over a peculiar apparatus according to the method recommended by Lorenz. \"A couch which is largely used is that of Buhring\u2014an iron plate carrying pads adjustable by screws to bear against theconvexities of the curvature. Schildbach used, instead of wedge pads, and Staffel, has devised a combination of Buhring and Schildbach's apparatus. He used the wedge pad for the lower curvature, and for a dorsal pad a broad oblique belt connected with a strongly curved steel spring; all these parts are adjustable, as in a third padded brass plate. 212ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS \"A variety of apparatus acting by traction and counter-traction has been constructed since the time of Hippocrates, in the shape ofthe extension-beds of Venel, Heine, Valerious, Moncour, Guerin,Bouvier, Pravaz, Major, Coles, and others. On these the poorpatients were formerly tortured for years without effect, so thatVildberger justly condemned them. From the large number weselect only that devised by Heather Bigg, which will be readilyunderstood from Fig. 133 and which permits at least some movements, while the elastic appliances exert constant traction,correcting the curvature, and we also show the simple extensionframe of Beely which may be used in connection with othermethods.\" You will notice in this paragraph that the words \"extension frame\" is used synonymously for the terms traction beds. They are considered one and the same. Each do the same work. These \"extension beds\" are \"readily understood,\" for they are made with a foot clasper and a stretching or weight device at thehead end. The purpose being to use traction upon the body. The length of this article will substantiate the following: \"The number of scoliosis apparatus is enormous and their close description would fill volumes. \"The apparatus which acts by elastic traction devised by Barwell has the advantage of great simplicity; but it can only exert elastic lateral pressure and has no torsional power. \"Where necessary, elastic traction may easily be added over the greatest convexity. \"We may gather from the large number of apparatus for scoliosis that their corrective effect is by no means prompt, andsome authors (Sayre, Dally) reject them all. Sayre at all events goes too far in rejecting all such apparatus as useless and as merely forcing the patient to bear horrible torments.\" In History of Medicine, by Alexander Wilder, M. D., we find this mention of Hippocrates: \"Considering the time andcircumstances, Hippocrates appears to have possessed a veryproficient knowledge of surgery. He devised several kinds of apparatus for curvature and the reducing of luxations.\" Wyeth's Text Book of Surgery, by John A. Wyeth, M. D., in the chapter on Orthopedic Surgery we find the following quotations, inspeaking of \"Spondylitis\": \"The suspension apparatus of Reynders & Co. gives perfect satisfaction. The center and lateral strapsshould be adjusted so that when the lift is made the tension will be equally distributed. \"The patient is to be gently and slowly drawn up by means of the apparatus until he feels perfectly comfortable. \"So that traction by the strips will be directly upward. 213THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC \"The patient is placed upon two tables of equal height, and the tables are then separated so that the parts selected for the zone may be freely accessible from all sides. One assistant grasps the patient under the axillae, the other makes steady but easy traction at the thighs. While the patient is in this prone position, the operator fits the uprights to the line of the transverse process; in other words adjusts the apparatus to the deformity. \"Traction as steadily maintained. \"The suspension carriage of Dr. Meiggs Case, which lifts from the axillae, chin and occiput, is a valuable apparatus in the treatment of Pott's disease in the cervical and upper dorsal regions. Orthopedic Surgery, by Charles Bell Keetley, M. D.: \"In truth, orthopedics as a department of surgery has developed in accordance with professional and individual convenience. \"Extension and counter-extension are made by weights at- tached to the head and upper arms respectively. \"From a wooden yoke or stirrup above the head passes down on each side a piece of strapping, which covers the corresponding sideof the head, the partoid and mastoid regions, and the neck belowthe level of the jaw, but does not reach its fellow of the oppositeside beneath the chin. \"The weight extension is applied to the upper arm exactly in the same manner as that in which it is affixed to the leg. \"Commencing with 4 lb. each, both the two weights should be gradually increased, until in a week they equal 7 lb. each or more, if an increase of weight can be borne and appears to have any beneficial effect. Of course regard must be had to the size and strength of the patient. It is worth while to keep up this weight extension for a month. \"Of portable apparatus for wry-neck there are many varieties. \"The movement may be given by (1) elastic traction, (2) simple traction, (3) pressure. Elastic traction is usually applied by means of an accumulator acting in such a way as to reinforce theuncontracted stereo-mastoid, as e. g., in Sayre's apparatus. Simple traction is applied by leather strap circulets and collars, such as those used with a jury-mast; and, indeed, it requires a jury-mast orsome analogous contrivance, as a stay or support above and to the side of the head. Pressure is applied either to a circlet round the head, or to pads pressing beside the chin on the side, and on the postural region on the other, or to moulded plates, caps or shields.\" After spending many pages describing the curative possibilities, he says: \"Although genuine cure is not to be expected, there is plenty of room for treatment, in fact, treatment is, in most instances, an absolute necessity to prevent increase of thedeformity. 214ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS \"Still other forms of portable apparatus are those by which Barwell has attempted to apply elastic force. \"Passing now to the padded plates which, by means of keys and screws, are made to press against the gibbosities, it must beconfessed their action is often nil, and never more than trivial.Even the most skillful arrangement of pelvic girdle, abdominal or thoracic bands, and perpendicular metals gives them but a feeble leverage. \"Against all contrivances for exercising pressure on the gibbosities the objection may be urged that their action is veryindirect and distant on the spinal curvature itself. \"As extension opens out the curves of the scoliotic spine, it necessarily satisfies indications 1 and 2; i. e., it increases theperpendicular pressure on the side of the convexity of each curveand decreases it on the side of the concavity. \"I have made many measurements and can say positively that an extension of 5/8 of an inch can frequently be kept up for a month. I have frequently found such a patient shorter with the spinalsupport on than with it off, and that, even to a difference of morethan an inch. \"A quarter of an inch is a very respectable amount of extension for a steel appliance to keep up. Extension.\u2014Extension is effected either in (1) the upright position, (2) the horizontal, or (3) the inclined. \"The practice of extension in the upright position, excepting in so far as it was supposed to be affected by spinal stays and corsets had fallen into entire disuse for more than half a century until a few years ago it was revived by Sayre. But it was originally devised and employed by the illustrious Glison 230 years ago, andalso by Nuck forty years later. The method by which they obtained their vertical extension was practically the same as the plan of suspension which we now employ. About 130 years ago Levacher de la Feutrie, in the Memoirs of the French Academy of Surgery, described, with excellent drawings, a kind of stays bearing what we should now call a jury mast, which took off the weight of the head by means of a chin and head strap. \"So long as the suspension is kept up there must be an in- creased pressure on the convex border of each curve\u2014 in other words, on the side towards which the individual vertebrae arethickened\u2014whilst there must be a negative pressure on the otherside. It has been urged with some truth that the extension may tend to stretch and weaken the ligaments uniting the vertebrae. \"Horizontal Extension. This is undoubtedly a very powerful means of acting on the spine, and one which can be kept invigorous action for many hours out of every twenty-four. It was formerly extremely popular, especially in continental orthopedic institutions. Indeed, it is a method especially adapted for 215THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC use under circumstances where the patient can devote all his time to treatment and be under the constant skilled superintendence. The great objection to the treatment, as generally practiced, are that being kept up, as a rule, eighteen hours out of the twenty-four it is inconsistent with proper participation in ordinary social and educational life. \"The appliances for horizontal extension consist of a flat bed or couch with a collar or chin and occiput strap, similar to thoseused for suspension, but carefully padded and also a well padded,well fitting pelvic girdle of leather. Axillary loops are also oftenused. The head and axilla gear are merely fixed by two leatherstraps which pass downward, one along the outside of each leg,and are united by a crossbar below the feet. The force itself maybe applied by means of a screw, but it is much better to use aweight and pulley. The amount of weight cannot be arbitrarilyfixed. It is to be determined by observing the effect on the patient's spine, and must, of course, stop short of causing pain or discomfort. If the inclined plane be used instead of the horizontal, the weight may be dispensed with. The extension is produced bygravity acting on the patient's pelvis and lower extremities. \"Certain points must be carefully attended to in the use of extension on the horizontal couch or inclined plane. The weight must be applied very gradually, commencing with a very light pullincreased until the maximum is reached. \"Half a century ago it was the common custom to keep scoliotics continually in the horizontal position for months, or evenyears, much to their detriment. Now I know of no one who would prescribe its use for more than 18 hours out of the 24. In the remaining six the greatest care must be taken to preserve whatgood effects may have been secured from the horizontal extension. \"The employment of the inclined plane in the treatment of scoliosis was originally due to Reasmus Darwin, the grandfather of the investigator of the origin of man. \"Compression in the horizontal position. There are at least three ways in which this is applied, (1) by screw force, (2) byelastic force, and (3) the weight of the body is itself made to supplythe compression, any one of these may be combined withhorizontal extension. \"Principles 1 and 2 can be effectively applied only by means of special apparatus. As may be imagined, there are many differentways of fixing and arranging the requisite screws, springs, paddedplates, and girdles. Of course, the pressure is, as a rule, applied to the convexities, e. g., to the dorsal gibbosities, and the counter-pressure above and below, e. g., in the axilla and against the loin of the opposite side \"By real extension I mean the actual separation of diseased surfaces, indicated by the opening out of the angle of an angular 216ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS curvature. At the International Congress of 1881, Mr. Edmund Owen spoke warmly of the barbarity and danger of attempting to effect this; \"But of the apparent extension effected by suspension and the application of the jacket, the greater part takes effect in the parts of the spine above and below the seat of disease. \"Extension is applied to a patient in bed by means of an arrangement of straps precisely analogous to the stirrup by whicha leg is extended. The extensive force is a weight connected with apulley. Cases treated by extension in bed are generally eithercervical or upper dorsal. The stirrup is then attached to the headand counterextension can be obtained by raising the head of thebed, or, if preferred, by extension from the hips downwards. If the disease is lumbar, the strapping should be applied, not to the head, but to the skin of the thorax. \"A mode of rest which tends to effect extension in some cases is the prone couch. But in practice the prone couch, if used continuously, is generally more disagreeable to the patient thanbeneficial to his spine. I know of no results attainable with it which the surgeon cannot more conveniently attain without it. \"M. Chipault 'advises only gentle traction and light com- pression under chloroform.' \"Serious and fatal consequences have now been repeatedly observed after the forcible straightening of angular curvatures. \"With regard to the manner of straightening out the spine it is done by combined extension of the patient and compression of theboss. The patient is laid prone upon a table; the hips and the upperpart of the sternum are raised on padded blocks. The extendingforce is applied on the one hand to the legs, on the other to thehead, and sometimes also to the arms, if the angle is not too high in the dorsal region. Calot put the limit of justifiable force at eighty kilogrammes or one hundred and fifty-six pounds. \"The pressure on the boss should be of less weight than the extension and time should be taken. Robert Jones and Tubby give us an average duration of after-treatment two or three years, which is probably not too much. \"Both the leather collar and chin strap used to be employed to produce extension in spinal curvature many years ago.\" Willitt's Method. In the case of an adult this requires more elaborate arrangements than in the case of a child. As practiced byMr. Willet it may be thus described: The apparatus are two sets of pulleys, a jack towel and a broad band of leather with rings at each end. This band of leather is divided longitudinally at eachextremity to near the middle so that it may be said to have fourtails. 217THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC \"The patient lies in the prone position on a stretcher, truck or table, and the two pulleys are fixed to hooks, over above thepatient's head, the other above the buttocks or thighs. The leatherband above described is placed transversely beneath his chest, atthe root of the neck, the two tails at either end of the strap beingcarried, one across the axilla and the other over the shoulder, bothbeing then carried up and connected with the pulleys above thepatient's head. \"The jack towel is spread out beneath the patient's thighs from hips to knees, and its two ends connected with the posterior set of pulleys. \"Now the two pulleys are put in action until the patient swings untie his elbows just touching the table beneath him. \"In this position cramps, or 'pins and needles' in the arm are not infrequent . \"Or the child can be stretched from one stool to another. Some soft material should be placed beneath its elbows, and its mothershould watch to see that it does not fall. \"Or\u2014and this is the best extempore form of this series of arrangements\u2014place two chairs and a pole of wood across themfrom the back of one to the back of the other. The whole can, ifdesired, be placed on a long table instead of on the floor. The poleis preferable square in section. It should be firmly lashed to thechairs. The hips are suspended by a towel, not spread out, lest itkeep the knees up, and thus produce that excessive hollowness ofthe lumbar spine which is to be avoided in dorsal cases. \"The problem then is to keep up extension while the trans- ference from the perpendicular to the horizontal is being effected.\" Manual of Surgical Operations, by J. Coster, M. D., 1825, says: \"If surgery be the most efficacious recourse of the healing art, it isonly, as Prof. Richerand observes, in the hands of such as cultivateit with the diligence it merits. \"A very great difference of opinion has long subsisted among surgeons, relative to the mode in which counter-extension should be made, and a very great variety of machines have been invented for the purpose of accomplishing it. At present, At present, the most generally used apparatus is some modification of Desault's splint, or of the inclined plane, which are found to be capable of effecting all that can be expected from machinery, without the risk and expense which many of the more recent splint, etc., produce.\" A Treatise on Orthopedic Surgery, by A. H. Tubby, M. D.: \"That this volume may be a reliable guide to medical men, in the treatment of deformities, and to advanced students in the un- derstanding of a somewhat difficult branch of surgery, is the wish of the author. \"Treatment Directed to the Spine.\u2014 The principles of treatment are three in number\u2014 218ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS \"(a). To fix the vertebral column, and to place it in the best possible circumstances for healing. \"(b). To remove the weight of the upper part of the body from the diseased vertebrae. \"To carry out these principles we have two methods at our disposal, viz.: recumbency and the use of retentive appliances. They may be employed separately or in combination in individual cases, but can never be used indiscriminately. The precise value of each varies. \"The complexity, weight and intricate mechanism of the apparatus described in some books would almost make one believe that their designers were about to return to the days of AmbrosePare's hammered cuirass, with steels and springs superadded. \"Serve merely as fixation appliances, only temporarily during suspension as a means of traction. \"When to perform an operation is guided by the following: In cases where the lesion seems to indicate the failure of mechanical treatment. \"In cases where, during the employment of intelligently applied apparatus, the symptoms continue to increase in severity. \"In cases where, after a certain period of careful mechanical treatment, say eighteen months, the condition has remainedstationary.\" Under kyphosis, \"Artificial supports in the majority of cases are faulty in theory and pernicious in practice. I allude to shoul- der, braces, back supports. \"A useful combination of couch and exercising apparatus has been designed by Mr. Adams. The exercise essentially consists inthe patient drawing herself up the inclined plane, whilst the body is resting on the sliding board or movable stage, which is softlycushioned. \"The patient should draw herself up and allow herself to descend by her body weight five to ten times. \"The treatment by suspension has already been spoken of, and is to be depreciated, if used for every case. In relaxed spines suspension will probably make them worse. A modification of theusual suspensory has been introduced by Mr. Adams. \"The treatment of congenital wry-neck is either manipulative, mechanical or operative.\" The following is found under the head of \"Contractures and Ankylosis\": \"Gradual extension by weights and instruments. From experience I do not think that any particular advantage is obtainedby these means. If the fibrous ankylosis is so firm as to require theforce obtained by screws and racks to make it yield in somedegree, then this treatment had better not be undertaken.

The usual methods are used for extension. \"Volkmann also obtained good results by these methods of extension with abduction. \"I have tried the treatment by recumbency and extension in two cases with a great measure of success.\" After description of these cases, he says: \" I do not claim that these cases are cured, but so far there is every indication of it, and I shall take an opportunity of reporting their condition. \"It is very evident that treatment on these lines is very tedious to a degree and difficult to carry out. \"With reference to the use of retention-apparatus, my ex- perience is that directly they are removed the spasm returns. \"Other spinal diseases such as winch cannot unfortunately be remedied by orthopedic surgery.\" The American Text Book of Surgery has thirteen prominent authors. Chapter on \"Surgery of the Spine,\" says: \"Treatment.\u2014 Perhaps the most important advice to be given to the general practitioner in relation to the treatment of this condition is a caution against the use of braces, corsets, jackets and other mechanical appliances which, by confining the movements of the chest and supplying an artificial support in place of the muscles which it is most desirableto develop, actually do great harm to many patients instead of good.\" On page 557 is a drawing showing how to apply the cervical extension while prone in bed. Pp. 558 and 559 show more illustrations of the suspension idea. The reader will bear in mind that the terms traction, suspension, extension or counter-extension are equivalent for the other. \"This in many cases can be done by the usual methods of extension and counter-extension with manipulation.\" Congenital and Acquired Deformities, by A. B. Judson, A.M., M.D.: 220ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS \"Recognition of Mechanical Surgery. It need not, however, on that account, be omitted from the armamentarium of the surgeon.\" In 1862, Dr. Stephen Smith wrote: \"It must be evident to everyone that mechanical surgery is a branch, and a most desir-able one, of surgical science and art. It is not simply a branch ofmechanics to which any ingenious artisan can successfully turn hisattention; it requires also an accurate knowledge of anatomy, of physiology and surgery. Rationally, the mechanical surgeon must be a thoroughly educated physician as well as an inventive genius. \"A better plan is to assume that mechanical assistance is required at the outset\u2014and will be necessary throughout the time of growth, afterward. It is true that treatment thus prolonged and troublesome can only palliate and not cure. It implies also exacting attention to mechanical details, frequent supervision, and many alterations and adjustments of apparatus in response to the demands. \"The result of treatment falls short of perfection, but the same may be said, as a rule of the treatment of spinal deformity andjoint diseases, and in fact, nearly all of the affections in orthopedicsurgery. \"The limitations of achievements are so conspicuous and so sure to bring discredit upon medical authority that it seems to have been agreed that the inevitable may well be transferred to a specialist. \"Experience has shown that certain effects supposed to be produced were impossible, and others which might have beenpracticable were unnecessary. Traction simply stays the joint and relieves the pain, while the patient runs about and follows the ordinary pursuits of his time of life for the months and years required to bring about recovery, with restoration of ability and symmetry, so far as may be. \"That traction owed its efficiency to its ability to overcome the muscles which were thought to be destroying the joint by their reflex contraction. \"If, on the other hand, the traction applied were elastic and unyielding, the stretching which it could give to the muscles would soon have been arrested by the ligaments, and in any event it would have been insignificant in view of the elongation to which they had been accustomed in the alterations of contraction andrelaxation. \"If, indeed, traction could have been applied directly to the bone without the intervention of the soft parts, it possibly mighthave been in a position to counteract the muscles. It had to beapplied, however, to the skin, which was but an elastic envelope ofa mass composed largely of relaxed muscular and yielding tissue. 221THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC \"When the muscular spasm is urgent, fixation cannot be secured, save by the use of force as constantly acting as that whichis to be overcome, and the agent best adapted to this purpose istraction. \"When pain is thus seen to be controlled equally by tractive and retentive apparatus, the correlation of traction and retention is evident. \"That traction secures fixation is capable of demonstration. \"To say that traction stretches the muscles until they act directly as retentive splints overlooks the lengthening which be-longs to them in customary relaxation. \"If the pulley is attached to the wall of the room at a con- siderable height, the direction which the traction takes may be changed. \"Difficulty of direct mechanical reduction. Indirect removal of deformity in the way proposed would obviate the necessity ofrestoring to direct mechanical correction. It is noteworthy that an extreme deformity is more easily reducible by direct mechanical force than a moderate one. A metallic rod bent as in an inverted V may be readily straightened somewhat by manual traction and counter-traction, as in Fig. 104 (which looks like the inverted V half straightened), and still further by the same forces mechanically applied, as in Fig. 105\" (which is traction by weight). \"It is evident, however, that the straighter the rod becomes the harder it is to make further straightening by traction. It is questionable whether traction can produce absolute straightness.It certainly cannot over-straighten the rod. But if traction and counter-traction are replaced by the leverage of pressure and counter-pressure, as in Fig. 106 (representing pressure being given downwards at the highest point of the inverted V), the rod may bemore than straightened without much trouble. \"Pott's Disease. In the hip fixation is successfully and with advantage developed by traction, and this may be applied to the uppermost region of the spine when the patient is recumbent. It may, therefore, be inferred that fixation of the erect spine is sought only by applying a retentive lever designed for making pressure at the level of the projection and counter-pressure above and below. \"If such an apparatus, efficient in theory, proves not to be mechanically perfect in practice, it will still be found to be useful. The force applied to oppose deformity is unfortunately largely absorbed in bending backward sound portions of the columnabove and below the point of disease. \"But if the pressure is lightly applied at first, and gradually and carefully increased from time to time, it will be found as the weeks and months pass that the skin will have become hardenedwithout losing its integrity or causing discomfort, and its 222ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS condition will indicate whether or not the patient is receiving the full benefit of mechanical treatment. \"Treatment of Lateral Curvature. Although it may not be possible to make an established curvature disappear, careful treat- ment may be expected partly to reduce the deformity or to render itless noticeable. \"It would seem that rotation could be diminished, temporarily, at least, by rolling the chest forcibly between the palms, but it is beyond the power of mechanical therapeutics to produce andprolong this effect. \"Antero-Posterior Pressure. For many years the opinion has been under consideration that antero-posterior pressure, long continued and forcible, would be curative in lateral curvature as in Pott's Disease. The plan is certainly attractive from a mechanical point of view. This plan may be compared and con- trasted with the common method of making lateral pressure on the projecting ribs, which is open to the objection that although such pressure is to all appearances reasonable applied to reduce anobvious projection, it is applied to the ribs, which show an incidental deformity, and not to the curving spine which is the seat and origin of the trouble. If pressure could be made by invadingthe cavity and pushing laterally and forcibly against the bodies of the vertebrae, it is conceivable that both curvatures and rotation could be opposed by one motion.\" Erichson's Science and Art of Surgery, Vol. I. John Erichson. Page 593 shows the application of the common traction prin- ciples to a patient laying in bed. Orthopedic Surgery. Lewis A. Sayre, M. D.: \"Since that time many gentlemen in different parts of the world have devoted special attention to this particular department of surgery; and many improvements have been made in the mechanical devices for the purpose of relieving deformities of various parts of the body; still at present orthopedic surgery is but imperfectly understood among us . It shall be my endeavor so to develop this department of surgery. \"Many complicated contrivances have been devised for the application of mechanical force. As a general rule, elaborate and complicated instruments should be avoided. It should act in itstractile force gradually and constantly. The persons in charge of, and using the apparatus, should thoroughly understand their manner of action, be perfectly acquainted with their mechanism. \"I have been enabled to test the principle of extending a contracted muscle by the constant application of an elastic force, moderately but persistently applied. \"I have made use of elastic extension. The difficulty in its application, in many instances, without expensive and cumber- 223THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC some machinery to secure its attachment, in order to obtain its force, was the only obstacle to its universal employment. At the foot of the bed a pulley is to be arranged in such a manner as the ingenuity of the surgeon dictates, the cord from the footboardplaced upon it and a weight attached, just sufficient to make extension as will render the patient comfortable. \"For a weight, a bag of shot or sand is most convenient, because the amount can then be very easily regulated. \"To prevent the patient slipping down in the bed it should be raised ten or twelve inches by means of bricks or blocks.\" Page 469 illustrates the extension idea by means of a tripod. Three legs meeting above high enough that a pulley and rope canbe fastened, from which the patient can apply the traction himself. In speaking of \"Rotary-lateral curvature\" and its \"treatment\" he says: \"Almost an innumerable variety of instruments have been devised for the treatment of this deformity. \"The use of all fixed apparatus in the earlier stages, as in the treatment of all deformities where we wish to restore lost muscularpower, is positively injurious. The principle which should guide you is, to place upon the stretch those muscles which have beeninactive and relaxed, and approximate the origin and insertion ofthe muscles you wish to remain quiescent. \"Various instruments have been devised for the purpose of restoring the spine to its normal position in lateral curvature;using for this purpose levers, springs, ratchet and keys, etc., se- cured to the instrument and being most ingenious mechanicalcontrivances, consisting of, a pelvis belt fastened securely around the body with side-bars attached, and passing upward, from whichare passed straps over the shoulders, thus holding the body firmlytogether, and pressure being then applied to the side by the means above stated, in order to force the spinal column straight. All suchinstruments are absolutely useless, and compel the patient toundergo untold misery and torture. You might as well take a pieceof wire in the shape of the letter S and nail it at its two extremitiesto a board, and then attempt to straighten it by lateral pressureand counter-pressure on either side; you will not succeed without loosening one or the other extremities and thus allowing it toextend. \"Self-suspension diminished the deformity and greatly in- creased his capacity for respiration, as soon as it was discontinued, the patient felt great discomfort, and the deformity immediatelyreturned. \"When I place this man within a sling passing under the axillae, and another band under the chin and occiput, and elevate his body by drawing the pulley, you immediately see this broad band of the latissimus dorsi muscle brought prominently into view, and it is an impossibility to bring him straight until this 224ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS muscle is either cut or ruptured. While he is thus stretched out, I make pressure upon this muscle with my finger, and he instantlyhas a spasmodic contraction of nearly all the muscles of his body,thus proving that this muscle is contractured, and that no power, no matter how long continued, can stretch it to its normal condition.On the contrary, I have proved to you over and over again, thatwhen this structural shortcoming has taken place, which is made evident by the reflex spasm which is produced in it by pressureupon its fibres when under extreme tension, c ontinued stretching tends only to irritate that muscle and cause it to undergo strongerand stronger contractions, and that any attempt to stretch a muscle thus changed in structure excites additional irritation, rather thanproduces any elongation of its fibres.\" (The above was written in connection to the treatment of scoliosis, lateral curvature.) \"Here, again, we find that a number of instruments have been devised for overcoming the deformity, but the greater portion ofthem are entirely unnecessary.\" Orthopedic Surgery, by Louis Bauer, M. D.: \"In former times, the so-called orthopedic beds were employed to overcome the deformity. Their chief design was longitudinal extension; some of them combined pressure upon the convex portions of the spine. The construction of these beds, of which a great variety have been introduced into orthopedic practice, beargreat resemblance. A belt for the pelvis is connected by straps with a cog-wheel at the foot of the bed, and an appropriate apparatus for the head with the opposite part of the bed. After the patient has placed herself upon the bed, belt and head piece are adjusted and the extension made by means of the cog-wheel. For the sake of lateral pressure, either cushions or wedge-formed pads were brought to bear upon the spine. During a long period the mechanical bed was the only remedy in vogue against scoliosis, and great ingenuity has been employed in its construction. Its unsatisfactory results. \"Thus changes in the construction and improvements were carried on until Guerin and Major put a stop to them by demonstrating that longitudinal extension was a failure, unlessaccomplished by direct action upon the curvature. Since then, mechanical ingenuity has been thrown into a new channel, with aview of constructing apparatus acting by lateral pressure and counterpressure. In the latter stages they are, however, inefficientand unable to realize the presented indications. \"The pad for the lumbar deformity is but narrow, but it should be large enough to embrace the side of the body. The pad designed for the thoracic curvature is of much larger size in order to cover the protruding ribs and shoulder blade.\" Orthopedic Surgery. Henry Jacob Bigelow, M. D. This book, in article form, won the Boylston Prize in 1884, for the 225THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC best article upon the above subject and the best handled. Let us see some of these prize-winning sentiments. \"The principle of the various machines contrived for this purpose is simple, and are fixed by ordinary mechanical expedi-ents, such as a ratchet-wheel, rack and pinion, or best, by a perpetual screw. \"A complete machine, the force of which is adapted as well to the spine as the head, is complicated and expensive. Variousmodels have at different times been contrived for this purpose. They are adapted either to the horizontal or upright position. The former have received the name of orthopedic beds, and are chiefly modifications of those of Shaw and Guerin. \"The head is secured by a horizontal metallic band, descending upon the mastoid processes, which gives attachment to cervicalstraps for the crown and chin. The iron rod by which it is attached to the steel plate between the shoulders, is so contrived as to admit of elongation, extension, flexion, rotation and lateral inclination,in any of which positions it may be fixed. \"The orthopedic bed of Guerin is modified from that of Shaw. It consists of the divided bed, of which the superior point of division corresponds to the union of the cervical and dorsal re-gions, instead of corresponding to the central dorsal, as in thatemployed for lateral curvature of the spine. The body is secured upon the bed, and appropriate lateral force is applied. The head is confined in a casque, and is secured by a collar adjusted to a chin. Extension is then effected by the weight of the body. I am not persuaded that the mechanism is the simplest and most effectual. \"The question relates to the duration and efficiency of the mechanical treatment. \"Distortion of the spine is less amenable to treatment than other deformity; chiefly, perhaps, from the difficulty of applying to it a permanent and properly directed mechanical force. \"The results of the treatment of spinal curvatures are, as might be expected, much less satisfactory than those of most otherdistortions, while the time required is longer. \"Mechanical treatment is effected by mechanical beds, in which force is applied horizontally. \"Various orthopedic beds have been devised for the purpose of effecting horizontal extension. In these the force is best applied in one or two ways. \"1. In a direction parallel to that of the spine. 2. In a direction perpendicular to it. \"Parallel extension is effected by fixing the pelvis and apply- ing an extending power to a series of straps around the chin andhead. This is best effected by the machine about to be described. \"This method is applicable in old and very pronounced cur- vatures, where the extent of the curve gives power or purchase 226ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS to this simple traction. Continued force of this sort is liable to produce a relaxation of the ligaments, which predisposes the spineto a recurrence of the deformity. Many young people treated inestablishments where these beds are exclusively employed, havetheir backs fattened, the shoulders and other regions of thevertebral column being reduced to the same plane. These ill effects are to be combated. \"The method which Guerin has called sigmoid extension consists of several elements. \"The first of these is parallel extension, the head and pelvis being respectively attached to the top and bottom of the bed. \"The second is a lateral force applied to a point upon the side of the trunk corresponding to the convexity of the curve, and in a direction perpendicular to it. The action is analogous to that of straightening a bow, when the extremities are held in the hands andthe knee is applied at an intermediate point of the convexity. It has several advantages over parallel extension. The power is appliedto greater advantage. \"A third peculiarity is the combination of flexion and ex- tension.\" Erichson's Science and Art of Surgery, Vol. II, by Eric Erichson, M. D.: Page 432 says: \"The indication that the proper amount of extension has been made with the pulleys, is the comfort ex- perienced by the patient. \"The essential points to be attained by this treatment are: 1st, Moderate extension of the diseased spine by suspension; 2d, Fixation of the spine when so extended. It fulfills one indication by securing moderate extension of the diseased spine at the time of its application. \"As in all other cases where bone is diseased, at least three years must be devoted to the cure of a case of angular curvature.But that cure consists only in the preservation of life, not theremoval of deformity, which is the inevitable result of carious ankylosis. Page 458 shows a patient lying on the bed, underneath which is an iron oblong frame, the upper part of which is strapped to the bed and the patient to the upper end of the frame, at the lower end is the traction apparatus. \"The mechanical contrivances constructed for the purpose of taking the weight of the head, neck and upper extremities off from the weakened spine are of various forms and have had much ingenuity expended in their construction. They all have three principal objects, however much their details may vary, viz.: 1, * * * 2, to carry off the weight of the head and upper extremities from the spine by means of lateral crutches; 3, to influence the convexities of the spinal curve by means of movable plates, actedupon by rack and pinion or screw power. 227THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC The treatment of Posterior Excurvation of the spine is con structed essentially on the same principles as that for lateral curvature, with the exception that the back-plate is so arranged as to press upon the projection.\" A Manual and Atlas of Orthopedic Surgery, James K. Young: \"This manual and atlas of orthopedic surgery is the result of an experience of twenty years. \"Orthopedic surgery may be defined as that department of surgical science which includes the preventive, mechanical, and operative treatment of chronic deformities. \"As a special branch of medicine. \"The orthopedic surgeon of today must be an educated sur- geon, thoroughly skilled in mechanical principles, * * * the application of apparatus. \"Measurement and the application of mechanical appliances will demand the greatest attention. \"The orthopedic art is thus elevated in importance as a special branch of surgery, and the orthopedic surgeon is advanced in dignity and reputation. \"The earliest writings upon the causes of congenital deformity are found in the Ajur-Veda of Susruta, about 800 B. C.\" Page 3 illustrates three old wood cuts which are worthy of special description. Fig. 1 shows a stone slab about six feet long,four feet wide, and two feet high. Upon this, lying face downward, is a patient. He has straps around the ankles, knees, and hips, which are attached together by ropes which run to the foot of the slab; they are here tied around a long upright pole, which isplaced on the floor at bottom of the slab. The illustrationrepresents a man pulling the upper end of this lever backward,thus getting a large leverage. Straps also are clasped around theaxillae and neck with a large lever, the same as at the feet, whichis also being pulled by a man at that point. Thus it will be seen that with such great levers great power in traction can be ac- complished. To complete the work of making pressure a third partyis sitting on the middle of the back. Fig. 2 is practically the same as 1. Fig. 3 represents more study from the point of how pressure is produced. The illustration shows the patient being \"stretched\" in the same manner as described in Fig. 1. The slab is represented close to a brick wall. Several bricks, lower than the level of thepatient's superior surface of his body have been removed,allowing a large oak board to be slid therein. This is then broughtdownward. The plank looks at least eight feet long. At the extremeouter end of this is the third person a-straddle, spring-boardfashion. The patient's body representing the elevated outer. Thisglues great pressure and more leverage upon the spinal columnthan in the first case. 228ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Page 6 shows several new types of traction apparatus. \"In 1806 Johann George Heine modified the extension bed of Venel. \"In 1830 Audrey and Portal condemned the exclusive use of extension beds and objected to their being used except as an adjunct. \"To Delpech, the scientific founder of orthopedics, this branch of surgery. \"Traction with the patient placed upon the couch or bed. \"Different forms of this variety of traction appliances have been devised, among which may be mentioned as especially valu-able the Freiburg extension (and the Taylor extension).\" Page 154 shows an extension device. \"Treatment, by recumbency. Recumbency as a means of treatment still has its advocates. Such an oblong bed can be constructed, at a moderate cost, of light gas pipe or stout steel bars. An apparatus of this character permits also of extension, counter-extension and fixation, a method of treatment of great advantage in cervical disease. \"While in the recumbent position, traction upon the spine should be made, in cervical and dorsal cases, by a head extension, of which there are many forms in use; and in lumbar disease the traction should be made by adhesive plaster extension applied to the lower extremities. In severe forms of disease traction may be made from both ends at the same time. \"The vertebral column above and below the gibbosity may be extended and straightened, but the diseased area remains fixed. Infact, attempts to accomplish correction by complete suspensionhave been followed by immediate paraplegia and death. \"When the patient is suspended by the neck, the rope should never be tied, but should be held by an assistant, as an accident or even a fatal result might occur in this manner. \"At the present time there are several methods which aim at the gradual correction of the deformity by the employment of traction and pressure \"And the power applied above to pull the part above the kyphosis back as far as possible.\" Page 256 shows the \"Goldthwait Extension Frame with Patient in Position.\" It plainly shows the patient clasped at the feet and hips and then extension made by way of the head. Fig. 298. \"Apparatus for Forcible Correction in Pott's Dis- ease.\" The table represented is about eight feet long. At the foot are two ankle straps, into which the feet are fastened securely. At the head is an upright standard, through which a screw shank about two feet long, at the internal end of which is a head and shoulder fastening device. The patient is placed face downward. 229THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC After placed in position, before tightening on the traction a transverse hollow upper chest rest is placed into position; this is destined to raise the body about one foot from the surface of thetable. A large, solid pillow is placed under the hips; traction is then applied. He now represents the body high at the buttocks and shoulders, with the spine caved toward the table. The limbs and shoulders are not touching the table, due to the intense traction. After all is secured he has a half or semi iron hoop, which fastens to each side of the table and makes a half circle over the body to the other side. Running through the center f rom above downward, is an adjustable pad, by means of screws which grad - uated the height and consequently the power necessary to treat thevarious diseases of the spine. The methods are clearly shown and no question can be placed on the intentions of the author. Theideas he wished to convey are clearly illustrated. \"The operation as performed by him (Chipault) consisted in direct traction upon the deformity, and the reduction of the kyphosis by pressure the amount of traction being estimated atfrom 60 to 160 pounds, and the pressure from 30 to 80 pounds. He reported 204 patients operated upon, with two deaths within two days and three deaths at a period subsequent to the operation. Partial paralysis followed in one case, and in another case an abscess developed shortly after the operation. \"The amount of force required is not so great as was rec- ommended by Calot, as by using less violent measures the dangerof damage to the surrounding structures may be avoided. Theamount of force required should be determined by the yielding ofthe deformity, and two or more trials may be made before finallyresorting to laminectomy. \"In performing the operation of forcible correction the patient is in the prone position . An anesthetic is given and the patient placed with the face down upon a firm table. Traction is made upon the head by means of a bandage or leather head support and upon each extremity by the hands of assistants, there being five thus employed. Gentle downward pressure is made upon thedeformity * * * the deformity gradually yielding and the adhesions being broken. \"The experience which I have had in this operation leads me to consider it an unnecessarily severe procedure, and one liable to befollowed by general tuberculosis, tubercular meningitis,paraplegia, abscess, rupture of abscesses, rupture of the pleuraand exacerbation of the tuberculous process.\" Fig. 437 shows a lever forcible correction method. An upright is on the left side of the table, standing about one foot higher thanthe patient's body, who is lying on his side. From the top of thisstandard is a long iron rod reaching to the opposite side, from theinner third of which is a steel pad, although fastened 230ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS to the cross piece, drops downward. With this long lever great pressure can be exerted, hence forcible correction. Fig. 438 shows another form of the table described in the paragraph above. Fig. 439 is another modification of the above. Each of these has a different kind of screwable pressure from above downward. Each of these forms has this apparatus adjustable to any portion of the spine, and any height, Each foot extension stretcher has a handle to turn, thus making the screw pulling device complete. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Chiropractic Orthopedy. Orthopedy is derived from two Greek words: orthos\u2014straight, and pais\u2014child. Its early use implied the art of removingdeformities in young children. Its meaning has been graduallyextended until it now means the prevention and curing ofdeformities in persons of all ages. Chiropractic is from two Greek words: cheir\u2014the hand, and praktos\u2014done: done by hand; a hand practitioner, one who ad-justs, repairs with his hands; hand fixing; so that Chiropractic Orthopedy means axing the causes of deformities in children andadults by adjusting the causes by the hands. The word Orthopedy has always been used in connection with surgery. Orthopedic surgery is a part of surgical science whichuses mechanical and operative treatment for chronic andprogressive deformities. Chiropractic Orthopedy does not use mechanical appliances nor operative surgery, but teaches how to adjust the human ma- chine so that Innate can right the wrongs done. The appliances of Orthopedic Surgery consist of an innu- merable variety of trusses, braces and supports, made to suit eachsurgeon's fancy to fit each individual case. Plaster of parts islargely used for fixation and reduction of deformities; it is madeinto bandages, splints, jackets and corsets. Traction and suspensionare favorite methods of Orthopedic Surgeons, the former is doneby weights, pulleys and screw stretchers, the latter by hanging thepatient, thereby using the gravity of the body instead of weights ofsand or other material. Forcible traction and suspension are evenobliterated for the time being, but the pathological gibbous curvesdo not change their character, the vertebrae being carious andwedge-shaped and ankylosed, cannot be returned to their normalcondition in so short a time. A glance at the appliances and methods show that the trend, principles and feelings of the Old School are, that they have a fighton hand, they have to conquer and subdue a stubborn enemy.These same thoughts are rampant today in the medical profession,as a doctor of mongrel breed (medicine and osteopathy mixed)says in his circular that lies before me, \"It was a stub- 231THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC born case, but we had the satisfaction of coming out of the battle victorious, having thoroughly vanquished the enemy.\" Chiropractic Orthopedy does not look upon disease or de- formities as an enemy that \"must be stamped out\" or \"vanquished,\"but as a misfortune that needs assistance. It kindly and intelligentlyhelps Innate Intelligence by removing the cause of his insane work. Orthopedic Surgery is a part of Operative Surgery, and is divided into several branches, which carry out the same idea ofconquesting and subduing, viz.: osteoclasis, fracturing of bones;osteocampsis, bending of bones that they may be made straight;osteotomy, the dividing of tendons and muscles that are drawnwith too much force, for the relief of deformity. Chiropractic Orthopedy would remove all abnormal conditions that are causing the tendons and muscles to contract with toomuch force, thereby allowing them to relax, correcting suchdiseases as rickets, Pott's disease, wry-neck, hip-joint disease andspinal curvature, removing such causes that result in neoplasm,exostoses and ankyloses. The delayed union of bones, ununited fractures, come under orthopedy. The old methods of trying to force the fragments tounite are many; the parts were resected, the articular ends spliced,temporarily secured with nails, ivory pegs, tendon or wire, then anumber of sewing needles were introduced between the fragments,hoping to irritate them in producing callus for their uniting. Otherstried exsection, uniting the ends in a staircase shape, or implantingthem in each other and then suturing. In all cases of delayed union of fragments from the lack of callus the Chiropractor finds the repair nerves that end in thatregion have been injured at the time of the accident, being pinchedby the partly occluded foramen through which they issue, therebyimpairing their usefulness. Instead of treating the effects at the fracture, he adjusts the cause, freeing the nerves so that they may act and furnish the desired callus. Dr. Lorenz' method of resetting displaced hips in children under eight years of age has been freely published through thepress. He has partly acquired one idea of Chiropractic. This\"congenital hip-disease\" has been caused by the obstetrician dis-placing the head of the femur in its socket during childbirth. Innateintelligence not being able to replace it, of necessity makes a newsocket, and by absorption does away with the one not used. Dr.Lorenz places the head of the femur in its natural position andInnate builds an acetabulum for its use. This is a great im-provement over the old method which used the knife\u2014went to theroot of the matter (?). Finding no socket for the head of the femur,a cavity was bored with a sort of auger with teeth like a saw, andthe head of the femur was put where it should have been. 232ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS The medical world has always looked upon deformities as being inherited or transmitted by such diseases as rickets, scrofula,tuberculosis and syphillis. These pathological changes are but the results from an abnormal action of mental impulses; they contribute but little evidence or elucidation to an M. D. as to thereal etiology. The theories proposed under the head of heredity furnish material for a keen satire on the medical art. To a Chiropractor such explanations do not explain. The Chiropractic Orthopedist is especially concerned with the mechanical workings of the human machine as a causative factor,in finding that its wrong working impairs its usefulness anddevelops deformities, he is enabled to adjust the displaced parts that are the cause of the disabilities and abnormalities. He is concerned, not only with the local disability called disease, but more especially with the primary cause of a lack of coordination or absence of competent physical and mental abilities. ThisChiropractic advancement has been made possible by a study ofInnate's handling of the nervous system in building and runningthe human machine. It is the purpose of The P. S. C. to emphasize this aspect of Orthopedy by creating a chair for that branch of Chiropractic.With this aim in view, we have collected in Europe and Americathe most extensive and best selected collections of orthopedicpathological specimens in the world for the elucidation of thisimportant feature of this school. It is of the greatest importance that we fully comprehend that the cause of all diseases and de-formities is in the affected, and not in our ancestors; the former we can learn to adjust, the latter never. It will be observed that Chiropractors have made great inno- vations in orthopedy by adjusting the cause of deformities insteadof treating the distortion itself. The Orthopedic surgeons conjecture that the primary cause of deformities is some one of the many diseases that they suppose tobe hereditary. The Chiropractor is able to demonstrate, in the majority of cases, that such diseased conditions as are said to be hereditary asrachitis, scrofula and tuberculosis, are curable by adjusting thecause of those conditions, which are in the individual and not outside of him. To make a success of orthopedy, we must combine manual skill with scientific knowledge of nerves, so that we may be able toadjust and put to right any displacements that cause abnormalbuilding or deformities of the thousandfold different mechanicalparts of that wonderful piece of organic clockwork\u2014 Man. Briefly, Orthopedic Surgery is that branch of Surgery which uses any one of the many forms of appliances, apparatuses, ma-chinery or mechano-therapy principles without end, for thepurpose of treating the effects. If the case is one of lateral curvature, scoliosis, the traction machines and pressure are used tostretch 233THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC from head to heel, and use forcible measures to push the curvature straight. Chiropractic Orthopedy is the adjusting, by hand, of the cause of the deformity, be it prenatal, congenital or postnatal. How much better to adjust the cause in preference to treating the effects by any one of a thousand methods. We have a counterpart to Orthopedic Surgery in the \"Modernized\" part of Chiropractic. In 1901 there was no knowledge of how to adjust the causes of prenatal, congenital andpostnatal deformities Chiropractically. Since then this school hasinvested $30,000 in selecting the best and largest osteologicalcollection in the world. It was necessary to have these to study andprecisely locate the cause. To prove a counterfeit, the genuine must be in comparison with the spurious. The imitation in this instance is very crude and showshow little depth of judgment is being used by the counterfeiter.The motive was to imitate this distinct P. S. C. Chiropractic study\u2014Chiropractic Orthopedy. Your contrivance may be a trifle different from any other; you may even have patents for it, but the fundamental principles of traction, extension and pressure are as old as Hippocrates, and, as such, are thoroughly protected by each and every \"Medical Practice Act.\" I do not object to the use of such machines by anyone if they so choose, but I do strenuously remonstrate when this special branchof surgery is called Chiropractic. It is not Chiropractic, never was, nor will be. No one knows better what Chiropractic is than theparent school. This school never has, nor will advise or teach theuse of anything but Chiropractic. If rightly understood andlearned, it needs no mixing. The very fact of additions shows the mixer's knowledge of Chiropractic is not complete. A grand jury investigation in many counties, with these facts before them, couldmake a lawsuit a great probability. Now is the time your Backbone needs fixing. Can a traction or pressure machine stretch or force these stubborn facts as a part of Chiropractic before a jury?Prosecutor's evidence is complete to start with. Each and every state has its surgical laws. Every person practicing with and using the traction, stretching or mechanicalpressure table or appliance, in any manner, is liable to that statelaw for the practice of surgery, as much so as if he had given medicine. It is an open question how far Osteopaths, in manystates, can trifle with this branch of Major Surgery. Medicine is Medicine. Surgery is Surgery. Each have their own definitions and rights which ought to be protected. A Chiropractor does not want nor need either. He does not need or intend toinfringe or trespass, be it ever so lightly, upon the ground of either. If he does, it is because he wilfully wishes to 234ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS practice deception or else knows no better. Either being sufficient cause for a practical lesson. I have confined the above quotations to men of the broadest experience, who were teachers in orthopedic science\u2014whoseworks, today, are standard. Only those portions have been utilized which deal with the following principles: 1, Traction; 2, Extension; 3, Counter- extension; 4, Suspension. More authors, in The P. S. C. library, could have been quoted, but these are sufficient to stamp it with authenticity and reliability. I will now quote from such articles and books, or describe illustrations, that will describe the mock goods, that which hasbeen attempted to tack on or splice on, as in grafting, that de-scribed above, as a part of this new science\u2014Chiropractic. The P. S. C. has been scientifically, independently, searching for the causes of deformities. The outcome is that unique study, Chiropractic Orthopedy. The advanced study of cause and art of adjustment is better than to retrace backward to the long-discardedmethods. A short description of the \"Modernized Chiropractic\" table was depicted a short time ago and will be of interest for comparisonwith the many foregoing illustrations. At the head of the table, on one side, is a wheel which is to induce traction, the feet being firmly fastened at the lower end. Along mechanical arm reaches from the side of the table over thepatient, to which is placed a vertical upright at the lower end ofwhich is a pad. This can be placed at various angles and isadjustable. The object is to use slow, steady pressure force, so asto replace \"Stubborn Seventh Cervicals.\" I would be ashamed toadmit publicly that you could not do this by hand. The P. S. C. students are taught the adjustment of every vertebra by hand. I have yet to find the vertebra or ankylosis that cannot be adjustedby hand. The table is built with a hump in it to elevate the hips, which becomes a necessity so that when pressure is applied, from aboveit, it can have play to gradually press the spine flat to the table. Thesecond picture depicts the pressure machine on both sides of theribs pressing inward endeavoring and aiming to gradually force thecurvature straight. The statement accompanying the illustration says: \"In making correction, the applicator of the anatomical adjuster is applied at the proper angle to the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra, the head is engaged in the extension device, and by slow, even, painless traction the seventh cervical is caused to resume its normal position. \"In case of lateral curvature of the spine, slow, steady traction is exerted by engaging the shoulders and feet; the anatomical 235THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC adjuster brings pressure on the angle of the ribs, and at the same time the physiological adjuster is doing its part to increase nutri-tion so that the misshaped discs of cartilage between,\" etc. Sounds like some book on orthopedy, doesn't it? This \"applicator\" is adjustable to any part of the spine. After carefully studying it and reading the above, I see no difference in principle between this method and thousands gone before. Those modes before were honorably called a part of surgery. No wonderthe deepest thinking orthopedic surgeons have discarded these threadbare methods today because of their inability to adjust cause. We are in receipt of a booklet entitled, \"The Traction Couch for Disease Treatment.\" Chiropractors do not treat disease. They adjust cause. These words are as different in meaning and application, as antipodal as a fish and a pipe organ. There were hundreds of machines designedand manufactured hundreds of years ago that, in principle, as themany above verify, are today in use, in any orthopedical hospital or supply house, for the purpose of \"Disease Treatment.\" No progress in Chiropractic has been made by this invention. It is still in the ruts. Chiropractors do not want to link hands with foreordained failure methods. \"Mechanical Construction\" of \"The Traction Couch for Disease Treatment.\" \"The body of the machine is less than four feet, and is made of steel tubing, into which the head and foot extensions telescope when folding. The head is engaged by padded straps over the forehead and at the base of the occiput. Shoulders rest upon strap support and are engaged by the curved crutch-like fastenings, passing under the armpits. The feet are secured by hooks and straps, giving a direct pull down the long bones of the leg. \"Traction is applied by the lever at the side which controls the bevel-geared mechanism, driving the ends of the machine outward, separating the body. \"The stretch is graduated along the body; can be applied to the limbs alone, from shoulder to feet, from head to feet, and in most any way desirable.\" Compare this with the many descriptions gone before and see if \"It is the only thing of the kind in the world.\" \"Among Chiropractors there has been a constant demand for this machine.\" Students receiving their knowledge of Chiropractic first-handed, at the parent school, have no need nor fear that adjuncts will be pawned upon you. Machines sold are to pseudo-\"Chiros\" and not to those who have studied specific, pure and unadulterated Chiropractic at the parent school. \"To the profession of Chiropractic especially the value of traction in the production of spinal extensions and muscular re- 236ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS laxation in the producing of subluxations, adjusting skeletal de- rangements, and relieving nerve impingement will be most appar-ent.\" Methinks the \"nerve impingement\" is mostly in \"relieving\"the pinched condition of pockets more than anything else. Chiro- practic and surgery mixed has not drawn business. The \"value of traction\" is according to how little you know of Chiropractic. Ihave yet to see the orthopedical machine or apparatus made, usingfor its principle traction, or gradual pressure, that is one cent'svalue to a Chiropractor who is thorough in his knowledge. \"In the armamentarium of every Chiropractor 'the old medical idea was, and still is, with all that cling to the 'treatment' ofdisease,\" that it is an enemy that must be fought, driven out withall devilish arms, poisons and unmerciful machines that can beoriginated or invented. The more stubborn the disease, the strongerand meaner must the driver be. The honest Chiropractor knowsthat subluxation is a thing accidentally received, as such, sympathyand practical assistance should be extended instead of conjuringsome machine that will make the intruder flee. Why try to dragforth ideas that progressive orthopedists are discarding? Leavethem stay where experience says they belong. This article willopen wider the breach of investigation. Can you withstand theshocks that are tearing holes in your walls? The following letter is one of many on this subject received at this school: \"I am suffering with a growing out of the spine, 8th, 9th 10th dorsal vertebrae, which was brought on by heavy straining work,the weight falling about this part of the back. Have been sufferingabout three years; have worn different forms of braces, includingthe Philo Burt brace, but all with but little or no permanent benefit.Have also taken osteopathic treatment. They cannot do anythingfor me with their method.\" I answered, telling him if a normal, straight spine was what he wanted, to come, we would fix it. I explained to him that the cause was what had not as yet been adjusted. To make this or any otherperson well you must find the cause and then correct it, a thing all P. S. C. students, since the advent of Chiropractic Orthopedy, cando, will accomplish that which the entire past with its racks oftorture have failed on. True, there is more temporary money to invent a machine where the patient can be treated from two to five years. This is given as the average time by men who certainly know. Moremoney in it to treat effects than to adjust cause. The school thatgives permanent results is the one that continues to increase its business. These little points of honor to a science are carefullyfigured by prospective students. Another article by a Chiropractor states: \"Perfectly understood and practiced, this idea can be used at any time or place, for nomechanical adjuncts are necessary in adjusting the spine, 237THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC and those who use them have simply halted by the way. All the mechanical laws are employed in the workings of the body, and the hands can set them at work to correct mechanical derangements.\" Would you like to attend school where you had to study orthopedic surgery, called \"Modernized Chiropractic,\" and thenascertain, when in practice, that you couldn't use it, for fear ofarrest for practicing surgery? Evidence would be conclusive. Sixty volumes on this subject in The P. S. C. library is at the disposal of any county attorney that wants to prove to a jury what traction,extension and pressure are and how applied. The injustice to Chiropractic is what I will see corrected. A teacher cannot teach what he has not got the wherewith to teach with. It is impossible to teach Chiropractic Orthopedy without the use of an immense osteological collection. The traction couch is the substitution. The success of The P.S.C. has proven that first-handed, genuine, pure goods, the kind without substitutions or counterfeits,are the kind asked for. The P.S.C. as a school is properly and thoroughly equipped and prepared to demonstrate and teachChiropractic Orthopedy\u2014the correction of the cause of deformities. To sum up, let us see some of the differences: The P. S. C. has the doughnut\u2014these men see the hole. Chiropractic adjustment has for its application a quick, energetic, piano, or typewriter movement. Orthopedic books advise the use of steady, gradually increasing, mechanical force. Chiropractic means hand fixing. The application of any form of machinery is distinctly Orthopedic Surgery. One contradicts theother. The two together is impossible except to he who knows butlittle of either. The legal pill awaits he who will not learn.Chiropractic personifies and teaches life. Surgery representsstagnation or constipation. Do you need a pill? The legal machinewill come your way, sooner or later, if you need it. Chiropractic is eminently successful in adjusting the cause of these deformities, which was not, nor is today, thought of by medical men. Orthopedical appliances and all its principles aimonly to treat the effects, thereby making continual dismal failures. Orthopedic surgery is cruel, inhuman, torture, savage, bar- barous, pitiless, unrelenting, hard-hearted, inexorable, harsh.Chiropractic assists Innate by adjusting the cause, thus is humane,forbearing, merciful, benevolent and beneficent. Chiropractic is the product of today. Orthopedic surgery appliances of this counterfeit type are traceable to Hippocrates,time (460 B.C.). One is distinctly Chiropractic, the other \"Chiropractic Modernized\" backwards. 238ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Orthopedic surgery, as it stands today, represents the trials, troubles and tribulations of hundreds of men's minds and millionsof dollars in experimenting to treat the effects. Chiropractic showsthe exact science of adjusting the true cause of disease. Conclusion\u2014 Chiropractic Orthopedy, from a \"Modernized Chiropractic\" viewpoint, would be like asking a German band toplay pipe organ music; get lake white fish from a muddy river; atypesetter to build a boat; for butter and get oleomargarine; for lardand get cottolene. Would be like goingTo the Rocky Mountains for water lilies.To Alaska for oranges and bananas.To Great Salt Lake for fresh water drink.To Central Africa for the latest Parisian styles.To the North Pole for steam heat.To Iceland for watermelons.To the Equator for a skating party.To the South Sea Islands for Boston culture.To an Indian camp for musical instruction, asking for Chiro- practic, but getting a crude counterfeit, \"Chiropractic Modern- ized.\" will you have? Does Swindling Pay? In Bishop's \"Deformities of the Human Body\" we have another authority who denounces the brutal treatment of machinery fordeformities of the body. In considering the entire body and its mechanical treatment, he says: \"Hence we have a multitude of machines invented for thepurpose of doing what they have never accomplished, in cases inwhich the mechanism needed might have been found in the bodyitself. \"Under these circumstances we need not be surprised that mechanism constructed in imitation of the rack, gallows, andsundry other combinations of mechanical powers, have been re-sorted to and applied to cure distortions, and are not only recom-mended, but actually used to this day, both in this country andabroad. \"The practice of stretching the trunk in curvatures of the spine has been more or less adopted in Germany, France and England,and is still in constant use. \"In order to replace the vertebrae, he (Pare) recommends that the patient be laid on a table, with his face downwards; he is thento be bound by passing towels tightly under the arms and aroundthe thighs, the ends being left free, so as to be held by twoassistants, one placed at the head, the other at the feet. \"Such were the views and the methods employed by Pare to restore the figure of the back.\" Chiropractors, with the muchparaded Dvorsky method, are behind the times. The towel pushingis hundreds of years old. Why not \"Modernize somethingpractical?\" 239THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC \"It is not the principal object of the author of these pages to direct especial attention to the details of the particular means employed in stretching the body, but to the ends aimed at by the surgeons who employed them; not to what machinery is used, but why it is used, not to how the body is stretched, but why and with what results. If an examination be made into the effects of extending the body in the axis of its length with the view of correcting distortions of the spine, it will not be very difficult todemonstrate, in the first place, that it can never effect the object sought; and secondly, that the practice is not merely insufficient, but absolutely injurious. \"Extension cannot effect a cure when the bones of the spine have assumed a wedge-like shape. It is clear that the extendingprinciple must be altogether useless, to say nothing of the con-finement, torment, and loss of health occasioned by this plan oftreatment. Practitioners who pursue the extension system areprobably little aware of the great amount of force necessary toaccomplish its end, and the injurious consequences of force whenapplied to the soft parts. \"Sir Benjamin Brodie observes that no machinery ought ever to be employed for the purpose of elongating the spine and correctingdeformity. There are, however, practitioners in the present daywho make use of powerful machines, capable of overcomingankylosed union of the diseased parts of the vertebral column; andit is reported that life has been sometimes sacrificed in the attempt. \"The author has simply, in this work attempted to trace to their sources the failure of the various methods in use\u2014to expose theempirical state of the practice abroad and at home,\u2014and to laydown some rules founded on established premises as guides forfuture treatment. When we take a survey of the vile machines thathave been invented, and considered the amount of torture inflictedby them for no useful end, that patients have been subjected, oftenfor years, to painful restraint, have incurred expense, and lostmuch precious time, all which has been borne with fortitude by theyoung and delicate, buoyed up by the fallacious hope of a happyresult; and that muscles and tendons have been cut, and variousmutilations inflicted on a mechanism so beautiful and so perfect asthat of the human body in order to attain objects which such meanscould never accomplish,\u2014it must be acknowledged that thisbranch of surgery is in a most deplorable state. Almost everyorthopedic practitioner has hitherto employed some favoritemachine for the treatment of distortions. The author does notintend to propose any new machinery, either for stretching,pulling, pushing or propping the body; his aim being to dispel theillusion that such machines possess any value, but demonstratingtheir inefficiency in the majority of cases.\" More authors could be added. The above is an authority and broadly quoted for the reliableness and thoroughness of decision.His clinical advantages have been large. 240ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Incompetent Chiropractors try to tack the above unproven conglomeration and advertise it as a part of Chiropractic. Theirknowledge of the latter is minus and largely constricted, thusswindling people, making them think they are getting Chiropractic.Does swindling pay? If you are in doubt as to the standing ofanyone, correspond with The P. S. C. and find out before spending time, money and effort to condemn Chiropractic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 DOES EDUCATION PREVENT DISEASE ? \"Can the Innate or Educated mind be educated so as to ward off disease?\" is a question we are often asked. The Innate mind represents the addition of generation after generation of thoughts stored away. Our educated brain is capableof expressing a portion of Innate in voluntary form; that is, at thecommand of our external man, and is the expansion that takesplace from birth to death. Take as an illustration any well educatedman. You look upon him as a person who uses good, clearjudgment, who goes to the bottom of any investigation or matterpresented. You consider him a most typical virile individual. His Innate was educated before he was physically born; his intellectual brain has been educated at many schools and colleges,and has been sharpened by the brightest wits in the United StatesSenate and House of Representatives. Although he represents onetype of the greatest men of today, he might have a slip upon thecurbing\u2014subluxation follows and he is as liable to haverheumatism as an everyday laborer. The king in his castle is nomore exempt than the poorest renter. Professor Harper, Presidentof Chicago University, having, at his beck and call, the greatestuniversity in America, was subject to a vertebral subluxation thatproduced cancer (a disease not considered \"incurable\" by theChiropractor, because he knows cause), the simple cause, notbeing known to the entire medical profession, his death occurred incommon with many poor sufferers. His mental education did notmake him, physically, any higher. Innate is no respecter of circumstance\u2014regardless of person, nation, color or sex, and will maintain an equilibrium if given achance\u2014minus impediments. Chiropractors cannot dictate to Innate\u2014nor do they need to. The man who is treating effects needs to try everything\u2014any- thing\u2014that offers a substance of a shadow of a health returned but,on the reverse, considers her our superior. Her advice is given fullsway, by adjusting that which is an impediment or obstruction inher path. When this is accomplished, \"Nature,\" \"Instinct,\"\"Subconscious Mind,\" \"Vitality\" will be but acting normally\u2014Health. 241THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC FALLACIES. (Lecture delivered by L. H. Nutting at the Universal Chiro- practors, Association meeting.) Having spent days and hours in trying to ascertain the reason why your program committee invited me to read a paper beforethis association, I have become convinced that being an outsider,you expect me to give you the situation as viewed by such; and totell you why Chiropractic is not the established mode of removingconditions that produce pain and disease. The American peoplehave this one lesson to learn, and it must be indelibly impressed ontheir minds, never to be effaced. Disease is not a misfortune, butwillful ignorance and death, except from an accident, is, literallyspeaking, committing suicide by the slow poison process for thebenefit of your medical family physician. Chiropractic has not yet become fashionable. The American people are \"faddists,\" to go to a Chiropractor and have acutediseased conditions removed in twenty-four to forty-eight hours isentirely too tame for them. It does not consist of enough notorietyto suit the average mortal. A person who is ill and suffering painwants some notoriety as a recompense, and the more the better. They want an ambulance to call at the house, take them to some hospital, want the whole neighborhood aroused, standing aroundwith long faces and tear-dimmed eyes, and drive away when theemotion has reached the meridian, even if they have to return thenext day in a hearse, when they will again be the recipients of thesympathy of their friends and neighbors, and with pomp and styleproceed to the cemetery enshrined with the choicest flowers. I saythey prefer this rather than to be guilty of going to the Chiropractoror call him to their home and live without the notoriety. It is too economical to suit the style and tone of the present age and generation. Who would have the temerity to relate to theircircle of friends that they had the conditions removed thatproduced cancerous growths, rheumatism or tuberculosis for $40or $50, and at home? The very idea! This is only enough to pay therailroad fare to some high-toned sanitarium, to say nothing of theboard and room, nurse fees and medical attendance and drugs.Why, anybody with only an ordinary amount of common sensewould know at once it is impossible. The public verdict is, thatthey never had any of these diseases; of course not; and are soassured by their family physician. If your Chiropractic adjustments were attended with dangerous results to the patients you adjust, your infirmary would be crowdedto overflowing and you would have to turn patients away daily. It is entirely too simple for those persons who imagine that disease is caused by a bunch of microbes sent from heaven or 242ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS some mysterious place and that a doctor has to be clothed with supernatural power in order to be able to relieve them. A patient comes to you suffering from diseased conditions, you examine them, and after analyzing the case, your experience hastaught you that you can give immediate relief, and you are surethat you can, in a short period of time, restore them to normalcondition, and you tell the patient: \"Yes, we have had cases of thiskind before; no doubt, with a few adjustments, you will gain yournormal health.\" The patient is surprised and looks with thatexpression of disappointment on his or her face, and mentallyexclaims, \"Is this all there is to it ? I have been told that I was in aprecarious condition.\" A medical M. D. would say, with tears inhis eyes, that your case \"is a very serious one and the chances foryour recovery are extremely few. I hardly think I can give you anyrelief without a surgical operation, but if you refuse to go to theoperating table, I will do what I can for you with the counsel oftwo or more doctors who know just as much as I do and may, aftertwo or three months, be able to relieve you of pain, but you cannever expect to be well again.\" The patient is impressed with this doctor's brilliant knowledge and they make up their minds that the doctor is right; they knowthat they are sick and in pain, and are glad that the doctor knewsomething of their conditions. Then they wonder why it is thatthese \"fakirs\" are allowed to put their opinion against the judgmentof a regular full-fledged medical student who has spent three to sixyears in some medical college. But here is the oppositeproposition: Your telephone calls and you are summoned to acottage on the hillside, where lies in agony the breadwinner of thefamily. He cannot afford this gush and display of calling the chiefdrug dispenser, and he pleads with you to help him, so he canassume his duty in earning bread for his family. Here is youropportunity. Get a fine ambulance, drawn by not less than fourstylish caparisoned horses, have this outfit decked in holiday attire,with flags and banners containing appropriate Chiropracticmottoes. Let the public know that this is no funeral on cortegebent. That you are rejoicing with joy that you have been given anopportunity to save a human life. Go after him daily, and after his adjustment and the necessary rest, send him home and instruct your driver to take a differentroute each and every trip. Keep it up every day, if it takes weeks ormonths, until this man is well. The longer you are at it the moreplaces your ambulance will have to call. One more and I am done. Do nothing by halves, never take a case unless you are absolutely sure of relieving. The few dollarsyou may get for adjusting a patient without giving relief will costyou $5.00 for every one you get. Be sure in each case, and whenyou commence, never give up, and insist that the patient remainwith you until well. The Science of Chiropractic has had this for a hard and tedious voyage. You started out to cross the river of experience 243THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC with no gaily bedecked steamers, with no bands of music, but in a flat boat without sail or rudder, with poles and sticks such as youhad at your command; you pushed your way against the rushingcurrent of adversity. You have reached the shore and have wadedwaist deep through the mud and mire of the swamp ofdespondency. You are now in the peaceful valley among the treesand flowers, all ready and fully equipped to commence the ascentof the hill to success. Let your deliberation be of such importancethat in the ascent you will make no false slips, but will climbslowly and surely until you reach the top. There unfurl your bannerto the world, emblazoned on its folds in letters of gold, \"To Chiropractic belongs the honor of discovering the fountain ofyouth.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 CHIROPRACTIC\u2014ITS SUCCESS. (Toast delivered by \"Uncle Howard\" Nutting at the banquet given by The Universal Chiropractors' Association at Turner Hall, Wednesday, September 19, 1906.) \"I can see my finish, your presiding officer is determined to force me to intrude on your time and patience until I lose youresteem, if I ever had it. But as there is no escape for me, except toplay the part of a coward, I am going at it to the best of my ability. \"Ever since the beginning of time it has been the custom after great and glorious achievements, following the accomplishment ofany difficult work, where the victory was good to the public, it hasbeen celebrated by the successful contestants by feasting andmerry-making. \"So you have completed the organization of The Universal Chiropractors' Association, are celebrating the consummation herein our beautiful city of Davenport, around this banquet table. Youhave accomplished a grand and noble work. You are not bandedtogether for the purpose of monopolizing the art of removing theconditions that produce pain and disease, but you are joined in thisunselfish brotherhood for the sole purpose of alleviating pain andsuffering, for bringing back the glow of health to the pallid face.To lift the fallen, assist the weak, and to battle with the strong, tocrush and demolish the monopoly now holding the lives ofsuffering humanity in their avaricious hands, to do or die as they shall dictate. Your interests are one and identical. You will hereafter be as one large family of brothers and sisters, theoffspring of \"Dad Chiro.\" You will not only watch the interests ofeach other with jealous care, but will protect each other againstany power that can possibly be brought to bear; your methods ofproceeding are, no doubt, mapped out at this convention, and Iwould not presume to undertake to suggest to you any path you are to follow. 244ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS I will say, however, that there are paths which you must shun if you would be successful: These are Allo path, Homeopath and Osteopath. They are all paths that are being deserted by the scientific, philosophical, progressive, thinking men and women.These paths I have mentioned wind in and out, around and throughtangled and poisonous vines and bushes of thorns, over yawningchasms and around the corners of jagged rocks and under greattrees where lurks the venomous moccasin, where grows the poisonivy and hangs suspended the huge boa constrictor; and fortunate ishe who makes the journey of either path, who comes out into the sunshine of the peaceful valley of health without carrying theunsightly scars of lacerated and wounded flesh caused by thethorns and keen-edged stones, or, with drawn, pinched face andexpressionless eyes, the effects of the poison encountered, or atwisted and deformed body by the coils of the boa constrictor. Wesee in our daily press, every day, victims of these enemies ofhuman life and happiness, who have been following these paths for years, who persist in this dangerous habit. What is there sofascinating around and about these dangerous paths, to say nothingof the odors they encounter in their way? What is it? This is theproblem you, as an association, will have to solve, and then takemeasures to break the spell that holds such an influence over them. Do you ask for a suggestion as to the possible reason? It is a lack of stamina and will power; they need a Chiropracticadjustment, so they will be brave enough to face the music. They are in the same predicament of a lady I once knew, but who since taking a few adjustments had changed materially. Shewould not go in the street because she did not have a hat of thelatest fashion; she feared the taunts and sneers of those who hadthe necessary to procure the hat in season and pay for it after theseason was over. So it is with the person I have mentioned; theycan wind around the various paths, their friends sympathize withthem and share the grief and pain, and pay for the enjoyment attheir leisure. They are afraid to pay cash for their ticket on the Chiropractor's overland special, which runs through fragrantfields, by babbling brooks and crystal springs, where they can ridequickly, easily and comfortably to the beautiful city of health, atthe rate of sixty miles an hour, because they would miss all theenjoyable features of disease and grief they encounter by the otherroute. I am a firm believer in the principles of Chiropractic. I am very peculiar in that I never accept anything as a fact without duedeliberation and consideration, in the slang of the day, \" You have to show me.\" I visited the infirmary at Second and Brady street in this city the first time, on the invitation of \"Dad Chiro,\" to see some friends who had written me concerning the merits ofChiropractic. I answered them, that I condemned nothing withoutinvestigation. They came, were taking adjustments, and 245THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC were ashamed to even let me know that they were here. I re- member, especially, A. T. Rayburn, from Montezuma, Ia., a cousinof Mrs. Nutting, who was here three clays before myself or wifeknew of it. After the third adjustment he was brave enough to showhimself at our home. I asked him what was the method employed.He answered, \"I know not, all I know is that night before last is thefirst time I have been able to lie down and sleep since the Civilwar.\" This was wonderful, and I commenced to keep tab on thepatients, saw them come and go, in wheel chairs, on crutches, andthen see them going to the depot to return blithe and gay, with thefirm and rapid stride, the picture of health and happiness. I have been shown, and I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that any conditions that cannot be removed by the science ofChiropractic, cannot, and never will, be removed. I have known cases, under by own observation, where a party only took a fewadjustments, was influenced by outside forces to desist, that theeffects of those adjustments became discernible after six monthshas elapsed and the party recovered. I have watched the progressof this science through all the dark and gloomy days which it haspassed and have done all in my power, and when needed, I shallever be found putting forth my best efforts for this science, not forglory, honor or pecuniary compensation, but for love and sympathyfor my fellow man. If what I have said or done, or what I am ableto do in the future, will be the means of saving one life oralleviating the pain of one sufferer I am satisfied. I am not afraid,the opposition have exploded their shells and I fear not their emptyguns. I shall continue to stand for Chiropractic as long as I mayhave health and strength; and when this fails, I will call on B. J.Palmer and go at it again. May you all be eminently successful inyour chosen vocation and be assured that you will always have onefriend outside of your association, is my best wish. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 ANATOMIES VERSUS CHIROPRACTIC. We are all well aware that the teachings of medical books are not that of Chiropractic. Samuel Cooper says on page 354: \"Every kind of joint is not equally liable to dislocations. Experience proves, indeed, that inthe greater part of the vertebral column luxations are absolutelyimpossible, the pieces of bone being articulated by extensive,numerous surfaces, varying in their form and direction, and so tiedtogether by many powerful elastic means, that very little motion isallowed. Experience proves, also, that the strength of thearticulations of the pelvic bones can scarcely be affected byenormous efforts, unless these bones be simultaneously fractured.\" 246ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS On page 365: \"The large surfaces with which these bones support each other; the number and thickness of their ligaments;the strength of their muscles; the little degree of motion whicheach vertebra naturally has, and the vertical direction of thearticular processes, make dislocations of the dorsal vertebra im-possible, unless there be also a fracture of the above mentionedprocesses. Of these cases I shall merely remark that they can onlyresult from immense violence, that the symptoms would be anirregularity in the disposition of the spinous processes, retention orcontinence of the urine or faeces, paralysis and a motionless stateof the lower extremities, the effects of the pressure, or other injury,to which the spinal marrow would be subjected. Similar symptomsmay also arise when the spinal marrow has merely undergone aviolent concussion, without any fracture or dislocation whatever;and it is certain that most of the cases mentioned by authors asdislocations of the lumbar and dorsal vertebrae have only beenconcussions of the spinal marrow, or fractures of such bones.\" \"The os occipitis and first cervical vertebrae are so firmly connected by ligaments that there is no instance of their beingluxated from an external cause, and were the accident to happen, itwould immediately prove fatal by the unavoidable compressionand injury of the spinal marrow.\" J. L. Petit mentions a case of a child being instantly killed by being lifted by the head. C. Bell relates a case and remarks: \"Patients can hardly be expected to survive mischief of this kind, when the transverseligament is broken and the process dentatus is thrown directlybackward against the medulla oblongata, the effect must be instantdeath.\" A. Cooper remarks: \"In the spine the motion between any two bones is so small that dislocation hardly ever occurs, exceptbetween the first and second vertebrae, although the bones areoften displaced by fracture.\" Kirkland observes: \"There are some luxations which are far worse injuries than fractures; of this description are dislocations ofthe vertebrae, cases which indeed can hardly happen withoutfracture, and are almost always fatal.\" Stimson says: \"The possibility of the occurrence of pure dislocation of the lumbar vertebrae, which has long been in doubt,because of the close interlocking of the processes and the strengthof the ligaments, is proved by two cases collected by Blasius andalso by two others, in which there was present associated, butunimportant, fractures of some of the processes.\" This same author speaking of dislocation of the atlas from the axis, says : \"Dislocation forward or backward is possible only afterfracture of the odontoid process or rupture of the transverseligament, or by slipping of the process beneath the ligament.\" 247THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Gerrish su ms up this question by saying: \"Simple dislocation between two vertebrae is, therefore, almost impossible, unless,perhaps, in the cervical region, where the surfaces of the articularprocesses are more nearly horizontal.\" Gray asserts, under the head of surgical anatomy, \"The liga- ments which unite the component parts of the vertebrae togetherare so strong, and these bones are so interlocked by the arrange-ment of their articulating processes, that dislocation is very un-common and, indeed, unless accompanied by fracture, rarelyoccurs, except in the upper part of the neck. Dislocation of theoccipit from the atlas has only been recorded in one or two cases;but dislocation of the atlas from the axis, with rupture of thetransverse ligament is much more common; it is the mode in whichdeath is produced in many cases of execution by hanging. In thelower part of the neck\u2014that is, below the third cervical vertebra\u2014dislocation unattended by fracture occasionally takes place.\" These medical writers refer to complete luxations of the vertebral column\u2014they know of no other. Such rarely occurwithout fracture, and instant death is the result. In this we fullyagree. A Chiropractic subluxation is where the articular surfaces of any one of the fifty-one spinal joints have been partially displaced,and not usually accompanied with fracture. The replacing of thesesubluxated vertebrae is an easy operation for a Chiropractor. Whenwe refer to luxations of the spine, we speak of those which havebeen only partially displaced. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 MOTOR-SENSORY OR AFFERENT-EFFERENT NERVOUS SYSTEM? A new foundation and superstructure has made Chiropractic what it is today\u2014a distinct science. To supply this new buildingmeant a new nomenclature, those which were in accordance withits teachings\u2014no \"twaddle\" for The P. S. C. M. D. and D. O. terms are superstitious. The terms \"sensory\" and \"motor,\" when applied to nerves, have been used to state the function. Motor nerves have no motion, butimpulse, passing through them, acts upon the tissue cell, meaningthe continuance of molecular change. That which creates animpression upon the peripheral of an afferent nerve fibre is not\"sensation\" until so interpreted by mind. The nerves sense nothing,therefore, are not \"sensory.\" Paralysis represents the impediment to brain motor impulses, not a nerve paralyzed, but its inability to convey that which makesmotion. In abnormal \"sensation\" the ability of nerves to receiveimpressions is not destroyed, but its control in being able to deliverthem to brain is minus. 248ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS These words are misnomers and were named before their functions were intelligently understood. That which nerves carry is \"sensory\" or \"motor\" in expression, but they are an Efferent and Afferent Nervous system. \"Sensory\"and \"motor\" is what they convey when interpreted or expressed. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 MEDULLATED AND NON-MEDULLATED NERVES. Two brains control functions of the body. Each has its set of nerve fibres. The set which expresses the Educated mind iscovered by white tissue, fatty in consistency\u2014the medullarysheath. This shield is an insulator in function. The Innate voluntary brain has no fibres sheathed. The discrimination is to avoid crossed wires or intermingling of im-pulses. The various functions, representing impulses of each brain, cannot short circuit within itself, yet either could or would in-termingle with those of the opposite. Innate, during foetal de-velopment, sheaths the fibres of the smaller bundle, thus usingdiscerning and economic principles. Although brief, the above is the first article which has offered logical reason why the Innate body builder provided one set with sheaths and the opposite not. To state (as the M. D.'s and D. O.'sdo) that these are the result of \"reflex action\" or \"sympatheticresults\" does not intelligently attain the level of the wisdomperformed. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 LEADERS OR FOLLOWERS. Like almost every other subject the one allotted to me for comment and elucidation has a number of viewpoints from whichit might be considered. In fact, it fairly bristles with them. If givento a young man between twenty and thirty years of age, of steadyhabits, fond of domestic life, and especially if presented to hisattention in the spring, when, as Tennyson has so trippinglyexpressed it, \"A young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts oflove\"\u2014such a young man, like some of my fellow students, whosenames or numbers I could mention, would naturally and blame-lessly contemplate it from the viewpoint of matrimony. The burning question with him would be, \"Which of the two positions, leader or follower, will I necessarily occupy after themarriage vows have been spoken?\" \"Will I lead, or follow, in all ofthe affairs of life which will thereafter revolve about the domestichearthstone?\" \"Which position will bring about the greatestsuccess and most happiness to both of us after the minister hasmade us one\u2014I, of course, being the one?\" 249THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC This is, indeed, a serious question, and one demanding much thought and consideration. If this young man were only in a stateof mind that would permit him to take friendly and sincere advice,I would like to suggest (leaving my own experience wholly out ofconsideration, and basing my opinion entirely upon theopportunities for observation that I have been afforded by nearlyforty years of professional life) that he may very masterfully leadthe lady of his choice to the altar, but after this exhibition of hisgeneralship, it will take more tact, skill and strategy than theaverage man possesses to enable him to maintain the perilousposition he has placed himself in. Why ? Because his better half,previous to the marriage ceremony, has been revolving the verysame questions in her own mind, and has reached a conclusionwhich it is unnecessary for me to state before such an intelligentaudience as I see before me. I might go on indefinitely, mentioning the particular view of my subject that would be taken by the scientist, the philanthropist,statesman, minister or physician, in short, the personal view of therepresentatives of every class and condition of mankind, but itwould end only in the discovery that all men from necessity areeither leaders or followers. Which class each one selects toaffiliate with depends altogether upon his hopes, ambitions andenvironment. Man's ambitions too often override his judgment and lead him to pose as a leader, when, in fact, his qualifications, at best, fit himonly for a follower and a very indifferent one at that. But hismistake is soon discovered either by himself or by his friends,because genuine leaders, like poets, are born and not made. On account of the conspicuousness that attends brilliant leadership, many thoughtlessly conclude that the position of afollower is much inferior to that of a leader. But this is a greatmistake. To insure the successful issue of every worthy endeavor,followers are as necessary to leaders as the main body of an armyis to the advanced division which has captured a strategic pointfrom the enemy which must be held at all hazards to make thevictory complete. The only real difference between a successful leader and a worthy follower is that the former is especially qualified by mentalendowment to make original investigations and discoveries, whilethe latter is better fitted for maintaining and propagating the newlydiscovered truths in all of their original purity. Without theirhearty co-operation the roughly outlined gem of a new truth wouldnever be discovered, extracted from the bed of ignorance, falsity orsuperstition in which it lies. Cut and trimmed by the sharp tools ofcriticism and debate, polished by the hard whirl of practical useand experience and, finally, placed in its appropriate niche in thegalaxy of sister truths, which have been rescued and preserved in asimilar manner. Mind you, I am 250ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS speaking now of only the genuine type of leaders and followers. I am painfully aware that there are false and incompetent leadersand unworthy and vacillating followers. There are leaders who area detriment and handicap to every cause they espouse and there arefollowers whose support, in time of need, is of no more value tothe cause they claim to represent than is a broken rudder to a shipin the path of a storm. But what of Chiropractic, the youngest and handsomest child of the household, who is forging ahead with such long and rapidstrides that he has already excited the envy of the young membersof this illustrious family and filled the minds of the older ones withfear and consternation? It is not necessary to possess the mental acumen of a Sherlock Holmes to determine where his rightful position is. Look at thislusty youth! Watch his motions! See how free and energetic theyare! Observe his spinal column! Verily, it is a thing of beauty and ajoy forever. It exhibits no abnormal curves; there are nosubluxations to interfere with the full, free and forcefulexpressions of his Innate Intelligence, neither is he handicapped byerroneous and useless ideas derived from \"Educated Foolishness.\"He evidently is not only a born leader of the truest and strongesttype, whom it is an honor to follow, but one who possessesphysical and mental qualities which will enable him to maintainhis exalted position indefinitely against all aspiring rivals. But, although he will never be dethroned, to enable him to accomplish results that are at all commensurate with his ability, heneeds the support and assistance of intelligent, strong, willing andearnest followers and the more of them the better. There can neverbe so many that he will be unable to provide a place of trust,responsibility and honor for each and every one. This zealous and ever growing band of followers must be comprised of the graduates of The P. S. C. and other recognized schools, as they not only thoroughly understand what constitutesthe basic principles of pure, unadulterated Chiropractic, butpossess the knowledge, skill and aggressiveness to prevent themeither from being stolen by jealous rivals or from being con-taminated by the interjection of false and erroneous ideas. In conclusion, I feel that it is neither an idle boast nor an exaggeration of the truth to say that, without question, Chiropracticis already not only the leader in all of the essentials of the lifescience, but that it is supplied with enough germinal vesicles toenable it to hold this advanced position until physicians of allschools acknowledge its supremacy. How soon this medical millennium will appear will depend upon the harmony and unity of aim and purpose which is displayedby its qualified, representative followers. For a leader there couldbe none better adapted to fill that distinguished and arduousposition than the one who now occupies it. 251THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Next to an ideal leader the most important thing is a united band of followers who, in turn, also become leaders to the extentthat, by argument and demonstration, they are able to convincethose with whom they come in contact with the truths and justiceof their cause. In all successful reforms and movements the followers seem to be imbued with the same intrepid and indomitable spirit which isexhibited by their leader, and my observations convince me that allgenuine Chiros are no exception in this respect. In all references to the elements which are depended upon to support and advance Chiropractic, there is a very important one, inmy estimation, which I have not heard mentioned. This is the silent but powerful vote from the casting of which no American citizen will ever be deprived. Don't neglect to exertevery legitimate effort to secure its influence. It is the mostdesirable ally you can possess. At the crucial moment, when theinterests of Chiropractic are threatened by adverse legislation, itwill be of more value than gold and more persuasive than the \"manbehind the gun.\" There are only two sources which can supply this much needed one and that is the converted Chiropractor who knows byexperience the value of Chiropractic methods and the truth of itsclaims. While the supply of votes from this source is reliable andsteady, it is small compared to that it is possible to derive from thatother source\u2014the lay public\u2014the people who have never heard ofthis new science, but who will give it their support as soon as theycan be made to understand it. The laity, as never before, are intensely interested in all matters pertaining to health and the removal of the cause of disease. Theproof of this statement is found in the great number of healthjournals, good, bad and indifferent, which are subscribed for andread by all classes of people in every state and community. Read,did I say\u2014yes, read, and this is the best part of it, for it furnishes the cue for us to go on and feed their hungry minds with thekernels and grains of fresh, new truth in place of the empty chaffwhich most of them are now receiving. We must inaugurate a campaign of popular education and let the people everywhere know what Chiropractic really is and whatit can do. You must write and explain and continue to write andexplain until the principles of this science are thoroughlycomprehended. If you cannot gain access to the pages of periodicals already published you must start one or more of your own, but it must beof a purely educational and philosophical character, from which allcontroversy is eliminated. If this is done I am sure the effort willbe successful and the reward, in the form of a rapidly increasingnumber of sincere disciples and adherents will be great. G. H. PATCHEN. M. D. 252ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS WHAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CHIROPRACTIC. Lecture delivered by \"Uncle Howard\" Nutting at The P. S. C.: I have not the slightest idea what subjects you wish me to express, much less what you expect me to say. If you desire that Itell you what I know about Chiropractic, and I am well aware that this subject is uppermost in your minds, I can express it in threewords: \"It is it.\" (Applause.) If you are listening for me to tell what I do not know of this science, that is another proposition, and I venture that there is not a person in this lecture room, notexcepting your learned teacher, who probably is as well versed onthis subject as any one in the world, who can tell what he or shedoes not know of Chiropractic in a week by talking glibly ten hours a day. (Laughter.) You are acquainted with the basic principles of this science and it may seem that there is little more to learn, but let us reason andconsider that you are yet on the back pages of the primer.Comparatively speaking, you are able to spell and pronouncewords of one or two syllables and, like a child thus far advanced,are able to carry on quite a conversation and convey ideas inwords, sufficient for his needs ; so you, by the knowledge you haveacquired, are able to relieve a vast amount of suffering andperform many wonderful deeds. I am aware and pleased to note that the science has made great advancement in the last two or three years, but to the outsider, suchas I, it seems clear that you are yet far from the apex of knowledgeof the greatest and most wonderful science. It is probable that youare farther advanced than the public has knowledge of; if so, what Isay will be received with smiles and derision, but if I am behind inyour advancement what must be the status of the public, who havenever heard a lecture or investigated the subject at all? Let us see where we are at. Can you analyze the cable of nerves issuing from the spine through one foramina of the vertebralcolumn ? Have you the ability to show by a diagram wherein eachcable of nerves are locating the different systems, viz.: motor,sensory, calorific and all other strands ? Can you tell by thecharacter of a subluxation which system is impinged without tracing from the diseased condition at the extremity of those nervefibres ? Will you explain, by examination of the atlas, whether ornot the individual is insane and if so, what part of the brain is anabnormal condition, thereby proclaiming what line of thought isirrational? Can you successfully determine, by examination of any sub- luxation, the nature or stage of condition existing at the termina-tion of nerve fibres passing through the foramina at this point? Canyou to a certainty, determine by examination of the vertebralcolumn, whether or not the subject is suffering from tetanus 253THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC without other evidence? Can you successfully demonstrate, by examination of the vertebral column, whether or not the subject issuffering pain, or locate the part diseased solely by this? Can youread the vertebral column like a book, locating in each and everyinstance the diseased conditions, where located, and the stage ofthese conditions ? Would you undertake such a task and swear by it in any single instance in any one of the many cables of nerves issuing from any one of the foramina? Can you explain why swine are subject to all diseased conditions of the human family except those of thestomach, which is unknown? If your answer is \"Yes\" to these, you are further advanced than the public gives you credit for, and no time should be lost inproclaiming that you do know and can successfully determine conditions as mentioned. If you answer \"No,\" then it is necessary for you to burn midnight oil and lie awake nights until you can prove them\u2014 by the Science of Chiropractic. (A pplause. \"We won't have mixed goods.\") You can pose as a professor of Chiropractic when you are able to analyze each and every cable of nerves as they issue from thespine so that you may determine, unfailingly, by the subluxation,right or left lateral, or posterior, what particular set of nerves areimpinged and determine then and there the diseased condition, where located, the nature and stage of the condition without further evidence. You will discover nerve fibres that send impressions to the brain, of taste, smell, sight and sound, so that by vertebral exam-ination, blindfolded, you may state at once whether the subject is defective in any or all of these senses and which one or more, without questioning or diagnosing symptoms. You will be so proficient as to keep the growth of the hair on the head in a naturaland normal condition and, by adjustment of proper character, growhair on the baldpate and beard on a smooth face and will, bycareful and persistent study of the two nervous systems show why the male is favored with a beard to hide his homely face, and the female is deprived of it so as not to hide her beauty. Why one scalp is clothed with silken tresses and another is scantily clothed withhair of abnormal texture. You will determine these, not by symptoms or visible means, but by examination of the vertebral column. Drop the attempt to name symptoms which are never alike in different persons. When asked the condition of my neighbor, whois suffering from some abnormal condition, I want to be able toanswer correctly in a way which can not be misunderstood.Symptoms may have as many names as professors diagnosing thecase. When I answer, \"My neighbor is suffering from nervousprostration,\" what does it explain? Nothing but that he is sick. Should I answer, \"He has rheumatism,\" it implies nothing 254ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS but that he is in pain. If I replied, \"Cancer,\" it only tells that he has an ugly sore, that is all. Let us be done with this quibbling.(Applause.) When any of my family or a neighbor is in abnormalcondition I want to know what and where the cause is, not the symptoms. Then I can answer intelligently\u2014a left lateralsubluxation of the sixth dorsal or right lateral of second lumbar, orwhere the existing causes are, give it out \"A. P.,\" \"D.P.,\" \"G. T.,\" or \"Go See,\" but the cause and location in plain English. I want the world so conversant with Chiropractic that they will, by answer given, be able to determine the location of distressor exercise heat as quickly as they would if I informed them thatmy neighbor had sprained the left ankle or broken his right arm. When you reach this elevation in the science of Chiropractic, you will be able to convince the most skeptical and prejudicedmortal that Chiropractic is a science and can be successfully demonstrated. As fast as you discover that a certain impingementproduces a specific diseased condition to a certainty, tell it to theworld and back it up with your reputation that such a disease neveris, or could exist, without this subluxation. You are now competent to trace the cause of any condition from effects; then you will unhesitatingly foretell effects from existing cause. But, as long as you undertake to name symptomsand then trace cause you are following the old-fashioned andprimitive stagecoach in which are comfortably lounging the M.D.'s, who are contented and satisfied that they have the only modeof traveling on the road to health, as is proven to them by othersfollowing in their wake and naming symptoms which convey to the reasoning mind\u2014nothing. Turn out and go by this lumbering and uncouth vehicle. Lay out a new trail. You have no business on this thoroughfare. The right of way has been granted, not by the people, but by the statutesinstituted in their behalf for guarding the public health. Open anew road, cut down the mammoth trees of prejudice. Clear awaythe undergrowth of ignorance. Lay your rails of truth on the solid ties of cause. Let every rail show the effect of the ties on which it rests, so that the whole line can be read like an interesting bookfrom Atlas to Sacrum. Equip this line with modern coaches ofChiropractic philosophy and your stations will be thronged withtourists who will procure through tickets\u2014will not ask forstop-over privileges, and the grass and weeds will grow in rankprofusion where now winds slowly along the old leather springcoach driven by that worn out quarter-Julep and Calomel in thewheel, and Quinine and Lancet in the lead, which are goaded onunder the lashes of Bluff and Superstition and is conveying todoom the unwilling but coerced slaves inside, chaperoned by aself-styled master, protected by Law. (Long applause.) 255THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC WHAT IS DISEASE ? This question is often asked by the thinking and unthinking alike, and has (outside of Chiropractic) never yet been answereddefinitely. Many theories have been offered, all of which seemedto have some plausible ( ?) point in their favor, but they are not ofany practical value to a Chiropractor except as illustrations of thefoolishness of the so-called \"Medical Science.\" Occasionally weare amused by some one making a \"discovery\" (save the mark)claiming to have found the all-pervading microbe which producesor causes the disease\u2014and an antitoxin to kill the microbe\u2014whichgenerally sends the patient, who takes this for a cured (?), toeternity. From a Chiropractic standpoint, the cause is so simple that it is a wonder that it was not discovered thousands of years ago. The Innate controls the body through mental force (which may be likened to Electricity), which is transmitted over the differentnerves to every organ and tissue of the body. Sometimes this forceis depleted (the reason why we are tired), when a twist is likely tocause a subluxation and the result is pressure upon nerves.Vertebral subluxations may also be the result of accidents, asviolent falls, etc. If the nerve is only slightly impinged, the energyhas a greater resistance to overcome, and the result is greateractivity in those parts where these nerves are distributed. Should itbe the calorific nerve, for instance, we have increased heat\u2014fever;or slight pressure upon motor nerves would produce symptoms likechorea, shaking palsy, etc. Should the spinal foramen be entirely occluded to shut off all circulation of forces, we find paralysis of those functions. A Chiropractor analyzes the condition, where the subluxation exists, of what kind, and adjusts accordingly\u2014and in a short time,if the wreck is worth while, he will have perfect health. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 TYPHOID FEVER. Mrs. N. E. K. allows me to say: \"My son Will, aged 17, came home sick on Saturday, August 10, and went to bed. On Monday we called our doctor, whopronounced his disease typhoid fever, and said he need not think ofbeing out before three weeks; that 'the fever had to have its run.' \"On the following Saturday afternoon Dr. Palmer, by request, sent two of his students over to see him. They gave him nomedicine and used nothing but their hands to adjust a displacedvertebra. Our doctor called in the evening, took his temperatureand found only a slight fever; he said that was funny. He told us inthe morning that his fever would rise toward 256ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS evening, and each day would be higher. The next morning he was surprised to find his temperature normal; he could not understandwhy such a sudden change. He did not know that a Chiropractorhad replaced the displaced vertebra. In the afternoon the studentsgave him the second adjustment. The next Tuesday Will went toDavenport, a distance of six miles. Our doctor saw him over thereand told me that he was out too soon; that he should have kept inbed for two or three days yet. We like the Chiropractic method andrecommend it.\" Are the above statements true? If not, the M. D.'s have an opportunity to prosecute Dr. Palmer for sending misleadingstatements through the mail, securing patients and money by fraud.Or did the M. D.'s make a mistake in diagnosis? If they don'tknow typhoid fever, are they not liable to make errors indiagnosing other fevers? An M. D. only needs to know that thepatient has fever. He does not understand what joint fails toarticulate properly, thereby causing a local excessive heat creatinga general fever. From a medical educational point of view, it iswell for him to be well-read upon the morphology, pathogenesisand biological characteristics of the bacillus which hismicroscopical perception fancies to be the etiology. But it isnecessary for a Chiropractor to know what nerves are impinged bya subluxated vertebra producing an inflammation from which theheat emanates. In typhoid fever we are able to locate the physical represent- ative of cause and adjust it. I will adjust free any case pronouncedtyphoid by an M. D.; provided he so states it in writing. Theyclaim it is one of the self-limited diseases. There is more money inadjusting such than there would be in adjusting the displaced bonewhich causes it. It is hard on the patient to be kept in bed for many weeks. It is also hard on the M. D. when a Chiropractor calls and adjustssubluxated vertebra. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 CHILD-BED FEVER. This disease is considered by medical men the most dangerous of any following child-birth. It is \"so rapid in its progress and sofatal in its effects\" that the average of death is one to three. It isthought \"the most serious of all those diseases that follow labor.\"Lying-in hospitals consider it infectious, the larger portion ofchild-births being followed by puerperal fever. One medical writer says: \"The causes which produce the terrible disorder are not very well understood,\" and \"the besttreatment of this terrible disease is one of the greatest problems inmedical science.\" The reader will please observe, \"the best treatment of this terrible disease.\" All schools treat diseases except the Chiro- 257THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC practors. Certain symptoms, when, associated together, are named child-bed fever. These symptoms are treated. All therapeuticalmethods, including Osteopathy, treat the symptoms of puerperalfever. These effects are but the results of abnormal functions, aderangement of the human mechanism, and a disturbance of thevital forces. Chiropractors find that these disordered functions are phys- ically produced by occluded foramina in the lumbar region, by avertebra being displaced during child-birth, causing pressure uponthose nerves that are deranged. Instead of treating the symptoms,they adjust, put in place the vertebrae which they find slightly outof line. Therapeutical methods can only treat effects. Causescannot be treated, they must be made right by adjustment. The primary cause that produces the morbid symptoms known by medical men as child-bed fever, they do not know. Theysuppose the cause to be infection, one mother catches it fromanother. If this be so, where did the first mother catch it? Wouldnot the same cause that produced it in the first also produce it inany other? Doctors can see symptoms, but are blind to their causes. Child-bed fever is always caused by a lumbar vertebra being displaced during child-birth. Such is liable to occur in anyobstetrician's practice, but he should know a subluxation and howto replace it. Acute inflammation is produced by the nerves beingimpinged in the occluded foramina. This excessive heat causesretention of the discharges which should follow child-birth, thestool and urine being scantily passed or not at all. To illustrate the difference between treating the symptoms of child-bed fever and the adjustment of the cause of those de-rangements, I will give a cause. A few years ago, on the day of February 5, I received a tele- phone message from Mr. Mc., of D., requesting me to take the nexttrain, as I was very much needed. His wife had been given up todie of child-bed fever by three doctors. I told my students beforeleaving what vertebra I would find displaced that was causing thecondition known as puerperal fever. I arrived there at 10 p. m. Her insane screaming could be heard a block away. Before going into the sick room. I told Mr. Mc. andthe nurse what was wrong, where the displaced vertebra was andhow I would replace it. Mr. Mc., being a mechanic, knew at oncejust what I was going to do and the reason therefor. It took but amoment to show them the vertebra that had been wrenched out ofplace, and the next moment saw it replaced by the hands of aChiropractor. Just then she coughed, and Mr. Mc. said, \"Thedoctors say that she has tuberculosis of the lungs.\" I gave her anadjustment in the dorsal region, where those nerves were impingedwhich caused irritation, that kept up the coughing, and said,\"Good-bye, tuberculosis.\" 258ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS In five minutes her hands and feet were warm instead of being cold, the cough gone, and the excessive heat (the M. D.'s fever),was absent from the head and trunk; her temperature was normal.By adjusting the spinal column to its normal position, I had takenthe pinch from the nerves that were deranged by an impingement.These nerves were now able to perform their natural functions in anormal degree. The next morning I found her asking for something to eat; she was very much better, although quite weak. At 9 a. m., her old physician made a pleasant call and was agreeably surprised to find her skin moist, the temperature andpulse normal. He was nonplussed and could not account for thewonderful change and asked if I had hypnotized her. I replied that Ihad used no more hypnotism than a jeweler would in fixing awatch; that she had been injured during child-birth, and that I hadonly fixed what was wrong. He said the fever would return thatafternoon; that the bowels would have to be moved by giving hersomething, and that she had tuberculosis of the lungs, which wasincurable. I told him that there was no reason to think that the feverwould return; that the stool would move all right, and tuberculosisshe did not have; that she had ceased coughing. All the naturalfunctions of the body were re-established and she made dailyimprovement without any further attention. The human machine had been disabled and obstructed. When all parts had been properly adjusted, placed in their normalposition, health was restored, because all functions were beingperformed in a natural manner. Mr. Mc. was able to say to hismany inquiring friends, that his wife was very much better. Theday before, they were expecting her to die, and her friends weresent for. I saw this old physician do as all medical men do when visiting the sick. He was careful to take the temperature (degree of heat) byplacing a thermometer in her mouth, an unhygienic practice, whenwe think of how many diseased mouths it had already been in.Then he judged of the action of the heart by taking cognizance ofthe pulse. This he had been doing with his patient for several days.The taking of the respiration, the pulse and temperature did notassist him in locating the cause. He was observing the effects, thathe might treat them. This he would have continued to do untildeath ended the scene. A Chiropractor was called who adjusted adisplaced lumbar vertebra, thereby saving a dear mother's life anddisappointing a Regular, Old School physician so badly that twoweeks later he refused to speak to the man who was able to locatea wrong and adjust it, which the old doctor had never thought of. How differently he would have treated me if this prognosis \"She cannot live; she cannot get well,\" had been correct. Howdifferently was my reception five minutes later by Dr. S., who 259THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC opened a bottle of fine wine and invited me to partake, and said, \"You did a good job up there.\" The other physician, in order toextenuate his failure, said, \"The fever had got to the highest, andwould have gone down just the same if Dr. Palmer had not beenthere.\" It often happens, when a Chiropractor adjusts a wrong, thatthe doctor's \"medicine begins to have an effect.\" The above may seem absurd to the average medical man, but like many other recent marvels, it only seems wonderful because itis unusual. When the cause of child-bed fever becomes generallyknown and physicians learn to adjust the displaced vertebra, it willnot look so marvelous. We have to nudge ourselves from day today in this age of swift surprises and remind ourselves that nothingthat is new to us can possibly be so remarkable as many things thathave grown familiar. Medical men diagnose a case, that they may know of the symptoms, so that they may be able to name the disease. Chi-ropractors analyze symptoms to locate the cause of our ailments.The M. D. injects an opiate to relieve pain by deadening sensationin nerves. The Chiropractor takes the pressure from the nerves thatthey may not be interfered with. The M. D. gives quinine to reducefever. The Chiropractor releases nerves that they may conveynormal amount of mental impulse, the normal degree of heat beingthe result. Why not drop your fads and learn the cause of inflammation which produced too much heat, and the abnormal condition whichcame very near robbing a family of its mother? Why not get out ofthe ruts? Why not learn what is wrong and then adjust it, instead ofleaving the injured part untouched? Why not learn to do somethingmore than to take the respiration, temperature and pulse? You willnever find the cause of ailments by using the thermometer, the testtube or the microscope. Why not quit old-time notions and dosomething to relieve the suffering? The sick need help, not drugs.The Allopaths and Osteopaths agree on diagnosis of fevers. W. D. Halliburton, a standard authority on physiology, says on page 595 of his book: \"Heat is the result of the formation ofcarbonic acid, water, urea and other excreted products. The greatsource of heat is chemical action.\" On page 600: producedby combustion process.\" On page 403: \"Microbes producefermentation by passing bacteria spores from one person toanother.\" Dr. A. P. Davis says, in his standard work on Osteopathy, page 284: \"Remember that stagnation or stasis of blood produceschemical changes that result in pathological conditions that wedenominate disease.\" On page 242: \"In all fevers, the friction iscaused by decomposition of the elements.\" On page 260ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS 244: \"Fever is the result of chemical changes in the elements; decomposition takes place, friction ensues, heat is the result.\" Dr. A. T. Still, in The Philosophy and Mechanical Principles of Osteopathy, says, page 87: \"Congestion of blood channels is followed by fermentation, which universally attacks all stagnantfluids of the body.\" On page 83: \"You should know, asphysiological reasoners, that phosphorus with oxygen and surfaceair, assisted by nerve and blood motion, aided by electricity,produces a union between the oxygen and phosphorus, and theaddition of nitrogen, which occupies much cellular space in thebody, produces the combustion known as fever heat.\" The Allopaths and Osteopaths agree with the Old School physicians of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as to theproduction of animal heat, whether in excess or normal amounts,as attested by many old books in our possession. Chiropractors hold that all functions of the body, whether normal or abnormal, are controlled by mental impulse. That nerveshave their special functions to perform. That certain mentalimpulses are thermogenic, produce heat, whether too much or notenough, or in normal degree. That pressure upon these nervesderanges their functions. That child-bed fever is the result ofnerves in the lumbar region being impinged as they emanate fromthe spinal cord through the intervertebral foramina. The reader can readily see, from the above, that the opinions of the Allopaths and Osteopaths harmonize as to the cause of animalheat of any degree; so much so that they use the same text books.They aim to inhibit fevers; the one by drugs, the other by manualmanipulation. There is no resemblance whatever between Chiropractic and either of the above schools. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"TO CURE OR HEAL.\" The public mind, in connection with Chiropractic, wrongfully use the Allopathic sign boards, \"cure\" and \"heal.\" It is difficult tobreak away from the use of words which we have used all ourlives, altho we may know that we use them incorrectly. We no more cure or heal our patients than the sun rises and sets. These are terms used to convey certain ideas. Every well informed person knows that our earth revolves upon its axis once in twenty-four hours, which causes the apparent risingand setting of the sun. A few Chiropractors wrongfully use the words cure and heal knowing full well that we do neither. We adjust the human frame, the skeleton bones, to their normal position, thereby releasingpressure on nerves; then Innate Intelligence is able to againperform its varied functions in normal force and quantity, which ishealth. 261THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC ACUTE AND CHRONIC DISEASES. John P. Arnold, M. D., says, in the New York Medical Journal: \"We have advanced in the bacteriology, pathology, hygiene, and the general study of medicine, but we are not much better equippedthan our forefathers were in treating a large proportion of cases,especially those in chronic disease.\" All chronic diseases are preceded by the acute stage. If there were no acute cases, there would be no chronic. In other words, ifthe cause of those conditions, listed as acute, were adjusted, therewould be no displacements of the bony framework to produce andperpetuate the chronic conditions. All acute diseases are characterized by excessive heat, com- monly known as fever. This heat softens bones, changes the shapeof vertebrae and the intervertebral foramina. These modificationsnot only alter the shape and size of the foramina, but causepressure upon the brain nerves as they proceed from the spinalcord. Innate Intelligence may in time so modify the opening thruwhich the nerves pass, that they cease to be impinged. How muchbetter that we should know where and how the pressure isproduced, and then remove it by replacing the vertebra in itsformer normal position. A knowledge of bacteriology, pathology, hygiene and medicine does not assist us in locating displaced joints which impingenerves, thereby increasing or decreasing their functions; eithercondition being that of disease. Therefore, we fully agree with Dr.Arnold in the above paragraph. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 CANCERS. Chiropractic has taught us brevity; therefore, if you desire to learn the definition, symptoms and physical signs, pathology, theusual diagnosis, morbid anatomy, the M. D.'s treatment andprognosis, please read medical books or ask your physician, for Iwish to dwell only upon the etiology and the proper adjustment toallow the rebuilding of abnormal malignant growths called cancer.These last named items you cannot learn from medical men ortheir books. That I may be better understood, I will preface my statement by saying that no two of us look or act alike in shape and size of ourbones; no vertebra in one spinal column will fit any other; no twoof us have arteries and veins just alike; no two persons have nervesthat sense alike; none of us see, feel, smell or have the same taste.If it is a fact that we are unlike in health, then how much more sowhen we are ailing, when the function of nerves is deranged byimpingement? No two persons are alike physically or mentally,therefore, the manifestations of disease, whether local or general,are never the same 262ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS in two or more individuals, altho the location of the physical representative may be the same, yet the combination of functionsinvolved would vary, in degree and quality, in each case. Cancers are the products of the lack of or stimulated trans- mission and expression of corresponding currents of mental im-pulses. We no longer wonder that there are no many kinds whenwe consider that no two of us sense alike. All cancers, no matter inwhat part of the body, have one and the same cause; they areproduced by hindered mental impulse, but the effect of theseimpeded impulses show their dissimilarity in the great diversity ofcancers. All actions of the body whether normal or abnormal, pleasant or unpleasant, whether in health or disease, are but the products ofcoordination or incoordination. The educated mental impulsesperform the acquired movements. The Innate mental impulsescontrol all of the functions of the body, whether these actions arenatural or otherwise. Displaced symptoms are but decreased orincreased normal functions. The normal medium, is health ; anydeviation either way from that is disease. All ailments are but theresult of either depressed or exaggerated qualities of mentalimpulses produced by irritation or paralysis of functions. Thisexcited or depressed conditions has, as its producer, pressure on nerves at their exit from spinal column. In health, one set of the efferent nerves convey a normal supply of calorific mental impulses, maintaining thereby a normaltemperature of 98 degrees. If the nerves be slightly impinged thesupply of impulses will be increased\u2014excessive\u2014the M. D.'sfever is the product. When all nerves are free from impingement, then all actions are performed normally and the result is health. A mental impulsehindered produces too much action or not enough. In cancers thereare exaggerated functions. A cancer is but the result, the expression of an abnormal mental impulse; therefore, to restore cancerous tissue to normal we mustadjust the physical representative of the cause, the nerve beingimpinged by an occlusion of the foramen in the spinal columnmust be released. The location of cancer shows to a Chiropractor what nerves are affected by being impinged in the spinal column. He is able tolocate where they are pinched, producing their derangements withcorresponding results. There are fifty-two articulations in the vertebral column. Each of these are liable to be wrenched from their normal position,making an M.D.'s sprain a Chiropractic subluxation. Cancers are not alone the result of nerves being impinged in the foramina, but also the vital issue\u2014 the cause\u2014is the interference with current, without which life could not have existed. The injurythat made the subluxation, which pinched nerves of 263THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC several functions, causing the condition named cancer, is always found to have been of many years standing. The location of a cancer determines to a Chiropractor the intervertebral foramen in which the nerves are pinched. Thesensitive nerve can be traced by digital examination to and fromthe cancer and the occluded foramen. Bear in mind that all subluxations of the vertebrae change the size and shape of the foramen, but do not necessarily produceocclusion. But whenever the superior processes are thrownforward, causing more or less lordosis, separating the articularsurfaces, such derangements cannot help but alter the size andshape of the foramen and impinge the nerve or nerves that passthru the opening, thus diminishing, either in part or wholly, thecaliber; hence, carrying capacity of those nerves. Current is what isbroken, either by intensification or extreme loss of. The surgical method of cancer increases the pain and distress of the afflicted and does not adjust the cause, while the Chiropracticadjustment usually restores the current by degrees and action iscorrespondingly restored also, hence healthy, normal tissuessupply those that are decayed. The practical side of Chiropractic is, that the cancer fades into oblivion in proportion as restoration of new cells takes place, byreversing process of retention and excretion, and the life of thepatient is manifested in a coordinated manner. No useless medicineis given to depress the system, no knives or anesthetic used toendanger life. The cancer disappears by absorption, pus, orsloughing. If small and not open it is absorbed; if large and notopen, it decays, forming pus of a green color; if large and open, itbecomes dead and separates from the living tissue. Adjust the subluxation, release the impinged nerves, restore the normal circuit, re-establish the cycle, minus interruptions; theresult is normal, healthy tissue; that is Chiropractic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 CATARRH. Catarrh is the name given to a combination of symptoms, of which excessive heat predominates, followed by drying anddecomposition of the product of the mucous membrane\u2014serum\u2014of any internal cavity or hollow organ. It usually means, if nototherwise defined, catarrh of (P. 245) head, nose, hypertrophicrhinitis, and eustachian tube. The mucous membrane is of serous origin, and is one of the transitional tissues of that character. We find serous circulationexceedingly complete in these tissues. Mucus being thetransformation from serum thru the mucous membrane. This is theinside skin, begins at the entrance to the buccal cavity, extendsthroughout all internal organs, ending at the anus. Ear, 264ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS nose, mouth, eustachian tube, throat, stomach, bowels, bladder, vagina, uterus, urethra, lungs, etc., are lined with mucous mem-brane. It derives its name, mucus, because of transforming the serum, which is of milky consistency, to that of a slimy fluid afterosmosing thru mucous membrane. This mucous fluid keeps theorgans in constant lubrication, and assists digestion as well as byplacing a coating around foods to assist in their outward passage. Catarrh represents a decomposition of this serous product, due to an excessive heat. This is frequently referred to as a mucousheat or catarrhal fever. The excessive heat proves the existence ofstimulated calorific mental impulses, ending in the membraneaffected. Calorific chemicals are deposited in normal quantities,but excessive mental impulses cause more than normalcombustion. Slight pressure upon these (calorific) efferent nervesas they leave the spinal column is the physical representative of thecause of the stimulated condition. Excessive heat, in mucous membrane, dries the mucous fluid, the consistency of which in normal state, is like thin mucilage. Asit dries by excessive heat it thickens, the froth is followed by spotsof thick, white, then gummy and ropy matter which in turn isstreaked with yellow, then covered with green, which is the laststage of decomposition. In catarrh of stomach, gastric catarrh, the medical profession would maintain that a lack of gastric juice was prevailing. The quantity is normal, but excessive heat dries what is deposited, so much so, that its action cannot be normal. The largerportion of the gastric juice of the stomach is manufactured by thespleen. In this instance the quantity of gastric juice is not molested.The surface of the stomach is covered with multitudinous nervefibrils, each fellow having its function to perform. In catarrh ofstomach this inside skin, mucous membrane is reddened andswollen. Thus we might proceed indefinitely with each form of catarrh that is brought to our daily practice. Each form receiving its nameaccording to the organ, quantity involved and location of theaffection. The cause of disease is the inability of Innate to express her wonted mental functional abilities thru a certain organ by means ofimpulses that are carried by nerves and then placed into action toperform the functions of impulses. If hindrance occurs, disease isthe result. The character of the disease depending entirely uponwhat functions are being hindered and to what extent. In catarrh the abnormal function is heat. Restore this to normal by proper adjustment of the subluxations, that are always present,and healthy tissue is the result. It cannot be otherwise. Catarrh inany form or location cannot exist under normal con- 265THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC ditions. During adjustment you will notice that effects disappear in a reversed manner to what they came. The hard, solid, lumpy formof the discharge will begin to liquify, the nose or organ involvedwill flow the same quantity of substance as previously, only it ischanged to its liquid state. Following the removal of all greenmatter, mucus will appear streaked with yellow, then thick, gummyand ropy, each taking its return period to the normal. You havenow reversed effects by reversing its cause. Catarrh is universal in all states, and is one of the easiest and quickest effects to show Chiropractic results. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES. The mucous membrane lines all the surfaces of the canals, tubes or hollow organs that have external openings. The serousmembranes cover the surfaces of those organs that have externalopenings and those organs which do not open externally. Thismembrane being one of the divisions of the complete serouscirculatory system, it is one of its transitional tissues. The synovial membranes line the joints, not between the joints where the thin cartilages are, but around the joints. This synovial membrane secretes a fluid named synovia. It is used to lubricate the thin cartilage, the ligaments, muscles and allparts of joints. We have pointed out to you the results of excessive heat on the mucous and serous membranes, what effect has excessive heat,inflammation, on the synovial membranes, similar to the othermembranes, viz., that of producing an over supply, or that ofdrying the synovial fluid and depositing it on the articular surfacesof the joints. This deposit we are told by the chemists is urate ofsoda. It is deposited in crystalline form, as you may see by thesespecimens, above and on the articular surfaces of the joints. Thenames of disease under which these deposits are formed is usuallycalled articular rheumatism, or arthritis as you students willremember in studying the vertebral column. We will find the sameconditions of long bones as we have on the articular surfaces ofshort bones. Medical men suppose that these deposits produce the in- flammation of the joints. As I have told you before, reverse whatthe medical men say of the cause of disease, etiology, and you willcome nearer to the truth. The inflammation induces the synovial fluid to dry and deposit on these surfaces. These crystalline deposits on the articular surfaces prevent the free, smooth, easy movements of the joints, and produce thatcreaking feeling and sound felt and heard upon moving 266ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS the joints of the rheumatic, the unfortunate person afflicted with the gout, arthritis deformans, of which we will learn more in ourlesson. The normal effects, decreased or increased in disease. We have just noticed the effects in one extreme, now we will noticethe effects where there is an excess of this synovial fluid. Re-member what we have said of all diseased conditions, that they arebut extremes of the normal either way, either too much or notenough. When we find excessive secretion of the synovial fluid,we have dropsy of the joint, of the ofthe heart (cardiac the the lung (plura,hydrothorax); general dropsy (anasarca); and so on. This condition, called by the medical men dropsy, water dropped, is the result of an over action, too much life, it is oversecreted, causing an over supply, a surplus of fluid elaborated orheld. In this we often use the common accepted name of dropsy.As we understand it in a Chiropractic sense, it is a fluid that is oversecreted and retained. The contents of cysts, excess of fluids collected, are either liquid, serous, yellowish-white, like milk, reddish, albuminous,adipose, or caseous; these are more or less thickened fluids fromsome of the membranes, whose integuments are unduly activefollowing a light pressure, the twig ends of which end there. Theabnormal results from abnormal actions are never just alike,because in the first place, the same functions in no two persons arealike, and they are never under different conditions just alike in thesame person. Diseased conditions increase a greater variation ofthe action and the result of those actions. Those abnormal conditions, diseased affections, are produced by unnatural action of impulses; reverse this action from abnormalto that of normal, allow the nerves to act normally, then theseabnormal effects will be in harmony right. For example, the fluidssecreted by the liver, called bile, is thickened and dried byhepatitis, excessive heat, until the fluid is made into solid piecescalled billiary calculi, or gall stones; these may be found in thesubstances of the liver or in the gall ducts, where they have passeddown from the gall bladder thru the cystic duct, but are usuallyfound in the gall bladder. These concretions, fluid dried and retained in solid form, are liable to be found in any part of the body, usually in such organsacting as reservoirs, or the canals passing from them. We havecalculi of joints, articular deposits of chalk in gout, called goutstones. Calculi of the kidneys or of the bladder, called gravel.Calculi of the lungs, of the breast, of the pancreas, etc. Medicalmen, in their books, state that these calculi, hardened secretions,are not soluble, cannot be disintegrated; they only know ofspontaneous expulsion or extraction by some one 267THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC of the operative methods. Chiropractors are the first to discover that any of these calculi, no matter in what part of the body theyare, may be dissolved by Innate Intelligence, but we, theIntellectual Intelligence, must make conditions favorable for Innateto return the abnormal results back to normal. Now, then, let us repeat, in order that we may make the subject not only more clear, but that we may be able to proceed farther.We desire to make our explanation so that they will explain,because there is so much of medical explanation that does notexplain; where is there medical education that does? The nerves that reach to and end in the liver or gall bladder are pressed upon as they emerge from the spinal canal, producing,inflammation in those organs. The effects, the result of thefunctions of nerves, whether normal or abnormal, are at the twigends of those nerves. This excessive heat\u2014remember that all heat produced in the body, whether in excess or a lack of\u2014is, by and thru mentalimpulses, not blood, as we have been taught by all schools, in-cluding the advanced Osteopathy\u2014this excessive heat dries bile,solidifying it into hardened chunks. By freeing those nerves, weliberate these mental impulses that were interrupted by theforamina that was partially occluded, and allow them to performtheir natural functions; the result is that the calculi are returned,dissolved, disintegrated to their former liquid condition and passedthru the natural channels. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 DIPHTHERIA. Mrs. J. H. M\u2014\u2014 was visiting at her mother's home in Rock Island. She had set a day to return west. But as her daughter,Morine, age nine, was taken with diphtheria in an aggravated form,the home trip had to be deferred. I was called on September 23d,twenty-four hours later. The neighbor's house had a \"diphtheria\"card on it, and the usual quarantine regulations ruled. Morine has been subject to spells of croup. A Chiropractor recognizes that croup and diphtheria are symptoms that have theircause in the same subluxated vertebra. These two ailments differ indegree, as do other diseases, so that it is difficult to draw the lineof distinction. The functions expressed by mental impulses arenever exactly alike; they differ as do sensations of differentpersons in health and disease. A few questions and an analysis showed diphtheria symptoms fully developed. I told the family, who are acquainted withChiropractic adjustments, where we would find the subluxatedvertebra. I found in this case, as I have always, a displaced dorsal vertebra, and a sensitive nerve emanating from the partly oc- 268ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS cluded foramen, which covered the membrane of the throat with its branches. The quantity of mental impulses was excessive,therefore the expression of too much heat at the twig ends ofnerves, because of being pinched in the foramina. Poisons taken changes the character of impressions into the system in food and water that is polluted, or by breathing noxiouseffluvia from decaying vegetable or animal matter, or by theoutrageous practice of the M. D., who injects vaccine poison into ahealthy person, which induces a violent responsive action onmuscles sufficiently to displace vertebrae and impinge nerves,causing derangements which we name disease. We placed the patient on the table and adjusted the displaced vertebra. She arose and said, \"Mamma, I feel better already.\" Infive minutes the excessive heat had subsided. The next day I foundher very much better. At the third call, she having the benefit oftwo adjustments, I found her up and wanting something to eat.Seven days later she was in our office and no physician wouldhave thought from her appearance that she had had diphtheria. Vaccine virus, or other poisons which create diseased con- ditions, will not permanently affect the patient when a Chiro-practor keeps the vertebra in proper position. We have checked thefun of doctors and saved children from being poisoned byadjusting the vertebra that the pus poisoning was displacing. The Allopath and Osteopath agree in that diphtheria is highly contagious, readily communicable from one person to another, thatKlebs-Loeffler bacillus is the cause. This theory is founded on fermenting spores being transmitted from one person to another, as in yeast. In treatment they differ,the Osteopath aiming to do with his hands what the medical mantries to do with his drugs. The Osteopath gives a general treatment,which takes five pages to describe, and over an hour of hard workto perform the 200 movements explained. This treatment is to berepeated every six to eight hours. The Chiropractor replaces a vertebra by one move, which takes but a moment. Wherein does the Chiropractor resemble theOsteopath or Allopath? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 EPILEPSY. If physicians knew that the warmth of the body was produced by combustion of chemicals, which is the offal of nutritivesubstances, produced by calorific mental impulse conveyedthrough efferent nerves that the excess was produced by excessivecombustion, which is induced by too much current; that epilepticattacks were always preceded by an outburst of caloricity in theupper dorsal; that when the attack ceased the 269THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC body resumed its normal temperature; that these paroxysms were produced by an occluded foramen which impinges nerves; that theprimary cause was made so by a wrench; that the replacing of thesubluxated vertebra would free the pinched nerves so that theycould perform their normal functions uninterrupted; if physiciansknew that the above propositions were demonstrated facts, andwere able to replace the displaced vertebra to its normal position,they would certainly adjust the cause instead of giving medicaltreatment for the effects \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 FELON. \"What causes a felon, and what treatment would you recom- mend for a felon?\" A felon is caused by nerve impingement between dorsal vertebrae. Chiropractors relieve all pain in a moment, by taking thepressure from the pinched nerves. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 GALLSTONES. Mrs. Black had gallstones. She was taken to the hospital and submitted to an operation, which was \"a wonderful success\" ; butthe doctor's certificate stated, \"Death resulted from Loliaceumafter operation.\" For the benefit of our readers I will give the fullterm as given by Dunglison. \"Loliaceum radicerepente,\" which genitourinary irritation and inflammation, because ofits aperient and drastic qualities. An intelligent Chiropractor, understanding the principles of Chiropractic, would know that gallstones are consolidated bile;that there was an excessive heat in the region of the liver andgall-bladder to produce this condition; that all bodily heat, whetherin excess or otherwise, mental impulses, and not of the blood, aswe have been taught by the old schools; that the nerves whichproceed from the spinal foramen have been encroached upon andimpingement, which causes interference with nerve function, andinflammation in the area mentioned. We have shown you that a medical man treats the effects, he does not know the cause; therefore, an operation is performed,which gives the undertaker a job, and throws the blame on\"Loliaceum.\" We, as Chiropractors, would relieve the pressure by reducing the spinal subluxation, thereby allowing the nerves to perform theirnormal functions, which softens the hardened hire, returning it toliquid condition. 270ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS GOITRES. Chiropractors do not \"treat\" goitres. They adjust the cause, replace the vertebra, release the pressure on a nerve, which re-stores co-ordination, hence no enlargement named goitre can exist. The practioner and layman are not to blame for using the words \"treat\" and \"treatment,\" for they have known nothing else but thevarious methods of treating. Chiropractors do not treat the goitre.They find the cause and take off pressure from the nerve, whosefunctions are exaggerated. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 INSANITY. \"Dr. T. S. disappeared two weeks ago last night very mys- teriously, leaving word that he was called away suddenly, andevery effort to locate him since has utterly failed. He took with himover $1,100 in cash, which he drew from the American ExchangeBank that day. No reason is known for his leaving, and his familyis at a loss to account for his absence. \"The last seen of the missing man was on Thursday evening, May 15th, when his son, Thomas J. S. called at his office. Hisfather was apparently in the best of health and spirits, and saidnothing whatever about going away, although later developmentsshow that he had been planning that day to go somewhere. \"Friday was 'Ladies day,' when women patients called at the office for treatment. The doctor's wife had been in the habit ofassisting him on these occasions and went to the office expectingto find him there, thinking that she would learn why her husbandhad not been home the night before. His absence did not alarm her,as his practice had at times kept him from home. \"On the table in his office she found an envelope addressed to her in the doctor's hand-writing and containing a brief notescribbled on a scrap of paper, which read: \"'Dear Sarah:\u2014I have been called away suddenly. Get along as best you can until I return. THOMAS.' \"Beside the envelope was a bunch of keys usually carried by her husband. She still expected that he had been called to somecase in the remote part of the city, and that he would come induring the morning, but when he failed to appear she finallybecame alarmed and sent for her son. \"They then decided that the affair be kept quiet and what inquiries were made were among intimate friends who were askedto say nothing about it. It was not until May 25th that any newswas received, and then a letter came from Seattle, Wash., signed'W. H. Watson.' It was written with lead pencil on a note-head ofHotel Ranier Grand, of that city, dated May 19th. 271THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC \"The writer said that Dr. S. was in good hands, under the care of 'Brother Masons.' He had been found on the train Friday (theday after he was supposed to have left D\u2014\u2014) acting strangely. Hehad a through ticket to Seattle. He was unable to give an accountof himself, but his identity was learned from the papers carried. Hehad been placed in a good hospital, and the attending doctors saidhe had a case of brain fever. He talked continually of Dr. Murrayand Ida and Ida's baby, and seemed to believe he was taking thebaby where they could not get it. He called for Ida very often, andat times said that the office must be closed up and the heads andcases be placed in the high school. Watson said S\u2014\u2014 was doingwell, and would probably be better in a day or two, and promisedto write again in that time. \"Manager Dunbar, of the Hotel Ranier Grand, was wired to at once, and replied that he knew nothing of Dr. S\u2014\u2014 and that hehad not been there, nor could he be located at any of the hospitalsor at other hotels. He added that W. H. Watson left on May 20th. \"The D\u2014\u2014 police were then applied to, and in response to a telegram from Chief Troyer, Chief Sullivan, of Seattle, wired thathe could not locate either S\u2014\u2014 or Watson in that city. \"It was learned that he asked a friend for the loan of a grip, saying that he expected to be called away soon and needed it. Hisfriend brought his suit case to the doctor's office on the day hedisappeared, and the doctor evidently took it with him. \"As before stated, no reason is known for the disappearance of the doctor. He had a beautiful home on East Sixth street, and avery large practice. He had never shown any indication of mentaldisorder, although he had been working very hard for five or sixyears, as his practice grew. \"The letter signed 'Watson' had every indication of having been written by someone acquainted with Dr. S\u2014\u2014, or at leastwith some of the missing man's affairs. The 'Ida' referred to wasDr. S\u2014\u2014's daughter, who resides in the east end. A baby wasborn to Mr. and Mrs. Arbouin about two months ago, which livedbut a week. \"The missing man is about fifty-eight years of age, has lived in D\u2014\u2014 and practiced the healing art for several years, and has afamily, the youngest of whom is fifteen years of age. He is aThirty-second degree Mason and a Mystic Shriner. \"'I do not know what to think\" said T. J. S\u2014\u2014 last night. 'The more I learn of the case, the more mystified I am. We have doneeverything that we can think of to locate my father, but withoutlearning anything. The family relations were always pleasant;father had been fixing up his home, his business was prosperous,and his health was apparently ex- 272ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS cellent. He took great pride in his garden, and it is one of the finest in the city. No, I cannot even form a theory, and we are simplywaiting in hopes that something will turn up'.\" The above was copied from the Duluth, Minn., Herald, of Friday morning, May 30, 1902. The most interesting and instructive part of this strange story is yet to be told by the writer. Dr. S\u2014\u2014 is a graduate of The P. S. C. Among other efforts to locate the missing man, they wrote to me, thinking it possible thathe had taken a notion to come here. About June 7th I received ashort letter from Dr. S\u2014\u2014 , written at San Francisco, stating thathe was going to Los Angeles, and that he wanted someChiropractic literature. This letter was immediately forwarded tohis family. From that time any knowledge of Dr. \u2014\u2014 waspromptly passed between the family and me. Whenever Dr. S\u2014\u2014 was heard from he was always going to some other place. About June 14th I made up my mind to go to thecoast and locate him. He seemed to have a traveling mania, wasliable to be heard from at any place between Spokane, Wash., andSan Diego, California. June 28th I arrived in Pasadena. On June 30th I made a trip to Ocean Side. Dr. S\u2014\u2014 was on that train going to San Diego, butwas not seen by me. The house where Dr. \u2014\u2014 had been rooming was located. The landlady thought he acted strange at times; she took him to be asporting man, and did not see much of him, as he only roomedthere, taking his meals elsewhere. She had read the above item,which had been copied in the Los Angeles Times. She did not have the least idea that she had the much sought for man in her house. I kept in touch with the S\u2014\u2014 family in D\u2014\u2014. They heard from him occasionally, but he was always on the go, just going tosome other place, so that by the time I got notice from D\u2014\u2014, itwould be about ten days, which gave him time to make anothermove. About July 15th I was at Los Angeles; I had just entered a street car for Pasadena. Dr. S\u2014\u2014, accompanied by a boy about the ageof fifteen, entered the car and was immediately recognized,although he did not look like the former Dr. S\u2014\u2014. His face wasbloated, an eye blackened from a bruise; his clothing was soiledand unkempt; he was a very different looking man than the Dr. S\u2014\u2014 of a year ago. We took him in charge. Arriving in Pasadena, Iwired his wife, \"I got him; a little off.\" His family had written meto \"Head him off if possible.\" He was in a pitiable condition; he knew that he was not mentally right; for that reason he had the boy care for him. 273THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC We showed him the picture of the class in which he graduated. He did not recognize his own likeness or that of any member of theclass. He would say: \"I ought to know them, but I don't.\" Frequently for hours at a time he did not know anything, and only knew of that which transpired during those unconscious spellsfrom what others told him. On one occasion he sat on a rock onSanta Barbara beach, when the tide was out. He remained thereuntil the incoming tide was up to his waist; some bathers observedhis condition and took him ashore. He says that on all suchoccasions, when he came to himself, there were Masons caring forhim. After satisfying ourselves that Dr. S\u2014\u2014 was mentally deranged, and knowing that the cause of his condition was adisplacement (subluxation) of a cervical, I spoke of it and hereplied, \"I know that is the cause, and I have been trying to findsomeone to fix it.\" I took him in my adjusting room, laid him on atable, and by one Chiropractic move, adjusted the displacedcervical that had been pressing on the nerves that went to the rightside of his head and he said: \"This side of my head has been gonefor a long time, it is here now, I can think.\" He arose with hisformer intellect. After dinner I asked him how much money he had. He replied that he did not know. I asked him where he kept it. He said: \"I usedto keep it in my inside vest pocket.\" Upon looking, he found $460.He then inquired how much he had when he left home. I told himthat he drew out of the bank $1,100. As fast as we thought best weinformed him how matters were at home. We tried to keep him and the boy over night, but we had been imprudent in showing the boy a case of bones, therefore, we couldnot persuade him to stay. They returned the next day according topromise. It was surprising to see how differently the boy viewedthe bones. The evening before he was afraid that the doctor mightwant his bones, now he took much interest in handling them andasking questions, the fear of the day before had all disappeared. Dr. S\u2014\u2014's case was certainly a peculiar one. He told me that when he was on the boat going to Catalina Island, which is thirtymiles from the main land, that \"the other fellow\" wanted him to goto the side of the boat, jump in and end all that he had all he coulddo to keep himself near the center of the boat. About two weeks after the first adjustment, he came in and said that he had quite a time to get to my place, that \"the other fellow\"talked climate in San Diego, and he talked adjustment in Pasadena.\"But I got here.\" To anyone but a graduate of The P. S. C. this language would seem strange. A man met Dr. S\u2014\u2014 in Los Angeles and called him by name. The doctor told him that he had the advantage, that 274ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS he did not remember of ever meeting him. The stranger said he ought to know him, that he had been his nurse in a hospital threeweeks, that he had given him lots of medicine. The doctor repliedif he had taken any medicine, he had not been conscious of it; thatthere was a long period of time that was a blank to him. Dr. S\u2014\u2014 had no remembrance of anything that transpired since seeing his son Tom in his D\u2014\u2014 office. The first that herealized was that he was walking on the street of a strange city. Heinquired what place it was and was told it was \"Frisco.\" Herealized that he was not right mentally. He remembered that he wasa lover of flowers, and thinking that the sight of them might placehim in his right element, he inquired where he might find them. Hehad not yet discovered that he was in \"the land of flowers.\" Fromthat time he was partially conscious at times, realizing hiscondition, and at other times he was entirely unconscious,especially when \"the other fellow\" wanted to change to some otherlocation, making an expense for the doctor; when he was himself,he was averse to spending his money. One very warm day he was in Pasadena. \"The other fellow\" was running him all over town, which was not to his liking. Dr. S\u2014\u2014 was handled for two months by two different intelligences; the Educated never being fully conscious. When theInnate had full control, the Educated was not active. The movingof the doctor from place to place, buying the tickets, doing thebusiness that is usually done by the Educated, was done by theInnate. After having the displaced cervical replaced, he longed for his family, but when he thought of returning home, there came adreadful fear over him, so much so, that he did not dare think ofgoing to Duluth to settle up his business. He had a great fear of becoming insane again. He felt for a time the need of keeping within calling distance of a Chiropractor. Attimes he would say, \"Insane persons always think that they are allright, if I am not, I want you to tell me so. I think that I am, but Iknow that I am not the one to be a competent judge.\" NOTE.\u2014For obvious reasons we have omitted names and addresses. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 MASSAGE ON THE BACK. Under the above heading, the August issue of The Medical Standard says: \"Modern medicine calls attention to the effec- tiveness of rubbing and manipulating the back as a means ofrelieving a multitude of distressing symptoms from which theneurasthenic patient suffers.\" 275THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Neurasthenia means \"Nervous exhaustion,\" a run-down con- dition, an impaired activity of the nervous system. A word thatcomes handy, and is often used by an M. D. or D. O. when thecause of general weakness is not known. The Standard says that there is \"a multitude of distressing symptoms\" of this class.Knowing that medicines do not reach this host of ailments, theeditor asserts that rubbing and manipulating of the back givesrelief. There are a number of diseases for which medicine is of novalue; but a general massage of the back is a relief. After describing various movements and manipulations for the back, he reminds his medical brethren, \"If greater attention weregiven to these simple therapeutic measures by physicians, therewould be less room for the exploits of Osteopaths and otherimperfectly qualified persons.\" If rubbing and manipulating is so \"simple\" and achieves such renowned, heroic deeds, as done by \"imperfectly qualified per-sons,\" why not make it an important part of your curriculum, teachit in your colleges, and include it in your state examination? Whynot be Osteopaths? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 TAPEWORMS. Chiropractors do not expel them; they do nothing as an M. D. does. Tapeworms are parasitical scavengers. They subsist upon decayed food. Those who are afflicted with such parasites haveindigestion. A Chiropractor takes the pressure from the stomachnerves. When the digestive tract is in normal condition there willbe no suitable food for scavengers; they will be digested as otherfood. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 SEROUS MEMBRANES. Mucous membranes line the inside surface of all hollow organs, canals or tubes that have an external opening. Serous membranes cover certain organs and those cavities, internally and externally, that do not open externally. The mucous membrane lines the lids of the eyes, nasal pass- ages, the auditory canal of the ear, the Eustachian tubes, the lips,all parts of the mouth, the throat, trachea (windpipe) and bronchialtubes, gall bladder, tubes of the pancreas and liver, the ceacum andthe appendix, the stomach and bowels to and including the anus,bladder, uterus, vagina, ureter and urethra. The serous membranes cover the brain, heart, chest, the abdo- men, the pleura, or outside coverings of the lungs, the peritoniumthat encloses the viscera of the abdomen. The mucous membrane secretes a mucous slimy fluid; the serous membrane has a thin watery fluid. 276ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Some of the diseases of mucous membrane are granulated eyelids, rhinitis of the nose, catarrh of the ear, catarrh of the lungs,which is an affection of the tubes of the lungs, generally known astubercular consumption; catarrh of the stomach, known as gastritis;appendicitis, inflammation of the appendix; diphtheria and croup isan inflammation of the mucous membrane of the throat; and so onwith the diseases of the bladder, the vagina and uterus. In diseases of the serous membrane, we have inflammation of the brain causing sclerosis and mollitis, hardening and softening.These diseased conditions in the soft tissues are the same that wehave been studying in the diseased bones. Of the heart, we havepericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, the outsidemembrane or covering, this smooth membrane when lubricatedprevents friction during its movements. If this membrane becomesinflamed we have an inflammation of the heart named pericarditis;the result is a tendency to produce and retain too much serum; thisunusual amount of held-up serum is nameddropsy-hydropericardium. The membrane that lines the heart onthe inside is liable to be inflamed, this condition is called en-docarditis. All the diseases of the mucous membrane and the serous membrane that we have noticed, and many more, have theirprimary cause in nerves that are conveying too much calorificmental impulse, producing too much heat in the membrane that isaffected. What we have just said in regard to the cause is as far asan M. D. would desire to go. But Chiropractors ask what is thecause of this undue amount of heat? We find that if a nerve, or abundle of nerves, are pinched that there is an abnormal effect, viz.,too much action or not enough. In the diseases noticed there wastoo much heat, too much action and too much life. Disease is anextreme either way. Cancers come under the head of diseases of the serous membranes \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 MUMPS. G. K. brought his son Willie, January 15, to be adjusted for mumps. On the 17th he brought his daughter Helen, who had thesame disease. One adjustment each made these children well,while other affected children were absent from school during therun of the disease with its complications. Which is better, to treat effects and let the disease have it usual run (for it is one of the self-limited diseases of the medical men),or adjust a displaced vertebra and have it fixed at once? Anotherquestion, as readily answered by the Chiropractor: Why does thephysician prescribe remedies for this disease, its complications andsequelae? The first question is already answered by the reader,viz.: Adjust the cause, of course, 277THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC if the physician knows where and how. The second is as readily answered. If the physician knew the cause, he would adjust itinstead of prescribing for the effects. But, says, one, \"The Osteopaths do not prescribe drugs.\" Dr. A. T. Still, in his book, The Philosophy and Mechanical Principles of Osteopathy, on pages 114 to 116, says: \"That all contagious diseases, including mumps, are developed from latent seeds thatare lying dormant in the fascia; that extremes of heat and coldvitalize them.\" Dr. A. P. Davis, in Osteopathy Illustrated, gives his treatment for mumps. I will quote it so you may see the dissimilarity betweenChiropractic adjustment and Osteopathic treatment. Page 288 says:\"The proper method of treatment, then, is to manipulate closeunder the angle of the jaw and relieve all contracture in muscles inthat region; then stretch the neck, as directed elsewhere (see page191, it consists of two dozen movements), twisting it at the sametime, and then manipulate all of the muscles of the neck, raise theclavicles, arms, chest; stimulate the vasomotor area. The glands areeasily relieved of their contents, and will be rapidly disengaged bymanipulating them as directed for a few moments; removingsoreness gradually by the beginning of manipulations at the outeredge of the soreness. In this affection general treatment should behad every day, and the disease may be reduced to a minimum, andby avoiding exposure to cold no danger of metastasis. Should thatoccur, follow up the treatment. Gentle treatment daily, or twice aday, relieves and shortens the disease and mitigates the sufferinggreatly.\" The Chiropractor adjusts one vertebra by one move, unknown to Osteopathy, which does not occupy a minute. Wherein is thereany resemblance between Osteopathic treatment and the results,and that of Chiropractic adjustment and its immediate effects? Does a Chiropractor practice either medicine or Osteopathy? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 PARALYSIS. HISTORY OF CASE We became acquainted with A. S. Dresher on December 2, 1897 (thirteen years ago). On that date he came to our infirmary oncrutches. He was as cross as two sticks. We drew from him thefollowing history of the case: During the past eighteen months he had paid out $1,000 in doctor bills. Nine doctors said that he was a helpless paralytic. Asfar as feeling and use was concerned, his leg was dead. Better farto have remained in that condition than to allow the doctors toamputate it as they desired. Pins could be thrust into it withoutcausing sensation, there was no feeling in it whatever. 278ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS There were several running sores from his hip to the ankle. Above the knee it was three inches less in circumference than its mate. Hewas despondent, surly and cross. He said that he had lost all hopeof anything curing him, and that he would rather go home deadthan to remain in that condition. Subluxation Caused Paralysis. We found a lumbar vertebra slightly displaced by a wrench. This subluxation occluded the left foramen, pinching the afferentand efferent nerves as they emerged from the spinal canal. Thispressure had the same effect on the nerves which convey im-pressions to and impulses from the brain, as a ligature around thearm would have on the fingers. We should use as good judgment inrelieving the affection of the leg as we would in relieving thebenumbed hand, by releasing the pressure on nerves made by theband around the arm. The discharge from the open wounds was condensed de- composed serum, which had ceased to circulate because theparalyzed nerves were unable to perform their functions. When thru with my examination and explanation, he said, \"I know there is something wrong there, for it feels like a pebblewould if under the foot.\" Feeling Returns. He took adjustments for five weeks. During that time we continued to replace the displaced vertebra, which had becomeirregular in shape. It had to be returned, grown to its normal figure,before it would remain in its former natural position. His rapturousdelight was unbounded when he found feeling and use returning tothat worse than useless limb. Returns Home Well. At the end of five weeks he took his satchel in his right hand, his crutches on his shoulder, and thanking Chiropractic for hisrecovery, returned home a happy man, and today is able to statethat he has no recurrence of his former trouble. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 PNEUMONIA. R. E. Hamilton, D. O., in The Journal of Osteopathy, under the head of \"Pneumonia,\" tells us \"How the Osteopath handles thecase.\" Do Chiropractors manage inflammation of the lungs in thesame manner as Osteopaths? Are Chiropractors faking Osteopathywhen they adjust displaced vertebrae, remove pressure fromnerves, restore normal temperature, pulse and respiration in fiveminutes? Dr. Hamilton says: \"The nursing and general care of the patient is very little different from that of any other school of 279THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC practice, but the treatment is based on the apparent cause of the attack. Weakness of the lung may be due to a lesion of the ribs, thedorsal or cervical vertebrae. Treatment must always be directed tothe removal of lesion found. Vigorous treatment should be givenonly in the first stage of the disease, the earlier the better. Thetrouble may be sometimes traced to the heart weakness and thecenters affecting the heart must be looked after. \"The centers for the kidneys and the intestinal tract should be examined, as lesions affecting these organs are quite frequentlyfound in pneumonia. Any measures, such as swathing the patient'sthorax with cotton, which will cause the blood-vessels near thesurface of the body to dilate, will help to relieve the congestion.\" He tells us that \"the apparent cause\" of the attack, as the disease was an enemy, had seized the patient, and assistance wasneeded to repel the intruder, may be found in lesions of the ribs,dorsal or cervical vertebrae, kidneys, intestinal tract, or heart.Chiropractic is specific; it locates the cause at one dorsal vertebra. Chiropractors look upon pneumonia as a misfortune, as the result of an accident, instead of an enemy, that should be fought. In Osteopathy the \"attack\" is successful, because the lung or heart is weak and not able to repel the invader. In Chiropractic, itis owing to an impingement of calorific nerves which supply thelungs with heat, creating an excessive amount. The Osteopaths \"treat\" such cases. The Chiropractors adjust causes. Osteopathy says, nutrition of the lungs, or the dilation and contraction of their blood-vessels are affected. Chiropractors findthat calorification has greatly increased. Osteopaths give vigorous treatment in the early stages of the disease. The Chiropractors give one energetic adjustment, which isdone by one move, not taking to exceed one-half minute. The Osteopaths are advised to look after and examine the nerve centers in the brain, spinal cord and ganglia, where the nerves ofthe organs originate. Chiropractors are taught to locate theimpingement in the spinal foramina. Dr. Hamilton advises any measures which will cause blood- vessels to dilate, because \"A free and natural flow of blood ishealth.\" Chiropractors do not believe that blood impeded bycontracted veins or arteries is the cause of disease. D. O.'s talk about lungs being congested. Chiropractors seek to know why they are inflamed. The pathological changes in tissue,altered nutrition of blood-vessels, circulation and exudation offluid is due to excessive heat. Wherein is there any resemblance between Osteopathy and Chiropractic in etiology and method of handling a case of pneu-monia? 280ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS We turn to page 111 of The Principles of Osteopathy, by E. H. Laughlin, D. O., and read: \"Relax the muscles along the spine,remove the lesion, treat the kidneys and bowels, relax all thecervical tissues, raise the clavicle and depress the first rib, treatalong the vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves near thesternomastoid muscle. For the fever treat the sub-occipital muscle,also inhibit the abdomen, stimulate the vaso-motor centers to thelungs, raise the lower ribs and stimulate the accelerators of theheart. To ease the rough treat the larynx and trachae.\" A. P. Davis, M. D., D. O., an Osteopathic student under the personal instruction of Dr. A. T. Still, says of pneumonia, on page434 in Osteopathy Illustrated: \"Capillary congestion, due to pressure, either on the venous system that carries blood out of thelungs, or on the nervous system that controls the peristalsis of themuscular walls of the blood-vessels, causes a difficulty. \"The most forcible indication points to taking off the pressure. This is done by following the general direction for freedom of thecirculation. \"We, therefore, begin on the vaso-motor area, give thorough general treatment, using the limbs as levers to lift the weights.\" Drs. Laughlin and Davis agree with Dr. Hamilton in the cause of, and method of relieving pneumonia. Their Osteopathicprinciples do not differ, yet there is nothing in them that isChiropractic. Where in pathology, or method of controllingpneumonia, has The P. S. C. copied Osteopathy? The only expression used, that looks like Chiropractic, is that of \"Taking off the pressure,\" by Dr. Davis, who tells us, incomprehensive language, to \"give thorough general treatment, totake off the pressure.\" He says, \"This is done by following thegeneral directions for freedom of circulation.\" Dr. Hamilton says, \"A free and natural flow of the blood is health, is an Osteopathic truism.\" To an Osteopath it is anundoubted, self-evident truth; a statement which is plainly true; aproposition needing no proof or argument. It is falsity to accuse Chiropractors of faking Osteopathy. There is a greater difference between Osteopathy and Chiropractic thanthere is in any two of the four state-protected schools of Iowa. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 POLYPI. Polypi are small tumors which grow outward from and are a part of the mucous membrane. They are usually found in theuterus, pharynx and nasal passages; occasionally in the stomach,intestines, bronchial and vagina. The 281THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC mucous membranes of any canal, cavity or hollow organ may be affected by them. They vary in size, number, mode of adhesion and structure. They may be hard or soft, fibrous or cancerous. They present allthe pathological conditions of tumors or larger growths. The usual means of treatment are astringent powders or so- lutions, cauterization, excision and extirpation. These are buttherapeutic remedies used to treat diseased conditions. Pimples, boils, polypi, tumors or cancers are the result of too much heat produced by excessive calorific mental impulse.Abnormal growths are due to too much action of expansive mentalimpulse. There is a new science that does not treat effects, but instead, adjusts the bones that are out of alignment. One case will serve forexplanation: Mrs. J. H. M. and her two children were visiting at her mother's home. Having adjusted her daughter, Morine, for diphtheria, bytwo adjustments, she desired me to adjust her son, Hugh, forpolypi of the nasal passages, which were so filled that he made aterrible fuss when asleep. Chiropractors find that polypi of the nasal cavities and pharynx are the result of impinged nerves between the cervical vertebrae. Ten adjustments of a cervical vertebra freed the impinged nerves, thereby removing the cause of these tumors. There was nolonger deranged functions producing abnormal effects. The polypibecame free from the membrane and were discharged. Proper adjustments have the same effect on larger tumors and cancers. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 RACHITIS. Rachitis, or rickets, is a disease characterized by crookedness of the spine and long bones, enlargement of joints, prominentabdomen, large head, leanness, general debility and indigestion.The most marked effect is the distortion of bones. It is frequently accompanied by consumption, dropsy, diarrhoea, convulsions, congestion and tonsils, hecticfever, and atrophy. Rickets is a disease of childhood, usually first noticed between the ages of six months and three years. If a child who is not ill, andwho has not suffered from exhausting disease, does not walk attwo years of age, it is probably rachitic. In most instances therachitic child begins to walk at some time during the 282ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS third year, and at this time the deformities of the lower extremities, such as knock-knee, bow-leg, flat-foot, usually develop and areobserved. Some cases show at birth signs of what appears to begeneral rachitis. The trunk is proportionally long as compared tothe stunted limbs, the head is large, the chest presents a pigeon-likedistortion and the epiphyses appear to be generally enlarged. Insome instances the back is curved into a rigid kyphosis orscoliosis, and restricted motion or apparent fixation of many of thejoints may be present. Such cases are no doubt intra-uterinerachitis and have their cause in the foetus before birth, or havebeen injured by the obstetrician at birth. Rickets is a defective calcification of bones when their growth is at its maximum, in consequence of which secondary changesoccur. The softened bones seem to show a diminution, a resorptionof earthy substances and an overgrowth of osteoid tissue. In thethird and last stage of this disease the softened bones becomeabnormally hard, eburnated. Fresh bone formation contains adiminished quantity of lime. After the active process ofdecalcification has ceased, then lime is deposited in the osteoidtissue; the result is a thick and heavy bone, prematuresolidification at the epiphysical junctions and eburnation follows,causing a dwarfing of the stature. While the bones are soft, bodilyweight and muscular action cause deformity of the bones bycurving and twisting. The skeletal frame is not only deformed, butstunted. Such persons, as a rule, do not reach average size in adultlife. Boyer says that rickety bones are lighter than natural, and of red or brown color. They are penetrated by many enlargedblood-vessels, being porous and, as it were, spongy, soft and com-pressible. All of the affected bones, especially the long ones,acquire a remarkable suppleness, but if they are bent beyond acertain point they break. Instead of being filled with marrow, themedullary cavity of the long bones contain only reddish serumtotally devoid of the fat or oily nature of the secretion in thenatural stage. Among the earliest signs of rachitis is enlargements of the wrists and ankles, called \"double joints.\" Enlargements are easilyfelt at the junction of the ribs and costar cartilages, named \"rachiticrosary.\" The child affected with rickets stands with the legs apart, the thighs flexed, the knees bent, the back arched and the shoulders arethrown back. The skull may be irregular in shape, some parts of itmay be too thick or too thin, too soft or too hard. These conditionsof the cranium are named craniotabes. The fontanelle isabnormally large and may remain open long after the usual time.Teething is often delayed or is irregular. The infant makes but littleeffort to stand or walk at the usual period. Bronchitis is a commonsymptom of rickets. Convul- 283THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC sions may occur at any time of the disease, especially when there is any tendency to craniotabes. Some writers think that rachitis is hereditary; that rickety children are born of rickety or scrofulous parents. Whitman says that distortions of the softened bones are caused by atmospheric pressure, the force of gravity, habitual postures,muscular action or injuries. Oppenheimer claims that malaria is the main cause of rickets. Bradford and Lovett say that debility from any cause that impairs nutrition may be the cause of rickets; that syphilis is anindirect cause. Whitman says richitis is a constitutional disease of infancy, caused by a weakness that may be inherited or it may be the directeffect of illness, improper hygienic surroundings, such as lack ofsunlight, damp rooms, overcrowding or poor ventilation. Thedirect cause of the disease is improper nourishment, due toartificial food during the nursing period, improper diet afterweaning, or of prolonged lactation, or a defective quality of themother's milk. Bradford and Lovett say, under the head of rachitis prognosis, when the disease is left to itself it generally runs its course andafter a decided degree of bony deformity has occurred the processof bone softening is spontaneously arrested, and the bones hardenin their deformed condition; that drug treatment is manifestlysecondary in importance to careful regulation of the diet andhygiene. One finds a long list of drugs which are advocated byvarious writers. Cooper says no medicine is known which possesses any direct efficacy in eases of rickets. Whitman says medical treatment is of secondary importance. It is unlikely that any drug has a very direct influence on the disease. Moore says a number of theories have been advanced as to the exact cause, but all are unproven. It is not hereditary. Young says that there is no evidence that the disease is ever transmitted. Tubby says that heredity plays no part in the production of rickets, nor does syphilis. Various theories have been advanced,and at present there is not one which will bear searching ex-amination. Cooper says the cause of rickets is involved in great obscurity. This disease is divided by Moore into three stages: Incubation, deformity and recovery. Tubby says that the bones in severe cases pass through three stages, that of congestion, of softening and of sclerosis. Young recognizes three changes which lead to deformity, that of congestion or invasion, softening or deformity, hardening orsclerosis. 284ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS are classed by orthopedists as forms of rachitis. It is a chronic inflammatory affection of the bones. They enlarge, soften and from weight or compression by muscles theybecome unnaturally curved and misshapen. Fragilitis ossium, oesteomalacia, senile rickets, is a disease of adult life characterized by absorption of the earthy substances ofthe bones and deformity. The early symptoms are pain in the pelvisand thighs when in motion. It is usually supposed to be ofrheumatic origin until the character of the affection is madeevident by weakness and deformities of the limbs. Bradford and Lovett say that nothing definite is known as to the cause of oesteomalacia. Whitman says of this disease, \"The etiology of the affection is unknown.\" Scurvy and infantile scorbutus are also forms of rickets. Congenital cretinism is a kind of rachitis. Intellectually and physically dwarfed. Born idiocy, physical degeneracy and de-formity, usually accompanied with goitre. Medical writers agree in that they do not know the primary cause of rickets. They know that malnutrition is at fault, but whatcauses the defective process of assimilation they are at a loss toknow. The P. S. C. is the first school to elucidate and bring to light the formerly unknown etiology of rickets. In Chiropractic, as elsewhere, the identical cause with the same conditions produces similar results. Rachitis is a name given to certain symptoms when associated together in the same person. These effects in different persons,although from the same cause, differ as to the nervous makeup ofthose who are affected. For be it known that no two persons looknor act alike, no two are alike in their formation of the bones,nerves or blood vessels. We differ more in our internal makeupthan in our external. Excessive heats, named fever by other schools, for a long period of time, soften and decalcify bones, take from them muchearthy matter, causing them to become friable and light, easily bentor broken. After the exorbitant amount of that heat has subsided,then diseased conditions, providing that the patient lives, runs tothe other extreme of eburnation. Remember that disease isfunctions performed in excess or not enough. Chiropractors understand how a vertebral subluxation can produce the various symptoms named rickets. They also under-stand that it may be made before birth, at delivery in infant, or adult life. 285THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC SMALL-POX. Small-pox and chicken-pox are one and the same disease. A bad case of chicken-pox is a mild case of small-pox. They differ indegree and symptoms as do all diseases in different individuals.All ailments are but the effects of abnormal expression of mentalimpulses. The quantity is diminished or increased, hence the lackof quality sufficient to maintain a normal. There is not an ache,pain or misery, but are the interpretations of impressions. All actsor movements of any or all parts of the body (including thecirculation of the fluids of the body), whether regular or irregular,normal or abnormal, are personifications of mental impulses. Whatdo reach periphery are normal, but the amount is the difficulty.There are no two of us that look alike, no two have the skeletalbones alike. No two whose impressions are alike, hence two kindsof interpretations, hence two different qualities of sensations. Ifthis is true in health, these differentiations are greatly increasedwhen the currents are made abnormal in expression by injury.Therefore, the symptoms of small-pox or chicken-pox vary from anundetermined mild case where there is little or no eruption toresemble small-pox where the eruptions run together. They are both acute, i. e., progress rapidly, and of short dura- tion. They are both \"self-limited,\" have a definite course and timeto run which is not modified by any mode of treatment. Themedical schools state that these diseases limit themselves; that noknown treatment will abbreviate or materially change their course;that certain symptoms will arise under treatments that are entirelyopposite. In other words, these self-limited diseases have theirallotted number of days to run under any and all kinds oftherapeutical treatment, because not one of these schools, whiletreating the symptoms, ever think of adjusting the cause. The spinal cord, as it emanates from the brain, contains all the nerves of the body. These nerves are distributed to various parts ofthe system passing out through openings along the sides of thevertebrae. These intervertebral foramina, or openings, are liable tobe changed in size and shape by various accidents which cause M.D.'s sprain. The vertebral column has fifty-two articular joints thatare liable to be displaced while we are asleep or awake. Duringsleep the nervous system is relaxed, there being no tension, thevertebral column is easily displaced by sudden movements duringfrightful dreams, causing displacements of some one of thevertebrae; for instance, the stiff neck upon arising and the suddenawakening in the night with a \"catch\" in the side. These acuteailments may be relieved by one adjustment, replacing thevertebrae to its normal position. While we are awake the vertebralcolumn is liable to be wrenched by innumerable accidents. 286ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS We have discovered that the continued use of stimulants, such as the smoking of cigars or cigarettes, the chewing of tobacco, thedrinking of alcoholic liquors, the use of opium, morphine orcocaine causes a Chiropractic subluxation. This displacementkeeps up the depraved appetite. The replacing of this subluxatedvertebra restores the current and returns the acquired diseasedcondition to normal. Now, may there not be a similar cause forsmall-pox? In all cases that are classed as such that we have hadthe privilege of examining, we have found a displacement of thefifth cervical, the replacing of which immediately returned allabnormal symptoms to normal. For explanation I give one case: During the smallpox scare in this city a few years ago the Atlantic hotel was quarantined forthree weeks on account of a woman that was discovered, directlyafter leaving the hotel, to have had small-pox. This case wasexamined by myself and three students. Some time afterward thelandlord's son was confined to his bed by the same disease, only ina much more aggravated form, and not desiring a repetition of theformer quarantine, called me. I found a well-marked case ofsmall-pox, and the fifth cervical displaced. I replaced thesubluxated vertebra, thereby relieving the pressure on the nerveswhich caused eruption and fevered condition named small-pox.The next day I found him free from the eruption and fever. On thethird day he was on the street, as well as ever. When it is generally known that a large share of diseases, including small-pox, are caused by subluxations of the vertebraeand that the replacing of these will reduce the temperature tonormal and cure the patient, then we will give the death blow tothe vaccine poison swindle. Then we will get rid of the Old SchoolSign Boards, such \"sprain is the result of a violent straining or twisting of the safe pants surrounding the joints.\" Any of the joints, including those of the backbone, are liable to be sprained from over-straining. This affection has been regarded by medical men as incomplete luxation, which we have named Chiropractic subluxation becauseof it being brought to a slight separation of two articular surfaceswhich have not returned to their normal position. Chiropractors would divide sprains into two classes, those simple wrenches of the joints that are common and get well in afew hours or days, and the chronic. These are the class of sprainsthat I desire to call your attention to, as they are serious and havefor their sequel some of the most grave forms of joint troubleknown to medical orthopedists. 287THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC The medical concussions of the spine are nothing more nor less than a sprain of the spinal column, a slight separation of thearticulations between the lateral processes, possibly of the inter-vertebral or even those between the heads of the ribs and vertebrae. It is a common remark that a sprain is often worse than a fracture. A fracture is properly replaced, the fragments are placedin apposition, the right thing is done; with the chronic cases ofsprains, rheumatism of a joint, the articular processes of thedisplaced bones are not replaced. Sprains of the various joints of the body, especially of the ankle and back, are quite frequent in railroad and other accidents. Herrick says that in spinal trouble local tenderness is not always prominent, while disturbances of sensation and motion areobserved. Moullin says that in all probability half of the crippled limbs and stiffened joints that are met with every day date their startingpoint from the occurrence of some apparently trivial sprain. It isthe popular impression that these accidents are almost invariablyfollowed by acute inflammation; rightly or wrongly, inflammationis nearly always regarded as the cause. It must be admitted thatthere is something very unsatisfactory in the results obtained bythe ordinary methods of treatment. Even when the greatest care istaken, when every precaution is used, tedious convalescence is therule, often the joint never recovers at all. He adds, \"Arnica, whichis frequently recommended, is worse than useless.\" One of the most singular features in connection with these sprains is the way in which the backbone is overlooked andignored. The vertebral column may be strained, especially in thecervical and lumbar regions, the small joints between the articularprocesses may be twisted and wrenched, disarranging the size andshape of the twenty-five foramina on either side of the spine thatgives passage to the nerves from the spinal cord, thereby creating adiseased condition named sprains, or rheumatism. Usually a smallarea along the spine, about the seat of injury, will be foundsensitive on one or both sides. A close examination will discoverthem made so by compression; they can often be traced by aChiropractor over portions of the body and out of the limbs wherestrange feelings are experienced, such as pain, crawling, creeping,tingling and other unpleasant sensations too numerous to mention.Such cases as Page has seen fit to call \"railway spine injuries,\"may be accounted for in this way. Instead of referring them toinjury of the spinal cord, they should be attributed to the spinalnerves which have sustained grave injuries at their exit. A summary of the medical treatment for the effects of a strain is as follows: Elastic stockinette, bandages, massage, plasterbandage, hot air, hot and cold water (depending upon whether it iswinter or summer), static electricity, adhesive plaster strap- 288ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS ping, elevation, rest, rubefacients, fixation, traction, liniments and poultices. A plaster of Paris jacket is used for sprains in the back. A Chiropractor should look for the cause of a chronic strain the same as he would for that of rheumatism. When he has traced thesensitive nerve from the diseased part to the foramen whereimpinged, he should release the imprisoned nerves by replacing thedisplaced articular surfaces. To use any of the above methodswould be to show his inability to adjust the cause. He is asdangerous to consult, or more so, than the surgeon, for he has haddrilling, whereas the self-mixed, so-called Chiropractic would dobungling and damaging work. One case will illustrate therapeutic treatment for effects and Chiropractic adjustment for causes. J. M., a man sixty years of age, came into our office on crutches. In answer to the question, \"Well, sir, what is the matterwith you\" he answered, \"Three years ago a cow kicked me on theleft ankle. I managed to walk to the house, but have not been ableto bear any weight on the foot since. I have tried several doctorsand many remedies, but nothing does it any good.\" I examined the ankle and found no displacement or local injury. By pressure above the ankle I discovered the hypersensitive nerveand followed it to the lumbar portion of his back. I tried to explainto him that at the instant of the kick he had jerked his leg awayfrom danger, thereby wrenching his backbone, displacing avertebra sufficiently to partially close the foramen through whichthe nerve passed, thereby placing a pressure on the nerve whichhad its ending in the ankle. He was not pleased with my explanation. In six months he returned. I remembered his case and found the afflicted nerve at itsexit and followed it to the ankle. He still insisted on my treatingwhere the ailment was, and not his back, which he thought was allright. I told him that I did not want to fool away his money and mytime. In three months he returned again. Throwing down a ten dollar bill he said, \"I might as well fool my money here as elsewhere.\" After one adjustment of the lumbar vertebra he bore con- siderable weight on his foot. In time he was able to discard hiscrutches. The following short article was in The Manistique Tribune of Friday, August 2, 1901. It states the facts as was resorted: TWO SURPRISES. \"While milking my cow three weeks ago I was kicked on the left side above the kidneys. The bruise, instead of getting well in afew days, as is usually the case, became a good deal worse. Itwould seem as though somebody was cutting the flesh open 289THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC from the hip to the ankle whenever I would step upon the left foot. I am sure a real knife cut could not have been more painful. \"The pain would start at the small of my back and run down my entire side and limb. I could do a little light work when seated at atable, I could sew at a table, but I could not sew on my sewingmachine, walk or milk my cows. If I started to walk the pain wouldbe so intense I would have to give up and go to bed. I had stomachtrouble and no appetite, ate very little; even what I ate distressedme terribly. \"I tried doctors, prescriptions, liniments, patent medicines, which gave me a little relief, but not a cure. \"One day my husband, engineer on tug Gifford, heard of a 'peculiar doctor' who was spending his vacation in Manistique.All he had heard was that he 'punched the back' for ninety-nineout of every hundred diseases. Upon investigation he found thatwhile the theory set forth was peculiar and entirely opposite toanything he had heard of before, yet it was so practical in itsapplication that he decided, as a last resort, to have him treat me. \"It was the examination given by B. J. Palmer that gave me my first surprise. He said the shock that I received from the accidentwas so severe that it luxated one of the lumbar vertebra of thespine, and that the misplacement was cutting off the supply ofthose nerves that ran to that side and limb; that those sensorynerves were partially dead for want of mental impulses. And aftertwo weeks, treatment it proved that the philosophy of the sciencecalled Chiropractic, was right. Although the druggists may laugh at their theories, they are well worth their investigation. \"I give Chiro all the credit for making me a well woman, which was my second, and by far my greatest surprise. \"I would advise anyone suffering with any acute or chronic troubles to investigate Chiropractic while B. J. Palmer is here.Owing to the fact that his vacation will be short, it will be well toinvestigate at once. He is stopping at Mt. G. K. Keils, on Riverstreet. MRS. WILL HAZEN, \"Garden Ave., Manistique, Mich.\" None but an experienced, specific, pure and unadulterated Chiropractor would have looked for the cause of these ankle andthigh affections in their spines, and only by the adjustment of suchwould he dismiss these cases colli, or corlum neck, and involuntary deviation of malposition of the headand neck, which are drawn awry, either laterally anterior orposterior. It may be, as classed by orthopedic surgeons, acute 290ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS or chronic, constant or intermittent, congenital or acquired. Lateral deviation is the most common and is generally accompanied bymore or less rotation of the head. Orthopedists recognize two different kinds of wry-neck, the congenital, which is inborn, the cause of which is not known bythem, and the acquired, caused by contraction of muscles, to whichI would add a third kind, caused by caries and changes made bycompression of the shape of the vertebrae named by Tubby rachitis torticollis, softening of the vertebrae. It is possible that fetal ricketsmay be associated with some cases of congenital torticollis. WithChiropractors all deformities are acquired; differing in degree andtime, whether prenatal or postnatal. Cooper says, wry-neck should not be confounded with a mere rheumatic tension and stiffness of the neck, nor with the faultyposition of the head, arising from deformity of the cervicalvertebrae. He recommends a division of the contracted muscles,unless the cervical vertebrae have grown in a distorted direction; ifso the deformity cannot be rectified. In most instances the deformity of the congenital torticollis is slight at birth, and may not attract attention until the child sits orwalks. Thus it is often difficult to distinguish the congenitaldeformity from that which has been acquired in infancy, especiallyif the distortion has persisted for many years. There is really onlythe difference of time at which the cervical displacement occurred. In early infancy slight torticollis may be demonstrated by holding the arm on the affected side and drawing the head forciblyin the opposite direction, when the shortened muscles becomeprominent beneath the skin, evidently restricting the range ofmotion. There ought to be no difficulty in deciding whether the case is one of congenital or spasmodic wry-neck. The real difficulty lies inascertaining the cause of the spasmodic form. In a few cases the deformity, even in infancy, may be extreme, showing well marked assymmetry of the face and distortion of theskull. Slight assymmetry may be present at birth, becoming moremarked with its continuance, exhibiting marked atrophy,micromegaly of the affected side. In long standing chronic cases,whether congenital or acquired, as the medical men would say,assymmetry of the face is rarely lacking. This fact emphasizes theimportance of having the misplaced cervical adjusted as soon aspossible after the distortion is discovered. The arresteddevelopment of the muscles, the affected half of the skull and faceis caused by a lack of proper functional currents in the efferentnerves conveying trophic mental impulses, the nerves of that halfbeing deprived of a portion of the normal amount of impulses byocclusion of the foramen thru which they emerge. 291THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Acute or rheumatic wry-neck is accompanied by soreness and pain. The condition usually improves in a few days, but it mayreoccur and finally become chronic. The pain is eased byimmobilization of the head and increased by any attempt to correctthe position. Tenderness may be felt over the articular spinous andtransverse processes about the third or fourth cervical vertebrae onthe scoliosis. Bradford and Lovett speak of the muscles on the affected side being shortened by disease from birth. From birth means that thecause was intra-uterine and existed before birth. Disease meanssymptoms or effects. Chiropractors desire to know that which isthe primary cause of the abnormal conditions; others say that in themajority of cases of congenital torticollis a difficult labor hasoccurred, during which the cervical and other vertebrae have beensubluxated. They give a Chiropractic sunbeam when they say,imperfections in the atlas and cervical vertebrae have in somereported cases been the cause of congenital torticollis. Traumatismto the neck and head is at times followed by torticollis; sometimesapparently due to direct injury to the muscles of one side andsometimes to the synovitis of the intervertebral joints. Dislocationof the upper cervical vertebrae is followed, if not corrected, bytorticollis. In chronic cases the intervertebral discs and bodies arepartly or wholly destroyed or made wedge-shaped, on whichosteophytes are formed, resulting in ankylosis of the vertebrae. Clark says, tubercular diseases of the cervical spine, whether in the atlo-axoid region or in the lower cervical vertebrae, may giverise to lateral as well as antero-posterior bending and to simulatewry-neck. In rare instances the head is bent backwards inatlo-axoid disease. Rachitis torticollis is due to yielding of thebones softened by rickets, more or less rigidity is present fromthese changes. Occasionally cases of wry-neck have troublesomeneuralgia from inflammation of the nerve trunks as they pass thruthe intervertebral foramina. Deviation of the spinal column is seenin this, as in other forms of torticollis. The cervical spine, in casesof congenital wry-neck, exhibits a scoliotic curve. The shape of thebones is so markedly altered that it alone accounts for thepersistence of the deformity. In some diseases we may have acute or chronic retracollis; that is, a drawing of the head backwards without lateral deviation. A compensatory lateral curvature of the dorsal portion of the spine may result from the cervical curvature. There may be convulsive contractions varying from an occa- sional jerk to an almost constant spasm. Pain is intermittent, as arule. Bradford and Lovett say that congenital torticollis may exist in connection with other deformities, such a club-foot and similarmalformations; that in these cases it seems proper to attribute itsexistence to those intra-uterine conditions causing the other 292ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS co-existing deformities. In other words, he means to say, that if we knew the conditions that caused club-foot and other deformities,we might reasonably conclude that wry-neck be caused by thesame. It has been reserved for The P. S. C. to discover these intrauterine conditions that cause prenatal distortions. It is, today,the only school teaching this important study, distinctlyChiropractic. Medical writers give many causes for wry-neck, the most prominent are the following: McCurdy says congenital wry-neck is caused by injury during parturition, and is always chronic, by which he means that it isincurable. Clark says that some cases of indurated wry-neck are due to inherited syphilis. There is no doubt that the abnormal attitudedepends upon reflex painful contractions of the cervical muscles.These do not explain to a Chiropractor, but when this same writersays that certain affections of the cervical spine, of articular orosseous origin, frequently cause wry-neck, then we think he hascaught sight of a Chiropractic sunbeam. Little says congenital wry-neck clearly originates from prenatal causes, acting thru the nervous system. McCurdy gives as causes of wry-neck, congenital torticollis, false position of the head during gestation, injury during partu-rition, and inherited syphilis. Acquired torticollis is a symptom ofdisease of direct nerve irritation, due to reflex nerve disturbancesfrom carious teeth, otorrhea, or excessive discharge of the ear. Young says the majority of so-called congenital cases occur at birth from injury. Other causes are deficiency of the cervicalvertebrae, malposition of the foetus in utero and heredity. He saysthat acquired torticollis results from blows, twists in the neck, ofthe sternal mastoid muscle and violence received during delivery.In rare cases fracture and dislocations of the cervical vertebrae. Tubby gives as probable cause, spinal caries, cicatrices, fallor blow malarial poison. Moore says that torticollis may be congenital or acquired. Congenital cases are doubtless due to injuries occurring at birth.These injuries may be due to muscles, nerves or nerve centers.Many traumatic cases have their origin at the time of birth, bonesmay be broken or distorted, nerves or nerve centers may be in-jured. Idiopathic cases are due to causes we do not fully under-stand. The bones and cartilages in extreme chronic cases may bechanged by pressure or atrophy. Whitman gives as the apparent exciting causes of acquired torticollis, toothache, cervical glands that are enlarged or sup- 293THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC purating otitis, collulitis, cold in head, vaccine, fever, injury to the neck, rachitis, syphilis and cicatrical contraction. Bradford and Lovett state that rickets, Pott's disease, injury to the nerve centers at the time of birth and nerve irritation may bethe causes, frequently no definite cause can be found to explainwry-neck. The chronic form may develop from the acute form. Itmay be a congenital distortion, or it may be of gradualdevelopment from any of the thirty-six causes here given, or fromno known origin. Chiropractors understand that all forms of wry-neck, whether prenatal or postnatal, are acquired; that is, they are as muchacquired when prenatal as when postnatal. We mean by this thatthere is a cause before birth, as much so as after. Chiropractorsbelieve that all effects have causes. In human anomalies we find instances of umbilical cords being of various lengths, even as long as five feet. Infants are often bornwith the funds wound around some portion of the body, causinguterine amputations of limbs and vertebral displacements.Congenital displacements of the cervical vertebrae are no doubt,often caused by the cord being wound around the neck. In foetallife the vertebral column is very easy and liable to be displaced. Asubluxation of the cervical vertebrae would cause the head to beawry and impinge the nerves passing thru those foramina whichare partially occluded. Bradford and Lovett say that congenital and the acquired forms are, of course, incurable without surgical interference. McCurdy says, in spasmodic torticollis spontaneous recovery seldom occurs. Under medical or electrical treatment little can beaccomplished. Recent methods of operative procedure have placedthis most obstinate deformity within the limits of curableaffections. The only effective means of curing congenital torti-collis is by myotomy of the contracted muscle or nerve resection. Clark says that the prognosis is always grave. The more severe cases require operative movement. We have quoted several standard authors on orthopedy to show that they differ very much as to the cause of torticollis. They givemore than fifty causes, the most of which are only associateconditions or symptoms. Several of these writers are honestenough to say there is no known cause. We will sum up what we have learned. Wry-neck is caused by an interference to the fullest expression of all functions in thecervical vertebrae; that subluxation may be before birth, after, or atbirth. The lesion consists in a partial displacement of the bodies aswell as the articular processes of the vertebrae. Distortedvertebrae, by their disarrangement, produce wry-neck. Thiscondition cannot exist without the articular processes separatingmore or less, in proportion to the displacement. This separation ofthe articular surfaces may be on one or both sides. If both 294ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS articular processes are equally displaced, we will have retrocollis or anterocollis. Where the cervical vertebrae are tilted to one sideand the articular process is displaced forward there will be aclosing of one foramen, with a corresponding opening of the other;the nerves that pass thru the occluded orifice will be pressed uponby the displaced articular process, causing them to be swollen andenlarged. This depletion of the nerve impulses produces anabnormal action, a contracted condition of muscles and draws thehead awry. The impingement of nerves, including excessivecombustion of osseous structure, may produce caries or a changein the shape of the vertebrae by muscular compression softened byexcessive heat. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 YELLOW FEVER. If yellow fever is conveyed from one person to another by the sting of a mosquito, where did the first yellow fever subject get thedisease? What caused the first case of yellow fever? Would not the same poison produce the same disease in all cases? This reminds me of an Irishman's cow. A lady having made the remark, in the presence of an Irishman, that she would like to owna cow giving milk, that had never calved, the Irishman, with hisready wit, replied, \"Bedad, madam, I have the cow you arewanting; she is now giving milk, and never had a calf; neither didher the inside surfaces of all hollow organs, canals or tubes that have an external opening. Serous membranes cover those cavities, internal and external, that do not open externally. The mucous membranes line the lids of the eyes, nasal passage, the auditory canal of the ear, the Eustachian tubes, the lips, allparts and sides of the mouth, the throat, the trachea (windpipe) andbronchial tubes, stomach, gall bladder, tubes of the pancreas andliver, the caecum and the appendix, the bowels and stomach downto and including the anus, the bladder, the uterus, the vagina, theureter and urethra. The serous membranes cover the brain, heart, chest, the abdomen, the pleura or outside covering of the lungs, theperitoneum that encloses the viscera of the abdomen. The mucous membrane has a mucous, slimy fluid. The serous membrane has a thin, watery fluid. 295THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC Some of the diseases of the mucous membrane are: granulations of the eyelids, rhinitis of the nose, catarrh of the ear catarrh of thelungs, which is an affection of the tubes of the lungs, generallyknown as tubercular consumption; catarrh of the inflammation of the appendix;diphtheria, and croup is an inflammation of the mucous membraneof the throat; and so on with the diseases of the bladder, the vaginaand uterus. In diseases of the serous membrane we have inflammation of the brain, causing sclerosis and mollifies, hardening and softening.These diseased conditions of the nerves in the soft tissues are thesame that we have been studying in the diseased bones. Of theheart, we have pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, theoutside membrane or covering, which forms a sack. This smoothmembrane is lubricated with a thin, watery liquid called serum.This lubricant prevents friction during its movements. If thismembrane becomes inflamed, we have inflammation of the heart,named pericarditis; the result is a tendency to produce and retaintoo much serum. This unusual amount of held-up serum is nameddropsy hydropericardium. The membrane that lines the heart onthe inside is liable to be inflamed. This condition is calledendocarditis. All the diseases of the mucous membrane and the serous membrane that we have noticed, and many more, have theirprimary cause in nerves that are producing too much heat,supplying too much to the membrane that is affected. What wehave just said in regard to the cause is as far as an M. D. woulddesire to go. But we Chiropractors ask what is the cause of thisundue amount of heat ? We find that if a nerve, or a bundle ofnerves are being pinched, that there is an abnormal effect ofpinched nerve or nerves; that it is too active or not enough. In thediseases noticed there was too much heat, too much action and toomuch life. Disease is extreme either way. Cancers come under the head of diseases of the serous mem- brane. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 FRACTURES OF THE SPINAL COLUMN. Stimson says fractures of the vertebrae are relatively rare, being about 5 per cent; they are extremely unusual in childhood and oldage. Fractures of the vertebrae are uncommon, even more so than the medical men suppose, for many subluxations are thought bythem to be fractures. Cooper says every kind of joint is not equally liable to dis- location. Experience proves that in the greater part of the vertebralcolumn luxations are absolutely impossible. 296ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Boyer has set down that luxation of joints with continuous surfaces is impossible. We must remember that when an M. D. speaks of a luxation of a vertebra, that he means a complete separation of its two articular surfaces, which is usually accompanied with fracture. Kirkland observes there are some luxations which are far worse injuries than fractures; of this description are dislocations of thevertebrae, which can hardly happen without fracture, and arealmost always fatal. Cooper remarks, the large surfaces with which the vertebrae support each other, the number and thickness of their ligaments,the strength of their muscles, and the vertical direction of thearticular processes make dislocation of the dorsal and lumbarvertebrae impossible, unless there be immense violence sufficientto cause fracture of the articular processes. It is certain that most ofthe cases mentioned by authors as dislocations of the lumbar anddorsal vertebrae have only been concussions of the spinal marrowor fractures of such bones. The os occipitis and first cervical vertebrae are so firmly connected by ligaments that there is no instance of their beingluxated from an external cause, and were the accident to happen, itwould immediately prove fatal by the unavoidable compressionand injury of the spinal marrow. We find, in Gray's Anatomy, that the many joints of which the spine is composed render it liable tosprains. Don't you forget that the M. D.'s sprain is the Chiropractor's subluxation. Gray continues: The ligaments that unite the component parts of the vertebrae together are so strong, and these bones are sointerlocked by the arrangement of their articulating processes, thatdislocation is very uncommon and, indeed, unless accompanied byfracture, rarely occurs, except in the upper part of the neck. Garrish, in his Anatomy, says: \"Simple dislocation, between two vertebrae, is almost impossible, unless perhaps in the cervicalregion, where the surfaces of the articular processes are morenearly horizontal. This is borne out in practice, where we findfracture-dislocation the common injury, the processes of neuralarch being commonly fractured, if not the body itself.\" In Vol. 2 of McClellan's Regional Anatomy, he says: \"Dis- locations and fractures of the spinal column are especially grave. Asimple dislocation of any of the vertebrae can happen only in thecervical region, as the construction of the dorsal and lumbarvertebrae is such that a dislocation necessarily involves a fractureof some part of the bone. Even in the neck a dislocation isextremely rare. Fractures due to direct violence usually involveonly the vertebral arches, the bodies escaping unhurt.\" From these quotations of standard authors, you will readily see that the medical profession does not recognize luxation of 297THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC any one of the fifty-one articulations of the spinal column. They think that such can only occur as a result of fracture, then theyrefer to a complete luxation and not to a Chiropractic subluxation. The bodies may be fractured, obliquely, transversely, or longi- tudinally; it may be simple, comminuted, or impacted. The injurymay concern one or more vertebrae. The body may be crusheddriving a portion of it into the spinal cord. The differentialdiagnosis of fracture and displacement must usually remain indoubt, for they each present similar symptoms, there being nocrepitus to decide. The prominent sign of spinal fracture is traumatic kyphosis, a displacement with a wound and an abnormal mobility of thefragments. Herrick says: \"It is impossible for any twist, or shake-up, to have sufficient force to fracture any of the vertebrae or theirprocesses, yet direct violence of a blow on the back, or fallingacross some projection, may cause it.\" Beck thinks that fracture of the spinous and transverse proc- esses are extremely rare. Helferich speaks of fracture of the vertebral bodies being extremely rare, that of the laminae with spinous and transverseprocesses not common. Beck says that fracture of the transverse processes are still rarer than that of the spinous processes, and their recognition isextremely difficult on account of the thick muscular layer protect-ing them. From an examination of our large collection of vertebrae we find the healed fractures of the spinous and transverse processes tobe quite frequent and about twice the number of the latter as of theformer. Stimson is of the opinion that fractures of one or more of the vertebral processes, either of the same or the adjoining vertebrae,are common. Howe says that the breaking of the tip end of a spinous or transverse process is not serious. With which I fully agree, becausesuch a fracture does not change the shape nor the size of theforamina thru which the nerves pass where they are liable to beimpinged. Cooper informs us that a fracture of the upper cervical or of the odontoid process is always suddenly fatal. Gould and Pyle observe that injuries of the cervical vertebrae, while extremely grave, and declared by some authors to be in-evitably fatal, are, however, not always followed by death or per-manently bad results. Fracture of the lower part of the spine is notalways fatal, and notwithstanding the lay idea that a broken backmeans certain death, patients with well authenticated cases ofvertebral fracture have recovered. 298ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS Stimson thinks that the fifth and sixth cervical, the last dorsal, and the first lumbar are more frequently broken than any of theothers. The fragments of a fractured vertebrae should be repositioned as near as possible. This will of necessity need careful work and athorough knowledge of the anatomical construction of thevertebral column. The nurse will need to be very careful inchanging the patient's position so that the fragments will not bedisturbed until they are thoroughly secured by being healed, owingto the cancellous condition of the bodies of the vertebrae, threemonths may be necessary for consolidation of the fracture. Wherethere is a fracture of the processes only, mobilization may not benecessary. In youth the epipyses of the spinous processes are liable to become separated and absorbed, causing them to appear shortened,giving the impression to the uninformed that of an anteriorluxation. An examination of the transverse processes will showthat they are in line; therefore, the processes are not displaced. The diameter of the spinal cord and spinal nerves are considerably less than that of the canal and foramina in which theyare located. The spinal cord ends at the first or second lumbarvertebrae, but the cauda equina of nerves continue to distribute thenerve fibers, so that partial occlusion of the vertebral canal or theforamina does not of necessity cause death. Gould and Pyle state that injury to the spinal cord does not necessarily cause immediate death. Mills and O'Hara record instances of recovery after penetrating wound of the spinal marrow. There is a vast difference in impaction of the bodies of the vertebrae which only occur when the bone is in a normalcondition, and that of compression when the softened bones havebeen compressed against each other, changing the shape of theinter-vertebral cartilage as well as that of softened waxy bodiesforcing a portion out on one or more sides or posterior in the spinalcanal. Fractures may be the primary cause of softening a part or all of one or more vertebrae, by impinging the nerves, thereby creatingan excessive beat as they pass out of the occluded foramina. The importance of fractures of the vertebrae to a Chiropractor depends upon the associated injury that is very liable to occur bythe occlusion of the spinal canal or its foramina. Where changes in the size and shape of the vertebral canal or its foramina are caused by fracture or displacements, the results arethe same, either of which is very likely to impinge the cord or thenerves emerging therefrom. If the vertebrae are deformed by impacted fracture, there will be kyphosis or scoliosis. 299THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC PNEUMONIA AND EMPHYSEMA. On February 14 I received a telephone call from Milan, Illinois. I responded; found a rig waiting to convey me ten miles to the homeof Mrs. C., a lady eighty-one years of age. I found her suffering forthree weeks from pneumonia and emphysema of both lungs.Temperature 103-1/2. Respiration short and rapid, confined to theupper portion of the lungs. Prognosis unfavorable, because of ageand of fever having greatly reduced her vital force. One dorsal adjustment lowered the temperature in one hour to normal. Respiration was diaphramatic in one and a half hours. Shethen slept two hours. The crisis had passed, there was now noimmediate danger. No more adjustments were needed or given forthe inflammatory condition of the lungs. Five more calls were made to relieve her of catarrhal conditions of the stomach. The family was so well pleased with the result that Kenneth Burns, a nephew of Mrs. C., is now a student at The P. S. C. Report received today (March 12) states that Mrs. C. is gaining in strength, resting nicely, and no return of fever. In the above case there was a chronic condition of the stomach known as catarrh. This lack of innervation was due to animpingement of nerves in a foramen on the left side of the spine.Such produced excessive heat in the peripheral ending in thestomach of the digestive nerves, thickening the mucus of the mu-cous surface by drying. Similar conditions were the cause of the abnormal heat of the lungs, only that the occluded foramen was higher in the dorsal. Acute diseases are relieved by one or two adjustments; whereas, chronic cases take more time, because of changes madein the osseous structure. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \"ONE DISEASE FOR ANOTHER.\" \"Adversity makes strange bed- fellows,\" says: \"Two Mexican scientists have discovered that thetapeworm prevents the organism from being infected with tu-berculosis bacilli. To establish the efficiency of the remedy thephysicians injected the live cure into several patients, all of whomrecovered.\" The tapeworm eats the tuberculosis bacilli. That is the Allopathic conception of ridding the body of disease. War. A fight on hand. One disease to combat another. Allo\u2014one, and pathy\u2014disease. One disease for another. 300ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS DRUNKENNESS. A copy of the following was sent to Deed and Double. We thought it good enough for reproduction in The Chiropractor: Editor of Deed and Double: Please allow me to further explain, by relating one case, in order to show how displacements of thespine may cause an abnormal appetite for strong drink. In our adjustments for stomach troubles, patients occasionally report a change of appetite. It is a well-known fact that manypersons, upon recovery from disease, find a change in their likesand dislikes for food and drink. In Chiropractic, not \"Chiropractice,\" we find nerves control all functions, appetite being one of them. That function may bederanged, the appetite abnormally increased or decreased, or acraving for unusual substances. The call for stimulants being oneof them. On one occasion, H. A. came to me to be adjusted, i. e. have a displaced vertebra replaced, an impingement taken from thenerves; the spinal foramen was occluded, lessening the size of theopening through which certain nerves emerged. It is a Chiropracticfact that undue pressure on nerves deranges their action andsensation. At the fourth adjustment he said, \"The odor coming from a saloon always had an inviting effect, so much so that I sometimescould not resist the desire of going in and taking a drink; then Iwas in for a drunken spree. But now that smell is nauseating,repellent, instead of inviting.\" This case is but one of many which I might refer to. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 IS CHIROPRACTIC ADJUSTMENT PERMANENT ? Why is it necessary to give daily adjustments upon the same vertebra for several weeks? If placed into position once, whydoesn't it stay? These questions must be definitely answered by showing what keeps the vertebra out of place and what change must take place tohold it in position after proper adjustments have been given. I thinkDr. Palmer is able to explain this in a scientific manner so that weunderstand the principles and also prove by examples from his. Iwill be pleased to have this answered in The Chiropractor. This question can be answered in two ways: By comparison and scientifically. The last Chiropractor gave two crude illustrations of everyday experience. That answer was intended for the laity,which would not be satisfactory to a Chiropractor or a scientificinvestigator. 301THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC To intelligently pursue the study of why vertebrae remain out of position for weeks, months or years and why one week or threemonths, adjustments are necessary to correct its position, itbecomes necessary to have a large osteological collection ofabnormal vertebrae under all manners of conditions. Fractures,osteomalacia, fevers, caries, and many other diseases and theirsubsequent abnormal or accommodating qualifications, must bestudied to their fullest thoroughness. For this purpose The P. S. C . has the largest collection of abnormal specimens of the vertebralcolumn in the world. No Chiropractic education is complete when minus Chiropractic Orthopedy. When we speak of a vertebra being subluxated, we refer to its being partially separated, more or less, from the one above orbelow. As to whether posterior, anterior, left or right lateral,depends upon which one we refer to. The various curvatures, scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis are made by a great diversity of several abnormally-shaped vertebrae,which cannot be studied without appropriate specimensrepresenting each kind. Add to these those varying in consistencyfrom the softness of cheese, in osteomalacia, to those as hard asivory in specimens which have become eburnated. A part or all of the vertebral column may be softened by superheat, a portion of the bone may ooze out and be deposited onthe surfaces, by fusion, causing morbid enlargement and an-kyloses. When the heat becomes less than normal, hardening,consolidation and eburnation follow. Each of the following need special attention: Fractures, exostoses, ankyloses, and carious vertebrae. They make wedge-shaped specimens. It might be lateral or antero-posterior indirection. Then exostoses may, in addition, lock vertebrae in theseconditions. This wedge-shape may be slight or great, needing aseries of adjustments accordingly. The first few gradually make theankyloses give way. The time needed to achieve this may cover aperiod of one or two weeks, perhaps longer, during which thepatient has improved but little, if any. Why? You have not, as yet,separated the two vertebrae that are pinching nerves. The exostosisbroken, the normal position is soon reached, pressures released,health follows. Exostoses and ankyloses are interesting studies. They are removed by appropriate adjustments, the how and the why ofwhich must be thoroughly understood before starting a case, if not,serious damage often results. Vertebrae which have been fracturedcannot be returned to normal position. Many so-called fractures ofthe spine are severe subluxations which a competent Chiropractorcan adjust and correct. The M. D., calling it fracture, does notmake it so. He has no knowledge of subluxations or their attendantsymptoms. Vertebrae destroyed by caries can be returned to normal shape. Chiropractors are the first school that claims and proves 302ITS PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS by demonstrations that this can be fulfilled by intelligent ad- justment of its cause. It is interesting, to a pathologist, to note the various changes and shapes of the different parts of the vertebrae, of the adaptationto some displacement which Innate was not able to adjust, and thephysician did not know how. This intelligence displays much andvaried intellect in the many locks found in the vertebral column toprevent the further displacement of an already subluxated vertebra,one of which is as nice a dovetail as any artificer could make. Verymany times we find vertebrae ankylosed by osseous symphyses forthe purpose of preventing further displacement. Innate is not amechanic, therefore, cannot replace them. The above conditions are found in the majority of chronic cases, in more or less condition. All acute diseases can be im-mediately corrected \"While you wait,\" because the vertebrae arenot deformed in shape or consistency. Let this subluxation standpermanently, followed by a combination of symptoms, and thechange in shape is inevitable. To correct this is what necessitates afew weeks' adjustments. The replacing, once, of a chronicsubluxation does not hold it; continued work returns the oldnormal shape, hence, the return to natural position. Health is thepositive result. To intelligently pursue the right course, the Chiropractor must know what condition exists in every case before he commenceswork. His diagram of procedure must be previously arrangedEvery graduate of The P. S. C. has had most thorough drilling in examining and studying hundreds of such specimens each of whichis made practical by describing the etiology, analysis andprognosis and how to attain it by the intelligent application ofcertain Innate principles which previously had been interferedwith. 303THE SCIENCE OF CHIROPRACTIC EVERY DAY DICTIONARY.
