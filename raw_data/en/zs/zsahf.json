Without treatment, discoid eczema can last for weeks, months or even years. It may also keep coming back - often in the same area that was affected previously. Symptoms of discoid eczema Discoid eczema causes distinctive circular or oval patches of eczema. It can affect any part of the body, although it does not usually affect the face or scalp. The first sign of discoid eczema is usually a group of small red spots or bumps on the skin. These then quickly join up to form larger patches that can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size. On lighter skin these patches will be pink or red. On darker skin these patches can be a dark brown or they can be paler than the skin around them. Initially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. They also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night. Over time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky. The centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of discoloured skin that can be mistaken for [ringworm](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/r/article/ringworm/). You may just have one patch of discoid eczema, but most people get several patches. The skin between the patches is often dry. Patches of discoid eczema can sometimes become infected. Signs of an infection can include: - the patches oozing a lot of fluid - a yellow crust developing over the patches - the skin around the patches becoming hot, swollen and tender or painful - feeling sick - feeling hot or shivery - feeling unwell When to seek medical advice See a pharmacist or GP if you think you may have discoid eczema. They can recommend a suitable treatment. You should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may be infected. You may need to use [antibiotic](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/a/article/antibiotics/) cream or, in severe cases, take antibiotics as a tablet or capsule. A GP should be able to make a diagnosis just by examining the affected areas of skin. In some cases they may also ask questions or arrange some tests to rule out other conditions. A GP may refer you to a doctor who specialises in skin conditions (dermatologist) if they're unsure of the diagnosis or if you need a patch test. Causes of discoid eczema The cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it may happen as a result of having particularly dry skin. When your skin is very dry it cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it. This could allow a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate your skin. It's important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin. [Contact dermatitis](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/c/article/contactdermatitis/), a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may have a role in discoid eczema. Some people with discoid eczema also have a history of [atopic eczema](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/e/article/eczema(atopic)/), which often happens in people who are prone to [asthma](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/a/article/asthma/) and [hay fever](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/h/article/hayfever/). However, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families. Other possible triggers An outbreak of discoid eczema may sometimes be triggered by a minor skin injury, such as an [insect bite](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/i/article/insectbitesandstings/) or a [burn](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/b/article/burnsandscalds/). Some medicines may also be associated with discoid eczema, as patches of eczema can appear in people taking: - interferon and ribavirin - when they're used together treat [hepatitis C](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/h/article/hepatitisc/) - tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) blockers - treat some types of [arthritis](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/a/article/arthritis/) - [statins](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/c/article/cholesterolloweringmedicines,statins/) (cholesterol-lowering medication) - which can cause dry skin and rashes Dry environments and cold climates can make discoid eczema worse, and sunny or humid (damp) environments may make your symptoms better. Treating discoid eczema Discoid eczema is usually a long-term problem, but medicines are available to help relieve the symptoms and keep the condition under control. Treatments include: - [emollients](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/e/article/emollients/) - moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry - [topical corticosteroids](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/c/article/corticosteroidpreparations(topical)/) - ointments and creams containing a steroid that are applied to the skin and may relieve severe symptoms - [antihistamines](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/a/article/antihistamines/) - medicines that can reduce itching There are also things you can do yourself to help, such as avoiding all the irritating chemicals in soaps, detergents, bubble baths and shower gels. Additional medicine can be prescribed if your eczema is infected or particularly severe. Occasionally, areas of skin affected by discoid eczema can be left permanently discoloured after the condition has cleared up. Read about [treating discoid eczema](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/e/article/eczema(discoid)/#Treatment). Other types of eczema Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin. Other types of eczema include: - [atopic eczema](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/e/article/eczema(atopic)/) (also called atopic dermatitis) - the most common type of eczema, it often runs in families and is linked to other conditions such as [asthma](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/a/article/asthma/) and [hay fever](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/h/article/hayfever/) - [contact dermatitis](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/e/article/eczema(contactdermatitis)/) - a type of eczema that happens when the skin comes into contact with a particular substance - [varicose eczema](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/e/article/eczema(varicose)/) - a type of eczema that usually affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins Treatment There is no simple cure for discoid eczema, but medicines can help to ease the symptoms. Treatments include: There are many different preparations for each type of medicine and it is worth taking time with a pharmacist or GP to find the best one for you. A range of emollient products, soap substitutes and some topical corticosteroids can be bought from pharmacies without a prescription. Some of them are cheaper to buy this way than with a prescription. Ask a pharmacist for advice on the different products and how to use them. See a GP if your eczema does not improve after using an over-the-counter product. Self-help tips There are also some things you can do yourself that may help to control symptoms of discoid eczema, such as: - avoiding soaps and detergents, including liquid soaps, bubble bath, shower gels and wet wipes - even if these don't obviously irritate your skin; use an emollient soap substitute instead - protecting your skin from minor cuts (for example, by wearing gloves) as cuts may trigger discoid eczema - taking daily lukewarm baths or showers - using an emollient when washing may reduce your symptoms, and remember to apply skin treatments soon afterwards - not scratching the patches of eczema - keeping your hands clean and your fingernails short may help reduce the risk of skin damage or infection from unintentional scratching - making sure you use and apply your treatments as instructed by a GP or pharmacist See your GP if you think your skin is infected. For example, if there's excessive weeping or tenderness in the patches of eczema. Infection can spread quickly, and the use of topical corticosteroid creams can mask or further spread the infection. Emollients [Emollients](https://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/e/article/emollients/) are moisturising treatments you apply directly to your skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema. Choice of emollient Several different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find 1 that works for you. You may also be advised to use a combination of emollients, such as: - an ointment for very dry skin - a cream or lotion for less dry skin - an emollient instead of soap - 1 emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different 1 to use on your body The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between. Creams and lotions tend to be more suitable for swollen (inflamed) areas of skin. Ointments are more suitable for areas of dry skin that are not inflamed. If you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may become less effective or may start to irritate your skin. If this is the case, a GP will be able to prescribe another product. How to use emollients Use your emollient all the time, even if you are not experiencing symptoms, as it can help prevent the return of discoid eczema. Many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school. To apply the emollient: - use a large amount - do not rub it in - smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows - for very dry skin, apply the emollient every 2 to 3 hours, or more often if necessary - after a bath or shower, gently dry your skin and then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moist If you are exposed to irritants at work, make sure you apply emollients regularly during and after work. Don't share emollients with other people. Side effects Occasionally, some emollients can irritate the skin. If you have discoid eczema, your skin will be sensitive and can react to certain ingredients in over-the-counter emollients. If your skin reacts to an emollient, stop using it and speak to your GP or pharmacist who can recommend an alternative product. Emollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath. Topical corticosteroids To treat the patches of discoid eczema, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid, which you apply directly to your skin, to reduce inflammation. Choice of topical corticosteroid There are different strengths of topical corticosteroids that can be prescribed depending on the severity of the eczema. Discoid eczema usually needs a stronger type of corticosteroid than other types of eczema. You might be prescribed a cream to be used on visible areas, such as face and hands, and an ointment to be used at night or for more severe flare-ups. How to use topical corticosteroids When using corticosteroids, apply the treatment accurately to the affected areas. Unless instructed otherwise by a doctor, follow the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine. Do not apply the corticosteroid more than twice a day. Most people only have to apply it once a day. To apply the topical corticosteroid, take the following steps: - Apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes, until the emollient has soaked into your skin, before applying the topical corticosteroid. - Apply enough of the topical corticosteroid to cover the affected area, but try to use the smallest amount possible to control your symptoms. - Use the topical corticosteroid until the inflammation has cleared, unless otherwise advised by a GP Speak to your prescriber if you have been using a topical corticosteroid and your symptoms have not improved. Side effects Topical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them. In rare cases, they may also cause: - thinning of the skin - changes in skin colour - [acne](http://111.wales.nhs.uk/Encyclopaedia/a/article/acne/) (spots) - increased hair growth Most of these side effects will improve once treatment stops. Generally, using a stronger topical corticosteroid, or using a large amount, will increase your risk of getting side effects. You should use the weakest strength and the smallest amount possible to control your symptoms. Steroid tablets If you have a severe flare-up, your doctor may prescribe [steroid tablets](https://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/s/article/steroidtablets/) to take for up to a week. If steroid tablets are taken often or for a long time, they can cause a number of side effects, such as: For this reason, a doctor is unlikely to prescribe repeat courses of steroid tablets without referring you to a specialist. Antibiotics If your eczema becomes infected, you may also be prescribed an antibiotic. Oral antibiotics If you have an extensive area of infected eczema, you may be prescribed an antibiotic to take by mouth. This is most commonly flucloxacillin, which is usually taken for 1 week. If you are allergic to penicillin, you might be given an alternative such as clarithromycin. Topical antibiotics If you have a small amount of infected eczema, you will usually be prescribed a topical antibiotic, such as fusidic acid. These medicines come as a cream or ointment that you apply directly to the affected area of skin. Some topical antibiotics also contain topical corticosteroids. Topical antibiotics should usually be used for up to 2 weeks as necessary. Antihistamines [Antihistamines](https://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/a/article/antihistamines/) are a type of medicine that stop the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. Your body often releases histamine when it comes into contact with an irritant. Histamine can cause a wide range of symptoms, including sneezing, watery eyes and itching. Antihistamines may be prescribed during flare-ups of discoid eczema to cope with the symptom of itching, particularly if it is interfering with your sleep. However, they will not treat the damaged skin. Many older types of antihistamines can make you sleepy (drowsy), which can be useful if your symptoms affect the quality of your sleep. Otherwise, ask a pharmacist or GP to recommend a \"non-sedating\" antihistamines. Complementary therapies Some people may find complementary therapies, such as herbal remedies, helpful in treating eczema, but there's little evidence to show these remedies are effective. If you're thinking about using a complementary therapy, speak to a GP first to ensure the therapy is safe for you to use. Make sure you continue to use other treatments a GP has prescribed. Further treatments If the treatments prescribed by a GP are not successfully controlling your symptoms, they may refer you for assessment and treatment by a doctor who specialises in skin conditions (dermatologist). Further treatments that may be available from a dermatologist include: - phototherapy - where the affected area of skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light to help reduce inflammation - bandaging - where medicated dressings are applied to your skin - immunosuppressant therapy - medicines that reduce inflammation by suppressing your immune system "}
