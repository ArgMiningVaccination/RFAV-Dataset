General characteristics The AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine is composed of DNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 protein S, which is contained in a chimpanzee adenovirus capsule. The adenovirus with the DNA that integrates it enters the cell through endocytosis. Once inside the cytoplasm, the DNA is released and migrates to the cell nucleus where it is transcribed creating mRNA that encodes protein S. Subsequently, this mRNA is translated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum where protein S is created in the cytoplasm, processed and finally, presented by immune and non-immune antigen-presenting cells [ [Joseph Angel De Soto, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.15520/ARJMCS.V7I01.246) ]. The AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine is composed of a replication-deficient recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1-S) vector, encoding the SARS-CoV2 spike (S) glycoprotein. The spike protein in the vaccine in trimeric pre-fusion conformation. Adenoviruses are unencapsulated icosahedral particles (virions) copy of the double-stranded DNA genome [ [WHO, 2021](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/339474/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-AZD1222-background-2021.1-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) ]. Ingredients The vaccine contains the following ingredients: Active ingredient One dose (0.5 ml) contains: COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S recombinant), not less than 2.5 \u00d7 108 infectious units (Inf.U), which corresponds to 5 \u00d7 for injection Risk considerations The AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine uses a non-replicating and non-integrating platform. This means the vaccine component does not interact with the genome and does not carry a risk for infection [ [Antrobus RD, 2014](https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(16)31190-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS152500161631190X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) ]. Adenoviral vectors are frequently used for gene transfer because of their high cellular transduction efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Expression of viral proteins and the low capacity for foreign DNA limits the clinical application of first- and second-generation adenoviral vectors. Adenoviral vectors with all viral coding sequences offer the prospect of decreased host immune responses to viral proteins, decreased cellular toxicity of viral proteins and increased capacity to accommodate large regulatory DNA regions [ [Lundstrom K, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13020317) ]. In most cases, third generation replication-deficient adenoviral vectors with deletions in genes E1 and E3 have been use for the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or their receptor binding domain (RBD) [ [Lundstrom K, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13020317) ]. The ChAdY25/ChAdOx1 is a recombinant E1 E3-deleted vector developed a decade ago based on the chimpanzee adenovirus Y25. The vector was constructed in a bacterial artificial chromosome and demonstrated comparable immunogenicity to that of other species of chimpanzee adenovirus vectors. The prevalence of virus neutralizing antibodies against ChAdY25 in serum samples collected from human populations was particularly low compared to published data for other chimpanzee adenoviruses [ [Dicks MD, 2012](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040385) ]. Dosing and schedule The AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine is administered as a series of two doses (0.5 mL each) with an interval of 4 to 12 weeks between the two doses according to the manufacturer's product label. WHO recommends an interval of 8-12 weeks between the 2 doses since efficacy and immunogenicity increase with a longer interdose interval [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. The pharmaceutical form is a suspension for intramuscular injection that is presented in multidose vials of 2, 8 or 10 doses (0.5 mL per dose) [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine-chadox1-s-recombinant-0) ]. The preferred site of injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. If administration of the second dose is inadvertently delayed beyond 12 weeks it should be given as soon as possible. Booster dose [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ] A booster dose is recommended for the highest and high priority-use groups (e.g. older adults, health workers, persons with comorbidities), administered 4-6 months after completion of the primary series. Once high booster dose coverage has been achieved in the highest priority-use group, countries may also consider a booster for other lower priority-use groups. If more than 6 months have elapsed since completion of the primary series, a booster dose should be given at the earliest opportunity. Heterologous schedule [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ] All different manufacturers (AstraZeneca-Oxford Vaxzevria/SK Bioscience/SII COVISHIELD) are considered equivalent and interchangeable for completing a primary vaccination schedule. WHO supports a flexible approach to using different EUL COVID-19 vaccine products for different doses (heterologous schedule), and considers a total of 2 doses of any combination of EUL COVID-19 vaccines (e.g. 1 dose of ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] vaccine, and 1 dose of another EUL COVID-19 vaccine) to be a complete primary series. A heterologous booster with mRNA-based or protein subunit EUL COVID-19 vaccines (i.e. Pfizer-BionTech, Moderna, or Novavax), given 4 to 6 months after completion of the primary series with the ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] vaccine, provides a higher immunogenicity and vaccine effectiveness compared to a homologous booster. ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) vaccine can be used as a booster dose after completing a primary series using any other EUL vaccine platform COVID-19. No data are available on the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) with ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) vaccine used as a heterologous booster. Heterologous vaccination (primary series or booster doses) should only be implemented with careful consideration of current vaccine supply, vaccine supply projections, and other access considerations, alongside the potential benefits and risks of the specific products being used. Vaccination schedule for immunocompromised persons [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ] WHO recommends and extended primary series including an additional (third) dose for immunocompromised persons, administered 1-3 months after the second dose in the standard primary series. A booster (fourth) dose administered 3-6 months after the additional (third) dose should be considered for immunocompromised persons. Indications and contraindications Indications The AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine is indicated for individuals 18 years and over [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Contraindications The AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of the AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. (See the list of ingredients under 'General characteristics' in the extended version). The second dose of the vaccine should NOT BE GIVEN to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose of AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine. People who have had thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following the first dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine should not receive a second dose of the same vaccine [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Precautions Allergic reactions Persons with a history of anaphylaxis to any other vaccine or injectable therapy should be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination in health care settings where anaphylaxis can be immediately treated. In general, persons with an immediate non-anaphylactic allergic reaction to the first dose (such as urticaria, angioedema or respiratory symptoms, that occur within 4 hours of administration) should not receive additional doses, unless recommended after review by a health professional with specialist expertise. Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome A very rare syndrome of blood clotting combined with low platelet counts, which is described as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has been reported around 3 to 21 days following vaccination with the ChAdOx1-S vaccine. A causal relationship between the vaccine and TTS is considered plausible although the biological mechanism for this syndrome is still being investigated. There is a considerable geographical variation regarding the reported incidence since most of these cases were notified from the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU) and very few from non-European countries, despite the extensive use of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine in these countries [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Evidence suggest that the risk of TTS is lower following the second dose of ChAdOx1-S vaccine than after the first dose. It is currently unknown whether there is a risk of TTS following a third dose. The benefit-risk ratio is greatest in older age groups as the risk of severe COVID-19 disease outcomes including COVID-19 related thromboembolic events increases with age. Current evidence does not suggest that pregnant women are at any greater risk of TTS than nonpregnant women. However, pregnancy is associated with higher rates of thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. In countries with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the benefit of vaccination in protecting against COVID-19 far outweighs the risks. However, benefit-risk assessments may differ from country to country. As data from additional studies become available, enabling a better understanding of the pathophysiology of TTS and its relationship to the vaccine, recommendations on vaccination will be updated. [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Neurological events Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) has been reported very rarely following vaccination with ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] vaccine. However, a causal relationship with the vaccine has neither been confirmed nor ruled out and more rigorous studies are needed to fully assess the significance of these events. Based on the available data, the potential benefits of the ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] vaccine continue to outweigh any potential risk of GBS, particularly given the increase in the more transmissible variants. Health workers should be alert to possible signs and symptoms of GBS to ensure timely and accurate diagnosis (or to rule out other causes) and management of potential cases [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Pregnancy Available data on vaccination of pregnant women are insufficient to assess vaccine efficacy or vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. WHO recommends the use of AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women only if the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information about the risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy, the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiologic context, and the current limitations of the safety data in pregnant women [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Breastfeeding Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding women as in other adults. AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine is not a live virus vaccine and it is biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child. Based on this considerations, WHO recommends the use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine in breastfeeding women as in other adults [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Children and adolescents [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. There are limited data on the efficacy or safety of persons below 18 years of age for this vaccine. Until more data are available, vaccination of individuals in this age range is not routinely recommended. Older persons [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Vaccination is recommended for older persons without an upper age limit Persons living with HIV Persons living with HIV who are well controlled on highly active antiretroviral therapy should be vaccinated. It is not necessary to test for HIV infection before administration of the vaccine [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection Vaccination may be offered regardless of a person's history of symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. The optimal time interval between a natural infection and vaccination is not yet known. An interval of 3 months could be considered [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Persons with current acute COVID-19 Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19, including between doses, should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for discontinuation of isolation have been met [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Persons who previously received passive antibody therapy for COVID-19[ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ] Although some reduction in vaccine-induced antibody titers has been observed in this group, the balance of benefits versus risks favors vaccination. Other precautions EMA recommends that individuals who have previously had capillary leak syndrome must not be vaccinated with Vaxzevria (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca). Healthcare professionals should be aware of the signs and symptoms of capillary leak syndrome and of its risk of recurrence in people who have previously been diagnosed with the condition. Vaccinated individuals should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience rapid swelling of the arms and legs or sudden weight gain in the days following vaccination. These symptoms are often associated with feeling faint (due to low blood pressure) [ [EMA, 2021](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/vaxzevria-ema-advises-against-use-people-history-capillary-leak-syndrome) ]. As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals with bleeding disorders or other conditions that increase the risk of bleeding, such as anticoagulant therapy, thrombocytopenia and hemophilia [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/sites/default/files/documents/smpc-azd1222-en.pdf) ]. Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with an acute febrile illness (body temperature over 38.5\u00baC) until they are afebrile [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Co-administration with other vaccines For adults, COVID-19 vaccines may be administered concomitantly or at any time before or after other adult vaccines, including: live attenuated vaccines, inactivated, adjuvanted, or non-adjuvanted vaccines [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. When administered concomitantly, the vaccines should be injected at separate sites, preferably different extremities [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. Storage and logistics Storage AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine is provided as a refrigerated solution for intramuscular injection stored at 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) to 8\u00b0C to between 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for up to 6 month prior to first use [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine-chadox1-s-recombinant-0) ]. The shelf-life of vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd of up to 9 months stored between 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine-chadox1-s-recombinant-covishield) ]. Do not freeze. Keep vials in outer carton to protect from light. Administration logistics The vaccine should be inspected visually prior to administration. The vaccine is a colorless to slightly brown, clear to slightly opaque solution. Discard the vial if the solution is discolored or visible particles are observed. Do not shake the vial [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/sites/default/files/documents/smpc-azd1222-en.pdf) ]. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 mL is withdrawn into a syringe for injection to be administered intramuscularly. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual. Ten-dose vial: When low dead volume syringes and/or needles are used, the amount remaining in the vial may be sufficient for an additional dose. Where a full 0.5 mL dose cannot be extracted, the remaining volume should be discarded. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/sites/default/files/documents/smpc-azd1222-en.pdf) ]. Storage after first puncture After taking the first dose from the multidose vial, the vial should be used within a maximum of 6 hours (stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C [36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F]) or discarded at the end of the immunization session, whichever comes first [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1) ]. To facilitate the traceability of the vaccine, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded for each recipient [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/sites/default/files/documents/smpc-azd1222-en.pdf) ]. Administration 1. Using aseptic technique, clean the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic swab. 2. Use a 3 mL reuse prevention syringe (RUP) or a 5 mL RUP syringe, and a 21G or narrower needle. 3. Gently invert the vial to mix, and withdraw the 0.5 mL dose. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full 0.5 mL dose, discard the vial and the remaining volume. 4. Administer the vaccine intramuscularly, preferably into the deltoid muscle. Do not administer the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously, or intradermally. Discard the unused vaccine within 6 hours of opening the vial. Disposal Due to the high risk that discarded vials of COVID-19 vaccines may be recovered, it is essential that they are guaranteed to be safely disposed of at the site of use; or study the possibility of applying reverse logistics, if the safe treatment and disposal of vaccine residues cannot be guaranteed, so that they are transferred to the place established for that purpose. Otherwise, consider the possibility that the discarded vaccine vials are shredded, if there is a safe way to do so [ [WHO, 2021](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/339561) ].

Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness Efficacy of preclinical studies on the vaccine Van Doremalen et al. [ [van Doremalen N, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2608-y) ] conducted a study in mice and rhesus macaques. The vaccine elicited a robust humoral and cell-mediated response in mice, predominantly Th1. In rhesus macaques, vaccination induced a balanced Th1/Th2 humoral and cellular immune response. Vaccinated animals challenged with SARS-CoV-2 did not develop pneumonia and presented a reduced viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lower respiratory tract tissue compared with control animals. There was no difference in nasal shedding between vaccinated and control animals. Lambe et al. [ [Lambe T, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-133970/v1) ] conducted a study using rhesus macaque and ferret challenge models. In rhesus macaques, the lung pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 mediated pneumonia was reduced by prior vaccination which induced neutralizing antibody responses after a single intramuscular administration. In ferrets, the vaccine reduced both virus shedding and lung pathology. Antibody titers were boosted by a second dose. Silva-Cayetano et al. [ [Silva-Cayetano A, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.medj.2020.12.006) ] demonstrated that the vaccine induced both cellular and humoral immunity in adult and aged mice using in-depth immunophenotyping to characterize the innate and adaptive immune response induced upon intramuscular administration of the vaccine in mice. A single dose generated spike-specific Th1 cells, Th1-like Foxp3+ regulatory cells and granzyme-B-producing CD8 effectors. A second dose enhanced the immune response in aged mice. Graham et al. [ [Graham S.P., 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41541-020-00221-3) ] compared the immunogenicity of one or two doses of the vaccine in both mice and pigs. A single dose induced antigen-specific antibody and T cells responses. A booster immunization enhanced antibody responses with a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers. Van Doremalen et al. [ [Neeltje van Doremalen, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.09.426058) ] conducted a study in Syrian and rhesus macaques. Intranasally vaccinated hamsters exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus with the D614G mutation in the spike protein, significantly decreased viral load in comparison to controls. No viral RNA or infectious virus was found in lung tissue, both in a direct challenge and a transmission model. Efficacy of the vaccine in clinical trials Main Immunogenicity outcomes The combined results of 17,178 participants analyzed in the COV001, COV002, COV003 and COV005 trials (8597 receiving AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine and 8581 receiving control vaccine) [ [Voysey M, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00432-3) ] showed antibody levels were maintained by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 0.66 [95% CI 0.59 to 0.74]). In the participants who received two standard doses the binding antibody response after an interval of 12 or more weeks in those who were aged 18-55 years was GMR 2.32 [2.01 to 2.68]). The D8110C00001 [ [Falsey AR, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2105290) ], was a phase 3 randomized trial, that included 34,117 participants who received the AstraZeneca / Oxford COVID-19 vaccine or placebo. Participants that were seronegative at baseline showed a large vaccine-induced serum IgG response to spike protein. Neutralizing antibody levels were higher than baseline at different measurement points in the vaccine group, increasing further after the second dose. However, they remained low throughout the trial in the placebo vaccine group. ICMR / IBS-COVISHIELD was a phase 2/3 randomized trial, which included 1601 participants who received the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine or the Serum Institute of India (ISS) COVID-19 vaccine. The trial included the immune response of the participants. Results showed that in the immunogenicity/reactogenicity cohort (n = 401) baseline anti-S IgG antibody titers were <100 (AU)/ml in the SII and AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine groups. One month after the first dose (day 29), the GMTs were >6600 AU/ml in both groups, and one month after the second dose, the GMTs were >28500 AU/ml in both groups, this means that there was a 325-fold increase in antibody titers in both groups compared to baseline. In both vaccine groups, >91% of participants demonstrated seroconversion after the first dose and 98% demonstrated seroconversion after the second dose. These means that ISS COVID-19 vaccine showed a non-inferior immune response compared to the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine [ [Prasad S. Kulkarni, 2021](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3901791) ]. Sobieszczyk ME et al was a phase 3 randomized trial that included 26,145 participants included in double-blind period: 17,617 vaccine group and 8,828 placebo group. The primary efficacy end point was confirmed SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase PCR-positive symptomatic COVID-19 at 15 or more days after a second dose in baseline SARS-CoV-2-seronegative participants. Participants who received AstraZeneca and were seronegative at baseline showed strong vaccine induced serum antibody responses to the spike protein. Median SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies titers at day 1 were 20.0 for vaccine group and 20.0 for placebo group. Median SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies titers at day 57 were 254.5 for vaccine group and 20.0 for placebo group.

In other words, 18 less people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 1.8%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 by 1.8 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome.

Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as moderate certainty evidence. Mortality The existing evidence does not allow to assess the impact of AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine on the risk of death attributable to COVID-19. The information provided by randomized trials was not adequately powered to estimate a difference in this outcome. Deaths can occur in the intervention and control group for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 or the vaccine. Establishing that there is a reduction (or increase) in the risk of death attributable to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine would require trials with a higher statistical power.

Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as low. The certainty of the evidence is based in the following judgments: Risk of bias: no concerns; Inconsistency: no concerns; Indirectness: the information available is based on a short term follow-up; Imprecision: the information provides from a small sample; Publication bias: no concerns. Contracting COVID-19 (female) (measured at least 14 days after the second injection) The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 in female subgroup in the group that received AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.41 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.59).

This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 0.8%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 in female subgroup by 0.8 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTB is 125. Which means that 125 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not contract COVID-19. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as low. The certainty of the evidence is based in the following judgments: Risk of bias: no concerns; Inconsistency: no concerns; Indirectness: the information available is based on a short term follow-up; Imprecision: the information provides from a small sample; Publication bias: no concerns. Contracting COVID-19 (male) (measured at least 14 days after the second injection) The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 in male subgroup in the group that received AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.35 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.46). This means AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 in male subgroup in 65%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: contracting COVID-19 in male subgroup. Comparison: AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 118 people not receiving AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine out of 4814 presented this outcome (25 per 1000) versus 84 out of 9885 in the group that did receive it (9 per 1000). In other words, 16 less people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 1.6%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 in male subgroup by 1.6 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTB is 63. Which means that 63 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not contract COVID-19.

Summary of findings (iSoF) Efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccine in subgroups Sex Randomized trials The proportion of females in the combined analysis of COV002 and COV003 was 60.5% (7045 out of 11636 participants) [ [Voysey, Merryn, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1) ]. The magnitude of the effect was similar between the subgroups, and there was no statistical evidence of a subgroup effect by sex Age Randomized trials The proportion of patients >55 years of age in the efficacy population of the combined analysis of COV002 and COV003 was 12.2% (1418 out of 11636 participants) [Voysey, Merryn, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1) ]. The efficacy in the 18-55 years group in the different trials, doses and administration schedule ranged from 59.3% to 65.6%. These results were no statistically different from the efficacy of the vaccine in the overall group [ [Voysey, Merryn, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1) ]. Efficacy estimates for different age have not been yet reported. The researchers plan to present them in future analyses when a larger dataset is available [ [Voysey, Merryn, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1) ]. Other comparative studies Lopez Bernal et al. conducted a case-control design study in the United Kingdom [ [Jamie Lopez Bernal, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.21252652) ] evaluating all adults aged 70 years and older (over 7.5 million) from December 2020 to February 2021. Vaccination with a single dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic SARS-CoV2 positive cases in older adults with even greater protection against severe disease. The vaccine effects were seen from 14-20 days after vaccination reaching effectiveness of 60% (95% CI 41-73%) from 28-34 days and further increasing to 73% (95% CI 27-90%) from day 35 onwards. Vasileiou et al [ [Eleftheria Vasileiou, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3789264) ] found that the effect of a single dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine would prevent hospitalization related to COVID-19 when restricting the analysis to those aged 80 years (81%; 95% CI 65 to 90 at 28-34 days post-vaccination). The VIVALDI study included 1317 samples from 402 residents and 632 staff fully vaccinated (AstraZeneca=593; Pfizer=534). Data were collected 21 days after the second dose. The study showed that two-dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine elicits robust and stable antibody responses in older Long-Term Care Facility residents, consistent with overall levels of vaccine-induced immunity. [ [Oliver Stirrup, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.26.22269885) ] Elsie MF Horne et al was a comparative cohort study conducted in United Kingdom that estimated vaccine effectiveness of two doses of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines (versus no vaccine) in participants aged 18 to 64 and over 65 years. Hazard ratio for positive SARS-CoV-2 test (40-64 years years) was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96). Hazard ratio for positive SARS-CoV-2 test (>65 years) was 0.23 (0.53 (95% CI, 0.39-0.71).

COV005 was a phase 1/2 randomized controlled trial conducted in Africa. In this ongoing trial, people with HIV and HIV-negative participants aged 1865 years were enrolled at seven South African locations. Between June 24 and Nov 12, 2020, 104 people with HIV and 70 HIV-negative individuals were enrolled. For SARS-CoV-2 seronegative participants at baseline, full-length spike geometric mean concentrations (GMC) at day 28 was 163.7 (95% CI, 89.9-298.1) in the HIV group, and 112.3 (95% CI, 61.7-204.4) in HIV-negative participants, with a rising response in GMC at day 42 in both groups [ [Madhi SA, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2352-3018(21)00157-0) ].

Spensley K et al. included 1121 patients on haemodialysis. All patients underwent weekly screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection via RT-PCR testing between December 1, 2021 and January 16, 2022. The study showed that partial vaccination did not provide protection against infection. Vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection in patients who had received a booster vaccine was 58%. Analysing vaccine effectiveness in the 747 patients who had been boosted, significant effectiveness was seen in both patients who received AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (47%)and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (66%). Lin et al conducted a sub-analysis of a previous non-randomized clinical trial [ [Sheng WH, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2022.02.020) ] which compare the immunogenicity of heterologous ChAdOx1/mRNA-1273 versus standard homologous ChAdOx1 and mRNA-1273 vaccination. 399 participants were enrolled, there were 100, 100, 100, and 99 participants undergoing ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1 8 weeks apart (Group 1), ChAdOx1/mRNA-1273 8 weeks apart (Group 2), ChAdOx1/mRNA-1273 4 weeks apart (Group 3), and mRNA-1273/mRNA-1273 4 weeks apart (Group 4), respectively. The majority of the enrolled participants were 50 years with 74.7% being women. Among participants undergoing prime vaccination with ChAdOx1, compared with healthy participants aged 50 years, participants with immunocompromising conditions, had similar anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers before booster (geometric means, 75.36 = 0.429). However, numerically lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers before booster vaccination were found in participants with autoimmune diseases compared to those without (geometric means, 34.76 vs. 84.25 BAU/mL; P = 0.173). The participants receiving hydroxychloroquine, low-dose statistically significantly lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers before booster vaccination compared with those not receiving (geometric means, 36.39 vs. 83.84 BAU/mL; P = 0.001), especially in those receiving hydroxychloroquine (geometric means, 38.48 vs. 82.97 BAU/mL; P 21.96 82.90 BAU/mL; P < 0.001). The participants receiving also had statistically significantly lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers before booster vaccination compared with those not receiving (geometric means, 39.04 vs. 83.15 BAU/mL; P = 0.007), especially in those COX-2 selective NSAIDs (geometric means, 27.88 vs. 83.49 BAU/mL; P < 0.001) [ [Lin KY, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2022.08.017) ]. Chambers et al. conducted a test-negative study to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-COV-2 infection among a population-based cohort of people with HIV in Ontario, Canada. Among 21,023 adults living with HIV, there were 801 (8.3%) test positive cases and 8,879 test-negative controls. Adjusted VE against any infection was 77% (95% CI 34-92) for ChAdOx1 primary schedule or mRNA-1273).

The study included 358,431 individuals in the analysis of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine: 126,531 in the case group and 231,900 in the control group. The study assessed the effectiveness of three vaccines (rAd26-rAd5, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and BBIBP-CorV) on SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk of death in people with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19, using data from the National Surveillance System (SNVS 2.0). All individuals aged 60 years or older reported to SNVS 2.0 as being suspected to have COVID-19 who had disease status confirmed with RT-PCR were included in the study. The odds ratio of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with only one dose was OR 0.6 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.61). After the second dose was OR 0.32 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.33) [ [Rearte A, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00011-3) ]. Fano V et al was a comparative cohort study conducted in Italy.

The additional booster dose was delivered with the AstraZeneca or mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. Efficacy was measured by the difference in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion rate between patients vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine (heterologous) and the mRNA vaccines (homologous) at the fourth week. The results demonstrated that seroconversion rates at week four were comparable between patients who received the AstraZenaca vaccine (6/27 patients, 22%) versus the mRNA vaccines (9/28, 32%) (p = 0, 6). Overall, 27% of the patients seroconverted; furthermore, no serious adverse events related to immunization were observed [ [Michael Bonelli, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.05.21263125) ].

The study enrolled 340 participants, 83 allocated to receive a Pfizer booster, 85 received a Moderna booster, 85 received half dose Moderna booster and 85 received a MVC-COV1901 booster. Neutralizing antibody titers and Anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike binding antibody levels 28 days following after booster dose vaccination were assessed. Compared with pre-boost, all study vaccines elicited significantly higher anti-Spike IgG at 28 days post-boost. The fold-rise ranged from 8.4 in MCVCOV1901 group to in mRNA1273 group. [ [Chuang CH, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2022.105328) ] Behrens et al. conducted a longitudinal monitoring of ChAd/ChAd (n = 41) and ChAd/BNT (n = 88) vaccinated individuals and the impact of a third vaccination with BNT. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG (anti-S IgG) levels were significantly higher in the ChAd/BNT group short after prime-boost vaccination when compared to the ChAd/ChAd group but declined significantly over time in both groups, with lower anti-S IgG after homologous vaccination prior to the third immunization. Following a third immunization, they found greatly increased anti-S IgG responses in both groups. Additional immunization of the homologous ChAd/ChAd immunized group led to a significant 46.9 -fold increase in anti-S IgG (p<0.0001). In both groups, anti-S IgG levels were considerably higher when compared to the situation observed 14 days after the second vaccination (the third vaccination diminished previous differences between the heterologous ChAd/BNT and homologous ChAd/ChAd prime-boost vaccination groups, since anti-S IgG were comparable in both groups after the third vaccination). The numbers of spike-specific memory B cells generated after prime-boost vaccination gradually increased during the following months with no significant difference between the ChAd/ChAd and the ChAd/BNT group, in line with increased amounts of spike-specific antibodies, highlighting the impact of the third vaccination for better protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. 2 weeks after a third immunization with BNT, spike-specific memory B cells were significantly higher in the ChAd/ChAd as compared to the ChAd/BNT prime-boost group. The frequencies of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in blood samples collected after the second vaccination were significantly higher in the ChAd/BNT than in the ChAd/ChAd group. Both cell populations declined over time after heterologous immunization, while they remained at low levels after homologous vaccination. Whilst spike-specific CD4+ T cells declined to frequencies similar to individuals after homologous ChAd/ChAd vaccination, spike-specific CD8+ T cells remained above the frequencies of the heterologous vaccinated group. A third immunization with BNT in the ChAd/ChAd group significantly raised numbers of spike-specific CD4+ T cells above levels observed after the second vaccination. A third vaccination with with BNT did result in an expansion of spike-specific CD8+ T cells above levels observed after second vaccination in ChAd/ChAd vaccinated individuals Like for spike-specific CD4+ T cells, raised numbers in spike-specific IFN--producing T cells in the ChAd/ChAd was confirmed by cytokine measurement in Niyomnaitham S et al was a randomized clinical trial conducted in Thailand.

No cases of death or obvious clinical signs in the vaccinated groups were observed. In rhesus macaques, there were no pathological changes in the lungs [ [van Doremalen N, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2608-y) ]. Safety of the vaccine in clinical trials Key messages AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine did not increase the risk of adverse events. AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine did not increase the risk of serious adverse events. Main safety outcomes of AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine Any adverse event (1 to 3.4 months) The relative risk of any adverse event in the group that received AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 1.05 (95% CI 0.54 to 2.03). This means AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of any adverse event in 5%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: any adverse event. Comparison: AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine versus control vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 4297 people not receiving AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine out of 22517 presented this outcome (191 per 1000) versus 12157 out of 33608 in the group that did receive it (200 per 1000). In other words, 9 more people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk increase of 0.9%, or that the intervention increased the risk of any adverse event by 0.9 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTH is 111. Which means that 111 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to experienced any adverse events. Applying the GRADE approach, we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Serious adverse events (1 to 3.4 months) The relative risk of serious adverse events in the group that received AstraZeneca-Oxford/SK Bioscience/Serum Institute of India COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.87 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.07). No statistically significant differences between groups were found for serious adverse events. Applying the GRADE approach, we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Summary of findings (iSoF) Safety of the vaccine in subgroups Sex Randomized trials The proportion of females in the combined analysis of COV002 and COV003 was 60.5% (7045 out of 11636 participants) [ [Voysey, Merryn, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1) ]. The subgroup effect in safety outcomes has not been reported in the trials.

COV006 was a phase 1/2 participant-blinded, randomized controlled trial evaluating the safety in children 6-17 years old. Participants were randomly assigned in a 4:1:4:1 ratio to receive two doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine or control. Pain and tenderness were the most common local solicited adverse events for all the Astrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine and capsular group B meningococcal arms following both first and second doses. For systemic solicited adverse events, fatigue and headache were the most commonly reported with higher proportions reported in the Astrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine arms compared with capsular group B meningococcal arms. The increase in systemic reactogenicity was less obvious after 48 hours post-immunisation. For participants receiving Astrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine, there were fewer reported solicited adverse events after the second dose than the first dose [ [Li G, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00770-X) ].
