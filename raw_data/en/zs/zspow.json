Executive Summary, Conclusions and Recommendations Throughout most of the life of the OLS Live stock Programme, conventional wisdom held that rinderpest eradication from southern Sudan was not possible without peace. It was not until 1998, that the extent of the impact of the OLS Livestock Programme and the true potential of community -based vaccination using heat -stable vaccine was widely appreciated. As a result, the er adication of rinderpest from so uthern Sudan has not been a stated objective until relatively recently. There is now an emerging consensus among non-governmental organizations, international agencies and th e cattle owners of southern Sudan that the OLS Livestock Programme has been highly successful in cont rolling rinderpest in the south Sudan. There is also a realisation that the time for institutionalised vaccination has now passed. Eradication, although not certain under the prev ailing security conditi ons, is a realistic aspiration. The eradication phase of the programme shoul d be implemented in a consultative manner to insure that organisations and communities in volved continue to share in the ownership of the undertaking. Ownership of the eradication strategy by all pa rtners is essential to its success. Dialogue is required between the st akeholders to design and adopt a disease surveillance strategy and identify time-bound vaccination targets. Information from livestock owners and or ganisations on the gr ound suggest that the cessation of vaccination and intens ification of surveillance in ar eas West of the Nile is an appropriate and prudent ne xt step. The situation East of th e Nile is less clear. Historically, this area has not benefited from the same le vels of activity as the West and community- based infrastructure is much less developed. This has primarily resulted from problems of intermittent access and a consequent decision to focus resources West of the Nile as part of a phased programme. At the present time, the Sobat Basin is di fficult to access for either vaccination or surveillance. At the time of writing, OLS has indefinitely suspended all NGO activities in large areas of the Sobat Basin. Further to the south, the largest communities in the region, the Murle and Toposa, have only recently been accessed to any significant degree. A shortage of information is not equivalent to the absence of disease. Building disease surveillance capacity, and conducting participatory disease searches should be the main priorities. Time-bound vaccination should continue within the Mu rle and surrounding communities, when and where it can be properly applied. In this ma nner, at the end of the 2001-02 dry season, sufficient data will be in hand to support an informed decision rega rding the cessation of vaccination East of the Nile. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 2Conclusions and Recommendations: 1. The mission did not find direct evidence supporting the reports of a recent major epidemic of rinderpest in the Kengen River system. There was considerable evidence that rinderpest has been circulat ing in the southern portion of the East Nile Ecosystem within the last two years. Further, there is considerable indirect evidence that rinderpest is still present East of the Nile. This evidence includes wide spread-rumours, descriptions of e ndemic disease patterns, and the priority that the Murle and Karamojong cluster communities place on rinderpest. 2. The professionals of the OLS livestock pr ogramme have considerable skill in the use of participatory techniques to collect data on the epidemiology of disease. They have had insufficient experience in data analysis and in deriving best-bet scenarios from the information they collect. Training was provided to counterparts on the interpretation of result s during the course of the mission. Data analysis should be a stated component of surveillance officer's duties. 3. Field data indicated that rinderpest in southern Suda n was moderately virulent with mortality ranging between 26 and 62%. The length of the inter-epidemic period was the primary determinant of the severity of outbreaks. 4. Based on serological information in the literature and small sample sets collected by OLS from unvaccinated populations, it was possible to estimate the basic reproductive number for rinderpest (R o). The estimated values ranged between 3.5 and 5.3. The most likely value was taken to be 4.4. 5. The threshold level of herd immunity re quired for interrupting the transmission of rinderpest in large populations lies between 71 and 81% for the estimated range of Ro. In small populations, stochastic (chance) effects result in fade-outs at lower herd immunity levels. 6. In large populations, par tial vaccination coverage can contribute to the establishment or maintenance of ende mism. This concept was explored and demonstrated through the development of a stochastic SEIR model for rinderpest during the course of the consultancy. 7. The cattle population of southern Sudan is highly structured and should not be considered as having a homogeneous c ontact rate. The trib es and clans of southern Sudan should be considered as a series of interlinked subpopulations with attenuated contact ra tes between groups. It is not necessary to achieve uniform herd immunity rates in all co mmunities to eradicate disease and global interpretations of vaccination coverage are misleading. 8. In terms of husbandry systems and inte rnal contact rates, the major cattle populations of southern Sudan share many si milarities. It is suggested that the main risk factor that distinguishes commun ities in regard to rinderpest risk is lack of access to services due to security concerns. The OLS Livestock Programme has always operated within the c ontext of windows of opportunity. 9. Vaccination coverage in southern Suda n is reaching less than 10% of the estimated cattle population. However, were vaccination is being practiced it is highly focused. Seromonitoring has consis tently shown herd immunity rates of over 70% in communities where vaccination is practiced. This approach removes Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 3sub-populations from the overall pool of susceptible sub-populations and has contributed positively to the eradication of rinderpest. 10. The East Nile Ecosystem should be divide d into two sub-systems: the Sobat Basin and the South East Nile Ecosystem centr ed on the Kengen River area. The Sobat Basin should be defined as the Nuer a nd Dinka communities on both banks of the Sobat. The South East Nile Ecosys tem should include all communities in southern Sudan east of the Nile and to the south of the Nuer. 11. Emphasis must now shift from vaccination to surveillance. Remaining vaccination efforts should be highly targeted and time-bound. Vaccination should only be practiced where good access is available a nd 80 to 90% coverage is feasible. The need to continue vaccination should be critically reassessed at the end of the 2001-02 dry season (April 2002) in light of the results of surveillance activities. Dialogue on the cessation of vaccination should be carried ou t with the NGOs and communities. Ownership and the reality of a time-bound eradication strategy must be brought home. 12. As part of the eradication strate gy, communities should be identified and categorized according to risk factors such size, contact structure, interaction with neighbouring communities and degree of accessibility. Three categories are proposed: vaccination and surveillance, surveillance, and limited access communities. As a point of departure fo r dialogue, the following classification is suggested for communities East of the Nile: Vaccination and Surveillance Communities: Toposa, the Sobat Basin and the Pibor Murle 13. Where vaccination occurs, it must be intensive and focused. In areas where vaccination is practiced, a resident progr amme should be established. The practice of staff managing several sites through intermittent visits has not been effective. 14. In southern Sudan, rapid response strate gies are problematic. The OLS Livestock Programme exploits windows of opportunity. A rapid re sponse capability implies that access is flexible and at the disc retion of campaign managers. Aggressive eradication strategies that rely heav ily on rapid response capability are not adapted to the reality of southern Sudan. 15. Considerable activity with the Murle, Jie and Kachipo is now feasible from Boma as a result of the construction of the br idge over the Kurun River. Security and access are good. It is an important cent re for rinderpest surveillance and vaccination activities. This window of opportunity should be utilized. 16. Cattle raiding has been a constraint to serv ice delivery in the southern part of the East Nile Ecosystem. Although it does not normally place OLS Livestock Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 4Programme staff in danger, it hampers access to cattle across community lines by restricting the movement of counterpart st aff and frequently causes cattle camps to seek out more remote locations. In the past, raiding has all but eliminated access to the Murle from towns such as Pa luer, Pochalla and Akobo. It is strongly recommended the OLS Livestock Program me consider introducing conflict resolution activities. It is suggested that peace meetings are held between the Anuak, Jie, Kachipo, Murle, Niagatom a nd Toposa. Increased access to livestock service delivery, among other services, shoul d be presented as one of the benefits of peace. 17. As new communities are accessed, purposive serosampling to detect the circulation of rinderpest should be carried out as a matter of priority. It is recommended that at least 5 to 10 herds be sampled with a total sample of at least 200 animals. In the Murle, this should be done before any vaccination is carried out. 18. The general disease reporting system is functioning well and reports of stomatitis- enteritis are being received and investigate d. The primary source of reports is the community-based animal health network. 19. Comprehensive participatory disease search es to identify the date of the last rinderpest outbreak should be carried out in all of the principal communities east of the Nile during the 2001-02 dry seas on. Between 30 and 50 interviews should be conducted per community. The results should be tabulated and examined for patterns by qualitative methods. The combination of participatory epidem iology and quantitative disease modelling used in this consultancy has contribute d to rinderpest stra tegy development by clarifying the dynamics of rinderpest in th e region. The use of existing veterinary knowledge as expert opinion combined w ith epidemiological parameter estimates from more conventional sources has allowe d the construction of mathematical and conceptual models that illustrate the impact of control activities. This approach can be further develope d through model experimentation with the present models and the continued developm ent of a structured population model. The collection of more data on community struct ure and contact rates would contribute to this effort. The approach developed through this cons ultancy also has application to other infectious disease such as CBPP. It is proposed that participatory epidemiology and disease modelling be used as a means of studying the dynamics of CBPP in endemic, pastoral settings and developing mo re practical control strategies. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 52. Participatory Disease Search in the East Nile Ecosystem Introduction, Objectives and Methods The immediate objective of the field mission wa s to investigate reports of the occurrence of rinderpest during November and December 2000 in the Kengen River area near Pibor. These reports described outbreaks of clinical disease consistent with the appearance of rinderpest in cattle and migr atory white-eared kob. Secondl y, the consultant provided training on participatory diseas e searching methods to proj ect and counterpart staff. In a more general context, the mission sought to collect information on the history of rinderpest circulation in the East Nile ecosystem through the process of participatory disease searching in order to inform the deve lopment of rinderpest eradication strategy. Several characteristic of the area are conducive to rinderpest endemism: Remoteness Marginalization Raiding Highly mobility Extensive, heterogeneous contact structure Numerous sub-populations with partial contact Absence of services The Kengen River runs south to north from Ka ssegnor to Pibor and is used by Murle, Jie and Toposa pastoralists (Figure 1). The Jie ha ve contact with Murle, Kachipo and Toposa groups. The Murle have contact with Jie, Bor Dinka and share borders with the Nuer and Anuak. The Toposa have contact with Jie and Mu rle to the North as we ll as a variety of peoples to the South, East and West. The Toposa are key to the containment of any residual RP in the East Nile ecosystem . The estimated cattle population for the communities east of the Nile are presented in Table 1. The primary approach used throughout the mission was participatory epidemiology and participatory disease searching based on PRA techniques (Mariner, 2001). The PE or PDS approach relies primarily on semi-s tructured interviews, mapping and other participatory information gathering exercise s to construct a best bet scenario on the dynamics of disease circulati on in an ecosystem. This appr oach allows the systematic identification of high-risk sub-populations and th e tracing of field repo rts to foci of active disease. Reports of current and historic disease events are collected from multiple informants and evaluated using the process of triangulation. The following ca tegories were used to the access the significance of individual reports: Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 6 1. A first hand report from a herder re garding morbidity/mortality due to rinderpest in his own herd. 2. A report of cases directly observed by a cattle owner. 3. Rural hearsay received from herders or elders in cattle camps who did not actually see the disease. 4. Town hearsay received from any source.

Reports that meet the criteria of categories 1 and 2 were used to directly construct the best bet epidemiologic scenari o. Information that falls within categories 3 and 4 was used as leads during the investigat ion, but was not treated as da ta in the final analysis. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 7Information was also collected on the age stru cture of cattle herds, herd size and the severity of rinderpest disease in orde r to assist with the estimate of R o, the basic reproductive number, for rinderpest. A propor tional piling exercise was developed to estimate the herd age structure and mort ality due to rinderpest by age group. Four categories were designated as sucklers, wean ers, heifers and steer s, and adult cattle. These categories were estimated to corresponded to less than 1 year-old, 1 to 2 years, 2 to 4 years, and older than 4 years. Respondent s were asked to divide 50 seeds between the four categories to indicate the relative size of the different categories in a normal herd. Respondents were then asked to illustrate th e relative mortality due to rinderpest (and other diseases) by removing seeds from each category. Where feasible, respondents were also asked to list the ages of all cattle in their herds. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 8 Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 9Boma On the arrival of the first mission to Boma, the team assessed the available intelligence regarding herder movements and the accessibi lity of the Kengen River. The information suggested that the road from Kassengor tr avelling North along the Kengen was mined. Further, reports suggested th at Murle cattle concentrations had moved away from the Kengen to locations to the North and Northwes t of Boma. The Jie we re concentrated due East of Boma at a swampy area called Kana muge by the Jie (Bodo by the Murle) just to the East of the Moruwo Hills near the Kengen River. It was also apparent that vaccination coverage was low in these populations (Tab le 2). In order to obtain first hand intelligence, the team decided to visit these concentration points.

Where NA is entered, the respondents were not asked to provide the information appropriate to the column. The Toposa at Namurpus did not identify rinderpest as a problem. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 10Comments suggested that the second most recent outbreaks mentioned where more memorable major outbreaks and that minor outbreaks occurred in many cases between the most recent and seco nd most recent reports. Murle (Nyalongoro and Garawurth) The team had the impression that the Murle appeared less open or willing to share information than the Jie. This combined with the limited number of interviews indicates that the information obtained s hould be interpre ted with caution. In the first three Murle interviews, res pondents clearly expressed that rinderpest ( bataboi ) had not been present in their cattle for at least 5 years. In the fourth interview, the respondent described rinderpest as a bienni al event that occu rred after every two calvings. By his watch, the community was just about due for the next outbreak. All Murle groups stressed that they were very concerned ab out rinderpest. They stated that if the disease has been absent five years or more, a reintroduction would be very severe. Approximately 66 sera were collected from Murle cattle at Nyalongoro and Garawurth. The majority were unvaccinated. Age data was collected to allow the calculation of the average age of seroconversion. One report of direct observation of white-ear ed kob dying with tear ing and diarrhoea was received, but no one reported having observe d sick cattle. The wildlife deaths were reported from Teltelle near Kengen. Teltelle wa s described as two days walk south of Pibor, three days walk north of Bodo and 2 days walk west of Lazach. Teltelle was mentioned in the report of Dr. Aluma Arab a as a place where the kob passed. Dr. Araba's report was based on information obtained from the SRRA vet officer, John Dodo and two vaccinators. Lazach was described as a major grazing centre for the Murle from all directions. It was reported to be accessible by vehicle either fr om Bodo or Nyat travelling cross-country. An old road exists from Boma that passes through Lazach, but it is mined. Had the first mission continued in Boma, Lazach would have been visited. A second mission to Boma was undertaken in April with the objective of reaching Lazach. Unfortunately heavy rains occurred just as the mission reached Boma a nd off road travel became impossible. After waiting three days for the rivers to go down, the mission was able to return to Loki, but required three days to cover 300 km. During the second mission, three interviews were conducted with groups that had recently come from Lazach. The first was with two respected elders that were also active in civil and political affairs (a former co mmissioner and a policeman). The second two interviews were with two men in their late 20's. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 11The elders who had returned from Lazach were bona fide cattle owners who spoke knowledgeably about disease and rinderpest. Th ey identified three important diseases (maam, made no statem ent on whether or not rinderpest was on going. When asked, they said that rinderpes t was occurring in unvaccinated herds in Lazach. They estimated that less than 25% of the cattle were vaccinated. They stated that the disease occurred every 1 to 2 years. Their description was consistent with the expected behaviour of rinderpest in an endemic population with poor vaccination coverage. Of the two young men interviewed one had or iginated from Thobor, 2 hours walk from Pibor, and had passed Duren on the Kengen River and then Lazach. The second young man was from Labarab village in Lazach a nd was a member of the Turain cattle camp (kuthur ). Both young men described maam and kapunech in detail. They stated that these were the main problems of the cattle in L azach and elsewhere. When asked, they could describe rinderpest well, but stated very clear ly that it was not occurring at the present time in Lazach. The young man (26 years-old) who resided in Lazach stated that he had never seen the disease. The man from Thobor st ated that he had last seen the disease in 1987-88. It is of interest to note that the more politically active elders gave internally consistent reports of rinderpest while less complicated livestock owners gave opposite information. The consultant is concerned that the orig inal reports from Pibor, which came from urbanized community leaders, may form a pa ttern of rumours to draw attention to a neglected area. The missions did not find significant direct evidence of active RP among the Murle. However, it is difficult to support a negative co nclusion in light of th e extensive indirect evidence of rinderpest. This included widely disseminated rinderpest rumours, detailed existing veterinary knowledge about rinderpest and the priority the communities placed on rinderpest. Ruling out rinde rpest requires more data directly from the cattle camps than has been collected among the Murle. Gi ven the remoteness of the terrain, a tractor and wagon would be the most appropriate means of accessing these communities in any season. The Murle community should be an objec tive of further investig ations in the next Jie (Khor Ardep, Lelimay and Kanamuge) and Toposa The Jie provided detailed descriptions of rinderpest outbreaks between late 1998 and January 2000. They used two terms for rinderpest, achoke and acheke. The term achoke appeared to be a loan word from the Toposa. Acheke was a term that referred to the standing of hair during the febrile phase. The Jie reported that the st anding of hair was the first sign of rinderpest. No first hand re ports of active rinderpest were received during the mission. The Jie had heard of disease outbr eaks in kob and were concerned that the disease would come with the return of the kob to the area in March. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 12Vaccination coverage was moderate in K hor Ardep and Lelimay, and occasional in Kanamuge. Kanamuge was a major dry season centre fo r the Jie. The mission estimated that 20,000 cattle were in the area at the time of the vi sit. The majority of families used the Lopet area as their wet season home and cultivation area. Some used the Moruwo Hills just next to Kanamuge and others used Longlebai Mountain extending to the south of Boma Mountain. It was reported that only cows in milk and calves normally travelled to these wet season areas. Special efforts were made to seek out the Taragabon Jie at Kanamuge (Bodo) as a report from Pibor (George Were) indicated that this clan was currently suffering from RP. The report said that the Taragabon had travelled to the Kurun River area. The Makadol Jie also mentioned that they had heard that the Taragabon had rinderpest when they were crossing the Lodet area of the Kengen. The mission was unable to locate any Taragabon who had been a Lodet and was told that only about five families had crossed that way from Lopet by the way of Lodet. The Taraga bon also pointed out Toposa groups in the Bodo area and stated that Tabazak was the Murle term for the Toposa people. They reported good relations with the Toposa in the area and no rum ours of rinderpest. Six sera were collected from a group of young Taragabon cattle reported to have been affected by RP in 1999. The Kurun River and Kurun delta (Nagelmakol ) are Toposaland areas to the south of Kassengor. This area was visit by Dr. Rafael Lo tira Arasio on foot in mid-January 2001. The Toposa did not report active rinderpest and stated that th ey did not remember the last outbreak. In fact, they indicated that vacci nation was no longer necessary. Dr. Lotira also travelled from Mogus in the direction of Lopet in early January 2001 interviewing Toposa in route. No reports of rinderpest were received. Jie were not encountered in either mission and it is believed to be problem atic for Jie to enter these areas. This information complemented the findings of the limited interviews conducted by the consultant around Kurun in route to Boma. The Jie consistently described a pattern of minor outbreaks with a two-year cycle. It was their opinion that RP was due to return in 2001. They indicated that the wet season was the traditional period of disease activity. The conclusion of the mission was that there was sufficient evidence that rinderpest had been circulating in the Jie herds up until Ja nuary 2000. The disease pattern and size of the community suggested that the Jie community were an impor tant sub-population of an endemic system. The community is probabl y not large enough to maintain RPV in isolation from other communities. The absence of disease over the past 12 months is entirely consistent with the cycl ic nature of rinderpest endemism. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 13Paluer: the Bor Dinka and the Murle Bor Dinka Rinderpest ACROSS has estimated that the Bor Dinka are currently keepi ng about 96,000 cattle based on information from CAHWs, local chie fs and veterinary personnel. Almost all cattle were lost in 1992 during a period severe inter-factiona l conflict . At the present time, the Dinka are actively restocking. Cattle are being purchased from Murle, Nuer, Mandari and Dinka sources. Traditional loan s and exchanges with other Dinka groups is also a major source of cattle. At the presen t time herd sizes are reported to be much smaller than in the past. Examples were en countered of herds with 10 to 30 cattle at present. Prior to 1992, an average cattle owne r was reported to have kept over 100 head. Rinderpest ( nyanatech ) was very well known and feared, but had not been seen in over a decade. As an example, elders at Akot cattle camp gave the most detailed description of rinderpest received since the beginning of the consultants mission to South Sudan. However, they had not experienced the dis ease in their cat tle since 1976. This matter was probed in detail. Table 4: Proportional Mortal ity at Akot Cattle Camp Age Class <1 year 1- 2 yrs 2-4 yrs >4 yrs Overall Herd Structure (% of Herd) 20 20 20 40 Severe RP Mortality (%) 100 100 30 15 54% Annual CBBP Mortality (%) 0 30 30 15 18% The Bor Dinka community has had limited contact with the Murle in recent years. In the past they used to share grazing in Penyko or Aying wilderness to the East of Bor. The name Penyko refers to whistling thorn that predominates in the wilderness. This wilderness was reported to run from the North to South and span the area from Waat to Lafon. The Murle were reported to be under th e influence of the GOS at Pibor and the raiding of cattle and children was re ported to be a major concern. The Penyko has functioned as a no-mans-land and probably as a natural and social barrier to rinderpest. Since August of 2000, Murle peace deputations have sought the Dinka. Reconciliation was advancing at the time of the mission and Mu rle cattle camps were reported to be at Gam in the Penyko . Gam was described as being 4 hour s walk from Anyidi and 3 days walk from Pibor. Abraham Alier Jocoyi, the Dinka CAHW Team Leader at Anyidi, had spent several days with the Murle. He was interviewed privately and reported that the Murle cattle were healthy wit hout any rumours of rinderpest. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 14The Dinka are very concerned that the Murle wi ll bring rinderpest. They state the reason for their concern is that the Murle cattle are unvaccinat ed. There are no rumours of rinderpest in the area. The white-eared kob ( juil) were reported to be healthy. Elders did state that the kob could suffer from rinderpest with symptoms of tearing and diarrhoea. They were clear that the kob were healt hy this year. The inve stigation team was concerned that extension messages may have already sensitised the community about the rumours of disease in kob. Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia The mission made inquiries in to the importance of CBPP ( abutpio ) in the area and the methods and efficacy of treatment. It seems that abutpio and luach (trypanosomosis) are the major current animal health problems. The ACROSS veterinarian expressed concern that the prevalence of CBPP seemed to be rising despite treatment. Proportional mortality ranking suggested that mortality was highest in the age groups between 1 and 4 years. Zessin et al. (1985) found that Dinka cattle in Bahr el Ghazal between 3 months and 3 years of age had a significantly higher risk of CBPP infection than other age groups. These same authors f ound a very low prevalence of clinical CBPP disease in all age groups. Herders and CAHWs were interviewed as to the dosages and number of treatments applied as well as the response to treatment. It was apparent that oxytetracyclines were being applied at the correct dosage rate and that a singl e treatment could result in remarkable clinical improvement. It was re ported, however, that new cases frequently continued to appear in the herd and that the original animals often fell sick within a few days to weeks of the first treatment. Res pondents believed that their herd mates were reinfecting the treated animals. However, th e time intervals suggested that recrudescence of clinical disease was more likely than reinfection. On the other hand, it was reported that treatment could clear the infection from a herd. Thus, the role of treatment from both an epidemiologic and economic perspective is unclear. Murle During the first two days of the mission, the te am was informed that it was not possible to have direct contact with the Murle for s ecurity reasons. On the third day, ACROSS suspended its activities briefly while discus sions were held with the SRRA regarding general security procedures. These were prom ptly resolved by a visit from county level authorities on the morning of the fourth da y (and last full day) of the mission. The SRRA authorized and requested that the mission make contact with th e Murle at the end of that same meeting. The team travelled to Anyidi were a Dinka chief known to the Murle was contacted and interviewed. The chief reported that he ha d last experienced RP in 1986 at Aramjam cattle camp. The chief expressed the opinion that RP was hiding with the Nuer and Murle Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 15since they do not vaccinate. He also expressed the view that wildlife brought the disease, but stated that he was unaware of any disease in the white-eared kob ( juil) this year. Unfortunately, time did not allow the team to continue to the Murle community at Gam, but three Murle visitors from Ga m were interviewed at Anyidi. The three Murle respondents were two young adu lts and an adolescent. They stated that their home was at Macabol and that they di d not cultivate. When asked about animal health, they spoke knowledgeably about a number of diseases but did not mention rinderpest ( bataboi ). When asked about rinderpest di rectly they described the disease roughly as bloody diarrhoea and reported that they had experienced this disease in 1987 as boys. When directly asked about rumours th ey stated that they had heard a rumour about current rinderpest at Y uot near Gumuruk. The intervie w suggested that RP has not been a major problem for the western Murle in the recent past. The rumour of rinderpest at Gumuruk was consistent with the rumours from Pibor town. Shortly after the team left Paluer, a peace m eeting was held between the Murle and local authorities. The ACROSS veterinarian, Micheal Otto, had the opportunity to meet with Jiji Ajak, the Murle Chief. The chief confirmed that the Macabol Murle had not experienced rinderpes t since the 1980s. As a result of the Murle's reconciliation with the Dinka, it is now po ssible for services to be delivered to the Murle co mmunity from Paluer. Previously, the Murle community was only accessible to the southern sector from Bo ma. This second point of entry to the Murle community is a major development. The team conducted three separate group inte rviews in the Anyidi area on the frontier between Dinka and Murleland, two with Dinka and one with Murle. All three interviews stated their last direct expe rience with rinderpest as 1986-87. Keichkon and the Sobat Basin As only two days were spent at Kiechkon, interviews could be conducted at four locations. These were mainly with Nuer in the area of Paidouch (N 8 52 19, E 33 06 33). However, recently displaced Dinka from the Malakal area were also encountered. As these Dinka were not accessible to service delivery in the past, considerable effort was made to interview them and sample their cattle. The rinderpest reports presented in Table 5 sh ow some evidence of temporal clustering (3 reports) in 1998 in the Nuer and Dinka cattle along the Sobat from Malakal to Uleng. Two first hand reports of the sighting of rinderpest in 2000 by CAHWs were also received. From 1989 to 1995, OLS was active in cattle vaccination from Nasir and along the Sobat. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 16Table 5: First Hand Rinderpest Reports received through NGOs and Most Recent Outbreak Reports Received at Interviews Location Community Date Source Baliet (Malakal) Oct, 2000 ADRA CAHW In general, it was noted that both Dinka and Nuer did not list rinderpest when asked to describe the problems or diseases in thei r cattle. With one exception, the respondents only mentioned nyapec after they were asked to describe the major disease of cattle from a historical perspective. This was very different from othe r groups interviewed at Bor and Boma. The amount detail of the descriptions of rinderpest varied. Some descriptions from elders and chiefs did not go beyond bloody diarrhoea, while ot hers included tearing and oral lesions. Finally, it was difficult for the respondents in the Kiechkon area, especially Nuer, to date outbreaks. In order to date out breaks, the respondents were asked to name major events that happened concurrently with the outbreak. The Nuer communities occupy the southern bank of the Sobat and extend as far south as Waat and southeast as Akobo. The Murle inhabit regions fu rther to the south. Due to cattle raiding and kidnapping of children, a la rge no-mans-land exists between the Nuer and Murle communities. It was concluded that the Sobat Basin should be treated as a separate system distinct from the Murle a nd Karamojong cluster peoples of Kengen River area. Although some slight clustering was evident in 1998 it would be premature to conclude that RP had been present (or has been absent ) in the area. What is needed is a more complete disease search focused on the Sobat Basin in its own right . This should include Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 17areas South of the River and would allow a more complete understanding of any linkages between the Sobat Basin and the Kengen River area. Nuer Two respondents at the village of Nuer pr ovided very detailed accounts of rinderpest outbreaks. They reported that the severity of outbreaks was variable and described a severe outbreak in 1989 and a mild outbreak in 1995. The results of a proportional piling exercise on herd structure and rinderpest mortality are presented in Table 6. Table 6: Rinderpest Mortality Described by the Nuer at Tuel Age Class <1 year 1- 2 yrs 2-4 yrs >4 yrs Overall Herd Structure (% Of Herd) 21.1% 15.8% 26.3% 36.8% Severe 58.3% 56.3% 62.0% 36.4% 25.0% 12.5% displa ced Dinka from Baliet. One interview was with two cattle owners at Tuel who reported that they had la st experienced rinderpest in 1998. The next morning the main Dinka cattle camp was visited and here the cattle camp leader ( beny wut ) reported that they had not expe rienced rinderpest since 1977. They reported that they had received limited vaccina tion from the northern sector operating out of Malakal. Very few animals were earmark ed. Sixty-six samples were collected from unmarked/unvaccinated cattle. The ages of the cattle sampled were recorded for the calculation of the average age of infection if evidence of exposure to rinderpest is encountered. Pochalla Pochalla is the main town of the Anuak, a primarily agricultural people who keep cattle. The town borders Ethiopia and the Anuak comm unity straddles the frontier. Cattle from the area are marketed in Ethiopia at Panadur. The white-eared kob were present in large numbers in the area at the time of the team's visit. The consultant was able to sample 5 kob killed by hunters along the road from Pochalla to Ajwara and Otal a. The communities reported that the kob were present in especially large numbers and that they were not experiencing dis ease. They did report Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 18that hunger was a problem and it was noted th at kob carcasses were lean. Hunting was very extensively practised and drying meat was observed at almost every homestead. It was stated by hunters that kob were difficult to bring down and that as many as two- thirds of the animals shot were not recovered. As a resu lt, decaying kob carcasses were plentiful throughout the bush. Because of raiding and child theft, the Anuak and Murle were not in contact. It was not possible to access Murle areas from Pochalla . The local community had received a peace delegation from the Murle, however they did not have confidence that the peace initiative was genuine. It was the team's conclusion th at the local cattle popul ation had almost no contact with other commun ities in southern Sudan. Anuak The Anuak did not have a term for rinderpest. As agriculturalists, the Anuak's existing veterinary knowledge was not very extensiv e. The Anuak at Otal a did recognise the Murle term bataboi but translated the term as diarr hoea. The team concluded that the Anuak were probably not familiar with rinderpest. In mapping exercises, the team inquired about the location of Jum. This was one of the sites identified by community l eaders at Pibor as an area wh ere the white-eared kob were dying of rinderpest. The Anua k indicated that Jum was a swampy area to the North of Otala. Formerly, Jum was an important graz ing area. However, due to insecurity, the Anuak mainly used Jum as a hunting area. The Anuak reported that the kob were not dying of disease. The mission investigated a chronic disease pr oblem in Otala that had caused significant mortality over a period of months. The Anua k had no name for the disease and actually gave very contradictory descri ptions of the clinical hist ory. Numerous carcasses were present at the outskirts of the village in va rious stages of decay. The primary clinical signs in the village herd were weight lo ss and anaemia. Lymph nodes were normal. The areas where the community was willing to gr aze the village herd were exhausted. The situation was not charact eristic of rinderpest. The World Relief veterinarian had previous ly conducted a post mortem examination on one severe case and observed liver flukes. Animals were grazed in swampy areas throughout much of the year. Blood smears from affected animals were submitted to the Save the Children laboratory at Lokichokio at that time and as part of the present mission. Theileria parva were promptly observed in both sets of blood smears. However, the absence of swollen lymph nodes suggested that ECF was not the primary problem. The World Vision veterinarian and the OLS t eam concurred that the mortality at Otala was probably multi-factorial w ith starvation, liver flukes and ECF all contributing. The veterinarian developed a re sponse plan consisting of in formation on management and treatment of the entire vi llage herd with flukicide. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 19The diagnostic challenge at Otala is representative of chronic h ealth situations in southern Sudan and demonstrates the value of the la boratory at Lokichokio. As the Anuak are primarily agriculturalists, the situation was further complicated by the their limited disease knowledge and a reluctance to take action on husbandry issues. Dinka There were two cattle camps ow ned by displaced Bor Dinka at Pochalla. They had come to Pochalla without cattle in the early 1990s by various routes. The Dinka were able to provide very precise descript ions of rinderpest. When directly asked one Dinka group indicated that they had experienced rinderp est in 1999 just prior to the training of CAHWs and vaccination at Pochalla. The second cattle camp clearly stated that they had not seen rinderpest since they left Bor in 1991. At the time of the CAHW training in 1999, Dr. Were did not note a ny reports of rinderpest. Overall Findings of the Rinderpest Investigations The mission covered 4 major locations and a total of 7 distinct communities in a period of 5 weeks. In April, a second mission was made to Boma. Af ter allowing for travel time and interruptions due to cancelle d flights, etc. this allowed on average 2 days of contact per community during the first mission. As a result only 4 to 8 interviews could be completed per community. With such a limited number of interviews, only very dramatic disease patterns would be detected with confidence. The Bor Dinka, Murle, Jie and Toposa commun ities were very knowledgeable in regard to rinderpest and without fail could provide a full and accurate description of the disease. All of the communities volunteered rinderpest when asked to describe the disease problems in their cattle. The Nuer and Dinka communities of the Soba t Basin were aware of rinderpest as a disease but with a few exceptions, they coul d not describe rinderpest with the same degree of confidence as the communities surrounding the Murle. The pattern of first hand reports indicated that the Jie had experienced rinderpest throughout 1999 up until January 2000. The Jie desc riptions of the pa tterns of infection, together with the one Murle report of 1998, were very consistent with endemic infection with a two-year inter-epidemic period. The absence of disease reports over the last 12 months is consistent with an inter-epidemic trough and may not represent the absence of disease. The consultant concluded that the Jie community is a component of an endemic system that may still be active. The reports from the Sobat Basin, although le ss convincing than the information obtained in Jie, are of concern. Access to the Soba t Basin has been poor in recent years and Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 20appears to be continuing to deteriorate. The consultant's visit to Pagak was cancelled due to security concerns and Kiechkon was evacuated one week after the team visited there. At the time of writing OLS has suspended NGO activities throughout most of the Sobat basin. This raises questions as to feasibility of rinderpest vaccination, surveillance or rapid response in the Sobat Basin. It also highlights the importance of taking advantage of windows of opportunity where they occur. Table 7: Herd Structure and Rinderpest Mortality Age Class N 1 year 1-2 yrs 2-4 yrs >4 yrs Overall Percent of Herd 15 17.2% 16.8% 23.8% 42.3% Percent RP 69.9% 67.0% 54.4% 47.6% 57.3% Percent 38.3% 33.4% 34.3% 26.1% 32.3% Major outbreaks were described as occurrence of the di sease after an inter-epidemic period of five or more years. Minor outbreaks were annual or bienni al events. Overall RP mo rtality was estimated as 57.3% for major outbreaks. Table 7 provides the overall data on the pr oportional piling exercises for herd age structure and rinderpest mortality. The exer cise proved to be hi ghly repeatable and provided data that matched the conventiona l wisdom regarding lineage 1 rinderpest. Although the consultant did not en counter active rinderpest, he is far from confident that rinderpest was absent from the East Nile Ecosystem. Traditionally, the cessation of vaccination has been regarded as a final test of the eradication of rinderpest. The decision suggests that there is a high level of confid ence that RP has been eradicated. One might say a confidence level of 90% or more. This level of confidence in the eradication of rinderpest does not exis t East of the Nile. Vaccination A separate concern is the impact of vaccina tion as it is now being practised in south Sudan on rinderpest. There is no doubt that vaccination has suppr essed rinderpest in southern Sudan. The absence of reports from areas West of the Nile combined with the relatively good access enjoyed by the veterinary programme on the Western side provide some confidence that rinderpest is no longer present west of the Nile. East of the Nile, it is doubtful that the curr ent levels of vaccination have been sufficient to interrupt the transmission of rinderpest in the ecosystem. An epidemiologic discussion Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 21of this point relative to transmission dynamics and the structure of th e cattle population in south Sudan will follow. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 223. Estimation of The Basic Reproduction Number R O The basic reproductive number is defined as the number of secondary cases that arise from one infectious index case in a totally susceptible population. It is a key concept in measuring the transmissibility of an infec tious agent in a population and has important consequences in regard to the dynamics of epidemics and endemism. The basic reproductive number al so has important consequences for control strategy, as it is the major determinant of the level of he rd immunity necessary to interrupt disease transmission and is a determinant of the critical community size (threshold size) necessary to maintain an agent in nature. In the case of rinderpest, R o is a function of: The transmissibility of virus strain and The contact structure of the population in question. In regard to transmissibility of a strain of rinderpest, the following characteristics of the virus have an impact: Amount of virus shedding Infectivity of the strain (minimum infectious dose or animal ID 50) Duration of shedding (d) Features of the population that have an impact are: Density Movement Heterogeneity o Herd size o Community size o Within herd and between herd interactions As a result, a general statement about R o for all strains of rinderpest in all animal husbandry systems cannot be made. The same st rain of virus may have a very different Ro in a pastoral setting as opposed to a cut and carry smallholder dairy system. Physical contact rates are usually high in the pastoral systems and may be essential zero in the dairy setting. Alternately the conventional wisdom on the transmissibility of lineage 1 RPV versus lineage 2 viruses suggests that the R o values for these strains are different. This thinking predicts a higher reproductive number for lin eage 1 RPV than for lineage 2 RPV in the same population. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 23This relationship has been stated mathematically as: R o = Number of physical contacts per day (c) Probability of transmission per contact (p) Days infective (d) Or: R o = cpd (equation 1) The two terms, c and p, are sometimes expressed as one term, , the effective contact rate. The effective contact rate can be defi ned as the number of contacts an infected animal has per day that result in transmi ssion in a totally susceptible population. In models using a term: Ro = d (equation 2) Methods for Estimating R O Proportion susceptible in endemic areas In endemic populations with low or no vaccination cover, the value of R o can be calculated from the proportion of the populat ion that is susceptible to infection (Anderson, 1992). If the proportion susceptible is termed x than: R o = 1/x (equation 3) For example, if the proportion susceptible is 0.29 (71% seropositive) than R o = 1/0.29 = 3.45 If the proportion susceptible is 0.226 as Maj ok et al. (1991) reporte d for the southern Sudan then: R o = 1/0.226 = 4.42 This method assumes random mixing and more or less continuous transmission. In situations where endemism is characterized by a cyclic wave of transmission (most situations) the proportion susceptible must be measured in a manner that averages the Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 24peaks and troughs. True random sampling throughout the population accomplishes this. Poor or moderate vaccination coverage should not distort this measure in the case of a disease with a high R o as wild virus circulation will continue until the proportion of susceptibles falls to the levels determined by R o. This has been demonstrated with field data on measles in England and Wales (Fine and Clarkson, 1982). Average age of infect ion in endemic areas The basic reproductive number can also be estimated from the average life expectancy (L) and the average age of infection (A) (Fine, 1 993). The relationship is: R o = L/A (equation 4) Average life expectancy can be estimated ra ther easily from demographic studies. For a disease with low mortality, average age of infection can be estimated from serologic studies were age data is colle cted. For a disease with signi ficant mortality, data on age- specific mortality rates are also needed. Incorporation of the average ag e of loss of maternal immun ity (M) gives a more precise estimate. R o = (L-M) / (A-M) (equation 5) In this method, pulses of vaccination have th e potential to significantly distort the calculation and would tend to lower the average age of infection. For a highly transmissible strain of lineage 1 RP virus, the effect of vaccination campaigns more than 3 years in the past would proba bly not affect the calculations significantly. The effect of intermittent vaccination would be more severe for calculations on lineage 2 viruses, if indeed they are less transmissible. Incidence proportion and proporti on susceptible after epidemics Incidence proportion (IP) is th e number of animals affected during a time period divided by the total number of anim als at risk. After an epidemic, the proportion dead or recovered divided by the number at risk is the incidence proportion for the period of the epidemic. The proportion of the population that is susceptible (x) after an epidemic is: x = 1 - I P ( e q u a t i o n 6 ) and the proportion susceptible after an epidemic is proportional to R o x < 1/R o (equation 7) Thus, if the number of suscep tible and total population, or th e proportion susceptible after an epidemic is known, R o can be estimated. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 25 In the case of classic rinderpest, if the de scriptions of greater than 90% mortality are accepted, then R o: (1-.9) < 1/R o 10 Ro However, at these high mort ality rates the value of R o is very sensitive to small changes in the mortality rate. If 95% mo rtality was experienced then R o was on the order of (1-.95) < 1/R o 20 Ro An estimate of R o in the range of 10 to 20 is cons istent with conventional wisdom on severe or classical rinderpest and corresponds to the information available on measles (Anderson, 1982). Estimates from case rates Where detailed outbreak data is available, and R o can be estimated from population data (N), the number of new cases (C), the number susceptible (S) and the number infectious (I). The following basic relationshi p for calculating the number of new cases is used: C = SI/N (equation 8) This method has been used in the develope d world where very accurate and extensive investigations are undertaken as part of emergency responses to exotic disease introductions (Stegeman et al., 1999) and l ongitudinal studies (van Roermund et al., 1998). Unfortunately, this method is not very appropriate for the analysis of rinderpest epidemiology in the developing world due to the vast amounts of very detailed monitoring data required. Estimates from laboratory transmission experiments Methods are now available for determining R o in controlled transmission experiments. This approach has been used to evaluate vaccine efficacy and offers considerable advantage over more traditional methods of vaccine evaluation (de Jong, 1995; de Jong and Kimman, 1994). It should be born in mind that R o is a feature of an agent in the context of a population. R o is determined by the combined effect of the contact structure of th e population (c) and the Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 26probability that a contact results in transmi ssion (p) and the duration of infectivity (d). The last two parameters are, in part, featur es of the strain of agent involved whereas contact is a feature of the population and th e husbandry system. Thus, a measurement of Ro in a laboratory setting, although of vi rologic interest, may not have direct epidemiologic relevance to di sease control strategies in the African pastoral setting. Expert opinion: Values of R o implicit in the rinderpest modelling literature For the most part the rinderpest modelling lite rature has not stated explicit values for R o and has assumed values for transmission parame ters related to contac t. In general, the assumptions regarding effective contact were based upon expert opinion on transmissibility and the characteristic beha viour of rinderpest epidemics. However, the values of R o implicit to the models can be calculated from the information provided. Rossiter and James (1989) The most detailed and complete model of rinderpest transmission is based on a state transition approach and uses Monte Carlo me thods to introduce stochastic effects where small numbers of transitions occur (James and Rossiter, 1989; Ross iter and James, 1989). There is a considerable body of literature desc ribing the clinical cour se and excretion of rinderpest virus for various strains representi ng different pathotypes of the virus (mild to severe). Rossiter and James (1989) relied on this data to make fixed-point estimates for most parameter values in the model. Rossiter and James (1989) made use of an effective contact rate parameter, C r, that is equivalent to or cp. They noted 'There are no data which can be used to estimate the value of C r' and 'Changes in the C r, produced greater degrees of change in epidemic curves than any other parameter, indicating th at the model is especially sensitive to it and that may be the most important single factor in determining the spread of virus.' Through experimentation with the model, contact rates were determined that allowed the model to perform in a manner consistent wi th field observations of outbreaks and the basic assumptions of the model. Using equa tion 2, the contact rate and virus excretion period parameters provided allow the calculation of the values of R o implicit to the model. Table 8 Values of R o Used in the Rossiter and James (1989) Model Pathotype (virulence) High Moderate Low Mild Virus Excretion Period (days) 6 5 4 3 Contact rate 2.0 1.0 0.5 0.25 Basic Reproductive Number 12 5 2 0.75 Note that R o values in the range of 2 to12 are cons istent with theory and the conventional wisdom regarding the behaviour of th e various types of outbreaks. An R o value of less Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 27than one, as suggested in this paper for mild st rains, is not consistent with the spread of virus, and in theory an infectious agent with a R o of less than one would not be able to survive in nature. Tille et al. (1991) Tille et al. (1991) described both a deterministi c and stochastic approach to discrete-time modelling of infection caused by mild to severe strains of rinderpest. Rather than fixed parameter values for incubation and infecti ous periods, these authors used ranges for parameter values to mimic biologic variabil ity. The model input parameter values are shown in Table 9. Table 9: Model Parameters and R o Values Used in the Tille et al. (1991) Model Virulence High Moderate Low Latent Period (Max, Min (days)) 3,8 5,10 6,12 Infectious Period (Max, Min (days)) 4,6 5,7 6,8 RP Mortality Rate (%) 90 50 10 Physical Contact Rate 20 20 20 Probability of Infection per contact 0.04 0.02 0.01 Ro (Max, Min) 3.2, 4.8 2.0, 2.8 1.2,1.6 The basic reproductive number was calcu lated using equation 1 by multiplying the physical contact rate (c) times the probabil ity of infection per contact (p) and the maximum and minimum values for the infectio us period (d). Cumulative infection of the population reached 100% in model runs based on virulent parameters in both the deterministic and stochastic models. Nine ty-five percent cumulative infection was achieved with moderate strains. To the consultant's knowledge, field outbreaks of virulent RP have never been shown to in fect 100% of the populat ion. Ninety to 95% would appear to be the pract ical maximum for the most virulent outbreaks on record. This suggests the model is not fully valid. From their deterministic model, the author s derive expressions for the minimum herd immunity rate required to prohibit establishment of persistence. These equations correspond to the classic expression 1/R o = x or the proportion susceptible. The herd immunity threshold for the median of the ra nge of the infectious periods is presented below in Table 10. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 28Table 10: Herd Immunity Threshold for the Interruption of Transmission as Determined by Tille et al. (1991) Virulence High Moderate Low Median R o 4 2.4 1.4 Herd Immunity Threshold (R=1) (%) 75 58.3 28.6 This model finds that persistence of less viru lent and therefore less transmissible strains (lower R o values) can be prohibited by relatively lower herd immunity rates. This agrees with textbook formulations such as those presented by Halloran ( 1998), Anderson (1992) and Ferguson et al. (1999). This suggests th at lower herd immunity levels can interrupt the transmission of mild rinderpest strains than required for more virulent strains. Dobson (1995) Dobson (1995) has published on the modelling of dynamics of rinderpest in the cattle and wildlife populations of the Serengeti ecosystem. Unfortunately, the assumptions on transmission implicit to the model are not clear ly stated and units are not specified were values are given. Estimates of R o for Rinderpest in Southern Sudan Livestock Populations Given the available data, three methods can be used for estimation of R o in southern Sudan. These are: Proportion of the population susceptible Average age of infection in endemic populations Expert opinion In endemic populations where only modest le vels of vaccination has taken place, the percent susceptible is still a function of the transmissibility of wild virus. Wild virus circulation will continue despite vaccination un til the percent susceptible falls to a level consistent with R o (Anderson, 1992). The data of Majok et al (1991) provide the most extensive and reliable estimate of the pr oportion susceptible. They estimated that vaccination coverage was only 15%, which could not account for the high levels of herd immunity found in their survey. Operation Lifeline Sudan mainly collected sera from vaccinated populations. Estimation of vaccination cover is very difficult as the overall population estimates are very imprecise. Vaccination and serum collection tended to be foca lised. As a result only two groups of sera were identif ied that seemed appropriate for the estimation of R o. These groups were unvaccinated cattle collected by OLS in Ayod in 1991 and Naita in 1997. A third group of sera collected in 1999 from Mu rle cattle at Kavula have yet to be tested.

(1991) also found a mean ag e of 5.68 yrs and provided age stratified serological data for Bahr el Ghazal Provi nce. This data is present in Table 12. Table 12: Age Stratified Prevalence of RP Antibody as Reported by Majok et al. (1991). Age (yrs) 68.17 5-7 87.25 8-10 85.99 Using equation 7 and estimating M as 3 mont hs, A as 18 months and L as 5.68 yrs, on can calculate R o: R o = (L-M) / (A-M) = ((5.68 yrs * 12 m - 3 m) / (18 m - 3 m) = 4.34 This is in very close agreem ent with the estimate derived from the proportion susceptible in Bahr el Ghazal as described in Table 11. Based on the results of the proportional piling exercises (Table 7), rinderpest outbreaks in southern Sudan could best be described as m oderately virulent. If one examines previous rinderpest models as a source of expe rt opinion, Rossiter and James (1989) found parameters equivalent to a R o value of 5 resulted in simulations that best fit for rinderpest dynamics for moderately virulent viruses. Tille et al. (1991) on the other hand chose values in the range 2.0 to 2.8 for moderately virulent virus. The consultant recommends that a relatively conservative approach be utilized. Agents with higher R o values require higher levels of herd immunity to interrupt transmission. For the purposes of subsequent analysis, the value of R o for southern Sudan will be estimated to lie in the range of 3.5 to 5.3 with the most likely value being 4.4. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 304. Determining the Role of Vaccination and Herd Immunity in southern Sudan The Basic Reproductive Number a nd Herd Immunity in Southern Sudan Once the value of R o has been estimated, the level of herd immunity required to interrupt transmission (h) can be estimated by the relationship shown below. h = 1 - 1/R o (equation 9) This relationship for a range of values of R o is illustrated in Figure 2. Note that for values of R o greater than 10, more than 90% of th e cattle must be immune to interrupt transmission. This simple deterministic model assumes homogeneous mixing and does not allow for chance effects. In real life, disease can be e xpected to 'fade out' at lower herd immunity levels due to chance effect s where infected animals do not have contact with susceptibles. Further, heterogeneous contact structures ca n also contribute to lowering the global herd immunity rate required to interrupt transmission.

Note that a value of R o between 4 and 5 requires a herd immunity of 75 to 80% to interrupt transmission. Cl assic virulent rinderpest and measles viruses require herd immunity rates of over 90%. This analytical model does not incorporate chance effects and as sumes homogeneous mixing. As will be explained later, eradication is possible in heterogeneous populations at much lower global immunity rates.

Vaccination efficiency is defined as that proportion of vaccinations that actually generate protective immunity unde r field conditions. Note that for R o in the range of 4 to 5 and 90% vaccination efficiency, the deterministic model predicts that 83 to 89% vaccination covera ge is required to interrupt transmission. This suggests that one round of vaccination in an extremely well execute d campaign could interrupt transmission in a defined homogeneous population. At lower vacci nation efficiencies, mo re than one round of vaccination coverage is required to achieve the required herd immunity thresholds given the transmission dynamics of ri nderpest in southern Sudan. Table 13 presents the levels of populati on herd immunity required to interrupt transmission for the values of R o estimated for southern Suda n in the previous section. Table 13: Herd Immunity and R o in southern Sudan Ro Herd Immunity Min R o 3.5 71.4 Peak R o 4.4 77.3 Max R o 5.3 81.1 Not all vaccinations work. In large campai gns, 80 to 90% vaccination efficiency is usually a practical goal. If the proportion of vaccinations that actually immunize the recipient (f) is added to equation 9, one can calculate the requir ed proportion of the population that must be immunized to in terrupt transmission as function of R o. Once again, the model is deterministic and assume s homogeneous mixing. Fade outs will occur at lower vaccination levels. v = (1- 1/R o) / f (equation 10) In terms of infectious dis ease epidemiology, a population can be defined as a group that shares contact. One can talk about the populatio n of cattle in southern Sudan and consider Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 32communities as inter-linked sub-populations within the global population of southern Sudan. In this light, the cattl e population of southern Sudan is a heterogeneous population with a complex contact structure. The impor tance of this conceptual model will be developed in the next section. Vaccination Coverage, Herd Immunity and Heterogeneous Populations in Southern Sudan Due to the fact that access to many locations within southern Sudan is restricted by security concerns, OLS Livestock Programme ac tivities are concentrat ed in a subset of communities and locations. As a result, it has never been possible to implement blanket vaccination. It has not and probably will not be possible to conduct randomised sampling to estimate herd immunity or to conduct serology-based disease surveillance based on Cannon and Roe's sampling designs (Anonymous 1982) as required by the OIE Pathway (Office International des Epizooties, 1998). It has been possible to carry out purposive sampling to answer specific epidemiologic que stions regarding viru s circulation or the local effectiveness of vaccina tion for defined sub-populations. The structure of populations varies between pa storal ethnic groups in southern Sudan. In order to assess the impact of vaccination so me simplifying generalizations can be made. The units of structure are the individually owned herd, the cattle or grazing camp, clan and tribe. This gives at least four levels of structure. Although cattle are moving between groups through exchange, dowry, loan and raid ing, the four levels of structure loosely define the structure of contact. The community-based approach of OLS targ ets specific identifiable community groups and works through the social structure to deliv er services. As a result, vaccination is focused in particular sub-groups of the popul ation. For the most part, the OLS Livestock Programme works at the level of cattle camps and clans. Given the size and extent of tribal communities in the south, it is rare for one NGO to cover an entire tribe, although it has occurred in some of the smaller communities. Globally, the number of vaccinations achieved is provided in Table 14. Cattle population estimates vary considerable. As estimat ed by the OLS Livestock Programme, the population of cattle accessible from the southe rn sector is 5,849,150 head of cattle. This figure has been used to calcula te the global coverage rates. Table 14: Global RP Vaccination Coverage in Southern Sudan Year Vaccination Percent Global Coverage 1999 541,578 9.3% 2000 473,582 8.1% Source: Bryony Jones, Review of Rinderpest Control Activities and Impact in Southern Sudan Since the Start of the OLS Livestock Programme (1989-2000), 2001 Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 33However, analysis at the global level that treats southern Suda n as one homogeneous population is misleading. Vaccination covera ge in southern Sudan is not dispersed homogeneously throughout the entire populatio n. It is highly focused in accessible communities. Seromonitoring has shown that these communities generally have herd immunity rates of 70 to 80%. As summarized in Table 15, eight years of seromonitoring found an average herd immunity rate of 73.2% East of the Nile and 70.3% West of the Nile in the populations served by the OLS community-based animal health programme. Table 15: Summary of OLS Seromonitoring Results: 1991 to 1999 Sample Size Number Vaccinated Prevalence of Antibody Vaccinates Prevalence of Antibody Non-Vaccinates Prevalence of Antibody Overall East of Nile 1172 579 80.5 60.8 73.2 West of Contro l Activities and Impact in Southern Sudan Since the Start of the OLS Livestock Programme (1989-2000), 2001 With only two exceptions, the data presented in Table 15 is from serum samples collected from vaccinated populations. Animals listed as unvaccinated are from vaccinated areas and are either un-marked or reported as unvaccinated by the owner. Conventional wisdom holds that many of these animals are in fact vaccinated. The results show that the prevalence of antibody is higher among vaccina tes (80.5% East of the Nile and 77.9% West of the Nile) than among non-vaccinates (60.8% East of the Nile and 51.6% West of the Nile). Sub-optimal vaccina tion does not normally raise he rd immunity levels above the level determined by R o in endemic populations (Fine and Clarkson, 1982). The fact that antibody levels among vaccinated anim als are higher than non-vaccinates suggests that the high levels are indicat ive of effective vaccination ra ther than disease circulation. Where vaccination is being pr acticed in southern Sudan, it is being applied correctly and at levels that are sufficient to interrupt transmission in the immediate communities served. The seromonitoring results indicate the OLS cattle program has been effective in removing specific sub-populations from the pool of susceptible sub-populations that contribute to the maintenance of rinderpest in southern Suda n. Whether they are the right populations or enough populations to erad icate the disease is not clear. \"In an effort to describe just the most superficial level of such complexity, Anderson and May formulated a set of ge neral equations describing populations broken into several groups with two different within and between group (high and low) transmission characteristics. They found that eradication could be achieved with fewer overall vaccinations if they we re distributed primarily to high contact Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 34rate groups ... than if they were distribut ed uniformly to th e overall population. Beyond this intuitively sens ible qualitative result, that it may be advantageous to target interventions at high risk groups we are left with th e conclusion ... social structure can have a profound effects on the likelihood and patterns of infection transmission and, hence, upon herd immunity thresholds.\" Fine, 1993, pg. 282 Herd Immunity and Population Age Structure The understanding that older animals are immune to rinderpest is a part of the existing veterinary knowledge of many communities in southern Sudan. This is attributed to previous exposure to disease or vaccine. The serologic survey conducted by Majok (1991) and basic epidemiologic concepts rega rding endemic disease clearly support this concept. The results of the proportional pi ling exercises on mortality by age group are a very good illustration of this traditional knowledge. Work with measles modelling has shown that adequate consideration of the age structure of herd immunity is important to predicti ng the impact of vaccination and the likelihood of disease fade outs in communitie s (Anderson and May, 1984). Although the construction of an age-structured model is beyond the scope of the present consultancy, the approach is important to understanding the impact of rinderpest vaccination in endemic communities. The fact that most vaccination in sout hern Sudan is concentrated on young stock increases the impact of the limited number of vaccinations performed. When vaccination is spread out over all age groups in populations already exposed to antigenic stimuli, the major part of vaccinations have no impact on the overall herd immunity because the recipients were already immune. A life expectancy of 5.68 years is equivalent to a herd replacement rate of 17.6% per year if the population is to remain stable. T hus, at the global level the OLS Livestock Programme is only vaccinating at about half the rate of birth of susceptible animals into the population. However when the impact of vaccination focused on young stock and specific communities are considered together, it suggests a very efficient strategy for the interruption of vi rus circulation. Quantitative Modelling Model building Modelling can be used as a tool assist in disease control strate gy formulation and to assess the impact of interventions. For exampl e, disease modelling has been used to: Identify optimal vaccination strategies for the interruption of transmission, Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 35 Demonstrate the impact of sub-optim al vaccination strategies on disease transmission, Identify conditions that contribute to endemism, Estimate the critical community si ze required to sustain endemism, Prioritise data collection efforts to better understand di sease dynamics With an estimate of the basic reproduction num ber from the field data and expert opinion as well as estimates of other model parameters such as the latent period and infectious period from the laboratory experiments, modelling can provide insight into the dynamics of rinderpest in southern Sudan. During the course of the consultancy three stochastic, discrete- time SEIR rinderpest models were constructed in @Risk. The math ematical formulations are presented in Annex 3. This is the first rinderpest model to incorpor ate actual estimates of R o from serological data. The models differ from previ ous RP models in that they incorporated probability distributions for key input parameters rather than fixed values and they used the mass action formulations of the stocha stic SIR model as developed by de Jong (1995). These probability distributions re flect both biological variation and the uncertainty in parameter estimates. A stochastic element was used for fractional transitions between the SEIR states rather than rounding to a whole number. Where prob ability calculations pr edicted less than one transition per time step the model was fully stochastic. Outputs are presented as probability distributions. The outputs include R o, the duration of the epidemic, the total number of cases and the nu mber susceptible remaining. The first model was a closed population mode l where the basic rela tionship between the course of an epidemic in relation to the input parameters. In the closed model, birth and mortality parameters are not incorporated and the population has a fixed size. The R state represents recovered animals and no anim als are removed (die) from the population. Parameter inputs include: Alpha: rate of recovery/removal (=1/infectious period) Gamma: transition rate from exposed to infectious state (=1/latent period) C Number of physical contacts per day p Probability that one cont act results in transmission T Time step The following initial values are entered: E Initial number exposed I Initial number infectious N Initial population size R Number removed/recovered (or vaccinated) Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 36The second model was an open population mode l where new susceptibles are born at each time step. Open population models allo w experimentation with both epidemic and endemic patterns of disease transmissi on. The model added the following input parameters: b Birth rate \u00b5 Mu: non-specific mortality rate Sigma: rinderpest specific mortality rate In this model, the R state represents recovere d animals. A fifth state of removed (or dead) animals is implicit to the model. The mass actio n term incorporates th e population size at each time step as the sum of the four states (S+E+I+R) rather than a fixed value of N. The third model introduced a heterogeneous pop ulation structure by replicating the open population model to simulate a series of interlinked sub-pop ulations, each analogous to a pastoral community. The model incorporated a sub-population contact matrix where the physical contact parameter, C, could be ente red to vary the degree of contact between populations. The structured populat ion SEIR model runs slowly and work remains to be completed to streamline its operation. Experi mentation with this model was not begun. Potential future work includes: Increase the stochastic element by rais ing the cut off level for stochastic determination of state transiti on from susceptible to exposed. Systematic experimentation with the open population model Development of the structured population model Development of an age-structured model Application of the model to CBPP The next section details some preliminary e xperimentation with the model. Systematic experimentation will be completed in the future. During the course of the mission, the model was used to demonstrate basic concepts of rinderpest epidemiology. Preliminary insights from the models The following discussion develops a selection of concepts explored in the models. It is important to note that the models are s till under development. The relative effects illustrated by the models are valid, howeve r the reader is cautioned not to draw conclusions about estimates or the absolute values required to generate certain scenarios. As an example, the open population model easily generates endemic scenarios with relatively modest population sizes. By increasing the stochastic element in the model, the chance of fade-outs is greatly increased. Th is would raise the critical community size (CCS) for the maintenance of rinderpest.

Initial conditions included 130,000 recovered and 50 expose d. The source of the in itial 130,000 recovered could be from previous disease exposure of vacci nation. This curve is consistent with endemic rinderpest with or without sub-opti mal vaccination at the outset and no vaccination thereafter. Note the inter-epidemic period of approximately 600 days. Beyond expert opinion, there is no data ava ilable at this time upon which to base a decision regarding the appropria te level of stochasticity in the model. In the case of measles, model design greatly influences esti mates of critical community size for viral persistence. These estimates range between 100,000 and 500,000 individuals. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 38Incorporating age-structure and heterogeneity in the c ontact structure influences estimates of CCS (Earn et al., 1998; Keeli ng, 1997; Keeling and Grenfell, 1997; Rohani et al., 1999). The R o input distribution used in preliminary experimentati on is presented in Figure 4. Figures 5 presents an example of an ende mic scenario in a population of 200,000 animals over 5 years. Note that the initial conditi ons included 50 exposed animals. Due to the high number of exposed animals present at the outset, the virus almo st always persists. Figure 6 is the distribution of the lengths of outbreaks one would expect if a single infected animal were introduced into the same population modelled in Figure 5. Modelling literature distinguishes between minor and major outbreaks. Minor outbreaks are an introduction where the infection fails to take hold and rapi dly dies out without causing a classic epidemic. Major outbreaks ar e those introductions that lead to an epidemic that infects the majority of the population. As seen in Figure 6, when a single infectious animal is introduced into a 65% immune population, 87% of outbreaks are minor, and 7% are major. In 6% of the itera tions the disease persists with fade-outs occurring in one third of these cases. Figure 6: Distribution for Lengths of Epidemics 00.20.40.60.81 080160 240 320 400 480 560 640 720 Length of Outbreak (Days)PROBABILITY Figure 6: The distribu tion of 100 outcomes for the length of the epidemic after the introduction of a single exposed animal into a population that is otherwise identical to the example in the previous figure (65% immune). Note that in 87% of iterations a minor outbreak occurs. In 7% of the iterations a major outbreak lasting 40 to 160 days occurs. In 2% of the iterations the disease fades out between 680 and 720 days. In 4% of the iterations the disease is endemic at the end of two years. Figures 5 and 6 suggest that a moderate level of herd immunity (65% in this example) may not be sufficient to eradicate endemic in fection, but it sufficien t in most cases to prevent introductions to a population. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 39 The relationship between the number of imm une animals present in a population of 200,000 and the length of an outbreak resul ting from the introduction of 5 exposed animals is graphed in Figure 7. One could conc eive of this experime nt as the introduction of one or a few exposed herds into a larg e pastoral community with extensive mixing. Figure 7: Persistence as a Function of Herd Immunity 010 0200300400500600700800 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 80000 200000 Initial Number Recovered (Immune)Length of Outbreak (Days) Figure 7: In this simulation the model was run over two years after the introduction of 5 exposed animals. The initial number of recovered (immune) animals present varied between 0 and 200,000 by sampling a uniform distributi on for the initial number recovered. The length of the outbreak is plotted against the number initially immune. Note that at low levels of herd immunity outbreaks last about 150 days. As the herd immunity rises to about 50% (100,000 immune animals out of 200,000) the length of the outbreak increase s to the range of 300 to 500 days. Between about 55 and 70% herd immunity, the introduction of 5 exposed animals resulted in persis tent infection that was still on going at the end of 730 days. When herd immunity surpassed 80% (160,000 immune out of 200,000) only minor outbreaks occurred. When herd immunity is: Less than 30%, an epidemic results that is over in about 150 days. The disease does not persist in this homogeneous population. Between 30 and 50%, the result is still an epidemic, but it is extended over a longer period. The epidemic curve is wider and flattened relative to an epidemic in a more susceptible population. Between 55 and 70%, the disease persis ts throughout the time period modelled. The virus becomes endemic. Greater than 80%, only minor outbreaks occur and the population is protected Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 40Once again, it would not be advisable to draw specific quantitative conclusions from these preliminary experiments. However, the trends and co ncepts are valid. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 415. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy for the East and West Nile Ecosystems Throughout most of the life of the OLS Live stock Programme, international authorities have taken view that rinderpe st eradication was not possibl e in southern Sudan without peace. It was not until 1998, that the intern ational community developed an appreciation of the extent of the impact of the OLS Li vestock Programme on ri nderpest in southern Sudan and the true potential of community-b ased vaccination using heat-stable vaccine. As a result, eradication has not been a stat ed objective of the programme until relatively recently. Formulation and implementation of a comprehensive eradication strategy only began about two years ago. It is a generally accepted principle in dis ease eradication that vaccination efforts should be focused on high-risk communities wh ere transmission parameters (e.g. R o) are highest (Anderson and May, 1984; May and Anderson, 1984; Fine, 1993). This approach has the greatest impact on disease tr ansmission by removing the key populations that contribute the most to the maintenance and dissemination of infection. The Pan African Rinderpest Campaign successfu lly applied this principle in Ethiopia where lowland pastoral groups were identified as the communities with the greatest potential for disease maintenance. Sedentar y communities contributed much less to the maintenance of the disease as animal contact rates were very much lower. This resulted in a lower value of R o. When blanket vaccination was discarded and vaccination was targeted to high-risk communities, rinderpest was eradicated from the country in three to four years with global vaccination covera ge not exceeding 10 to 15% of the national population. The coverage was, however, concentr ated in high-risk communities. It was a very successful and efficient strategy. It has already been stated that the animal population in southern S udan is structured and that vaccination coverage is focused. Howeve r, the dichotomy of pastoral and sedentary production systems is not present. Although the degree of mobility varies between communities, all major animal populations of southern Sudan are transhumant. Thus, it is not expected that R o would vary drastically between major sub-populations. It would be more appropriate to view southern Sudan as a series of interlinked sub- populations with similar 'within-population' tran smission parameters (R o). These sub- populations would be related by 'between -population' transmission parameters determined by the amount of shared grazing and watering locations, stock transfers and raiding. These relationships often vary year to year as communities make and break peace agreements. In this context, it is more diffi cult to identify specific high-risk communities that warrant priority in vaccination program mes. In fact, rinderpest may circulate between communities in a somewhat stochastic (chance) manner. Removing communities from the pool of susceptible communities through focused vaccination decreases the chance that rinderpest wi ll survive in a region. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 42One can hypothesize that the following characte ristics are criteria for prioritising the major pastoral communities in terms of th eir potential contribution to the risk of endemism: Community size Number of communities in contact Quality or degree of each intercommunity contact Internal mobility For example, the Toposa and Murle are highly mobile and large communities. They are estimated to have approximately 300,000 a nd 800,000 cattle respectively. This is above any estimates of critical community size for ri nderpest or related disease agents. Due to their size, these groups border a number of ot her communities, but they have had limited peaceful contact with most of their nei ghbours since the mid 1980s. The Murle probably could maintain rinderpest on their own, perhaps with only rare spill ove r of virus to other communities. It is also possible to conceive of the Murle clans as an interlinked system of sub-populations in their own right. On the other hand, the Jie are a small co mmunity with only about 40,000 cattle. This number is probably less than the critical co mmunity size for rinderpest indicating that the Jie could not maintain rinderpe st alone. Rinderpest in Jie is best understood as periodic spill over from other communities or part of a larger endemic system of sequential flow of infection through a series of communities. The most immediate links to the Jie are the Toposa and Murle. In a sense, the Jie may be functioning as an i ndicator population for disease endemism in one or more of these larger communities. If the mechanism of endemism in the southe rn Sudan is the continuous flow of virus between interlinked sub-populations, vacci nation of a sufficient number of key communities in the chain of transmission should be enough to break the chain. In this regard, the focal nature of the OLS v accination has been highly appropriate. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 43 Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 44 Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 45Cessation of Vaccination The final test in the eradication process is the cessation of vaccination. When surveillance indicators provide a reasonable level of confidence that the disease has not occurred for two years (Office Internationa l des Epizooties, 1998) and th e capacity to respond rapidly to any flare-ups of occult rinderpest is in place, vaccination should cease. A period of intensive surveillance should follow. If one vi ews the likelihood of rinderpest eradication as a probability, vaccination should cease wh en decision makers are 90 to 95% confident that the disease is eradicat ed. In situations where the capacity for rapid response is reduced, decision makers should requir e a greater degree of confidence. In the case of southern Sudan, where access comes in the form of windows of opportunity, it is easy to imagine outbreak scen arios where rapid res ponse is not feasible despite the best of preparations. This s uggests that decision makers should require detailed surveillance data or a higher le vel of confidence resulting from a prolonged period of disease absence before ceasing vaccination. On the other hand, the R o estimates and modelling exercises clearly indicate that vaccination should not be practised where it can not be applied properly. This means that vaccination should not be undertaken unless there is a reasonable expectation of achieving 80% herd immunity in a define d subpopulation. Rather than create the conditions conducive to the maintenance of occult endemism, it would be more appropriate to cease (or never start) vaccina tion in such areas and conduct surveillance. West of the Nile, it has been more than fi ve years since the last confirmed rinderpest outbreak. Participatory methods al so indicate that livestock owners have not experienced rinderpest in over five years. The CAHW networks are well established and access is generally good. The potential for rapid respons e exists. Cessation of vaccination is the prudent and appropr iate next step. East of the Nile, the situation is much more complex. It is helpful to consider the East Nile Ecosystem as two sub-systems. The north ern sub-system is esse ntially the Nuer and Dinka communities of the Sobat Basin (Figur e 8). Both banks of the river should be included in this system as the communities cross the river freely. The logical northern boundary for the Sobat Basin subsystem is the extent of the Nuer and Dinka communities. Although contact ex ists with the highly transhumant Fellata and Beggara communities to the North, they have distinctly different contact, density and movement patterns. The Southeast subsystem is centred on the Kengen River and begins North of Pibor at the boundary between the Nuer and Murle co mmunities. There is a large no-mans-land between the Nuer and Murle, and cattle raidi ng appears to be the main contact between these two groups. The Southeast Nile ecosyst em should be considered to include the Toposa community to the South and the commun ities in the Torit ar ea. The Nile is the boundary to the West with the Bor Di nka included in the sub-system. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 46The situation in Sobat Basin (the northern Ea st Nile Ecosystem) is less clear. First hand evidence of disease circulati on was received during the missi on that described outbreaks in 1998 and 2000. However, the sample size was small as only two days were spent in the field at Kiechkon. The OLS disease repo rting system received passive reports throughout this same period, but all of thes e that could be investigated by the OLS network were concluded not to be rinderpest. Most importantly, the window of opportunity to conduct work in the Sobat Basi n is decreasing. It is difficult to imagine effective vaccination or survei llance taking place in this re gion in the near future. In the Southeast Nile Ecosystem, the last confirmed rinderpest occurred in 1998 in the Lopit Hills. However, particip atory disease searchi ng revealed a clear pattern of disease circulation in the Jie community in Jongl ei throughout 1999 into early 2000. Given the constraints to disease surveillance in southern Sudan, this should be accepted as evidence that two years have not elap sed since the last occurrence of rinderpest. The window of opportunity to conduct work in the Kengen and Kurun River is expanding. Good access is available to the Toposa, Jie and large s ections of the Murle community from Boma and Paluer. These opportuniti es should be utilized. Rinderpest Eradication in the East Nile Ecosystem Zonation and vaccination Combining pragmatic, sociologic and epidemio logic considerations it is recommended that the rinderpest eradicati on strategy East of the Nile develop a time-bound strategy that targets vaccination and surveilla nce at the community level. The first step is to inventory and assess communities according to risk factors and accessibility. It is proposed that three categor ies of communities are defined as follows: Surveillance and vaccination communities : accessible communities at risk for rinderpest where effective vaccination is feasible. Surveillance communities : partially accessible communities that are at risk for rinderpest but where effective vaccination is not feasible. Also, accessible communities that are at low ri sk or are unlikely to contribute to endemism. Limited access communities : neither effective surveillance nor vaccination is feasible. Where possible surv eillance should be carried out. Interpretation of results should proceed with caution. In light of the security situation, it s eems unlikely that adequate access to the communities in the Sobat Basin will be possibl e in the short-term. Rather than designate this area as a surveillance zone, when adequate surveillance is not feas ible, their status as limited access communities should be clearly indi cated. This avoids false expectations. Surveillance should be carried out to the ex tent possible. Present information suggests Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 47that the surveillance system will need to depend on CAHWs and carefully selected Stockpersons. The approximate geographic extent of the v accination and surveillance zone is indicated in Figure 9. In the southern portion of the Ea st Nile Ecosystem, good access is enjoyed to large sub-sections of the Murle community from Paluer, Boma and Akobo. Several clans of the Jie are also accessible from Boma. Th e Toposa are accessible from two locations, Niangachor and Narus. Base d on the historical informa tion from Boma and Kurun indicating that at least parts of these commun ities have been involved within the last two to three years in rinderpest outbreaks, it is recommended that the Toposa are considered a surveillance and vaccination community. Vaccin ation of Dinka cattle from Paluer will protect the areas to the West of the Nile from reintroductions while the status of the East Nile Ecosystem is more carefully defined. Th e portions of the Mu rle and Jie community near Pibor should be consider ed limited access communities. Access to the Lotuko/Lopit and Boya/Didinga is variable. These communities are also small and isolated from the pastoral Murle and Karamojong cluster groups to the East. It is doubtful that these smaller communities could maintain rinderpest without the involvement of the larger populations to the East. The outbreak in 1998 in the Lopit hills was suggestive of an indicator population. These areas should be considered surveillance communities. The Anuak and Kachipo communities are small and peripheral to any possible endemic focus. It is recommended that vaccination is not resumed in Pochalla and that vaccination is not begun for the Kachipo. Table 16: Epidemiologic Categorization of Communities of the Ea st Nile Ecosystem Vaccination and Surveillance Communities: Toposa, Jie, Murle and the Sobat Basin and the Pibor Murle Where vaccination is carried out, it should be intensive. The target should be 100% coverage. The serological studies indicate that , in general, the deliv ery strategy has been effective in achieving 70 to 80% herd immun ity where it has been practiced. It was noted that in communities where CAHW programme s where implemented with intermittent support through short-term vis its, vaccination coverage was not adequate. Examples are Pochalla and Boma. The key is to focus re sources. The programme at Boma should be fully implemented with its own dedicated staff. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 48 Conflict resolution Cattle raiding has been a constraint to service delivery in the southern part of the East Nile Ecosystem. Although it does not normally place OLS Livestock Programme staff in danger, it hampers access to cattle across commun ity lines by restricting the movement of counterpart staff and frequently causes cattle camps to seek out more remote locations. In the past, raiding has all but eliminated acces s to the Murle from towns such as Paluer, Pochalla and Akobo. It is strongly recomme nded the OLS Livestock Programme consider introducing conflict resolution activities. It is suggested that peace meetings are held between the Anuak, Jie, Kachipo, Murle, Niagatom and Toposa. Increased access to livestock service delivery, am ong other services, should be presented as one of the benefits of peace. Epidemiologic assessme nt and surveillance More important than vaccination, is a comp lete understanding of the epidemiology of rinderpest in the region to direct control efforts. This can only be accomplished by an appropriate combination of epid emiologic study and surveillance. The accessible communities East of the Nile sh ould be systematically searched over the next dry season by a dedicated team to determine community consensus regarding the date of the last outbreak(s) in each locati on. The methodology used in this consultancy should be applied in more depth. It is recomm ended that at least 30 interviews be carried out in each community (or sub-community for the larger groups). The concept of surveillance is developed more fully in the next section. As requested by the terms of reference, ge neral suggestions and recommendations for an effective surveillance system are presented. Thereafte r, specific recommendations for surveillance in southern Sudan are provided. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 496. Participatory and Quantitative Epidemiology in CAPE and PACE Development and Promotion of Sustainable, National Epidemiology Units Building in sustainability National epidemiology projects often fail to thrive. In order to succeed, epidemiologic systems must be integrated into the overall animal health delivery system. Epidemiologic systems require partners to collect or provi de data and to carry out the interventions indicated by the conclusions of epidemiologic analysis. If these partners do not perceive the need for and experience the benefits of an epidemiologic system, the system will not be sustainable. The first step to establishing sustainable na tional epidemiology units is to identify the stakeholders or 'customers.' Potential cust omers include decision- makers, the livestock industry, public and private veterinary se rvice providers, and most importantly the livestock owners. The next step is to conduct a needs assessment. One might think of this as market research - What do our stakehol ders want for their time and money? The needs assessment has to identify feasible pr oducts that help the beneficiaries to reach their objectives. Participator y assessments and participator y epidemiology should be part of the design process of the national epidemiology units. Surveillance systems and epidemiologic studies One can distinguish between two types of epidemiological activities. The first is epidemiological studies that seek to collect baseline data on national livestock systems or detailed data on specific priority issu es. The second major activity is disease surveillance. Surveillance seeks to detect a nd investigate animal health events as they occur. In this sense, survei llance is about current events whereas studies tend to have a longer time horizon. Surveillance and studies ar e complimentary activities. Studies often provide the contextual inform ation required to correctly interpret surveillance data. Surveillance has been defined as informa tion for action. Surveill ance systems must not only collect representative and timely inform ation, they must process this information into useful products that have real world impact as events are occurring. Good surveillance data is essentia l to effective animal health decision-making and action. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 50Participatory epidemiology and national epidemiology systems Data is expensive and in shor t supply. In order to be sust ainable, national epidemiology units need to identify reliable and a ffordable data sources. Many conventional epidemiological methods are based on high cost approaches that ar e difficult to sustain, even in the developed world. In this regar d, participatory epidemiology has an important contribution to make. It provides timel y and cost-effective information. Although participatory epidemiology is most effectiv e in combination with laboratory-based epidemiology, participatory epidemiology is not fully dependent on slow or non- functional laboratory fa cilities. It often provides key in telligence when and where it is needed. Participatory epidemiologic approaches also as sure that the epidemiologic system is in direct contact with the livestock owners. As a result, outputs of epidemiologic systems that involve participatory data collection have a much greater chance of providing information that is actually relevant to producers. Participatory epidemiology has important c ontributions to make to both surveillance systems and epidemiological studies. The next section will define surveillance activities and describe a role for participation in survei llance. Thereafter, the role of participatory epidemiology in broader studies will be discussed. A national role for community-based disease surveillance Effective targeted surveillance programme s from the perspect ive of conventional systems have been described previously (M ariner et al., 1998; Ma riner et al., 1998). In conventional veterinary se rvice terms, 'the firs t line of defence is the farmer.' The source of most disease reports is the livestock owner. He either provides information or presents his animals for treatment. In order to have effective reporting, a pos itive interaction is required between the formal veterinary sector the livestock owning community. Community-based systems are a proven me thod for cultivating and maintaining a positive interaction and the community animal health worker is a major resource for surveillance systems. The key components of surveillance systems and the potential role of community-based disease surveillance include: General disease reporting : General disease reporting systems are routine systems for collection of data on the range and frequency of disease occurring in the field. Information from the monthly monitoring and reporting by CAHWs should be su mmarized by supervisors and incorporated in formal disease reporting channels. Targeted disease reporting : In the case of diseases targeted for control, specialised systems for sensitive a nd rapid reporting of all reports or intelligence is required. These usually include specialised disease report Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 51registers and predefined rapid commun ication channels. Livestock owners and CAHWs are the initial source of information. The CAHW monitoring process should be directly linke d to targeted disease reporting. Outbreak investigation : The approaches of participatory epidemiology are essential to the tracing of reports to active outbreaks for investigation and sampling. In effect, PE is analogous to a systematic method of history taking and herd health evaluation adapted to traditional livestock keeping systems. Through appropriate technology, CAHWs can collect samples suitable for laboratory analysis by se rologic and molecular techniques. Blood can be collected on filter paper or tissues can be collected in formalin or ethanol. The health worker must be interviewed to obtain the descriptive information to accompany samples. Laboratory diagnosis : Accurate descriptive clinical information is required to guide laboratory testing. Community-based approaches are key to obtaining valid and unbiased inform ation on the history and context of the cases. Serosurveillance : Quantitative serosurveillance has been incorporated in the OIE Pathway as a final validation of disease eradication. Accurate data on community structure and contact is essential to developing valid sampling regimes that are representative. In the absence of a best-bet scenar io on the history and dynamics of the disease in the community under stud y, serosurveillance data has often proved difficult to interpret, if not an outright enigma. Community-based disease surveillance has repeatedly provided a common sense check on the validity of laboratory-based studies on sample sets derived from the developing countries. In the case of lin eage 2 rinderpest, participatory data was the first indication that availa ble serologic tests were much less sensitive than assumed. Integrating community-based disease surveillance into national surveillance systems Regrettably, the interface between formal epidemiologic surveillance systems and community-based programmes has been the we ak link in the surveillance chain. This seems to stem in part from a disdain on th e part of many conventi onal veterinarians and quantitative epidemiologists to embrace the world of traditional knowledge and qualitative disease intelligence. A loss in confidence on the part of communities in the ability of veterinary services to respond has also contribut ed to the gap. If one views surveillance data as information for ac tion, but the action never comes, it is understandable that the information stops fl owing. Some approaches to minimizing the information gap are: 1. Avoid raising expectations . Be sure the means match the aspirations. Collect information that there is a reasonable capacity to act on. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 522. Involve disease-reporting personnel in community-based programme design and training. The national epidemiology units need to share in the ownership of the programmes. Community-based disease repo rting in southern Sudan is productive because all formally trained staff are involved in the community-based system. 3. Promote dialogue and needs assessment. Hold national or sub-national workshops that involve epidemiologists, comm unity-based programmes staff, CAHW supervisors and CAHWs. 4. Provide training on PE methods to professionals. Expose professionals to the methods of PE and community-based programmes through training workshops that provide theory and practical experien ce. Break out into field groups with an assignment. Ask the groups to describe the dynamics of a disease in a community using PE data and compare the results of the break out groups in discussion. 5. Include PE methods in veterinary curricula. Role models and examples of successful programmes define the profe ssional expectations and ethics of young veterinarians. In order to produce profe ssionals with appropriate value systems and expectations, realistic models adapted to local needs must be taught in school. 6. Provide feedback and take action. CAHW supervisors, as with any data collectors, must see the results of their efforts. Communities need to see that their information results in access to the ri ght interventions in a timely manner. To be sure, participatory epidemiology has its limitations and is not a panacea. But the real output from statistical epidemiology in the developing world has been very limited. Even for important human diseases such as malaria, quantitative information is too expensive relative to the available investment in health. The most effective surveillance system will be based on appropriate comb inations of qualitative and quantitative epidemiology using both conventional and community-based methods. Epidemiologic Intelligence Gather ing for Control/Eradication of Major Epizootic Disease (Rinderpest, CBPP, FMD). Participatory disease search ing and scenario building Participatory disease searching is the pro cess of using particip atory rural appraisal techniques to derive a best bet epidemiol ogic scenario that desc ribes the history and dynamics of a disease in a population or comm unity. In essence it is targeted disease investigation using participatory epidemiologi c techniques. It was the approach used in this consultancy in the field in southern S udan. It is a sensitive, rapid and low cost method for locating active disease. The tec hniques were summarized in the introduction to the section of this report on the field investigation. A how to manual with detailed discussion on the use of PDS for rinderpes t investigation has been published by FAO (Mariner, 2000). In order to use PDS, the target disease must be clinically recognizable and a priority for the beneficiaries. It should form a pa rt of the existing veterinary knowledge. Some uses of PDS are: Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 53 Outbreak investigation: Disease outbreak reports can be rapidly and sensitively investigated by PDS. Once clinical ca ses are located, sampling for laboratory confirmation is appropriate. Strategy formulation : An epidemiologic scenario on the history and dynamics of a disease in a population is the essential basi s for defining an effective and targeted strategy for disease control/eradication. Eradication verification : Participatory disease searchi ng can be used as a sensitive method to verify the eradication of a di sease from a community. In order to do this a sufficient number of interviews n eeds to be conducted relative to the size and diversity of the population under study. It is recommended that PACE integrate a PDS approach into the suite of epidemiologic tools for the control and erad ication of epizootics. The ne xt section presents a brief concept on the integration of participat ory disease searchi ng and participatory epidemiology into the PACE strategy formula tion process with particular reference to CBPP. The dynamics of disease endemism and the development of effective control/eradication strategies The PACE programme has a broad mandate to develop epidemiologic capacity, establish effective strategies for trans-boundary diseas e control, and intern ationally coordinate disease control efforts. Within the context of PACE, the CAPE Unit is to contribute to these goals through the development of effectiv e service delivery to communities and the development of participatory surveillance a nd epidemiological data collection methods. The CAPE Unit seeks to integrate partic ipatory epidemiology into conventional epidemiologic delivery systems. This include s both participatory di sease surveillance and participatory epidemiologic study methods. Because of the limitations of conventional ep idemiology, strategies for disease treatment and control in the pastoral setting have la rgely been based on assumptions or adaptation of methods from more sedentary livestock keeping systems. An understanding of the dynamics of endemism of infectious and vect or borne agents in pastoral systems is a prerequisite for the design of effective c ontrol and eradication st rategies. The methods used in this consultancy to study rinderpe st are a good example of how PACE and CAPE can meet this challenge and should be appl ied to other disease control initiatives. To date, some progress has been made on the understanding of the dynamics of selected disease in the pastoral setting through participatory epidemio logic studies. Examples of such studies exist for rinderpest (Mariner and Flanagan, 1996), tr ypanosomosis (Catley and Irungu, 2001) and mixed parasitism (Catley et al, 2001). However, there is definite need to continue to develop data and in telligence on the ecology of rinderpest in the southern Sudan and Somali areas. Other diseas es included in the PACE mandate such as CBPP, FMD and vector borne disease are actual ly of higher priority to livestock owners Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 54on a day-to-day basis. These diseases, es pecially CBPP, warrant study with methods appropriate to the realities of the pastoral setting. Although participatory epidemiology is establis hed as an approach, full development of the potential of participatory epidemiology has not yet been realized. The integration of participatory epidemiology and conventional quantitative epidemiologic analysis as a cost effective and pragmatic approach to pr oviding epidemiologic services to livestock owners has only just begun. Many participatory techniques have yet to be adapted and evaluated as tools for epidemio logic data collection. The adapta tion of statistic al analysis to participatory epidemiologic data and the in corporation of particip atory data into more conventional epidemiologic surveillance systems, studies and models is an activity of the CAPE Unit that should be emphasized. The perceived importance of CBPP by both lives tock owners and animal health experts make this disease a logical focal point for the epidemiological activities of PACE and CAPE. The existing strategies for the cont rol of CBPP are costly and logistically demanding. A major source of difficulty is the short duration of imm unity generated by available vaccines and variability in the immune response among vaccinated animals. The limits of available diagnostic tests compounded by the difficulty in detecting asymptomatic carriers further complicate the control of CBPP. The prominence of movement control in CBPP strategies suggest s that the control of CBPP in pastoral situations will be ex tremely challenging. Participatory epidemiologic approach in comb ination with the strategic use of laboratory testing can provide cost effective and timely insights into the dynamics and impact of endemic CBPP in pastoral societies. Techni ques such as semi-structured interviews, mapping, progeny history analysis, proporti onal piling and seasonal calendars are available to collect informati on on morbidity, mortality, response to treatment, recurrence of disease, the temporal and spatial disease distribution, herd demographics, age structure and contact structure. Many of the data collection exercises utilized in participatory epidemiology can generate quantitative data. One of the strengths of par ticipatory epidemiology is the flexibility of the approach. This facilitates the discovery process where new unforeseen information can guide and shape the data collection process while it is already underway. The concept of key informants is central to participat ory information collection. Key informants are people or groups of people who are likely to have special insight into the issues of interest. Information and intelligence derived from key informants is a form of expert opinion. Due to the high cost of data, di sease modelling, economic modelling and risk analysis in the developed world rely heavily on expert opinion. It is appropriate that PACE and CAPE promote the use of existi ng veterinary knowledge provided by key informants as a source of expert opinion for epidemiologic analysis. One of the criticisms of models is that th ey can become disconnected from the situation on the ground and reflect the opinion of techni cal experts rather th an actual social and epidemiologic realities. The use of particip atory epidemiology as a source of data and Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 55expert opinion is a logical and cost-effec tive solution. In the context of rinderpest dynamics in the pastoral setti ng, livestock owner's perceptions have repeatedly caused a reassessment of conventional wisdom among pr ofessionals. Participatory epidemiologic studies on CBPP will probably make similar discoveries. The author proposes that PACE should focus a portion of their epidemiologic resources on the development of the inte rface between appropriate pastor al data collection methods and epidemiologic analysis relevant to disease control strategy. The focus of these efforts should be on CBPP, however further progre ss can be made on rinde rpest simultaneously. The first phase should be participatory data collection on key parameters regarding the dynamics and impact of CBPP. In order not to bias respondents and capture added value, information on rinderpest, FMD and vector bo rne disease can be collected concurrently. In addition, information of general epidemio logic value to multiple diseases on herd demographics and the contact structure of the community should be collected. One to two communities should be identifie d. Candidate communities include the Murle and Jie communities accessible from Boma in the southern Sudan and the groups using the Kagera Valley in Tanzania. Selection of Boma as the study site offers an opportunity to better understand rinderpe st epidemiology in the southe rn portion of the East Nile Ecosystem as an added benefit. The following indicators or CBPP parameters should be accessed by participatory and/or serologic methods: Infection rates Existing veterinary termi nology and case definitions Morbidity and mortality rates Herd size and age structure Herd mobility and movement patterns Community structure and contac t levels between sub-groups Response to treatment Conventional expert opinion should also be collected through consultation with CBPP experts. This could take the form of a brain storming session to develop and refine questions followed by individual in terviews to collect responses. Screening with the complement fixation test followed by confirmatory testing with competitive ELISA can give an objective estima te of active infections as antibody titres from both vaccination and infec tion are short lived. This information in combination with herd demographics can be used in derivi ng estimates of the basic reproduction number, R o, from simple modelling relationships under an assumption of endemic stability. Once the field data is available, the analyti cal phase should begin with the estimation of the basic reproductive number, R o, and other parameter as poi nt values and probability distributions using quantitative methods and ex cepted approaches for modelling expert Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 56opinion. In this second phase, model developm ent and experimentation can be used to test the impact of control options. The first step should a sensitivity analysis to establish the relative importance of model parameters in determining the course of CBPP in a population. This step may highlight further data needs that require a brief return to the field. The effect of interventions on disease persistence, likelihood of disease fade-out and the effective reproductive number, R e, should then be examined in the model. Combinations and schedules of vaccination, testing, reduction in contact rate (quarantine), removal of infectious animals and treatment can be cons idered. The objective would be to develop a more pragmatic strategy for CB PP control and eradication or identify the threshold of intervention efficacy or acti ons required for control. Epidemiologic Surveillance in Southern Sudan Current activities At the time of the consultant's mission, se veral activities were underway to strengthen surveillance. A workshop was held to begi n implementation of expanded activities and efforts were underway to collate data collected ov er the last decade or more on disease reporting, serosurveillance activ ities and population estimates . Draft data from these efforts has been provided to the consultant by Byrony Jones and was used as the basis for some of the summaries presented in this re port. The reader is re quested to consult the final report of Dr. Jone s for the detailed data. Disease reporting and investigation The consultant noted that a robust disease reporting and investig ation system was in place in southern Sudan. An officer was a ppointed to oversee disease reporting and support field investigations. Very complete di sease investigation kits had been prepared and distributed to 35 field locations. The disease reporting system in southern Sudan involved the community and outbreak reports for a number of diseas es were received. The main so urce of reports was livestock owners and CAHWs. It was gr atifying to see that reports of suspected rinderpest or stomatitis-enteritis were being forward and investigated wherever feasible. Table 17 presents annual statistics and performance analysis. The quantity of data suggest that disease reporting and investigation is being applied more diligently in southern Sudan than in many other regions participating in PACE. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 57Table 17: Disease Reporting Statistics for 1998-2000 Year Disease Reports Stomatitis-Enteritis Reports Percent Investigated 1998 26 8 75% 1999 57 11 73% 2000 66 13 77% Source: Gachengo Matindi Receipt of reports of SE outbreaks does not in dicate that rinderpest is present. It does confirm that the surveillance is ongoing. Wh ere reports can be fully investigated, negative outcomes raise the level of confidence regarding the absence of disease. Of the 8 reports that could not be investigated on s ite, 7 were in the East Nile Ecosystem. Serosurveillance The OLS Livestock Programme has given signif icant attention to the collection of sera for seromonitoring purposes, but has pl ace limited emphasis on serosurveillance for evidence of disease circulati on. Most sample sets come fr om vaccinated populations. The serological data has been useful in conf irming the efficacy of the focused vaccination programme. The technique of collecting blood on filter pape rs for serology has been distributed to most OLS Livestock Programme sites. At the moment, the technique has not been implemented at the level of CAHWs, as they are unable to record the background information on the papers. Large numbers of sera have been collected and are awaiting testing. Laboratory support At present, most diagnostic and serologic samples are se nt to Muguga. Turn around time on suspected rinderpest samples is reasonable, however there is a very large backlog on serologic samples that covers more than a years worth of samples. The SCF laboratory at Lokichokio serves as a staging area for the processing and forwarding of samples to Nairobi. It also offe rs simple diagnostic services including the examination of blood smears, faecal samples a nd skin scrapings as well as brucellosis testing. Although the mission received prompt a ssistance with several requests to the laboratory, reports of delayed f eedback or misplaced samples were also received. In the case of misplaced samples, the submitting agency left the samples in a vaccine carrier in the OLS veterinary office when all staff where in the field. These simple procedures provide feedback to field staff on sample submission and if completed in a timely manner greatly encourage disease re porting and field investigation. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 58Suggestions for strengthening surveillance Due to the patchy nature of access to southe rn Sudan, surveillance based on randomised sampling is not possible. Several methods recommended in the OIE Pathway are based on randomised sampling designs to detect dise ase with predetermined confidence levels at a hypothetical prevalence (Anon,1982). Lack of random access means that it is not possible to estimate quantitative epidemiological parameters at levels above the local community. Several of the measures required by the OIE Pathway lack biological coherence. They do not take into consideration the transmission dynamics of rinderpest. The requirement to conduct randomised serosurveillance to high confidence levels for the detection of disease at 1% prevalence le vels is a prime example. Bearing in mind concepts such as critical community size, the high levels of herd immunity consistent with circulati on of an endemic disease with an R o of 4 to5, and the heterogeneous population structure of southern Sudan, it should be possible to complete and verify the eradication of rinderpest in the absence of randomised sampling designs. This will require the formulation of speci fic surveillance plans for each community. Surveillance should target communities and sampling should be purposive. That means that each surveillance exercise should explic itly state the hypothe sis being tested. The most common question will be: Is rinderpest ci rculating in a particular circumscribed community? A definition of the community under evaluation is an integral part of the hypothesis. An example would be a list of clans or cattle camps included in the population and the range of movements and interactions with other communities. Participatory disease search vs . random clinical surveillance Clinical surveillance is the process of search ing for clinical disease by examining cattle. This process has sometimes been recomme nded on a random basis as a surveillance method for rinderpest. Given the short duration of clinical signs, it is undoubtedly a very insensitive and inefficient met hod of searching for rinderpest. Participatory disease searching is the most sensitive way to find clinical cases. It takes advantage of the tremendous reach of local knowledge and communication systems. Once suspect animals or herds are identified, c linical investigation is appropriate. The process of participatory disease searching was described in the section on the field investigations. Organizationally, disease searching is a rela tively specialised activity and is best implemented under the immediate guidance of a sm all team of trained individuals. It is recommended that at least two specialised o fficers are identified for this assignment for the duration of the 2001/02 dry season, one fo r the East and one for the West Nile Ecosystems. It is important that the method is applied consistently and that the group is Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 59small enough to communicate directly and freel y on the interpretation of results. Only one individual from the team needs to travel to each community to carry out the PDS. The interview team on the ground should incorp orate local NGO and co unterpart staff to bring a variety of perspectives to the exercise and provide a sense of ownership of the results of search to the local stakeholders. In the past, it seems that OLS veterinarians ha ve largely been acting as data collectors. A large body of data covering several years' wo rk is only now being analysed. Analysis should be an on going process that continually informs and updates the data collection process. In limited access areas, it may be feasible to train counterpart staff in the PDS approach and for them to carry out ri nderpest assessments independent ly. Trainees would need to be carefully selected. A pilot workshop c ould be organized to provide training on techniques. Sample data should be provided a nd participants will need to break out into groups to interpret it. Most importantly fiel d exercises should be incorporated in the programme. Market surveillance The consultant was informed that mark et surveillance activities are now being implemented as part of the surveillance pr ogramme in south Sudan. This is a very sensitive method and should incorporate semi-s tructured interviews as well as clinical inspections. Market interviews could also be incorporated in PDS work. Disease reporting and investigation The system of community-based disease reporti ng could be further reinforced through the provision of rewards for information leadi ng to the identification of SE cases for sampling. CAHW supervisors can be provide d with disposable cameras and photographs of SE lesions should be considered as a m eans of verification. The incentive should be moderate but reward all levels of the reporting/investigation system. Laboratory testing The SCF laboratory should be supported and mo destly expanded. The laboratory serves a very positive role in provid ing feedback on a proportion of submissions and disease reports. Timely feedback is essential to the continued participation of stakeholders and the success of the su rveillance effort. Efforts should be made to streamline sample submission and the reporting of results through the establishment of standard operating procedures and identification of points of contact. This information should be distribut ed to all agencies involved by E-mail and discussed as part of one of the routine coordination meeti ngs. Some simple performance indicators can be established to monitor the laboratory. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 60Examples are: Percent of sample submissi ons received in good condition For samples received in good conditions for in-house tes ting, percent of submissions for which results were reported within 7 days The value of serosurveillance data deteriorates with time. The current turn around time in serological studies is not compatible with th e success of surveillance efforts. Comments from field staff reflected a demoralised atmos phere with regard to the collection of serum samples. Interest in the collection of filter papers has declined because counterparts are yet to hear the results of their efforts. A sustainable method of supporting the regional diagnostic laboratory at Muguga must be found or alternative-testi ng facilities should be id entified without delay. The consultant recommends that routine ELI SA testing on samples from areas such as south Sudan and Somalia be put out to tender for the current phase of PACE. The terms of the tender could include an advance paymen t that would allow for the procurement of equipment and reagents and a per test paym ent. Government-owned laboratories with independent accounting practices should be allowed to comp ete. Penalties similar to those stipulated in supply contracts shoul d apply for the late reporting of results. Purposive serosurveillance As access is gained to non-vaccinated popul ations, every effort should be made to conduct purposive surveys to detect and date circ ulation of rinderpest virus. If it has been more than two years since the last vacci nation, purposive sampling can detect the circulation of virus in young animals. If it ha s only been one year since vaccination, the age band of seronegative animals is narrow and results are difficult to interpret. The sample should be age structured using the st andard approach and serum collection forms. Recording the best estimate of the age of animals would provide additional information, allow estimation of the basic reproductive num ber and assist the da ting of historical rinderpest outbreaks. It is suggested that at leas t 10 non-vaccinated herds are sampled and that at least 200 sera are collected. These numbers are arbitrarily selected and do not have statistical significance. Remember that the objective is not just to detect circ ulation, but to also estimate the date since the last outbreak. Examples of opportunities to conduct extremel y useful purposive surveys in East Nile Ecosystem are: Murle from o Boma o Paluer Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 61o Akobo Newly accessed Nuer and Dinka communities in the Sobat Basin In order to be really valuable a brief (one page) narrative re port should be a ttached to the sample logs. The report should describe: The reason for sampling - the hypothesis being tested A description of the community sampled A sketch map of the community's location and movements Information on contacts with other communities Area vaccination history Information on last reported outbreak Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 62 Annex 1: Terms of Reference TERMS OF REFERENCE Community-based Animal Health and Pa rticipatory Epidemiology Unit (CAPE) Pan African Campaign for the Control of Epizootics (PACE) Organisation of African Unity/Inter-Africa Bureau for Animal Resources (OAU/IBAR) Consultancy to assist in the developmen t of a rinderpest eradication strategy In the West Nile and East Nile Ecosystems Background Within the Pan African Campaign for the C ontrol of Epizootics (PACE), the Community- based Animal Health and Participatory Ep idemiology (CAPE) Unit has the mandate to support community-based delivery systems for th e control of epizootic and other diseases in marginalized pastoral ecosystems. This role includes the further development and testing of appropriate disease investiga tion and surveillance methods, particularly participatory methods, in resour ce-poor pastoral ecosystems. Due to long-term conflict in Sudan, the West Nile* and East Nile** Ecosys tems present special challenges to disease control programmes and consequently, parts of these ecosystems are considered to be among the few remaining foci of rinderpest in Africa. The UNICEF Operation lifeline Sudan (Southern Sector) Live stock Programme has been co-ordinating a community-based animal health worker (CAHW) programme in southern Sudan since 1989. A key feature of this pr ogramme was an innovative approach to rinderpest control us ing CAHWs to deliver heat-sta ble vaccine. Despite severe operational constraints, the approach result ed in a substantial reduction in rinderpest outbreaks in southern Sudan a nd this situation has been ma intained up until the present day. This achievement was recognised by OVU/IBAR and the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme as one of the ke y successes of the Pan African Rinderpest Campaign (PARC). In 1998 and with support from PARC, the UNI CEF-OLS programme began to consider options for assisting southern Sudan to follow the OIE pathway for rinderpest eradication. At this time, the pr eferred option was to use the na tural barrier of the Nile to create the West and East Nile zone was considered suitable for the introduction of community-based active surveillance whereas the East Nile included some key inaccessible areas where little was known about the rinderpes t situation and vaccination programmes had not been widely implemente d. These areas included Pibor/Boma and the Sobat Basin. When applied correctly, methods such as participatory disease searching provide opportunities to improve understanding of rinderpest in these locations and use the information gained to inform a rinderpes t eradication strategy for southern Sudan. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 63 In addition to operational context and condi tions, the design of a disease eradication programme depends on the epidemiology of th e disease agent and the characteristics of the curative or preventive measures availa ble. In the case of vaccines, important characteristics include the proportion of animals vaccinated that are protected, the duration of protection and the coverage ach ieved by the vaccination programme. The most important epidemiological parameter is the basic reproductive number R. epidemiological theory can use this inform ation to guide the design of eradication programmes by assessing the feasibility of er adication, the proportion and age of animals to be vaccinated, the vaccin ation interval and the durat ion of vaccination programme required. To date, mathematical models have been used to describe viral diseases such as rabies, foot and mouth diseas e, and African horse sickness , but modelling of rinderpest has been limited. It seems likely that the de velopment of models for rinderpest would assist PACE, CAPE and OLS to develop an a ppropriate eradication strategy for the West Nile and East Nile Ecosystems according to field conditions and the OIE pathway. The epidemiological methods used during the consultancy can be regarded as extremes on a scale moving from qualitative, field-level data gathering (not as sisted by computers) to quantitative, theoretical modelling (highly dependent on computers). Therefore, the consultancy is an opportunity to compare tw o very different epidemiological methods and provide guidance on the use and promo tion of these methods by PACE and CAPE. Specific Tasks 1. Train veterinarians in the participatory disease searching methodology. 2. With OLS, conduct a comprehensive particip atory disease search for rinderpest in SPLM-controlled areas of Eastern Equatoria, Jonglei and Eastern Upper Nile (this work will complement similar searches in Government of Sudan controlled areas). 3. According to the quantity and quality of data available on rinderpest in southern Sudan, determine whether the basic repr oductive number can be calculated for rinderpest in Sudanese ar eas of the West Nile and East Nile Ecosystems. 4. Based on the outcome of Specific Task 3. above, propose approaches for determining the role of mass vaccination in achieving suffi cient levels of herd immunity for the termination and/or prevention of rinder pest outbreaks in southern Sudan. 5. If herd immunity is considered to vary widely between communities, advise how this situation will affect the epidemiology of rinderpest in southern Sudan in the long- term. Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 646. Based on the results of Specific Tasks 2 to 5 above plus an analysis of operational and logistical factors, an d organisation capacities, design a protocol for rinderpest eradication in Sudanese areas of the East Nile and West Nile Ecosystems. 7. Assess the role of the methods used during the consultancy in re lation to the outputs of CAPE and PACE viz. development of community-based disease surveillance in pastoral areas (CAPE) and development and promotion of sustainable, national epidemiology units (PACE). Issues to cons ider include the pros and cons of the methods in pastoral areas; role in nati onal epidemiology units; relative value of the methods for on of major epizootic diseas e (rinderpest, CBPP, FMD). Time input 56 days, being 28 days in southern Sudan and 28 days in Nairobi. Qualifications and experience required 1 consultant is required with the fo llowing qualifications and experience: Degree in veterinary medicine with specialised knowledge of mathematical modelling. Field experience in pastoral areas affected by conflict, preferab ly in southern Sudan. Practical experience of participatory disease search ing, preferably for rinderpest.

Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 66Annex 2: PRA Checklist Chiefs and elders or small groups of cattle ow ners were interviewed. Separate interviews were conducted with key informants such as official chiefs and ve terinary authorities. The interview team never mentioned rinderpes t before the cattle owners introduced the subject. 1. Introductions: identify the re spondents and establish if they own cattle owners. 2. Establish their main herding locations. 3. What are the current cattle di sease problems in their herd? If tearing or diarrhoea is mentione d, explore these syndromes in detail. 4. What are the current cattle disease problems in the area? 5. Historically, what are the most im portant disease problems of cattle? Rinderpest is frequently mentioned as one response to this question. 6. Have they seen it in their lif etimes? What does it look like? 7. When was the last time their cattle wher e affected by rinderpest? Where? Where did it come from? 8. Were their cattle affected by rinderpest in any previous times? What years? Where? As warranted, further probing questions can be added to cross check reports made in other interviews, further define cattle move ments which may affect the epidemiology of the disease. Mapping of herding movements was completed as part of most interviews. Proportional piling exercises on herd age structure and rinder pest mortality were completed as part of all interviews after the first day. If the respondent mentions rinderpest, always request a description and validate the term.

Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 68Annex 3: Rinderpest Model Structure Closed Population Model The SEIR model is a state tr ansition model with 4 states: Susceptible - Animals fully susceptible to infection, Exposed - Animals latently infected and not yet shedding virus, Infectious - Animals infected and shedding virus in sufficient quantity to transmit the disease, Recovered - Animals that are no longer shedding virus and considered immune. All animals in the model fall into one of the four states and members of each state transition between states according to rate equations. The model uses a discrete time step of T and expresses the transi tion rate equations as difference equations. The model tracks the population over 3650 time steps. If the time step is set to 0.1 days, this is equivalent to one-year . Initial values are entered for the total population size (N), initial number exposed to RP (E), the initial number infectious or shedding virus (I) and the initial number recove red or vaccinated (R). The initial number susceptible (S) is calculated by the model as: S = N - (E+I+R) For each time step the model calculates the change ( ) in the number of animals in each of the four SEIR states. The difference equations are: S = -cp(IS/N)( T) E = +cp(IS/N)( T) - E(T) I = +E(T) - I(T) R = +I(T) Where the parameters are defined as: alpha: rate of recovery/removal (=1/infectious period) Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 69 gamma: transition rate from exposed to infectious state (=1/latent period) c number of physical contacts per day p probability that one contact results in transmission Once the change is calculated, the total numbers of animals in each SEIR state in the new time step are calculated by adding the change in number to previous total to obtain the new total. S t+1 = S t + S Et+1 = E t + E It+1 = I t + I Rt+1 = R t + R Open Population Model The open model has the same general struct ure as the closed model except that the transition rate equations incorporate terms for birth, non-specific mortality, and mortality from rinderpest. As the total population size changes, it must be recalculated in each time step. For this reason, the mass action term (IS/N) is replaced by IS/(S+E+I+R) in the open population model. The difference equations have the following form: S = -cp(IS/(S+E+I+R)( T) +b(S+E+I+R)( T) - \u00b5(S)(T) E = +cp(IS/(S+E+I+R)( T) - E(T) - \u00b5(E)(T) I = +E(T) - - (I)(T) R = +I(T) - \u00b5R(T) Where 'b' is the birth rate, \u00b5 is the non-specific mortality rate and is the rinderpest specific mortality rate.Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 70 Annex 5: Stomatitis-Enteritis Sample Collection In the event cases are observed that meet the SE Outbreak Definition, samples should be collected from all affected animals for labor atory diagnosis. Recent, acute cases are the best subjects for virus isolation, antigen detection, or RT-PCR. Live affected animals: ocular and nasal swabs (essential) scrapings of oral lesions serum prescapular lymph node aspirates (optional) If available, perform a Clearview tests on site. Be sure to conserve sufficient swab sample for confirmatory tests such as RT-PCR, immunocapture ELISA or AGID. Herd or in contact animals: serum Sacrificed or deceased animals: 10 gm samples of fresh spleen, mesenteric lymph node and tonsil eyelids in formalin 10 gm blocks of spleen, lymph node a nd tonsil in formalin and ethanol Comments: For most viral diseases, pathogens are most eas ily detected in the acu te phase just at the onset of symptoms. This is particularly true for rinderpest and ev ery effort should be made to sample animals in the phase after the onset of fever and before the onset of diarrhoea. Usually, tearing a nd oral erosions appear duri ng this 48-hour period. Thus, the herder can be asked to point out animals that just started tearing within the last 24 hours but have not started to show signs diarrhoea, if diarrhoea is a feature of the outbreak. If the SE outbreak is not associated with mo rtality, sampling will have to focus on ocular and nasal swabs, scrapings of oral lesions and serum. Lymph node aspirates can also be collected, but offer no particular advantage over good ocular swabs. If a high index of suspicion exists that the SE outbreak is ri nderpest, the appraisal team can request the herders to sacrifice an animal or offer to buy a sick animal for post mortem. However, even full payment may be refused. As a general rule, serum should be collected from the entire herd. In the event that moribund cases or recently deceased cattle are present, an autopsy should be completed and tissue samples shoul d be collected. Fresh and formalin fixed tissues should be collected. Definitive diagnos is can be made on ti ssue samples collected Rinderpest Eradication Strategy in the Nile Ecosystem CAPE Unit, PACE Programme 71in formal using simple immunohistochemical techniques. Samples collected up to 24 or 48 hours post mortem are diagnostic. Eyelids ha ve been shown to be the most useful sample for immunohistochemistry and are al so easy to collect (Brown et al., 1996).
