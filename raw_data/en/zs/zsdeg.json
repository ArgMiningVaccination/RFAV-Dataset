The public desire for the integration of \"alternative\" or \"unconventional\"treatment approaches into conventional health care settings has been well documented. Physiciandissatisfaction with the current system of care is also prevalent, with the limitations imposed bymanaged care as a major contributing factor.Integrative medicine is a new approach to medicine that embraces the concerns of the publicand medical profession for more effective, compassionate, patient-centered medicine. Integrativemedicine has been defined as healing-oriented medicine that takes account of the whole person (body,mind, and spirit), including all aspects of lifestyle.\u0000It emphasizes the therapeutic relationship andmakes use of all appropriate therapies, both conventional and alternative.2 Over the past 10 years, thenumber of medical schools providing education related to integrative medicine has grown rapidly. Asof 1998, 64% of schools responding to a survey in the United States had curriculum offerings in thisarea.3 However, many of these offerings have been elective and thus not part of the learningexperience of most students. In addition, different areas of content and instructional strategies havebeen used to teach topics in integrative medicine. The wide variation in content and delivery stems inpart from the absence of explicitly designed educational objectives and learner outcomes forintegrative medicine. The development of student competencies in integrative medicine and methodsfor evaluating curricular interventions is only underway at a few institutions.4Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine (CAHCIM)In response to the need for a more coherent response to this new area within academicmedicine, the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine (CAHCIM) was formedin 1999 with eight member institutions.5 The Consortium has met twice since this initial meeting andis now comprised of 22 member schools.*1The mission of CAHCIM is to \"help transform healthcarethrough rigorous scientific studies, new models of clinical care, and innovative educational programsthat integrate biomedicine, the complexity of human beings, the intrinsic nature of healing, and therich diversity of therapeutic systems.\" Criteria for admission to CAHCIM include:a) Meeting the criteria of the Association of Academic Health Centers (AAHC) defining anAcademic Health Center. 6b) Having an established program in integrative medicine that includes ongoing work in morethan one of three areas: research, education, and clinical activity.c) Having the institutional commitment of the health center with regard to institutionalmovement in the field of integrative medicine, as evidenced by expressed support from seniorleadership (Chancellor or Dean) of the health center.In 2001, a subgroup of the Consortium began to work on guidelines for assisting medicalschools in their design of integrative medicine curriculum activities. As a first step, this EducationWorking Group developed a set of competencies that delineated the values, knowledge, attitudes, andskills that CAHCIM believes are fundamental to the field of integrative medicine. These competencieswere endorsed by the CAHCIM Steering Committee in May 2003, and an article outlining themappears in the June 2004 issue of Academic Medicine.7 Many of these competencies re-affirmhumanistic values inherent to the practice of all medical specialties, while others are specific to * Albert Einstein, Columbia, Duke, George Washington, Georgetown, Harvard, Jefferson, Oregon Health Sciences University,University of Arizona, University of Calgary, University of California at Los Angeles, University of California at San Francisco,University of Hawaii, University of Massachusetts, University of Maryland, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey,University of Minnesota, University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh, University of Texas atGalveston, University of WashingtonIntroduction to Integrative Medicine Curriculum Guide CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 11\"unconventional\" approaches to health and healing. These competencies are presented in Section 2 ofthis guide and can be used by medical institutions as a framework for developing curriculum and forevaluation of programs in integrative medicine.CAHCIM Curriculum Implementation GuideThe Integrative Medicine Curriculum Guide is offered to assist medical educators as theymove to develop curricular materials to effectively address these competencies. The guide containssamples of materials that were contributed by medical educators from a number of US medical schoolsto illustrate approaches to introducing CAM and integrative medicine topics. CAHCIM members wereinvited to submit curriculum samples currently in use that address one or more of the competencies inintegrative medicine and that might be shared as a template for adaptation within other medicalschools. Samples presented in this guide are not intended to be comprehensive. Our goal is torepresent offerings from a variety of medical schools that can be employed at different levels withinthe four years of medical school. The curriculum examples represented cover a variety of topics andincorporate the many approaches to facilitating effective learning. Table 1 (see page 9) outlines thetypes of curricular activities contained in this guide.For first and second year students, the guide includes, among other courses, an overalllecture-type introduction to CAM for entering first year students that is followed by a field tripcomponent and reflective small-group discussion; an introduction to Herbal Medicine presented aspart of a second-year pharmacology course; a Web-based interactive learning unit on Spirituality inmedicine; cases illustrating an evidence-based approach to applications of CAM; and a standardizedpatient experience to permit practice and evaluation. For students in the third and fourth years, weinclude descriptions of some of the in-depth elective experiences available in this area. In eachmodule, the materials contributed by the medical schools are preceded by an outline of goals andobjectives, specific learning outcomes from the CAHCIM competencies, learning methodology,illustrations of application, reflection questions to encourage deeper understanding, implementationchallenges, and proposed evaluation strategies.\u0000Challenges in implementationGiven the divergent nature of unconventional therapies and the varying levels of evidencethat supports their use, the integration of topics in complementary and alternative medicine intoconventional medical education poses a unique challenge.8\u0000 Innovative educational approaches arerequired to achieve an effective understanding of the principles and practice of integrative medicine.These approaches demand that we develop methods beyond those needed to teach new scientific facts.Two particularly important components for effective implementation of teaching in integrativemedicine, which are not typically part of medical school curricula, are the use of experientialapproaches to facilitate an understanding of complementary and alternative therapies, and theeducation of medical students in self-care and reflection. Examples of both are provided in thecurriculum modules in this guide.Perhaps the most significant challenge posed by the introduction of integrative medicinecompetencies into the conventional medical school curriculum at many schools is finding time forthem.9 Educators at a number of schools have addressed this problem by working to incorporateteaching on integrative medicine into existing courses rather than looking to establish new courses.For example, introducing information on taking an effective history of a patient's use of CAMmodalities into the interviewing course has been an effective strategy; another example would beintegrating a patient's use of CAM modalities into an existing standardized patient encounter orproblem-based learning case rather than trying to find room for an entirely new session covering onlyIntroduction to Integrative Medicine Curriculum Guide CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 13an integrative medicine topic. One example of such an approach in this guide is Temple University'sstandardized patient case of an older woman's desire to address her menopause symptoms usingalternative therapies that is part of the advanced doctor-patient interviewing course. Anotherillustration of how to incorporate teaching on integrative medicine into existing programs is JeffersonMedical College's introduction to addressing herbal medicine, which is provided within the existingpharmacology course. This \"integrative\" approach to the time challenge avoids many of the powerand political struggles that typically govern allocation of time in the preclinical curriculum. It is alsomore in keeping with the ultimate goal of having this material thoroughly integrated into the entiremedical school curriculum rather than standing alone in either a required or an elective course.A second, and perhaps equally difficult, challenge is that an integrative medicine curriculumincludes material that may not be recognized en face as core medical content. Concepts are presentedthat have been excluded or marginalized by the current biomedical paradigm. For example, traditionalhealing systems include the concept of a life force, theories of spiritual causation, and therapeuticsbased on interconnectedness of healer and patient. Another example is the importance placed byintegrative medicine on studying dimensions of illness and healing that cannot be captured throughquantitative analysis. Integrative medicine therefore makes use of supplemental lines of inquirymethods including self-reflection, participant-observation, qualitative research methods, historicalreview, and cultural studies. By bridging biomedicine with alternative healing paradigms, integrativemedicine creates opportunities for students (and faculty) to become philosophers of science,challenging them to critically reflect upon core philosophical assumptions underlying diverse models.Experiential learningExperience, within the context of the application, provides the deepest levels ofunderstanding. Providing learners with an opportunity to experience and reflect on learning is key tobuilding competence within a domain. Teaching alternative medical practices and systems (e.g.,acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Ayurveda (and other traditional healingpractices), mind-body interventions (meditation, hypnosis, etc.), would be straightforward ifintroducing these therapies only required the presentation of new facts. However, systems such asTraditional Chinese Medicine are complex and are founded on paradigms that differ significantly fromthe allopathic medical model. Teaching these topics solely through a didactic format, althoughnecessary as a start, may not be sufficient to develop a real understanding. A lecture on acupunctureis unlikely to capture the sensate experience of having an acupuncture needle placed or the deeprelaxation that may be experienced through a practice such as tai chi. Similarly, describing thephysiology of the relaxation response may be less effective than having students experience it directlythrough a meditation exercise.Inclusion of traditional systems of medicine and other complementary approaches in themedical school curriculum requires both a synthesis of additional facts and a need for experience-based understanding to facilitate real clinical awareness. As with other aspects of a \"multiculturalapproach\" to medical education, immersion and other experience-based teaching methods can beinvaluable to facilitate an understanding of the differences between \"conventional\" and\"unconventional\" views of health and illness and how they can be reconciled. The experientialcomponent adds a rich contextual learning base that augments the acquisition of facts related to theseunfamiliar therapies. Furthermore, immersion adds empathetic awareness in the student that will beutilized in the future when recommendations may be made.Experiential learning also enables medical students to develop skills in self-reflection andstrategies for self-care. A central tenet of integrative medicine is the notion that self-care for thephysician, and the cultivation of a practice of reflection, are critical to the effective practice ofmedicine. The 1998 American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) learning objectives suggest:\"physicians must be compassionate and empathetic in caring for their patients ... [and] have honestyand integrity in all interactions with patients' families, colleagues and with others whom they mustinteract in their personal lives.\" 10 Implicit in this objective, it would seem, is that physicians shouldvalue and cultivate these attributes in themselves and engage in life-supporting activities that willfoster their own health so as to serve as effective role models for their patients. But the nature ofconventional medical training and professional life often do not support this practice. Therefore, manyIntroduction to Integrative Medicine Curriculum Guide CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 14medical schools have already recognized the need to add formal education in self-care and reflectionto their curriculum.Examples in the curriculum guide that devote time to deepening meaning from studentexperience include the many reflection exercises throughout the University of Minnesota Spiritualityunit, the UCSF \"Healer's Art\" course, and the Mind-Body experience provided by GeorgetownUniversity School of Medicine, which provides students with experience and a planning process fortheir own self-healing process. In addition to these units that specifically address reflection and self-awareness, we have provided in this guide suggested reflection questions for each illustrated unit.Promoting reflection in the medical school curriculum in general is an important and current goal formany medical educators. We hope that the demonstration here of how reflection questions can beprovided even for sessions (such as the Jefferson Medical College Herbal Medicine module) orientedtoward factual knowledge is helpful in illustrating how this approach can be integrated throughout acurriculum.A reliance on interactive learning is another critical part of the experience-oriented approachproposed in this guide, as demonstrated by Web-based courses (University of Minnesota Spirituality,UMDNJ overview), reviewing case studies with guided discussion exercises (Harvard case study, UTMBcases, EBM cases), and standardized patient interviewing (Temple OSCE). Such strategies\u2014as opposedto lecture format presentations\u2014provide the context and application of new learning so that thestudent is able to \"try on\" the roles of interviewer, decision-maker, and patient advocate in a newway. Clearly, lectures and PowerPoint presentations play an important role in delivering newinformation to medical students. However, in this guide we have chosen to place emphasis on activeand interactive approaches to learning which are particularly critical in mastering the competenciesproposed for integrative medicine.SummaryThe need to facilitate student understanding of CAM topics and therapies within the modernmedical environment, and the integration of new topics into the already dense medical schoolcurriculum, pose several challenges for educators. Identifying and claiming time for introducing newtopics and engaging students, so that they are able to make meaning within the learning process, isboth politically and logistically challenging. The institutional climate for incorporation of CAM andintegrative medicine will vary widely from one school to another. Some schools have been successfulin integrating topics throughout the four-year medical school curriculum at the time of plannedcurriculum reform. In other cases, educators have incorporated only selected components. Many maystill be engaged in debating whether medical education in this area is appropriate at all. Thecompetencies as well as curriculum activities presented in this guide can be adapted or customized tomeet the needs of educators and students at a given school. Our hope is that the spectrum ofapproaches presented here is wide enough to be useful in some way to educators at all points alongthe spectrum.References1 Eisenberg DM, Davis R, Ettner S, et al.

Therefore\u2014in keepingwith the recent trend in all of medical education to reaffirm and re-emphasize the humanistic valuesat the core of medicine\u2014training in integrative medicine should incorporate philosophical perspectivesin addition to a knowledge base and therapeutic skills to clearly underscore the relevance of humanexperience and interactions in health and medicine. To explicitly delineate these philosophicalperspectives, we [the CAHCIM education working group] have expanded upon the standard\"knowledge/attitudes/skills\" format for competencies that form the basis of a curriculum, to include adescription of values that we believe form the foundation for teaching in this area. These values are are-affirmation of fundamental core medical values as articulated by Hippocrates. They have also beenemphasized\u2014along with many of the competencies that address areas of communication skills andmulticultural sensitivity\u2014over the past two decades in medical education in the areas ofprofessionalism, medicine and the humanities, doctor-patient relations, and biopsychosocial training.In addition, many of these values and competencies have long been incorporated into training inother healthcare disciplines such as nursing. As these values are particularly germane to theknowledge, skills, and attitudes of integrative medicine theory and practice, they are reiterated here.We recognize that these values are timeless, whereas the content of courses is almost certainto change as science and research advances. The knowledge, skills, and attitudes sections of this guideexplore the content, relevant at this point in time, to understanding the foundations of the biomedicalparadigm, the most commonly used CAM modalities, and legal, ethical, regulatory, and politicalinfluences on the practice of integrative medicine. The competencies outlined in these sections are notmeant to serve as checklists for delineating the exact content of courses in this area\u2014which will needto be defined independently by each school\u2014but rather as general guidelines describing areas ofcontent that must be addressed to describe this area accurately to our students.The goal in elaborating values as well as knowledge, attitudes, and skills is to make explicitnot only specific behaviors, but also a way of living and being for physicians. Some would argue thatthe majority of these values are actually attitudes, and would raise the question of whether values canbe taught or rather need to be selected for. We acknowledge the challenge of assessing \"a way ofbeing.\" Perhaps its measurement may be learned from other traditions such as theological training orthrough qualitative inquiry and study of exemplary integrative medicine practitioners. Finally, weacknowledge that these competencies may be adapted and or modified in a variety of ways to fit theparticular needs and culture of individual schools.ValuesA graduating physician shall demonstrate an understanding of the following:1.

The Introduction to Complementary and Alternative Medicine unit within this courseis comprised of three parts. To initiate the unit, students receive a syllabus with bibliography, andthe course director presents a one-hour lecture with PowerPoint slides (included) that providesdefinitions and a brief overview of the use of CAM modalities in the United States, and a briefdescription and research findings on effectiveness of a sample of modalities. Topics includehomeopathy, body-based systems of acupuncture and massage therapy, mind-body medicineincluding meditation and Therapeutic Touch, herbal medicine, nutritional approaches,pharmacological therapies, and bioelectromagnetics.Students are assigned in pairs to a CAM specialty and field visit site. The purpose of the twoto four hour site visit is to hear an overview of the modality from the practitioner, and to observe theCAM provider during a patient visit and/or to experience the modality and, in turn, observe thetreatment on the other student. Students are assigned to read a set of modality specific readings priorto the site visit, including both descriptive and evidenced-based articles. The syllabus includes a listof discussion questions that guide the observation and stimulate questions to be answered by the CAMprovider during the visit. Students are sent in pairs so as not to overburden the CAM provider, tobuild on shared experiences for later reflection exercises, and to permit greater opportunities toobserve as the provider simulates a treatment with the other student.The third component of this unit is a discussion group that meets a week after theintroductory presentation. Each group is comprised of 12 students and two facilitators. Care is takento assign students within the group to a cross-section of CAM modalities and locations so that thediscussion of experiences will cover a wide range of practitioners. Students are asked to bring notesfrom their field visit and to share impressions of the visit. A CAM provider is paired with each medicalfaculty small group leader to facilitate the small group discussion. CAM providers serve as smallgroup leaders so that they can interpret student experiences and provide a broad experientialbackground to observed alternative therapies. Medical faculty and CAM facilitators meet prior to thediscussion session to review goals and discuss the approach to conducting the small group session.Students take turns describing their experiences, then work through the discussion questions.Sample Discussion questions: (Full list included with materials)What was the purpose of the CAM treatment that you observed?What did you notice about the physical environment of the provider's office?What was the patient's reaction to the treatment? (If a student served as patient, what was thestudent's reaction?)What types of questions did the CAM provided ask the patient before administeringtreatment?What aspects of CAM, if any, would be important for you to know as a physician? Whatwould you incorporate into your practice?Suggested Reflection questions:What were your first thoughts as you listened to the CAM overview presentation?What were you thinking as you approached this site visit? Did you notice anything unusual?What contributed to your reactions to this CAM unit?What would you name as the most significant experience for you during this unit? What do you need to do to learn more about this topic?What will you do differently, in patient interviews or symptom review, after learning aboutpatients' use of alternative healing modalities?University of Michigan CAM Overview/CAM Field Experience CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 25Resource materials:Warber S.

Toevaluate learning, students complete a complete a CAM Knowledge and Attitude Survey that isadministered at the beginning of each academic year by the CAM program administrator andadministered again at the beginning of the each academic year. Planned evaluation strategies includeinclusion of CAM standard patient experiences, incorporating patient use of CAM modalities that willbe conducted in the second and at the end of the third year.Student evaluations of curriculum session: All students complete two evaluations at the end of the final session of this unit, one for thefield visit (included) and a ten-item evaluation of the CAM unit overall. The unit is also included as aseparate item in the medical school's course evaluation that is completed by a cohort of students atthe end of the course. Over the past four years, students have given the experience very high ratings,and this unit has been one of the most highly rated units within the course. Student comments haveguided the course director in revising the list of CAM providers who participate as field visit sites andas small group leaders, and have informed providers on ways to make the experience more valuable.Over 85% of the students report that this unit has stimulated their desire to learn about CAM and thatthey find this course to be valuable.Challenges to presenting this unit:Assignment and coordination of 170 student placements begins approximately two monthsprior to the CAM unit. To recruit the approximately 65-70 CAM providers who participate in the fieldvisits, letters are sent to CAM providers that describe the goals of the field experience and dates of theproposed field visits. Selection of CAM providers and facilitators is based on personal knowledge ofthe providers, years of practitioner's experience, community reputation, and experience with teachingand community and/or university presentations. Confirmation of participation is made by a follow-up phone call. Care is taken to recruit practitioners representing a variety of CAM modalities.Challenges to this unit's success are many, including attempting to recruit practitioners, someof whom may not be well known to the coordinators, attempts to include providers whose part-timepractice hours did not match medical school assigned visit schedules, inability to provide CAMprovider preceptor training prior to the students' visit and inability to provide stipends to CAM fieldvisit providers for the time devoted to medical student education. Recruitment of CAM co-facilitatorsis less challenging, as fewer are needed.

The field of CAM encompasses a wide variety of modalities and practices and isprovided by an array of different health professionals trained in one or several practices of CAM.The National Institute of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), a division of theNational Institute of Health (NIH) groups CAM into five major domains.I. Alternative medical systems Alternative medical systems involve complete systems of theory and practice that have evolvedindependent of and often prior to the conventional biomedical approach. Many are traditionalsystems of medicine that are practiced by individual cultures throughout the world. Includedwithin this domain of CAM are a number of Asian approaches, such as traditional orientalmedicine or ayurveda and western approaches, such as homeopathy, anthroposophic medicineand naturopathy.II. Mind-body interventions Mind-body interventions encompass a variety of techniques designed to facilitate the mind'scapacity to affect bodily function and symptoms, such as, meditation, hypnosis, dance, music, andart therapy, and prayer and spiritual healing.III. Biologically-based interventions This category of CAM includes natural and biologically-based practices, interventions, andproducts, many of which overlap with conventional medicine's use of dietary supplements.Included within this domain are herbal medicine and special dietary, orthomolecular, andindividual biological therapies..IV. Manipulative and Body-Based Interventions This category includes methods that are based on manipulation and/or movement of the body,and/or tissues, such as chiropractic care, massage therapies and acupuncture/pressure.V. Energy Therapies Energy therapies focus on re-aligning the energy fields posited to originate from within thebody (biofields) or other sources (electromagnetic fields) to promote healing. The practicesinclude, for example, Therapeutic Touch, Reiki, as well as biomagnetics.As you can see, each CAM domain covers a host of different systems and treatment modalities. Youwill have the opportunity to experience/observe one of the practices or systems of medicine coveredby these broad categories through a field visit. During your field visit, some of the CAM providerswill simulate an experience with you as if you were coming to see them for the first time. Others willallow you to observe their practice with clients/ patients. As with your other field experiences, pleasebe prompt in arriving at your specific location, respectful in asking questions of the providers, andfollow the specific directives given to you before and at the time of the visit.University of Michigan CAM Overview/CAM Field Experience CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 28In your packet, you will find a few general articles on CAM. In addition, to further your knowledgebase, you will find a list of resources on CAM as well as a specific reading list related to the variousmodalities. Articles from the reading list can be obtained from the ITTP office.Prior to your field visit, read the four general articles on CAM. Once your field visit is assigned, youshould obtain copies of readings related to the specific modality or alternative system of medicine thatyou will be observing. Information in these articles will greatly enhance your understanding of theCAM practices you will be observing/experiencing and enable you to ask more informed questions ofthe provider. A list of the CAM providers and their primary modality of practice will be madeavailable.The four general articles on CAM offer different pieces of information. It will be helpful to you if youread them in the following sequence. Read the article by Warber first. This article provides anoverview of CAM and brief description of the major modalities. Read the article by Astin next. In thisarticle, Astin presents evidence on the various reasons why patients are pursuing CAM. The 1998article by Eisenberg provides information of the prevalence, cost and usage of CAM in the pastdecade. This article documents trends in alternative medicine and is a follow-up to his seminal studyin 1993 that first highlighted CAM usage to the medical community. The fourth article you shouldread is the 1995 article by Eisenberg. In this article, he discusses ways in which to advise patients onCAM.Before you go on your field visit, familiarize yourself with the discussion questions listed on thefollowing page. These questions will help you hone your observation skills. After your field visit, jotdown notes of your experiences in response to these questions. Reflecting on your experienceimmediately after through writing will allow you to capture salient thoughts and feelings and bringthem back more easily during the discussion. Read your notes prior to the small group discussionsection, as this will enrich the quality of the discussion.Please complete the evaluation form after the field visit. The information you provide on theevaluation form provides valuable feedback to the future design of this unit.Bring both your notes and field visit evaluation form to the small group discussion section. The formswill be collected at that time.University of Michigan CAM Overview/CAM Field Experience CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 29MODALITY-SPECIFIC READINGS FOR FIELD VISITSALTERNATIVE MEDICAL SYSTEMSHomeopathyCastro M.

A journal review and mid-termproject make up the two additional units for a total of 15. This Web-based multidisciplinary seminaris described as providing students with a working knowledge of complementary and alternativemedicine (CAM) and clinical applications for patient/client care and research. The home Web page displays links to the honor code agreement, and a pretest, both of whichmust be completed before any lessons are initiated. Lessons appear over the series of weeks, sostudents are guided through the sequence of topics that are addressed in the seminar course. Manylessons include an audiotape of lecture material, which may be played in segments in concert with theparaphrased text on each Web page. Requirements include participation in threaded discussions onweekly topics to demonstrate learning through lectures and readings, completion of case scenarioswith descriptive action plans, completion of a CAM practitioner interview and critically reporting onthe experience, preparation of a journal review on a related topic, and completion of a multiple-choiceposttest. Students may send an email to the course or session director at any time to gainclarification or approval of a selected project topic. Guest faculty who are content specialists forselected units are available only during the week they are scheduled on the master course schedule.Students are required to have regular access to appropriate hardware and software, specified clearlywithin the first pages of the course introduction.Discussion questions (see additional questions in attached sample lesson):1. Suppose that a CAM treatment has a significant placebo effect, but the actual effect of thetreatment is minimal or doubtful. Let's also assume that not much else is available to treat theUMDNJ Web-based CAM Overview/Legal Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 57patient's condition.

Boozang, Western Medicine opens thedoor to alternative medicine, XXIV Am J. L. Med. 201-212 (1998)Evaluation Strategies for the Seminar course:Performance is assessed for both knowledge and hypothetical clinical application skills.Knowledge will be evaluated based on a pre- and posttest. Test questions address topics covered in thecourse including basic principles of CAM, cultural and legal issues, risks and benefits, and specifictherapies addressed in the course. Clinical evaluation strategies are based on case scenarios. Withinthe presented scenarios, students design interview questions for patients and describe how they wouldrespond to and guide patients regarding therapies used in the case scenarios. The pre- and postknowledge test and clinical evaluation piece will be conducted on-line with students.To receive credit for this course, students complete a mid-term project (20%) that includesboth analysis of two case scenarios and a written report describing a CAM practitioner interview. Theyare evaluated on a journal review (25%) on a topic related to the practitioner interview and on theirparticipation in the threaded Web discussions for each lesson. The posttest is evaluated for theremaining 20% of the course grade. A noncredit option is available, with an expectation that thesestudents attend all content sessions, and participate in bulletin board discussions in a minimum of 7of the 13 sessions. Noncredit elective students are exempt from the midterm project and journalreview.UMDNJ Web-based CAM Overview/Legal Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 59UNIVERSITY OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY OF NEW JERSEYCOMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE SEMINAR (PCAR 7115)FALL 2003Weekly schedule of lecture topics and assignment due datesCourse ContentWeekOther pertinentinformationSession 1Overview of Complementary and Alternative MedicineLecturer: Adam Perlman, MD, MPH9/4-9/10Session 2Botanicals, Ergogenic aids, Women's Rigassio Radler MS, RD9/11-9/17Session 3Legal and Ethical Lecturer: Kathleen Boozang JD, LLM9/18-9/24Manuscript topicdueSession 4Scientifically statisticalsignificanceGuest Lecturer: Riva Touger-Decker, PhD, RD, FADA9/25-10/1Session 5Evaluating uses and limitations of CAM in illness and wellness:Applying the evaluation processGuest Lecturers: Judith Deutsch, PhD, PT and Ellen Anderson, MA, PT10/2-10/8Manuscript outlinedueSession 6Qi Gong: Introduction, history, current applications - Kevin Chen, PhDAcupuncture: Introduction, history, current applications - Ala Malko10/9-10/15Session 7Midterm projects (Journal review and Interview)10/16-10/22Student posting anddiscussionSession Lecturer: Maureen Huhmann, MS, RD11/13-11/19Draft manuscriptdueSession 12Patient management and integration of CAM Perlman, MD, Post-test12/11-12/17StudentpresentationsUMDNJ Web-based CAM Overview/Legal Module CAHCIM Guide Integrative Medicine 60LEGAL ISSUESSample Module: Legal IssuesThe following text appears in short segments on consecutive Web pages.

About the TeacherLet's begin by giving you a chance to get to know a little bit about who I am. For the past[number] years, I have been a law professor and the director of the Health Law Program at [named]University School of Law. We offer a law degree, of course, as well as a special one year degreeprogram in health law for health professionals, called an MSJ.I teach a variety of health law courses that are mostly business related. I have particularinterest in end-of-life care and alternative medicine, and I have written two articles on CAM issues.One addresses the question of whether and when it is appropriate, from a legal and ethicalperspective, to integrate CAM with conventional or Western medicine. The other article asks whetherand when managed care should cover CAM. I am currently working on an article that exploreswhether healthcare professionals may or should use placebos for therapeutic purposes.I am attracted to thinking about alternative modalities because it forces us to rethink many ofour conceptions about health care and medicine, the adequacy of Western allopathic medicine,medical research, how we decide what kind of care is appropriate, physicians' relationships with othercaregivers, what kind of health care public and private insurance should cover, bioethics, and the lawand healthcare, including informed consent and malpractice.II. GoalsWe cannot possibly consider the myriad issues evoked by CAM. I thought it would be useful for us tofocus on the question of when it is appropriate to offer CAM.\u0000I have chosen two issues for consideration in this class:1. What legal and ethical questions arise in which physicians and nurses seek to integrate CAM intheir care of patients?This discussion applies to situations when conventional providers themselves offer CAM therapies andwhen they refer their patients to, or seek to coordinate care, with CAM providers.2. How might malpractice rules apply to unproven CAM therapies?Note about terminology:It is more difficult to efficiently address language choices in this context. Consequently, Ihave decided to choose certain terms that are under-inclusive. A number of terms are used todistinguish between conventional/Western medicine and alternative, complementary, integrativemedicine. For ease of reference, I am going to use the terms conventional medicine and CAM.Innumerable kinds of providers are involved in the provision of healthcare, whether it beconventional or CAM. Physician, nurses, advanced nurse practitioners, physician assistants, therapists,etc. are considered to be part of the school that provides \"conventional medicine,\" even though theyrely upon differing philosophies in the care they provide and may be very open to CAM. The differentkinds of CAM providers are impossible to enumerate. For ease of reference, I am going to use theterms conventional provider and CAM provider, even though these references do not accurately reflectwhat goes on in the real world.UMDNJ Web-based CAM Overview/Legal Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 61Note to students: You will need to download the following two files for this session.Click on two reference files (names appear) to download to your computer.III. Integration of CAM and Conventional Treatment: Ethical and Legal ConsiderationsMost people use alternative therapies without involving or even telling their Conventionalproviders, which has its own serious implications. Increasingly, however, conventional providers aremore aware of, or desire to participate in their patients' use of a variety of treatment modalities. Mostoften, the patient initiates the discussion about integrating conventional treatments with CAM.In these situations, the patient tells her Conventional provider that she wants to combine hermedical treatment with alternatives she has discovered on her own, or is receiving from an alternativetherapist. In these cases, the conventional provider must decide whether he or she is willing to \"goalong with\" the patient's decision to combine CAM and conventional therapies. The conventionalprovider might be enthusiastic or negative. In either case, the provider must consider whetheracceding to the patient's wishes is ethically and legally appropriate.With increasing frequency, conventional providers are asking themselves whether CAMtherapies are becoming so popular that they should add them to their practices. A number ofmotivations may exist here. Motivation matters. Some CAM therapies are being proven to be effective, and conventional providers shouldoffer them to patients whom they believe will be helped. Other CAM therapies that have notbeen subject to clinical trials appear from pervasive use to be helpful to patients. Many CAMtherapies are the subject of current research; some have already been proven not to work. Some Conventional providers treat patients who employ alternative treatments that they haveadopted from their religion or culture. These providers want to gain their patients' trust andto respect their beliefs, to the extent possible. Some CAM therapies offer conventional providers an opportunity to increase revenue,especially if the therapies involve products that the conventional provider can sell.It is safe to assume that there is nothing particularly controversial about a conventional provider'sadoption of a CAM therapy that has been proven to work. The questions become much more difficultwhen it is unclear whether the treatment works, or no evidence exists to suggest that the treatment isefficacious. This is especially true if the Conventional provider plans to charge for the treatment, or tosell \"therapeutic products.\"\u0000Please download the PDF file and read the following excerpt from Kathleen M. Boozang so that we canfurther discuss these issues.Kathleen M. Boozang., Western Medicine Opens the Door to Alternative Medicine, XXIV Am J. L.Med,1998; 201-212Questions for post-reading discussion (Respond on the bulletin board):1. Suppose that a CAM treatment has a significant placebo effect, but the actual effect of thetreatment is minimal or doubtful. Let's also assume that not much else is available to treat thepatient's condition. Is \"placebo effect\" a sufficient reason for a Conventional provider to offer atherapy to a patient?2. Some CAM proponents argue that clinical trials are designed according to the philosophy andvalues of Western medicine and that CAM treatments should not be required to be subjected toclinical trials as currently designed. How do you respond?Providers must obtain a patient's informed consent to treatment. This requires the provider to advisethe patient of his or her diagnosis prognosis alternative treatments, including the option of nontreatment the risks and benefits of the proposed treatmentFor purposes of this discussion, the issue is: what qualifies as an appropriate treatment to offer apatient? Most of us assume that the treatment is efficacious.3. If the conventional provider believes that it is completely unclear or even doubtful whether a CAMUMDNJ Web-based CAM Overview/Legal Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 62therapy is efficacious, should the conventional provider agree to provide it to her patient?A) Why?B) If the provider does offer it, what should he or she tell the patient about the treatment?IV. Can a conventional provider be liable for negligence if he or she accedes to a patient's demandfor a CAM therapy that proves harmful?A CAM therapy might itself cause harm to a patient, either by itself, or because it interactsadversely with a conventional therapy. When the patient is seriously ill, a conventional provider maybe particularly concerned if the patient desires to employ a CAM therapy of uncertain or doubtfulefficacy in lieu of a conventional treatment that offers a great chance of benefit to the patient. Thestandard for negligence in a medical malpractice claim is \"whether the treatment deviates fromaccepted medical standards.\"This test presents an obvious problem to those who desire to employ CAM therapies that arenot mainstream alternatives\u2014it appears that such practitioners would automatically be engaging innegligent behavior. If this deviation from standard medical practice is the cause of harm to thepatient, the provider would be liable for malpractice.The question becomes whether a practitioner of CAM therapies can protect himself or herselffrom legal liability by explaining to the patient that the treatment is not proven, that the patient maysuffer harm either from the treatment or because the patient is foregoing a more reliable alternative,and obtaining the patient's consent to the CAM treatment. In short, can a provider who offers a CAMtherapy to her patient protect himself or herself from a malpractice claim by arguing that the patienthas \"assumed the risk of using the treatment\"? The answer to this question is unclear, but New York isone of the few states that has addressed the question.Please download the PDF file and read the excerpts from the trial and appellate court decisions inCharell v. Gonzalez.Consider the following, then respond to the discussion questions on the bulletin board:Did the jury find that the defendant had engaged in negligent behavior?Did the jury find that the defendant had provided the plaintiff with sufficient information about thetreatment he was offering?Did the jury feel that the plaintiff had any responsibility for the harms she suffered?Questions for bulletin board discussions:In your opinion, should Charell have been liable for the care he provided?Charell represents only one case in one state. As the law develops in this area, what should the lawbe?Should providers ever be liable for providing unproven CAM treatments to patients (assuming thepatients are harmed as a result)?If a patient is completely informed about the treatment and consents to receive it, should such consentprotect the provider from liability?Temple Interview Skills: Standardized Patient CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum 63INTERVIEW SKILLS:STANDARDIZED PATIENT EXPERIENCE_______________________________________MODULE DESCRIPTIONUnit Contributed byMichael CurtisDavid Barclay, MD Standardized Patient Program Temple University School of Medicine Philadelphia, PAIntegrative Medicine competencies addressed: (see Section 3Skills 3Goals and ObjectivesThe goal of this workshop is to build skills needed in a therapeutic doctor-patientrelationship, recognizing the prevalence of nontraditional medicine among patients.Identify perceived differences between traditional \"allopathic\" medicine and CAM\"nontraditional\" medicine.Utilize questions to discover the case challenges through the therapeutic interview process.Evaluate patients' reasons for seeking nontraditional medicine.Evaluate limitations to Western allopathic medicine.Determine methods of responding to your questions and patients' questions about CAM.Practice interviewing and observe other students interviewing skills.Curriculum component:RequiredTarget audience:M2 studentsDuration: One two-hour workshop,(Component of the second year Fundamentals of Clinical Care course)Learning Methods employed: Small group discussion Experiential learningFaculty resources: 1 medical school faculty for 8 students 1 Standardized PatientTemple Interview Skills: Standardized Patient CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 64Description:Students in the second-year course \"Fundamentals of Clinical Care\" participate in eight two-hour interviewing workshops, each of these linked to a preliminary didactic session addressingspecific psychosocial issues in patient care. Prior to this session, a presentation is provided oncomplementary and alternative medicine. Students are assigned to an eight-member small group withone faculty preceptor. Faculty members complete a preparation course prior to serving as preceptor,and prior to each case workshop, they receive instructions and objectives for the case. The theme ofthis workshop is to provide students with an opportunity to interview a patient who places muchgreater confidence in complementary and alternative medicine than in mainstream \"allopathic\"medicine. In keeping with the workshop's objective that students are to discover the challenge throughthe therapeutic interview process, preceptors are told not to discuss the theme of the case prior to thepatient interview.After an orientation to the session, the \"standard\" patient joins the group. Two students areselected to conduct the interview. Students follow a checklist of topics, with the first student initiatingthe interview with the rapport-building and family and social history, and the other student followingwith review of systems and more specific questions. Students practice active listening and use ofopen-ended questions and follow-up on patient comments leading toward the underlying concern.The preceptor or the interviewer or the other observing students may call for a \"time out\" in theprocess to discuss a response or determine a change in approach. (See further description of thesession in the \"Format of the workshops\" in included materials.)After the interview, students discuss the obstacles to building a therapeutic relationship withthis patient. An observing student completes the interview assessment form (provided at the end ofthe case). The preceptor emphasizes teaching points that are provided in the preceptor guide, discussesthe observed interviewing process, and provides feedback to the two students who served asinterviewers. The assessment form is reviewed at this time. All students in the group write up thepatient history to be submitted to the preceptor for review and comments.Suggested Discussion questions:In what ways did the patient's view of traditional medicine change over time?What was the patient seeking through nontraditional providers and treatments? What are thebeliefs that are guiding her actions?What approach and questions were successful in bringing out the patient's concerns? Whatother questions could aid this process?How do you define \"therapeutic interview\"? What components of the interview make theencounter a therapeutic relationship?Suggested Reflection questions:What was your reaction to the first glimpse of the patient's distrust of allopathic medicine?What reaction did you see in other students in the group?What contributed to your reaction?What does this case reveal about traditional allopathic care?What do your beliefs do to create healing? What do your behaviors do to create healing?What questions remain after considering the aspects of this case?What concept or approach was most useful to you?What growth is needed? What learning do you plan to do?What do you want to remember from this event that you will carry into the next situation?Resource materials (students may be given these after the session):Astin JA.

The issue of menopause is used as a context for the encounter.Teaching pointsThe following points were made in Dr. Kris Parris' lecture on Complementary and AlternativeMedicine to the FCC-2 students:1) Embrace it if it is an integral part of your patients' lives.2) Understand why patients turn to CAM and see the limitations of traditionalWestern medicine.3) Understand the different modalities that are being used.4) Separate the facts from fiction in the science behind CAM.5) Put it all together: how to answer questions about CAMfor both you and your patients.Perceived differences between surgical information neededNo surgical optionWhy patients use CAM Seeking health promotion and disease prevention Conventional therapies have been exhausted Conventional therapies of unclear benefit Conventional therapies with side effects Media influenceCommon beliefs about CAM \"Not really medicine\" No side effects Monitoring of CAM not requiredSuggested resourceAltmed.comTemple Interview Skills: Standardized Patient CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 68Presenting Issue (Information for the student before meeting the patient):Mrs. Elaine Harper is a 53-year old woman who has come to the Family Practice because herhealth insurance provider requires her to see a physician for a regular check-up.Instructions to Standardized Patient (SP):1. Patient Intention:Mrs. Harper has come to the doctor because her health insurance provider requires that shehave a check-up once every three years, and she is now due for one. She is not happy about having tosee a physician, and simply wants to assure the doctor that she is feeling very well and has no need ofany medical care,. She would like the physician to agree that she is healthy. She does not expect toconvert the doctor to alternative medical practices but if the opportunity presents itself she will makeit clear that she no longer has much confidence in mainstream medicine.2. Patient Manner:Mrs. Harper is very polite and speaks confidently with the doctor but is not very warmtowards the interviewer at first. She gives the impression of being a bit suspicious, waiting for thedoctor to reveal her or his attitudes towards her health practices. She speaks enthusiastically about heralternative medical practices but should not appear eccentric in any way. If an interviewer shoulddenigrate her alternative health practices, she will politely, but firmly, defend her beliefs. Note thatshe will not, under any circumstances, direct any criticism towards the interviewer personally, butrather towards the \"mainstream medical system.\"SPs should note the material in quotation marks and try to use it verbatim when possible andas a guide to the patient's general manner of speaking.3. Patient History:SP's should note that the case is written for a patient 53 years old. SP's should portray apatient as close to that age as is reasonable for them. If necessary adjust the age and aspects of thehistory to accommodate the age of the patient they are playing. Please advise the preceptor ahead oftime about the age of the patient.History of Present IllnessMrs. Harper has no complaint for which she is seeking treatment at this time. In the last yearshe has been experiencing menopause but will say that she does not see that as an illness, and\"anyway, I'm dealing with it strictly through natural means.\" She has not seen a physician regardingher menopause or regarding her use of various substances to deal with it.History of MenopauseMrs. Harper started to experience menopause about a year ago. Her menstrual bleedingstarted fluctuating wildly in terms of regularity\u2014sometimes coming on several times in a month, othertimes being absent entirely\u2014and in heaviness of flow. Over that time, she has noticed episodes ofprofuse sweating, and sudden hot flashes that sometimes wake her up at night. She feels them asintense heat over her trunk and face, with flushing of the skin and heavy sweating. They last only afew minutes but can be very severe. \"It's this wave that just takes over you, and you've got to pretendit isn't happening. Sometimes I just feel like falling to the floor.\" They can occur at any time but aremore pronounced late in the day, in hot weather, after having hot food or hot drinks, or if she isfeeling tense. They have been happening a little more frequently lately, sometimes several times a day,but not quite every day. If she has them at night, she feels very sweaty and uncomfortable and cannotsleep. She has had a few episodes of heart palpitations, the first such incident about four or fivemonths ago, the most recent a few weeks ago. She will say that she was having problems with moodswings at first, but that they seem to have passed now. She has had some problems with tenderness inher breasts and vaginal dryness.If asked, she plays down all symptoms of menopause, saying that she has had them, ofcourse, but that they are \"nothing to worry about, everything is well under control, it's totally normalof course.\" They have not changed significantly in some months.Temple Interview Skills: Standardized Patient CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 69To deal with the menopause, she has been following a variety of naturopathic treatments. Shehas absolutely rejected any suggestion of conventional hormonal replacement therapy, stating that ithas been shown to be very dangerous, increasing the likelihood of cancer and heart problems. She willlink this to anecdotes about women she knows who have been on HRT and are having serious healthproblems.Current health practicesShe last saw a primary care physician for a check-up a few years ago. At that time she hadnot yet experienced any signs of menopause, but her doctor \"warned\" her to expect it soon, and\"made it sound like some sort of disease.\"Since the menopausal symptoms first appeared, she has been taking an herb, in a condensedtablet form, called black cohosh. She understands this to be a traditional herb long used by women inGermany. It is supposed to reduce the hot flashes and sweating.She has been using a Chinese root called dong quai. It, too, is supposed to reduce hot flushesand night sweats. She has been using it for about six months. (She might add that she is interested inTraditional Chinese Medicine\u2014likes the idea of an ancient philosophy behind it\u2014but does not know alot about it. She thinks she might try some other traditional Chinese substances.)She has been using evening primrose oil, \"just started that recently\", which is to reducesweating. \"It's a very powerful female oil, and works with the female energies.\"She has been taking red clover, which she says prevents heart palpitations, for a few months.She has been using St. John's wort for about a year. She says it is used to reduce moodswings and reduce the nervousness that sometimes accompanies menopause.She has been using motherwort for the past year, to reduce vaginal dryness, and thinks \"it isstarting to work with my female energies.\"She drinks ginseng tea to improve her energy.She drinks Earl Grey tea if she has a headache.She is taking calcium supplements to avoid osteoporosis.She has tried a variety of homeopathic remedies, in liquid form, as well for all of the variousproblems, settling on \"a couple of them. I don't recall what they are right now, herbal extracts thathave been diluted so that you get only the real essence, the real vital force of the plant, no impuritiesat all.\"She is considering having regular shiatsu massage and acupuncture treatment to preventarthritis.She tends to follow the recommendations of the herbalist she goes to and has also beenresearching natural remedies on the Internet. All of the substances noted above are taken orally.If asked about other naturopathic health practices, she will say she finds them quiteinteresting, and is considering aromatherapy for stress reduction. The exception is ear-candling, whichshe thinks is \"weird.\"Note to SPs: Naturopathic practitioners sometimes ask questions of the patient that can seemquite irrelevant, such as whether the patient likes hot or cold rooms, what music they like, etc. Somestudents may find the topic of interest and may pursue such questioning. Be prepared to answer anysuch questions using your own inclination. The patient may recognize the technique and will beenthusiastic about it.Temple Interview Skills: Standardized Patient CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 70Past Medical History Mrs. Harper recalls being told she had ear infections as an infant, but remembers no details.She also recalls \"being a very sickly child.\" She does not recall the details but knows she was out ofschool for weeks on end several times.As a teenager, she remembers having the flu a lot, and mononucleosis once, with sore throatand high fever. She was told the only treatment was rest, and she had to stay home for a couple ofweeks.As an adult, she has had urinary tract infections several times, causing painful and frequenturination. She has also had skin rashes on a number of occasions.She had used birth control pills for a few years after the birth of her last child but stoppedwhen her husband had a vasectomy.Mrs. Harper will say that, \"every time something went wrong the doctors would just give memore pills. And they never really seemed to work. I guess finally I just realized that it was all thewrong way to go about it; it just wasn't natural. It was coming to menopause that did it. I realizedthat you have to work with your body's energies. It's more of an Oriental approach. And that's beenmarvelous for me.\" If asked further about her negativity toward mainstream medicine she will say, \"itwas the C-section business that got me really annoyed with regular medicine.\" She had her first childby vaginal delivery and all went well, and she looked forward to the same with further children. Butwhile in labor with her second child \"something went wrong. I don't know what and they never reallyexplained it properly to me. The next thing I knew I had been under anesthetic and they had done aC-section. Well, okay, if it was really needed fine, but when I got pregnant with my third they told mebecause I'd had one C-section I couldn't go back to natural childbirth. And they just wouldn't evendiscuss it. I got really annoyed.\"Family HistoryFather died at age 66 of heart disease. He had been hypertensive and obese.Mother died at age 72, following a stroke. She had developed diabetes as an adult, andosteoporosis and arthritis in her later years.Mrs. Harper has a brother, two years older, who is being treated for heart disease, and onesister, a year younger. Her sister \"always seemed to be sick when she was a kid\" (the patient cannotprovide details) and developed diabetes some years ago. She is now on medication and insulin. WhileMrs. Harper gets along well with her sister, the two of them disagree about medicine. \"She just followswhatever the doctor tells her, and she ends up having to take all sorts of pills. We just don't talk aboutit anymore; there's no point.\"Mrs. Harper does not know much about the health histories of her grandparents, except forher mother's mother, who died of breast cancer in her 60s.She does not know the menopausal history of any of her female relatives.Social HistoryMrs. Harper edits ArtsNow, a magazine about activities in the arts in the Delaware Valley.She enjoys her job, finding it stimulating talking with people about music, art, dance, theater,literature, etc. She is active evenings and weekends, going to arts events.She has been happily married for 27 years. Her husband is a real estate lawyer. They arefinancially comfortable. They have three grown children. (SP can elaborate on this as suitable andnecessary.)Temple Interview Skills: Standardized Patient CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 71If asked about sexual activity, Mrs. Harper will admit that she has not been as comfortablewith it lately. She has some vaginal dryness and discomfort during coitus, but expects that will goaway.Habits HistoryMrs. Harper will say she follows a healthy diet and eats well. She has become interested infollowing a vegetarian diet and is gradually stopping eating meat and eating more soy products. Shewill say she heard that soy was \"much better for women's bones than meat.\" She has reduced the levelof fat in her diet and is trying to consume more fresh vegetables and fruit. She has reduced her coffeeto one cup per day (\"wonder if I should cut that out too; coffee is a male plant.\") She has neversmoked and never used illicit drugs. She drinks alcohol only rarely now, on social occasions; \"I don'tknow that it's all that natural.\"Her husband used to smoke, but quit about 15 years ago. \"I convinced him that the second-hand smoke wasn't good for me or the children.\" They do not permit smoking in their home.She does not follow an exercise program and will sheepishly admit that she \"should, ofcourse, as part of a natural program of health, but I'm so busy with work it's hard to fit it in.\"She does regular breast self-examinations and sees a gynecologist every two years for apelvic exam.MedicationsNote that Mrs. Harper does not think of her homeopathic and herbal treatments as\"medicine.\" But she knows what the doctor is \"getting at,\" and if she is asked what medications shetakes she will say \"I don't use any medications of the sort that you would prescribe.\" If asked whatshe means by that she will say she is using only natural products. She will, however, readily, evenenthusiastically, explain about all of them. Black cohosh Dong quai (\"dong k-why\") Evening primrose oil Red clover St. John's wort Motherwort Ginseng tea Earl Grey tea Various homeopathic remedies Calcium supplementsShe labels all the plant products as \"female plants and herbs. You have to match the plants tothe person and the need. There are male plants and female plants and herbs, and women should takeonly female ones for female needs.\" She will explain that the natural substances she is taking \"workwith the body, not against it like Western synthetic medicines.\" She is not clear on the strength of anyof the substances, saying only that she takes them \"every day, one tablet or whatever, asrecommended.\" If asked if she worries about interactions amongst the various substances or possibleside effects, she will say \"no, there's no worry; they're all natural products.\"Review of Symptoms Mrs. Harper will say she is \"feeling in excellent health\" and will talk about these varioussymptoms only if asked specifically about them.For the last six months she has been losing weight, but she is actually quite pleased with this,though it had not been her intention. She has lost approximately 15 pounds, most of it in the lastcouple of months. (SPs may alter depending upon their own build.)Temple Interview Skills: Standardized Patient CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 72She has noticed for a few months that she is urinating more often, but attributes this to\"better functioning, I'm flushing away the impurities\" and that she is drinking more fluid. She findsshe is now urinating nine or ten times a day.She feels thirsty more often in the past few months, and is indeed drinking more water, six orseven glasses a day, but shrugs this off, saying she \"should be drinking more, it's just my body tellingme it needs the basic fluid of life. I've heard you should drink eight glasses a day anyways.\"She has noticed a few episodes of heart palpitations but tends to think of those as related tomenopause, \"and it's only happened a few times, well under control; I've heard of it far worse infriends who are using estrogen.\" The first such incident was about four or five months ago, the mostrecent a few weeks ago.Twice in the last year she has had vaginal yeast infections, which she has treated withdouches.She has had a few headaches in the last few weeks but shrugs this off as just pressure ofwork. They are not in any one specific area of her head and tend to last only an hour or so. Shedrinks tea when she gets a headache, \"I'm not going to take Tylenol or anything like that; there's oilof bergamot in Earl Grey tea. That's supposed to be good for headaches, and it seems to be working.\"She has been feeling a little more tired than usual lately but attributes this to working harderlately. \"There's so many problems with arts funding, and we're trying to cover it all in the magazine.\"Time LineTimeEventAs a childEar infections, several adultFrequent urinary years child born, normal delivery24 years agoSecond child born, C-section due to unknown emergency22 years agoThird child born, C-section, much to her agoHusband smoking3 check-up, doctor \"warned\" her about menopause1 year agoFirst signs of menopause, started trying various herbal and homeopathicsubstances1 year agoStarted taking St. Johns' wort, motherwort, ginseng tea1 year agoStarted taking black cohoshWithin last yearTwo episodes of yeast infections6 months agoStarted using dong quai6 months agoStart of weight loss4 or 5 months agoFirst heart palpitationsA few months agoStarted using red cloverIn the last few monthsMore frequent urination, greater thirstIn the last couple ofmonthsMore rapid weight lossA few weeks agoMost recent heart weeksHeadachesJust evening primrose oilNOWTemple Interview Skills: Standardized Patient Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 734.Communication Challenge:At some time approximately five or six minutes into the interview, regardless of what elsemay have been discussed up to that point, the patient will say:\"My last doctor seemed to think menopause was some sort of disease. He acted like there wassomething wrong with me. But really, menopause is natural, and that's the way I'm looking at myhealth, as a natural thing to be dealt with through natural means.\"Depending upon how the rapport has been built between doctor and patient and what else may havebeen discussed, this may be said in a tone of suspicion (implied that she thinks this doctor agrees) orof relief (that she thinks this does doctor is not like that).Temple Interview Skills: Standardized Patient CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 74TEMPLE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINEFCC-2 Interviewing Skills Workshops with Standardized Patients(To be completed by an observing student in the workshop.)Date: (mm/dd/yyyy) _______/________/________CaseStudent Name: ___________________________________Preceptor: ___________________________________Case-Specific ItemsThese are the specific critical items the student should deal with in the interview:ItemYESNO1OOAscertains patient's signs of menopause.2OOLearns that patient has not used hormone replacement therapy and thatshe has no intention of doing so.3OODoes not insist upon patient starting HRT.4OOObtains complete list of herbal substances being used by patient.5OODoes not behave in a negatively judgmental way toward patientbecause she follows CAM practices.6OODetermines that St. John's wort has been used in excess of 6 weeks.7OOObtains history of palpitations.8OOObtains history of more frequent urination and greater thirst.9OOObtains history of weight loss.10OOObtains family history of diabetes and of heart disease.ProcessItemYESNOMark \"YES\" if the item was well done.1OOWas student organized in approach to obtaining history?2OODid student use open-ended questions to begin interview segments?3OODid student use language appropriate to patient's age andunderstanding?4OODid student use transition statements at least twice?5OODid the student use nonverbal communication (eye contact, bodyposition, body language) to enhance communication?6OODid student allow the patient to talk without interruption?7OOWas the patient encouraged to ask additional questions, to volunteerinformation?8OODid the student carry out a thorough social history?9OODid the student carry out a thorough family history?10Were the following aspects of closure done?10.1OOCompliment to patient for coming to see the doctor.10.2OOCompliment to patient for answering questions well.10.3OORequest to patient if anything further is to be discussed10.4OOExplanation given of what is to follow.

Cases are used throughout thelecture to illustrate the application of other approaches to treat common conditions, including fatigueand stomach upset. Students are given a chance to consider controversies and evaluate the conceptsof evidence versus proof in effectiveness. An extensive syllabus includes a list of readings, Websites,Thomas Jefferson Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 78educational goals, key terms, introductory materials on the topics provided, tables illustrating herb useand evidence base of botanical medicine. Also included in the syllabus are cultural considerations,controversies, safety considerations, study questions, and \"how to learn more: next steps\" guide ofactivities in the medical center and central campus to further develop understanding of the topic.This topic is reinforced in a session later in the year that provides an overview of CAM.Selected pharmacology slides are presented again, for review and discussion. During the fourth year,a one-month pharmacology elective course is offered, with nearly 25 percent of the fourth-year classenrolling. The botanical medicine material is reviewed and presented in more depth and complexityduring this course.Discussion questions:Recognizing the fact that botanical medicines are not regulated by the US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA), how do you obtain high quality products in the United States?What steps can be taken by physicians and their patients to minimize the possibility ofsignificant herb-drug (natural-synthetic) interactions?How does botanical medicine use complement the prescription of conventionalpharmaceuticals?Are there prescribing gaps that can be filled by botanical medicines? Consider that allopathicphysicians generally prescribe drugs that are anti-symptom. Consider differences in potencyand side-effect profiles between conventional pharmaceuticals and medicinal herbs.Suggested reflection questions:What are your views on efficacy and safety of herbal therapies?How do herbal medicines differ from pharmaceutical medicines you have encountered in yourown experience?In what way do your beliefs on this topic affect your willingness to listen to a patient's storyof herbal medicine use?What information would you require before recommending or prescribing an herbal medicineto a patient?Evaluation strategies:The presenter writes five questions that are included in the pharmacology courseexamination. Students participate in interviewing course strategies in the M3 year and are expectedto incorporate questions about use of herbal products during patient interviews.Student evaluations of curriculum session:Course director has included this lecture for four years.

INTRODUCTION1.1 Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) continues to increase in the United States.Consumption of botanical medicines has increased dramatically over the past decade. Eisenbergreported a rise in use from 2.5% to 12.1% between 1990-1997.[JAMA; 11 Nov 1998] This parallels theskyrocketing increase in sales of herbal products, rising from $20 million annually in 1990 to $400million in 1998. Most use of botanical medicines is self-directed and not under the supervision ofeither a physician or trained herbalist. It is of great concern that patients who combine herbs withdrugs run the risk of adverse natural-synthetic (herb-drug) interactions.Thomas Jefferson Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 82Top-selling herbals - Mass marketAugust 1997 to July $US millions % growth per annumGinkgo 138 140St seal 8 80Cranberry 8 75Valerian 8 351.2 While utilization of botanical medicines is on the rise, the evidence base supporting the efficacy ofthese substances is often limited and confusing. Nevertheless, substantive pharmacological,toxicological, and clinical data are available for numerous botanical medicines.For example, one key database has been constructed by the European Scientific Cooperative onPhytotherapy (ESCOP) that currently contains more than 200 clinical trials in addition topharmacological and toxicological data on 60 botanical medicines. The problem is that historically,graduates of US medical schools have had minimal or no exposure to these data.1.3 NIH funding for research in botanical medicine has rapidly increased through the Office of DietarySupplements (ODS) and The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).Six botanical research centers have been funded around the country.1.4 According to the model of Integrative Medicine, botanicals and other complementary therapies canbe combined with conventional care to improve health outcomes. There is an urgent need to trainphysicians to proactively counsel patients on the safe use of botanical medicines and monitor themfor adverse events. Physicians who prescribe botanical medicines must learn how to access clinicallyrelevant databases and seek out the latest research findings in order to bring a truly evidence-basedapproach to the bedside.2. DEFINITION AND SCOPE OF BOTANICAL MEDICINE2.1 Drug. Substance used to treat disease or improve health. Botanical medicines are drugs, althoughthey are not regulated as drugs in the United States. (They are regulated as drugs in the EuropeanUnion and Australia.)2.2 Botanical medicines. Botanical medicines, herbal medicines and plant medicines are all equivalentterms. They include medicinal herbs and phytomedicines.Medicinal herbsCrude drugs of botanical origin. Administered as teas, soups, or compresses. Traditionally, severalcrude herbs are prescribed in combinations known as formulas.Thomas Jefferson Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 83 PhytomedicinesPharmaceutical preparations made by extracting herbs with various solvents to yield tinctures, oils,nonstandardized extracts, or standardized extracts.2.3 A standardized extract means that the plant material is processed in such a way as to assure thecontent of one phytochemical. Historically, St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L) extracts werestandardized to hypericin content. Recently, it has become clear that hypericin is not essential for itsmood-elevating effects but may be responsible for the majority of its drug-herb interactions. Newextracts are being developed that are standardized to hyperforin content.2.4 Examples of botanical volgare (Fennel black cohosh root extract, produced in Germany, distributed inthe US by GalaxoSmithKline\u2014alleviation of menopausal symptoms.Iscar\u00ae: Parenteral, standardized whole plant extract of European mistletoe\u2014used incomplementary cancer therapy.Thomas Jefferson Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 842.5 Botanical medicine systems Local, folkMedical systems such as, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda, Tibetan, Native AmericanMedicineEuropean phytomedicine industry3. CULTURAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS3.1 Cultural contextBotanical medicines the basic materia medica for 75% of human beings.Tradition of self-care. Place in the family medicine chest.NOT East vs West_Use of most plant medicines were dropped out of urban American culturepost WWI but remained very prominent part of healthcare in Western Europe.In many cultures, use of botanical medicines confirms a vital relationship between humanbeings and nature. 3.2 Therapeutic principlesIn contrast to allopathic medicine, botanical medicines were not historically prescribed onlyas antidotes to symptoms. Instead, medicines were given in order to balance, nourish,harmonize, and tonify. We don't have \"tonics\" in our PDR.Thomas Jefferson Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 85Medicinal herbs were traditionally given to support the body's own healing resources.Conventional pharmacotherapy often overrides or suppresses these mechanisms of healing.For example, the conventional treatment of acute infection would include antibiotics, whichoverride the immune response, and fever-reducing medications called antipyretics, whichsuppress the immune response. Traditional herbal formulas include herbs to enhanceresistance (e.g. echinacea) and modulate fever (e.g. hawthorne).3.3 ControversiesWhole plant vs. single phytochemicalPoint: The spectacular success of conventional pharmacotherapy has demonstrated thepower of isolating and administering single-chemical agents to achieve desired effects andassure purity and dose control. Digoxin is far superior to foxglove extract in treatingcongestive heart failure. This has led to suspicion of any plant-based medicine that has notbeen ultimately refined into a purified single chemical agent.Counterpoint: A medicinal plant contains a micro-array of phytochemicals that worksynergistically to increase effectiveness and reduce toxicity.Natural vs. syntheticPoint: Synthetic implies purity and control.Counterpoint: Plant substances have coevolved in that they are more easily utilized by thehuman body and are less likely to produce long-term, unpredictable toxicities. EvidencePoint: There is a paucity of highest quality clinical trial data available to \"prove\" theefficacy of botanical medicine. Use of botanicals cannot be condoned.Counterpoint: There is an abundance of data of varied quality that can and ought to beinterpreted, leading to the rational use of plant medicines\u2014see discussion below on EvidenceBase.Metaphysical1.Point: Plants, like human beings, are only physical, chemical structures.2.Counterpoint: Living systems contain qualities, \"energies,\" and information that are notreducible to biochemistry. Plants offer healing qualities that are not limited to chemicalcontent.Thomas Jefferson Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 864. EVIDENCE BASE OF BOTANICAL MEDICINE 4.1 Historical / Traditional (Ethnobotanical) Many herbs have undergone an extensive empirical trial of safety and efficacy over thousands ofyears. Mills's Rule: Credibility is increased when two cultures, separated geographically, develop similaruse of a medicinal herb. An example is Arnica montana, applied externally to soft tissue injuries toreduce pain and swelling in South America and in Europe. Melatonin is an example of a biochemicalthat is endogenous to humans and plants. Traditional practitioners were well aware of the typical actions of medicinal herbs and catagorizedthem accordingly. The pharmacological underpinnings of these catagories have been demonstrated(see Table ):Table: Pharmacodynamic Effects of HerbsArchetypal phytochemicalsubgroup and common sourcesSubjective impact applicationin traditional medicine plantsrich in this 2001.acrid, preventing foodpoisoning in hot climates,sustaining febrile response increasedgastric secretions5, propylacticagainst some food poisoning, painRelief6, 7, 8, 9, 10, increase inabsorption of other nutrients pharma-ceutical of its ownThomas Jefferson Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 87Archetypal phytochemicalsubgroup and common sourcesSubjective impact and applicationin traditional medicine of plantsrich in this pharmacologicalactivityanthraquinoneand e.g. in topically anti-inflammatoryLaxative13,14,15,anti-inflammatory16,17aromatic oilse.g. in cinnamon, cardamon, fennel,rosemary other kitchen spicesaromatic and warming, settlingdigestion, stimulating digestion indebilitated states, warmingtreatment for bronchial congestionsCarminative18, 19, 20, spasmolyticxx21,anti-inflammatory22,antiseptic23, 24, peel, grapes,elderflowercolor, fever management, digestivemodulator, wound 44, 45, 46, and abrasions,reducing coughing due to soothing upper digestiveinflammationsphysical basis for soothingproperties demonstrated54, Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 884.2 PharmacodynamicAs stated above, many medicinal herbs have been studied for their pharmacodynamic effects on thebody. This refers to their action on biological function. It does not, however, prove clinical effects. Forthis we need a clinical trial in a patient population. However, the fact that Arnica montana, forexample, inhibits lysosomal enzymatic activity in neutrophils lends credence to its role as an anti-inflammatory agent.4.3 Clinical TrialsHundreds of clinical trials have been conducted on botanical medicines. Many, if not most, must beinterpreted with caution because of any number of the following caveats: Small sample size Short study period Poor definition of baseline and endpoints Industry sponsorship (outcome bias)While the German pharmaceutical industry has sponsored the majority of clinical trials, many of theseindustry products bear little resemblance to the medicinal herbs used historically. For example,clinical depression was a traditional contraindication to the use of St. John's wort! Gingko biloba leafwas not used in traditional herbal medicine. Also, keep in mind that the highly refined, standardizedextract of St John's wort or Gingko biloba are certainly not equivalent to the action of dried, bulkherb.4.4 \"Triangulating\" the DataGiven the paucity of highest-quality controlled clinical trials, we can still make headway by bringingtogether data from each of the above categories in order to build a case for credibility, safety, andefficacy. For instance, consider astragalus:Historical / traditional\u20145000 years of empiric usage in China to tonify vital energy (Chi).Pharmacodymanic\u2014Enhances cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, protective againstparainfluenza infection in mice, modulates mitochondrial oxygen consumption,hepatoprotective in liver injury model.Clinical trial\u2014Positive trials reported in China for improving leukopenia, chemotherapy,hepatitis. 4.5 Expert ReviewsExpert reviews bring together these different kinds of data. No single review is without flaws.Thomas Jefferson Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 89However, these are invaluable resources for the medical student and practicing physician who needsto know more about specific herbs:The Complete German Commission E Monographs, published by the American BotanicalCouncil.European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP)Cochrane Collaborationwww.NaturalDatabase.comAuthoritative textbooks: V Tyler, S Mills (see beginning of lecture notes).5. SAFETY5.1 Quality and purity5.1.1. USA.Medical evidence pyramid. Building a case for the use of a botanical medicine requires triangulationof data that includes the historical record of use by large populations over hundreds or thousands ofyears.In the USA the supply of herbal products is currently regulated by the Dietary Supplement Health andEducation Act 1994 (DSHEA), an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which theFDA enforces. Herbal products are considered to be food supplements and are not regulated asprescription or over-the-counter drugs. Manufacturers are allowed to make claims for effects on the\"structure and function of the body or on general wellbeing\" as long as such claims can besubstantiated and cannot be construed as \"therapeutic claims\" (i.e., treating symptoms or diseases).This regulatory policy raises many concerns over product quality and the safety of botanicalmedicines produced or sold in the United States. Without mandatory quality controls, there can be noguarantee of product content or purity, and contamination with xenobiotics (biologically activecontaminants) does occur. Beware of discount products!Manufacturers in the United States are held to the standard of Current Good Manufacturing Practices(CGMP) for foodstuffs, which are much less stringent than CGMP for pharmaceuticals. It should benoted that certain manufacturers voluntarily register with the FDA as pharmaceutical companies andcomply with pharmaceutical CGMP. One example is PhytoPharmica/Enzymatic Therapy. However,there is no mandatory government inspection. In March 2003, the FDA proposed mandatory CGMPsfor dietary supplements that would assure across-the-board product quality\u2014STAY TUNED!Dietary Supplement Verification Program (DSVP) is a new initiative of the United StatesPharmacopoeia (USP). This is a new program of the USP, an independent, nongovernmentalorganization that has established standards for more than 3,400 prescription and over-the-counter(OTC) medicines which pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to meet.In the meantime: check out ConsumerLab.com, which provides independent verification of dietarysupplements: www.consumerlab.com. Thomas Jefferson Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 905.1.2. European Union and AustraliaBotanical medicines are regulated as pharmaceuticals in Europe and Australia. This means that federallaw regulates and enforces pharmaceutical-grade quality and purity. German companies thatdistribute in the United States include MMS and Weleda. An example of an Australian company isMediHerb. 5.1.3 Asian Herbs (Chinese, Ayurvedic, Tibetan)There is a particular concern about medicinal herbs grown in Asia, where there is widespreadcontamination of ground-water with lead and other heavy metals. Many Chinese herbal patentmedicines have been found to be adulterated with pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics and steroids.Certain Asian herb companies do appear to maintain the strictest standards by controlling cultivationand providing external certificates of analysis by independent agencies.5.2 ToxicityToxicity data are available for hundreds of medicinal herbs. Hundreds of medicinal herbshave been established to be nontoxic when ingested at certain doses and intervals. Bycontrast, approximately one third of the herbs reviewed by the German Commission E arelisted as \"unapproved,\" either because efficacy is not established or because of potential ordocumented toxicity. Highly toxic herbs, such as foxglove, were rarely used in traditionalmedicine. Legislation has been proposed to ban the sale of Ma Huang (pronounced mah hwahng) ormandate a warning label. Ma huang is the plant source of ephedra, an adrenaline-typecompound. Historically, it has been used safely in Traditional Chinese Medicine formulas,where it is included in modest amounts and its pharmacology is balanced by otherconstituent herbs. However, there has been an explosion of ma huang containing weight lossThomas Jefferson Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 91and stimulant products on the market, none of which are regulated by the FDA because theyare classified as food supplements. This is an example of taking a traditional herbal medicineout of its historical context and exploiting its pharmacological properties.Although products with ephedra make up less than one percent of dietary supplement sales,it has accounted for 64 percent of the serious side effects that have been reported to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention in association with dietary supplements. Theseadverse reactions include: increase in heart rate, increase in blood pressure, heart rhythmproblems, links to heart attack, stroke, sudden death, insomnia, nervousness, tremors,headache, seizures.A useful discussion of this issue is available at: http://www.herbs.org/greenpapers/tdh-pres.html.Another well-known example of herb toxicity is the kidney failure produced by the herbAristolochia fangchi. This was documented in multiple patients who inadvertently ingestedaristolochia when it was substituted because of a manufacturing error for other, non-toxicherbs in certain Chinese herb formulas.Many medicinal herbs should be avoided during pregnancy. It is important to be verycautious when investigating the safety of an herbal medicine during pregnancy.5.3 Natural-synthetic (herb-drug) interactions5.3.1 Pharmacokinetic interactionsA botanical medicine may alter Drug absorption from the gut: tannins, mucilages, bitter digestives5.3.1.3 Elimination cytochrome P450 enzymes14 enzyme families found in most tissueCYP3A4 is example, metabolizing drugs with will decrease drug levels5.3.2 Pharmacodynamic interactionsA botanical medicine may alter biological effects on target organs. Examples: Standardized extract of Gingko biloba has been demonstrated to reverse symptoms of dementia andmay be an effective treatment for claudication (leg pain resulting from atherosclerosis). Its ingestionmay increase the likelihood of hemorrhage in patients taking coumadin, an anticoagulant. Yohimbe, an herbal aphrodesiac, may produce a hypertensive crisis in patients taking cyclicantidepressants.5.3.3 Favorable natural-synthetic interactions Milk thistle may afford protection from hepatotoxic effects of pharmaceuticals Ginger and bitters may mitigate chemotherapy side effects of nausea and constipation.Thomas Jefferson Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 926.0 CLINICAL EXAMPLESCase 1: You are catching a cold: Upper respiratory tract infection.Echinacea Andrographis Thomas Jefferson Pharmacology Herbal Medicine Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 93Steam Inhalation Treatments with Chamomile and Eucalyptus oil - an application of aromatherapy(use of essential oils).

HOW TO LEARN MORE: NEXT STEPS7.1 The best, first book to read is Tyler's Herbs of Choice\u2014see top of lecture notes.7.2 The best textbook currently available is Principles and Practice of Phytotherapy by Simon Millsand Kerry Bone;Churchill Livingstone, 2000.7.3 Another good reference is: The Complete German Commission E Monographs, published by theAmerican Botanical Council.7.4 Increasing numbers of medical education conferences on herbal medicine are being given.Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons offers a comprehensive and expensive 5-6day medical education conference in botanical medicine each year.7.6 Spend time at the Jefferson Center for Integrative Medicine\u20146215 Gibbon. A most popularmedicinal among medical students.7.7 Drink more herbal teas! There is no substitute for experiential learning. Start with the carminatives(chamomile, fennel) and digestives (ginger). Chamomile tea is also a good nightcap. 8. STUDY QUESTIONSRecognizing the fact that botanical medicines are not FDA regulated, how do you obtainhigh quality products in the United States?What steps can be taken by physicians and their patients to minimize the possibility ofclinically significant herb-drug (natural-synthetic) interactions?In theory, at least, how does botanical medicine \"complement\" the prescription ofconventional pharmaceuticals? Are there specific \"gaps\" that may be filled in by botanicalmedicines? (In answering this question, consider that allopathic physicians generallyprescribe drugs that are anti-symptom. Also consider differences in potency and side-effectprofiles between conventional pharmaceuticals and medicinal herbs.)9. REFERENCES1Kawada T, Sakabe S, Watanabe T, et al.

Learning activities include didactic sessions, studentpresentations, hands-on learning, and observation of demonstrations. Principles of epidemiology andinterpretation of the clinical literature are presented and discussed. During the course, students areassigned individual reports of clinical trials that they summarize and present to other students.Approximately 60 % of the course is devoted to didactic and discussions of cases involving patientswho request or demand alternative therapies.The sample case \"My Aching Back\" is presented and discussed in the first week of the course.Prior to case presentation, students are assigned a meta-analysis review paper on effectiveness ofmassage and chiropractic care in the treatment of lower back pain. During the first session, achiropractor provides a short lecture on the history of chiropractic medicine. The course directorprovides a brief review of the common treatment of lower back pain from a traditional \"InternalMedicine\" perspective. Students receive an orientation to the case, a list of study questions to guidetheir approach to the case, and a list of assigned readings that provide supportive referenceinformation. A set of the patient's radiographs are available for review. On the second day of the case,the patient and his chiropractor visit the class. Students are able to interview the patient, collectingsocial and medical history. They observe as the chiropractor provides a treatment to the patient, andthey ask questions of the provider. After the patient and the chiropractor leave, students and facultydiscuss what they have seen and discovered.On the third day a massage therapist demonstrates a variety of therapies used for back painon each member of the class. The history of massage is presented along with the evidence for its use.During the final session of the case, students are guided by discussion questions as they work togetherto determine the risk/benefits of massage and chiropractic care. Students consider actions taken by thepatient based on his beliefs and expectations, ethical considerations of continuing care that may becontraindicated, tolerance for continuation of palliative care versus seeking a definitive remedy forthe pain, and choosing between therapeutic options when there is no conclusive evidence for just one.Sample Discussion Questions (See also attached Objectives and Study Questions):What aspects of chiropractic support the notion that it is a \"nonconventional\" medicaltechnique? What aspects are \"conventional\"?Based on published literature, what are potential adverse effects of chiropractic?What evidence is there to support effectiveness, safety, and cost effectiveness?What language would you use to discuss chiropractic with a patient who insists on achiropractic referral for an acute injury?Would you recommend chiropractic to one of your patients? Under what circumstanceswould you recommend it to a member of your family?Suggested Reflection Questions:What did you learn from this case? What surprised you?Harvard Case Study: Chiropractic for Back Pain CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 101What were the most important goals of the patient in seeking pain relief? How is thatdifferent from your beliefs on seeking pain relief?In what ways do your beliefs affect your willingness to listen to a patient's story?In what ways will your approach to patients change after this experience?Resource Materials:Syllabus includes extensive required and recommended reading list and list of studyquestions (attached).Evaluation Strategies (course): Students are evaluated on their participation in case discussions. Other aspects of the courseare also evaluated, including presentation of journal articles and a proposal for a clinical trial basedon their examination of a group of cases.Student Evaluations of Curriculum Session:Students complete an evaluation of this case study and the course overall at the end of thecourse. Over the past ten years, student feedback has been very positive. Comments from studentsshow that this approach to teaching, using direct observation and hands-on training, is very effective.Several of the students have turned the class project into a grant proposal for NIH funding.Challenges to Presenting This Unit: Time intensive for providers and patients. Locating the right CAM therapists who respect the medical model and are abledemonstrators. Teaching the basics of epidemiology and assessment of trial literature in just a few hours. Finding a time when students have as much as two hours per day outside of class to readthe assigned readings.Harvard Case Study: Chiropractic for Back Pain CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 102CONTRIBUTED CURRICULUM MATERIALSCourse overviewCase studyBibliographyHarvard Case Study: Chiropractic for Back Pain CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 103COURSE OVERVIEW*Introduction\"Complementary, Alternative, Integrative\" (a.k.a. \"unorthodox,\" \"nonconventional,\" \"holistic\")medicine refers to medical techniques not in conformity with the beliefs or standards of theconventional medical community and include: chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathy, massage,herbal medicines, spiritual healing, and macrobiotic diets. The objectives of this course are:1.to gain knowledge of the basic theory and practice of alternative therapies commonly used inthe United States;2.to summarize the state of basic science knowledge and data from controlled trials relating tothe efficacy and mechanisms of action of alternative therapies;3.to identify study design limitations and propose creative solutions;4.to learn to discuss alternative therapy use with patients. Course format includes lectures,demonstrations, epidemiologic reviews, and discussions of cases involving patients whorequest or demand alternative therapies.The course addresses the ways in which beliefs, expectations, and conditioning predictably confoundrigorous scientific inquiry and complicate patient-doctor communications. Students are required todesign a prospective randomized controlled trial to critically assess one or more alternative medicaltherapies. * Reproduced by permission of Osher Institute at Harvard Medical School.Harvard Case Study: Chiropractic for Back Pain CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 104Case Author: David Eisenberg, M.D.Case I: My Aching Back...Part IMr. Frank Richards is a 46-year-old gentleman with a strong handshake and a salesman's smile. Heprefers to call you by your first name and asks that you call him Frank. Frank retired at 42, havingsuccessfully managed and owned four McDonald's restaurants. He is currently investigating otherbusiness opportunities, but is troubled by intermittent, severe low back pain. His past medical historyis significant for mild hypertension for which he initially tried nonpharmacologic therapy (i.e., saltrestriction, aerobic exercise, and daily relaxation response techniques). Ultimately, nonpharmacologicinterventions failed to adequately control his blood pressure and he resorted to pharmacotherapy. Hecurrently uses enalapril 5 mg. PO q.d. and has a blood pressure of 120/80.Frank's back problems are not lifelong. Although he had one episode of back strain at age 16, he didnot experience severe back discomfort until his early 40s. In the past year, he has had three discreteepisodes of disabling back pain precipitated by strenuous exercise or yard work. Each episode hasrequired bed rest and was self-limited (i.e., resolving within two or three weeks). Frank uses ice packsand nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute back pain. He insists he is now avoiding anyheavy lifting; claims to swim two or three times a week and to take ibuprofen whenever his back\"starts to act up.\" Nonetheless, if Frank plays squash more than twice a week or lifts anything heavierthan five pounds, he develops stiffness and moderate discomfort in his low back. He is quiteconcerned that he is going to precipitate a fourth incapacitating episode of low back pain.While at his health club, Frank attended a lecture by a Boston-based chiropractor. Intrigued by thechiropractor's approach, Frank would like to see this chiropractor for consultation and therapy. Heasks you, his physician, what you think about chiropractic in his case. \u00a92001 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College. All rights reserved.

Frank returns for a routine blood pressure check. He informs you that hehas continued to have intermittent low back pain. Without your knowledge, he referred himself to anorthopedic surgeon at a prestigious clinic. The orthopedist's diagnosis was \"lumbar spondylosis.\"According to Frank, the surgeon recommended regular swimming exercises, physical therapy, andcontinued use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Frank received physical therapy forthree months and gradually increased his swimming to three or four times per week. However, he hasexperienced little or no relief of his chronic back discomfort.Frank tells you he next referred himself to a neurosurgeon. [Office reports from the neurosurgeon anda report of the CT of the patient's spine are included.] According to Frank, the neurosurgeon told himthat his CT scan was negative and \"there is nothing in your back to fix and not much we can do foryou medically.\" The surgeon recommended continued use of nonsteroidals, continued swimming andthe addition of a back brace for additional support.Frank reports that after conservative conventional therapy failed to bring him relief, he soughtconsultation of a local chiropractor. According to the chiropractor's with a soft tissue component that would probably need additionaltherapy ... and various fixations (subluxations) of aswell sacroiliac joints.\"The chiropractor's treatment consisted of \"diversified adjusting of T10 and L5 and the use ofblocks.\" In addition, the chiropractor prescribed \"ultrasound/high volt trigger point therapy to thelumbar paraspinal muscles.\" Frank initially received treatments from the chiropractor twice weeklyand was given specific stretching exercises. In addition, the chiropractor referred Frank to a licensedmassage therapist for \"adjunctive neuromuscular therapy.\" Frank tells you that after the first twoweeks of chiropractic therapy, he felt great relief from his back stiffness and pain. Chiropractictreatments were then scheduled once per week. After an additional six weeks, Frank was able toperform all normal activities without significant discomfort. Since then, chiropractic treatments havebeen scheduled monthly. Frank tells you the combination of chiropractic and massage therapy hashelped him enormously.Part IIIIn addition to chiropractic treatments, Frank went to a licensed massage therapist for \"adjunctiveneuromuscular therapy.\" The massage therapist's initial assessment included the following:\"muscle spasm and hypertonis of muscles.\"Initial therapy consisted of 1) myofascial release, 2) deep muscle trigger point therapy, and 3) cross-fiber friction massage to the above mentioned muscle groups. Frank was also noted to have\"secondary spasm involving muscle groups of the neck and shoulders.\" These regions also receivedthe above-mentioned therapies.In addition to muscle spasm and hypertonis, the massage therapist felt that the patient's \"energymeridians\" in the area of his sacral and lumbar spine were significantly blocked. He therefore usedgentle acupressure release at relevant points in an effort to improve the patient's condition.Harvard Case Study: Chiropractic for Back Pain CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 106Treatments were initially scheduled once per week for the first two or three months (coincident withchiropractic therapy) and then less frequently for \"maintenance.\"Frank tells you that the massage therapist has \"hands like radar.\" He is convinced that this therapyhas resulted in extraordinary relief and increased mobility. Frank demonstrates how limber he hasbecome by placing both palms on the floor. He encourages you to meet his massage therapist so youcan consider referring other patients to him.CASE I: Office Notes from Neurosurgeon3/9/--Mr. Richards is a 47-year-old who has had intermittent episodes of low back pain for a number ofyears. He has had on one occasion pain radiating down the left leg to the heel. He is quite limitednow in all activities and his condition has not been responsive to chiropractic or physical therapy.On examination, he has an extremely rigid back that does not bend at all. He does have good lateralmotion and rotational movements. Heel walking and toe walking are well performed. His deeptendon reflexes are symmetrical. Sensory examination is also normal. Thigh circumferences measure42 centimeters on the right, 41 on the left. Calf circumference is 36 on the right, 35 on the left.I have reviewed his x-rays, which show him to have a spondylolysis of L5. I suspect he has an L4-5disc and have asked that he obtain a CT scan. I plan to see him again after that has been obtained.3/29/--Mr. Richards is seen in follow-up. I have reviewed his CT scan with him, which shows no evidence ofdisc. I have discussed the significance of the spondylolysis at L5. I have recommended a warm 'nform orthosis and have discussed a physical therapy program of lumbar muscle settings.

During the largegroup presentation, students review a case, consider definitions, and compare concepts of spiritualityand religion in culture and their relationship to health and healing. Statistics on physicians' andAmerican's beliefs on the impact of spiritual attitudes and empirical evidence from research studiesare presented, as are barriers to discussing spiritual issues. Two spiritual assessment tools arespecifically highlighted, as follows: Puchalski's FICA model (Faith and Belief, Importance andInfluence, Community, Address/Action) and Anandarajah's HOPE model (Hope Sources, OrganizedReligion, Personal Spirituality and Practices, Effects on Medical Care and End-of-life issues).The one-hour large-group presentation is followed by a one-hour small group session focusedon this topic. The 10 individuals in each small group and assigned physician educator (master tutor)continue to meet together as a small group throughout the first year of medical school. Facultyleaders receive an extensive discussion guide (sample Master Tutor Guide included) to aid infacilitation of the supporting small group session.Reinforcement for this introductory unit is provided in several ways throughout thecurriculum. First, students are directed to the optional Online Educational Module on Spirituality inHealthcare that provides a menu of topics. Educational goals, key terms, stages of spiritualdevelopment, evidence base of spirituality in health care, cultural considerations, and information onreferrals for spiritual and religious counseling are included. A case is highlighted and a videointerview demonstrates a physician incorporating the spiritual interview. Reflection questions areincorporated into each component of the online module to further develop understanding of the topicand to aid the learner in identifying his or her own beliefs on this topic. Students also practice usingthe spiritual interview tool while interviewing seniors at nearby nursing homes.In the future, students will practice spiritual interviewing skills during their Physician andPatient M1 year course, and an OSCE evaluation at the end of the M1 year will assess competency.Discussion questions (see also Master Tutor Guide to small group discussion):What kinds of information may help you understand a patient's fears?What are the resources used by patients when they are facing health challenges?How do you define spirituality? How is it similar or different to religion?What is the relationship between spirituality and religion? How do they both relate to culture,health, and healing?To what extent is it the responsibility of the physician to assess a patient's spiritual beliefs?What are you missing if you do not assess a patient's spirituality?Who else in the medical center may be of help in assessing spiritual beliefs or religiouspractices?Reflection questions (included):What does spirituality mean to you?In what way did the session change your idea of spirituality?What is the healing response to supported spiritual beliefs?How might awareness of your spiritual beliefs aid or hinder your relationship with a patient?What are your views on the healing response to supported spiritual beliefs?Additional Reflection Questions:What will you do differently in patient interviews after learning about the spiritual interview?University of Minnesota Web-based Spirituality Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 115Resource Material (Samples, Web page provides reference list):1.

Self-assessment spirituality tool, and discussionII. Discussion of Session topic questionsIII. Discussion of Session caseNote to tutors: It would be tremendously helpful for each of you to have completed the self-guidedlearning resource module on Spirituality in Healthcare listed in on-line resources on the Center forSpirituality and Healing Website. It takes approximately three hours to complete in full, with quizzes,but could be skimmed in a shorter period of time. Having taken time to answer these questions foryourself, if you have not, will make the discussion much more powerful.I. Self-assessment spirituality tool (10 min.)The students should have taken both of the self-assessment tools included in syllabus materials(master tutors are suggested to fill them out as well).Lead a brief discussion about any self-discovery that occurred. Did this process change their idea ofspirituality?Consider in the discussion how awareness of the students' own spirituality may help them be able tobetter respond to patients and their needs. Consider situations in which the student's beliefs orpractices may cause an initial conflict or challenge in meeting the patients where they are. Examples:an atheist physician interacting with a religiously devout patient, or a physician with a strongspiritual belief that is in conflict with a behavior or choice of a patient. Consider how reframingvocabulary can help ease discomfort. (Example: \"Everyone in my church is praying for me\" could beunderstood as \"I have tremendous emotional support from my community.\") This may helpphysicians not be reactive when they are uncomfortable.The tutors may wish to briefly discuss how an understanding of their own spirituality has impactedtheir own clinical practice and their ability to respond consciously to patients, regardless of theirpersonal religious or spiritual orientation.II.Discussion of session topic questions (30 min.)You may wish to initiate this discussion with some example of the issue of spirituality as it has arisenwith a patient you have cared for, either one where not knowing the spiritual or religious issues mayhave impeded optimal medical care, or one in which understanding a belief system may have helpedguide your clinical decision-making process. The questions posed in the syllabus follow, withdiscussion points in italics.1. How do you define spirituality? How is it similar or different to religion?Acknowledge the broad spectrum of perspectives you expect to be included in such a group,and note the discomfort some individuals may be experiencing (ranging from the skepticism ofatheists to the very structured mindset of the religiously devout to those who feel the entiretopic is irrelevant to physicians.) Discussion about these emotional responses will alloweveryone to speak honestly, without fear of censure. Relevance may be emphasized by notingthat the AAMC, in its Learning Objectives for Medical School in 1998, specified that\"physicians must seek to understand the meaning of their patients' stories in the context ofthe patients' beliefs and family and cultural values.\" There are a wide variety of definitionsof spirituality, which may include the following concepts: sense of energy, vitality,University of Minnesota Web-based Spirituality Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 127consciousness, essence, inspiration, reverence, meaning, purpose, harmony, transcendence,connection, infinite ... .A flip chart collection of input from the students will help lay out the broad range of ideaspresent.One example of a working definition is:AAMC definition: Spirituality is recognized as a factor that contributes tohealth in many persons. The concept is found in all cultures and societies. It isexpressed in an individual's search for ultimate meaning through participation inreligion and/or belief in God, family, naturalism, rationalism, humanism, and thearts. All of these factors can influence how patients and health care professionalsperceive health and illness and how they interact with another.Compare and contrast both the definition and purpose of spirituality and religion,acknowledging the challenge of doing this in words. Some main points of commonality mayinclude: a relationship with the transcendent, a set of beliefs around meaning and purpose,adherence to a set of ethical beliefs, and activities such as prayer, meditation, reading sacredwritings, celebratory singing and dancing, and retreat. Religion serves the function ofnurturing communal, as well as individual spirituality, by prescribing a set ideology,ceremonial practices, proscriptions, and participation in community. In contrast, spiritualitycan be fiercely individual, and is a universal dimension of human experience even in thosewho have no belief in a higher power. Spirituality is an experience of meaning and purpose,which may be supported or thwarted by a particular religious community. Indeed, hightension may exist between these two closely related entities.2. Should I apply research findings in spirituality and religion to my clinical practice, andif so, how?The research as it was reviewed in a large group is equivocal and focuses mostly on religiousbehaviors and practices, versus issues of deeper spirituality. It is unlikely that individuals would feelcomfortable prescribing a change in religious beliefs or practices (any more than they would suggestthat patients get married to lower their mortality risk). However, following the research as it evolves,and using it to support or reinforce healthy, positive behaviors in patients, may serve a therapeuticpurpose. At the very least, knowing what issues may be present because of a patient's religious orspiritual beliefs can serve a very practical role in facilitating optimal patient care and understandingunderlying motivations and barriers to treatment.3. What is the physician's job, if any, in addressing either the religious issues or spiritualneeds of patients? Is the physician responsible for doing this job?Encourage the students to explore the pros and cons of addressing these issues as a physician(Cons may include time limitations, personal bias, disbelief in importance/relevance in treatment,discomfort or unfamiliarity with subject area, lack of support team to make referrals or unwillingnessto go through a referral process.) (Pros may include a deeper understanding of patients' perspectivesand motivations, ability to work within patients' belief systems when making treatmentrecommendations, optimization of patients' larger religious or spiritual support system, possibleincrease of meaning in one's own work in a service profession.)There are other members of the care team who may be well-placed in a given scenario, ormore inclined to do this job. In the in-patient setting, there is an intake done by nursing that maygather this information. Sometimes, pastoral care may become involved through requests of thefamily or nursing staff. However, it behooves the physician to be aware of whether appropriateassessments have been done and what the assessment revealed. In some settings, the physician maybe the only person available to be seeking this information. Time invested up front may facilitateclinical care over time.University of Minnesota Web-based Spirituality Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 1283. What scenarios are most demanding of spiritual support and or understanding ofreligious orientation?Discuss clinical scenarios when these issues may be most obviously critical to adequate andcompassionate clinical care (e.g., end-of-life issues; life-threatening diagnoses; major traumaor loss, such as the death of a child; situations involving transplant, artificial life-support, ororgan donation) Have the students discuss what the value may be of obtaining thisinformation at nonurgent primary care visits, laying the groundwork for a ong-term clinicalrelationship. Drawing from any personal experiences of the group members would be mostpowerful, if they are willing to share. Drawing from the tutor's own clinical experience wouldalso be instructive here.III. Discussion of Session Case (10 min.)The case: 55-year old divorced man with an extensive family history for coronary artery disease(CAD) is in the coronary care unit (CCU) recovering from a cardiopulmonary arrest caused by asevere, initial acute myocardial infarction (MI). He had been a high-powered executive, with astereotypical type A personality. Now, he is depressed, minimally conversant, and uninterested inhis treatment plan. He is unwilling to speak with a psychologist, and seems to have few visitorsor support persons.Several possible spiritual/religious scenarios are as follows. Depression is clearly associated withhigher morbidity and mortality in the post-MI group, and clinically needs to be addressed. Give eachscenario to the group and discuss how understanding the specifics for this patient would altertreatment and hopefully improve outcome.A. He is a man who was raised Catholic but is not actively practicing his religion. He left thechurch in anger when his first marriage failed and has not pursued any religious affiliationsince that time. He, however, still holds deeply ingrained beliefs about a punitive God andpurgatory as a destination for those who have fallen away from the church. He is afraid ofdeath, but not trusting enough to speak to clergy.Because he has issues of fear and anger that stem from religious beliefs, he is probably correct inassuming that a conventional psychological approach to depression may not work with this problem.Because of his anger at the Catholic church, Catholic clergy would likely be rejected, but a non-denominational chaplain, with familiarity with Catholic beliefs, may be able to be of great help to him.A referral to the hospital chaplain, after getting the patient's permission, could be of great benefit.B. He is a very spiritual man who has always trusted that if he led a good life, ate well,exercised, didn't smoke, meditated, had positive relationships with others, and followed yourpurpose in life, he would achieve a longer and healthier life than his father and grandfatherdid. He is sad and disappointed and is seeking deeper meaning for this traumatic event in hislife, but he doesn't belong to an organized church or religion and is unfamiliar with hospitalclergy. Because his beliefs fall outside of accepted religious structure, he doe not know whomto ask for help.He is suffering from a challenge to a deeply held belief system and is grieving that loss. Because hedoes not have comfort from an organized church, he may be at a loss as to whom to discuss theseissues with. Beginning a conversation just with his physician may provide him some support.Involving a psychologist with a transpersonal or spiritual orientation, or a spiritual director or achaplain who is understanding of the circumstances may be acceptable to the patient, after areassuring discussion with the physician.C. He is a man who is deeply spiritual and religious but has felt alienated from his church sincehis divorce. No one from the church knows he's here. He is uncomfortable in reaching out tothat community himself.University of Minnesota Web-based Spirituality Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 129He may be very willing to allow a referral to be called to his community church by the physician ornurse, whereas he may be too prideful to do it himself. The reinstitution of a community supportsystem and reaffirmation of his religious practice would likely be strongly supportive of a betteroutcome after discharge.Albert Einstein Lecture/Discussion: Integrative Approach to Asthma CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 130Albert Einstein Lecture/Discussion: Integrative Approach to Asthma CAHCIM Integrative Medicine Kligler, MD Co-Director, Beth Israel Fellowship Program in Integrative Medicine Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM) Bronx, NYIntegrative Medicine competencies addressed: (see Section 2, list of competencies)Knowledge 8Attitudes 4Skills 2, 5Goals:To apply the process of integrative assessment and treatment planning with a patient withasthmaObjectives:To describe how the integrative assessment differs from the conventional assessment process.To examine the evidence for the application of nutritional medicine, herbal medicine, andmind-body approaches to the treatment of asthma.To develop an integrative treatment plan.To describe the challenges in developing research to adequately examine the integrativeapproach as it is applied in clinical practice.Curriculum component:Required, core lecture in the Family Medicine clerkshipPrimary Target audienceM3 studentsAdditional LearnersResidentsDurationOne hour, repeated once monthly throughout academic year per group of 8 medical studentsLearning Methods employed: Case-based presentation Lecture, PowerPoint Small group discussionAlbert Einstein Lecture/Discussion: Integrative Approach to Asthma CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 132Faculty resources1 medical school faculty for 8 studentsDescription:This case-based presentation is presented as one session within the context of a series ofprimary care topics required for students in the third-year clerkship in Family Medicine. The purposeof this session is to illustrate the application of an integrative assessment and treatment approach to aspecific patient condition, in this case, childhood asthma. The assessment expands on conventionalassessment by including more in-depth discussion of nutritional factors, psychosocial-emotionalfactors, and environmental influences. The integrative treatment approach incorporates whereappropriate, techniques and strategies from various healing arts to the treatment plan.The presenter initially shares information with the group about how the treatment of a childwith asthma can be enhanced by the application of an integrative assessment and treatment approach.Students participate in developing assessment questions through critical reflection and groupdiscussion regarding a host of dimensions of a child's life not typically considered by conventionalmedicine that might bear on his or her asthma. The presenter provides additional information to guideand expand the range of the group's thinking process in regard to assessment and potentialapplications of healing approaches outside of conventional medicine. Evidence from the medicalliterature on the safety and efficacy of each potential intervention is presented and discussed, alongwith cost and practicality of each potential intervention. The group works together to develop areasonable treatment plan taking these issues and the issues of access to CAM therapies in thepatient's community into account. The presenter concludes the session with a description andrationale for the interventions that were actually used and a discussion of the outcome of the case.While this case-based session describes a patient with asthma, the process of developingassessment and treatment options within the context of available evidence can easily be applied toany condition. The application of this \"modified\" evidence-based approach has been very effective indemonstrating to third year students the range of treatment options offered in integrative medicine.Discussion questions:How does the integrative assessment differ from a conventional assessment?What treatment options might arise from a consideration of this broader assessment process?What evidence exists to support these treatment options?Of all these options, which ones would you suggest and why?What are the challenges to meaningful research in clinical applications of integrativemedicine? What research strategies might be used to overcome these obstacles?Suggested Reflection questions:Which of your own health issues or those of family members may be affected by nutritional,psychoemotional, or environmental factors not addressed in the conventional medicalassessment?What are the obstacles you imagine to implementing this broader approach?What do you imagine a patient's response might be when presented with unconventionaltreatment options? How would you feel as the physician offering these options? What doyou think would make you feel comfortable offering these options?Is offering the option the same as recommending the option?What types of evidence make you feel comfortable recommending an intervention? Does thisvary depending on the patient's presenting condition?How does your belief system affect your decisions for particular recommendations?Suggested Resources:1. Lecture notes, attached2.

A unifying principle in this approach is the view of asthma as an inflammatorycondition\u2014a view that has come to be shared by conventional medicine, as first-line treatment optionshave shifted toward use of anti-inflammatory agents such as steroids and leukotriene antagonists. Theintegrative approach utilizes \"anti-inflammatory\" strategies from the realms of nutrition, herbalmedicine, and mind-body medicine as the cornerstones of asthma treatment.1,2 This approach iscomplemented by a more in-depth environmental assessment, including the role of the family and thepsychospiritual state of the patient in this overview.One concept that informs the integrative approach to problems of respiration, regardless ofthe specific disease, is the notion from East Asian medicine that the lungs are the seat of the emotionof grief. Thus the integrative approach to many pulmonary disorders incorporates an examination ofunresolved grief in the patient's life and the possible impact of that on their health. One of the manystudies from the Western literature that may reflect this convergence of thinking is the work by Smythet al on using writing as a therapy for asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, described above. In this study,patients with one or the other of these conditions were asked to write for an hour on three successivedays about their most painful past experience. Controls wrote about a nontraumatic memory or lifeevent. Treatment and control groups were similar in all important respects. The authors found that thetreatment group participants in both disease categories had a reduction in medication use andsymptom scores that lasted through the six-month follow-up period. Further research is needed bothto replicate this finding and to determine through what intracellular mediators such an effect might becreated; the potential relevance for the integrative approach to pulmonary disease, and possibly toinflammatory disease in general, however, is clear.Nutritional approachesNutritional treatment of asthma runs along two parallel tracks. First is the notion that certainfoods may be triggers of airway inflammation through a process of food allergy or sensitivity. Secondis the notion that deficiencies of certain nutrients, such as omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs),certain antioxidants, and magnesium, may play an important role.Conventionally food allergy has been defined as response to certain food antigens on skintesting or on RAST blood testing. Some cases of asthma certainly manifest as a result of this type ofallergy, and once the offending food is identified, symptoms are usually greatly improved byavoidance of this food. More controversial is the role of food \"sensitivity\" in asthma, a response thatis believed to be triggered by exposure of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) to certain foodantigens and then mediated by inflammatory cytokines, interleukin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).This type of sensitivity does not manifest on conventional allergy testing and can be difficult todiagnose other than through a process of food elimination with concomitant symptom monitoring. Anumber of studies have examined the use of elimination diet in both children and adults with asthmawith mixed results.3,4,5,6,7 Some authors feel that the role of food sensitivities has been overstated andthat most reported sensitivities do not stand up to the \"gold-standard\" test of randomized double-blind food challenge.8 However, in clinical practice elimination diet remains a useful tool in thetreatment of asthma. Common causes of food sensitivity in children include dairy foods, eggs, citrus,peanuts, soy, wheat, and chocolate.9A subgroup of patients can have their asthma triggered by exposure to some of the commonfood additives, including tartrazine, sulfites, and certain food dyes.10,11,12,13 This possibility can beaddressed with an intervention that is simpler than an elimination trial, especially in children: a trialof a \"whole food,\" additive-free diet with symptom monitoring. Low-salt diet has also been shown toreduce symptoms in certain patients.11,12Two other potential nutritional interventions bear mention here. The first is that weight lossprograms have been shown to have an important role in asthma treatment for those with * Excerpted with permission from Kligler B, Lee R (eds) Integrative Medicine: Principles for Practice McGraw-Hill, New York,2004.Albert Einstein Lecture/Discussion: Integrative Approach to Asthma CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 144accompanying obesity: a Finnish group found that a 14.5% weight loss in obese subjects led tosignificant improvements in FEV1 and FVC, and to reductions in medication use, frequency ofexacerbation, and subjective experience of dyspnea.14 This benefit persisted over a year of follow-up.The second is that evidence from meta-analysis involving more than 8000 subjects clearly shows thatbreastfeeding during the first three months of life significantly reduces the likelihood of developingasthma by 30-50 %.15 This effect is most pronounced in children with a family history of atopy. Themechanism for this protective effect is not known.The nutritional supplements that have been looked at most rigorously for a role in thetreatment of asthma are magnesium, antioxidants such as vitamin and selenium, and fishoils. Magnesium supplementation, particularly intravenously, has been found to be helpful in thetreatment of acute asthma exacerbation, reducing in several studies the likelihood of admission whenused in the emergency room.16,17,18,19 It does not appear to have a role as an oral supplement in acuteexacerbation or in either form for the management of chronic asthma. The proposed mechanism forits effect in acute asthma is a short-term but potent relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle;animal models do support this as a potential mechanism.11Antioxidants, including vitamin C, selenium, and lycopene, have been examined for a role inasthma treatment based on the notion that the recurrent and/or chronic state of inflammation in theairways creates a higher level of oxidative stress for the bronchial cells, thus leading in turn to avicious cycle of ongoing release of inflammatory mediators, increased edema in the bronchial wall,and increased asthma symptoms. The conclusion regarding vitamin C is that it does have a modesteffect in protecting the airways from hyper-responsiveness to provocative stimuli. 20,21,22,23,24 Vitamin Cmay also have a role in antagonizing prostaglandin-induced bronchoconstriction.25 Population studieshave also confirmed that adults with the lowest serum levels of vitamin C have the highest risk ofbronchial reactivity.26 Long-term benefit of vitamin C therapy in reducing asthma symptoms has notbeen demonstrated to date. The question remains also as to whether supplementation with vitamin Cwill confer the same benefit in terms of decreased airway sensitivity that has been suggested byepidemiological studies of a high vitamin C diet. Of the other antioxidants, lycopene appears to be themost promising, with one study demonstrating a significant protection from exercise-induced asthmasymptoms with a daily dose of 30 mg of lycopene.27 Selenium supplements may also have a role inreducing bronchial hypersensitivity.28The final category of supplements that have been looked at extensively for treatment ofasthma are the omega-3 polyunsaturated essential fatty acids, such as fish oils. These compoundshave an important role in the treatment of certain inflammatory disorders, as they modulate thearachidonic acid cascade in the direction of the anti-inflammatory 5-series leukotrienes. As such, itwas anticipated that fish oils would have an important role to play in the treatment of asthma. Forunclear reasons, though, the literature, including a recent Cochrane Collaborative analysis on thisquestion, does not demonstrate any significant improvement in asthma patients using the omega-3EFAs.29,30,30,32,33,34,35,36 The one scenario in which EFA supplementation may hold promise is in childrenif used in combination with dietary manipulation.39 In addition, the possibility remains that EFAsupplementation could be effective as one component of an integrative approach, but not alone.Mind-body approachesA wide range of mind-body approaches have been studied for their application in asthma,including biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation training, yoga, and numerous others.Conventional psychotherapy, and particularly family therapy addressing such issues as the sick roleand the effect of family stress on health, has shown some benefit particularly in children withasthma.37 As mentioned above, Smyth et al examined the potential role of using writing to releaseunresolved trauma or grief, with substantial benefit to their subjects.1Yoga training, in which patients are typically taught a breath-slowing exercise, has beenshown in at least two studies to have a positive impact on medication use, frequency of attacks, andpeak flow rates.38,39 Aside from yoga, a number of other breathing techniques have been used to slowbreathing on the theory that the hyperventilation and hypocapnea which normally accompany airwaynarrowing contribute to the vicious cycle of asthma exacerbation. These techniques, such as theButeyko and Hale methods, teach a slower breathing strategy, which is believed by their proponents toeliminate this trigger for bronchoconstriction by producing hypercapnea, potentially reversing theAlbert Einstein Lecture/Discussion: Integrative Approach to Asthma CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 145asthma attack. The Buteyko breathing approach, as taught via video, has shown promise in at leastone study, which found decreased medication use and improved quality of life in those practicing thetechnique, although without objective change in pulmonary function.40 The use of breathingtechniques in the treatment of asthma requires further study before any definitive conclusions can bedrawn regarding their utility.Biofeedback has been proposed as a strategy for reducing asthma symptoms, particularly inpatients in whom stress has been identified as a trigger. One study that used EMG biofeedback toteach relaxation of the facial muscles demonstrated both short- and long-term (eight months)improvement in FEV1/FVC in a group of asthmatic children as well as a reduction in anxiety and animprovement in their attitudes toward their asthma.41 The authors propose that this benefit is mediatedby a reflex link connecting trigeminal function with vagal function, thus leading to bronchodilatation.Hypnotic suggestion has been shown to be effective in at least one study in reducing airwayhyper-responsiveness and in attenuating the exercise-induced bronchoconstriction experienced bypatients with exercise-induced asthma (EIA). Ewer and Stewart showed in a prospective randomizedtrial that a six-week course of hypnotherapy produced a 75% reduction in response to methacholinechallenge, as well as improvements in symptom score and reduced medication use.42 This benefit,though, was confined to those subjects who scored high on susceptibility to hypnosis; subjects whoscored low in this regard did not experience a significant benefit from the intervention.Hypnotherapy is felt by some to be most effective in childhood asthma, perhaps because of children'stendency toward susceptibility to suggestion.40Manipulative ApproachesMany clinicians feel that there may be a structural problem in asthmatic patients that can beaddressed at least in part by chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation. There are very few studies ofmanipulative approaches for asthma in the medical literature; the 1998 trial in New England Journalof Medicine that looked at chiropractic as an adjunctive treatment for children with asthma failed tofind a significant benefit.43 A second trial, which compared active with sham chiropractic in adults ina crossover design, also found no significant effect of manipulation on pulmonary function measures,medication use, or symptom scores.44 Osteopathic techniques such as lymphatic pump, which iscommonly used in treatment of asthma, have also not been examined in well-controlled trials.The evidence in the literature to date does not support a role for manipulation in thetreatment of asthma. Given the clinical experience of benefit in some cases, though, it may be thatthis approach is useful in certain subgroups where there is a musculoskeletal component and thatresearch needs to focus on how to identify this subgroup for referral for manipulation.The single published study of massage therapy in children with asthma, in which parentswere taught massage therapy and then practiced it with their children for 20 minutes before bedtime,did find a significant reduction in anxiety levels and cortisol levels, as well as an improvement inpeak flow. This effect was more pronounced in the four- to eight-year old group than in the nine- to14-year old group.45Environmental strategiesThe conventional assessment of asthma has typically included environmental evaluation fortriggers: pets, smokers at home, wall-to-wall carpets, cockroaches, etc. The integrative assessmenttakes this one step further to include the potential role of solvents, molds, and chemical sensitivities inasthma.46 A common approach\u2014though one not conclusively substantiated by data to date\u2014is the useof HEPA air filtration and ion generators in treating the home environment. The single published trialof this approach did show a decrease in rhinitis and asthma symptoms with the use of HEPA filtrationin the home.47Homeopathic treatment has been explored as a strategy for the patient with environmentalasthma triggers using a technique called isopathy, or homeopathic immunotherapy. Reilly et aldemonstrated the efficacy of this technique\u2014in which patients are treated with homeopathic dilutionsof the environmental trigger\u2014in a large trial of treatment for allergic rhinitis.48 These results have beenreproduced, and a recent review comprising a total of 350 treated patients confirmed this efficacy.49Proponents have suggested that a similar approach should be effective in asthma that isenvironmental in origin.Albert Einstein Lecture/Discussion: Integrative Approach to Asthma CAHCIM Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 146Botanical medicinesThe botanicals most extensively studied for asthma to date are Tylophora indica and Coleusforskohlii, both Ayurvedic medicines used in asthma. Tylophora, in particular, has shown promise,with at least three randomized double-blind trials demonstrating a decrease in symptoms in thetreatment group.50,51,52 However this herb frequently causes vomiting, limiting its use; neitherTylophora nor Coleus is currently widely available in the United States. A third Ayurvedicherb\u2014Boswellia serrata\u2014has been shown in one randomized trial to reduce asthma symptoms andfrequency of attacks in 70% of treatment subjects, compared with similar improvement in 27% ofcontrols.53 The treatment group also demonstrated significant improvement in pulmonary functiontesting when compared with placebo. This herb contains boswellic acids, which have been shown toinhibit leukotriene synthesis, and is purported to work via this mechanism. This study was only sixweeks in duration, and longer-term studies are needed of this potentially promising herbal treatment.A number of herbs from the Chinese pharmacopeia may also have a role in asthma, includingMa Huang (the source of ephedrine), ginkgo, and licorice. Ma Huang is a fairly potent bronchodilator;however, its adrenergic agonist effects are not specific, and in large doses it can cause significantblood pressure elevation and potentially dangerous arrhythmias. A number of deaths have beenreported from Ma Huang, though it should be noted that in most of these the herb was being used atfar above the therapeutic level typically used in Chinese herbal formulae, and also without anyappropriate medical supervision.54 Licorice, which should be used with caution in anyone withelevated blood pressure because of an aldosterone-like effect, is felt by some to potentiate the effect ofendogenous cortisol, thus acting as an anti-inflammatory agent in some cases.55 Gingko extract,which has been shown in animal studies to inhibit PAF-induced bronchoconstriction, has been studiedin one small trial (eight subjects), which showed a decrease in bronchoconstriction and hyperreactivityin response to allergen challenge. Saiboku-Tu, a Japanese herbal formula containing licorice and nineother herbs, has also shown promise in preliminary studies, particularly as a strategy to reduce steroiddosage in steroid-dependent asthmatics.56Many other herbs have been used in the treatment of asthma, including belladonna, lobelia,marijuana, sorrel, and others; however, to date none of these has been examined systematically forefficacy.57,58Traditional systems: AcupunctureIn a meta-analysis from 1991, Kleijne et al found that trials of acupuncture for asthma up tothat time had failed to conclusively demonstrate any benefit. Most of the trials at that point werepoorly controlled and thus did not have the power to demonstrate any effect.59 There have been atleast two well-done trials that have shown a significant improvement in pulmonary function withacupuncture in the treatment of acute exacerbation;60,61 at least two others, though, failed to showsuch an effect.62 The data in the treatment of chronic asthma are even less compelling: when Tashkinet al expanded the treatment protocol they had found to be effective in acute exacerbation to an eightsession treatment and compared it with sham acupuncture in a blinded crossover design, they foundno significant impact on lung function, medication use, or symptom scores.63 Biernacki and Peakeused a crossover double-blind design and similarly found no difference between real and shamacupuncture, although both showed a significant benefit over no treatment.64 There does appear to bea significant but nonspecific benefit to needling in terms of reported symptoms, though not in termsof pulmonary function. This benefit may stem from the nonspecific release of endorphins that hasbeen documented to accompany acupuncture treatment, whether needles are placed in real or shamlocations.The methodological challenges of studying acupuncture using conventional research designsare addressed elsewhere in the chapter on East Asian Medicine. The Chinese literature on asthmatreatment, which in general consists of uncontrolled studies, many of which use herbal treatments incombination with acupuncture, tends to show much more positive results.65 Although this may be aconsequence of examiner expectations and unblinded design, it could also be that acupuncturealone\u2014particularly the standardized point protocols used in the blinded studies\u2014is not as effective asthe traditional combination of herbal and acupuncture approaches.Albert Einstein Lecture/Discussion: Integrative Approach to Asthma CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 147References1.

He has been hospitalized twice to date at the time of yourfirst visit and has had four courses of oral steroids over the previous year. He is stable at this time oninhaled albuterol and cromolyn; he did not tolerate an inhaled steroid due to cough. His mothercomes for advice on how to reduce his need for steroids over the coming winter.ASTHMA: CASE STUDYThere are no pets, rodents, or smokers in the home, no carpets or drapes. No clear trigger is apparentother than U.R.I. I.C. is otherwise normal in his growth and development, although he has always been15-20th percentile in height, which is of some concern to his mother.WHAT QUESTIONS SHOULD about it?INTEGRATIVE APPROACH: RESEARCH CHALLENGESIn conventional pharmacotherapy, one drug is considered at a time, and combinations second; inintegrative medicine, single interventions are rarely effective, and we on complex combinationregimens. This poses a dilemma in research methodology.DIET HISTORYI.C.'s mother reports that he eats a reasonably varied diet but with an emphasis on pasta, bread, anddairy products, especially yogurt and cheddar cheese. His vegetable and fruit consumption isadequate; he does not consume large quantities of highly processed foods.NUTRITIONAL MEDICINE: DIETARY MANIPULATIONOgle and Bullock 1980: Elimination diet for asthma and rhinitis in children322 subjects6 weeks on hypoallergenic diet followed by food challenge91% improved during trial51% had recurrence of symptoms on food challengeMost common foods in producing allergy symptoms were milk, eggs, chocolate, soy,legumes, oats, corn, rice, citrusSkin testing for allergens did not correlate with clinical symptoms in these infantsAlbert Einstein Lecture/Discussion: Integrative Approach to Asthma CAHCIM Implementation Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 150NUTRITIONAL APPROACHES: SUPPLEMENTS\u2014FISH OILSupplementation with fish oils and other omega-3 EFA supplements has been examined intreatment and prevention of asthma, both as a solitary intervention and in the context ofdietary manipulationHypothesized mechanism of action is a shift in the arachidonic acid cascade away from thepro-inflammatory (5-series) leukotrienesCochrane Collaborative review shows no clear consensus regarding efficacy of fish oilsupplementation as a solitary intervention for asthmaMost promising studies are in children, with a combination of dietary manipulation andomega-3 EFA supplementationNUTRITIONAL APPROACHES: SUPPLEMENTS\u2014ANTIOXIDANTSRole of \"oxidative stress\" in chronic inflammatory state of the asthmaticTheory holds that chronic inflammatory state in asthma with increased cytokine levelsleads to free radical oxidative damage to tissues and perpetuates the vicious cycle ofinflammation and edema in the airwaysVitamin C, selenium, lycopene, and various other antioxidant supplements have beenexamined in treatment of asthmaVitamin C appears to be moderately effectiveLycopene appears to be moderately effectiveEvidence on selenium equivocalPSYCHOEMOTIONAL ISSUESI.C.'s mother reports that she and his father are going through a divorce.

The course is designed with nearly 90 percent of activities devotedto experiential learning, with remaining course time devoted to discussion of techniques, reviewingassigned articles, and addressing student questions. Over the 11 sessions, students experience guidedlearning experiences with mind-body approaches, including self-awareness, relaxation, meditation,guided imagery, biofeedback, physical exercise, art, music, and movement. The course is originallybased on a curriculum model developed by Dr. James Gordon, Director of the Center for Mind-BodyMedicine. This model has been adapted for use in a number of other institutions as well.An initial course orientation is held, where students learn expectations and intendedoutcomes for the course, and complete a precourse self-assessment. Students receive a course syllabusthat presents educational goals, guidelines for group behavior, introductory materials, and details ofeach session. The course pack also provides a list of recommended readings and guidelines forpracticing learned techniques. Articles are also included that focus on the most current evidence forhealth benefits of mind-body medicine and theoretical underpinnings for integrating mind-body skillsin medical practice.In each session, students are introduced to a new mind-body skill and have the opportunityto practice and learn the theory and research behind its practice. Each session has a process forfaculty to follow along with a guide for discussion questions. This process may vary somewhat,depending on the size of the group and issues that are raised in relation to the practice of thetechnique. Of critical importance is the atmosphere of listening, confidentiality, safety, and respectthat is facilitated by the group process.All sessions begin with a five-minute opening meditation. Following the meditation, facultyrequests updates on progress with assigned experiential exercises through a \"check-in\" process.During this weekly \"check-in,\" students are invited one at a time to discuss their progress, successesand challenges that come from practicing the assigned techniques. Faculty members also participatealong with students, sharing their week's experiences, reactions, and perceptions with the group.Following the check-in, a new mind-body skill is introduced by the faculty leader. At this time,techniques are explained and demonstrated, and if relevant, equipment is distributed for use. Studentspractice and process their understanding of this new skill and have an opportunity to reflect and askquestions. Sessions end with a closing five-minute meditation, followed by reminders for reading andpractice assignments. Expectations of students are that they will do \"home practice\" of the skills as they arelearned, including the following for the duration of the course: write at least one journal entry eachday, practice a form of meditation (sitting, walking, eating) for at least 10 minutes a day, three to fivedays per week, participate in one physical activity each day (walking, jogging, playing a sport), andcomplete additional assignments as they are distributed.A typical session would follow the outline presented below:1.

Suggestions have been used to make revisions. The number of students participating hasincreased each year, based in part, on recommendations from students who completed the course.Unique Implementation Challenges:In the dense curriculum, medical students are overwhelmed with the tremendous workload.As an elective, students were wary about adding one more commitment to their schedules. With eachpassing year, the percent of students enrolling has increased to include nearly one third of the firstyear class, limited now by the number of available prepared faculty.Georgetown Experiential Mind-Body Skills Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 154Others who have presented such a course have offered other challenges. Faculty preparationfor this course occurs through participation in a two-week professional training experience, which iscostly. Time to facilitate course is labor intensive. Attention to group process is a critical factor forfaculty involved in facilitating this course. Despite clear information given to students and studentmotivation to elect the course, some may feel unprepared to share personal information about theirown experiences that arise from the practice of these techniques. They are surprised by the range ofexperiences and emotions that arise from practicing these techniques. Time must be available forfaculty to attend to student needs, not only during and in between sessions.Currently, this course is an elective in the curriculum. Experience suggests that it may bebest to maintain it as such. Not all students may want to participate in a class that focuses on intenseself-reflection and self-disclosure with their fellow students. Inclusion of students not interested inthis form of learning may detract from value of the group process for other students.Georgetown Experiential Mind-Body Skills Module CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum Integrative Medicine 156MEDITATIONSession 3: MeditationAgenda:AnnouncementsCandle lightingOpening Meditation (5 minutes)Check-In (questions about previous weeks' lessons and home practice)How are you doing emotionally?How are you doing physically?What are your insights or thoughts, feelings, concerns, or reactions to last week'sgroup session?Introduction of this week's mind-body skill: MeditationEating Meditation:Purpose : This is a tool for developing awareness. This exercise promotes harmony between the food we eat and our body's actual needs. This exercise helps in becoming mindful of sensations associated with eating. Materials : Grapes Other \"finger\" foodActivity : Student will practice eating a [grape] slowly and mindfullyScript for Eating MeditationNormally, most of us eat automatically or mechanically. Now, we are going toexperiment with eating differently, paying full attention in a nonjudgmental, openway, and staying in the moment as much as possible.Take one of these objects, only one. See if you can entertain the notion that you areseeing and sensing this object for the very first time.What does it look like?What shape is it?What colors appear?How does it reflect light?Next, maybe on closer inspection, how does it feel?What is its texture? Its temperature? Its surface density?Perhaps you might also bring it up to your nose. Do you smell something?Are you salivating?How do you feel about putting this food into your body right now?How does your body feel anticipating eating in this moment?Now we are going to receive this food into our body. Be aware of our arm movingto your mouth.How is the grape taken into the mouth? Experience the food in your mouth. Chew slowlyand focus your full attention on the food's taste and texture.Be aware of any desire you have to rush through this grape so that you can haveanother.Be aware of the intention to swallow before you actually swallow.Notice how far into your body you can still feel the grape.

First is a description of the evidence-based medicine (EBM) component of a fourth year elective offered at Duke. Second is an excerpt froma text on CAM, edited by Jonas and Levin that offers a set of case studies to illustrate the applicationsof the principles of EBM in clinical practice.Part I: Duke EBM moduleUnit MD Director, Duke Center for Integrative MedicineLarry Burk, MD Education Director, Duke Center for Integrative Medicine Course Director Duke University School of Medicine Durham, NCIntegrative Medicine competencies addressed (see Section 2, list of competencies):Knowledge 4, 8, 9, 10Attitudes 4Skills 5Course Goals (overall course):To apply evidence-based (E-B) principles to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)To improve communication with patients about CAM issuesTo promote self-care among students through experience of CAM practicesObjectives (Evidence-based course component only):Cite at least one randomized controlled trial for each of the nine different CAM topicspresented in the course.Critique in detail the scientific merit of at least one research article on a CAM topic.Identify credible sources of information about CAM from the literature and the Internet.Curriculum component:ElectiveTarget audience:M4 StudentsLimited to 10 students per sessionOpen to Physician Assistant and Physical Therapy studentsDuke CAM and Evidence-based Medicine CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 164Duration:4-week course, 40 hours/weekOffered once per yearLearning Methods: Formal lectures, slides (20%) Group discussion (30%) presentations (10%) Experiential learning, fieldwork, office visits (40%)Faculty resources: 2 course faculty12 medical clinical faculty 10 CAM professionals participate4 present didactic information6 host visiting studentsDescriptionThis elective is designed to provide students with an evidence-based and experientialunderstanding of integrative medicine. This curriculum module will only discuss the Evidence-basedMedicine component of this course. Throughout the course, faculty members, including four CAMprofessionals, provide a series of one-hour evidence-based presentations on nine topics, including areview of the literature. Following each session, an assigned student presents a critique of thatsubject's best available randomized controlled trial. Critical thinking is encouraged during thissystematic review of various CAM modalities and research. Acupuncture, herbal medicine, nutritionalsupplements, probiotics, massage, manipulation, hypnosis, meditation, and women's health areconsidered. Students have the opportunity to assess the extent to which the scientific evidence hasimpact on the manner in which the CAM techniques are applied in practice.Students receive an extensive syllabus that includes a list of readings, websites, educationalgoals, introductory materials on the topics provided, and a schedule of activities for the four-weekcourse. Beyond the Evidenced-based Medicine component, students prepare presentations on clinicalexperiences, learn from Web-based instructional quizzes, work through cases, participate in field visitsto observe CAM practitioners, and experience self-care training during this four-week course. Duringthe final week, students create and present a treatment plan for a chosen disease process, integratingall appropriate CAM modalities.Discussion questions:What are the side-effects and hazards associated with the most common CAM practices?What are the training and credentialing requirements of CAM practitioners?Reflection questions:What is the advantage to understanding EBM in relation to CAM modalities?How is this approach to evaluating CAM modalities different from your previous experiencewith E-B traditional Western medicine practice?In what way do your beliefs on the CAM efficacy trials affect your willingness to listen to apatient's story?In what way will your approach to patients change after this experience?Resource materials:Attached with course session materialsDuke CAM and Evidence-based Medicine CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 165Evaluation strategies:Students are evaluated on the critique of a journal research article during the Evidence-Basedsessions (20%), E-B PowerPoint disease process presentation (20%), a presentation and writtensummary regarding personal experiences with CAM practitioners (20%), other topical presentations(20%), and a final web-based examination focused on CAM practitioner qualifications and safetyissues (20%).Student evaluations:Students evaluate the course qualitatively by writing short paragraphs about their experienceswith various topics and practitioners. They also make short oral presentations at the end of the courseabout their most beneficial and least beneficial experiences. Students evaluate the electivequantitatively using three 10-point questionnaires.Challenges to presenting this unit:Initially there were difficulties getting the course approved by the curriculum committee.Some difficulties lie in positioning the course during the fourth year at an optimum time for thematch and after interviewing trips.Duke CAM and Evidence-based Medicine CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 166CONTRIBUTED CURRICULUM MATERIALSCourse schedule provided below as an example of how teaching on EBM can be incorporated into anintegrative medicine elective experience.

Lippincott, Philadelphia, Pa, 1999.Summary of StepsStep 1Is the patient already using or wanting to use a CAM approach, or is analternative sought?Step 2Is the practice inexpensive and unlikely to produce direct (toxic) adverse effects?Step 3Is there evidence for this practice from randomized controlled trials orobservational and outcome studies?Step 4Does the quality of the studies meet the minimum quality criteria?Step 5Is the population in these studies similar to the patient at hand?Step 6Is the belief and rationale for the therapy acceptable to both patient andphysician?Step 7If Yes to all the above, consider a therapeutic trial provided:A) A quality product or procedure by a competent practitioner can be obtained,andB) The patient can be monitored while undergoing the treatment.Step 8Also consider if a new diagnostic assessment by a CAM system is in order.By following these steps, the physician can increase the likelihood that decisions about CAM practiceare based on research evidence; or, if there is no research evidence, the practitioner can be clear thatclinical decisions are based on other criteria (e.g., opinion, clinical judgment).Examples of Evidence-Based Approaches to CAMThe following case examples help illustrate the use of an evidence-based approach.Case 1: AllergiesA 23-year-old woman comes to her practitioner for the treatment of seasonal allergies. She is in goodhealth and has normally taken standard antihistamines and decongestants for her condition.However, these agents make her sleepy, so when she came across a homeopathic allergy remedy in thedrug store, she tried it for several days. It seemed to help.Step 1. Now she would like your opinion on whether she should continue with thispreparation.Steps 2 and 7A. The product is a combination of very low doses of plant substances and issaid to be manufactured according to the standards of the United States HomeopathicPharmacopoeia\u2014a product for which the Food and Drug Administration does provide some insight.Step 3. A search of the available databases comes up with two meta-analyses of randomizedcontrolled trials and several other randomized controlled trials on the treatment of allergies withhomeopathic preparations.1,2The effect size for these studies shows that approximately 75% of patients will experienceclinically significant relief, but the preparations in the studies are not exactly the same as the ones inthe product she has found. No significant adverse effects have been reported from these dilutions, norare any expected given the extremely low dose.Jonas and Levin CAM and Evidence-based Medicine CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 170Step 4. A review of two controlled trials with the minimum quality criteria mentioned earlierin the chapter shows that these studies meet these standards.Step 5. The populations in the studies are varied enough to be similar to the patient'ssituation.Step 7B. The patient is very happy to have the physician monitor the treatment and switchback to conventional treatment if the alternative proves inadequate.Step 6. However, the physician believes that the plausibility of homeopathy's effect is veryunlikely. Thus, all of the steps in establishing the evidence criteria are fulfilled except step 6(plausibility), with some disparity of belief between the patient and practitioner. In addition, theproduct is not exactly the same as that studied, so there is no direct evidence for this exact product onthis condition. The physician must then decide with the patient the proper course of action (referral,limited therapeutic trial with reevaluation, etc.).Case 2: DepressionA 45-year-old woman suffering from depression in combination with a dependent-depressivepersonality disorder seeks help, primarily psychotherapy. History reveals a series of losses in her past:her grandmother, who was very kind and important to her, had died when she was five. Her father,whom she admired and who doted on her, died when she was 12. From the time her father died, shehad taken on considerable responsibility for herself and her younger sister. When she was in herteenage years, she started dating a young man from her neighborhood with whom she fell in love.Because he was a Protestant and she was a Catholic, a relationship seemed impossible, given thestrong religious background of both families. After several years, the young man was diagnosed withleukemia and soon died. This was the same disease the patient's father had died of. Shortlyafterward, she married a close friend of her deceased boyfriend who courted her but whom she did notreally love. Recently, a good friend of hers had committed suicide, which started the patient's suicidalimpulses and brought her to therapy. From reading popular books she had taken a fancy forhomeopathy and inquired whether her problems could benefit from homeopathic remedies.Step 1. Under no circumstances is the patient willing to take any conventional psychotropicmedicine or consider seeing a psychiatrist. Verbal psychotherapy in a general psychodynamicframework with behavioral elements is initiated, but the patient persistently requests homeopathictreatment.Step 2. The risk of adverse effects is low if the treatment is embedded in a generalpsychotherapeutic environment in which the patient is not alone with her experiences. If such apatient is left unmonitored with only CAM intervention, this approach would be very risky. Directrisk of adverse effects in this situation is low and costs are negligible, but refusal of potentiallyeffective conventional treatment by the patient is of concern.Step 3. There is no evidence from clinical trials or observational studies about theeffectiveness of homeopathy in depression. One could consider the herb Hypericum (St John's wort), aphytotherapeutic alternative that has been studied and seems to be effective as a mild antidepressive,but this is also for mild depression. It is also doubtful whether Hypericum alone is sufficient becauseit is used only for mild depression. The patient has been reading case histories in the homeopathicliterature about positive effects of homeopathic treatment in depression. She thinks that her casewould be clear to a homeopath because of depression and sadness after multiple losses, which shethinks is a key homeopathic diagnostic symptom.Step 4. The evidence for a homeopathic intervention is weak. There are no trials and noformal observational studies, only single observations and case reports that are very likely due toplacebo and nonspecific effects\u2014something to which depression often responds.Step 5. It is difficult to say whether the people reported on in the case studies the patientreads are comparable with the patient here. Usually, there is not enough information in the casestudies to make a determination.Step 6. The evidence certainly is not enough for relying solely on a homeopathicintervention. Given the patient's refusal of other therapies and her high belief in the system,Jonas and Levin CAM and Evidence-based Medicine CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 171nonspecific effects might be enhanced if a confident practitioner is found and careful follow-up withpsychotherapy is maintained.Step 7. There is no way of starting a therapeutic trial unless a responsible homeopathicpractitioner is found, is willing to work with the physician, and uses standard homeopathic productsoverseen by the FDA. The physician also might consider this patient noncompliant and refuse furthertherapy. However, given the patient's propensity for alternative medicine, this may place the patientat increased risk (albeit of her own choosing).Step 8. The diagnosis is clear. If the patient is refusing psychotropic medication (which shedoes), psychotherapy is the only alternative left. If the circumstances in step 7 for referral and follow-up exist, it is possible that additional benefit from adding a therapeutic trial of homeopathy mayoccur.Follow-up: A homeopathic treatment is initiated parallel to continuous psychotherapy. Overthe course of one year, this brought out a variety of destructive impulses, sadness andmourning\u2014feelings she had not allowed herself before. In the course of this treatment, thehomeopathic practitioner says that a decisive homeopathic symptom surfaces. The patient relates thesingle fear she is most afraid of\u2014losing her financial and economic security and becoming poor.However, this fear is irrational (the family is quite rich), and is correlated as a key symptom to thehomeopathic remedy Aurum, made from gold. Homeopathic treatment is initiated and gradually thepatient loses her self-hate and self-destructive impulses. Psychotherapy seems to progress better.When therapy was terminated, the patient said that her major gain was that she could never think ofharming herself any more.It is not clear in this case whether homeopathy itself was helpful. Subjectively it was, but itis doubtful whether the effect would have been visible without ongoing psychotherapy. Certainly, theevidence for a homeopathic treatment alone was weak and the decision to proceed was notdetermined by convincing evidence. If the prior probability (step 6) had been low either on the side ofthe patient or on the side of the therapist, proceeding with CAM therapy could not be recommended.Had the prior probability been low on the side of the patient, homeopathy or any alternativetreatment could have sustained a false hope, diverting the patient from the need to seek definitivetreatment. If the prior probability had been low on the side of the therapist, it is doubtful whether heor she could have integrated both perspectives, which again could interfere with an effectivetherapeutic process.Case 3: Smoking CessationA 32-year-old woman who has smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 15 years saw anadvertisement for a smoking cessation clinic that used acupuncture. She comes to her physician'soffice seeking advice about this program, which claims to have great results. When she visited thesmoking cessation clinic, there was a single practitioner with an acupuncture degree from aMidwestern institution. The practitioner claimed that lots of research proved that acupuncture ishighly effective in helping people stop smoking. The practitioner gave the patient some articles\u2014arandomized controlled trial written up in an Italian cardiology journal claiming 60% effectiveness,and a French article showing that acupuncture was effective in helping to stop smoking.3 He said thatin his clinical experience, 80% of people that he treated were able to stop smoking.The treatment consists of ear acupuncture three times a week for two months, followed by asingle monthly treatment for one year. Also, a small \"acu-ball\" is taped to points on the patient's earfor several hours daily. The cost is $35 per visit (plus $5 for the \"acu-ball\"). The practitioner requeststwo months' payment at the start, yet gives a discount if it is all paid up front ($240 at the firstsession for eight sessions). He said this prepayment helps patients become motivated to complete thefirst eight treatments. The patient would like to try this treatment because she really wants to stopsmoking and has failed at previous attempts. She has tried smoking cessation classes and nicotinegum, but her nonsmoking status lasted only a few days or weeks. She is enthusiastic about theacupuncture and feels it may help her. However, before spending the money, she wanted to know ifher physician thought it was a good idea.Jonas and Levin CAM and Evidence-based Medicine CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 172Step 1. The patient really wants to try acupuncture. She has tried smoking cessation classesand nicotine gum and classes without success. She wants to have a baby and stop smoking before shebecomes pregnant.Step 2. If properly delivered with disposable needles, ear acupuncture is unlikely to produceserious side effects. The cost is considerable, but so is continuing to smoke.Step 3. Her physician offers to search the literature. He logs onto the Internet and goes tothe Cochrane Database of Clinical Trials in Complementary Medicine (available free on the Web pageof the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine). Using the key words\"smoking\" and \"acupuncture,\" he finds 27 controlled trials and one systematic review.4Step 4. The systematic review (published in 1990) is a criteria-based quality review of 15trials. The review reports that the vast majority of these trials were small, of poor quality, andreported negative results. The French study provided by the acupuncturist was also online and,although it reports positive effects from acupuncture, it received a very poor score in the systematicreview. A more recent study (1997) evaluated smoking cessation rates in groups given acupuncture,nicotine gum, both, or neither. About 6% remained off tobacco at four years, with no differencebetween any treatment.5Steps 5 through 9 are unnecessary because the current best evidence indicates thatacupuncture is no more effective than placebo or nicotine gum for smoking cessation. The patientshould be informed that using the acupuncture for this purpose may be a waste of time and money.Once the patient's initial enthusiasm for the acupuncture treatments has subsided, a relapse tosmoking is highly probable. Provided the acupuncture is delivered in a proper manner with sterileneedles, the patient's main risk is the cost and time of the treatments, as well as potential resignationfrom future attempts at smoking cessation should she return to smoking. This might prevent her fromenrolling in a comprehensive smoking cessation program, which may increase her chances of successin smoking cessation. Thus, an additional risk of acupuncture in this case is substituting ineffectivetherapy for possible effective therapy.References:1. Linde K, Clausius N, Ramirez G, et al.

This session is designed to reinforce approaches to patient beliefs and interviewingskills introduced in the first-year course and a family interview practice session held earlier in theUTMB-Galveston Case Study: CAM and Cross-Cultural Issues CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 174second year. It is conducted in an interactive lecture format, and includes a simulated familyinterview. Prior to the lecture, students are informed that that they will be observing a physician asshe conducts a family interview and they are given the background of the medical case. The case ismodified from the book The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down by Anne Fadiman.Introductory comments in this session address the overlap of the provider's culture and theculture of biomedicine and encourage investigation into patients' social, cultural and spiritual beliefsrelating to health care. Students are introduced to a live \"standardized family\"\u2014people who completetraining to portray assigned roles and to give scripted response to questions. The physician modelsthe interview process utilizing an eight-question interview format originally proposed by ArthurKleinman, MD, from Harvard Medical School. Students review the case and questions prior to theinterview. After students listen to the simulated live interview, they are encouraged to ask the\"family\" further questions. Faculty facilitates a discussion between the students and family.Students are directed to a variety of reinforcement materials on the course website (listedbelow in Resources). The Website includes, an extensive syllabus with a list of readings and anannotated bibliography, other resource Websites, introductory materials on the topics provided, andcases and discussion questions.Sample Discussion Questions:When is it appropriate to call a conference of a family to discuss a medical concern? In whatother situations would a family conference be appropriate?What did you learn from asking the family to define the type of treatment the family shouldreceive?Why is it important to include issues related to culture and spirituality in dialogue withpatients?Suggested Reflection Questions:What did you learn from this case? What surprised you?What are the advantages to understanding the cultural influences that guide decisions withina family?In what ways do your beliefs affect your willingness to listen to a patient's story?In what ways will your approach to patients change after this experience?Resource Material:1.

A faculty member writes four to five test questions pertaining this session that areincorporated into the Practice of Medicine course exams. Half of the questions are used for apractice test, and the remaining questions are used for the final exam two weeks later2. A sample of students completes a session evaluation at the end of the session.3. Students provide ratings of the module at the end of the course as well.Student evaluation:Over the past five years, student feedback has been very positive by most students. Theyreport that including such experiences broadens the humanizing elements of medicine. A smallernumber of students comment that they do not see this topic as relevant to medicine.Unique Implementation Challenges:Initially, finding time in the curriculum was the biggest challenge.Standardized Patient Training\u2014costly, labor intensive.UTMB-Galveston Case Study: CAM and Cross-Cultural Issues CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 175CONTRIBUTED CURRICULUM MATERIALSCaseInterview Questions and ResponsesEvaluation QuestionsUTMB-Galveston Case Study: CAM and Cross-Cultural Issues CAHCIM for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 176CASE STUDYCase Study:In this case, the child is an Hispanic infant (Leah) who suffered the same fate as Lia (in The SpiritCatches You and You Fall Down, by Anne Fadiman. She was born at Thomason Hospital in El Pasoand later brought to the Houston area by her parents.At three months, the child developed seizures, which have progressed over the past three years. Shehas become neurologically devastated by them. Despite multiple medications and extensive work-up,the girl continues to do poorly with recurrent seizures. A large part of the problem was the parents'inability to communicate effectively with the healthcare providers about their beliefs about Leah'sproblem.Questions in italics are the Eight Questions proposed by Kleinman.1. What do you call the problem?Father: \"Susto\"2. What do you think has caused the problem?Mother: \"She was frightened and part of her soul left.\"3. Why do you think it started when it did?Mother: \"Leah's sister, Yerlinda, slammed the door real hard one day and frightened partof Leah's soul away.\"4. What do you think the sickness does? How does it work?Mother: \"It makes Leah shake and fall down.\"5. How severe is the sickness? Will it have a short or long course?Father: \"Why are you asking us those questions? If you are a good doctor, you shouldknow the answers yourself.\"6. What kind of treatment do you think the patient should receive? What are the mostimportant results you hope she receives from this treatment?Father: \"You should give Leah medicine to take for a week, but no longer. After she iswell, she should stop taking the medicine. You should not treat her by taking her blood orfluid from her backbone. Leah should also be treated at home with our curandero'smedicines. Our curandero will heal Leah. She needs brushings, limpias with a raw egg,candles to be burned, special herbs waved over her in a smoke and also to drink in teas.\"7. What are the chief problems the sickness has caused?Mother: \"It has made us sad to see Leah hurt, and it has made us angry with her sister,Yerlinda.\"8. What do you fear most about the sickness?Mother: \"That Leah's soul will never return.\"UTMB-Galveston Case Study: CAM and Cross-Cultural Issues CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 177SAMPLE EXAM QUESTIONSCULTURAL COMPETENCY QUESTIONS FOR POM IIYou are seeing a Chinese woman in whom you have just diagnosed cancer.

Didactic sessions includecritical analysis of scientific evidence, controversies in CAM and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)research methodology, placebo phenomenon, and the economical, ethical, legal, and practical aspectsof integrating CAM into the conventional healthcare system. TCM is used as the main example ofCAM, with emphasis placed on acupuncture and acupressure. Comparisons of the two approaches ofmedicine provide a forum for learning the historical, cultural, and philosophical approaches tomedicine. At the end of the course, students make presentations on a research topic of their choice onEast-West medicine.Patient treatment cases are used in clinic to illustrate the many ways to integrate TCM intothe patient's health care. Students observe practicing providers as they work in a high volumeoutpatient clinic that combines Chinese medicine and conventional medicine. Patient interviews, eachstudent seeing up to eight patients per day, are followed by a student/faculty discussion of the patienthistory, diagnosis, and treatment plan.Students serve as practice patients to other students as they learn interviewing, diagnosticskills, and develop clinical practice skills. In practicing with other students, they experience thetreatments of therapeutic massage, acupuncture, dietary advice, qi gong, and trigger point injection.After observing providers and practicing on other students, they then apply these skills to patientsunder the supervision of faculty. Clinically based instruction provides the opportunity to discussclinical problem-solving, patient-oriented approaches to chronic and intractable symptoms, andculturally sensitive clinical practice issues.Further description of this educational program:*Hui K, Zylowska L, Hui E, Liang J, Li JJ.

(New information, behavior, acknowledgment of behavior)What do you want to remember from this encounter/experience?What will you do differently, in patient interviews or symptom review, after learning about herbalmedicine?Resource Material:Course syllabus with additional handouts and computer-generated medical literatureEvaluation strategies:1. All course faculty rate students on the standard student rotation evaluation for thecompetencies listed for this course. Students are also evaluated on participation in didacticsessions, class discussions, case studies, and practical demonstrations. These and the finalresearch topic presentation are evaluated on an equal basis.2. Faculty provide daily feedback to students during clinical interactions.3. A self-assessment is completed by students to assess achievements on each of the learningobjectives.Student evaluations:Students evaluate the clerkship and teaching of clinical faculty at the end of the advancedclerkship. Ratings and comments are overwhelmingly positive, and this course has been rated amongthe best in the medical school. Students report a deeper connection and renewed passion formedicine, and they have referred other students to the course.Overall course and self-evaluations show that the course is effective in aiding students in thefollowing, as reported in Hui K et al 2002* (see reference above):1. appreciation of health and disease in general,2. enhanced perspective on biomedical and CAM treatment approaches,3. basic knowledge of the philosophy and theoretical underpinnings of TCM,4. appreciation and assessment of the validity of research evidence available on TCM,5. exposure to the conceptual principles and scientific basis of integrative East-Westmedicine,6. appreciation of ways to integrate TCM into the conventional medical system, and7. comfort with selected wellness-promoting clinical skills.Unique Implementation Challenges: Translation of the paradigm differences between Western (linear and reductionistic) and Easternmedicine (circular and systemic) is compromised due to the limited amount of basic and clinicalresearch studies in TCM translated into English. Inadequate TCM teaching materials and texts havebeen written for biomedically trained individuals, so these materials lack the use of scientificlanguage. Availability of Chinese medical providers and faculty skills in TCM is essential. While access toa Chinese patient population makes this elective unique, this model can be adapted for use with otherpatient populations.UCLA Fourth Year CAM Clinical Elective CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 182CONTRIBUTED CURRICULUM MATERIALSDescription of daily course content and activitiesCase study presentationUCLA Fourth Year CAM Clinical Elective CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 183COURSE CONTENT AND OVERVIEWCourse Content and Overview:Didactic\u201440 percent.Students are asked to respond to presented materials.

The interview is followed by a discussion of thepatient history, diagnosis, and treatment plan. Demonstrations/Hands-On - 10 percentStudents review and practice the Integrative Medicine interview, which emphasizes the patient'sresponses about symptoms and incapacities, and the physical, emotional, social, nutritional, andenvironmental factors that weaken a person's reserve to maintain homeostasis. To reinforce skillsdevelopment, volunteers from non-Western cultures are interviewed by students, providing personalexperiences as case studies. Students then develop and discuss a self-care plan with the volunteer. (Acase is provided below to illustrate this process)Students observe the staff acupuncturists as they perform therapeutic massage and acupuncture onstudent volunteers, followed by practice sessions in acupuncture to learn a few basic acupuncturepoints.Students are given the opportunity to handle and smell preparations of commonly used herbs, andlater to visit a local TCM practitioner's herbal store.Students may participate in daily TCM relaxation/rebalancing techniques such as t'ai chi and qi gong.Clinical Observation and Direct Patient Contact - 15%Selected patients meet with students to share their medical histories, including experiences with manyconventional physicians, diagnoses, and therapeutic procedures received. The patient's summary ofconventional approaches is followed by presentation of diagnosis and treatment from the TCMUCLA Fourth Year CAM Clinical Elective CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 184perspective. Aspects of diagnosis using information not gathered from the conventional review ofsystems, such as tongue inspection, trigger and acupoint examination, and interview questions suchas taste preferences are introduced or reviewed. Students consider the usefulness of TCM in providinga diagnosis and treatment options that might not be considered using conventional medicine alone,thus encouraging integration of the two healing traditions in clinical practice.Student Presentations - 15 %Students are asked to research and prepare a presentation on a topic of their choice for presentationon the final day of the course.

On further history, shefirst noted her symptoms during a time of intense stress while she was visiting her parents. Thepatient was near completion of her undergraduate medical education program, and she described hermother as nonsupportive of her chosen residency program. At that time, she frequently argued withher mother, worried about her parents' marital problems, and ended a relationship with her boyfriend.Since the onset of her symptoms, she had increasing pain, which was exacerbated by stress. She hadsome relief with professional massage, self-massage and application of local heat. On review ofsymptoms, she noted decreased energy. She had frequent cold extremities and said she preferred warmclimates. She reported having difficulty sleeping. She reported chronic dry eyes. She had experienceddyspepsia with associated bloating and cramping twice a week and took antacid tablets for thesymptoms. She sporadically takes Metamucil and has symptoms of constipation if she does notremember to take it. She has two roommates and gets along with them well. She exercises frequently,which includes lifting weights above her head.On exam, she had a normal sized thyroid. Bilateral cervical and thoracic muscles were tender topalpation, and multiple associated trigger points were noted. She had a prominent left trapeziusmuscle. The exam was otherwise negative. A Traditional Chinese Medicine exam included anexamination of tongue and pulse. The body of the tongue was slightly puffy with teeth marks. Thecolor was dusky, and there was a thin, white coat on the tongue. The right radial pulse was wiry andthe left radial pulse was slippery. The patient was taking no pain medication.Faculty-guided student discussion:The patient's problem list included myofascial neck pain, dyspnea, stress, cold intolerance, stress, dryeyes, and insomnia. Review of the differential diagnosis of each of these symptoms and issues anddiscussion of current guidelines on the diagnosis and evidence based clinical management of theseconditions brought the conclusion that the patient's symptoms did not represent a serious diseaseprocess. The Western paradigms could not offer a diagnosis for her seemingly disparate collection offunctional symptoms. There was no evidence-based approach to managing the patient with thismyriad of conditions that are often seen in clinical practice. Concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicinehelped to explain how stress, sleep problems, and physical trauma from overloading exercises depletedher body's reserve of energy and caused dysfunction of her mind-body-spirit system. Anger in thispatient led to intense muscle spasm that affected the neck, shoulders, and upper back, which mayhave contributed to her many other symptoms. Myofascial trigger points as an etiology of manyfunctional and pain syndromes has been underemphasized in conventional medical education, and thehands-on approach that is required to diagnose and treat myofascial pain has not been part of thestudents' clinical skills. Faculty presented myofascial pain as a marker that the body was havingdifficulty regulating itself and that treating myofascial pain could improve symptoms and decreaserisk for further dysfunction. Faculty emphasize the integration of conventional Western and TCM todiagnose disease without delay, to prevent dangerous interactions between herbs and drugs, and toprevent further disregulation that can develop into more serious diseases. The model emphasizes adoctor-patient relationship, with physician serving as a teacher to the patient. By teaching self-care,responsibility for health moves from the physician's office to the patient, and the patient isempowered with autonomy and greater control over his or her health.Recommended treatment approach:The treatment approach combined the best of Western medicine and TCM to solve this patient'sproblem. The plan consisted of trigger point injections, massage, and acupuncture treatments. A careUCLA Fourth Year CAM Clinical Elective CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 186plan was devised for the patient that included self-massage of acupressure points, appropriate exercisewithout overloading, proper diet, good sleeping habits, and yoga.The treatment plan included a consideration for prescribing a low dose of flexeril at bedtime, orconsideration of Chinese herbal medicines if symptoms persisted.Student activities:The mechanisms of action of these different treatments (trigger point injections, massage, andacupuncture) and the evidence base were reviewed. Students participated in performing andreceiving acupuncture and massage. The theoretical basis behind Chinese herbal therapeutics,mechanisms of action of single herbs, the efficacy of herbs to treat different problems presented,regulatory issues of herbal supplements, problems with quality control, and the potential for drug-herbal interactions were discussed.Students worked as a group to devise a care plan for the patient, based on the symptoms presented.They also devised their own self-care plans after developing the plan for the patient.UCSF Experiential Unit: The Healer's Art CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 187THE CARE OF THE SOUL:SERVICE AS A WAY OF LIFE________________________________________________MODULE DESCRIPTIONUnit Contributed by:Rachel Naomi Remen, MD Clinical Professor, Family and Community Medicine University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine San Francisco, CA Director, Institute for the Study of Health and Illness at Commonweal, Bolinas CaliforniaIntegrative Medicine competencies addressed: (see Section 2, list of competencies)Values 1-9Attitude 1Goals:To make visible the commitment to service that underlies scientific medicine.To formulate a personal commitment to medicine.To make a personal commitment visible among peers.To legitimize openness and dialogue with colleagues and patients in the area of service,calling and mission.To personally relate to the core values of compassion, service, harmlessness, courage,love and reverence for life.To evoke and make visible the heart and spirit of medicine.To experience the Hippocratic Oath as a way of life and a lineage.Objectives:Students will be able to:1. Reconnect to their personal commitment and the purpose of their work.2. Rewrite the Hippocratic Oath for themselves.3. Speak their commitment to medicine aloud to their colleagues.4. Recognize themselves as part of a committed service community.5. Recognize that depth of commitment is independent of expertise.6. Recognize the importance of preserving their commitment and sense of meaning of thework.7. Witness the unity of commitment to service that lies beneath the diversity of expertiseand experience.8. Reframe their ideas of service; recognize meaning as the antecedent of commitment.9. Validate their personal dreams of service through medicineCurriculum Component:ElectivePrimary Target audience:M1 and M2 students and Medical FacultyUCSF Experiential Unit: The Healer's Art CAHCIM Implementation Learning Methods employed: Large group instruction Experiential and discovery model learning Reflection and contemplation Expressive Techniques: writingFaculty Resources:1 course director Description:\"The Care of the Soul,\" is the final session of the Healer's Art course, founded at UCSF 12years ago and taught at 23 medical schools by the close of 2003. This session uses anexperiential learning approach to explore the concepts of service, mission and calling,legitimizing dialogue and openness among professional peers in an area not usually discussed inmedical education.This session lasts two hours. During the first half-hour the course director begins thesession by offering some personal thoughts on the idea of service, calling, and commitment, andthe importance of preserving a sense of personal meaning in the practice of medicine. Service isdefined not as a technique but as a relationship and a way of life, and is distinguished fromhelping and fixing others. The course director suggests that those attracted to service often movetowards situations that others avoid because something in their nature causes them to want to bewith others at such times. Students and faculty are asked to respond to the question, \"When didyou first know that service was your way of life?\" and asked to raise their hands. \"How manywere between 20 and 25 years old? How many were between 15 and 20? Between 10 and 15?How many were younger than 10? Usually a third or more of each class was younger than 10 andmore than half of the class was younger than 15. Students report that this realization is one of themore powerful understandings they have had about themselves and about the nature of medicine.Students are then asked to reflect and remember and share stories of service from their ownchildhood, times they served others when they were small. Students are enabled to recognize thatthey can heal with their humanity even when they cannot cure with their science and that theirmedical training is simply an extension of something they have been involved in for many years.Using a simple and accessible technique, the students and the faculty are thenencouraged to express their individual dreams of service by writing a personal Hippocratic Oathor mission statement. Then both students and the faculty are invited to read these personalstatements aloud for 30- 45 minutes, making visible the network of commitment and humancaring that underlies the highly technical practice of medicine. Often, the chaplaincy studentsand director of the UCSF hospital chaplaincy training program will audit this session and writetheir personal statements of commitment to their service work and share in the reading.The exercise makes visible the shared commitment to serve that lies hidden below thedivisiveness of expertise; it is often not possible to tell by simply listening if the person readingis a student, an oncologist or an internist, or a rabbi, minister, or priest.The power of this exercise to form a community of service and inspire students andfaculty cannot be easily described. In this simple way, we all make visible and witness togetherthe commitments upon which the future of medicine as a profession may depend. The readingUCSF Experiential Unit: The Healer's Art CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 189may be followed by a general discussion seeded by specific questions. The course ends with a fewmoments of silence in which we each wish all present the fulfillment of their dream of service.Discussion questions: See belowReflection questions: See belowResource HerriotTuesdays with Morrie Mitch AlbomKitchen Table Wisdom: Stories that Heal Rachel Naomi Remen, MD Wounded HealersThe Compassionate Caregiver: a guidebook Jeffrey Kane on healing relationshipsThe Healer's Art Reader: A Collection of relevant articles from the medical andpublic literature2. Course Website: www.meaninginmedicine.org (Finding Meaning in Medicine website) with extensive Bibliographies availableEvaluation strategies:1. Self-assessment of growth and change through discussion and journaling2. A standard Healer's Art evaluation form and self-report is completed by both students andfaculty.Student evaluations:This unit has been evaluated as part of the overall evaluation process for the Healer's Artelective. A student advisory group of five to seven students, faculty, and the course director evaluatethe course on an annual basis. Each year's course design builds on student evaluations and feedbackfrom the previous year. Changes may be implemented as the course is in progress, based on studentadvisor feedback. Since the beginning of the program in 1992, evaluations have shown that theprocesses used encourage respect for differences, self-exploration and self trust, and allows forpersonal ownership of the fundamental principles of healing and healing relationship.Nearly half of the first-year students enroll in this elective at UCSF. Students value the smallgroup experience highly and describe the Healer's Art small groups as radically different from theirother small groups and study groups. Student groups often continue to meet on their own to offercontinuing support after the course has ended, drawing on the leaderless small group \"FindingMeaning in Medicine\" process described on the Website.Similar Courses at Other Schools:The course from which this module is taken has been successfully replicated by deans andfaculty at 23 schools nationwide. Nationwide valuations of the course are uniformly outstandingdespite wide differences in regional cultures. Faculty as well as students describe experience of thecourse as unique within their professional training.UCSF Experiential Unit: The Healer's Art CAHCIM Implementation in Integrative Medicine 190CONTRIBUTED CURRICULUM MATERIALSAn experiential exercise from one of the experiential modules from The Healer's Art course.Although it is a part of the fifth session of the course, it can also be free standing and can beincorporated into any course for all four years of students or can be used as a foundation for a twohour seminar and discussion on service values. In addition to its use in The Healer's Art since 1992, ithas been used as an independent seminar for thousands of students residents and/or physician groupsacross the country. It is simple to implement and is invariably evaluated highly by participants. Note: This exercise may be conducted in any size of group, from five to 200 participants, with anylevel of student, resident, physician, faculty member, or any group that is committed to a healingmission.UCSF Experiential Unit: The Healer's Art CAHCIM Implementation Guide for in Integrative Medicine 191EXERCISE: WRITING A PERSONAL HIPPOCRATIC OATHThis exercise has been done with medical students in The Healer's Art since 1992 as well as withresidents and physician groups at many sites nationwide. It is a community-building exercise thatinitiates a discovery process into the personal and collective meaning of medicine and the nature ofservice.This simple and accessible technique enables participants to express their individual dream of serviceby rewriting a personal Hippocratic Oath in the form of a short poem. The study group then readswhat they have written aloud to each other, making visible the network of values, hopes and humancaring that underlies the highly technical practice of medicine. This is a very powerful session as theparticipants' statements, while highly individual, are also universal. In a multi-disciplinary group or agroup at varying levels of medical training, the exercise exposes the shared commitment to serve thatlies hidden beneath the divisiveness of our expertise.Start with a simple SHORT relaxation technique to enable people to focus on their reflection. Here isone that we have successfully used for a long time:Begin by suggesting that people put down whatever they are holding, close their eyes and relax.(Allow five seconds of silence.)Then say:Gently place your attention at the end of your out-breath each time you breathe (five seconds ofsilence)Notice the brief moment of stillness and peace that is there before you begin to breathe in. (Allowfive seconds of silence)We come to a place of rest five times every minute without really noticing.Allow yourself to be in this place of rest as fully as you can each time you arrive there. (Allowabout 20 seconds to pass.)Then suggest that participants reflect on the following question. (Say it slowly.)WHAT IF YOUR WORK DID NOT TELL YOU HOW TO LIVE?WHAT TO WEAR?WHAT LANGUAGE TO USE?HOW TO BEHAVE TOWARDS OTHERS?WHAT TO READ?WHEN TO EAT?OR HOW MUCH TO SLEEP?(Allow three seconds of silence)WHAT IF YOUR WORK WAS SIMPLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO EXPRESS YOUR HIGHESTVALUES INTO THIS WORLD?WHAT WOULD YOUR WORK LOOK LIKE THEN?(Allow three seconds of silence.)WHERE WOULD YOU BE DOING YOUR WORK? (two-second pause)WHAT WOULD YOUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH YOUR PATIENTS BE LIKE? (two-second pause)WHAT WOULD YOUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES BE LIKE? (two-second pause)WHAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT AND WHAT NOT SO IMPORTANT?(Allow a few moments of silence while people reflect.)TASK:UCSF Experiential Unit: The Healer's Art CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 192Now, ask for help in bringing this dream of service closer to your everyday work life.Write three or four sentences in the language of help, sentences that begin in one or more of thefollowing ways:Help me........Show me..........Strengthen me to........May I............Give me..........Enable me to......... ......or any such language form.Ask for help with the way that you want to be, what you want to do differently, and/or whatmight get in the way of being or doing this.(Allow 10 minutes for people to write. Watch your class, and see when most have stopped writing.)Then, the course director cana. suggest that people read what they have written aloud in a single large groupb. ask the group to divide itself into leaderless groups of six and read aloud to one another Whatever the size of the reading group, ask people to read what they have written ......wait threeseconds..., then read again so that everyone can really hear and take in what has been written.Suggest that the students listen GENEROUSLY to one another and simply hear and receive what issaid.The reading may go on for 45 minutes to an hour depending on the size of the reading group.Once the reading is over, the director leads a large-group discussion of all students.Reflection and Discussion:The director may make some comments or observations or by inviting some comments from theclass in response to the following questions:What surprised you about this exercise?What moved you about this exercise?What inspired you about this exercise?The director then asks people to make a copy of what they have written, and submit it\u2014signed orunsigned\u2014to be compiled and distributed to each student.If appropriate the director may close this session by asking for a moment of silence to allow the classto wish each other well in their dream of service. Challenges in Program Evaluation CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 193CHALLENGES IN PROGRAM EVALUATION Challenges in Program Evaluation CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 194 Challenges in Program Evaluation CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 195CHALLENGES IN PROGRAM EVALUATIONAs we have seen in this guide, many schools have implemented curricula that reflect aspectsof the Integrative Medicine competencies proposed by the Consortium. Evaluations of these effortsshow the diversity typical of educational assessments in medical education. Some courses (e.g., UCSF,Duke University, University of Minnesota) employ measures (i.e., rating scales) that reflect thestudent's level of satisfaction with the course content and faculty instruction. Some courses use focusgroups and questionnaires that contain open-ended questions and reflective essays to assess astudent's perception of impact (e.g., Duke, Georgetown, University of Michigan). A few units includeexam questions to assess knowledge, content, and clinical application (e.g. Jefferson Medical College,UTMB). Some courses include faculty ratings of student clinical performance (e.g. UCLA) and skill inproblem-based clinical applications (e.g., Harvard, UMDNJ). Two (University of Maryland and TempleUniversity) incorporate objective clinical performance assessments, using a standardized patient (SP).Few courses included multiple assessment tools.The evaluation methods described in these units were developed mainly to collect learners'evaluations of specific coursework or to permit faculty assessments of student learning in astandardized way. Strategies were typically part of an overall approach that evaluated attitudinalshifts, specific content acquisition, and skill development within the context of conventionalmedicine.Proceedings from a report of a 2002 national conference on curricular evaluation incomplementary, alternative, and integrative medicine demonstrate that many strategies used toevaluate Integrative Medicine in these new curriculum initiatives are at a very early stage. Many ofthe current strategies do not capture the development of more complex, problem-solving skills orgrowth leading to proficiency. The lack of attention to the development of comprehensive evaluationstrategies stems, in part, from the absence of articulated learner outcomes in integrative medicine aswell as medical educators' preoccupation with curricular development and implementation. Ideally,course and program evaluation strategies need to be linked to a broad set of competencies or expectedlearning outcomes appropriate for the level of learner. Similarly, consideration of learning outcomesshould be undertaken prior to the design and implementation of learning activities within acurriculum.As the social climate changes and patients clamor for integrative medicine therapies, medicaleducators are responding by giving greater attention to building and evaluating these skills in medicalstudents. Similar to other domains of traditional \"Western\" medical education, the design andimplementation of integrative medicine curricular activities and evaluation strategies have precededthe delineation and adoption of widely approved competencies. To date, a comprehensive approach todefining competencies in integrative medicine has not been described. Studies that focus on medicalprofessionalism have not investigated the developmental trajectory of physicians who practiceintegrative medicine or the attributes that would comprise their competency base. There have been nonational consensus panels that used assessment processes, such as the Delphi method, to createcompetency-based standards for integrative medicine. As a result, faculty and curriculum developershave been designing courses and embedding material within existing courses in the absence of anyclearly defined core competency standards. Only a small set of academic institutions have developedspecific learner outcomes in this area; fewer yet have attempted to address the full realm of complexcompetencies that represent the broad domain of integrative medicine.The proposed set of competency-based standards for integrative medicine, developed byconsensual agreement among CAHCIM members and presented in this curriculum guide, may lead theway for medical schools and academic institutions to incorporate these competencies into theirbroader set of mastery objectives. As such, it should encourage the rigorous design of newinstruments and processes to assess changes in medical students' knowledge base, clinicalperformance, or attitudes. Ultimately, these strategies to assess integrative medicine competencies Challenges in Program Evaluation CAHCIM Implementation Guide for Curriculum in Integrative Medicine 196would be embedded within each institution's existing evaluation framework, conveying to studentsand faculty alike the clear message of an integrated curriculum.Surveys that evaluate students' knowledge base and attitudes toward integrative medicine preand post-curriculum implementation may prove useful for assessing student competency and trackingstudent learning. A number of schools have designed surveys for this purpose and have begun toadminister them on yearly basis (e.g., University of Michigan). This longitudinal approach canconstitute a foundation for continued focused assessments and refinements of a more comprehensiveeducational program in integrative medicine.Two attitude assessment tools that have psychometric reliability and show promise forlongitudinal measurement of competency acquisition in integrative medicine are included in thissection. The IMAQ initially developed by Schneider to assess differences between holistic physiciansand conventional internists can be adapted for use at the undergraduate level. The APP-CAMdeveloped by Benn and her colleagues at the University of Michigan has been specifically designed tomeasure medical students' practice attitudes toward incorporation of complementary, alternative andallopathic medicine. The factor structure underlying this questionnaire explicitly addresses integrative,conventional, and relationship-focused dimensions and can be used to track both individual changesin a student's attitudes over time, and programmatic changes resulting from more comprehensiveinclusion of curriculum material related to integrative medicine.Specific integrative medicine assessment instruments (attitudinal or knowledge-based) areuseful for measuring learner outcomes. Assessment of specific courses or components in thecurriculum and associated learner outcomes for medical education in integrative medicine should,however, include a variety of evaluation tools and approaches. Ideally, the instruments used shouldhave rigorous, established criteria, such as appropriate design (e.g., time, length, unambiguousquestions, matching scales), and good psychometric properties (i.e., an assessment of the validity andreliability of scores from the instruments). In addition, they must be responsive to the specificquestions that need to be answered within a program or institutional context and assess elementsdesigned to meet specific competencies. In the proceedings of the 2002 national conference on CAMcurricular evaluation, Creswell1 suggests that the curriculum evaluation plans reflect not onlytraditional course measures (e.g., pre- and post-test multiple choice exams, objective performance-based assessments, graduation surveys), but also emerging means of learning in these educationalsettings. These methods might include, at different points across the four-year curriculum, the use of1) qualitative data collection consisting of personal narratives from participants (e.g., students,faculty, practitioners), 2) one-on-one interviews or focus groups (e.g., about beliefs with students,faculty), 3) multiple observations of student behaviors (e.g., with simulated patients or reactions tostandardized patients), and 4) student reflections captured in journals (e.g. in regard to patientencounters, problem-based learning scenarios, CAM providers, self-care practices).Measuring the foundation and patient interview skills that support development in integrativemedicine skills across the realm of medical school education requires not only a session and courseapproach, but also a broad program evaluation orientation. A recent report by the National Academyof Sciences2 suggests that three questions should guide any model of program evaluation: a) Whatoccurred?\u2014a qualitative description of the activity (e.g., curriculum course unit details), b) What werethe outcomes?\u2014a quantitative measure of the results (e.g., exam results, frequency behaviorchecklists), and c) What explains the outcomes - a qualitative assessment (e.g., interviews, journaling)of individuals who participated in the activity and can offer explanations for the results. Togetherwith conventional medical education evaluation measures, these qualitative approaches can contributeto not only evaluating student learning but also to understanding the processes that account forobserved effects. Applying a multimethod evaluation plan ultimately will enable faculty andcurriculum designers to revise content and activities in ways that better align integrative medicinecompetencies to student learning and learner outcomes.REFERENCES1 Proceedings of a Working Group on Evaluation of CAM Curricula, University of Michigan Complementary andAlternative Medicine Research Center, Ann Arbor MI 2003.2 National Research Council.
