How to select the right type of Palo Santo to buy Finding the right type of Palo Santo to buy can be a challenge, but it doesn't have to be. With a few simple tips and tricks, you can easily find the perfect palo santo for your spiritual practices. First off, [look for wood that is sustainably sourced](https://www.apothecarycompany.com/products/palo-santo-selenite-bundle) from either Peru or Ecuador; these are the two primary sources of Palo Santo in the world today. Some people claim that palo santo is close to extinction, but that is not entirely accurate. While some South American trees with the name palo santo are endangered, bursera graveoleon, the species usually referred to as palo santo, is ranked \"of least concern\" by the ICUCN. The ranking of ICUCN is based on global populations, and national governments are responsible for the conservation status of their respective regions. So a species can be considered endangered in one country but not in another, which is definitely another factor to consider. Secondly, make sure to select palo santo that is at least three years old - this ensures that it has been properly aged and will burn more slowly than younger cuts of wood. Finally, check out reviews online before purchasing any particular brand or type - this will help you get an idea of what others have experienced with their purchase so you know what to expect when using yours! The big takeaway is, again, to be very responsible about where you get your palo santo.
