JMIR Form Res ; 6(10): e39157, ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: [Coronavirus]continues to spread worldwide, causing various [health]and economic disruptions. One of the most important approaches to controlling the spread of this [disease]is to use an [artificial intelligence](AI)-based technological intervention, such as a chatbot system. Chatbots can [aid]in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE:This [paper]introduces COVID-Bot, an intelligent interactive system that can help screen [students]and confirm their COVID-19 [vaccination]status. METHODS:The design and development of COVID-Bot followed the principles of the design [science] [research](DSR) process, which is a [research] [method]for creating a new scientific [artifact]. COVID-Bot was developed implemented using the SnatchBot chatbot application [programming]interface ( [API]) and its predefined driven by various [natural language processing] [algorithms]. RESULTS:An evaluation was carried out through a [survey]that involved 106 [university] [students]in determining the functionality, compatibility, reliability, and usability of COVID-Bot. The findings indicated that 92 (86.8%) of the participants agreed that the chatbot functions well, 85 (80.2%) agreed that it fits well with their [mobile devices]and their [lifestyle], 86 (81.1%) agreed that it has the potential to produce accurate and consistent responses, and 85 (80.2%) agreed that it is easy to use. The average obtained was .87, indicating satisfactory reliability. CONCLUSIONS:This study demonstrates that incorporating chatbot [technology]into the educational system can combat the spread of COVID-19 among [university] [students]. The intelligent system does this by interacting their "}
