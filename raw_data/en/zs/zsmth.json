Fetal distress can sometimes happen during pregnancy, but it's more common [during labour](/labour-the-signs-and-stages). What causes fetal distress? Fetal distress may occur when the baby doesn't receive enough oxygen because of problems with the placenta (such as [placental abruption](/placental-abruption) or [placental insufficiency](/placental-insufficiency)) or problems with the umbilical cord (such as cord prolapse). It is more common if you are [overdue](/overdue), have pregnancy complications or when there are other [complications during labour](/labour-complications). Sometimes it happens because the [contractions](/giving-birth-contractions) are too strong or too close together. Your baby is more likely to experience fetal distress if: - you are obese - you have [high blood pressure in pregnancy](/high-blood-pressure-in-pregnancy)or [pre-eclampsia](/pre-eclampsia) - you have a chronic disease, such as diabetes, kidney disease or [cholestasis](/itching-during-pregnancy)(a condition that affects the liver in pregnancy) - you have a [multiple pregnancy](/twins) - your baby has fetal growth restriction How is fetal distress diagnosed? Fetal distress is diagnosed by [monitoring the baby's heart rate](/fetal-monitoring). A slow heart rate, or unusual patterns in the heart rate, may signal fetal distress. Your doctor or midwife might pick up signs of fetal distress as they listen to your baby's heart during pregnancy. Your [baby's movements](/baby-movements-during-pregnancy) are a sign that your baby is well. A change in your baby's movements may be a sign of fetal distress. If you haven't felt your baby move, or the pattern of moments has changed, contact your doctor or midwife immediately, as this may be a sign of fetal distress. Another sign of possible fetal distress is meconium in the amniotic fluid. Let your [doctor](/the-role-of-your-gp) or [midwife](/the-role-of-your-midwife) know right away if your notice your amniotic fluid is green or brown, since this could signal the presence of meconium (newborn poo, that your baby may pass while still in your uterus if they are distressed). How is fetal distress managed? There are a few ways that fetal distress may be managed. Your doctor will assess your situation and discuss with you the best management option in your situation. If you are not in labour Depending on your situation, your doctor or midwife may recommend interventions such as medicines or intravenous fluids. If these interventions do not help, your doctor may recommend an emergency caesarean section so you birth your baby quickly. If you are in labour You will usually be given you oxygen and fluids. Sometimes changing position, such as turning onto your side, can reduce the baby's distress. You may be given medicine to slow down the contractions. If you had medicines to speed up labour, these may be stopped if there are signs of fetal distress. Sometimes, a baby in fetal distress needs to be born quickly. Your doctor may recommend an [assisted (or instrumental) birth](/assisted-delivery-forceps-or-ventouse) or you might need to have an [emergency caesarean](/emergency-caesarean). Most of the time, there will be time to discuss your options with your doctor and/or midwife. However, in some emergency situations, your doctor or midwife will need to act quickly.

Fetal distress may require an [assisted birth](/assisted-delivery-forceps-or-ventouse) or [caesarean section](/caesarean). While these interventions are safe, they are associated with their own set of risks and complications.
