Free Wellness Consult - this is a great option for a new patient who has general questions about our services, or an existing patient looking for a few simple recommendations of products we carry. 2) 1 Hour Wellness Consultation - Initial Visit - for those looking for an in-depth look at their health and wanting a customized plan to meet their goals. We will review all systems of the body (digestion, energy, immune, reproductive, etc) and create an individualized plan with supplements, herbs, diet and lifestyle recommendations. 3) 30 Min Wellness Consult - Follow-Up - this is a follow-up appointment for existing patients to modify their plan and course-correct as needed. Herbal Medicine Chinese herbs are often used in conjunction with acupuncture for added therapeutic effect. While many cultures have herbal medicine traditions, the sophistication of Chinese herbal medicine is unsurpassed. Chinese herbal medicine has a long history reaching back several thousand years, and the resulting system is now used to treat everything from the common cold to symptoms associated with cancer. Together we can tailor a course of treatment to meet your unique health needs. There are thousands of herbs in the Chinese materia medica, of which about 300 are commonly used. You will generally receive a mixture of several different herbs in a formula that has been tailored to your condition. Chinese herbs are extremely effective and normally have only mild side effects, however it is very important to tell us about all the medications and supplements you are currently taking so that we can avoid any unwanted interactions with your formula. Being a professional herbalist requires in-depth knowledge of hundreds of plant, animal and mineral-based substances, as well as physiology, pharmacology, and Chinese medical theory. At Lawrence Acupuncture, our herbalists have years of training in both Western and Chinese herbalism, and so we use a combination of western and chinese herbs in the form of concentrated tinctures, salves, linaments, tablets and capsules, all of which are third party laboratory tested for purity and potency. The amount of information and diversity of products available to consumers in this global economy makes choosing vitamins, herbs and supplements challenging and often confusing. By consulting an expertly trained herbalist who specializes in using the highest quality, safest products available on the market, you can rest assured that the best and most specific herbal formula and/or supplements for your condition will be recommended to get the fastest results. Diet and Lifestyle Counseling We emphasize educating our patients about how to implement healthy lifestyle habits that will help them regain and then maintain health. Learning which foods can be used to restore balance, which types of exercise may be ideal, how to live in tune with the seasons, healthy cooking and food preparation, and stress management are all part of a healthy lifestyle. In addition to a healthy diet and exercise, we recommend an annual cleansing program to eliminate accumulated toxins and to reduce overload of the liver. We also carry a comprehensive line of nutritionally dense whole food supplements for people interested in a nutrition or supplement program. "}
