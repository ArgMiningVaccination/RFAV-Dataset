Therapeutic (Deep Tissue) Massage This type of massage is used to remove severe tension, to relieve both muscles and connective tissue below the surface, to help improve range of motion and heal injuries below the surface. Lymphatic Drain Massage Lymphatic Drain Massage is a specific protocol that encourages increased lymphatic flow throughout the body. It helps to remove the cell's waste and toxins, increase your immune response, increase your oxygen supply, improve nutrient delivery to your cells, and decrease chronic inflammation. This type of massage can benefit just about everyone. If you are feeling tired and low on energy, or if you have been sick and feel like your body is fighting to get back on track, we would recommend it. It is also highly recommended for individuals suffering from lymphedema and fibromyalgia, as well as athletes or following surgery. Aromatherapy Massage Aromatherapy massage is Swedish massage using essential oil infused lotion. During an aromatherapy massage, you absorb these essential oil molecules through your skin. The essential oils help aide in stress relief and manage pain. Reflexology Reflexology is a specific pressure point technique that works on precise reflex points on the feet or hands. Reflexology brings balance to the body based on the premise that those areas on the feet/hand correspond with organs and body parts. "}
