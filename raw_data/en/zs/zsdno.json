The report has been prepared in accordance with Part V1 of the Charities Act 1993 and constitutes a directors' report for the purpose of company legislation. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the a ccounting policies set out on pages 15 and 22 of the attached financial statemen ts and comply with the charitable company's memorandum and articles of associati on, applicable laws and the requirements of Statement of Recommended Practice on \"Acc ounting and Reporting by Charities\" (SORP 2005). Public benefit statement Each year our Trustees review our objectives and activities to ensure they continue to reflect our aims. In carrying out this review the Trustees have co nsidered the Charity Commission's general guidance on public benefit. The BSI (the Society) provides benefit to its members, working with students at secondary, undergraduate, masters and PhD level, and practitioners working in Immunology and allied fields ranging from researchers through to clinicians working with patients. The work of the Society's members provides benefit to several million people at home and overseas. This includes individuals being immunised or va ccinated as well as people living with immunity-related conditions, their families, friends and carers. Immunity-related conditions include all forms of cancer, diabet es, lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases , as well as conditions associated with organ transplantation. The Society plans to increase its range and outp ut of public engagement work in order to raise awareness of immunological research, infectious disease and treatment.

The BSI is also planning to work more clos ely with the media in order to reach wider audiences and provide sound, clear information to those communicating issues and stories on which immunology has a bearing. New meetings and events aimed at students and early career immunologists are scheduled as part of our education and careers programme. British Society for Immunology 2 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 Structure, Governance and Management Governing document The British Society for Immu nology (BSI) was founded in 1966 and was registered as a charity on 19 December that year. The BSI was formally incorporated on 4 January 1995 as a private company, limited by guarantee. It has no issued shar e capital and the liability of its members is limited to a sum not exceeding \u00a31. The Society's governing document is the Memorandum and Articles of Association. Trustees Members of the Board of Trustees are company directors for the purposes of the Companies Act and charity Trustees for the purposes of the Charities Act 1993 and 2006. The Trustees serving during the year and since the year end were as follows:- Trustees Appointed / Resigned Professor Arne Akbar Professor R N Barker Dr William Egner Appointed 27 April 2011 Professor David Gray Professor A Hayday Resigned 31 January 2011 Professor T Hussell Resigned 27 April 2011 Dr S R A Jolles Resigned 27 April 2011 Professor Paul Lehner Appointed 7 December 2010 Dr D Morgan Dr L Nicholson Recruitment and appointment of trustees The business of the BSI is conducted by the Board of Trustees. In any matters concerning interpretation of the rules, the decision shal l rest with the Trustees, who will also decide any matters concerning the Society which are not covered by the rules. The full rules for the appointment of Trustees, and their obligation s, are contained within the Memorandum & Articles of Association. British Society for Immunology 3 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 Structure, Governance and Management (continued) Recruitment and appointment of trustees (continued) The Trustees of the Society are elected by the membership and number no fewer than 5 and no more than 12. All Trustees have to have been a member of the Society for at least 12 months. They will include the General Secretary and Treasurer and a number of members who will take special areas of responsibility as the organisation requires. For example, these may include a Programme Secretary, Education Se cretary, International Secretary, Clinical Secretary, Group Secretary and Chair of Forum. One or more additional Trustees may be co-opted at the Trustees' discretion for up to 12 months, after which time their continuing membership of the board will be formalised by election at the AGM. As part of their induction process, Trustees spend some time at head office, with the Chief Executive and staff. They are provided with a Trustee resource pack and are taken through a number of key areas outlining the history of the Society, background information, job description, areas of responsibility and usef ul information from the Charity Commission. Trustees are briefed on key areas of governance, strategy and activity. Organisational structure As stated, the business of the Society is conducted by the Board of Trustees, which has legal responsibility for the organisation. The Board meets quarterly. The day to day management of the Society is delegated to the Chief Executive (CEO - who is also the Company Secretary) and, through her, the members of the senior management team. This comprises the CEO, Head of Marketing & Communications and the Finance Manager, supported by the Office Co-Ordinator, who is also PA to the CEO. The team works to the BSI's agreed strategic plan, the current version of which runs to the end of 2011 and has recently been reviewed. The updated plan will better reflect the current priorities of the Society and, without moving away from its core aims and objectives, will ensure that its current activities have maxi mum relevance and impact. Committees In addition to the Board of Trustees, the BSI has a representative body of approximately 16 - 20 members called the Forum. This committee is deliberative and focuses on policy. This body has no legal or management responsibility and meets biannually. The content of the Society's scientific progra mme, particularly that of congress, is the responsibility of the Programme Committee. This is a committee of up to 20 members who meet three times a year. The Clinical Immunology and Allergy Section (C IAS) of the Society has its own Executive Committee which also meets tria nnually and represents a range of clinicians, trainees and nurses. British Society for Immunology 4 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 Structure, Governance and Management (continued) Committees (continued) The BSI membership is formed into either re gional groups or affinity groups that have a specific specialist interest su ch as vaccination or mathematical modelling, to name but two. These groups run their own programmes of me etings and are supported by the Society, financially and administratively. The representatives of these groups meet formally, face to face, once a year. The BSI's journals, Immunology and Clinical and Experimental Immunology are published in partnership with Wiley-Blackwell. The Journa ls Committee meets bia nnually and comprises the BSI General Secretary and Treasurer, th e Editors-in-Chief, BSI staff members and colleagues from Wiley-Blackwell. Staff The CEO has responsibility for the Society' s income and expenditure and authorises expenditure within the agreed budget. She is al so responsible for the implementation of the strategic plan and its deliverables, for th e good governance an d management of the organisation (advising the Board as appropriate) and reporting to exte rnal bodies such as Companies House and the Charity Commission. She represents the BSI at a number of meetings and events and as a member of ex ternal committees such as the RCP Learned Societies Group, the Society of Biology, the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee and the Foundation for Science and Technology to name a few. The Finance Manager is responsible for the effective and efficien t management of the Society's finances and the reporting thereo f including working with the BSI auditors, producing management accounts and budget information, cash-flow reports and VAT returns. He has overall responsibility for finance and financial systems, IT, and aspects of membership management. The Head of Marketing & Communications ma nages the key BSI activities: journals; congress, other meetings and events; public engagement and education; membership communications and database management; publ ications and resources; website. The CEO currently works with members of the team and with some committee members in areas of policy. The Office Co-Ordinator supports the CEO in many aspects of her work including governance matters, and is the Executive Se cretary for the BSI committees. She is also responsible for HR, staff welfare and estate mana gement of the BSI's property in South West London. Most members of the small BSI team work flexibly and are involved in various activities and projects as need and resource demand. There ar e 9 full time members of staff at head office. The Editors-in-Chief and Associate Editors of the journals receive honoraria from the BSI. British Society for Immunology 5 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 Structure, Governance and Management (continued) Related parties The Society has a wholly owned subsidiary, Triangle 3 Limited, which is currently dormant and is being wound-up. Risk Management The Trustees are satisfied that there are in place adequate control systems to provide reasonable assurance against misstatement or lo ss. These include a strategic business plan reviewed by the Trustees annually, reviews of performance against targets, delegation of authority to spend within defined limits, and segregation of duties where appropriate. Other external risks to which the Society may be ex posed are identified and discussed at regular Trustees' meetings and any a ppropriate action implemented. In recognition of the economic volatility within which the BSI currently operates, the Trustees and staff of the BSI are currently em barking on a full review of risk management and reserves, in order to ensure that we continue to be financially robust and able to respond to economic and other challenges. The results of the review will be reported on in the next Trustees Report. Objectives and activities The BSI's main objective continues to be to promote and support excellence in research, scholarship and clinical practice in Immunology for the benefit of human and animal health and welfare. The BSI seeks to help British Immunology accomplish the highest possible goals. The BSI's priorities for the financial year 2010 - 2011 were: Delivering an excellent scientific programm e through congress, meetings and events The BSI runs a highly regarded congress for tw o out of every three years. The Society does not hold a congress during the year in which the European Congress of Immunology runs, which is every three years. In addition, pr ogrammes of seminars and one and two day meetings take place throughout the UK, along with summer schools and career sessions. The BSI aims to provide opportunities to discuss rese arch and good practice, to share ideas and to meet fellow immunologists. The Society prov ides meetings and even ts for immunologists throughout each stage of their careers. Producing high quality journals, Immunology and Clinical & Experimental Immunology The publication of our journals is imperative to our dissemination of research. The Society constantly strives to attract top authors and to commission innovative and useful content. The editorial teams are of a very high calibr e and are supported by eminent editorial board members from around the world. The relationshi ps between the BSI staff team, the editors, authors and publisher continues to thrive. British Society for Immunology 6 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 Objectives and activities (continued) Membership support and development The BSI provides high quality member communications through Immunology News , its quarterly members' magazine, and eNews bulle tins. It provides forums for members to engage with the Society, to be involved in committees and to run activities of particular interest to them. The BSI provides grants and bursaries to its members to attend meetings and courses. Education and public engagement activities The BSI is committed to running innovative pr ojects for non-specialist audiences including adults of all ages and young people. The Soci ety puts on events at the Cheltenham Science Festival, the British Science Associations Fe stival of Science and the Edinburgh Science Festival. The BSI actively supports the Global Day of Immunology and undertakes numerous activities in schools. The Society is involved in curriculum developmen t and the provision of careers advice along with educational resources. Web and resource development The Society has made it a priority to continue the development of its content-rich website, providing bespoke resources for specialist and non-specialist audiences. The BSI has a Facebook presence and its website constantly provides news for its growing user base. Media, PR and public affairs work The BSI works with the Science Media Centre and its members to provide input to the media. It uses the platform of its events to raise awareness of immu nology issues with the media, often at a local level. Supporting other societies The BSI supports the work of the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) and the European Federation of Immunological So cieties (EFIS). It is an active member of the Society of Biology, the Animal Science Group, Understanding Animal Research, the Royal College of Physicians, Federation of Clinical Immunological Societies (FOCIS) and the World Allergy Organisation . It also supports Transplant 2013 and Rare Disease UK. The BSI runs sessions at international meetings an d runs meetings in pa rtnership with other groups. The BSI would like to acknowledge the enormous contribution of its membership, many of whom volunteer time to attend and organise meetings, visit schools, speak on behalf of the Society and undertake many activities to ensure the success of the organisation. Alongside the 80 current committee members, there are many other members who contri bute time and ideas on a regular basis. We are grateful for their commitment and energy. British Society for Immunology 7 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 Achievements and performance Delivering an excellent scientific programm e through congress, meetings and events The 2010 Congress held in Liverpool was widely heralded a great succe ss. Delegate numbers were the highest we had seen for several year s, with over 1,000 atte ndees. The scientific programme, including special sessions for studen ts, was immensely strong and feedback from those attending was very positive. The BSI Board, Programme Committee and staff have reviewed the conference thoroughly and taken on board all comments and suggestions received in order to make further improvements to the 2011 meeting. We also held meetings with the exhibitors and sponsors to ensure we provide a successful forum for them next year and beyond. It was generally agreed that Live rpool provided an excellent conference space with close-by venues for social functions, dinne rs and informal meetings. The provision of free refreshments and a hot lunchtime meal wa s welcomed along with the evening social 'bash' and the speakers' dinner. The BSI make s a substantial loss on congress by heavily subsidising the registration fees, especially those paid by members and students. The BSI ran a session at the American Associat ion of Immunologists annual meeting in San Francisco, 13-17 May 2011. The session was Immunity at Barriers and Barriers to Immunity and was organised by Cecilia Joha nsson (Imperial College, Lond on, UK). A packed room of delegates listened to talks from Adrian Hayday (London Research Institute & King's College London), David Artis (University of Pennsy lvania School of Medicine, USA), Yasmine Belkaid (NIAID, NIH, USA), and Douglas T. Fearon (University of Cambridge, UK) as well as Cecilia herself. We would like to thank the chair and all our spea kers for taking part in what was an extremely intere sting and well-attended session. The BSI's regional and group meeting progra mme continued to flourish and grow. The Society supported more meetin g s t h a n i n p r e v i o u s y e a r s and regularly partnered and supported external meetings, such as th e PIVAC and Cambridge Immunology meetings, both of which took place in September 2010, as part of our re mit to support the dissemination and appreciation of immunology. 17 regional groups ran successful seminar series, as did the Vaccine Affinity Group an d the Mathematical Modelling Affinity Group. Longer meetings included those organized by the Scottish Immunology Group, in Ulster, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Oxford. (Some meet ings were planned an d paid for during 2010- 2011 but will feature in next year's accounts and report, as they took place just after 30 June 2011.) British Society for Immunology 8 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 Achievements and performance (continued) Producing high quality journals, Immunology and Clinical & Experimental Immunology Despite many Immunology journals seeing a drop in impact fa ctor at the end of June 2011, Immunology 's impact factor rose to 3.302 (2009: 3.276). CEI's impact factor rose to 3.134 top 5 Cited B mycobacterial and fungal pathogens; Curtis, MM; Way, SS MicroRNA in the immune system, microRNA as an immune system; Lu, LF; Liston, A The aryl hydrocarbon receptor: a perspective on potential roles in the immune system; Stevens, EA; Mezrich, JD; Bradfield, CA Other highlights included major review articles: Elizabeth Nowak & Randolph J Noelle on Interleukin-9 as a T helper type 17 cytokine Jeroen van Bergen & Frits Koning on The tortoise and the hare: slowly evolving T-cell responses take hastily evolving KIR Eric Vivier on Natural killer cells in human autoimmune diseases Timothy Thauland & David C Parker on Diversity in immunological synapse structure Andrew Croxford & Thorsten Buch on Cytokine in immunological research: perspectives and lessons learned Shigeo Koyasu on Type 2 innate immune responses and the natural helper cell Jonathan P Huber and David Farrar on Regulation of effector and memory T-cell functions by type I interferon British Society for Immunology 9 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 Achievements and performance (continued) Two of the top 5 cited articles in CEI were from the 2008 Translat ional mini review series on Complement Factor H, ed ited by Marina Botto, CEI Associate Editor. Other top-cited articles and reviews were: Analysis of islet inflammation in human type 1 diabetes; A Willcox, SJ Richardson, AJ Bone, AK Foulis & Morgan Translational Mini-Review Series on Compleme nt Factor H: Renal diseases associated with complement factor H: novel insights from humans and animals; MC Pickering & Translational Mini-Review Series on Complement Factor H: Genetics and disease associations of human complement factor H; SR de Cordoba & EG de Jorge Other highlights included major review articles: E Maggi on T-cell responses induced by allergen-specific immunotherapy N Novak and E Gros (and others) on Human skin and oral mucosal dendritic cells as \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" in allergic immune responses S Mannering, Brooks-Worrell and Tim Tree (and others) on behalf of the Immunology of Diabetes Society T-Cell Workshop Committee on Current approaches to measuring human islet- antigen specific T cell function in type 1 diabetes S Gruenheid & P Gros on Forward genetic dissection of innate response to infection in inbred mouse strains; selected success stories AN Colebatch and C J Edwards on The influence of early life factors on the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis In June 2011 CEI produced a supplement issue sponsored by Grifols, which contained 4 Review Articles under the banner of Key aspect s for an adequate immunoglobulin therapy of primary immunodeficiencies. The main author was C Cunningham-Rundles. British Society for Immunology 10 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 Achievements and performance (continued) Membership support and development BSI membership is at its highest level. We have 3,500 members and have introduced improved systems for renewing and for regist ering to attend meetings. The restyled and hugely expanded Immunology News continues to be very well received. It is evident that there is a greater sense of engagement and en thusiasm from within the membership, with a willingness to volunteer to organise sessions and special meetings, jo in working groups (such as the web / IT group who launched the BSI on Facebook) and an increase in the number of people putting themselves forward to join co mmittees and stand for election. We are very grateful for this continued and growing contribution from our members. The BSI continues to develop and grow the activity and impact of its clinical members through the work of the CIAS. The CIAS had input into Department of Health, House of Lords, Royal College of Pathologists and Royal College of Physicians activities as well as processing several applications for excellence awards. This was the third year that the BSI had been involved in nominating consultants for the Clinical Excellence Awards, administered by the Advisory Committee on Clinical Excellence Awards (ACCEA). The BSI became a member of FOCIS during the year. We provided 148 grants to individuals which tota lled nearly \u00a364k, incl uding special bursaries for the ENIS summer school in Sardinia and for the IUIS meeting in Kobe in Japan. We also provided additional bursaries for attendance at our own congress. This means that 47% of money received in member subscriptions was pa id out to members in the form of grants. Education and public engagement activities We successfully increased the extent and impa ct of our public enga gement programme. The activities we ran during congress were an en ormous success and comple mented the specialist conference content by providin g opportunities for ch ildren and non-specialist audiences to take part in activities in the city and thereb y find out more about their immune systems and some basic science. The Liverpool World Muse um was the venue for our activities at the Inside DNA exhibition. A number of activiti es entertained families throughout the 5 December who enjoyed exploring blood groups, taking part in experiments and looking down microscopes - many for the first time. We also ran a number of workshops in schools and ran a Caf\u00e9 Scientifique on 8 December where Peter Openshaw presented a talk on to what extent human studies can be carried out without safety checks on animals. The BSI took part in the Big Bang Fair, the UK's largest single celebration of science and engineering for young people. The fair ran as part of National Science and Engineering Week from the 10-12 March at ICC London ExCel Centre, attended by 25,000 people over 3 da ys. The BSI had an interactive stand on the main floor show titled \"The Secret Life of Sn ot\", which introduced people to the basis of infection and the inna te immune system. British Society for Immunology 11 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 Achievements and performance (continued) At the end of May we hosted our first event at the Science Museum's Dana Centre. This panel event facilitated discussion in the scienc e and social impact of aging and dementia and had over 100 participants. The Ch eltenham Science Festival, held in June, was the venue for our MS project 'The Big Knit'. This introduc ed the subject of neuroinflammation to the crafting community through a series of scient ist-facilitated knitting events prior to the festival. Crafters knitted neuron s, white blood cells and myelin to allow the creation of a model of inflammation in multiple sclerosis, which was the chosen focus for a high profile talk which took place at the festival. Web and resource development During the year, members of BSI staff were able to generate detailed and tailored reports of web usage, which had not been possible in previ ous years. With this information, they will be able to monitor use and growth areas effectively. The site continued to be updated, with resour ces added for general and specialist audiences. Regular blogs were available and the BSI set up a presence on Facebook. News feeds were and are available on the site, with top news st ories and regular highlights presented on the home page. Other resources were developed as part of public engagement activities (see above) and in support of work in schools. This is an on going part of the Society's work. Media, PR and public affairs work The Society continued to play a predominantly reactive role during this year. There were particularly busy times when we provided comment and spokespeople on the subject of influenza. It has been our experience that th ose working in the media generally go to known individuals for views or comment, or use servic es such as the Science Media Centre, with whom we liaise closely and provide information on speakers. It is our intention to play a proactive role from next year forward and wi ll report on the success of this next year. The BSI regularly responded to requests to provide comment from an Immunological perspective. These requests came from the Society of Biology. The Society is currently looking to how best to work with third parties to increase our public affairs and policy work. This is identified in the section on future plans. Supporting other societies The BSI provided support to other societies by paying subscriptions and promoting their work and events where appropriate (eg for the IUIS and EFIS). As reported previously, the Society put on a session at the AAI meeting and supported meetings of other organizations. British Society for Immunology 12 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 Financial review Results for the year The statement of financial activities is shown on page 18 of the annual report and accounts. The results for the year show an increase in incoming resources and expenditure, producing an overall increase in funds of \u00a3164,914, compared to an incr ease in funds of \u00a3451,409 for the previous financial year. The increase in incoming resources was due to the income generated by the society's journals, increasing to \u00a31,314,398 (2010 - \u00a31,106,521) and Congress income of \u00a3288,127 (2010 - \u00a3nil) as there was no Congress in 2010. Resources expended increased because of the expenditure relating to Congress of \u00a3494,225 (2010 - \u00a363,199). The overall net movement in funds is also st ated after a reduction in the value of the Society's investment properly of \u00a3403,000 (2010 - \u00a310,048). Investment powers, policy and performance In general terms, worldwide in vestment markets returned modest gains during the year, and the Society's financial statements report an increase in the market value of its quoted investments. Working with its current invest ment managers, the Society continues to review and develop its investment strategy to ensure it remains a ppropriate and consistent with overall strategic and financial management aims. Reserves policy The Society's reserves policy is derived from a risk assessment of each category of income and expenditure which determines the level of reserves required to cover costs and any commitments during periods of unforeseen difficu lty. The Society believes that it is prudent to maintain net current assets, plus the value of its investment po rtfolio, at a level equivalent to a minimum of twelve months average expend iture together with sufficient resources to fund future commitments relating to Congress. This target is reviewed annually as part of the overall approach to managing risk. Financial position At 30 June 2011 the Society had free reserves of \u00a32.9 million whic h is well above the targeted level. However, these reserves, whic h mainly consist of investments held for the medium to long term, give the Society certai nty in a difficult economic climate and will allow the Society to fund worthy pr ojects identified by the Trustees. British Society for Immunology 13 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 Plans for future periods The contract with our publishing partner, Wile y-Blackwell, has been renegotiated. This will give the Society increased income and a solid footing on which to continue to develop the journals. As the Society is so re liant on this income, we shall be conducting a full review of our risk management policy and our reserves policy to ensure we continue to be financially robust and able to respond to economic and other challenges. The Society plans to increase its range and outp ut of public engagement work in order to raise awareness of immunological research, infectious disease and treatment. Some activities w i l l b e a i m e d a t s e c o n d a r y s c h o o l c h i l d r e n , w i t h w h o m w e w i s h t o f o s t e r a n i n t e r e s t i n biomedical science. We are applying for fund ing for a number of new projects, including a major new arts / science collaboration. The BSI is also planning to work more clos ely with the media in order to reach wider audiences and provide sound, clear information to those communicating issues and stories on which immunology has a bearing. We have a sp ecific media campaign for congress 2011 and, if this proves successful, will build on it for fu ture meetings and events , particularly for the congresses to be held in 2013 and 2014. We are focussing on hosting the European Congress of Immunology in Glasgow during 2012. New meetings and events aimed at students and early career immunologists are scheduled as part of our education and careers programme. Ou r aim is to ensure th at, going forward, the BSI has special meetings, courses and resources aimed at each sector of the BSI membership, from early career trainees and students though to those at a senior level within their field, meeting each group's specific needs and interests. We shall be considering how we can develop our media and policy work and with whom we should ideally be working or partnering in the future to maximise our impact. The results of the work at congress 2011 will help to inform this. Statement of trustees' responsibilities The trustees (who are also directors of British Society for Immunology for the purposes of company law) are responsible for preparing the trustees' report and fi nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and Unit ed Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). Company law requires the trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the charity and of the incoming resources and application of resources, includin g the income and expenditure, of the charity for that period. In preparing these financia l statements, the trustees are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; observe the methods and principles in the Statement of Recommended Practice (Accounting and Reporting by Char ities) (the Charities' SORP); make judgements and estimates th at are reasonable and prudent; British Society for Immunology 14 Trustees' report Year to 30 June 2011 British Society for Immunology 15 Statement of trustees' responsibilities (continued) state whether applicable United Kingdom A ccounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the charity will continue in operation. The trustees are responsible for keeping adequa te accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the charity and enable them to ensure that the financial stat ements comply with the Comp anies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charity and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. Each of the trustees confirms that: so far as the trustee is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the charity's auditors are unaware; and the trustee has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a trustee in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the charity's auditors are aware of that information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006. The trustees are responsible for the maintena nce and integrity of financial information included on the charity's website. Legisl ation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Approved by the trustees and signed on their behalf by: David Gray Trustee Approved by the trustees on: 6 December 2011 Independent auditor's report 30 June 2011 Independent auditor's report to the members of the British Society for Immunology We have audited the financial statements of the British Society for Immunology for the year ended 30 June 2011 which comprise the statement of financial ac tivities, the balance sheet, the principal accounting policies and the rela ted notes. The financia l reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). This report is made solely to the charity's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our au dit work has been und ertaken so that we might state to the charity's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone othe r than the charity and the charity's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report , or for the opinions we have formed. Respective responsibilities of trustees and auditor The trustees are also the directors of the ch aritable company for the purposes of company law. As explained more fully in the Statement of trustees' responsibilities as set out in the trustees' report, the trustees are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and Internatio nal Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with th e Auditing Practices Bo ard's (APB's) Ethical Standards for Auditors. Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assura nce that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the charitable company's circumstances and have been consistently appl ied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the trustees; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the trustees' report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. British Society for Immunology 16 Independent auditor's report 30 June 2011 British Society for Immunology 17 Opinion on financial statements In our opinion the financial statements: give a true and fair view of the state of the charitable company's affairs as at 30 June 2011 and of its incoming resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure, for the year then ended; have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and have been prepared in acco rdance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion the information given in the trus tees' report for the fi nancial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. Matters on which we are required to report by exception We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: adequate accounting records have not been kept or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting reco rds and returns; or certain disclosures of trustees' remunera tion specified by law are not made; or we have not received all the information an d explanations we require for our audit. the trustees were not entitled to prepare the financial statem ents in accordance with the small companies regime.
