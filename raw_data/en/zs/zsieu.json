I started studying homeopathy two years after I started to reconnect to Judaism. When I started learning homeopathy, I never expected there to be any homeopathy in the Bible or in any spiritual tradition whatsoever. To me, medicine was medicine and religion was religion. At the time, I finished learning in [ an awesome yeshiva in Jerusalem, Israel](http://yna.edu/index.php) literally right in front of the Western Wall. I returned back to the States spiritually charged, continuing my Talmudic and college studies in Queens, NY, as well as my homeopathy studies. I first began studying homeopathy online with the [Resonance School of Homeopathy under the guidance of Robert Field](http://www.resonanceschoolofhomeopathy.com/), a terrific program. The teachings of Robert Field literally blew my mind away! I expected there to just be plain courses teaching about homeopathy and its practice. Instead, he showed us a more spiritual and vibrant side of homeopathy that was totally logical. It also fit in with a lot of healing concepts in Judaism as well. How so? We were taught that imbalances in health didn't just result from physical factors. It was directly linked to mental, emotional, and even spiritual factors led to specific ailments. [It's no coincidence that when something affects the mind or spirit of a person that there is a physical ailment that comes out](http://naturalholistichomeopathic.com/total-biology-healing-at-the-core). This was just a drop of what we learned. Some sources he quoted when discussing homeopathy even came from Kabbalah! In practice, we actually saw many of these teachings manifest live in clinic cases with clients. It was unbelievable! Further Discoveries All I could say was \"WOW!\" While discovering this unique side of homeopathy, I set out to learn more about homeopathy's spiritual side. I asked myself: how it is that homeopathy has such a strong spiritual aspect to it? I felt that the best way to figure this out was to look in my own spiritual roots. Maybe I could find it at \"home.\" I got my Bible out and began searching. I also searched online. The results I found were very interesting. I found multiple sources in the Bible (and even in Bible-based texts) that demonstrated the use of homeopathy in healing. All sources use the key homeopathic principle of like cures like, which is basically using [the energy of the illness to heal the illness itself.](http://naturalholistichomeopathic.com/succussion-in-homeopathy-how-it-works) They also only utilize small parts or potencies of the material to heal and use it only once. Video Summary Option Don't like reading? Then watch this video I made that gives you a visual of these examples in the Bible: #1 - Waters at Marah The Israelites arrived at Mara right after G-d performed the splitting of the Red Sea. They tried to drink from the water there, but they couldn't because it was bitter. Here's what happened: The people complained against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? So he cried out to the Lord, and the Lord instructed him concerning a piece of wood, which he cast into the water, and the water became sweet... (Exodus 15:24-25) We see here that G-d through Moses used homeopathic concepts to sweeten the water. How? Moses used a piece of the bitter branch and placed it in the bitter water. The water then became sweet and drinkable! Moses also used a small piece of the bitter branch, and used it only once for its energetic effect on the water. #2 - Golden Calf & #3 - Sotah Waters When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, he saw the Israelites worshipping the Golden Calf. This was one of his immediate reactions to this grave sin: Then he took the calf they (the Israelites) had made, burned it in fire, ground it to fine powder, scattered (it) upon the surface of the water, and gave (it to) the children of Israel to drink. (Exodus 32:20) Question: Why would Moses give the Israelites the powder of the Golden Calf to drink? Answer: The great medieval biblical commentator Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki) explains that Moses was performing the [Sotah procedure](http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9933#v=11). This is used when a wife is suspected of adultery by her husband. In this process, the wife drinks a meal offering mixed with water that was also mixed with the verses in Numbers that speak about the Sotah laws. If she is guilty, the waters will cause her belly to swell and she will die. If she is innocent, then the water mixed offering will be a blessing for her; she will be able to give birth to more children (we see here that the Sotah procedure is another example of homeopathy) G-d and the Israelites are compared to a husband and wife respectively. The Israelites were suspected of cheating, like a wayward wife. G-d (the husband) wanted them to undergo this process, so whoever was actually guilty would be punished, and whoever was actually innocent would be spared and blessed. Note: Not all of the Israelites were involved in the sin. Most of the sinners were of the \"mixed multitude,\" the Egyptians that converted to Judaism and joined the Israelites. The Israelites were guilty though because they did not protest the sin. #4 - Tzaraat/Leprosy [Leviticus 14](http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9915/jewish/Chapter-14.htm#showrashi=true<=primary) goes through the cleansing process that a person affected with tzaraat, a Hebrew term for unusual skin eruptions (not necessarily leprosy as some Bibles translate it). In verse 22, it says that one of the ways to heal this lesion is to give two turtledoves as an offering. Why? The biblical commentaries answer that a person can have tzaarat as a punishment for negative speech, such as gossip. Birds are appropriate because like the person using negative speech, birds tend to chatter or chirp a lot. We see here that using birds that talk a lot in a diluted/burnt form in one dose heals tzaarat, which is caused by too much negative speech. Another homeopathic example! #5 - Copper Snake Ever looked at the snake symbol on medical ambulances? It turns out that the symbol is originally from the Bible and is homeopathic (irony!): They journeyed from Mount Hor by way of the Red Sea to circle the land of Edom, and the people became disheartened because of the way. The people spoke against God and against Moses, \"Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in this desert, for there is no bread and no water, and we are disgusted with this rotten bread.\" The Lord sent against the people the venomous snakes, and they bit the people, and many people of Israel died. The people came to Moses and said, \"We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against you. Pray to the Lord that He remove the snakes from us.\" So Moses prayed on behalf of the people. The Lord said to Moses, \"Make yourself a serpent and put it on a pole, and let whoever is bitten look at it and live. Moses made a copper snake and put it on a pole, and whenever a snake bit a man, he would gaze upon the copper snake and live. (Numbers 21:5-9) The copper snake was used in a different format to energetically cure the snake bites in a minimal dose. You can't beat G-d's medicine! #6 - Red Heifer The Red Heifer is one of the most difficult passages to understand. Even King Solomon, the wisest person of all time, says in Ecclesiastes 7:23 that he could not understand the concept of the Red Heifer. The Red Heifer was used in biblical times to purify a person from certain types of impurities. But why use a cow and why does it have to be red? Jewish tradition teaches that when the Israelites sinned with the Golden Calf at Sinai, they lost an incredible opportunity to permanently fix themselves spiritually. They also lost the chance to complete the mission of Creation (which was to reveal full G-dliness into the world). As a result, spiritual impurity was brought into the world, and it had the power to spiritually contaminate a person. Measure for measure, G-d enacted this law so that whoever contracts these impurities can use the ashes of the heifer to become pure again. The Israelites sinned with a cow; the fix is now use that same type of cow for purification. As the Rabbis say: \"let the cow (Red Heifer) come and atone for the (Golden Calf) cow.\" The cow must be red, because the color red represents sins (see Isaiah 1:18). We see here that the Red Heifer (a cow) in the form of ashes atones for spiritual impurities caused by the sinful (\"red\") act of the Golden Calf (which was a cow). #7 - Elisha's Water Miracle In this episode, the prophet Elisha goes to Jericho. The people of Jericho approach him and ask him to desalinate the water. Here's the story: ...the people of the city said to Elisha, \"Behold the city is a good place to live in, as my lord sees, but the water is bad and the land causes people to die. And he said, \"Take me to a new jug and put salt therein,\" and they took to him...he went out to the source of the water and threw salt there; and he said, \"So has the Lord said, 'I have cured these waters; there will no longer be death and bereavement from there.' \"And the water became cured to this day, according to the word of Elisha that he spoke. (Kings II 2:19-22) The prophet took a solution of water, put salt in it, and poured it into the salty waters to sweeten it. It's homeopathy at it's finest!
