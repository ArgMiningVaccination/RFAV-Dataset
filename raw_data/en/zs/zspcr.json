[Teflon](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa.html)! That's right Teflon! Think non-stick cookware coating ... in your dental floss. How in the heck does this sneaky little chemical make its way into your floss? Teflon is a tough synthetic resin used to coat nonstick cooking pans, pizza boxes, and waterproof clothing. This toxic chemical is used to help glide floss easily between your teeth. The [American Dental Association](https://www.ada.org/en) recommends daily between-teeth cleaning, by using floss or other interdental cleaners that may help prevent cavities and gum disease. A [new study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-018-0109-y#Sec13) suggests certain types of floss and other behaviors may actually increase the amount of toxic chemicals in the body. For the study, scientists examined the blood samples of 178 California-based middle-aged women, half of whom were white or African American, and measured 11 different [poly-fluoroalkyl substances (or PFAS)](https://www.epa.gov/pfas/basic-information-pfas). According to the study, women who flossed with a particular dental floss had higher levels of PFAS compared to women who did not. Teflon belongs to this group of chemicals, PFAS - Polyfluoroalkyl Substances.
