Many people are in the habit to reach out to their bottle of body lotion when they run out of their face cream or in general just keep one product on their shelf and use it all over thinking that all skin care products have the same application and make. But this is not the case. Body lotions are thicker and oilier. They are formulated for your body which also tends to sweat more and so it is more fragrant. Using body lotion as face cream can lead to breakouts or allergic reactions and can make the skin look oily. Always use a face cream that is more gently and less fragrant.

While soap is perfectly fine for use on the rest of your body, stick to gentle cleansers for your face only!

Baking soda is alkaline and the use of it on the face is not at all recommended by skincare experts.
