These guidelines are based on data and lessons learned through Adverse Events Following Immunizations (AEFI) case management and causality assessments within the Vaccine Healthcare Centers Network ( www.VHCinfo.org ; www.who. int/vaccines-documents/DocsPDF05/815.pdf ). However, the ITK is a reference and should always be used with manufacturers' package inserts (approved by the Food and Drug Administration), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Information Sheets (VIS), proper screening for individual patient health risk factors and medical problems, and healthcare providers' orders. Screening for individual vaccine benets and risks is the responsibility of a credentialed healthcare provider. If standing orders are used, the screening process (e.g., standardized health risk assessment questionnaire) is responsible for ensuring identication of individuals who require expanded evaluation and potentially direct, face-to-face provider evaluation before immunization. In some cases, a person will need referral to a consultant or healthcare provider . This provider will evaluate the risks and benets related to the immunization and medical exemption status. In some cases, such as severe large local reactions, modied strategies for how to administer the vaccine may be indicated and require a written order from the healthcare provider (e.g., giving anthrax vaccine by the intramuscular route reduces the severity of local reactions and their complications). The Vaccine Healthcare Centers (VHC) Network clinical staff is available for expert consultations for both healthcare workers and service members/ beneciaries when there are questions about vaccine effectiveness, safety, and acceptability. In addition, the VHC supports a Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) registry for long-term clinical case management and medical exemption tracking.

The VHC Network supports Department of Defense (DoD) immunization programs through expert clinical, investigational, educational and consultative services for individual service members, beneciaries, and healthcare workers, as well as other government-associated stakeholders. The VHC Network was initially developed as a congressionally-sponsored program in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2001. The VHC Network became a division of the Military Vaccine Ofce (MILVAX) on 1 October 2007. Additional information about this program is available online through a congressionally sponsored Government Accountability Ofce (GAO) review published at www.gao.gov (GAO-07-787R, \"Military Health: DoD's Vaccine Healthcare Centers 29, 2007; GAO Code 290549). The VHC Network provides global outreach supporting specialized expertise in immunization healthcare (with a focus on adult, travel, and biodefense vaccines) that is dedicated to enhanced vaccine effectiveness, safety and acceptability. The Network supports adverse events evaluations and reporting through the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS- http://vaers.hhs.gov/ ). It also provides enhanced individual case management and causality assessments for medical exemptions and adverse events. In addition, the staff of the VHC Network is dedicated to the development of new adverse events case denitions, clinical guidelines for diagnostics, treatments and follow-up care, immunization healthcare research, and continuous quality improvement through improved competency training and consultation resources.

The ITK provides a practical reference that facilitates and enhances the delivery of quality immunization healthcare to Department of Defense (DoD) beneciaries and employees. As both active and passive vaccines increase in number and complexity, competency training and sustainment with adherence to best practices presents a signicant challenge. Standards for quality care are detailed in the most recent joint regulations for \"Medical Services Immunizations and Chemoprophylaxis\" (published September 29, 2006 at www.vaccines.mil/documents/969r40_562.pdf ) and in national guidelines published by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee in March 2000 (\"Adult Immunization Programs in Nontraditional Settings: Quality Standards and Guidance for Program Evaluation\" at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/ preview/mmwrhtml/rr4901a1.htm ). The Military Health System (MHS) is dedicated to providing excellence in healthcare services and the content of this tool kit represents one of several educational resources developed by the Vaccine Healthcare Centers Network in collaboration with MILVAX and the new Immunization University Program ( www.vaccines.mil ) to enhance vaccine efcacy, safety and acceptability. The role of the VHC is to serve healthcare workers who serve DOD personnel as well as service members, their families or advocates, and other beneciaries with special issues related to vaccines, medical exemptions, adverse events evaluation, reporting and care management, For more information regarding VHC Network services and a downloadable format of the Tool Kit, please visit our web site: www.VHCinfo.org . A program for obtaining continuing education credit based on studying the information in the ITK is under development and will be made available through www.VHCinfo.org in late 2007. We want to highlight for our users the excellent one-stop Quick Reference Chart that provides easy access to policy, CDC guidelines documents and service-specic messages by vaccine at www.vaccines.mil/default.aspx?cnt=resource/quickReferenceChartHome . If you have specic clinical concerns or are interested in participating in our medical exemption/adverse events registry, call our 24/7 Clinical Call Center at 1-866-210-6469 or send your questions or requests for help to the secure web-based consultation service at https://askvhc.wramc.army . mil. For information about vaccine research protocols, call 202-782-041 1. We appreciate your feedback and suggestions for quality improvements in this resource. Please take a moment and complete our ITK survey online at www.VHCinfo. org. Sustainment of this resource is based on information that validates the utility to you and those you serve. We look forward to serving you! Renata J. M. Engler, MD COL, MCixForeward From the Director The Vaccine Healthcare Centers Network (VHC) compiled the material in this Immunization Tool Kit (ITK) in conformity with its mission to support continuous quality improvement of immunization healthcare delivery throughout the DoD. The ITK is intended to be a pocket-sized, readily available source of essential information on vaccines and immunization recommendations for all levels of healthcare workers. It is not a comprehensive reference for initial competency training. Vaccines are prescription drugs. The guidelines and directions for safe administration of this special group of drugs are detailed in the manufacturers' package inserts (approved by the Food and Drug Administration or FDA) with supplemental information from national consensus guidelines detailed in the Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWR). MMWR can be found online at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/ (requests for complete set: 800- 232-2522). It is important to remember for quality care of individual service members and beneciaries that this information applies to populations. It does not eliminate the need to evaluate individual medical history and clinical status (ill or well). Also \"safe and effective\" does not mean that there are NO adverse events or rare serious reactions. Myopericarditis after smallpox vaccine is one example of a new adverse event that has been dened as probably causally linked to the vaccine. In response, the VHC Network creates clinical guidelines for diagnosis, care, and follow up to assure that the newest information is provided to healthcare workers and vaccinees. In addition, direct consultation with the VHC Network and enrollment in the adverse events registry of affected patients ensures access to information that may not be found in the standard resources. The VHC gratefully acknowledges the invaluable feedback and focus group critiques provided by reviewers from all the services and the staff and students of the Walter Reed Immunization-Allergy Specialty Course.

Immunizations are safe for the majority of the population because of advances in medical research and ongoing review by doctors, researchers, and public health ofcials. Immunizations are recommended for infants, young children, adolescents, adults, the elderly, and those with chronic health problems (who are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases). While rare risks can accompany any immunization (like any other drug), people are far more likely to be seriously harmed by vaccine-preventable diseases than by the recommended immunizations that prevent them. Medical advances have resulted in the availability of an increasing number of progressively more effective and safer vaccines. Now, people can be protected against a greater number of serious diseases than ever before. Immunization benets not just the individual, but also the community. Communicable infectious diseases spread among people who have not been immunized and among the small percentage of people for whom an immunization may not have been fully effective. When you get immunized, you help others as well as yourself! Immunizations work by strengthening the body's own immune defenses in specic ways. While breastfeeding and taking vitamins have general health bene ts, they do not replace the specic benets of vaccines in preventing infectious diseases. Without immunizations, the diseases from which we are now protected could easily return to infect, disable, and even kill, many people of all ages.

Listen, evaluate, and dene concerns 2. Recognize and validate concerns (acknowledge patient's perspective) 3. Provide context for immunization recommendation (what are the disease risks) 4. Identify and address misinformation (avoiding confrontational or adversarial approach and/or attitude) 5. Provide balanced information: what we know, what we do not know 6. Recognize the importance of the patient's/advocate's/parent's partnership in clinical decision 7. Educate about potential consequences in the context of risk- benet issues 8. Make a clear recommendation that addresses concerns and allows for a second opinion if needed Adapted with revisions from Halperin, S., MD. Addressing doubts about immunization.Canadian Immunization Awareness Program. Canadian Public Health Association: www.immunize.cpha.ca If a patient requests a second opinion , provide him or her with a local specialty consultation referral or contact the Vaccine Healthcare Centers Network: at a Regional Vaccine Healthcare Center (see www.vhcinfo.org ) at the Clinical Call Center (24/7 support) 1-866-210-6469 by phone for a referral to a VHC clinical consultant: 1-202-782-041 1 by web to a VHC clinical consultant: https://askvhc.wramc.amedd.army.mil 1-2 Standards for Military Immunization Standard 1: Immunization Availability a. Immunizations are available with minimum disruption of deployment or training schedules. b. Immunizations are available at convenient times, without unnecessary barriers. Immunization services are available on a walk-in basis, as staf ng permits. Physical examinations and temperature measurements before immunization are not routinely required if they would delay or impede the timely receipt of immunizations. As clinically appropriate, beneciaries receive simultaneously the vaccine doses required. c. Immunization services are responsive to the needs of beneciaries. d. Providers incorporate immunization screening and services as a routine part of clinical care for all beneciaries. Standing orders with quality-assurance procedures are implemented, rather than depending on individual written orders or referral from a primary care provider. Standard 2: Information and Education Before Immunization a. Current versions of DOD information brochures or CDC VISs are provided before immunization and conspicuously available in waiting areas of immunization clinics. b. Immunization personnel know how to readily obtain answers to patients' immunization questions. Personnel are available to accurately address questions and concerns posed by the vaccinee. c. Before immunization, the vaccinee (individually or collectively) is given information about benets and risks associated with immunization. For complicated topics (for example, anthrax, smallpox), detailed educational programs and brochures are provided. This information is culturally appropriate and at an appropriate level. Standard 3: Vaccine Storage and Handling a. Staff members adhere to cold-chain management principles, including both transportation and storage. A temperature monitoring process is used. b. Vaccine inventories exceeding $25,000 are connected to temperature recording devices and alarm systems. Standard 4: Indications and Contraindications to Immunization a. Each patient is asked about allergies, health status, and previous adverse events before immunization. Each patient is provided an opportunity to ask questions about potential contraindications. Patients are referred for appropriate medical evaluation as needed. b. During screening, the patient receives a comprehensive screening for all vaccine needs. c. Immunization personnel understand the patient's personal situation before immunization. If a contraindication to immunization exists, this information is documented in the health record and immunization tracking system. Women are screened with regard to pregnancy. Standard 5: Immunization Record Keeping a. Immunizations are recorded accurately in a DOD-approved electronic tracking system according to Service-specic policy. Immunization records are updated at the time of immunization. b. The immunization clinic or military unit has one or more mechanisms for notifying patients when the next dose of an immunization series is needed (that is, a reminder system). c. The immunization clinic or military unit has one or more mechanisms for notifying patients when they are overdue for immunization (that is, a recall system). d. Electronic ITSs are the preferred immunization record for DOD and USCG personnel. All Services record military immunization data into an electronic database that communicates with a centralized DOD registry. Reminder and recall systems may be automated or manual and may include mailed, e-mailed, or telephone messages. 1-3Standard 6: Training a. Persons who administer vaccines must be appropriately trained. b. Medical personnel administer vaccines after training to a standard acceptable to the MTF commander, command surgeon, or other appropriate medical authority. Training will include vaccine storage and handling, vaccine characteristics, patient interviewing techniques, distinguishing valid and invalid contraindications, injection technique, documentation, managing and reporting of adverse events, and anaphylaxis. c. Persons who administer vaccines complete at least 8 hours of annual continuing education and training on current immunization recommendations, schedules, and techniques. Training resources include resident courses, the self-paced Project Immune Readiness (www.vhcinfo.org), and video training from CDC. d. Persons who administer vaccines have ready access to information resources regarding current recommendations for childhood, general adult, travel, and military-speci c immunizations. Standard 7: Adverse Events After Immunization a. Epinephrine (such as auto-injectable epinephrine), properly stored, is readily available, along with other supplies determined locally. b. Staff members have ready access to reporting options for the VAERS. c. A quality improvement process assures adverse events are reported to VAERS promptly. d. Persons who administer vaccines are close to a telephone or radio, so emergency medical personnel can be summoned. Medical providers document adverse events in the health record at the time of the event or as soon as possible thereafter . Standard 8: Vaccine Advocacy to Protect the Military Family a. The medical facility knows the extent of influenza and pneumococcal immunization coverage among its high-risk patients and has a plan to optimize that level. b. The medical facility implements a plan to optimize immunization rates among cardiac, pulmonary, diabetic, asplenic, and other patient groups at elevated risk of complications from vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. c. The medical facility conducts a quality improvement program to optimize its performance in immunizing children, adolescents, and adults against the preventable infections that most threaten them. d. Commanders use immunization databases to identify and resolve the vulnerabilities of their units. e. Commanders have plans to help their beneciaries optimize their personal protection against preventable infectious diseases and meet national goals for optimal delivery of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. All healthcare providers (not just those in immunization clinics) routinely determine the immunization status of their patients, of fer vaccines to those for whom they are indicated, and maintain complete immunization records.

Civilian access to this education is available at www.vhcpir.org . 1-4Missed Opportunities for Immunizations Opportunities missed by providers to immunize can signicantly contribute to undervaccination. Missed opportunities usually arise when the provider: Presumes that his or her immunization practices do not need improvement. Does not attempt to obtain immunization information from prior providers. Has no access to client immunization records; for example, the parent or client forgets to bring the immunization card to the visit. The clinic or physician's ofce does not maintain adequate, accessible, and up-to-date immunization records on all patients, or the patient presents at the emergency department where his or her immunization record is not on le. Does not review or incorrectly assesses client immunization status; for example, the provider does not check the patient's records or think to ask the patient (or his or her parent) whether he or she is up to date on his or her immunizations, or the provider does not obtain immunization history from the patient's prior providers. This kind of missed opportunity has special implications for the elderly who are often discharged from hospitals without any assessment of their immunization status or risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. Hospital care is a marker for identifying many patients who are destined to be re-admitted with pneumococcal infections and influenza- associated respiratory conditions. Does not understand indications; for example, the provider does not administer all recommended vaccines during a single visit. Has no actively implemented system in place for reminding clients of upcoming immunization needs and recalling clients who have missed immunization visits. Misinterprets contraindications; for example, the provider does not immunize a child with a mild illness, even though that illness does not constitute a true contraindication to immunization. Refers clients to public health clinics and other sources of free or low-cost immunizations. For some people, especially those outside of metropolitan areas, such referrals pose problems of availability and access to immunizations. 1-5Missed Visits Missed visits also account for a large percentage of children, adolescents, and adults who fail to receive age-appropriate vaccinations. A missed visit is a function of both provider-related (e.g., failure to schedule visits) and consumer- related (e.g., failure to keep appointments) factors. Some contributing factors to missed visits include lack of flexibility in scheduling and limited services (e.g., few providers, limited hours of operation). For example, a family that calls to schedule an appointment and nds that they must wait several weeks may be likely to forget the appointment when it comes around or refuse to schedule because it is so far in the future.

Adequate training of personnel and regular review of storage and handling procedures using a standardized checklist is essential. Both CDC and JCAHO emphasize proper handling and storage to ensure vaccine effectiveness and safety.

(Adapted from MMWR 2006 / 55(RR15);1-48) Unvaccinated people may not be fully protected against measles during the entire suggested time interval, and additional doses of immune globulin and/or measles vaccine might be indicated after measles exposure. The concentration of measles antibody in a particular immune globulin preparation can vary by its manufacturer's lot. Rates of antibody clearance after receipt of an immune globulin preparation also might vary. Recommended intervals are taken from an estimated half-life of 30 days for passively acquired antibody and an observed interference with the immune response to measles vaccine for 5 months after a dose of 80 mg IgG/kg. * Assumes a serum IgG concentration of 16 mg/mL. ** Measles and varicella vaccination are recommended for most HIV -infected children (mild and/or asymptomatic) who do not have evidence of severe immune suppression, but it is contraindicated for patients who have congenital disorders of the immune system. ^ This investigational product VariZIG, similar to licensed VZIG, is puried human immune globulin preparation made from plasma containing high levels of anti-varicella antibodies. When indicated, healthcare providers should make every effort to obtain and administer VariZIG.

Generalized urticaria Chest tightness or cough Angioedema Laryngeal edema of impending doom Disorientation Shock ANAPHYLAXIS: DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Anaphylaxis : a generalized allergic reaction affecting one or more organ systems (e.g., skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular), but not including a local reaction. Syndromes that may present similar signs or symptoms include: Vasovagal react ion - usually secondary to anxiety or painful situations (but is NOT under voluntary control) and frequently in physically t individuals with a history of fainting easily. The patient appears pale and may complain of nausea before syncope (fainting), but does not become pruritic (itchy), flushed (redness in face, neck), or cyanotic (blue discoloration). There may be a signicant fall in blood pressure and/or slowed heart rate. Patients usually experience profuse diaphoresis (sweating). These patients usually improve spontaneously without medication. Rarely , a low heart rate causes blood pressure to fall, which may result in fainting. If fainting does occur , monitor the patient until symptoms resolve. If a patient is at risk for this type of reaction, administer shot in such a way as to reduce the risk of injury related to a fall (e.g., place patient in a reclining position with feet elevated). Hyperventilation - may also cause breathlessness and collapse. Peripheral tingling sensations are experienced without any other associated signs or symptoms. Blood pressure and pulse are maintained, unless associated with a vasovagal reaction. Hypoglycemic reaction - usually secondary to a fall in blood sugar and may be related to not having had breakfast and prolonged standing or activity prior to the immunization. Symptoms may be mild or severe and may range from mild weakness or dizziness to symptoms that can be mistaken for a vasovagal reaction or a stroke (nervousness, sweating, intense hunger, trembling, weakness, palpitations, trouble speaking). Asking patients if they have eaten (particularly if they have diabetes or it is later in the morning) and if they have problems with this type of reaction may allow for prevention of a reaction after immunization by encouraging a snack or sugar containing drink. In large immunization programs, it may be advisable to have some emergency snacks or drinks available. ANAPHYLAXIS: Signs and Symptoms in the context of administering medications, immunizations, or allergen immunotherapy 1-17ANAPHYLAXIS VASOVAGAL REACTION Respiratory Shortness of breath Hyperventilation (rapid breathing) Hoarse, lump in throat, difculty swallowing Wheezing, chest tightness Oxygen saturation: normal or Oxygen saturation: normal or Nasal congestion, rhinorrhea Cardiovascular Tachycardia Normal Systolic r (hives), angioedemaCool, clammy diaphoresis CNS Feeling of Abdominal cramps/ diarrheaDifferential Diagnosis* 1-18*It is not always easy to discriminate between vasovagal and anaphylaxis reactions. Flushing (limited to the head and neck) and panic disorders, in the absence of other signs and symptoms, also may be confused with anaphylaxis.Principles of Anaphylaxis Management CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF ANAPHYLAXIS: Anaphylaxis may develop gradually over minutes or hours after exposure to a trigger. The rst signs may be a sensation of warmth or flushing, followed by development of generalized pruritus (itching), urticaria (hives), and angioedema (deep tissue swelling often of the face) or nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhea (runny nose) with conjunctival injection (red, prominent blood vessels in the whites of the eyes frequently associated with watery discharge). Voice change and/or respiratory stridor may indicate pharyngeal edema. Wheezing, a sign of bronchospasm, may progress to severe respiratory distress. All this may be complicated by the development of shock or vascular collapse. The reaction may have an accelerated time course often described as \"severe rapidly progressive anaphylaxis.\" Respiratory and/or cardiovascular arrest may occur within minutes. The reaction may improve and then recur with even greater severity many hours after the initial symptoms. Anaphylaxis may present in many ways and with varying levels of severity . With severe rapidly progressive anaphylaxis, speed of epinephrine administration is critical for survival. Anaphylaxis may occur with a delayed onset of several hours (or even days) after Japanese encephalitis vaccination. A b-tryptase blood level between 1 and 5 hours after the reaction may conrm the diagnosis. Subjective symptoms of anaphylaxis only (may or may not be true anaphylaxis): Consider symptoms to be anaphylaxis until proven otherwise in a high-risk situation (e.g., allergen immunotherapy or parenteral medication administration, such as a vaccine). Cutaneous anaphylaxis (itching, hives, angioedema and/or flushing only with no respiratory or cardiovascular compromise): Treat with epinephrine, although recovery may occur spontaneously or with symptomatic treatment (antihistamine alone). Do not delay treatment with epinephrine because more severe anaphylaxis may occur . Systemic anaphylaxis (symptoms and/or signs of respiratory and/or cardiovascular involvement): Immediately administer IM epinephrine, preferably into the vastus lateralis muscle (anterolateral thigh) for optimal blood level. Use deltoid muscle as alternative site if thigh is inaccessible. Severe rapidly progressive anaphylaxis : Administer IM epinephrine immediately into the vastus lateralis muscle, even through clothing. Simultaneously with epinephrine injection, start IV line and begin oxygen therapy . Repeat epinephrine dose every 1 to 5 minutes, as needed. Administer topical epinephrine to the posterior pharynx (back of throat) if laryngeal edema is present. Beta-blocker therapy is associated with a poor response to epinephrine in the setting of anaphylaxis. Glucagon therapy may be life-saving in this setting and should be considered. 1-191-20Immediate intervention following diagnosis of anaphylaxis Rapidly assess airway, breathing, circulation, and mental status Avoid patient movement, if possible. Walking may increase rate of anaphylaxis progression. Place patient in a supine position and elevate legs, if clinical condition allows. With symptoms of asthma or laryngeal edema, place patient in position that facilitates breathing (not supine). For adults : Administer epinephrine : use 1:1000 (aqueous, 1 mg/mL) 0.3 to 0.5 mL IM into anterolateral thigh or deltoid OR, if available, use autoinject - able epinephrine (EpiPen\u00ae Adult 0.3 mg)* For children : Administer epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg body weight IM to a maximum of 0.3 mg OR, if available, use autoinjectable epinephrine (EpiPen Junior\u00ae 0.15 mg)* Repeat every 10 to 15 minutes unless symptoms progress or compromise breathing or blood pressure. If symptoms progress or breathing or blood pressure are compromised, repeat every 1 to 5 minutes while establishing an intravenous line and preparing for aggressive resuscitation. *EpiPens\u00ae are convenient and suited to rapid injection while other preparations for treat - ment are underway. Caution: Hold EpiPen\u00ae in place for 10 seconds after injection to avoid injecting the epinephrine into the air. There is a time delay in ring. If the patient is in anaphylactic shock : Intravenous epinephrine can be used using 1:10,000 dilution for optimum safety. Infuse at 1 mcg/min initially, then 2 to 10 mcg/min, unless higher doses are indicated in an ACLS* setting. May use 1:100,000 dilution for titration of dose to clinical response by diluting 0.1 mL of 1:1,000 in 10 mL of normal saline (=1:100,000 dilution) Repeat as necessary in anaphylaxis not responding to epinephrine injections and volume resuscitation. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring is essential. If unresponsive to treatment, consider complicating factors, such as beta- blocker therapy, and the need for glucagon. For severe rapidly progressive anaphylaxis with no IV access , consider administration of epinephrine via the pharyngeal mucosa, by nebulization, or by the intraosseous route. * ACLS (advanced cardiac life support). For advanced cardiac management see: http://www.fpnotebook.com/CVCh1.htmPrinciples of Anaphylaxis Management (Continued)1-21Principles of Anaphylaxis Management (Continued) Assess patient status continuously and assure that adequate support personnel, including resuscitation team, are available if patient has any cardiac or respiratory compromise. Important Components of Anaphylaxis Care Oxygen : 6 to 8 L/min (to keep saturation greater than 90%). If patient has chronic obstructive lung disease, 2 to 4 L/min to avoid respiratory arrest. Fluids : Administer normal saline intravenously for fluid replacement and venous access. If patient is severely hypotensive, rapidly infuse volume expanders (colloid-containing solutions). Bronchodilator therapy for asthma: Nebulized albuterol 0.5 mL of 0.5% solution in 2.5 mL of saline, or levalbuterol (Xopenex) 0.63 to 1.25 mg unit dose, and repeat as necessary. Systemic corticosteroids , such as methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg per 24 hours, are usually not helpful acutely but might prevent prolonged reactions or relapses. Use to prevent delayed or biphasic anaphylaxis in patients with cardiopulmonary compromise. H1 blocker: Administer diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg or more in divided doses orally or intravenously, with maximum daily dose of 400 mg for adults and 300 mg (5 mg/kg) for children. Non-sedating antihistamines may be preferred. H2 blockers : Dilute ranitidine 50 mg for adults and 12.5 to 50 mg (1 mg/kg) for children in 5% dextrose to a total volume of 20 mL and inject intravenously over 5 minutes. Alternately, administer cimetidine 4 mg/kg to adults , but no pediatric dosage in anaphylaxis has been established . Refractory hypotension and beta-blocker : Administer glucagon 1 to 5 mg (20 to 30 mcg/kg [maximum 1 mg] for children) intravenously over 5 minutes, followed by an infusion of 5 to 15 mcg/min. Observe aspiration precautions because glucagon may cause nausea and emesis.1-22Principles of Anaphylaxis Management (Continued) Additional Therapeutic Interventions Reduce allergen absorption: A venous tourniquet above the reaction site might decrease absorption of an injected allergen or venom (evidence to sup - port this is limited). Use extreme caution to avoid injury caused by reduced blood flow from the tourniquet or sudden rapid antigen release when the tourniquet is removed. Administration of local epinephrine to delay absorption is a controversial recommendation. Hypotension refractory to volume replacement, epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and glucagon injections: Administer dopamine 400 mg in 500 mL of 5% dextrose in water intravenously at 2 to 20 mcg/kg/minute, titrated to maintain adequate blood pressure. Monitor hemodynamic status. High-dose epinephrine IV in adults : 1 to 3 mg (1:10,000 dilution) slowly over 3 minutes, 3 to 5 mg over 3 minutes, and then 4 to 10 mcg/min infusion. High-dose epinephrine IV in children : 0.01 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg of a 1:10,000 solution) repeated every 3 to 5 minutes for ongoing arrest. Consider higher subsequent doses (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg, 0.1 mL/kg of a 1:1,000 solution) for unresponsive asystole or pulseless electrical activity . Advanced cardiac life support interventions and guidelines apply if car - diovascular compromise worsens or results in cardiopulmonary arrest. Maintain prolonged resuscitation efforts. Efforts are more likely to be successful in anaphylaxis, because the subject is often a young person with a healthy cardiovascular system. Administer atropine and begin transcutaneous pacing if asystole or pulseless electrical activity is present. Vasovagal reaction with hypotension: Nonallergic reaction characterized by slow pulse, nausea, pallor, sweating, clammy skin, and hypotension. Place patient in a supine position with elevation of the lower extremities and monitor vital signs. Atropine for bradycardia with hypotension: 0.3 to 0.5 mg (0.02 mg/kg) SC every 10 minutes ( maximum 2 mg for adults and 1 mg for children ) or per ACLS guidelines.

Detailed Standard Operating Procedure with training guidelines available from AskAllergy@na.amedd.army.milAdverse Events After Vaccination (Information for Patients) Do vaccines have side effects? Vaccines are prescription drugs. Like all drugs, vaccines can cause side effects. Some side effects after vaccination are common but usually not serious. These side effects are often expected to occur and although usually mild, some people and may interfere with work or play for a few days. Other side ef fects are less common or unexpected and may have more serious or long-lasting ef fects. More serious or long-lasting side effects, also known as vaccine adverse events or adverse events after immunization (AEFI), occur less commonly but should be evaluated and documented for medical exemption assessment. Is there anything that I can do to prevent side effects after vaccination? While most vaccine side effects are minor, you can help to prevent some of the more serious side effects if you: LEARN about the vaccine. ASK o if there are any reasons why you should not receive the vaccine. o what possible side effects need medical care and when to call the healthcare provider if they occur. You can request more information from the Vaccine Healthcare Centers (VHC) Network by calling the Vaccine Clinical Call Center at 1-866-210-6469 (available 24 hours/day, 7 days/week), or online: https:// askvhc.wramc.amedd.army .mil How can I learn about the vaccines that I am going to get? Ask your healthcare provider for vaccine-specific fact sheets. These fact sheets explain the disease and describe common and rare side effects, as well as the benefits of the vaccine. The fact sheets also describe reasons (contraindications) why certain people should not get a vaccine. Fact sheets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are called Vaccine Information Statements (VIS). You can find copies in English at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/default.htm or in a variety of lan - guages at www.immunize.org/vis/index.htm ). The Department of Defense (DoD) has similar brochures for vaccines such as anthrax and smallpox. Clinics may provide additional information. Read the information carefully and save it in your personal records. If you think you should not get a vaccine, or that it might lead to a serious side effect, discuss this with your healthcare provider or contact the VHC Network before you are vaccinated. What are expected side effects after vaccination? The most common side effects are local (occur where the vaccine is injected). Local side effects include itching, burning, redness, minor swelling, and/or discomfort. Other common side effects may include headache, body aches, chills, fatigue, and muscle and/or joint aches. These short-term expected side effects do not pose a risk to your health and do not require reporting to the V accine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) discussed on page 1-25. You can reduce aches, pains, and fever with Tylenol\u00ae, ibuprofen, or aspirin-like medications, unless you should avoid these drugs.1-23Adverse Events After Vaccination (Continued) What should I do if I have unexpected or more serious side effects, or if my side effects do not go away? Report any chest pain, numbness (tingling or burning), ulcers (sores), blisters, or skin rashes to your healthcare provider RIGHT AWAY . If these symptoms, or any other side effects such as muscle and/or joint aches, last for more than a few days or become severe, contact your healthcare provider RIGHT AWAY . When you see your healthcare provider: * LIST what vaccines you received. * DESCRIBE (or LIST) your symptoms and when they started or got worse * SEPARATE new symptoms from old health problems that may have gotten worse. The vaccination may not be the cause of your symptoms. For example, a health problem unrelated to the vaccine, such as diabetes, lung disease, or infection might be causing symptoms that need medical treatment. On the other hand, if your symptoms are due to a vaccine, do not assume that serious or persistent side effects will go away if you just wait. You know your body - if you think that something is wrong, ask your healthcare provider to evaluate you. Medical treatment can make you more comfortable and may prevent more serious illness. What if I ask my healthcare provider about a side effect and am still concerned, or if I want to talk with a vaccine expert? If you continue to have concerns or need additional help after an evaluation has been completed, you may: \u00b7 REQUEST referral to a specialist for the medical problem (such as an allergist for an allergic reaction or a dermatologist for a persistent rash). \u00b7 CONTACT yourself or ASK your healthcare provider to contact the Vaccine Healthcare Centers (VHC) Network for vaccine safety expert consultation the DoD Clinical Center directly toll-free at 1-866-210-6469 or online: https:// askvhc.wramc.amedd.army .mil What is the Vaccine Healthcare Centers (VHC) Network? The Department of Defense Healthcare System is committed to quality vac - cination services and care. It established the VHC Network in 2001 to promote vaccination safety and to provide expert consultation for patients and providers, especially for side effects that are unexpected, prolonged, or serious. VHC experts care about your concerns and want to make sure that you get the proper treatment. The VHC Network provides clinical support services, education, re - search, and quality improvement programs that enhance vaccine safety , efficacy, and acceptability. 1-24Adverse Events After Vaccination (Continued) How can I make sure that my side effect is reported to people who monitor vaccine safety? Severe side effects are also called adverse events. The CDC and Food and Drug Administration jointly manage the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting Sys - tem (VAERS). The main purpose of VAERS is to identify important new safety concerns and to ensure that the benefits of vaccines continue to be far greater than the risks. The VHC staff helps patients and healthcare workers to complete detailed VAERS reports. A detailed and accurate report of serious side effects after vaccination is important in monitoring vaccine safety. Even so, it may be impossible to prove or disprove that a vaccination caused any individual problem. Rare side ef fects may not have been recognized before a vaccine was licensed, because these side effects may occur only a few times for every million persons vaccinated. For more information about VAERS, go to: vaers.hhs.gov or call 1-800-822-7967. Your detailed reporting of adverse events helps to make the program better. What if I am worried about getting the next dose in a vaccination series? If you are due to receive another dose of a vaccine to which you had a previous reaction, tell your healthcare provider as soon as possible. Keep a written copy of your past medical evaluations and bring it to your healthcare provider's office. If, for some reason, you cannot be evaluated before the next vaccination is due, any healthcare provider can grant a temporary exemption for up to one year or until the final determination has been made about your case. If you disagree with the exemption decision, you have the right to request a referral to a medical specialist. What are vaccine exemptions? There are two kinds of vaccine exemptions (reasons for not receiving a vaccine or delaying the next dose): administrative and medical. Descriptions of these exemptions are available at: www.vaccines.mi l and www.vhcinfo.org . Reasons for exemptions include a: \u00b7 CONDITION (such as pregnancy or an acute illness) that might interfere with how the vaccine works. \u00b7 CONTRAINDICATION, which is a medical condition that increases the risk of a serious adverse event after a vaccination. What happens if I receive a vaccine and then find out that I had a contraindication to that vaccine? Tell your healthcare provider about the contraindication as soon as possible to see whether you need treatment. In most cases like this, the vaccinated person does well and has no serious problems. The contraindication should be 1-25Caring for Adverse Events After Vaccination (Continued) evaluated and documented. A medical exemption should be recorded in your official record after the evaluation is completed. Before each vaccination you receive, during medical screening for contraindications, make sure you provide information about your other medical conditions, and any past history of adverse events with vaccines, drugs, or foods. For clinical consultation support for you, your family, or your healthcare provider CALL 1-866-210-6469 or online: https:// askvhc.wramc.amedd.army .mil. For more information about vaccine safety and adverse event guidelines: Go to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program? The VICP is a Federal \"no-fault\" system that compensates individuals or families of individuals who have been injured by vaccines covered under this program. Compensation is available for both children and adults who receive certain covered vaccines, whether the vaccine is administered in the private or public sector. What vaccines are covered under VICP? Currently, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP, DTaP, Tdap), or any IPV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type (Hib), (chicken vaccines are covered. Eight years' retroactive coverage is provided for any vaccine or vac - cine-related adverse event added for coverage under the VICP. This retroac - tive coverage includes both currently covered vaccines and childhood vaccines that are newly added. Anthrax and smallpox vaccines, as well as many travel vaccines, are not covered under the program because they are not in the routine schedule of childhood vaccines. Who may file a VICP claim? Any child or a parent, legal guardian, or trustee of an injured child or an incapacitated person may file a claim. A claim may be made for any injury or death thought to be a result of a covered vaccine. These injuries may include, but are not limited to: anaphylaxis, paralytic polio, and encephalopathy . Adults can apply for coverage if they received a covered vaccine. In addition, claims must be filed within a certain time frame. For specific filing information and deadlines please go to the VICP website at: http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/ 1-26What is the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program?

Suggest wrapping site with plastic wrap during shower, then re - placing moist bandage with a dry bandage or allowing site to air dry. In addition, when not alone maintain cover - ing for at least 30 days (with complete healing of vaccination site) or longer if site still has scab or skin changes Avoid or minimize person-to-person contact with high-risk people who are otherwise medically exempt from smallpox immunization, including: People with atopic dermatitis or eczema now or in childhood People who are immune decient Wash your hands thoroughly before caring for infants younger than one year of age and young children. Avoid direct contact between the infant or child and the vaccination site. Be aware that virus imay be present until 30 days after vaccination or until site heals Do not touch the vaccination site If you touch the site by accident, wash your hands immediately and then clean clothing or towels/wash cloths. Wash your hands before and after dressing changes Do not let others (including pets) touch your vaccination site or materials that touched the site Keep site dry. Cover with waterproof bandage or plastic wrap when bathing. Avoid rubbing the site. Launder items that have touched the site with hot soapy water, taking care to avoid risk to others from contact with contaminated laundry. 2-402-41Location of vaccine administration *Follow package insert instructions carefully when reconstituting vaccine Usually over the deltoid upper arm; some prefer non-dominant arm (left if right handed or vice versa) Place low enough to allow for non-adhesive circumferential bandaging for those with hypersensitivity to standard bandage tape Although deltoid site preferred (encouraged), some may request alternative sites (not absolutely contraindicated) (e.g., forearm or lateral hip) Avoid locations that are hard to care for or associated with sweating or clothing irritation Do NOT vaccinate directly on old scar Avoid tattoo areas if possible Patient Preparation Note: With 2-person vaccination teams, this procedure may be performed by assistant who is completing the paper work while vaccinator is performing the procedure Ask the patient if they have received the educational materials, have any other questions, or have new information relevant to vaccination Position patient for comfort during procedure; avoid contact with vial Cleanse site with soap and water and let dry; if alcohol is used, make sure all alcohol has evaporated before skin punctures/jabs to avoid inactivating the vaccinia virus Mark a 1 cm area with 4 dots spaced at 1 cm in perpendicular diameter using a skin marking pen. Administer vaccine in the middle of this area.Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine (Continued) CDCMethod for Proper Administration Caution: Vaccine vial should be handled carefully to avoid contamination while opening and handling Use blue cool pack from refrigerator NOT freezer Use cooling NOT freezing tray with holder for vial Place vaccination low enough to allow for coban-like wrap if tape reaction occurs Steps for proper administration (WRAMC 2002) Wear gloves, particularly if not vaccinated or have broken skin on hands (not an absolute requirement) Position vial securely in a vial holder to avoid accidental tipping or skin contact Open sterile 4X4 gauze package so that sterile surface of package wrapper and gauze are conveniently located near vial Open vial and place stopper on its side on the sterile gauze; position to avoid accidental contact (e.g., with sleeve, hand) Open needle package, or have assistant open Dip bifurcated needle into vial, checking to make sure that fluid is held by surface tension between posts of needle. (Do NOT hold over head to inspect) Hold patient's upper arm with one hand under the arm pit area for maximum comfort Position the wrist of the hand holding the needle on the vaccine arm just below the marked area of administration so that the needle tips are perpendicular over skin area to be vaccinated Administer appropriate number of jabs counting (1-2-3 OR 1-2-3-4-5 three times) Discard needle in biohazard materials container Inspect vaccination area for evidence of adequate administration technique (see next card) If indicated, repeat administration steps Bandage after procedure is completedSmallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine (Continued) 2-42Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine (Continued) Data Recording Patient Specic SF 601 Immunization Record PHS 731 Yellow Shot Record DoD Smallpox Vaccination Administration Form DD Form 2766 Automated medical registry per service-specic guidelines/immunization tracking system Quality Assurance Step 1Before bandaging, inspect the vaccination site and make sure there is evidence of skin surface penetration: Trace blood or clear abrasion/breaks in skin surface Some evidence of blood under the skin (petechiae) Frank bleeding (may reflect too forceful technique) Note: If no evidence of skin penetration and if patient did not feel needle penetration (i.e., felt dull pressure sensation only), repeat procedure with NEW needle and same vaccine dose (3 or 15 jabs as appropriate) Quality Assurance Step 2 Maintain a Site-Specic Smallpox Vaccination Log Maintain log of smallpox vials, date opened, date discarded or moved to another location, site-specic vial tracking number (sequential) - keep for up to 7 years Patient-specic tracking: record name, date of administration, locally assigned site-patient specic smallpox vaccination number, site vial number Number of doses from each vial for accountability Track contamination or inactivation issues raised Vaccinator competence assessment & tracking TAKES should be greater than 95% Tips on Bandaging Avoiding autoinoculation and spread to contactsUse non-stick, breathable bandages unless draining. Vary bandage size to reduce tape irritation. Use latex- free products. Consider using skin protector to decrease tape irritation on sensitive skin. Sleep with covering to protect against spread. Latest recommendation: Continue to cover the site with non-sticking bandage for 30 days making sure surface remains dry. Patient teaching is critical.

Additional informationis available at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/recs/child-schedule.htm. Any dose not administered at the recommended age should be administered at any subsequent visit, when indicated and feasible. Additional vaccines may be licensed and recommended during the year. Licensed combination vaccines may be used whenever any components of the combination are indicated andother components of the vaccine are not contraindicated and if approved by the Food and DrugAdministration for that dose of the series. Providers should consult the respective Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices statement for detailed recommendations. Clinically significant adverse events that follow immunization should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse EventReporting System (VAERS). Guidance about how to obtain and complete a VAERS form is available at http://www.vaers ,hhs.gov or by telephone, 800-822-7967 .3-4 The Recommended Immunization Schedules for Persons Aged 0-18 Years are approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Pract ices (http://www.cdc.gov/nip/acip ), the American Academy of Pediatrics ( http://www.aap.org), and the American Academy of Family Physicians ( http://www.aafp.org ).1. Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB). (Minimum age: birth) At birth: Administer monovalent HepB to all newborns before hospital discharge. If mother is hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive, administer HepB and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. If mother's HBsAg status is unknown, administer HepB within 12 hours of birth. Determine the HBsAg status as soon as possible and if HBsAg-positive, administer HBIG (no later than age 1 week). If mother is HBsAg-negative, the birth dose can only be delayed with physician's order and mother's negative HBsAg laboratory report documented in the infant's medical record. After the birth dose: The HepB series should be completed with either monovalent HepB or a combination vaccine containing HepB. The second dose should be administered at age 1-2 months. The final dose should be administeredat age 24 weeks. Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg after completion of 3 doses of a licensed HepB series, at age 9-18 months (generally at the next well-child visit). 4-month dose: It is permissible to administer 4 doses of HepB when combination vaccines are administered after the birth dose. If monovalent HepB is used for doses after the birth dose, a dose at age 4 months is not needed. 2. Rotavirus vaccine (Rota). (Minimum age: 6 weeks) Administer the first dose at age 6-12 weeks. Do not start the series later than age 12 weeks. Administer the final dose in the series by age 32 weeks. Do not admin- ister a dose later than age 32 weeks. Data on safety and efficacy outside of these age ranges are insufficient. 3. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP). (Minimum age: 6 weeks) The fourth dose of DTaP may be administered as early as age 12 months, provided 6 months have elapsed since the third dose. Administer the final dose in the series at age 4-6 years. 4.Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Hib). (Minimum age: 6 weeks) If PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB\u00aeor ComVax\u00ae[Merck]) is administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is not required. TriHiBit\u00ae(DTaP/Hib) combination products should not be used for primary immunization but can be used as boosters following any Hibvaccine in children aged 12 months.5. Pneumococcal vaccine. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for pneumococcal 2 years pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [PPV]) Administer PCV at ages 24-59 months in certain high-risk groups. Administer PPV to children aged 2 years in certain high-risk groups. SeeMMWR 2000;49(No. RR-9):1-35. 6. Influenza vaccine. (Minimum age: 6 months for trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [TIV]; 5 years for live, attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) All children aged 6-59 months and close contacts of all children aged 0-59 months are recommended to receive influenza vaccine. Influenza vaccine is recommended annually for children aged 59 months with certain risk factors, health-care workers, and other persons (including household members) in close contact with persons in groups at high risk. See MMWR 2006;55(No. RR-10):1-41. For healthy persons aged 5-49 years, LAIV may be used as an alternative to TIV. Children receiving TIV should receive 0.25 mL if aged 6-35 months or 0.5 mL if aged 3 years.

Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB). (Minimum age: birth) At birth: Administer monovalent HepB to all newborns before hospital discharge. If mother is hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive, administer HepB and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. If mother's HBsAg status is unknown, administer HepB within 12 hours of birth. Determine the HBsAg status as soon as possible and if HBsAg-positive, administer HBIG (no later than age 1 week). If mother is HBsAg-negative, the birth dose can only be delayed with physician's order and mother's negative HBsAg laboratory report documented in the infant's medical record. After the birth dose: The HepB series should be completed with either monovalent HepB or a combination vaccine containing HepB. The second dose should be administered at age 1-2 months. The final dose should be administeredat age 24 weeks. Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg after completion of 3 doses of a licensed HepB series, at age 9-18 months (generally at the next well-child visit). 4-month dose: It is permissible to administer 4 doses of HepB when combination vaccines are administered after the birth dose.
