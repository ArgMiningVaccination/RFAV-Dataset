We, therefore, need a constant supply of this essential mineral daily by either incorporating natural sources of foods that have high magnesium content in our diet, such as: - Green leafy vegetables (e.g. spinach and kale) - Fruit (figs, avocado, banana and raspberries) - Nuts and seeds. - Legumes (black beans, chickpeas and kidney beans) - Vegetables (peas, broccoli, cabbage, green beans, artichokes, asparagus, brussels sprouts) - Seafood (salmon, mackerel, tuna) or alternatively as a magnesium supplement. Did you know that magnesium is involved in over 350 biochemical reactions in the body that helps to support your heart, nervous system, bones, muscles, and the brain? It's often not until our bodies force us to realise something is out of balance do we take notice as we begin to suffer with symptoms of: Fatigue and Muscle Weakness, Muscle Twitches and Cramps, Irregular Heartbeat and Osteoporosis to name but a few symptoms of magnesium deficiency. This should highlight that we need to make some immediate changes to our lifestyles. If this is you, then you need to take action now. The NHS recommends male and females consume 270-300mg of magnesium every day. The UK Government's National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2008, found due to poor dietary and lifestyle choices, prolonged stress and excessive exercise, magnesium as a daily nutrient is in decline. Many of us are simply not getting enough of this essential mineral magnesium so, a supplement may be required. According to Bioglan, the benefits of magnesium can be discovered by people who are restless sleepers, who regularly exercise, the elderly and workers who are stressed and work long hours. The new Active Magnesium range from Bioglan allows customer to choose the format that suits their objective, life stage and goals: Active Magnesium tablets When we receive products to review here at The Energy Healing Magazine they often highlight the importance of maintaining a balance in our bodies to ensure maximum health and well-being. I've personally made a conscious effort to change my lifestyle/diet over the past two months upon receiving this range. I've now tried all of the new Active Magnesium range from Bioglan due to the fact that I am normally a restless sleeper - the menopause doesn't help. I also exercise 4/5 times a week and work long stressful hours. I've found these products have been hugely beneficial to me. I can report that taking Active Magnesium Tablets for a month worked really well for me. They are an easy shape to swallow and convenient to use; one tablet with breakfast each morning. I found I slept better, felt less anxious and I didn't suffer from being woken by cramp in the night. I felt so much more refreshed upon waking. I will definitely go back to this product now I've reviewed the other formulas too. I loved the fact that Bioglan have taken into consideration that not everyone can or like taking tablets. This is where Active Magnesium Powder can work for you. A pleasant taste of lemon & lime flavour one scoop mixed in 200mls of water, I took this with my breakfast. Same outcome as above after taking for 3 weeks. I found I did struggle with using the Active Magnesium Cream. Whilst the directions on packaging advised to use a small amount I was not quite sure how much this meant to receive my daily dosage. So, I applied 2cms of this cream to my forearms after my daily shower. While the menthol may help with the absorption of the cream into the skin it does have quite a strong aroma that did not go well with my perfume. I then changed my routine to applying Active Magnesium Cream before bed. My husband was not a huge fan of the menthol in bed, so applied the cream to my feet instead. If you don't mind the menthol fragrance then this could be the choice for you. Personally this did not work for me. If you'd like to purchase any of The New Active Magnesium Range from Bioglan they can be found on this [website](https://bioglan.co.uk/) These products are also suitable for vegetarians and vegans. Highly recommended by the team here at The Energy Healing Magazine. "}
