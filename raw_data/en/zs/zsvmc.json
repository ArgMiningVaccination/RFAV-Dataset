The water-loving tree can't be missed when its vibrant pink flowers are in full bloom. For many generations, South and Central American people have used this potent yet gentle plant to open their hearts up to greater self-love and love for others. The tender spirit of this plant is said to increase empathy, activate intuition, and aid in clairvoyance, emotional release, and connection to dream time. Bobinsana's traditional uses also include hunting endurance, improved vision, appetite suppression, increased creativity, and mental clarity. The chemical constituents in Bobinsana are not well documented but it is believed to contain harmala alkaloids that cause its effects. ESOTERIC CHARACTER Celestial Ruler: Neptune Element: Water Energetics: Sweet, Warm Meridians/Organs: Heart, Lung Bobinsana is a revered healer who encourages the purging of limiting beliefs and inspires a heart-centered perception. \"She\" is often referred to as \"Sirenita del Los Rios,\" which translates to mermaid of the rivers because she brings the feminine energy of the water to open and heal the heart. With roots 7 times as deep as she is tall, she helps ground our bodies in the present. She illuminates any wounds in the mental and emotional bodies that make relationships with self or others difficult and transforms our egoic thinking into compassion and healthy boundaries. Bobinsana supports us while we process our grief, loss, heartbreak, and other emotions. Every personal rejection, job loss, failed romance, betrayal, and regret, creates a sense of loss. Misplaced hopes and unmanifested dreams leave holes in our hearts. When we find ourselves trapped in emotions it can undermine the immune system and lead to illness, physically and psychologically. Our hearts are our ultimate guides through all of our life situations. When we are in our hearts, we are solidly living in our own essential truth no matter what is happening in the world around us. For this Sound Bath and Tea Ceremony, please bring your blanket, pillow, mug and journal with pen. We encourage these items to have sentimental value if possible. |Ticket Information||Ticket "}
