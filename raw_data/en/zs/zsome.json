Charting Responsible Growth Washington, DC Thursday, MAY 12, 2022 For nearly 25 years, Ars Technica has explored the many frontiers of technology, law, and culture. But today, those frontiers have coalesced. Fields that once seemed separate are now linked by their deep reliance on digital technology to solve domain-specific problems. Over the course of a day, live and in-person from Washington, DC, our inaugural Ars Frontiers event will explore the modern interconnectedness of innovation in areas like space exploration & climate change, cryptography & privacy, and machine learning & digital security. As we do so, we will keep asking one key question: Can we still drive explosive growth in these fields while prioritizing ethical behavior and sustainability? Ars Frontiers is an event by invitation.

What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? There's an AI revolution happening. With Alphabet's AlphaCode, AI can now turn problem descriptions into code, generate solutions, and filter out the bad ones.

Thanks to rapid advances, mRNA vaccines are now a thing\u2014and they can be used on a lot more than COVID. Then there's the entire topic of gene therapy\u2014once we can get mRNA into cells, we can potentially target genetic diseases, which is huge. What's on the horizon now? Featuring Dr. Karin Bok and Dr. Nathaniel Wang. Moderated by John Timmer. 01:35pm ET 02:10pm ET 02:45pm ET 03:20pm ET 04:30pm ET Opening remarks from Ars Technica Editor-in-Chief, Ken Fisher Internet Everywhere: Satellites Are Suddenly Sexy Starlink could not have had better PR than its use in Ukraine, where it has been crucial to maintaining connections in the field. Amazon is following with a constellation of its own, and China's not far behind. What does the prospect of fast, low-latency Internet anywhere on earth mean for travelers and locals around the globe? What do tens of thousands of orbiting sats mean for our skies, and the new space industry that will launch them? Is the problem of orbital clutter and debris manageable? Featuring Alex Fielding, Bhavya Lal, and Charity Weeden. Moderated by Eric Berger. Pandemic Lessons From Epidemiologists Now that we have a small amount of distance from the event, what can we learn from the global response to COVID-19? What preparations are being made for the next pandemic? Will mRNA as a vaccine platform change the world? A panel of leading epidemiologists share thoughts and lessons. Featuring Jennifer Nuzzo and Dr. Caitlin Rivers. Moderated by Beth Mole. The Lightning Onset of AI \u2014 What Suddenly Changed? It feels like the list of things that AI can successfully do has exploded within the past few months. A year ago, few people had heard of \"ChatGPT,\" and now generated text (and images! and video!) is everywhere. What exactly has happened in the past few years to enable this apparent quantum leap? Featuring Paige Bailey and Haiyan Zhang. Moderated by Benj Edwards. TikTok \u2014 Banned or Not, It's Probably Here to Stay Although Congress is exploring a TikTok ban, the reality is that TikTok users almost certainly won't take it seriously and the app is as popular as ever. What do the experts say about the situation, and how likely is the ban to actually happen? Featuring Bryan Cunningham, Corynne McSherry and Ioana Literat. Moderated by Ashley Belanger. What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? There's an AI revolution happening. With Alphabet's AlphaCode, AI can now turn problem descriptions into code, generate solutions, and filter out the bad ones. Large language models are currently able to solve about one-third of assigned problems. How will LLMs scale, and will we eventually be relying on computers instead of humans to write software? Featuring Drew Lohn and Katie Moussouris. Moderated by Lee Hutchinson. Sessions *Sessions subject to change Closing Remarks 05:00 Closing Remarks 05:00pm ET Click Here to Tune IN "}
