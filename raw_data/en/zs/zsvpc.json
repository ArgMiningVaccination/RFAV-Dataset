The Meaning of Yoga \"Yoga\" originally comes from the Sanskrit word \"yuj\", meaning \"union.\" Though it is often interpreted from the outside as merely an array of stretches and poses, this discipline can have incredible life-changing effects on the health of your mind and body. The union of breath, body, and mind creates physical strength and flexibility, fosters creative thought and insight, and calms the nervous system while cleansing the body's organs.

Focusing on correct alignment and breathing, classes are therapeutic, rehabilitative, and meditative, allowing you to access the deeper layers that calm the mind, open the body, and uplift the spirit. 60 min sessions are $180 for one or two people. Hatha Yoga Hatha is an ancient traditional form of yoga that incorporates the practice of asanas (yoga postures) and pranayama (breathing exercises), to help bring peace, strength, and flexibility to the mind and body. Hatha yoga is ideal for beginners and experienced yogis interested in gentle and slow sequencing. This meditation in motion invites the student to learn and deeply understand the subtleties and benefits of each pose. Fitness Yoga Fitness yoga is an invigorating style that will get your body sweating and blood flowing, while allowing you to target particular areas of the body in need of strengthening, toning, and stretching. With dynamic personalized sequences, synchronized with deep, mindful breathing, fitness yoga can get you back on track with your fitness goals, and set you up for a successful week, physically and mentally. Yin Yoga Yin is a slow-paced style in which key postures are held between 3-5 minutes. In this passive, yet deep exploration, the body is given time and space to fully surrender to the physical and emotional healing available in each pose. This practice allows you to safely stretch and release muscles, connective tissue, and deep layers of the fascia, which promotes circulation in the joints and improves flexibility.

Doing yoga not only gives children a chance to play but an opportunity to connect more deeply with oneself, encouraging the inner light that all children have to shine brightly. Learning yoga at a young age helps develop positive habits that will serve as life-long tools to promote concentration, self-awareness, and physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Prenatal Yoga Prenatal yoga is a wonderful way to safely maintain strength and flexibility during pregnancy and to prepare the mind and body for the experience of childbirth. Focusing on poses that ease discomfort and promote deep breathing, prenatal yoga encourages relaxation and mental focus for a more comfortable labor. Celebrate this special moment of life by keeping mom and baby happy, healthy, and relaxed. Restorative Yoga Restorative is a gentle and deeply relaxing style in which postures are held for an extended time. This slow and passive practice tranquilizes the nervous system and allows the body and mind to rest and heal. This style makes use of a wide range of props, including bolsters, blocks, straps, and blankets. In this way, each pose is perfectly supported, making it easier to completely let go both physically and emotionally.
