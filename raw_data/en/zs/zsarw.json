Thank You! [NadjaLind.com](https://NadjaLind.com) \"Inner Expedition - Elemental Medicine for the Soul\" You are blissfully floating down a calm river in the middle of a majestic rain forest, where the majesty of nature is at its most empathic. A relaxing purr drifts up from a wholesome cat next to you in the boat, and you feel its presence and warmth pleasant and reassuring. Your eyes are shielded by a canopy made from a hundred shades of green, the dappled sunlight caresses your skin as you taste the freshly oxygenated air on your lips, breathing deep into your lungs and letting its life-giving vitality courses throughout your body. Mystical drums tumble around from afar, blending with the chirrup of cicadas while water tickles the side of the boat as it slowly meanders its way through the jungle. Rainbow bright birds sing beautifully from overhead and every synapse fires sparks of dopamine throughout your body and projects into a cocoon of pure energy. Your connection deepens with every movement as you begin to ride the layers of exquisite audio while ASMR sound effects gently tickling your eardrums sending a pleasant shiver of excitement and joy down your spine - one moment you are focused on the water, the next the drums emanating from the trees, and then over to the birds overhead. There is no urgency, just blissful contemplation and a purr at your feet. \"Turning in 17 - Inner Expedition\" is like medicine for the Soul and another powerful, transformational album of Nadja Lind's \"Turning in\" healing frequencies.
