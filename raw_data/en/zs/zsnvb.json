Executive Summary In its 2022 session, the Washington Legislature included a budget proviso in SB 5693 (2021- 2023 fiscal biennium supplemental operating appropriations ) that directed the Health Care Authority (HCA) to provide a report on psilocybin services and opportunitie s in consultation with a group of specified stakeholders. An excerpt of SB 5693 can be found in Appendix A. The Stakeholder Workgroup has been tasked to: 1. Review the Oregon Health Authority's proposed rules for the regulation of psilocybin and assess the im pact the adoption of substantially similar laws and rules or Senate Bill No. 5660 would have in Washington state, and identify specific areas where a different approach may be necessary or desirable; 2. Review systems and procedures established by the liquor and cannabis board to monitor manufacturing, testing, and tracking of cannabis to determine suitability and adaptations required for use with psilocybin if Washington adopts legislation substantially similar to the Oregon psilocybin services act or Senate Bill No. 5660; 3. Review the social opportunity program proposed in Senate Bill No. 5660 for the purpose of recommending improvements or enhancements to promote equitable access to a potential legal psilocybin industry within an operable administrative framework ; 4. Assess functional requirements of Senate Bill No. 5660 that would exceed the expertise and capacity of the Department of Health and identify opportunities for development or collaboration with o ther state agencies and entities to meet the requirements; and 5. Discuss options to integrate licensed behavioral health professionals into the practice of psilocybin therapy under the framework of Senate Bill No. 5660 where appropriate. The Washington Legi slature specified that the S takeholder Work group be chaired by the Director of HCA or her designee and the group shall consist of: the director of the liquor and cannabis board or designee the director of the department of agriculture or designee the fo llowing representatives with knowledge of psilocybin: o a military veteran, or similar o up to two recognized indigenous practitioners o an individual with expertise in disability rights advocacy o a member of the nursing profession o a psychologist o a mental healt h counselor, marriage and family therapist, or social worker o a physician a health researcher with expertise in health equity a representative of the cannabis industry with knowledge of regulation of cannabis businesses in Washington an advocate from the L GBTQIA community with knowledge of the experience of behavioral health issues within that community a member of the psychedelic medicine alliance of Washington up to two members with lived experience of utilizing psilocybin Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 6 The Stakeholder Workgroup membership can be found in Appendix B. HCA contracted with the Center for Evidence- based Policy (\"the Center\") to provide technical assistance in support of this project , manage and facilitate th e Stakeholder Workg roup , and draft two reports summarizing the Sta keholder Work group's deliberations to be submitted to the Legislature by HCA.

Specific feedback on Oregon's Measure 109 was gathered through a survey before the first workgroup meeting and a facilitated discussion was conducted during the meeting. Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 14 Key Themes from Meeting #1 (June 2022) In advance of the first workgroup meeting , the Center surveyed workgroup participants on their thoughts related to a potential regulatory framework for Washington and their familiarity with Oregon's psilocybin program. The results of this survey are summarized in the Survey Findings section below and full results are included in Appendix E. Themes arising from discussion of the survey are summarized in the Discussion Themes section below. Survey Fin dings Fourteen of the 20 w orkgroup participants responded to the survey. Most respondents were familiar with Oregon's psilocybin model with only two respondents saying they were not familiar with the model. Results are shown below. Elements of Oregon's model that members want to duplicate: 2-year implementation period General satisfaction with facilitator licensing and training design Requiring only a high -school diploma for admission to training programs Promote access to psilocybin during end -of-life care Elements of Oregon's model that members want to avoid or modify: Lack of policy and procedure around microdosing Required on -site consumption o Workgroup members would like to recommend an allowance for at -home administration for people with mob ility access issues Members would like to include exemptions for personal, religious, or indigenous use which is not included in Oregon's policy Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 15 Prohibition of interstate transport Members would like to include more protections for equitable access and inc orporate cost analysis to ensure sessions remain affordable for average consumer Designing Washington's Psilocybin Program Workgroup members were asked to prioritize categories based on their level of importance in shaping a future psilocybin program in Wa shington. Results were: Workgroup members were also offered the chance to add categories they would like to see prioritized in the design of Washington's psilocybin program. Additional recommendations were: Research Respecting indigenous practices Equity, access, and affordability could be combine d or defined as separate priorities Safety and clinical effectiveness also might have overlapping qualities that need to be defined Flexible regulation that allows for innovation Opportunities in Designing Psilocybin Program Could be solution to unmet needs of psychiatric conditions Potential to improve mental health and wellbeing of Washingtonians Reduction of crime and prevention of mental illness Washington could serve as thought l eader for other states looking to improve upon Oregon's model Could simplify or clarify regulation to allow for enhanced research and innovation Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 16 Challenges and Concerns in Designing Psilocybin Program Department of Health would have no framework for approving controlled substance registration applications Cost-accessibility issues Interaction with behavioral health license boards How to ensure diversity of practitioners to meet population needs Developing regulatory framework for growth and manufacturing and safety assurance when dealing with schedule 1 substance Developing regulatory framework that allows for research and innovation Discussion Themes Workgroup participants emphasized the following areas of interest and future development of psilocybi n regulation in Washington. Additional Policy Scope Concerns Washington should consider how microdosing practices could occur in system Washington should consider decriminalization efforts in tandem with any state model Washington s hould look to other sta tes for their decriminalization policies Feedback on Oregon Model Positive feedback on Oregon's facilitator education requirement of high school diploma only Mixed feedback on Oregon's limitation to one species only Designing Washington's Psilocybin Progra m Any recommendations in the final report should be broad and consider all population s (dual diagnoses, wellness, spirituality, post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), etc.) Have explicit regulatory language that psilocybin training programs do not need approval from Washington's Student Achievement Council Consider designing a tiered training program designed for different populations: o General wellness o Spiritual experience o Dual behavioral health diagnoses Washington should offer variety of facilitator train ing programs to prioritize access and safety Other Workgroup Suggestions Safety concerns related to interactions with other pharmaceuticals Recommendation that workgroup specifically define equity, access, and affordability Need time to circle back on workforce considerations like discussions with state licensure boards for practitioners Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 17 Workgroup Task 2: Review systems and procedures established by the liquor and cannabis board to monitor manufacturing, testing, and tracking of cannabis to determine s uitability and adaptations required for use with psilocybin if Washington adopts legislation substantially like the Oregon psilocybin services act or Senate Bill No. 5660 Action taken The second workgroup meeting, held on August 4, 2022, featured a presen tation by Jim Morgan, Chief Financial Officer for the Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board (LCB). The presentation included an overview of the history of cannabis tracking systems in the state and highlighted key similarities and potential differences between psilocybin and cannabis. The following is a summary of the LCB's presentation: History of Tracking Systems First system wa s a pharmaceutical tracking system that was rebranded and repack aged for cannabis but didn't meet the needs of LCB's program. Second system was challenging in terms of usability and support and was more complicated than needed. System went beyond what was required in statute and rule. The current system launched in December 2021 . It was built by LCB (aka a home -grown system) and designed specifically to meet required regulatory responsibilit ies. The LCB reviewed statute, rules, and what was necessary to mee t overarching goals when designing the system. o Current system has a database that was developed to collect data from licensees every week o Licensees submit comma -separated value (CSV) files and upload through an online portal o System conducts initial error checking and validation on CSV files before accepting licensee submission o The LCB can run queries from the database and produce reports Similarities Between Cannabis and Psilocybin Tracking Licensing procedures will be necessary and will need to be tailor ed for different industry participants (manufacturers, facilitators, etc.) Both are Schedule 1 drugs Differences Between Cannabis and Psilocybin Tracking: When regulating cannabis, LCB is regulating a commercial, retail industry. Psilocybin may not use a retail model. Cannabis is processed into wide range of commercial products to be sold through 500 retailers to anyone over 21 . Medical cannabis is directed toward medical patients but is still sold through retail stores . A majority of LCB's cannabis process es are around licensing, regulatory compliance, and collecting taxes from licensees. Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 18 Workgroup Feedback Key Themes from Meeting #2 (August 2022) In addition to the presentation from the LCB, the second workgroup meeting included a facilitated discussion of survey responses from the workgroup members. The survey was sent out ahead of time and major findings are described below. Survey Findings Thirteen of the 20 workgroup members responded to the survey that was sent out in advance of the second workgroup meeting . The survey was designed using discussion themes from the first workgroup meeting including priority issues raised by members when discuss ing how Washington could adapt Oregon's Measure 109 approach . Topics included microdosing policies, clinical vs. wellness model, training program structures, insurance coverage options, and design and implementation of Oregon's Measure 109. A summary is below, and full results are in Appendix F . Microdosing: There was strong support for including a recommendation in the final report on microdosing procedures and policies with average support being 4.0 out of 5.0 Possible policies including reducing wait ing period during implementation session and allowing microdoses to be obtained only through qualified providers like cannabis retail stores Clinical vs. wellness model: Workgroup members preferred recommending a wellness model over a clinical model for psilocybin. The average support ranking for a wellness model was 4.2 (out of 5.0) and the ranking for a clinical model was 2.61 (out of 5.0 ) Respondents noted that a clinical model would better address equity issues related to access Another respondent a dvocated for both models - wellness model for sessions with less than 3 grams of psilocybin and clinical model for sessions with more than 3 grams Some respondents noted they would agree with a medical model if it was the only option for implementation Training program structures: Respondents were mixed on their support for a tiered training structure designed to targeted different populations (general wellness, spiritual experiences, mental health diagnoses, etc.). The average support ranking of the group was 3.61 (out of 5.0) Workgroup members pointed out there was no research support for tiered training There was support for following Oregon's training model of allowing anyone with a high- school diploma to complete training Insurance coverage options: Support was high for including a recommendation in the final report that psilocybin be covered by private insurance and had an average ranking of 4.38 (out of 5.0) . Support was also high for including a recommendation i n the report that Medicaid explor e legal and financial policies for covering psilocybin sessions with state funding. The average support ranking was 4.54 (out of 5.0) . Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 19 Design and implementation of Oregon's Measure 109: Workgroup members showed favorable support (average ranking of at least 3.5 o ut of 5.0) for the following aspects of Oregon's Measure 109 design and implementation: o 2-year implementation period ; o passing decriminalization policy concurrently ; and o requiring only a high school diploma for facilitators . Workgroup members showed less than favorable support (average ranking of less than 3.5 out of 5.0) for the following aspects of Oregon's Measure 109 design and implementation: limiting to P.cubensis species of psilocybin only ; limiting consumption to on -site only ; not including exemptions for religious, personal, or indigenous use; and not specifically targeting populations with addiction, PTSD, and end -of-life diagnoses. Discussion Themes Workgroup participants emphasized the following areas of intere st during the second workgroup meeting . Discussion between workgroup members was related to Oregon's psilocybin program and how the model should or shouldn't be changed to apply to Washington. A summary of key themes is below. Equity considerations Could we look to international studies for example of equity models Washington has history in courts related to religious and spiritual freedom which will be important to pay attention to within this area Need to consider how workforce short ages may also impact access Microdosing policy Potential policy consideration for allowing individuals to access microdose s through a service center and not requiring administration on -site at the service center Decriminalization of psilocybin would help a ddress microdosing Would need to consider regulatory framework of microdosing policy if the workgroup wants to include it in the final report o One suggestion was to make microdoses available by prescription only Clinical vs. w ellness model The wellness mode l includes access to the clinical model but not the other way around so the state should make the gate as big as possible If the Workgroup does support the wellness model it will be met with questions on if the wellness model is consistent with having to go to specific locations for psilocybin journey Whatever model is recommended the state need ways to capture data long -term so we can see effects to target treatments Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 20 Tiered training structure There needs to be training specific to populations - for example if someone with complex PTSD has an episode during the session o Oregon is looking at increasing hours or building offshoot programs for specialization, but Washington should consider what people are looking for, what needs of cli ents are, and what the scope is for facilitators Underground and ceremonial experience should be considered for training program requirements Need to consider if licensed medical professionals can lose license for participating in state training programs ( as may be the case in Oregon) Insurance Coverage Action that requires DEA rescheduling or approval should not be considered Look to ketamine clinics around the country doing drug -assisted sessions and if insurance can be used for certain sections of that clinical process o Look to Colorado who created partnerships with Medicaid to cover ketamine services State Legislative Summary The second workgroup meeting also featured a presentation by the Center regarding 21 state legislative actions or ballot initiatives related to psilocybin programs. A summary of the legislation can be found below with full details in Appendix G .

Eight bills have passed and are now law, among them 4 advisory workgroup bills, 2 research bills, 1 decriminalization bill, and 1 ballot initiative focused on facilitated psychedelic -assisted therapy (PAT). Five bills are a ctive in committee and have either passed in one legislative chamber or are pending a state ballot. Of the remaining 8 bills, 3 received substantive legislative support and we re pushed to the next session for further review . Oregon's Ballot Measure 109 to authorize facilitated PAT was the first to pass in November of 2020, followed by New Jersey's decriminalization bill in December 2020. Texas' research bill and Connecticut's study group bill passed in 2021, and bills in Maryland, Oklahoma, Utah, and Washin gton in 2022. Despite the surge of state action in recent years , few of these 21 bills and ballot initiatives use similar language , with the following exceptions: New York, Maine, and Washington 's bills have some similarity to Oregon's Measure 109. Florida 's bill is a near copy of the 2021 bill passed in Texas . Notably, m uch of the psychedelic legislation introduced to date has bipartisan co -sponsors and support from both parties . Legislation in Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, New Hampshire, Okla homa, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Utah received bipartisan support while bills in Florida, Rhode Island , and Maine were met with Republican opposition . The bipartisan support for psychedelic legislation, paired with the speed with which these bills have been introduced into state legislatures, suggests that additional states are likely to introduce their own legislation. This analysis covers the existing 21 state bills and ballot initiatives introduced as of July 2022, and summarizes themes in the following 7 areas: Psychedelic Substances Considered for Approval Research Directive Public Availability and Target Diagnosis Bill Model and Goal Equity Approach Decriminalization Directives Funding Approach The analysis does not examine the available evidence on psychedelic therapy but focuses only on state legislative and ballot activity. Appendix A provides detail about each state's bill or ballot initiative including citations and a link to the original bill or ballot initiative. Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 66 Psychedelic Substances Under Consideration There was significant variation among states regarding which psychedelic substances were included in the bill or ballot initiative. Psilocybin or its equivalent, psilocyn, was the sole t herapeutic drug up for approval in 12 bills focused on therapeutic use, decriminalization, or research. Other states took a broader approach to inclusion of psychedelic drugs (Table 1) \u2014these can be separated into 3 general categories with slight variations from state to state: the term natural medicine acknowledge p eyote's vulnerable status, and its importance to certain First Nation traditions , but p eyote is generally banned from production or consumption in these bills. Therapeutic Medicine s\u2014 3,4-methylenedioxy -methamphetamine (MDMA) , psilocybin, ketamine. These three drugs have some research supporting therapeutic efficacy and are farthest along in the FDA approval process . Psychedelic This category is the most inclusive of the three and does not exclude notable psychedelics . In some cases, bill wording leaves op portunity for other substances to be added if approved by research institutions, an advisory board , or a state agency. Notable variations in substance approval include Rhode Island 's bill that proposes to allow possession of buprenorphine (a pharmacotherapeutic for heroin and methadone dependence) and psilocybin, and Utah 's bill that makes no mention of any psychedelic substance, leaving th e decision of substance approval to its advisory board . Notably, none of the 21 state bills and ballot initiatives analyzed include any mention of a microdosing facilitation or research plan. Psychedelic microdosing is repeated use of small sub-therapeutic doses, such as 10 -20mcg of LSD or less th an 1-3 mg of psilocybin.1 Research Directive Sixteen state bills include some form of research directive with 11 of those states proposing establishment of an advisory board or workgroup. Advisory boards and workgroups are generally given a specified window of time to complete their review and issue a report to the governor or legislature , with Utah having the nearest advisory report due date of October 31, 2022. These a dvisory groups have some common membership composition requirements across states, often specifying i ndividuals with experience in therapy, medicine, public health, drug regulation, and substance abuse treatment as members. Another 6 membership categories were common among states, including: Indigenous rights \u2014California, Colorado, Maine, Oregon, Washington Equity \u2014Colorado, Maine, New York, Oregon, Washington Law enforcement , first responders \u2014California, Colorado Harm reduction \u2014California, Colorado, Maine, New York, Oregon, Utah, Washington Veterans \u2014Colorado, New York, Washington Agriculture \u2014Colorado, Maine, Oregon, Washington Three states included notable advisory b oard membership category requirements outside the listed criteria a bove : Oregon \u2014includes a member experienced in the legalization of cannabis Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 67 California \u2014includes a member experienced in youth drug use control and education Washington \u2014includes several additional member requirements : o a member experienced in end of life and palliative care o a member experienced in the cannabis legalization process o members with the lived experience of using psychedelics o a LBQTQIA advocate o disability rights advocate Connecticut, Georgia, and Pennsylvania's bills do not include the same type of required memberships categories. Rather, Connecticut 's bill states that 9 m embers are to be appointed by various government officials, without reference to specific qualifications or areas of expertise . Georgia 's bill proposes an advisory group c omposed of 6 members, 3 of them veterans, 2 House of Representatives members, and 1 Department of Health member . Finally, Pennsylvania proposed to employ an existing committee, t he Health Research Advisory Committee (HRAC) , to a dvise on psychedelic implementation . Many of the bills leave psychedelic research oversight to a specific branch of government, usually the state's Department of Health (DoH), but some states selected other agencies or organizations: Connecticut \u2014Departmen t of Mental Health and Addiction Services Georgia \u2014House Committee on Defense and Veterans Affairs Missouri \u2014Department of Health and Senior Services Texas \u2014Texas Medical Board States not employing an advisory board model typically partner with outside research institutions . Texas, for example, names the Baylor College of Medicine as its research partner, and Maryland names Johns Hopkins and the citizen advocacy nonprofit , Brainfutures , in its legislation. Other states offer licenses to research institutions for the production, synthesis, and testing of psychedelics , with bills in Oklahoma, New York, and Missouri proposing to allow eligible institutions to produce certain psychedelic drugs in - state for research purposes. Public Availability and T arget Diagnosis Many s tate bills and ballot measures contain eligibility requirements for individuals seeking PAT, such as age, type of employment, diagnosis, but the requirements vary greatly from state to state. This section will focus on legislation tha t contains a proposed psychedelic facilitation plan; this can be described as any proposal that allows an individual to take a psychedelic drug under supervision in a licensed facility. Age is one of the threshold criteria. N early all state proposals require a minimum age of 21 years, Oklahoma is the notable exception with a minimum age of 18 years . Of the states with a facilitation plan proposal, 6 allow for all individuals above 21 to be treated without a diagnosis or doctors approval. These state bills and ballot measures are oriented towards a wellness model where psychedelic therapy would be offered outside a traditional medical structure. Veterans and their associated diagnoses are another focus area for eligibility. Georgia and Maryland limit psyche delic treatment to veterans while Connecticut limits treatment to veterans, first responders, and healthcare workers . Georgia allows for vet erans with PTSD, major depressive disorder, and substance use disorder to be treated , while Maryland limits treatmen t to veterans with PTSD and traumatic brain injuries . Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 68 Even though Connecticut limits treatment to veterans, first responders, and healthcare workers , the state legislation does not require a medical diagnosis. Another 7 state proposals pursue a medical or research model and list a variety of diagnoses in bill or ballot measure language. These states include depression as a diagnosis eligible for treatment, and most include anxiety and PTSD . From this point there is variation among the states as s ubstance u se disorder, traumatic brain injury, bipolar disorder, end -of-life treatment, migraines, and chronic pain are scattered among different bills, depending on the focus of each piece of legislation. Oklahoma makes the distinction of \"treatment -resistant\" status for anxiety and depression , which would exclude a greater population from treatment . Despite finite lists of diagnoses seen in many state bills and ballot initiatives, Missouri, New York, and Pennsylvania all have clauses allowing for petition or furth er determinations by the state DoH or advisory boards to consider other conditions. Washington and Utah do not specify any diagnosis, and leave the decision of public availability to the workgroup or future legislative action . Equity Approach Eleven states mention equity in proposed legislation but vary in the degree of practical implementation guidance for facilitating accessible and affordable therapy. Decriminalization bills, which are generally oriented towards improving equity, are not included in this section; see Decriminalization Directives below for more information . California, Colorado, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington include the most detail and direction in their bill or ballot measure language calling for an advisory board to investigate the accessibility and affordability of the proposed psychedelic therapy facilitation plan. The equity section of these state bills and ballot initiatives is short, outlining equity as a priority, but mak ing no further mention of equity, insurance coverage, cost -reimbursement, minority ownership, etc. Only Colorado , Washington, and New York have designated members on the advisory board specifically focused on and experienced in equitable health policy . The remaining states have a more limited or unique approach to equity. Hawaii and Maine call for the program to be \"safe, accessible, and affordable\", but outline no proces s or directive to achieve this goal. Maryland has a \"$1 million, non -lapsing fund\" that would cover the treatment of all eligible veterans in the state if implemented. Missouri explicitly outlines that health care insurers and the D epartment of Corrections cannot be required to cover psychotherapy drug treatment , but does explicitly state that associated treatment or therapy can covered by insurance. A subcommittee in Oregon has been formed by the Measure 109 advisory board specifically to address equity. More recently, Oregon SB 1580 has been pushed to next session; if passed in 2023, a 15- member task force \"The Task Force on Psilocybin Health Equity\" would be created to study health equity as it relates to psilocybin facilitation. Lastly, i n Washington's 2021- 22 SB 5660, which did not pass, the state introduced the Social Opportunity Program (SOP) . Despite the bill not passing, the SOP is now being studied by the Washington State advisory workgroup for its applicability to the state's emerging psilocybin program. As outlined in Section 115 of SB 5660, the primary goal of the program is to identify distressed areas and offer assistance to individuals and entities within distressed areas who qualify by including reduced psilocybin therapy center Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 69 license fees and enhanced scoring for licensing application s. The bill outlines criteria for distressed areas and SOP applicants, which is summarized below. A distressed area is categori zed as such by the Washington State Department of Labor and/or where: o 50% of child ren participate in free lunch o 20% of households are under federal supplemental nutrition assistance program A SOP applicant is : o an entity where at least 51% of ownership is with individuals that have lived in a distressed area for 5 of the last 10 years o an entity where more than half of its employees reside in a distressed area The SOP remains open -ended to allow for other criteria and benefits to be added as seen fit by the department Washington's proposed SOP is the most detailed of the existing equity proposals. If new legislation in Washington passes with the SOP included, states should observe its implementation to determine the impact on creating equitable health policy. Decriminalization Directives State -level decriminalization is an essential ste p for psychedelic therapy. It is critical to note, however, that aside from ketamine, all other psychedelic drugs mentioned in this analysis remain illegal at the federal level. Federal fines and criminal action can still be applied even if a state decriminalizes a psychedelic drug. Interaction of state and federal law is complicated, and it is often left to the current President's administration to determine the degree to which federal law will be pursued when in conflict with state law. Nonetheless, feder al illegality of psychedelic drugs has serious impacts for PAT business viability as it relates to tax breaks, loans, and other legal and financial considerations. Therefore, decriminalization remains a top priority for many states looking to move forward with psychedelic therapy. Three distinct decriminalization categories can be identified from existing legislation, which are outlined below. Of the existing legislation, 7 have possession bills, 2 have reclassification bills, and 3 have broad decriminaliz ation bills. Possession bills are the most common approach to decriminalization. Requirements for jail time and felony charges for low levels of possession of an illegal psychedelic drug are removed, with a small fine being left as a punitive measure. Poss ession bills seek to decriminalize the drug in most cases of small possession, which limits the degree to which law enforcement can make arrests, though sale and distribution of psychedelic substances remains illegal. There is variation in how low -level po ssession is defined from state to state, from 4 grams of psilocybin in Missouri to 28 grams in New Jersey to 1.5 ounces in Oklahoma. Reclassification involves a change in regulatory or statutory language to recategorize a drug within the state, effectively removing it from the state's schedule 1 drug categorization. Hawaii and New York have bills introducing this strategy. As stated above, interactions with federal law are complex\u2014but, in this case as with all others, the drug would remain illegal on a fed eral level even if reclassified at a state level. Lastly, broad decriminalization efforts, separate from existing PAT legislation, are being pursued in a handful of states. Maine and Oregon have bills that propose to decriminalize illegal drug possession, and Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 70 Washington's recent state supreme court decision paves the way for legislators to decriminalize illegal drug possession. Though federal restrictions still apply, these last two approaches have implications for the viability of psychedelic drug facilit ation, production, training, and testing centers in each state. Funding Approach Funding for psychedelic therapy in many cases has not been thoroughly addressed, as much of the existing PAT legislation has years before implementation. Despite this, fundin g sources are important to consider in the case of legislative success. In instances where funding is included, bills or ballot initiatives designate funding from the state DoH or establish a fund for the implementation of PAT. The legislation with funding plans is mentioned below: Connecticut and Maryland have established funds with allocations of $1.5 million and $1 million respectively Texas and Hawaii are to receive funds directly from the state DoH Oklahoma and Missouri will use outside research insti tutions for research and funding Georgia's funding will be allocated from the House of Representatives' budget Decriminalization bills such as Virginia and New Hampshire take funds earned from illegal drug possession fees and put them towards addiction treatment services in the state Bill Model and Goal The categories above break down the functions of existing psychedelic drug bills and ballot initiatives. Building on these categories and functions, it is possible to identify model definitions that describe the goal being pursued in a bill or ballot initiative. The definitions below are flexible and broad as each state bill or ballot initiative varies greatly from the next. What the model definitions below aim to achieve is a shared terminology to better describe the range of options being pursued at the state level. Medical Model \u2014The individual seeking therapy m ust have a diagnosis from a doctor that is included in the specific diagnoses eligible for treatment by the state for PAT. o Under this model, a state agency such as the Department of Health may be involved in oversight. o Facilitators for psychedelic therapy may include those with clinical training or state licenses. Wellbeing Model\u2014Available to all above the age requirement, psychedelic therapy facilitators are not necessarily clinical profess ionals, and no diagnosis or doctor's rec ommendation is needed . o Without a direct connection to a medical diagnosis, reimbursement by health insurance seems unlikely. Possess & Share Model \u2014Low level possession is legal at state level, individuals are allowed to cultivate, possess, and use certain psychedelics, as long as there is no sale of the drug and possession stays below state -set legal limits . o This plan likely involves little to no govern ment regulation. o Possession limits vary. Research Model \u2014Psychedelics are only used in a research setting; research institutions may cultivate and administer psychedelics to certain populations for research purposes with goal of developing a recommendation for a facilitated PAT model in the state . o Not all states allow for cultivation in -state. Washington Psilocybin Stakeholder Workgroup December 1, 2022 Page | 71 o Research on the efficacy of treating select diagnoses or conditions is encouraged. Prescription Model \u2014Psychedelics are available to obtain by prescription for use out side a licensed facility . Decriminalization Model \u2014Bill does not propose any research or facilitation plan, but removes penalties on certain levels of psychedelic drug possession, or decriminalizes or reclassifies the drug(s) within the state. o Revenue from fines levied for low level possession are often directed towards research or addiction treatment programs. Advisory Board Recommendation Model \u2014The state will consider future legislation or form an implementation plan based on the recommendations of an advisory board . o In some cases, the advisory board is given directives by bill language to implement or recommend a certain mode l, often a Medical Model. o In other cases, the advisory board is given less dire ction and more say in the scope of recommendations. Conclusion The pace of psychedelic drug legislation is rapidly increasing. Within the last two years, 19 pieces of legislation have been introduced attempting to decriminalize, research, or facilitate the use of psychedelics. The bills and ballot measures introduced contain a remarkable degree of variation, indicating that there are still opportunities for states to exchange lessons learned on program design. The identified models \u2014Medical, Wellbeing, Possess & Share, Research, Prescription, Decriminalization , Advisory Board Recommendation \u2014give policymakers options to consider, along with a sense of the proposed landscape of activity. This analysis is intended to compile those options and create a shared language to define them as models. PAT faces legitimate barriers to success, foremost of which being therapeutic psychedelics' classification as a federal schedule 1 drug. Federal illegality presents legitimate challenges to facilitative therapy, legal production, and insurance coverage, am ong other challenges. Systematic inequalities, when placed alongside the potential cost of a facilitation session, pose a serious challenge to affordable and accessible access to psychedelic therapy. Future legislation, advisory board recommendations, and other forms of governmental action relating to PAT should scrutinize the facilitative models currently being passed in states to ensure equitable access to care. By continuing to support research related to PAT, and sharing research findings and implement ation strategies, state policy makers can slowly begin to form consensus on harm reduction strategies, training, evidence for treatment, and supportive facilitation models. Through collaborative policy development, PAT has a chance to be implemented in a m anner to ensure safety and equitable access for individuals.
