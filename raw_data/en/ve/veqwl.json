Featuring a patent pending extract, the formulations have been clinically proven to increase hydration levels and prevent transepidermal water loss for up to 24 hrs, helping maintain a healthy skin barrier. Why prickly pear cactus? Despite its dry looking exterior, this desert plant is bursting with moisture, enabling it to thrive and blossom in the driest of climates, withstanding increasing temperatures and decreasing water supplies. Prickly pear cactus stores water in its broad, paddle-shaped lobes called cladodes. The juicy, moisture rich mucilage inside allows the plant to maintain its balance even in an extreme climate. This mucilage is like a plant version of our skin's natural hyaluronic acid reserves, containing polysaccharides (sugars) that attract and retain moisture. Our 100% natural extract of organic prickly pear cactus is sustainably sourced to UEBT (Union for Ethical Bio Trade) standards from Jalisco in Mexico.

Weleda's fragrance philosophy: Prickly pear cactus We have been creating 100% natural and authentic fragrances for over 100 years. Great consideration is given when creating specific fragrances for each of our products because natural scents from essential oils not only have physical effects but, depending on the amount used, can have biochemical and psychological effects too: the body's olfactory receptors aren't just found in the nose but in the skin as well. For the Prickly Pear Cactus range, our in-house perfumers developed a subtle fragrance combining essential oils of green mandarin, palmarosa and peppermint to give an uplifting and refreshing experience to boost mood and benefit the skin.
