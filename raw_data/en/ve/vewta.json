She said to me, \"The Lord has given you the ability to reveal the hidden things.\" I tucked this away for a time. THE MOUTH When I first began learning to hear the Lord, one thing He kept repeating was this, \"I want to use your mouth.\" Not being a very talkative person, I wondered how this would take place. I couldn't deny that I kept hearing about the 'mouth.' What in the world does that have to do with the word PALA? Allow me to share. 2007 - GEORGIA In 2007, in the week of the Jewish High Holy days, while on a short retreat in the mountains of Georgia, in the early morning, I heard the Lord speak to my spirit saying, \"Daughter, ... Go therefore and make disciples and teach them to obey all I have commanded including delivering the oppressed. You will do wonders beyond your imagination not by your might but by My Spirit and My Power.\" [For reference - the scripture says in Zechariah 4.6 ...Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of hosts. The scripture says ' nor by power' - in my quote above is says by His power - did I hear incorrectly? No. He will do the work through 'His Holy Spirit,' described also as dunamis (dynamite power) and 'His Power', not mine.] When asking the Lord to help recall what else was said so I could record it well, I then heard... \"You will deliver the captives.\" What else should I do for you Lord? \"Go and set the captives free.\" Part of what this means for me is the setting free of their souls, not just for eternity but for here and now. Being captive is like being in prison, in torment. The 'setting of captives free' is the releasing of the prisoners from the torment of also what's going on inside. Inside the Soul (the mind, will and emotions.) 2014 - INDIANA - 7 YEARS LATER In 2014, 7 years after the \"Go and set the captives free\" word, a woman whom I had just met in Indiana, spoke to me what she believed was a word from the Lord. I've had other words spoken to me, however this word, even though I didn't know how it could come to be, her words struck me. I knew it was true. She said, \"I hear the Lord saying, that you are quiet but you are mighty. And the intercession, the groans through you, moves heaven. And the angels, the war angels hear you very well... You have a heart that is very pure. You are pure to your family and your husband and you are a woman of God... Go on forward. You're going to be leading an army... I see women and children. Here you are on the front lines... I do see you as the woman in God, that God is speaking to you that there is a mighty warrior spirit in you. I see a Deborah spirit. And that's what God is saying to you today Paula. \" Wow! 2015 - TENNESSEE, 8 YEARS LATER While on a short get-away to Tennessee in 2015, on a cold and snowy winter morning, nestled in a cabin while my husband and his mother went out to capture a sunrise photo, I recalled what a client had said. She said to me, \"The Lord has given you the ability to reveal the hidden things.\" Recalling her words and honing in on the word 'hidden.' This is what I was thinking about that morning. The bible search began on the word, 'hidden,' and when I came across Psalm 139 the hebrew 'pala' jumped out at me. Tears began rolling down my face in awe. You see, up until that morning, I had always thought that my name 'Paula' meant, 'little.' And the feminine of 'Paul.' I discovered it meant so much more. PALA MEANING 'Pala' literally told the meaning of my calling and what I had been doing for others in prayer and ministering to their souls for freedom, healing, miracles, and breakthrough. Now I understood that my name fit what I've been called to do and the anointing to do it despite my shortcomings. In His grace, He is still perfecting me, thank goodness. Pala Meaning - Going before the King, in interceding prayer, discerning, righteously judging, with His authority, like a shepherd, removing the debris, the hinderances to healing, and freedom. A gentle yet powerful exposing of the hidden works of the enemy and his lies, a key to bringing it into light in a safe manner and space; to pave the way for the Lord's Truth and miraculous, wonderous works through His Spirit and His Power. Wowee!! WONDERS Tune into the word 'WONDERS' for a moment. It's also connected to Wonderous, Wonderfully, Extraordinary, Marvelous, Miraculous. Psalm 139:13-16 [You Have Searched Me and Known Me](https://biblehub.com/bsb/psalms/139.htm) 13 For You formed my inmost being; You knit me together in my My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in secret, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.... Woe!! THE HEBREW LETTERS The hebrew letters are fascinating. Each with a picture, sound, number value and meaning. One of the root meanings of Palal is 'to pray'. Some years ago, we visited a church we'd never been to before. Afterwards we received prayer and a person there said to me, \"You're an intercessor.\" I didn't know what that meant exactly. Now I know it has to do with prayer. Interceding on behalf of another. What does that have to do with hebrew letters and the Pala thing? The Hebrew letter 'Pey' - ' ' for 'P' is a picture of? A mouth! To represent speaking. The 'Lamed' - ' ' for 'L' is a picture of a staff. A symbol of authority. Pal means 'to fall, kneel' Put it all together. 'To fall to the ground in prayer, speaking to authority to plead a case of another.\" Add the letter 'Aleph' - '' for 'A' is a picture of an ox. A symbol of strength. The way the letter is written also represents Jesus, the Messiah as our intercessor. God coming down to man to intercede for us. [https://hebrew4rchristians.com](https://hebrew4rchristians.com) Adding the letter 'A' to P-L brings the meaning to 'perform, intercession' and altogether it translates into 'to perform a great work (as an act of intercession), wonder, marvellous, extraordinary.' Yes, I'm totally amazed! [https://www.ancient-hebrew.org/vocabulary/ancient-hebrew-words-for-prayer.htm](https://www.ancient-hebrew.org/vocabulary/ancient-hebrew-words-for-prayer.htm) 2021 - PRAYER ANSWERED, 14 YEARS LATER 14 Years later to the month, during the weeklong Jewish Holiday Sukkot (09/2021), Boom! The PALA PROTOCOL is official. Summer 2023 - Name Updated For Clarity to PALA HEALING PROTOCOL (Unplanned by me but I think not a coincidence. Sukkot is also known as the Feast of Booths or the Feast of Tabernacles. As Christians we relate this as the Lord coming to tabernacle, dwell with us.) This Pala Protocol is an answer to years of prayer; dissatisfaction with the slowness of healing. When there wasn't an instant miracle or when the miracle didn't remain, I sought to discover the reason, the why. I kept saying, \"Lord, there must be a better way. There's got to be a better way.\" Meaning, if a miracle wasn't going to happen right now, how could healing come, a gradual miracle? What was preventing it from happening and remaining? And how could I humbly, yet boldy, assist others, not with 'years' of prayer or coaching, or counseling or therapy, but with only hours or 'months, less than a year. How could years of trauma heal in a relatively short time? THE LAUNCH I believe the Pala Healing Protocol launch is part of the 2007 and the 2014 words. Pala Healing is what ministers to me the most. As it turns out, it also ministers to most of you too! More and more of you are learning the Pala Healing Protocol for yourselves and taking it to your children, family, friends, clients and ministry. The 1st Students Without advertising, within 2 weeks of each other, the Lord sends two women of God to become the 1st 2 students. In the 1st 90 days, the 3rd Student! The next Student was the Head of an International Ministry. She has a taught her Teachers (who minister to others) and she has brought other Heads of Ministries to Abundant Life Coaches for help in healing and growing. GOD IS SO GOOD!!! I feel so honored. This is after years of wondering when this would happen. It's Coming to Pass This is 'the leading of women and children' into freedom, healing, and wholeness. Setting them free from the prison of hurts and lies of the enemy, bringing them into the Truth of who God says they are and doing what He says they can do. In 2022 and 2023, The Lord has opened doors to minister to ministers, even to the Heads of Ministries. That's been on my heart to do for a long while. HE made it happen. These Ministers in-turn minister to many. Be Blessed! Now, go and live an Abundant Life!
