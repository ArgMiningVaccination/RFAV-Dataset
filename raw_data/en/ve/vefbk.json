The mRVNA vaccine has proven therapeutic efficacy in various applications, including infectious disease, immunotherapy, genetic disorders, regenerative medicine, and cancer. Many mRNA vaccines have made it to clinical trials, and a couple have obtained FDA approval. This emerging therapeutic approach has several advantages over conventional methods: safety; efficacy; adaptability; bulk production; and cost-effectiveness. However, it is worth mentioning that the delivery to the target site and in vivo degradation and thermal stability are boundaries that can alter their efficacy and outcomes. In this review, we shed light on different types of mRNA vaccines, their mode of action, and the process to optimize their development and overcome their limitations. We also have explored various delivery systems focusing on the nanoparticle-mediated delivery of the mRNA vaccine. Generally, the delivery system plays a vital role in enhancing mRNA vaccine stability, biocompatibility, and homing to the desired cells and tissues. In addition to their function as a delivery vehicle, they serve as a compartment that shields and protects the mRNA molecules against physical, chemical, and biological activities that can alter their efficiency.

Introduction [1](#B1-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Traditional utilize inactivated or attenuated pathogens, protein subunits, or viral vectors, which have played a significant role in the disease prevention [ [2](#B2-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. However, these conventional vaccine platforms often require complex manufacturing processes and may have limitations in terms of scalability, speed of development, and adaptability to emerging pathogens [ [3](#B3-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [4](#B4-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [6](#B6-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The mRNA vaccines represent a new class of vaccines that harness the body's cellular machinery to produce specific antigens, which will trigger the immune responses against the produced antigens [ [7](#B7-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. This innovative approach offers numerous advantages over traditional vaccine platforms. It has garnered significant attention, especially in the context of recent successes, such as the development and deployment of mRNA-based vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus [ [8](#B8-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [9](#B9-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [10](#B10-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. One of the key advantages of mRNA vaccines is their rapid development and production capabilities. Unlike traditional vaccines, which often require time-consuming and costly manufacturing processes, mRNA vaccines can be designed and synthesized in weeks, offering unprecedented flexibility and speed in response to emerging infectious diseases or evolving variants [ [11](#B11-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Additionally, the modular nature of mRNA vaccines enables easy adaptation to different pathogens by simply altering the mRNA sequence encoding the desired antigen [ [12](#B12-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [13](#B13-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [14](#B14-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. However, the efficient delivery of mRNA molecules into target cells poses a significant challenge, as they are susceptible to degradation, have limited stability, and face barriers in reaching the desired sites of action [ [15](#B15-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [16](#B16-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [17](#B17-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [18](#B18-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. These nanoscale carriers provide protective and delivery capabilities, facilitating efficient cellular uptake, protection from enzymatic degradation, and controlled release of mRNA payloads. Additionally, nanoparticles can be engineered to improve stability, prolong circulation time and facilitate their targeted delivery to immune cells or specific tissues, ultimately leading to enhanced immunogenicity and efficacy of mRNA vaccines [ [19](#B19-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [20](#B20-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [21](#B21-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [22](#B22-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. This approach has been successfully utilized in developing mRNA-based vaccines against various infectious diseases, including COVID-19 [ [6](#B6-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [23](#B23-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. LNPs have shown excellent safety profiles, high transfection efficiency, and the ability to induce robust immune responses, positioning them as promising tools for effective vaccination strategies. [24](#B24-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. At the same time, self-assembling peptides and protamine nanocomplexes offer unique design and manufacture mRNA vaccines using nanoparticles has demonstrated its potential for agility in responding to emerging infectious diseases, making it a valuable asset in the pandemic preparedness [ [33](#B33-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 2. Development of mRNA Vaccines 2.1. Types of mRNA Vaccines [34](#B34-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. For example, a DNA vaccine can be ideal because it can stimulate both the humoral and cellular immunities [ [34](#B34-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Furthermore, the large-scale manufacturing of genetic vaccines might be more tolerated than traditional vaccines [ [35](#B35-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. There are three types of mRNA the untranslated regions (5UTR, 3UTR) and the coding region of mRNA that can be transcribed to one copy of immunogenic protein; therefore, it is called the non-amplifying or non-replicating mRNA [ [35](#B35-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The immune response is directly proportional to the number of transcribed mRNAs, which may require a high dose of mRNA due to its unamplified behavior that could cause repeated administration of mRNA [ [35](#B35-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The self-amplifying mRNA vaccine is a genetically modified mRNA by adding engineered replicons originating from the self-replicating RNA [ [36](#B36-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [37](#B37-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Both self-amplifying mRNA and mRNA 3 conserved sequence elements (CSE) [ [35](#B35-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. It is hypothesized that CSEs can regulate viral RNA synthesis in addition to their ability to attach to viral or cellular proteins [ [38](#B38-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The main difference between self-amplifying mRNA and trans-amplifying 1-4) sequence, whereas trans-amplifying mRNA requires two genes to be co-delivered, the without nsP 1-4 and the mRNA that encodes nsP1-4 genes [ [39](#B39-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 2.2. Mechanism of Action of mRNA Vaccines [40](#B40-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Initially, the mRNA is transcribed from genomic DNA as a primary mRNA with the aid of RNA polymerase. The primary mRNA contains exon and intron. Thereafter, further modification of the primary mRNA occurs to be converted to mature mRNA, such as splicing of primary mRNA to remove the non-coding introns, capping the 5UTR, and poly-A sequence addition at the 3 terminal [ [41](#B41-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [42](#B42-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. From the mechanism of action of the mRNA translation, it is important to note that the contents of the synthesized mRNA vaccine that contains 5 cap, 5UTR, translated region, 3UTR, and poly-A tail to be recognized by the ribosome for successful translation of mRNA to the required antigen [ [43](#B43-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [44](#B44-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Several physiological barriers hinder the delivery of the synthesized RNA. One of the main barriers preventing RNA delivery is crossing the cell membrane and escaping from the endosomes [ [45](#B45-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Therefore, mRNA requires a delivery carrier which will be explained in detail in the next section ( [Section 3](#sec3-pharmaceutics-15-01972)). In the conventional mRNA, the open reading frames (ORFs) encode the antigen that can be translated to the antigen of interest, such as a virus epitope, which causes an immunogenic reaction that will lead to the recognition of the actual pathogen when the vaccinated subject gets infected with it [ [40](#B40-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-15-01972-f001)illustrates the mechanism of immune system activation in response to mRNA administration. [35](#B35-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The nsP1 is required for 5 capping of the viral RNA, and nsP2 can unwind the RNA duplex during replication in addition to the helicase and protease activity [ [46](#B46-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Furthermore, nsP2 [46](#B46-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The nsP3 facilitates the interaction between viral and host proteins [ [47](#B47-pharmaceutics-15-01972)], while nsP4 is an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) that catalyzes the replication of RNA [ [39](#B39-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. After the self-replication of the self-amplifying mRNA into several copies, these copies will be translated into antigens that will cause a more immunogenic response than the conventional mRNA [ [48](#B48-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [49](#B49-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 2.3. Optimizing mRNA Vaccines [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Even though the 5 and 3 UTRs do not have translated sequences during the translation process of mRNA, they can play a vital role in improving the stability of mRNA and protein expression from the mRNA [ [50](#B50-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [51](#B51-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Both the 5 cap in the 5UTR and the poly(A) end in the 3UTR of the mRNA can regulate the translational efficiency of the mRNA [ [52](#B52-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. For instance, it was reported that anti-reverse cap analogs were modified in the 5UTR, which will enhance the translation of mRNA in comparison to the unmodified mRNA. This translation enhancement might be caused by increasing the binding affinity of the modified cap to eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) in the ribosomes [ [53](#B53-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Additionally, it was shown that changing the mRNA cap into phosphorothioate may improve the stability and the expression of the mRNA vaccine when it is transfected in immature dendritic cells [ [54](#B54-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Adding nucleotides to the mRNA can alter the stability and translation capacity. It was reported that inserting pseudouridine into the mRNA in mammalian cells increased the yield of the translated protein and decreased the unwanted immunogenic reaction compared to the unmodified mRNA. This could enhance both safety and efficacy by decreasing the immunogenic reaction and increasing the expression of the protein, respectively [ [55](#B55-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that incorporating the modified nucleosides into the mRNA could reduce or eliminate the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activation, which would enhance the safety of the mRNA vaccine by modification of its nucleosides [ [7](#B7-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 3. The mRNA Vaccine Delivery Systems 3.1. Polymeric Nanoparticles [56](#B56-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. However, its use was limited due to its high surface charge density and toxicity profile. Researchers have explored alternative methods, such as adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the low molecular weight PEI and binding it to the cyclodextrin [ [57](#B57-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The conjugation with cyclodextrin was demonstrated to be an effective and safer approach for mRNA delivery, and it can be administered through different routes, which may lead to the production of distinct antibodies. New biodegradable polymers, such as poly(amino esters), have exhibited a promising future for delivering mRNA to the lungs [ [58](#B58-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Scientists have developed poly(-amino esters) libraries for structure-function studies, which can be produced using the Michael reaction [ [59](#B59-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. These biodegradable polymers can easily modify the backbone and peripheral groups [ [60](#B60-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Hyper-branched dendritic spherical dendrimers with high amine density efficiently form mRNA complexes. However, their excessive charge densities harmed cells and caused serum clumping, but these challenges could be tackled by adding PEG to their cores or disulfide linkages [ [61](#B61-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [25](#B25-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Amphipathic polymers amine also carry mRNA into the cells by electrostatically binding to the mRNA, creating nano-complexes. Generally, high molecular weight polymers, such as chitosan and PEI, need modification to improve the transfection efficacy and durability [ [62](#B62-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. At the same time, the mRNA affinity can be influenced by the polymer's length, charge density, and mixture concentration [ [63](#B63-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [64](#B64-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [66](#B66-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 3.2. The protein nanoparticles typically have 20 to 200 nm dimensions, ideal for effective lymph node targeting. A reliable and secure method of administering vaccines is using self-assembled protein carriers in vaccine delivery systems. For instance, Wang et al. have reported that a hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination with both therapeutic and preventative properties was achieved by the conjugation of Pre-S1 HBV and transport mRNA to dendritic cells [ [25](#B25-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. A recent study of amphipathic CPP/mRNA complexes, with a size of less than 200 nm, has shown a significant cellular uptake and protein expression in mice colon cancer cells [ [61](#B61-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 3.3. Protamine Nanoparticles [27](#B27-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. This net positive charge makes protamine able to complex nucleic acids, such as RNAs, to improve the stability of biological systems by protecting them from enzymatic degradation by nuclease and enhancing their delivery to targeted tissue [ [72](#B72-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Due to the versatile features and clinical safety of protamine compound, it has multiple applications in biomedical research as a drug delivery nanocarrier [ [73](#B73-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The most important feature of the protamine delivery system is the cationic properties due to an arginine-rich sequence, which enhances the complexation of protamine with any negatively charged molecules, such as mRNA, which can be exploited in the designing of mRNA-based vaccines [ [28](#B28-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [74](#B74-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [75](#B75-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The studies showed that protecting the mRNA with protamine resulted in a significant decrease in the tumor's growth and eventual disappearance, as well as a memory antitumor immune response developing after intra-tumoral injection of the stabilized mRNA. Furthermore, protamine was used with CureVac's self-adjuvanted RNActive\u00ae delivery technology to complex mRNA, which led to the development of rabies and influenza A vaccines [ [76](#B76-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [77](#B77-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. It should be noted that protamine has been used to improve the transfection efficiency of complexed nucleic acid with no detectable cytotoxicity of concentration up to 10 mM in comparison to other commonly used transfection reagents (i.e., Polyethylenimine (PEI) polymer) which reported to induce in vitro toxic effect at dose above 5 mM [ [27](#B27-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Recently, the exploitation of protamine in the delivery of mRNA has been increased to prepare well-established vaccines, and more research is expected. 3.4. Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) [78](#B78-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The LNPs have been employed in developing SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines that have received clinical approval. For mRNA administration, LNPs provide substantial advantages, such as simplicity of formulation, modularity, biocompatibility, and high mRNA payload capacity. The LNPs typically consist of three main components: an ionizable lipid (40-50%); cholesterol (38-45%); and a helper phospholipid (10-12%); in some cases, a fourth component is added, such as PEGylated lipid (1-2%) [ [79](#B79-pharmaceutics-15-01972)], as illustrated in [Figure 2](#pharmaceutics-15-01972-f002). These components function together to enclose and safeguard the naked mRNA [ [48](#B48-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The first lipids that carried an RNA were the cationic DOTMA (1,2-Di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium propane) and their synthetic equivalent DOTAP (1,2-Dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane) in 1989 [ [80](#B80-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Since then, numerous additional cationic lipids, such as the widely used Lipofectamine, have been employed for RNA delivery [ [81](#B81-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [82](#B82-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [83](#B83-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. When ionizable lipids are introduced into the bloodstream at physiological pH levels, they have a neutral charge, which enhances their safety and extends their circulation time compared to other lipids [ [18](#B18-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. These ionizable lipids are combined with mRNA in an acidic solution, forming nanoparticles in which the positively charged lipids attract the RNA. Moreover, due to the acidic environment of the endosomes, they readily fuse with the endosomal membrane, releasing the mRNA into the cytoplasm [ [84](#B84-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The first ionizable lipids for (1,2-Dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium-propane) and (1,2-Dioleyloxy-3-dimethylaminopropane) [ [85](#B85-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Another ionizable lipid used for mRNA delivery is DLin-MC3-DMA owing to its high efficacy and safety profiles siRNA [ [86](#B86-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [87](#B87-pharmaceutics-15-01972), LNPs involves dissolving mRNA in a low pH aqueous buffer (pH~4.0) and microfluidically mixing it with an ethanolic solution of hydrophobic lipids to form stable LNPs with low polydispersity index. These LNPs initially contain 25-50% ethanol and have a low pH; thus, they require further dialysis and buffer exchange using tangential flow filtration (TFF) to obtain the final bulk product [ [18](#B18-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [78](#B78-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. This product can be sterilized by filtering through a 0.2 m sterile grade filter and then filled into aseptic containers. The finished drug product can be in either a lyophilized or direct fill-finish format [ [92](#B92-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 4. The mRNA Vaccine Applications 4.1. The mRNA Vaccines against Infectious Diseases [93](#B93-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The mRNA vaccine encodes the antigen of the spike protein or the spike protein's receptor-binding domain, therefore protecting the infected subject from this life-threatening infection. In late 2020, the FDA approved the first two mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2) and the Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273). Both vaccines were formulated as LNPs encapsulating the mRNA using ionizable lipids. Two doses of BNT162b2 proved to be 87% effective at preventing hospitalizations, 94% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, and 95% overall effective at preventing COVID-19 [ [9](#B9-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [94](#B94-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Primary and booster injections of both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 were reported to be 90% effective against SARS-CoV-2 [ [95](#B95-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. It should be noted that the Moderna vaccine showed good safety and effectiveness following its storage for a month at 4-8 \u00b0C, while the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine needs 60 \u00b0C storage conditions. Several more mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases, such as influenza, Zika, Cytomegalovirus, and rabies, are being developed [ [96](#B96-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. A recent study developed an LNP-based vaccine from the 20 lineages of influenza A and B viruses encoding hemagglutinin antigens to protect against homologous and heterologous variable viruses [ [97](#B97-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 4.2. The mRNA Vaccines against Cancers [98](#B98-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The FixVac BNT111 vaccine, which BioNTech is developing, is one example of an mRNA cancer vaccine that targets four melanoma TAAs, including tyrosinase, antigen family A3 phosphatase with tensin (TPTE) [ [99](#B99-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. According to a preclinical study, BNT111 was shown to induce a potent antitumor immune response in a phase 1/2 trial, where 75% of the patients exhibited immune responses against at least one of the four TAAs following a series of eight injections, and CD8+ T cells were essential in the T-cell responses. Additional examples of mRNA vaccines include the BNT112 and BNT113 (i.e., individualized vaccines) that are tailored to the specific mutations presented in an individual patient's tumor and encode five prostate cancer-specific antigens (PAP, PSA, and three undisclosed (HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins), respectively. Moreover, a BNT122 is a combination vaccine that is designed to encode individual tumor mutations and a personalized set of pre-manufactured non-mutated shared tumor-associated antigens (BNT114), which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in treating various types of cancer [ [100](#B100-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [101](#B101-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The different vaccine candidates target multiple types of cancer, such as melanoma, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc. 5. Clinical Trials of mRNA Vaccines [102](#B102-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. However, the field of mRNA vaccine remains mainly focused on infectious diseases, with around 70% among all ongoing mRNA vaccine trials. The number of mRNA vaccine-based clinical trials have been raised significantly in recent years following the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of the mRNA vaccine. The recent FDA approval of two rapid-response mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 is a remarkable achievement that facilitated the entry of more mRNA-based vaccines into clinical trials to be used for different medical applications [ [100](#B100-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases are commonly administrated as a bolus injection, where they are translated into antigens after being taken up by immune and non-immune cells. In the clinical trials, many mRNA vaccine candidates have been submitted and investigated against infectious diseases and cancers, and the most popular examples are summarized in [Table 1](#pharmaceutics-15-01972-t001). [103](#B103-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. It has been demonstrated that immunization against an antigen (i.e., prM-E protein) from any Zika virus strains could protect against all infections caused by the Zika virus since the disease is caused by a single serotype [ [104](#B104-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Encapsulating modified mRNA encoding Zika virus structural genes into lipid-based nanocarriers is a versatile platform to produce mRNA-based Zika vaccine [ [105](#B105-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The administration of prime-boost vaccine of modified mRNA encoding Zika prM-E genes that generated virus-like particles led to an increase in the levels of Zika virus neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that protect Hence, the administrated mRNA Zika vaccine-induced protective antibody responses against the Zika virus [ [106](#B106-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. It has been reported that a dose of 30 \u00b5g or 50 \u00b5g mRNA vaccine composed of LNPs loaded with prM-E mRNA generated neutralizing antibodies, which is 50-100 times higher than those induced by the conventional way of the inactivated virus [ [21](#B21-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Exploiting the mRNA platform as a Zika vaccine candidate showed potent neutralizing antibody responses to the Zika virus, providing a proof of concept for rapid protection against this infection [ [107](#B107-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Despite the effectiveness of this vaccine, it is poorly designed, in which it suffers from the activation of dengue viral infection via the production of cross-reactive antibodies [ [108](#B108-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The new Zika virus vaccine in a clinical trial has been developed by Moderna via the insertion of a mutated fusion loop epitope in the E protein into the modified prM-E mRNA (mRNA-1893). The result of mice immunization using this mRNA-based vaccine exhibited protection against the Zika virus with no production of dengue-enhancing antibodies [ [106](#B106-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [109](#B109-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [110](#B110-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. A new vaccine candidate (mRNA-1345) that encodes the perfusion F protein has been evaluated by Moderna to vaccinate children against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [ [111](#B111-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. This product has been formulated as LNPs and is currently between phases 2 and 3 of clinical trials [ [112](#B112-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [113](#B113-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Despite the good properties of this vaccine candidate, the clinical trial study showed that the effectiveness of CVnCoV against COVID-19 is around 47% only. Arcturus Therapeutics Company produced a self-amplifying mRNA (ARCT-021), which encodes the full-length perfusion spike protein. A single dose of this vaccine candidate significantly protected injected mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection by elevating the IgG titers and high T cell response [ [114](#B114-pharmaceutics-15-01972)], resulting in full immunization following a single injection. [115](#B115-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [116](#B116-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Another personalized mRNA-based cancer vaccine is mRNA-4157, which contains up to 34 neo-antigens encoded in a single mRNA strand. This vaccine was developed by collaborative work between Moderna and Merck, and the mRNA was incorporated into a lipid-based delivery vehicle administrated via intramuscular injection (I.M.) [ [117](#B117-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The personalized mRNA-based cancer vaccine (mRNA-4157) in combination with monoclonal antibodies chemotherapy pembrolizumab (Keytruda) enhanced recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared with pembrolizumab alone when used as an adjuvant treatment in patients with resected high-risk melanoma [ [118](#B118-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [115](#B115-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Repeated doses of the BNT111 vaccine exhibited induction of immune response against the increased [ [115](#B115-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Furthermore, CV9202 is a vaccine candidate developed by CureVac composed of six different species of mRNA that encode six different antigens to target the non-small cell lung cancer [ 1](#pharmaceutics-15-01972-t001), four products BNT311/GEN1046, BNT312/GEN1042, investigated for efficient immunotherapy against cancers. BNT141 product developed by BioNTech reported being effective against different types of cancer, such as non-small-cell lung cancer, gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, metastatic gastric cancer, gallbladder cancer, biliary tract cancer, colorectal cancer, and mucinous ovarian cancers, through targeting cells expressing CLDN18.2 [ [120](#B120-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The BNT311/GEN1046 and BNT312/GEN1042 are mRNA and bispecific antibody CD40 \u00d7 4-1BB, respectively. It was reported that they could stimulate the proliferation of T cells, secretion of cytokines, and antitumor activity. These two immunotherapy candidates demonstrated pharmacodynamic immune effects in the peripheral blood following their administration, suggesting the ability to be used to treat patients suffering from advanced refractory solid tumors [ [121](#B121-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [122](#B122-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The BNT211 is another immunotherapy candidate produced by BioNTech and can act by targeting the tumor-specific antigen Claudin-6 (CLDN6). The administration of this vaccine exhibited a high disease control rate of 86% and an overall response rate of 43% could be promoted due to the antibodies produced against the components of mRNA delivery nanocarriers used or the mRNA molecule itself that could facilitate severe immune response [ [133](#B133-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Hence, the optimization of nanocarriers' compositions and performing mRNA molecular modifications are crucial steps to avoid or minimize adverse reactions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that people with a history of allergic reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines should avoid the administration of other mRNA-based vaccines [ [96](#B96-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 6. Future Applications of mRNA Vaccines 6.1. Future Consideration in mRNA Vaccines Development 6.1.1. Utilizing Different Types of mRNA [35](#B35-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Self-amplification mRNAs are more significant than traditional mRNAs due to incorporating additional replicon genes, and nucleoside modification cannot accommodate these modifications [ [35](#B35-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Several candidates are currently being evaluated in clinical trials [ [134](#B134-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on self-amplifying mRNA have already been shown to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies in animals. These vaccines can be administered in smaller doses (from 1 to 10 gm) than established mRNAs (from 30 to 100 gm) of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [ [134](#B134-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [135](#B135-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Recent research has shown that the protein-coding function of certain circ.mRNAs holds great promise for application in the protein translation [ [136](#B136-pharmaceutics-15-01972)] due to the absence of the terminus motifs required for the degradation process by exonuclease, circ.mRNAs confer more excellent stability than linear mRNAs [ [137](#B137-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [138](#B138-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Circular RNAs induce fewer unwanted immune responses than unmodified linear mRNAs and a circ.mRNA vaccine causes a more significant amount of neutralizing antibodies compared to a linear mRNA vaccine [ [139](#B139-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Companies are investigating additional variants of circ.mRNAs, including optimized internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) [140](#B140-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 6.1.2. Ideal Delivery System for mRNA [141](#B141-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. EntosPharma company created a fusogenic vehicle platform proteo-lipid neutral lipids with low-toxicity and exclusive fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins to deliver mRNAs directly into the cytoplasm [ [142](#B142-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. A redox-responsive coacervate and pH produced from a phase-separating peptide has accomplished direct delivery of mRNAs in the cytosol to cells and redox-activated mRNA release [ [143](#B143-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Innovations are continuing for the production of LNPs with various purposes that are more potent [ [144](#B144-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Heterocyclic lipids, unsaturated lipids, and alkyne lipids can improve the efficacy of LNPs. At the same time, their structural modifications with thiol groups or bisphosphate groups can target mRNAs to the Janus has efficiently enabled the mRNAs delivery to various tissues, suggesting a potential de-complexification of the existing LNP four-constituent system [ [147](#B147-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [148](#B148-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [149](#B149-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Codiak BioSciences, for instance, to treat solid tumors, has commenced trials of existing therapy based on engineered exosomes in humans. Exosomal mRNA vaccines stimulated more potent IgG and secretive IgA in mice than LNP carriers [ [150](#B150-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Exosomes will be considered a promising mRNA delivery platform due to their lower immunogenicity and toxicity compared to the existing platforms. Thus, they are ideal for multiple mRNA dosing in clinical trials. [150](#B150-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Organ-selectively targeting nanoparticle (OSTN) platforms have been developed to deliver mRNAs selectively to mouse lungs, spleen, or liver [ [151](#B151-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The efficiency of mRNA delivery has been significantly increased by a new version of the OSTN platform containing an ionizable phospholipid membrane destabilizing. Alternative administration methods include delivery of mRNA nanoparticles intra-vesical to target bladder sites, orally via robotic pills to target digestive tract sites, and via inhaling to target lung sites [ [152](#B152-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The development of optimized formulations of LNPs or polymer nanoparticles is aimed at enabling the delivery of mRNA specifically to a particular cell type and using cell-specific ligands. In these delivery systems of organ- or cell-targeting mRNA, as more research is conducted, the range of diseases that can be treated with mRNA therapies will broaden [ [153](#B153-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 6.1.3. Route of Administration and Storage Considerations of mRNA [154](#B154-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Calcium and anionic phospholipids interact to form this lipid nanocrystal, allowing mRNA-inducing active drug molecules to be loaded into the layers [ [155](#B155-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [113](#B113-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Recently, CureVac has optimized the translation and immunogenicity of CV2. CoV, a second-generation candidate, compared to CVn.CoV. The in vitro study of CV2.CoV exhibited greater protein expression than CVn.CoV-induced high levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies in rats against the SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.1.298, and B.1.351) [ [156](#B156-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 6.2. Novel and Versatile Future Therapy of the mRNA Vaccines 6.2.1. The mRNA Vaccines for Infectious Diseases Prevention [154](#B154-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The mRNA vaccines have demonstrated remarkable efficacy and safety against COVID-19 and are being developed for other pathogens, including influenza, Zika, rabies, HIV, and tuberculosis. By delivering mRNA encoding specific antigens to the recipient's cells, which then produce the antigens and present them to the immune system, mRNA vaccines can induce protective immunity. They can also be designed to target multiple antigens or strains of a pathogen, which could enhance their efficacy and resistance to emerging variants and co-infections [ [43](#B43-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [155](#B155-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 6.2.2. The mRNA Vaccines for Cancer Therapy [154](#B154-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Tumor antigens are proteins expressed by tumor cells but not normal cells, which the immune system recognizes as foreign. Immune modulators, such as cytokines, checkpoint inhibitors, and costimulatory molecules, can stimulate or inhibit the immune response. Gene editing components include Cas9 (CRISPR), an targeted cell's genomes. The mRNA therapy can induce tumor cell death, activate immune cells, or modify tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes by delivering mRNA encoding of these molecules to tumor cells or immune cells [ [154](#B154-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 6.2.3. The mRNA Vaccines for Genetic Disorders Therapy [154](#B154-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the clotting factor-encoding genes. Any mutation in the gene that encodes cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance cystic fibrosis. Muscular dystrophy is a disease of the muscles caused by mutations in the dystrophin-encoding gene. By transporting mRNA encoding these proteins or genes to diseased cells or tissues, mRNA therapy can restore their normal function and alleviate disease symptoms [ [154](#B154-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 6.2.4. The mRNA Vaccines in Regenerative Medicine [154](#B154-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Pluripotency is a cell's capacity to differentiate into any body cell. A cell becoming specialized for a particular function is called differentiation. Reprogramming transforms a cell's identity from one type to another. The mRNA therapy can generate pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), differentiated cells (cardiomyocytes or neurons), or reprogrammed cells (induced PSCs or induced neurons) from somatic cells (fibroblasts or blood cells) by delivering mRNA encoding factors that can influence these processes, such as transcription factors, growth factors, or signaling molecules [ [154](#B154-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 6.3. Advantages and Acceptance Criteria of mRNA Vaccines [157](#B157-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]: Effectiveness of mRNA Vaccines 6.4.1. The mRNA Stability [158](#B158-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Improving the thermal stability of mRNA molecules and developing formulations that can withstand higher temperatures are crucial for future mRNA applications [ [159](#B159-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 6.4.2. The mRNA Delivery [158](#B158-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. LNPs may also cause adverse reactions, such as inflammation, allergic reactions, and immune responses [ [160](#B160-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 6.4.3. Accessibility and Acceptance [155](#B155-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. These requirements create technical and logistical obstacles to the mass production and distribution of mRNA therapy [ [155](#B155-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Some population segments may resist mRNA vaccines due to misinformation, mistrust, and ethical concerns. 6.4.4. Variability [161](#B161-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. This mutation may affect the properties of the virus, such as its transmission and the severity of illness [ [162](#B162-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Moreover, variants might contain mutations that modify the interactions with crucial host components [ [163](#B163-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Notably, selective pressure can result in mutations that allow variants to evade adaptive immune responses [ [164](#B164-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 6.4.5. Immunogenicity [165](#B165-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The mRNA vaccines can induce the innate immune system to regulate antigen-specific immune responses. However, there is a lack of information regarding practical vaccine measurements and descriptions of the duration of the protection provided by mRNA vaccines. Experience with other human coronaviruses indicates that reinfection is possible if the immune response is diminished, and there are still insufficient animal models that can accurately simulate human immune responses [ [166](#B166-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Researchers must continue to search for clinical evidence of the efficacy of mRNA vaccines in human trials [ [167](#B167-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. 6.4.6. Variation among the Populations [168](#B168-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Recent evidence from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, for instance, can spread primarily among young people, and those under 40 are more susceptible to infection [ [169](#B169-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. The mRNA-based antiviral vaccines have distinct advantages over conventional vaccines, but there is still debate regarding the effect of immunization on various populations [ [9](#B9-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [170](#B170-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Additional research must be conducted to comprehend the vaccination status of multiple individuals. Understanding the mechanisms underlying individual differences in the efficacy of mRNA vaccines will aid in advancing mRNA vaccines. 6.4.7. Adverse Reactions [171](#B171-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Some severe side effects may occur, leading to fear and anxiety among the population [ [172](#B172-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Theoretically, the mRNA vaccine is safer than other types of vaccines, as there is no infectious virus involved in its production, and there is a reduced risk of virulence reversion and insertional mutagenesis [ [173](#B173-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Due to the small number of participants, clinical trials may be inherently incapable of assessing the safety of vaccines, so comprehensive and long-term vaccine safety monitoring is required. By analyzing the data, not all immediate reactions to vaccinations are genuine allergic reactions [ [174](#B174-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Vaccine components, such as excipients, inactive ingredients, and liposomal delivery vehicles, are associated with allergic reactions [ [110](#B110-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Studies have shown that the incidence of adverse reactions is correlated with dosage, but whether dosage affects the occurrence of adverse reactions remains to be investigated [ [175](#B175-pharmaceutics-15-01972), [176](#B176-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. [177](#B177-pharmaceutics-15-01972)]. Evaluations of the safety profile of mRNA vaccines are currently limited by sample size, comparator group, follow-up time, age, gender, and racial/ethnic group of vaccinated individuals. Further investigation of the associations between vaccination and associated adverse events will result in a more thorough evaluation of the safety of mRNA vaccine candidates. Finally, it is crucial to continue public education and communication, which are necessary to increase awareness and confidence in mRNA vaccines' safety and efficacy, as they can potentially improve global health and save millions of lives. 7.
