Indulge in exquisite chef-prepared meals, with expansive menu options and international cuisines offered in many communities. Life-plan communities Sometimes called Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs), life plan communities provide different tiers of care services on one campus. This often includes independent and assisted living, memory care, and/or skilled nursing. This can be a popular choice for seniors who want to age in place and not worry about their care costs increasing or having to move due to illness or health decline. A large care service fee is typically charged upfront at life plan communities, with some seniors using proceeds from the sale of a home to cover the cost. This essentially guarantees a variety of care services are available to you within the campus, if and when such services are needed. "}
