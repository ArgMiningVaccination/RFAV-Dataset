The most familiarmeans to control hemorrhage are surgical liga-tures and clips. Other means includetranscatheter embolization, appropriate bloodcomponent therapy, maintenance of normo-thermia, and pharmacologic agents. Finally, attention must also be directed toward treat- ment of the hypercoaguable state that followsmajor traumatic injury and can lead to deepvenous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The management of massive transfusion and control of hemorrhage in the trauma pa-tient were discussed during two specialITACCS seminars. The 15 reports in thismonograph summarize the state-of-the art knowledge and clinical practice issues regard- ing surgical and nonsurgical management ofmassive transfusion and control of hemor-rhage in the injured patient. In the section on \"Etiology and Patho- physiology,\" Dr. Scalea reviews the physiologicimportance of recognizing and restoring he-mostasis following injury and discusses theAmerican College of Surgeons classificationscheme for hemorrhage, as well as operative and nonoperative (e.g., embolization) tech- niques for treatment of ongoing blood loss.Dr. Dutton discusses the four phases of trau-matic shock and reviews the macro- and mi-cro-circulatory responses to traumaticshock\u2014responses that ultimately determinepatient outcome. The \"Therapeutic Strategies\" section be- gins with a report on surgical perspectives to control bleeding in trauma. In that article, Dr. Plaisier describes the benefits and risks of topi-cal hemostatic agents such as oxidized cellu-lose, collagen hemostatic and effectsof a variety of drugs in trauma. There appearsto be a significant benefit of high-doseaprotinin therapy to reduce blood loss and the need for blood and blood product transfusion. Major post-traumatic morbidity and mortalitymay result from venous thromboembolism,and Dr. Stene discusses therapeutic strategiesto prevent and treat deep venous thrombosisand pulmonary embolism in the injured pa-tient. In the on atraumatic blood sal-vage and autotransfusion, Drs. Kevy andBrustowicz critique the use of surgical suction systems as a means of reducing (or supple- menting) allogeneic blood use. Dr. Smith ana-lyzes the use of fluid and blood componenttherapy in trauma and addresses various issuessuch as delayed fluid resuscitation, hypertonicfluids, endpoints of fluid and blood resuscita- tion, complications of transfusion therapy, and clinical strategies to reduce complications. The section on \"Transfusion: Clinical Prac- tice\" begins with a discussion on the immuno-logic consequences of transfusions and con-cludes that allogeneic transfusions have a dy-namic immunomodulatory effect on the recipi-ent and that leukocytes are the chief mediatorof these effects. Dr. Rosenberg reviews the sci-entific literature and his own personal experi- ence with the concept of \"decreasing the amount of blood transfused to trauma pa-tients\" in light of transfusion-related immuno-suppression and other risks. Dr. Sweeneyevaluates the options, risks, and potential com-plications of obtaining vascular access intrauma, illustrating the different approachesin pediatric and adult trauma patients. Theprinciples of warming IV fluid and blood are reviewed by Dr. Smith, with special emphasis on the thermal stress of infusing cold or inad-equately warmed fluids, and the safety and ef-ficacy of fluid warmers and rapid infusion de-vices. Dr. Desjardins focuses on the of exsanguinating hemorrhage (other-wise known as \"massive, massive transfusion\")and reports on the washing and centrifugingof packed red blood cells prior to rapid infu-sion in order to decrease adverse metabolic consequences such as hyperkalemia. Drs. Jernigan and D'Alessio discuss their experienceusing rapid infusion devices to deliver massivequantities of fluids, blood, and blood productsto maintain circulating blood volume. Theseauthors point out the controversies over hy-potensive versus normotensive resuscitation, the benefits of point-of-care testing, and theuse of guidelines (in conjunction with theblood bank) for managing trauma patients whorequire \"rapid infusion.\" In the final section on \"New Horizons in Synthetic Blood Substitutes,\" Dr. Mackenziereviews the complex issues surrounding theuse of hemoglobin solutions and hemorrhagic shock. He states that, although many of the problems associated with oxygen-carrying so-lutions have been overcome, there is a paucityof published data concerning the use of oxy-gen-carrying solutions in humans with hem-orrhagic shock. Dr. Schubert concludes themonograph by examining the potential clini-cal uses and effectiveness of hemoglobin-basedoxygen carriers and perfluorocarbons. The long shelf life, long circulation half-life, and good oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue oxy-gen delivery make these compounds particu-larly attractive in patients with high blood loss,i.e., trauma patients. In his manuscript, Dr.Schubert evaluates the different hemoglobinsolutions and the pitfalls associated with theirclinical use. As editors and principal organizers of this special ITACCS symposium, we have attempted to provide a concise, up-to-date reference onmassive transfusion and management of hem-orrhage in the trauma patient\u2014a reference thatintegrates both basic science and clinical prac-tice. We sincerely hope that you, the reader,will obtain essential knowledge from thismonograph that will improve your clinicalpractice when caring for trauma patients. Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patient Thomas M. Scalea, MD Physician-in-ChiefR Adams Cowley Shock Trauma CenterUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine22 South Greene StreetBaltimore, MD 21201 USA Acute blood loss is a very common prob- lem following injury. Rapid recognition andrestoration of homeostasis is the cornerstoneof the initial care of any badly injured patient.Untreated, hemorrhage robs the cardiovascu-lar system of the preload necessary to ensureadequate cardiac output and peripheral oxy-gen delivery. Inadequate perfusion, even if itis not associated with overt hypotension, can set off the neurohumoral cascade, ultimately leading to sequential organ failure. 1 This is especially important, as the mortality from es-SECTION I: Etiology and Pathophysiology Trauma, A Disease of Bleeding tablished organ failure has not changed sinceit was first described almost 25 years ago. 2 Thus, it is imperative that hemorrhage is rec- ognized and treated early. The recognition of acute hemorrhage can be difficult. The American College of Surgeonshas developed the classification scheme forhemorrhage, stratifying blood loss from Stage1 (less than 15% of total circulating blood vol-ume) to Stage 4 (more than 40% of total circu-lating blood volume). 3 Changes in various physiologic parameters as hemorrhage volume increases are listed in Table 1. Unfor- tunately, many of these signs and symptomsare nonspecific. In addition, a number of otherparameters will affect the patient's vital signsand physical findings. For instance, the rapid-ity of volume loss may be as important as thetotal volume of hemorrhage. 2 Underlying car-14 Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patientdiovascular reserve also plays a role. Young people with very compliant blood vessels maycompensate extremely well for large-volume blood loss, even as much as 40% to 50% of total circulating blood volume. 4 They then de- velop sudden cardiovascular compromisewhen compensatory mechanisms fail. Elderlypeople, on the other hand, will develop car-diovascular insufficiency and hypotension withmuch smaller blood loss. 5 Prescription medi- cation and/or illicit drugs will also influencethe cardiovascular response to injury. 6,7 The amount of resuscitation, if any, the patient re- ceives in the field will affect cardiovascular re-sponse as well. 4 Data from the past 10 years strongly sug- gest that normally followed vital signs are avery poor indication of the depth of hemor-rhage. 8 In particular, blood pressure and pulse rate, the two vital signs often used in the emer-gency department to gauge hemorrhage, are tremendously nonspecific. Central venous oxy- gen saturation and mixed venous oxygen satu-ration are far more sensitive and reliable mea-surements of acute volume loss. 8,9 Degree of metabolic acidosis, as measured by the basedeficit from an arterial blood gas, is also ex-tremely helpful in gauging the degree ofshock. 10 Base deficit has been shown to corre- late with transfusion requirements, ICU stay, and ultimate outcome.11,12 During initial resus- citation, base deficit should also correlate withserum lactate level. The ability to clear lactateto normal is one of the most important pre-dictors of survival following hemorrhage andinjury. 13,14 Measures such as mixed venous oxygen content, venous oxygen saturation, blood pres-sure, and lactate concentration are global mea-surements. That is, flow from all vascular beds contributes to this determination. However, some vascular beds are more sensitive than others to the effects of hemorrhage. Thus,shock may be detected earlier if we are able torecognize a local decrease in perfusion. Shockis defined as inadequacy of peripheral oxygendelivery. Clinically, we use indirect measure-ments to gauge hemorrhage. Target organ func-tion such as urine output or mental status areexamples of this. Unfortunately, urine output is extremely variable and nonspecific. Although oliguria almost certainly indicates hypov-olemia, normal urine output or polyuria is in-conclusive. Renal tubular function is affectedby as little as a 20% acute loss of blood vol-ume. The kidney develops a salt-wasting neph-ropathy, and the patient makes more urinethan is appropriate for this degree of physi-ologic insult. 15 Blood flow to the gastrointesti- nal tract, however, is a relatively sensitive indi- cator of the loss of circulating blood volume.Intracellular pH, as measured in the stomach,small bowel, or colon, is a very sensitive mea-sure of hemorrhage. 16 Current technology does not allow us to measure intracellular pH in realtime. However, that technology may be forth-coming in the not-too-distant future. Once the clinician has made the diagno- sis of acute blood loss, several issues become important. Traditional dogma suggests thatrestoration of forward flow by crystalloid re-suscitation followed by blood is optimaltherapy. However, increases in blood pressureproduced by fluid may, in fact, increase bloodloss by displacing the hemostatic clot that wasformed at the time of hypotension. 17 This is- sue will be discussed in Chapter 3. However, there are now data to suggest that sustainedhypotension produces a more injurious shock insult than do multiple episodes of shock andresuscitation. 18 Thus, the clinician must esti- mate the degree of hemorrhage, the depth ofshock, and the time to definitive hemostasiswhen making a decision. Regardless of the resuscitation decision, patients who demonstrate ongoing bleedingrequire definitive hemostasis. Serial blood gasdeterminations and/or central venous oxygensaturation determination may be very helpfulin determining whether blood loss is continu-ing. 8,9 Unfortunately, the relationship between blood loss and physiologic parameters may bedifferent after resuscitation than they were during hemorrhage. For instance, approxi- mately 12 to 16 hours following resuscitation,the relationship changes between base deficitand anion gap versus serum lactate, and an-ion gap and base deficit no longer correlatewith lactate. 19 During this time, one must di- rectly measure serum lactate, as it cannot beinferred from either of the other two measure-ments. When resuscitation decisions are based on these parameters, therapy will be inappro- priate almost 50% of the time. Elderly patients with poor underlying car- diovascular reserve often require invasivemonitoring to precisely measure the physi-ologic deficits and to guide therapy. In fact, inhigh-risk elderly patients (Table 2), monitor-ing must be instituted extremely early, within2 to 3 hours of injury if possible. There is a statistically significant decrease in survival when monitoring is delayed as long as 6 hours. 5 Even young people may have inadequate car-diovascular response to substantial injuries. Asurprising percentage of young patients witheither blunt or penetrating trauma benefit frominvasive monitoring and require volume andpharmacologic therapy to support cardiovas-cular performance and clear lactate. 20,21 Clearly, achieving hemostasis is the most important part of resuscitating the trauma vic- tim. Resuscitation efforts will not be success-ful until blood loss is arrested. Substantial hem-orrhage usually requires operative therapy.Recently, however, other techniques haveemerged and should be considered, even inpatients with hypotension. The diagnosis ofongoing blood loss with angiography and he-mostasis with transcatheter embolization is a real alternative to standard operative therapy. 22 This has been a mainstay of therapy for many years in patients bleeding from a blunt pelvicinjury.

High-Risk Geriatric Patients Initial systolic blood mechanismMassive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patient 5patients is fraught with danger, and emboliza- tion is far preferable in almost every case. Thesetechniques have been extended to other areasof the body. More recently, transcatheter em-bolization has been used for nonoperativemanagement of solid visceral injuries within the abdomen. Treatment algorithms using splenic artery embolization in patients man-aged nonoperatively have resulted in a greaterthan 90% rate of splenic salvage. 23 This is far higher than any series utilizing observationand/or operation alone. In addition,embolotherapy may be extremely helpful inpatients with vascular injuries in relatively in-accessible areas. Exposure of the carotid ar- tery in Zone 3 of the neck is extremely diffi- cult. Embolotherapy has a real role in manag-ing these injuries. Temporary hemostasis canbe achieved with percutaneous balloons usedat the time of diagnostic angiography. This tem-porary control of bleeding allows further im-aging, ongoing resuscitative efforts, and timeto plan definitive therapy. In addition to itsusefulness in Zone 3 of the neck, angiographic hemostasis has great utility in injuries to the thoracic outlet and deep within the pelvis. Embolization techniques can be com- bined with surgery, allowing the patient tobenefit from both techniques. Ideally, thisshould be done in the operating room and, insome centers, biplanar angiography is avail-able. Patients who may benefit from this tech-nology are those with a combination of intra- abdominal blood loss and pelvic blood loss. The pelvic blood loss can be embolized whileintra-abdominal blood loss is treated directlyvia surgery. Sometimes patients are too pro-foundly ill to allow definitive surgery. Damagecontrol techniques should then be employed.In these settings, major vascular injuries arerepaired and gastrointestinal contaminationcontrolled. The patient is then packed withlaparotomy pads and taken to the intensive care unit for ongoing resuscitation and warm- ing techniques. Once patients are resuscitated,they can return to the operating room for un-packing, gastrointestinal reconstruction, andany other procedures necessary. Angiographicembolotherapy has a role in these patients aswell and can be utilized postoperatively tosupplement surgical hemostasis. Injuries deepwithin the substance of the liver, in the retroperitoneum, or in the pelvis may be more easily controlled via embolization than surgery. Early recognition of hemorrhage is key to the optimal care of trauma patients. Ongoingcontroversies exist as to the ideal resuscitationscheme. In fact, there is probably no one idealstrategy. Care must be tailored to the patient'smechanism of injury and physiology.Nonoperative homeostasis can supplement sur- gical techniques and its use should be consid- ered. Normally followed vital signs are very poorindicators of the degree of hemorrhage and theadequacy of resuscitation. Invasive monitoringis often necessary to precisely determine thephysiologic deficit and guide therapy.References 1. Dantzker D. Oxygen delivery and utilization in sepsis.

Dutton, MD Director, Trauma AnesthesiaR Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Maryland School of MedicineBaltimore MD 21201 USAe-mail: rdutton@umaryland.edu Shock\u2014a condition of decreased total body oxygen delivery\u2014can be brought on bya number of mechanisms. These include fail-ure of the heart to pump blood through thebody (cardiogenic), loss of circulating fluidvolume (hemorrhagic), decreased oxygen car-rying (anemic), or loss of vascular tone(neurogenic). 1 \"Traumatic shock\"\u2014shock brought on by an injury in an otherwise healthy patient\u2014is best thought of as a combinationof these factors. The initial phase is usuallyhemorrhagic: the patient bleeds, and perfusiondecreases. This may be followed by an anemicphase as the patient is resuscitated with crys-talloid solutions and simultaneously mobilizesinterstitial fluid into the vasculature. A cardio-genic or neurogenic component may bepresent initially due to specific injuries to theheart or central nervous system (CNS) or may be the secondary result of hypoperfusion and the release of toxic factors. It is important torecognize that the traumatic shock seen clini-cally in severely injured patients may be quitedifferent from the induced shock seen in labo-ratory animals hemorrhaged under controlledconditions. Stages of Shock Traumatic shock may be thought of as26 Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patientoccurring in four phases (Fig. 1). In compen- sated traumatic shock , an increase in heart rate and vasoconstriction of nonessential andischemia-tolerant vascular beds will allow pro-longed survival and easy recovery once coagu-lation occurs and adequate fluids and nutri- tion are provided. Decompensated traumatic shock, also known as progressive shock, is a transitory state in which the lack of perfusionto certain tissues is building up a debt of localcell damage that will produce a toxic effect onthe organism when perfusion is reestablished.Shock is still reversible at this stage. In sub- acute irreversible shock , the patient can be resuscitated hemodynamically but succumbs at a later time to multiple organ system failure as a result of the toxic effects of ischemia andreperfusion. Finally, acute irreversible shock is the condition of ongoing hemorrhage, aci-dosis, and coagulopathy that spirals steadilydownward to the 1,2 The patient whose hemorrhage has pro- ceeded to the point of decompensated shockrepresents a surgical and metabolic emergency. If the loss of blood (and thus the loss of oxy- gen-delivering capacity) can be reversed beforethe inflammatory cascade begins, the patientwill survive. Adequate volume resuscitationleads the patient into higher-than-normal oxy-gen consumption\u2014a hypermetabolic state\u2014for hours to days after the acute injury, as thebody repays the metabolic debt built up dur-ing the period of ischemia. 3 Figure 1 shows this patient following curve C and eventually achieving normal equilibrium. A few minutes too late, however, and sub- acute irreversible shock will have occurred, asrepresented by curve D. Bleeding may be con-trolled and vital signs may be normal or evenhypernormal, but the damage has been doneon the cellular level. Some tissues will continueto be ischemic due to lack of reflow caused bycellular swelling and microcirculatory obstruc- tion. When flow is successfully restored on the cellular level, the process of reperfusion be-gins. This washout of toxins and inflammatoryfactors is as dangerous to the patient as thehemorrhage itself. This is the patient who de-velops adult respiratory distress syndrome thenprogresses to acute renal failure, gut dysfunc-tion, immunosuppression, cardiac failure, andeventual death due to multiple organ system failure. Even though the hemorrhage is stopped short of exsanguination, the body isunable to survive the ischemic insult. 2,4 Curve E in Figure 1 represents acute irre- versible traumatic shock. Prolonged hypoten-sion is followed by progressive vasodilatation,loss of response to fluids and catecholamines,capillary leak, diffuse coagulopathy, cardiacdysfunction, and early death. These patients are usually said to have exsanguinated, al- though in the presence of modern rapid infu-sion techniques and aggressive transfusion, thisis not strictly true. Rather, the patient dies fromthe acute metabolic consequences of failedperfusion, frequently in the presence of ad-equate control of surgical bleeding and volu- minous blood product replacement. 1 The Body's Response to Shock The stages of traumatic shock are directly related to the body's response to hemorrhage.The initial response is on the macrocirculatorylevel and is mediated by the neuroendocrinesystem. Decreased blood pressure leads tovasoconstriction and catecholamine release.Heart and brain blood flow is preserved, whileother regional beds are constricted. Pain, hem-orrhage, and cortical perception of traumatic injuries lead to the release of a number of hor- This response sets the stage for the microcirculatory responses that willultimately determine the patient's outcome. On the cellular level the body responds to hemorrhage by taking up interstitial fluid, causing cells to swell. 6 This may choke off ad- jacent capillaries, resulting in the \"no-reflow\"phenomenon that prevents the reversal of is-chemia even in the presence of adequatemacro flow. 7 Ischemic cells produce lactate and free radicals, which are not cleared by the cir-culation. These compounds cause direct dam-age to the cell, as well as comprising the bulkof the toxic load that will be washed back to the central circulation when perfusion is rees- tablished. The ischemic cell will also of inflammatory factors:prostacyclin, thromboxane, prostaglandins,leukotrienes, endothelin, complement,interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, and oth-ers. 1 These are the ingredients of acute and subacute irreversible shock.Organ System Responses to Traumatic Shock Specific organ systems respond to trau- matic shock in specific ways. The CNS is theprime trigger of the neuroendocrine responseto shock, which maintains perfusion to the heart and brain at the expense of other tissues. 8 Regional glucose uptake in the brain changes during shock.9 Reflex activity and cortical elec- trical activity are both depressed during hy-potension; these changes are reversible withmild hypoperfusion, but become permanentwith prolonged ischemia. Failure to recoverpreinjury neurologic function is a marker forsubacute irreversible shock, even if thepatient's hemodynamic functions are normal. 10 The kidney and adrenal glands are prime responders to the neuroendocrine changes ofshock, producing renin, angiotensin, aldoster-one, cortisol, erythropoietin, and catechola-mines. 11 The kidney itself maintains glomeru- lar filtration in the face of hypotension by se-lective vasoconstriction and concentration ofblood flow in the and deep corticalarea. Prolonged hypotension leads to de- creased cellular energy and an inability to con- centrate urine, followed by patchy cell death,tubular epithelial necrosis, and renal failure. 8,12 The heart is relatively preserved from is- chemia during shock because of maintenanceor even increase of nutrient blood flow, andcardiac function is generally well preserveduntil the late stages. 8,11 Lactate, free radicals, and other humoral factors released by ischemic cells all act as negative inotropes, however, and in the decompensated patient may producecardiac dysfunction as the terminal event inthe shock spiral. 13 The lung, which cannot itself become is- chemic, is nonetheless the downstream filterFigure 1 Traumatic shock and its potential outcomes. A. In early shock there is only a small drop in oxygen delivery due to compensation by the cardiovascular system. B. Decompensated shock is characterized by an accelerating defect in oxygen delivery . C. Recovery from dec- ompensated shock includes a hyperdynamic period as the body's oxygen debt is repaid. D. In subacute irreversible shock, the macrocirculation is restored and bleeding stopped, but hypoperfusion has been severe enough that oxygen debt cannot be repaid. Lethal multiple organ system failure develops. E. Acute irreversible shock occurs when hemodynamic con- trol is never regained. The patient exsanguinates and dies in cardiovascular collapse. Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patient 7for the inflammatory byproducts of the is- chemic body. The lung is often the sentinelorgan for the development of multiple organsystem failure. 4,14 Immune complex and cellu- lar factors accumulate in the capillaries of thelung, leading the acuterespiratory distress syndrome. 15,16 The pulmo- nary response to traumatic shock is the lead-ing evidence that this disease is not just a dis-order of hemodynamics: pure hemorrhage, inthe absence of hypoperfusion, does not pro-duce pulmonary dysfunction. 14,17 The intestine is one of the earliest organs affected by hypoperfusion and may be one of the primary triggers of multiple organ systemfailure. Intense vasoconstriction occurs early,and frequently leads to a \"no-reflow\" phenom-enon even when the macrocirculation is re-stored. 18 Intestinal cell death causes a break- down in the barrier function of the gut, whichresults in increased translocation of bacteriato the liver and lung. 19 The impact of this on the development of multiple organ failure is controversial at present.20 The liver has a complex microcirculation and has been demonstrated to sufferreperfusion injury during recovery fromshock. 21 Hepatic cells are also metabolically active and contribute substantially to the inflam-matory response to decompensated shock. Ir-regularities in blood glucose levels following shock are attributable to hepatic ischemia. 22 Failure of the synthetic functions of the liver following shock are almost always lethal. Skeletal muscle is not metabolically active during shock, and tolerates ischemia betterthan other organs. The large mass of skeletalmuscle, though, makes it important in the gen-eration of lactate and free radicals from is-chemic cells. The classic cellular response toshock of increasing intracellular sodium and free water were first elucidated in skeletal muscle cells. 23 Conclusion Traumatic shock is a disease not just of hemorrhage but also of tissue ischemia. Bleed-ing can be controlled surgically and oxygendelivery restored through adequate transfu-sion, and the patient can still die as a result of the accumulated metabolic load of prolonged hypoperfusion. Although control of bleedingand restoration of the circulating blood vol-ume must remain the cornerstones of care forthe traumatized patient, we must build on thisfoundation techniques for the management ofreperfusion injury, the inflammatory cascade,and \"no reflow\" if we are truly going to im-prove long-term survival.

The process is very effi-cient and utilizes circulating proteins, cellularelements, and the endothelial lining (Fig. 1). 1 The first response to injury is vasoconstriction, which decreases blood flow distal to the lac- eration. The mechanism for vasoconstrictioninvolves both direct injury and reflex re-sponses. Platelets are exposed to subendothe-lial collagen and quickly adhere to each otherand the blood vessel wall. Von Willebrand'sfactor acts as a bridge between thesubendothelium and the platelet membrane,where it binds to receptor sites made available as a result of platelet activation. Other plate- lets are then recruited from the blood, and aloose plug forms to seal the blood vessel. If this response reaches sufficient intensity, the platelet release reaction occurs whereby thecontents of the platelet and its granules are lib-erated into the surrounding microenvironment.This is a complex reaction involving adenosinediphosphate, serotonin, platelet factor plate- let-derived growth factor, thrombin, calcium, and magnesium. 1,2 The result is the formation of a stable platelet plug, which, unlike the ini-tial loose plug, is no longer reversible. Platelet reactions occur simultaneously with the events of the coagulation cascade. Co-agulation serves to convert prothrombin intothrombin, which, in turn, converts fibrinogento fibrin. This process utilizes circulating inac- tive proenzymes, which are converted into an active form and then, in turn, activate the nextproenzyme in the sequence. There are two dis-tinct divisions of the coagulation process: 1) theintrinsic pathway and 2) the extrinsic pathway(Fig. 2). The intrinsic pathway is initiated by theinteraction of Factor XII and nonendothelialsurfaces, which induces a conformationalchange in Factor XII. The complicated reactionsthat follow lead to clotting, kinin formation, complement activation, and fibrinolysis. 1 The extrinsic pathway is the more impor- tant pathway in hemostasis. Thromboplastin,a lipoprotein, is released from cells in responseto tissue trauma. When thromboplastin ispresent, Factor VII becomes active and the se-quence ensues. The two pathways merge into a common pathway with the activation of Factor X, which, in turn, converts prothrombin to thrombin. Fi- brinogen is then acted upon by thrombin, re-sulting in the formation of fibrin monomers.Polymerization occurs,resulting in a cross-linked, stable, fibrin clot. Fibrinolysis is the process that limits the hemostatic response to the local area of injuryand maintains vascular patency throughout theorganism. This system is initiated simultaneously with the clotting mechanism and is under the influence of numerous circulating mediators. Therelease of plasminogen activator from injuredendothelium and XII initiatefibrinolysis. These convert plasminogen to plas-min, which can digest fibrin and fibrinogen at Figure 1. Complex interaction of vasoconstriction, platelet factors, and coagulation reactions. (Reproduced with permission from Mosby-Year Book Inc.) Figure 2. Coagulation reactions.

Other methods the body usesto limit coagulation, which are beyond the scopeof this discussion, include products of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme pathway, protein C, and anti-thrombin III.Abnormalities of Hemostasis Resulting from Injury Injury triggers a vast array of responses that affect hemostasis. Patients may exhibit ei-ther a hypercoagulable or hypocoagulable Severely injured patientshave serum fibrin degradation prod-Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patient 9ucts, lowered platelet counts, and activation of the kallikrein-kinin system.3 In survivors, these values normalize within the first few days afterinjury but continue to worsen in nonsurvivors.Interestingly, a hypercoagulable state is seen in patients with less severe injuries. This is caused by a suppression of thrombolysis. 3 Coagulopathy after injury may also result from the patient's abnormal physiology(hypoperfusion or hypothermia) or the inter-ventions used to treat the patient (massive trans-fusion). It has become clear that prophylacticadministration of fresh frozen plasma or plate-lets in the absence of clinical bleeding is notwarranted. 4,5 Hypothermia has been shown to adversely affect coagulation, and it is important that surgeons and anesthesiologists strive tomaintain normothermia during treatment. In-juries to the brain and liver and those that causeeither hypoperfusion or tissue devitalizationhave significant potential to inducecoagulopathy. 4,5 The importance of the restora- tion of tissue perfusion and debridement ofdevitalized tissue cannot be overemphasized. Priorities in the Operating Room At laparotomy it is absolutely necessary to control hemorrhage and gastrointestinal con-tamination in the most rapid fashion possible.Dr. William Halsted 6 considered this absolutely essential for all types of surgery and eloquentlystated the rationale: The confidence gradually acquired from masterfulness in controlling hemorrhage gives to the surgeon thecalm which is so essential for clearthinking and orderly procedure at theoperating table. It is only after hemorrhage is controlled that a patient's injuries may be addressed in an or-derly fashion (Table 1). Control of gastrointes-tinal contamination is the next goal. Only after these goals are accomplished can a thorough exploration of the abdomen can be conductedand all injuries addressed definitively. The surgeon has a wide range of tools to employ in order to control bleeding (Table 2).The most obvious method is the applicationof digital pressure. Although not definitivecontrol for large vessels, the surgeon's fingeris the most atraumatic instrument available and will control bleeding temporarily while the blood vessel is exposed. The offending bloodvessel must be exposed properly prior to re-pair or ligation. Occasionally, one may needto gain control of the aorta at the diaphrag-matic hiatus to allow the anesthesiologist timeto replace blood and fluids while exposure isbeing accomplished. The patient's condition may not allow all injuries to be addressed fully at initial explo- ration. An abbreviated laparotomy to controlhemorrhage, followed by continued resusci-tation in the intensive care unit, is now an es-tablished concept in trauma surgery. 7 If the patient's condition is deteriorating after con-trol of surgical bleeding and if coagulopathy, hypothermia, and acidosis are present, laparo-tomy sponges may be placed between the ab-dominal wall and the bleeding organ to gaintamponade. The laparotomy is terminatedquickly to allow transfer to the intensive careunit so that coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypo- thermia may be corrected. A second operation is required to remove the packs once thepatient's condition is more stable.The most familiar means of achieving de- finitive hemostasis is the placement of surgi-cal ligatures and clips. These must be placedvery accurately so as not to endanger surround-ing structures. Small vessels may be managedwith simple ligatures; large arteries should be controlled with a suture ligature to prevent slippage of the tie. In very confined spaceswhere the placement of ties would be difficult,surgical clips may be applied. Occasionally an organ such as the liver or spleen may be lacerated, but removal may notbe necessary. Organ-wrapping methods utilizea mesh net to envelope the liver or spleen togain tamponade. This method may be used when other methods to achieve hemostasis fail or where splenectomy or extensivehepatorraphy would otherwise be required. Thermal agents such as electrocautery produce hemostasis by heating and denatur-ing proteins, resulting in coagulation. Both al-ternating and direct current may be employedfor this purpose. This method allows rapid ces-sation of bleeding but may result in large ar- eas of tissue necrosis if applied carelessly. Occasionally an organ such as the liver or spleen may be lacerated, but removal may notbe necessary. Hemostasis may be accomplishedby several methods, such as direct pressure orsuture repair. The liver or spleen may also bewrapped with a mesh netting to envelop theorgan to gain tamponade. This method may beused when other methods to achieve hemosta- sis fail or where splenectomy of extensive hepatorraphy would otherwise be required butmay compromise chances for survival.Table 1.

Comparison of Topical Hemostatic Agents Reproduced with permission from Innovative Publishing Incorporated.10 Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma PatientPharmacologic agents have gained an im- portant place in the surgeon's armamentarium.The mechanisms of action are widely varied:some act by vasoconstriction, some by supply-ing a scaffold for attracting blood elements, andstill others by promoting coagulation per se (Table 3). 8 The ideal topical hemostat would have several properties: 1) rapid hemostasis, 2)easily applied and manipulated, 3) holds su-tures, 4) little tissue reaction, 5) low infectiousrisk, 6) absorbable, and 7) easily removed. Eachof these agents has particular advantages anddisadvantages, which will be discussed in brief. Topical epinephrine is used commonly in applications such as burn surgery and exerts its action by promoting vasoconstriction. The drug can be used to cover wide surfaces, but itmust be applied with caution because systemiceffects may result if excess drug is used. Oxidized cellulose (i.e., Surgicel\u00ae) acts by forming a gelatinous mass on contact withblood. This compound conforms well to ir-regular surfaces, is relatively inert, causes littletissue reaction, and is absorbed in 1 to 2 weeks. In addition, cellulose holds sutures relatively well and is bactericidal. Collagen sponges (Actifoam\u00ae, Helistat\u00ae, Instat\u00ae) and microfibrillar collagen (i.e.,Avitene\u00ae) have a rapid time to hemostasis andare absorbed in approximately 8 to 12 weeks.Sponges are easy to apply and they remove andhold sutures well. Microfibrillar collagen packseasily into small spaces but is difficult to re- move and sticks to gloves and instruments. Thrombin is a protein that converts fi- brinogen to fibrin, resulting in clot formation.Thrombin may be applied as a liquid or pow-der or combined with another carrier such asGelfoam\u00ae. Hemostasis is rapid and wide sur-faces may be treated. Denatured gelatin (i.e,. Gelfoam\u00ae) pos- sesses no clotting activity itself but provides ascaffold on which clot can form. It also helps plug small blood vessels by virtue of its bulk when moistened. It may be used as a carrierfor other compounds such as thrombin. Thesponge should be pre-moistened with eithersaline or thrombin and all air should be re-moved from the interstices by compressing thesponge. Gelatin conforms well to surfaces, butit does not hold sutures. Fibrin sealants have numerous applica- tions within the field of surgery, including nerve anastomoses, intracranial operations,skin grafting, and cardiovascular procedures. 9 Fibrin glue has also been used as a hemostaticagent in trauma surgery for lacerations of theliver and spleen. In the presence of calciumions, fibrinogen and Factor XIII are activatedby thrombin. Fibrinogen is to fibrinmonomers and these, in turn, are polyme rized to form a stable clot. Fibrin glue has two components that must be mixed together for clotting to occur. Theprimary parts of the first component are fibrino-gen and Factor XIII. The second componentconsists of thrombin and calcium chloride. Anantifibrinolytic agent such as aprotinin may be added to the second solution, depending onspecific requirements. 9 When these two parts are combined, clotting ensues. The glue maybe applied by two methods: 1) In the \"sand-wich technique,\" the fibrinogen is spread onto the surface to be sealed and the thrombin solu- tion spread over it. 2) The premixed methoduses two syringes joined by a Y-connector. Ochsner et used fibrin glue as the pri- mary hemostatic agent or as an adjunct to con-ventional suture repair in 26 patients with he-patic and splenic trauma. 10 Seventeen patients had liver injuries (6 blunt and 11 penetrating)and 9 had splenic injuries (7 blunt and 2 pen- etrating). Liver injuries ranged from moderate to severe and the splenic injuries were allmoderate. Fibrin glue achieved hemostasis in21 patients with the first application and withthe second in the remaining five. No patientswere re-explored for bleeding. Eight patientshad the fibrin glue hemostasis re-mained effective. A controlled in vitro review of topical he- mostatic agents was undertaken by Wagner etal. 11 The tested agents included three types of collagen sponges (Actifoam\u00ae, Helistat\u00ae,Instat\u00ae), microfibrillar collagen Actifoam\u00ae andAvitene\u00ae caused the greatest response (bothstatistically in an in vitro platelet ag- gregation Surgicel\u00ae,and Instat\u00ae caused a lesser degree of plateletaggregation. In test using thrombin topresoak each agent, platelet aggregation oc-curred at a more rapid rate for all agents tested. The agents were also tested in their abil- ity to induce gross blood coagulation (Lee-White clotting time). Actifoam\u00ae, Avitene\u00ae, andHelistat\u00ae responded in similar to thrombin, but Instat\u00ae, Gelfoam\u00ae, and Surgicel\u00ae demonstrated no significant impacton clotting time. Wagner et al, using the above assays as well as tests of platelet deposition and platelet triphosphate Helistat\u00ae >>Gelfoam\u00ae > Instat\u00ae > Surgicel\u00ae. It should be noted that, although this ranking notes dif- ferences between the agents for these in vitro assays, it is certainly limited when consideringthe numerous clinical situations encounteredby surgeons in a wide variety of subspecialties. Heat energy has a significant role in treating the hypothermic trauma patient.Hypothermia causes platelet dysfunction andprolongs clotting times. 12 Laboratory assays underestimate the extent to which hypoth- ermia affects bleeding, since the plasma andtest reagents are heated to 37 \u00b0C prior to run- ning the assay. Because of this, coagulationtest results and platelet counts may not cor-relate with nonsurgical bleeding.Other Invasive Interventions Numerous other tools for hemorrhage control may be used in the field, emergency department, or radiologic suite (Table 4). Al- though the surgeon does not necessarily per-form all of these procedures, he or she shouldbe responsible for combining them into a logi-cal strategy for prompt control of bleedingwhen surgical methods cannot be used. The pneumatic antishock garment is used to control bleeding temporarily in patients withpelvic and lower extremity fractures by acting as a splint to tamponade bleeding. It can be used for hypovolemic shock, but it is only atemporizing measure. Prolonged use may beassociated with numerous complications, suchas compartment syndrome. The external pelvic fixator may be defini- tive in stopping bleeding from veins lining frac-tured pelvic bones. It is most effective in pa-tients with fractures associated with a diasta- sis of the pubic symphysis (\"open-book\" pel- vic fractures), since it draws the anterior ele-ments together. This decreases the potentialspace into which bleeding may occur. The ex-ternal fixator is not effective for fractures in-volving only the posterior elements of the pel-vic ring or in controlling bleeding from thearteries coursing through the pelvis. For patients with bleeding from pelvic fractures in whom an external fixator is not effective, bleeding from arteries in the pelvis must be suspected and angiography should beperformed. If an offending vessel is identified,embolization may be carried out with eitherGelfoam\u00ae or metal microcoils (Fig. 3). While Fig. 3. Microcoils used in pelvic arterial embolization.

I would be remiss if I did not emphasize the importance of the anesthesia service in themanagement of these patients. Surgeons mustfocus on control of bleeding at the surgical site.Anesthesiologists provide the necessary factorsto assist in the correction of surgical bleedingand the prevention of nonsurgical bleeding.The proper transfusion of blood componenttherapy has important implications for control of bleeding, since platelets and coagulation factors may be required by severely injuredpatients. Anesthesiologists must also focus onthe maintenance of normothermia to pre-vent coagulopathy. Effective communicationbetween the surgeon and anesthesiologist isessential. The surgeon must alert the anesthe-siologist to bleeding at the surgical site, so thatcorrective methods may be undertaken. Summary Control of blood loss is one of the most important priorities in the trauma patient. Wehave discussed several methods of obtaininghemostasis. These include standard surgicaltechniques such as digital pressure and su-tures. We have focussed much of our atten-tion on pharmacologic methods, specifically topical hemostatic agents. Each of these agentshas particular advantages and disadvantagesand must be applied to the appropriate situa-tion. There are other invasive techniques thatmay not be performed by the surgeon but that must be orchestrated by the surgeon into a clear strategy for hemorrhage control. The an-esthesiologist has an important role in help-ing to control hemorrhage by appropriatetransfusion therapy but, more importantly, pre-venting bleeding at the surgical site by meth-ods such as maintaining normothermia.

It is found in the mast cells of all mammalian species as well as many lower orders of life. Unfortunately, at this time, wedo not understand the true physiologic roleof aprotinin in nature. What is known is that high doses of the drug inhibit a number of the inflammatoryprocesses involved with open heart surgeryand also modify the haemostatic system to al-low reductions in bleeding and thus the need for blood and blood products. The use of high-dose aprotinin therapy followed reportsof the potential benefit of this approach intraumatically injured patients. 1 Large-dose aprotinin therapy has been shown to be ex-tremely effective, and safe, in preventingblood loss and the need for blood and bloodproducts in patients undergoing open heartsurgery. The current literature contains more than 40 reports of randomised placebo-con- trolled studies 2,3 that have shown that high-dose aprotinin therapy reduced drain losses (range, 35%-81%), the total amount of trans-fusions (range, 35%-97%), and the propor-tion of patients requiring transfusions ofblood or blood products (range, 40%-88%).Since the first description of the haemostatic actions of high-dose aprotinin therapy in pa- tients undergoing re-operation 4 or high-risk cardiac procedures, this agent has been thestandard of care in this situation and is theonly product licensed for use for this indica-tion in North America. The aim of this article is to discuss the potential for this anti-inflammatory andhaemostatic action to benefit patients having elective orthopaedic and trauma surgery and also following trauma itself. The article is di-vided into three major sections dealing with The use of drugs to prevent bleeding dur- ing elective surgery The potential for aprotinin therapy in pa- tients who have sustained trauma The potential use of serine protease in- hibitors to prevent certain sequelae oftrauma and surgery of bones, joints, andtendonsMany forms of bone and joint surgery are associated with a significant risk of bleedingand thus the use of blood and blood prod-ucts. 5 A number of systems have been used to reduce this probability. Some of these are al-most unique to orthopaedic surgery, such ascreating a bloodless field by tourniquet ap- plication in limb surgery. In addition, in many countries, orthopaedic and trauma surgeonshave become the principle users ofpredonated blood and blood product sys-tems. However, there is still significant scopefor the use of other techniques and methods,such as pharmacologic intervention, to inhibitbleeding and minimize the need for blood andblood product transfusions. Nonemergency Orthopaedic Surgery The three most commonly used pharma- aprotinin. Eachof these agents has a relatively unique modeof action, although there is overlap betweensome of the physiologic events produced by these agents. Desmopressin is a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone argenine vasopressin andhas been shown to increase plasma levels of12 Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma PatientFigure 1 Total numbers of transfused red cells in patients undergoingorthopaedic surgery for removal of infected bioprosthesis or resection of tumour with and without aprotinin therapy. Individual patient data are shown and demonstrate an average three-fold reduction in need for blood products in patients given aprotinin therapy. Data are drawn from Capdevila et al. 17 factor VIII activity in patients withhemophilia and Von Willebrand'sdisease type I. Desmopressin hadconsiderable support for use incomplex heart surgery, but morerecent data suggest that, overall, this drug provided little, if any, benefit to the patient. Conversely,more recent data suggest that theuse of desmopressin in patientswho are currently taking aspirintherapy has significant benefitduring and after heart surgery. 6,7 The results with desmopressin inorthopaedic surgery have been universally poor. 8 However, at present, there is little informationabout the use of this agent in pa-tients taking aspirin or non-steroi-dal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) prior to surgery. This isobviously an area that needs fur-ther investigation. With regard to tranexamic acid, there are again few data to support its use for surgery of cen-tral bones and joints, such as spine and hipsurgery. Some reports indicate a reduction inthe requirement for blood in patients who arehaving knee replacement surgery under tour-niquet. 9,10 Aprotinin therapy has been used with ef- fect in a wide variety of surgeries, including orthopaedic surgery. There is, however, still only one report from a randomised placebo-controlled study in patients undergoing pri-mary hip surgery. 11 This shows a significant benefit of high-dose aprotinin therapy to re-duce drain losses and the need for donor bloodand blood products. The dose of aprotininused in this study from Belgium was intendedto be equivalent to the high-dose regimen usedduring cardiac surgery. A number of other studies have shown an effect of lower doses of aprotinin on variablessuch as platelet function but without showingconsistent benefit to reduce the requirementfor transfusions. 12-16 It appears that a higher dose of aprotinin is needed to ensure reducedblood transfusions than the dose that will havesignificant effects on haemostatic processes. Similarly, there is evidence that the greater the surgical risk, the more benefit the high- dose regimen appears to demonstrate. For ex-ample, a recent article 17 showed that aprotinin therapy produced a three-fold reduction in theneed for blood and blood products in patientsundergoing hip replacement because the jointhad become infected or invaded by tumor (Fig.1). This massive reduction in the requirementsfor blood and blood products is similar to the observations in heart surgery, where the higher the risk of bleeding, the more obvious is thebenefit of aprotinin therapy. In addition,aprotinin therapy has been used with benefitin patients undergoing spinal surgery. 18Soft Tissue Injury and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy (DIC) The use of blood-sparing agents in trauma surgery has potential in soft tissue injury andin patients with intraabdominal (especiallyhepatic) trauma. Severe soft-tissue injury pre-sents a variety of challenges with problemsassociated with the initial event, the subse-quent potential for ischaemia reperfusion in-jury, and the development of a coagulopathy during resuscitation. Soft-tissue trauma is associated with the release of a number of procoagulant media-tors, which can lead to a form of disseminatedintravascular coagulation and haemorrhage.The use of factors to promote haemostasis andprevent bleeding in these circumstances is stillcontroversial. The use of apureantifibrinolytics, such as a lysine analogue, is potentially lethal in these circumstances. These drugs are therefore contraindicated in the pres-ence of intravascular thrombin generation.Indeed, in animal models, the use of lysineanalogue antifibrinolytics such as tranexamicacid with excess thrombin generation leads tothe death of the animal. 19-21 In contrast to the effects of these lysine analogue agents are the effects of serine pro- tease inhibitors. A number of odious models of tissue injury in animals have shown signifi-cantly high early mortality. These models in-clude rotating drum experiments with rats andfracture/sepsis models in sheep. In both theseexperimental models, the use of aprotinintherapy prevented mortality and improvedoutcome. 22 A number of animal models to- gether with anecdotes about humans suggest that aprotinin therapy in addition to heparin inhibits the DIC associated with trauma andsepsis. 19,21,23 There are also a number of studies fromthe early literature in which aprotinin was administered topatients who had sustainedtrauma, particularly road trafficcrashes. The majority of these pa-pers are found in the German lit- erature. In one multiple centre study published in 1976, 24 4,686 patients were entered into a mul-tiple centre study to investigatethe effects of aprotinin therapyin the treatment of traumaticshock. The dosage used low\u2014approximately 3 mil-lion KIU a 2-day period\u2014 but an impressive ben- efit to the patient outcome whenadministered within a few hoursof the trauma. The most signifi-cant benefits of the use ofaprotinin therapy were found inpatients with injuries to the up-per extremity and soft tissues,but there were significant ben- efits following trauma to the lower limb and spine as well. The study found no benefit of the use of aprotinintherapy in patients with either chest or headinjury (Fig. 2). Most recently, a number of studies have focused on aprotinin therapy following bluntliver trauma. These investigations appear to bea natural progression from studies that inves- tigated this therapy in patients having liver transplantation. In both an animal 25 and a hu- man26 study, significant benefits were achieved in terms of reduction in bleeding and the needfor donor blood in liver trauma and resection. These data suggest that aprotinin therapy may be beneficial in certain patients with soft-tissue injury and intraabdominal trauma. Antiinflammatory Actions In addition to the potential haemostatic benefits of the use of aprotinin in patientsundergoing elective surgery and in those whohave been injured, there are also a number ofother actions of the drug that may benefit thepatient. These are related to its anti-inflam-matory and anticoagulant actions. 27 All serine protease inhibitors, including aprotinin, will inhibit platelet function. This is achieved by a number of mechanisms re- lated to the ability to inhibit surface recep-tors and by intracellular metabolism pro-cesses. Indeed, the first use of aprotinintherapy in patients having hip surgery was asan adjunct to the use of heparin to preventdeep venous thrombosis after surgery. 12,14 Pre- liminary data from these studies (involvingsmall numbers of patients) suggest a small but statistically significant effect to reduce the incidence of venous thrombosis. This effectneeds to be investigated in larger groups ofpatients using various forms of antithromboticprophylaxis in addition to aprotinin therapyto determine if there is a significant benefitMassive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patient 13Figure 2 Percentage mortality in groups of patients with trauma and tissue injury with ( hatched bars ) and without ( clear bars ) aprotinin therapy.

There was no significant difference between treatment and no treatment in patients with predominantly head injury. in this respect togetherwith a reduction in therequirement for bloodand blood products.Other reports suggestthat the incidence and severity of pulmonary fat embolism and the fat em-bolus syndrome followingtrauma are reduced sig-nificantly with aprotinintherapy. 28,29 A further conse- quence of effects on lism to showthat aprotinin therapy isassociated with improvedmicrovascular blood flow. 27 This improved flow together with modi-fications to the metabolicprocess may explain whythere is a significant re-duction in the amount of lactic acid producedafter ischaemia reperfusion in patients under-going hip surgery those undergoing vascular surgery with aorto-bifemoral replace- ment.31 One potential area for the use of aprotinin as a treatment after bone surgery is to inhibitthe oedema that occurs after trauma to boneand periosteum. Oedema formation can be as-sociated with considerable discomfort. A num-ber of studies suggest that the local infiltra-tion of aprotinin significantly reduces both theoedema formation and the pain associated withbone surgery. This is especially true for pa- tients requiring maxillofacial surgery and den- tal extraction. 32 Finally, there is the potential for the use of aprotinin and other protease inhibitors tobe used prophylactically and in treatment ofpatients with progressive joint destruction orfollowing joint and tendon repair. It is becom-ing increasingly recognised that many of thecells in cartilage to produce proteolytic en- zymes, which may be responsible for chronic joint destruction. 33 More modern methods of molecular biology suggest that one of the ma-jor participants in this process is the genera-tion of plasmin from a urokinase plasminogentype activator. This activity is inhibited byaprotinin therapy in tissue culture. 33 The ra- tionale for using intra-articular aprotinintherapy is suggested by the observation that chondrocytes produce a number of protease inhibitors of the proteolytic enzymes such asthe plasminogen activators. One of the majorinhibitors thus far categorised from humanchondrocytes is a 6-kD molecule that has re-markable, if not identical, amino acid sequencehomology with aprotinin. 34 Preliminary data from human studies sug- gest that the chronic injection of aprotinin intothe joint space is associated with a significant inhibition of progression of disease. 35 A simi- lar mechanism may also play a part in the useof aprotinin therapy to prevent adhesion for-mation and fibrosis following tendon repair. 36 Summary and Conclusion The use of aprotinin therapy in sufficiently high doses is associated with an improvementin haemostatic function and a reduction in drain losses and blood utilisation in patients undergoing major trauma surgery and ortho-paedic surgery. The anti-inflammatory actionsof aprotinin may also have significant benefitin reducing mortality after soft tissue traumaalone and especially in those traumas associ-ated with increased risk of embolic phenom-ena or intravascular coagulation. Althoughdrugs such as tranexamic acid have value in patients requiring certain joint replacement surgeries, their safety in the presence of aprothrombotic state is not proven. Therefore,at this stage, it seems inappropriate to recom-mend these drugs for patients with soft tissuetrauma. The use of drugs such as desmopressinin otherwise routine surgery has, as yet, noproven benefit, although there may be somebenefit to patients who are taking anti-inflam- matory medicines. In addition to the benefit of reducing bleeding, protease inhibitors can improve pa-tient outcome by reducing ischaemic injuryand the oedema formation that may cause pain.At present, safety data on the use of aprotinintherapy in both open heart surgery and ortho-paedic/trauma surgery suggest that the benefits of this drug can be obtained without increas-ing the risk of a thrombotic episode. Whetherthe incidence of thrombosis can be reducedfurther of a protease in-hibitor with other antithrombotic prophylaxis remains to be investigated. 1. Clasen C, Jochum M, Mueller Esterl W .

Also associated with appreciableDVT risk are comorbid conditions such as age greater than 40; obesity; malignancy; pregnancy, up to 1 month postpartum; use of oral contra-ceptives; and lung operations. 7 Virchow noted in the 19th century that DVT was initiated by one or more of the followingconditions: stasis of blood flow in the deep veinsof the leg, trauma to the endothelial lining of theveins, and increased coagulability of the blood.Because trauma patients are at risk for the entire Virchow's triad, they are at increased risk of DVT and thus PE. Aside from the obvious vasculartrauma and venous stasis caused by bed rest, theinflammatory state of trauma (e.g., cytokine re-5 morbidity, anesthesiologists are faced withpatients who receive LMWH forDVT, which may preclude the use of epiduralcatheters. 3,5 In this article, the risks and natu- ral history of DVT and recommendations foruse of continuous epidural anesthesia includes both DVT and PE\u2014is a major post- traumatic morbidity and mortality issue. 1,2 Di- rect trauma to blood vessels and thrombophiliaassociated with the general inflammatory re-sponse to traumatic injury lead to an increasedincidence of DVT and subsequent pulmonaryembolism (PE). 7 The overall incidence of DVT in the North American and European popula-tions is 1 in 1,000. It occurs more frequently in older people, obese people, and patients with traumatic injury. Some injury patternssuch as spinal cord injury are associated witha very high incidence of DVT.13.

Venography is the goldstandard of diagnosis for DVT, allowing fillingdefects to be seen after injection of contrastdye in a peripheral limb vein. Approximately2% of DVTs occur in the upper extremities, with a risk of 12% for PE from an upper-extremity DVT. 13 Upper-extremity DVT is diagnosed by detection of obstruction to flow in the deepveins of the shoulder or upper arm. PE is diagnosed by physical examination, radioisotopic symptoms of PE include pleuritic pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, abnormal breath sounds, atrial dysrhythmias, hypoxia,and an increase in arterial to end tidal carbondioxide gradient. The presence of a knownDVT increases the probability that these signsand symptoms represent a PE. A perfusiondefect not matched with a simultaneous venti-lation defect demonstrates a PE on radioiso-topic V/Q scans. 11 Spiral CT of the chest en- hanced with contrast medium may reveal a fill-ing defect of a major branch of the pulmonaryartery in patients with PE. 10 A pulmonary ar- tery angiogram remains the gold standard fordiagnosing PE by revealing filling defects in the pulmonary artery or its branches. Treatment of known DVT is anticoagula- tion to prevent further propagation of heparinization usu-ally performed with intravenous heparin ti-trated to a PTT in the range of 60 to 80 sec-onds. Because patients with one episode ofDVT are at risk for another episode, therapeu-tic heparinization is usually followed by 3 months to a lifetime of warfarin or long-term subcutaneous LMWH. 14 Treatment of PE is mostly supportive of pulmonary function along with administrationof heparin to prevent further clot buildup.Heparin dose is adjusted for PTT of 60 to 80seconds. Embolectomy of the pulmonary ar-tery has been used for \"saddle emboli\" ob-structing both branches of the pulmonary ar- tery, but embolectomy must be initiated almost immediately to be effective. Prevention of DVT relies on a combination of mechanical methods such as stockings, se-quential compression devices, or foot pumpsand pharmacologic techniques (Table 4). Infe-rior vena caval filters are designed to prevent PEbut have no effect on the development of DVT. Pharmacologic prevention of DVT has been attempted warfarin, pre-venting PE, and has fewer complications. 4,2,15 Because of its ease of use, efficacy, and low incidence of side effects, LMWH is the drug of choice for DVT prophylaxis in trauma patients.Table 5 lists the recommended doses and dos-ing intervals for available LMWH, as well as thecurrent indications for these drugs. The complications of much less likely to cause osteopenia than unfractionated heparin, but both are likelyto cause HIT. 7 For patients who develop HIT, DVT propylaxis and treatment of PE can be controlledwith danaparoid or hirudin. The use of regional anesthesia in trauma patients receiving anticoagulation therapy forDVT prophylaxis requires the compulsive fol-lowing of guidelines to prevent epidural he- matomas. 3,5 Table 6 lists recommendations for epidural catheter use in patients receivingLMWH. With the use of sequential compres-sion devices during periods when LMWH can-not be administered safely, prophylaxis againstvenous thromboembolic disease as well as ex-Table 3.

This thromobophilia may cause multiple microvascu-lar thrombin formation and DIC or lead to large-scale thrombus in the deep veins of the leg. Patients with congenital forms of throm- bophilia are at especially high risk for DVT and PE. These inborn errors of metabolism (Table 1) vary in incidence from 3% to 4% in the popu-lation for activated protein C resistance (Fac-tor V Leiden) to 0.02% for antithrombin defi-ciency. 7 Although protein C and protein S de- ficiency were involved in the earliest descrip-tions of thrombophilia, they are not nearly ascommon as factor V Leiden deficiency.Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is also a risk factor for arterial thrombosis such as coronary arterial occlusion, may be related folic acid,vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 deficiency and itsincidence is not well defined. 9 The main reason to worry about DVT in the trauma patient is fatal PE. PE occurs symp-tomatically in 30% of patients as-ymptomatic PE increases the overall incidenceof PE to 50% to 60% in patients with DVT. The death rate caused by PE is 50,000 per year in the United States. Because there is no adequatetreatment for a diagnosed PE and diagnosis isdifficult, prevention of DVT is the most effec-tive measure to reduce the incidence of PE. 7,8 Therefore, many trauma patients will receiveDVT prophylaxis, and the use of LMWH is themost effective prophylaxis. DVT is diagnosed with physical tion, markers such Doppler, and venog- raphy (Table 2).10-12 Symptoms and signs of DVT include pain, a venous cord along the leg,edema distal to the occlusion, and pain in-duced by forceful dorsiflexion of the foot.

Summary The use of LMWH for reducing the risk of DVT and PE has gained increasing popularityin trauma patients with pelvic fractures requir- ing operative fixation or prolonged (>5 days) bed rest, in patients with complex lower extrem-ity fractures requiring operative fixation or pro-longed bed rest, and in spinal-cord-injured pa-tients with complete or incomplete motor pa-ralysis. However, the use of LMWH in traumacan be a challenge, necessitating a fine balancebetween bleeding risk and DVT/PE risk. Thereare many unresolved issues concerning the use of antithrombotics in trauma patients, which require further investigation, especially in pa-tients receiving continuous neuraxial analgesia.5.

Cardiopulmonary bypass and vascular surgery have established unwashed filter autotransfusion as a safe andpractical means to supplement homologousblood usage. During major orthopedic surgi-cal procedures, autotransfusion has been dem-onstrated to reduce blood requirements. The properties of an ideal autotransfusion system include 1) ease of operation, 2) rela-tively low cost, 3) in-line filtration system, 4) simplified anticoagulation, 5) high fluid aspi- ration rate and minimal hemolysis whetherevacuating a pool of blood or surface skim-ming from the operative field, and 6) the abil-ity to concentrate the aspirated blood. The BloodStream Recovery System (BRS) (Harvest Technologies LLC, Norwell, Massa-chusetts) (Fig. 1) is a surgical suction systemthat automatically senses the pressures re- quired and adjusts from 20 to 40 mmHg dur- ing surface skimming and a maximum of 100mmHg when evacuating a pool of blood. Dur-ing trauma and cardiovascular surgery , the BRScan be utilized as a stand-alone autotransfusionsystem by transferring from the collection res-ervoir to a reinfusion bag that contains an in-tegral 40-micron filter. During orthopedic sur-gery, the BRS can be used as the front-end col-lection system to cell-washing systems by con- necting the BRS reservoir to the intake line ofthe cell-washing machine. Methods The BloodStream was compared with wall suction (SS) at vacuum pressures of 100 to 450mmHg during blood pool evacuation and sur-face skimming. A variety of suction wands wereused with both suction systems. Multiple red cell pools were required for the studies. The pools are identified by dura- tion of storage, hematocrit, and pertinent con- trol values.Results Results obtained during evacuation of a pool of blood are shown in Tables 1 and 2.Flow rates obtained with the BRS are more thantwice those obtained with a Yankauer or Fraziersuction want at vacuum pressures of 100 and150 mmHg (Table 1). The latter level is greater than that recommended for autotranfusion or intraoperative blood salvage. When theBloodStream serves as the vacuum source, flowrates obtained with Yankauer and Frazier suc-tion wands are comparable to those obtainedwith a wall suction system at 200 mmHg (T ables1 and 2).

Initial evalu-ation of the patient will include an estimate ofblood volume deficit (Table 1), rate of addi-tional blood loss, primary and secondary sur-vey according to ATLS principles, and anevaluation of cardiopulmonary reserve and co-existing hepatic or renal dysfunction. 1 The major goal in resuscitation is to stop the bleed- ing and replete intravascular volume to maxi- mize tissue oxygen delivery. Cardiac output,blood pressure, and oxygenated blood flow tovital organs are important determinants of out-come. Management priorities in the trauma pa- tient who is bleeding acutely include ventila-tion and oxygenation; measurement of bloodpressure; placement of ECG, pulse oximeter, and capnograph; and establishment or verifi- cation of adequate intravenous (IV) access forinfusion of normothermic fluids (See alsothen be used for maintenance of general anes- thesia until the intravascular volume deficit has been corrected and bleeding is under control. Neuromuscular relaxants, benzodiazepines,and other agents are given as clinically indi-cated. 2 Fluid Options There is controversy about which IV solu- tions should be used for resuscitation. Duringhemorrhage, the interstitial space, in addition to the intravascular compartment, is dimin- ished, with a compensatory increase in reab-sorption of fluid into the capillaries. To repletethe intravascular and interstitial compartment, crystalloid solutions Glucose-containing ner- system injury. 4,5 Lactated Ringer's solution has an osmo-lality 273 mOsm/L, which ishypotonic with respect toplasma. Moreover, lactatedRinger's cannot be used to dilutepacked red blood cells. Thus,0.9% saline is preferred. Colloidsolutions such as hetastarch have been shown to be as effective as 5% albumin for volume expan-sion. Hetastarch is used after theTable 3 illustrates an example of the results obtained during surface skimming. As one in-creases the vacuum pressure, there is a tendencyfor the Frazier wand to grab onto tissue, reduc-ing the flow rate and increasing red cell dam-age. The BRS has significantly greater flow and results in significantly less damage to red cells, as determined by plasma hemoglobin levels. Awall suction vacuum pressure of 200 mmHg isrequired to achieve the flow rate obtained withthe BRS at 40 mmHg. However, this results in atwo-fold increase in plasma hemoglobin. The BRS system can be used for autotransusion of unwashed shed blood dur-ing cardiac and vascular surgery. Conclusions The BloodStream system can rapidly evacuate a pool of blood at more than twicethe flow rate achieved with a wall suction sys-tem at recommended pressures. TheBloodStream results in significantly less dam-age to red cells as determined by plasma he-moglobin levels compared with wall suction. The data demonstrate that the BloodStream system can be used as a stand-alone mobilesurgical suction system in operating rooms,emergency departments, and trauma centers.Table 3.

Large amounts of hetastarch(>15-20 ml/kg) are avoided because of the riskof coagulopathy. 6 Delayed Fluid Resuscitation The use of large quantities of fluids for immediate resuscitation of victims of penetrat-ing trauma before hemorrhage is controlledby surgical means has been questioned. 7 Dis- advantages of immediate fluid resuscitation arethat inserting venous cannulae and giving fluidboluses in the prehospital setting may delay transfer and surgical intervention, may contrib- ute to secondary hemorrhage by disrupting ordecreasing resistance to flow around a partiallyformed thrombus or by increasing blood pres-sure, may dilute clotting factors, and can con-tribute to hypothermia. In a randomized, pro-spective trial of immediate versus delayed fluidresuscitation in patients with penetratingtrauma, there was increased mortality, length of stay, and postoperative complication rate in the immediate versus the delayed group. 7 How- ever, the study was limited to isolated torsoinjuries, and the receiving trauma center hada very rapid response time such that most pa-tients were in the operating room within 1hour of injury. Therefore, results of this studymay not be applicable to other types of inju-ries such as blunt trauma, head injury, and multiple sites of penetrating trauma or to pa- tients in remote locations requiring long trans-port times. Red Cell Transfusion The lower limit of anemia is not estab- lished in humans. Oxygen delivery is gener-ally adequate with a hemoglobin of 7 g/dl,which corresponds to an oxygen delivery of~500 ml/min in a 70-kg patient, assuming nor- mal cardiac output and hemoglobin/oxygen saturation. In otherwise healthy, normovolemicindividuals, Messmer and hematocrit between 18% and 25%. Theheart and brain are often considered to be mostvulnerable to the effects of anemia. The heartbegins to produce lactic acid at hematocritsbetween 15% and 20%, 9 and heart gen- hematocrit 10%.10 Generally, hematocrits between 25% and 30% result inoptimal oxygen delivery, but therapy must beindividualized. 11 Factors affecting the transfusion trigger for red cells include the rate and magnitude ofblood loss; degree of cardiopulmonary reserve;presence of atherosclerotic disease of thebrain, heart, and kidneys; and oxygen con- sumption. 11 If the patient has lost large amounts of blood and is in class III or IV shock(see table on page 4), blood administration isrequired. 2 Available options are type O-nega- tive, type-specific, typed and screened, or typedand cross-matched packed red blood cells.Whole blood is not available at the author's institution. The initial choice will depend onthe degree of hemodynamic instability. Oneunit of packed red blood cells will usually in-crease the hematocrit by ~3% or the hemo-globin by 1 g/dl in a 70-kg non-bleeding adult. Type O-negative red cells have no major antigens and can be given reasonably safely topatients with any blood type. Unfortunately,only 8% of the population has O-negativeblood, and blood bank reserves of O-negative,low-antibody-titer blood are usually very low.For this reason, O-positive red cells are fre-quently used. This is a reasonable approach inmales but may be a problem in childbearing- aged females who are Rh negative. If 50% to 75% of the patient's blood vol- ume has been replaced with type O blood (e.g.,~10 units of red cells in an adult patient), oneshould continue to administer type O red cells.Otherwise, risk of a major cross-match reac-tion increases since the patient may have re-ceived enough anti-A or anti-B antibodies toprecipitate hemolysis if A, B, or AB units are subsequently given. 2 Obtaining type-specific red cells requires 5 to 10 minutes in most institutions, and tem-porizing measures can sometimes be em-ployed to gain the necessary time. At our insti-tution, we use a tube system to deliver bloodsamples and products to and from the operat-ing room or trauma resuscitation suite. Thissystem significantly reduces delays and \"lost\" samples. The use of type-specific red cells is preferred over O-negative and the risk of ahemolytic transfusion reaction is very low. 12 If one can wait 15 minutes, typed and screenedblood should be available. When blood is typedand screened, the patient's blood group isidentified and the serum is screened for majorblood group antibodies. A full cross matchgenerally requires about 45 minutes and in-volves mixing donor cells with recipient serum to rule out any antigen/antibody reactions. 13 Coagulation Factors and Platelets The primary cause of bleeding after trauma is surgical, while the second leadingcause is hypothermia. In the past, coagulopathyafter massive transfusion with whole blood was usually caused by dilutional thrombocytope-nia. However, this is not necessarily the case with red cells reconstituted in 0.9% saline. Murray et al have shown that microvascularbleeding and clinical evidence of coagulopathyoccurred in the setting of massive transfusionand was associated with decreased coagulationfactor levels, decreased fibrinogen, elevatedprothrombin times and platelet counts>100,000/ \u00b5l. 14,15 Moreover, administration of fresh frozen plasma corrected the microvascu- lar bleeding. Two units of fresh frozen plasma (10-15 ml/kg) will achieve 30% factor activityin most adults. Coagulation factor deficienciesmay be present due to other causes such aspreexisting defects or disseminated intravas-cular coagulopathy resulting from tissue injury.Cryoprecipitate may then be indicated to cor- rect specific factor deficiencies. It should benoted that 1 unit of fresh whole blood or 1unit of single-donor apheresis platelets also hassimilar factor levels as 1 unit of fresh frozenplasma. Similarly, 4 to 5 multiple donor plate- let units have similar factor levels as 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma because the platelets aresuspended in plasma. Dilutional thrombocytopenia in the trauma patient also occurs. Leslie and Toy 16 showed that platelet count was reduced to<50,000/ \u00b5l after administration of 20 units of red cells. Platelet transfusions are usually in-dicated in the presence of clinical bleeding and a platelet count <75,000 to 100,000/ \u00b5l. Plate- let concentrates are stored at room tempera-ture and contain about 70% of the platelets ina unit of blood. One unit of platelets, equiva-lent to 50 ml, increases the platelet count inan adult by 5,000 to 10,000/ \u00b5l, and is given through a 170- \u00b5 filter. Hypertonic Fluids Lesser amounts of hypertonic fluids, as opposed to isotonic fluids, can also providerapid volume expansion and improved hemo-dynamics and have the added advantage ofdecreasing tissue edema, intracranial pressure,and brain water. These an of extracel-lular the in-travascular half-life is simi- lar to that of isotonic saline, these fluids can be combined with colloid solutions such ashetastarch or dextran to prolong their plasmavolume expansion effects. Hypertonic salinehas been associated with bleeding, hemody-namic deterioration, and increased mortalityin animal studies of uncontrolled hemorrhagicshock. 17 Further, it does not improve cerebral oxygen delivery after head injury and mildhemorrhage in animals. 18 Nonetheless, hyper- tonic saline combined with 6% hydroxyethyl starch has been shown to improve neurologicfunction and cerebral perfusion pressure inpatients with traumatic brain injury. 18a This hypertonic fluid solution is currently used inAustria for resuscitation of all head-injured andmajor trauma patients in the field (Mauritz W ,personal communication). Endpoints of Resuscitation Blood and fluid resuscitation is continued until perfusion has been improved and organfunction has been restored. Manifestations ofimproved cardiac output include improvedmental status; increased pulse deficit;brisk capillary refill; and gen delivery, oxygen consumption, and cen- tral venous or pulmonary artery oxygen satu-ration (Table 2). 19 Blood and Fluid Warmers Fluid and blood resuscitation of the20 Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patienttrauma patient is best accomplished with large- gauge intravenous catheters and effective fluidwarmers with high thermal clearances. 20 Be- cause alterations in red cell integrity are notapparent until 46 oC,21 fluid warmers with set points of 42oC are now commonly used. Coun- tercurrent water and other fluid warmers us-ing 42 oC set points will not damage red cells, will result in consistently warmer fluid deliv-ery, and will allow the clinician to maintainthermal neutrality with respect to fluid man-agement over a wide range of flow rates. 22 Complications of Transfusion Therapy Impaired Oxygen Release from Hemoglobin The ability of the red blood cell to store and release oxygen is impaired after storage.The erythrocytic levels of 2,3-diphosphoglyc-eric acid decrease both with CPD and CPDA-1stored blood. Low levels of 2,3-diphosphoglyc-eric acid will shift the blood's oxygen dissocia-tion curve to the left, and the red cell will havea higher affinity for oxygen at physiologic PO 2 and will release less oxygen at a given tissuePO 2.23 Impaired oxygen release from hemoglo- bin can be minimized by warming all bloodand by avoiding factors that shift the O 2 disso- ciation curve to the left, e.g., hypothermia. Dilutional Coagulopathy Most coagulation factors are stable in stored whole blood, except factors V and VIII.13 These factors gradually decrease to 15% and50% of normal, respectively, after 21 days ofstorage. However, most centers today usepacked red blood cells and not whole bloodduring massive transfusion. Microvascularbleeding and clinical evidence of coagulopathycan occur in the setting of massive transfusionwith 1 blood volume and are associated withdecreased levels of Factor V , VIII, and fibrino- gen and increased prothrombin times. 14-16 Mi- crovascular bleeding in this case can be treatedappropriately with fresh frozen plasma.Dilutional thrombocytopenia is a cause of hem-orrhagic diathesis after 1.5 to 2.0 blood vol-umes have been transfused. This correspondsto ~15 to 20 units of red cells in an adulttrauma victim. 16 In the author's opinion, the platelet count should be monitored and main-tained at or greater than 75,000 to 100,000/ \u00b5l to achieve adequate surgical hemostasis. It time, activatedpartial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, and fibrin degradation products be monitored be- cause deficiencies may be present due to dilu-tion, preexisting defects, or disseminated in-travascular coagulopathy. 24 Point-of-care test- ing and rapid reporting of coagulation test re-sults should be used to guide decisions regard-ing administration of fresh frozen plasma,platelets, or cryoprecipitate. Hypothermia The adverse effects of hypothermia in the trauma patient include major coagulation de-rangements, peripheral meta-bolic impairedimmune 25-27 Standard coagulation tests are temperature corrected to not reflect hypothermia-inducedcoagulopathy. 28-30 Hypothermia impairs coagu- because and reduced platelet function. Hypothermiacan cause cardiac dysrhythmias and even car-diac arrest due to electromechanical dissocia-tion, standstill, or fibrillation, especially withcore temperatures below 30 oC. Hypothermia also increases intracellu- lar potassium a leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.A mortality of 100% has been reported intrauma patients whose body temperature fellbelow 32 oC, regardless of severity of injury, degree of hypotension, or fluid replacement.31 The importance of fluid warming cannot be underestimated in the trauma patient. Itrequires 16 kCal of energy to raise the tem- perature of 1 liter of crystalloid infused at 21 oC to body temperature and 30 kCal to raise thetemperature of cold 4 oC blood to 37oC. Infu- sion of 4.3 liters of crystalloid at room tem-perature to an anesthetized adult trauma pa-tient who cannot increase heat production canresult in a decrease of 1.5 oC in core tempera- ture. Similarly, infusion of 2.3 liters of red cellscould result in a core temperature decrease ofbetween 1 and 1.5 oC.32,33 Since the thermal stress of infusing fluids at normothermia isessentially zero, it follows that use of fluid- warming devices effective at delivering normo- thermic fluids to the patient at clinically rel-evant flow rates permits more efficient rewarm-ing of hypothermic trauma patients using othermethods such as the patient's own metaboli-cally generated heat, or externally providedheat such as convective warming. 22 Citrate Intoxication, Hyperkalemia, and Acid-Base Abnormalities Blood is stored in adenine or adsol at in- is caused by acutely decreased se-rum levels of ionized calcium, which occursbecause citrate binds calcium. 34 Administration of calcium is warranted during massive trans-fusion if the patient is hypotensive and mea-sured serum ionized serum calcium is low or large amounts of blood are infused rapidly (50 to 100 ml/min). Ionized serum calcium levelswill usually return to normal when hemody-namic status is improved. The potassium levelin stored blood rises with length of storage andcan be as high as 78 mmol/L after 35 days. Thepotential for clinically important hyperkalemiastill exists in patients receiving blood adminis-tered at rates >120 ml/min 35 and in patients with severe acidosis. Monitoring the ECG for signs of hyperkalemia is always warranted, andtreatment of hyperkalemia with calcium chlo-ride, bicarbonate, glucose, and insulin may belife saving. The pH of bank blood decreases to about 6.9 after 21 days of storage because of accu-mulation of CO 2, lactic acid, and pyruvic acid by red blood cell metabolism. Thus, the aci-dosis seen in stored blood is partly respiratory and partly metabolic. The respiratory compo- nent is of little consequence with adequatepatient ventilation. The metabolic componentis not usually clinically significant. It is unwiseto administer sodium bicarbonate on an em-piric basis, because there is already a pool ofbicarbonate generated from the metabolism ofcitrate, which is present in large quantities instored blood. Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions Immediate reactions occur from errors involving ABO incompatibility. More than halfof these errors happen after the blood has beenissued by the blood bank, which highlights theimportance of verifying and identifying eachand every donor unit for recipient compatibil-ity. Intravascular hemolysis occurs when recipi- ent antibody coats and immediately destroys the transfused red cells. Classic signs ofhemolytic transfusion reaction are masked bygeneral anesthesia. The only evidence may behemoglobinuria, hypotension, and a bleedingdiathesis. Treatment is supportive and involvesTable 2.

Microaggregates Microaggregates begin forming after ap- proximately 2 days of blood storage. During the first 7 days, microaggregates are mostly platelets or platelet debris. After the first week,the larger fibrin-white blood cell-platelet ag-gregates begin to accumulate. 36 Whether these microaggregates contribute to lung dysfunc-tion during blood transfusion and whetherthey need to be removed by micropore filtersis controversial. Infection Hepatitis C accounts for more than 90% of posttransfusion hepatitis. Every year, at least2,600 patients develop cirrhosis as a result ofhepatitis after blood transfusions. 37 Each unit of fresh frozen plasma or platelets has the samerisk of infection as a unit of packed red cells.Recent estimates of infectious rates per unittransfused include hepatitis C, 1:103,000; hepatitis B, 1:63,000; HIV , 1:493,000; and HTLV I or II, New screening tests using nucleic acid/genomic amplification techniqueswill shorten the window period and reducethe risk for these viruses even further. The riskper unit for Yersinia , malaria, babesiosis, and Chagas is estimated at <1:1,000,000. Othertypes of infectious diseases such as toxoplas-mosis and cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and bacterial infections may also be transmit- ted via transfused blood and blood products.The risk of bacterial contamination per unit ofrandom donor platelets is 1:2,500. Transfusion-Induced Immunosuppression (See also Chapters 8 and 9) Blood transfusion therapy is also associ- ated with allosensitization, immunosuppres-sion, and an increased incidence of postop- erative infections. 39 These effects may be me- diated by reduced lymphocyte function, down-regulation of macrophage function, and alteredcytokin production and activity. Strategies toreduce the risk of immunomodulation includethe use of third-generation leukocyte filters,lower transfusion trigger, red cell salvage, andblood substitutes (Table 3). 11,40-42 It is antici- pated that new devices for autotransfusion, together with the introduction of hemoglobin- based red cell substitutes, will dramatically al-ter the current approach to fluid and bloodcomponent therapy in trauma. Summary The bleeding trauma patient requires rapid evaluation and treatment to ensure ad-equate tissue perfusion and successful out- come. Resources such as thermally efficient fluid warmers, effective transfusion services,and rapid availability of coagulation tests arepractical aspects of trauma resuscitation thatdeserve priority. Preventing hypothermia andrecognizing other complications of massivetransfusion, as well as following trends in vital signs, urinary output, central venous pressures,and arterial and central venous blood gas analy-sis, are of vital importance to managing pa-tients with hemorrhagic shock.

David Do, FCCM, FCCPAssociate Professor of Anesthesia and SurgeryAssociate Director of Surgical Intensive CareUniversity of Cincinnati Medical Center Cincinnati, Ohio, USA The administration of blood and its com- ponents can be life-saving, particularly dur-ing resuscitation in trauma patients whenblood loss can be severe enough to result incellular hypoxia. 1 Also, during other critical illness such as systemic inflammatory re-sponse syndrome, especially if the patient is septic with significant acute lung injury , blood is administered to augment oxygen deliveryto avoid cellular hypoxia and lactate produc-tion. 2 Even though there are risks following blood transfusions, the benefits appear to beinsurmountable 3 (Table 1). In spite of this, the risks of infection, especially from HIV , havetaken center stage even in the lay press. Thus,the immunologic effects of transfusion have not gained the attention deserved.

T-Cell Recognition and Activation T-cell recognition of an antigen with T-cell activation is key in the initiation of rejection and/or tolerance of foreign tissue. Typically, T cells require two signals for activation. The firstoccurs when an antigen is processed into pep-tides by an antigen-presenting cell (APC) andloaded into the groove of a major histocom-patibility complex (MHC) molecule. The anti-gen is then presented to the T cell, which isrecognized in the context of self-MHC (Fig. 1).The second signal occurs when the T cell re- ceives stimulation by a cytokine or by the in- teraction of the T cell with surface moleculesof an APC. Numerous cytokines (interleukins,alpha-tumor necrosis factor, and interferon)are involved in this process as well as cell sur-face receptors, adhesion molecules, and lym-phocyte functioning antigen. 4-6 Other signifi- cant cell surface molecules are the CD3 com-plex and CD45. The former is associated noncovalently with the T-cell receptor on ma- ture T cells and is a target for OKT3, whereasthe latter does not have a known ligand andallows continued activation of the T cell. 7 Generally, T cells recognize antigens pre- sented as short peptides that are bound in theMHC groove. Allo-MHC molecules stimulate agreater response (in vitro mixed lymphocytesresponse and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte assay) than antigens that are not foreign. 8-10 The path- ways for these alloreactivities are both indirectand direct. 11-13 In the direct pathway of alloan- tigen presentation, the T cells recognize intactdonor MHC molecules on the surface of thedonor APC. This pathway may be responsiblefor early acute rejection of grafts. 12 Early in the care of these patients, radiation and other im-mune modulation strategies were used to af-fect this pathway directly by removing or de- stroying these graft leukocytes. 13 The exact mechanism is not known and is, without adoubt, multifactorial. In the indirect pathway,T cells recognize processed donor allo-MHCbound to and presented in the context of self-MHC molecules on the surface of self-APC. Thispathway is normally associated with a nomi-nal antigen. History of Donor-Specific Transfusion As early as 1953, Billingham and associ- ates demonstrated white blood cells as im-mune modulators when neonatal mice of onestrain injected with blood from another sub-sequently accepted skin grafts from the immu-nizing strain. This effect was long term only inthe neonatal mice, not in the adults. 14 The first solid organ transplantation (kidney) was per- formed in 1954 between monozygotic twins. The success was probably related to matchingof the ABO blood type with compatibility ofthe (MHC) antigens, not from immune sup-pression. (The complexity of the immune sys-tem was not well understood during this era.)However, successful transplantation of kidneys from HLA-mismatched donors was not possible(1963) until the advent of immunosuppressiveagents, prednisone and azathioprine. 15,16 The immunosuppressive agents had to be contin- ued to ensure \"acceptance\" of the foreign tis-sue or organ. In addition, early in transplanta-tion, efforts were directed to minimize expo-sure to or sensitization from transfusions.However, in 1972 two animal studies chal-lenged that premise. Jenkins et al revealed thattransfusions administered prior to cardiac al-lografting improved survival of transplantedhearts in rats. 17 Separately, Fabre and associ- ates showed that rejection of the transplanted kidney in rats can be diminished bypretransplant transfusions. 18 Possibly realizing these attributes, Newton and Anderson, in 1973, attempted to manipu-late the immune response to renal allograftsof four patients with donor-specific peripherallymphocyte buffy-coat transfusion from theirpotential living related donor over an extended time (22 to 66 days). Allosensitization did not ensue. Critics believed that the addition of aza-thioprine contributed to the allograft's successrather than the administration of blood. 19 Sub- sequent to this new era of cadaveric donorrenal transplantation and at the same time, Opelz et al, following the success in animalmodels, provided evidence (by reviewing trans-plant data from multiple centers) in humansthat blood transfusion prior to renal transplan- tation improved renal allograft survival. Com- pared with patients who did not receive bloodtransfusions, the transfused patients (>5 trans-fusions) had a higher survival rate of the renalallografts, approaching 20%. Interestinglythough in this study, this effect appeared tohave a dose-response relationship. 18,20,21 Even though this seminal publication was retrospec-tive, recently there appears to be more directevidence for this response. 22 In 1979, Cochrum and colleagues used pretransplantation-di- rected donor-specific whole blood in patientswith renal failure. In strong mixed lymphocyteculture-responsive, one haplotype-mis-matched, and living-related donor transplants,directed transfusions improved survival up to90%. This rate is not that different from that inHLA-identical siblings. 23,24 Following this suc- cess, there was equivalent survival in patients with two haplotype-mismatched, related and unrelated donor-recipient combinations.25,27 From these studies and others, the presenceof leukocytes and one shared HLA-DR antigenwithin the transfusions are sufficient enoughfor optimal immunosuppression. 20,28 Overall, there is sufficient evidence documenting thattransfusions prior to solid organ transplanta-tion improves survival and reduces the inci- dence of rejection. Although the precise mechanisms in- volved in tolerance and sensitization are notcompletely understood, the laboratory findingshave been consistent 29 (Table 2). Generally, blood transfusions induce predictable immuneresponses stimulating alloantibody productionwhen exposed to red cell, white cell, and plate-let alloantigens. 30-33 Investigations have shown lymphocyte activation, lymphocyte sub-population changes, and regulation ofAPC after transfusion 34 (Table 3). These resultsTable 2.

Neonates who received washed and irradiated bloodfailed to exhibit similar effects seen in adultrecipients. 35 Tumor Recurrence There appears to be a beneficial effect of blood transfusions on the immune systems insolid-organ transplantation, but there is a down side\u2014the reemergence of cancer cells in patients with neoplastic disease. However,the results are divergent, ranging from stimu-lation of tumor growth, suppression of growth,and varied to no response to the tumor cells.In 1982, Burrows and colleagues retrospec-tively reviewed 122 patients followingcolorectal surgery. They found a shorter dis-ease-free interval (6 to 12 months) in patents who received a transfusion. 36 A similar investi- gation detected contrasting results and re-vealed that 43% of transfused patients devel-oped recurrent disease or died, compared with9% who did not receive a transfusion. 37 How- ever, a large multicenter, randomized, con-trolled study of colorectal patients (n=475)with cancer found no direct relationship be-tween allogeneic transfusion and prognosis (cancer-free survival rates after 4 years were no different between the two groups), but thedata did suggest an increased in recurrenceno matter if the blood was allogeneic or au-tologous 38 (Table 4). These studies did not fil- ter the white cells from the blood components.In an investigation that did filter, the resultswere confusing because a number of patientsreceived both types of blood products. This study did not reach any conclusions. 39 Unfor- tunately, retrospective studies have inherentflaws and conflicting conclusions. These resultsshould be reviewed skeptically. To counteract or attempt to explain the association with tu-mor recurrence and blood, a meta-analysis wasperformed, reviewing retrospective studies ofcolorectal cancer patients. In this statisticalreview, this association was not confirmed. 40 This study was in contradistinction to anothermeta-analysis review, in which there was ahigher recurrence rate in patients withcolorectal and head and neck cancer. 30 In a prospective, nonrandomized study, 315 consecutive patients with prostatic cancerwho underwent radical retropubic prostatec-tomy were analyzed. Group 1 received at leastone unit of allogeneic blood with or without autologous blood; group 2 received autolo- gous blood only or no blood. These patientsreceived no adjuvant hormonal therapy or ra-diotherapy. The incidence of reoccurrence wassimilar: 25% vs. 23%, respectively. In addition,mortality was not affected by the administra-tion of blood. 41 In patients with high-grade soft-tissue sar- comas of the extremities and osteosarcomas of long bones, there is a suggestion that trans- fusion can alter outcome.42-44 In Rosenberg's study of patients with soft-tissue tumors whounderwent various prospective, randomizedtreatment protocols, the patients without anytransfusions had a 70% actuarial 5-year disease-free survival rate while patients who received1 to 3 units of blood had a 48% rate. The over-all 5-year survival rates were 85% and 63%, respectively. As expected, tumor size correlated inversely with outcome, but after this was takeninto consideration, the effect of transfusion stillwas a negative prognostic indicator. 42 In a re- lated study that focused primarily on thecardiotoxicity of doxorubicin in metastases includedblood transfusion within 24 hours, tumors >5cm, tumors extending into the deep fascia, and other histologic subtypes. 43 Similar correlation was seen between survival and transfusions inpatients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma oflong bones. In this retrospective study, thesurvival rate was 34% with blood and 53% with- out blood. An apparent criticism (not minimiz-ing a retrospective analysis) was that 61% ofthe transfused patients had femoral tumorswhile the nontransfused group included only50%. 44 In animal studies of tumor augmentation, the data are provocative but still suggestive oftransfusions as a factor. One important issueaddressed in these animal models is the re-moval of leukocytes and its timing. In athymicmice transfused with either allogeneic or syn-geneic blood or saline prior to tumor cell in-fusion, the subsequent tumor size was of equaldimensions. However, in immunocompetent mice, there were larger and heavier tumors after transfusion with allogeneic blood. 45 Cor- respondingly, rats transfused with allogeneicor syngeneic blood stored for 1 day had higherrates of tumor growth and shorter survivaltimes than controls with saline infusion. 46 Con- trary to these studies, Shirwadkar et al gavemice various doses of tumor cells with thetransfusions and concluded that the immunomodulatory effect of transfusion is solely dependent on the dose of the inoculatedcells. 47 In addressing the issue of leukocyte deple- tion, Blajchman and colleagues preempted 10days before the infusion of tumors cells eitherleukocyte-reduced or nonleukocyte-reducedblood. The pulmonary metastatic nodules wereassessed 3 weeks later. The recipients of allo- geneic transfusion had two- to five-fold in- creases in these nodules compared with theanimals receiving either leukocyte-reduced al-logeneic or syngeneic blood. 48 In an acute ex- periment (tumor cells injected within 60 to 90minutes of transfusion), pulmonary metastaticnodules were greater (four- to seven-fold) inthe group with allogeneic blood. In this inves-tigation, the authors believed that the removalof allogeneic leukocytes ameliorated the tumor growth potential. 48 Consequently, these same investigators found that removal of leukocytesfollowing storage did not have similar extentof amelioration. 49Table 3.

In reviewing the data in Heiss's series, the postoperative infection rate was higher in the allogeneic group (27%) compared with theautologous group (12%). Multivariant regres-sion analysis revealed that infection was relatedto transfusion, with an odds ratio of 2.84. Seg-menting the groups revealed that the infectionrate also increased with a greater certainty withallogeneic blood compared with the autolo-gous group. 50 In a large prospective study of colorectal patients (n=871), patients were ran- domly assigned either leukocyte-filtered blood(<0.2 x 10 9 leukocytes) or blood without a buffy coat (0.8 x 109 leukocytes per unit). At 3- year follow-up, there was no statistical differ-ence in the infection rate. It is interesting tonote that in this study a certain number (>3)of transfusions was a marker or independentrisk factor for survival as well, similar to tumor location or size. This correlated with the inci- dence of infection in the curative surgery pa-tients. 51 Even though statistical analysis se- lected certain factors, such as >3 units of blood(which had greater postoperative morbidityand mortality), was this associated with themore complex patient with extensive diseaseand technically difficult surgery? Infection Similar controversy surrounds the associa- tion between blood transfused and the inci-dence of postoperative infection. Animal mod-els suggest that allogeneic transfusion in-creases the appearance of infection. 52 In trau- matic burn or induced peritonitis experimen-tal models, animals had shorter survival withallogeneic transfusions than the groups receiv-ing either crystalloid or syngeneic blood. 30,31,33 Interestingly, contrasting this traumatic model,Brunson did not induce injury and only in-fused blood. They found that the addition oftrauma, not the dose of blood, altered the im-mune system, suggesting trauma alone ablatedthe immune response toward infection. 53 To challenge this premise, Gianotti et al subjectedmice to burn injury and infused Escherichia coli. They found that enhanced gut permeabil- ity and bacterial challenge responded syner-gistically in secondary infection. 54 A follow-up investigation showed an association betweenallogeneic leukocytes and an adverse effect on host bacterial mechanisms. 55 Clinically, the results are more confusing. A retrospective analysis of orthopedic patientsrevealed that allogeneic transfusions are asso-ciated with increased frequency of postopera-tive infections, including pneumonia and uri-nary tract infection. 56 Other reports (one ret- rospective and one prospective) showed anassociation. 57,58 In a study of patients under- going total hip replacement, Murphy and as- sociates found a proven or suspected infectionin 32% of their select group, e.g., patients with-out prior infections, malignancy, and infusionof <3 units of blood with allogeneic infusions.This is in comparison to 3% of patients givenautologous blood. The hospital stay was con-siderably longer in patients with suspected in-fection. 57 In a nonrandomized, prospective trial, Triulzi and colleagues detected infection in 20.8% of the allogeneic blood recipients com-pared with 4% of the nontransfused individu-als. Apparently, the amount of units given cor-related with the infection rate. 58 In another ret- rospective review in patients undergoing eitherhip, spinal, or knee surgery, the data betweenthe groups were not conclusive. 59 Howard and Vamvakas corroborated these inconclusive find- ings.60,61 In a different population (cardiac sur- gery patients), the results are more revealing. Amultivariate analysis demonstrated contributingfactors for postoperative infection asreoperation, blood transfusions, early chestreexploration, and sternal rewiring. The diffi-culty with this statistical review is that one wouldexpect the infection rate to be higher in emer-gency reoperations. Controlling clinical factorswould be almost impossible. 62,63 Conclusions The weight of scientific evidence from both basic science and clinical studies sug-gests that allogeneic transfusions have a sig-nificant but varied effect on the immune sys-tem. There is no doubt there is dynamicimmunomodulatory effect on the recipient. The leukocytes appear to be the culprit. Thereason why removing white cells prior to stor-age to minimizes complications (infections,recurrence of tumor) is not understood. Onething certain is that the extent of transfusions correlates with these secondary problems, but in patients who receive a greater number ofblood products, what is the predominant in-determinate factor: the underlying diseaseprocess, the patient's co-morbidity factors, orthe aggressiveness of surgical eradication? No large clinical trials of transfusion in trauma patients (who tend to be young andnot have complicating medical diseases) have been undertaken to determine the incidence of infection when leukocytes are removed priorto storage. In the author's opinion, one groupwill benefit, and that group includes patientstransfused with <10 units of blood. However,this investigation must be initiated upon ar-rival to the definitive area and it must beblinded and prospective. Should the standardof blood banking include prestorage filtering of all blood? Economically, it would be feasible to filter the blood when the potential risk ofinfection and cancer is there. The precedentfor accepting increased cost without clearlydemonstrated benefit has already been set bythe much greater costs involved in the preven-tion of transmission of the AIDS virus by p24antigen testing in blood banking 64 (Table 5).

Rosenberg, MD Department of AnesthesiologyHospital for Joint Diseases/Orthopaedic InstituteNew York, New York, USA The trauma patient frequently requires multiple blood transfusions during resuscita-tion to achieve a stable hemodynamic state. Adequate oxygen-carrying capacity necessitates transfusion based on the patient's pathophysi-ology after being injured, the patient's baselinemedical condition, and actual and anticipatedblood loss. Transfusion is often necessary, but it is not always benign. To even consider the conceptof decreasing the amount of blood transfusedto trauma patients, we must determine whether we can accomplish this goal without affecting outcome. Obviously, many patientswould die without transfusion. Although bloodtransfusions increase oxygen-carrying capacity,massive transfusion is associated with physi-ologic alterations, immunomodulation, andpostoperative infection. Two questions havebecome important in transfusion medicine: 1)What is in the blood? and 2) What are the sys- temic effects of transfusion other than increas- ing the hematocrit? Despite safeguards and tests to ensure that blood is not contaminated, blood is being re-leased that is in fact contaminated. Transfusionof tainted blood can transmit the human im-munodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, cytome-galovirus (CMV) and syphilis. Testing for HIVhas become increasingly accurate, so the win- dow period for possible infection has been shortened because of earlier dectection. Thewindow period for HIV is that time in which aperson is infected with the virus but has notyet demonstrated infectivity by available test-ing methods. In a study conducted a numberof years ago, 39 patients became seropositive Blood Transfusionsfrom 182 \"seronegative\" donors. This resultedfrom the long period necessary to develop de-tectable levels of antibodies to HIV . Currentantibody testing has diminished the window to22 days. In March 1996, the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration mandated P24 antigen testing,which decreased the window period to 16 days. In addition to HIV transmission, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and CMV can be transmitted easily if blood is not tested adequately. CMV is frequently present in transfused blood, itsprevalence determined by geographic location.Special care must be taken in the immunosup-pressed patient to ensure that CMV is notpresent in transfused blood. Bacterial and para-sitic infections can also be transmitted. Othercomplications known to occur with transfu-sions include allergic reactions, hemolytic transfusion reactions, and volume overload. Transfusions may also result in immuno- suppression or immunomodulation of the re-cipient. Studies have demonstrated that renaltransplant patients had improved allograft sur-vival times and lower allograft rejection rates ifthey received transfusions of bank blood (allo-geneic blood) prior to receiving their allograft. 1 During the 1970s, some protocols required patients receiving cadaveric renal transplants to receive transfusions prior to the transplant pro-cedure. Transfusion of whole blood was a stron-ger enhancer of allograft survival than packedred blood cells. The prevalent thought was thattransfusion induced an immunosuppressiveeffect in the patient and thus, after the patientreceived the transplant, rejection did not oc-cur. Fortunately, the need for preoperative al- logeneic transfusion has been mitigated by the introduction of cyclosporin. 2 In addition to evidence that allogeneic transfusions result in immunosuppression,there is evidence that cancer patients who re-ceive these transfusions at the time of surgeryhave lower survival rates and an increased in-cidence of recurrence. 2 Meta-analysis has dem- onstrated this finding to be true in patientswith colorectal cancer and head and neck can- cer.3 Osteosarcoma patients who receive perioperative blood transfusions have an in-creased incidence of metastases and shortersurvival time. 2 An altered immunologic state results from receiving a blood transfusion. Allogeneic bloodtransfusions have been associated with de-creases in cell-mediated immunity, macroph- age migration, and natural killer cell activity. Additionally, allogeneic transfusion affects thecells that incite B-lymphocytes to differentiateand produce antibodies. These immunosup-pressive effects are thought to be the result ofeither antigen excess, a graph-versus-host phe-nomenon, reactivation of immunosuppressiveviruses, or the white blood cells that aretransfuseed along with red blood cells. 2 Allogeneic blood transfusions have also been implicated in postoperative infections.Independently, Murphy and Triulzi, in sepa-rate studies on orthopaedic patients, demon-strated the effect of allogeneic blood transfu-sions in producing postoperative infection. 4,5 A significant increase in postoperative infec-tion rates occurred in patients who receivedallogeneic blood transfusions during either total hip or spine surgery compared with pa- tients who did not receive allogeneic blood.Of patients who received allogeneic transfu-sions, there was an infection rate of 20.8% in astudy of 102 patients undergoing 109 spinalfusions. The infection rate was only 3.5% inthose who did not receive allogeneic blood.Natural killer cell activity, an indicator of im-munologic function, decreased in the patients who received allogeneic transfusion. A specific dose-response curve demonstrated that pa-tients who received two transfusions had ahigher infection rate than patients who re-ceived either one or no transfusion at all. 4,5 Fernandez demonstrated that patients whoreceived homologous whole blood had ahigher incidence (20%) of infection comparedwith the overall (6.1%) infection rate for all928 Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patientpatients in the study.6 Some orthopaedic stud- ies do not demonstrate an association betweenallogeneic transfusion and infection. In a meta-analysis, Vamvakkas et al were unable to dem-onstrate a clear relationship between transfu-sion and infection. Their study criteria, how- ever, defined a significant relationship occur- ring between transfusion and infection as onethat would result in an infection rate more thandouble the baseline occurrence rate. 3 There is significant evidence that transfu- sions are associated with immunomodulationand increased infection in trauma patients. 7-11 Rosemurgy demonstrated an increased inci-dence in postoperative infection in a popula- tion of 390 uncrossmatched trauma patients who received type O blood. In the 61% of pa-tients who survived at least 7 days, the infec-tion rate was higher in those who receivedseven or more units of packed red blood cells. 7 Dellinger noted that, while wound infectionsafter open fractures of the arm or leg were af-fected by local factors, nosocomial infectionswere related to Injury Severity Score (ISS), the incidence of blood transfusion, patient age, and the mode of injury. Edna and Bjerkeset,in a Norwegian study of 484 trauma patientswho survived longer than 2 days, demonstrateda 9.5% infection rate, with a univariate rela-tionship between infection and transfusion. 10 This relationship was independent of ISS, age,and surgical procedure. The risk of infectionafter colon injury is associated with blood transfusion, age, and the number of associated injuries and splenic injury. Agarwal, in a studyof 5,366 consecutive trauma patients,documentrf that blood transfusion was a pre-dictor of infection after controlling for patient'sage, sex, mechanism, or severity of injury. 11 In a study of 619 geriatric patients with hip fracture, a study at the author's institutiondocumented a significantly higher incidenceof urinary tract infections in patients who re- ceived allogeneic transfusion compared with those who did not require any transfusion. 12 Riska demonstrated a linear relationship between the number of units transfused andmortality, with 21 to 39 units being associ-ated with a 25% mortality and more than 40units associated with a 52% mortality. 13 Wudel documented 5 survivors of more than 50 unitsof blood after massive transfusion. 9 Blunt and penetrating trauma patients receiving mul- tiple transfusions had similar survival rates(59%). Shock, closed head injury, and agepredicted increased mortality but did not pre-clude survival. Massive transfusion may be associated with high citrate and acid load, possible he-mostatic failure, disseminated intravascularcoagulation, large amounts of infused blood debris, inadequate 2,3-DPG levels, and throm- bocytopenia. Thus, although multiple transfu-sion is indicated under many conditions, weneed to consider what are appropriate trans-fusion triggers. What factors are consideredimportant in determining the need for trans-fusion? In order to tolerate low hemoglobin, patients must be able to compensate for thedecreased oxygen-carrying capacity associatedwith decreased concentrations of red bloodcells. Healthy patients can frequently compen-sate, but this ability becomes compromised with age and cardiac and respiratory disease. Increases in cardiac output must be sufficientto overcome existing deficits. Since oxygendelivery depends on cardiac output and arte-rial oxygen concentration, in addition to sup-plying enhanced oxygen concentration, thepatient must be able to increase stroke volumeand heart rate. The trauma patient is faced withacute decreases in hemoglobin levels and not afforded the ability to compensate, as do pa- tients with chronic anemia. Once volume sta-tus is repleted, hemoglobin (Hb) levels mustbe evaluated to determine the need for trans-fusion. Most patients require transfusion whenthe Hb is less than 6 gm/dl and few require itwhen the Hb is more than 10 gm/dl. Transfu-sion in the intermediate area requires consid-eration of physiologic status and the individual's ability to ensure adequate oxygen- ation to vital organs. Conclusion Many trauma patients require blood trans- fusions to replenish massive blood loss fromwounds. The advantages of predonation andcell salvage techniques are not present underemergency conditions or are inappropriate based on the type of injury. Currently, this leaves banked blood as the source of blood for trans-fusion. The advantages afforded by administer-ing allogeneic blood to enhance oxygen-carry-ing capacity must be weighed against its adverseside effects, which include immunomodulation,transmission of infectious diseases, and thepossibility of a transfusion reaction.

Maureen Nash Sweeney, MDAttending AnesthesiologistAnesthesiology DepartmentDepartment of Veterans Affairs Medical CenterNew York, New York, USA Vascular access in the trauma patient is essential for three reasons: administration of intravenous fluids administration of drugs measurement and monitoring of cardiac parameters Vascular Access in Trauma: Options, Risks, Benefits, Complications In the trauma patient presenting with multiple serious injuries and hemorrhagicshock, vascular access is necessary to restorecirculatory volume rapidly. The urgency of theplacement and the size and number of intra-venous (IV) lines is dictated by the degree ofshock, the apparent rate of bleeding, and the type of injury. Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol recommends proceedingwith attempts at percutaneous peripheral ac-cess, followed by a surgical venous cutdownbefore resorting to central venous access. Therationale is that, in a hypovolemic patient, the10Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patient 29likelihood of success with a venous cutdown is greater than with a central line. Addition-ally, the rate of complications (e.g., pneu-mothorax and arterial puncture) is higher withcentral IV access. 1 However, the most impor- tant factor in considering the procedure and route for vascular access is the individual physician's level of skill and expertise. Location of the injury must be considered when choosing a site for venous access. Venousaccess must never be initiated in an injured limb.In patients with injuries below the diaphragm,at least one IV line should be placed in a tribu-tary of the superior vena cava, as there may bevascular disruption of the inferior vena cava. Patients with upper thoracic and neck injuries should have large-bore access in the lower ex-tremity, as there may be superior vena cava dis-ruption. In with severe multitrauma inwhom occult thoracoabdominal damage is sus-pected, it is recommended to have one IV ac-cess site above the diaphragm and one belowthe diaphragm, thus cava, respec- of large amounts of intravenous fluids, short large-bore cathetersshould be used. Based on Poiseulle's law, therate of fluid flow is inversely proportional tothe length of the catheter and directly propor-tional to its internal diameter: r 4(P) 8nL where Q=flow, r=radius of the catheter, P=driving pressure through the catheter (grav-ity or externally applied), n=viscosity of thesolution, and L=length of IV tubing. Doublingthe internal diameter of the venous cannula increases the flow through the catheter 16-fold. A 14-gauge, 5-cm catheter in a peripheral veinwill pass fluid twice as fast as a 16-gauge, 20-cm catheter passed centrally. Although resis-tance to flow is added by multiple stopcocksand connections, stopcocks are recommendedfor universal precautions. When using 8.5French pulmonary catheter introducers, theside port should be removed, as this increases the resistance roughly four-fold. For subcla- vian, internal jugular, femoral, and antecubitallines, used. 4 Percutaneous Intravenous Insertion ATLS guidelines recommend rapid placement of two large-bore (16-gauge orlarger) IV catheters in the patient with seriousinjuries and hemorrhagic shock. The first choice for IV insertion should be a peripheral extremity vein. The most suitable veins are atthe wrist, the dorsum of the hand, the antecu-bital fossa in the arm, and the saphenous inthe leg. These sites can be followed by the ex-ternal jugular and femoral vein. The complication rate of properly placed intravenous catheters is low. Intravascularplacement of a large-bore IV should be veri- fied by checking for backflow. An IV site shouldinfuse easily without added pressure. Intrave-nous fluids can extravasate into soft tissueswhen pumped under pressure through an in-filtrated IV line, and a compartment syndrome can result. It is always best to have intravenous sites out where they can be examined. Central Venous Access Rapid peripheral percutaneous IV access may be difficult to achieve in patients with hy-povolemia and venous collapse, edema, obe-sity, scar tissue, history of IV drug abuse, orburns. Under such circumstances, central ac- cess with wide-bore catheters can be advanta- geous. An additional benefit is the ability tomonitor central venous pressure. However,subclavian and internal jugular catheterizationshould not be used routinely in trauma pa-tients, as the complications can be dangerous. Subclavian Catheterization Subclavian catheterization provides rapid and safe venous access in experienced hands. The most frequent complication of subclavianvenipuncture is pneumothorax. Pneumotho-rax is more likely to occur on the left side be-cause the left pleural dome is anatomicallyhigher. Subclavian and internal jugular cath-eters should be inserted on the side of injuryin patients with chest wounds, reducing thechances of collapse of the uninjured lung. A simple pneumothorax may result in respira- tory compromise in individuals with pulmo-nary contusions or a pneumothorax in the con-tralateral hemithorax. 2 A suspected injury to the subclavian vein is an exception to this principlebecause the infused fluid may extravasate intothe mediastinum or thoracic cavity. A hemothorax may result of the subclavian vein or subclavian artery. Ifthe subclavian catheter is placed inadvertently in the thoracic cavity, subsequent infusions of blood or crystalloids will produce a hemotho-rax or hydrothorax. Catheter placement shouldbe ensured prior to IV infusions, whether byaspiration or by lowering the IV infusion bagbelow the patient and verifying backflow. Thesetests are suggestive of IV placement but noneis diagnostic. 4 When inserting introducers over guide wires, it is important not to force the introducer if resistance is encountered. Forc- ing the introducer could result in perforationof large veins or arteries and bleeding. Venous air embolism is another complica- tion of central line Occlusion shouldbe maintained over the catheter lumen with agloved finger or by increasing the pressure inthe subclavian vein by Trendelenburg positionor Valsalva maneuver. Even with prompt therapy, the fatality rate with significant air em- bolism is high. 5 Embolization of catheter frag- ments can occur when withdrawing a catheterwith a through-the-needle technique. Arrhythmia may occur during line place- ment when the catheter or wire contacts theendocardium of the atrium or ventricle. Proper positioning of the catheter in the superior venacava usually misdirected The subclavian catheter is often malpositionedinto the internal jugular vein. When the cath-eter is placed properly in the SVC, thrombosisusually does not occur because of the highflow and large caliber of the vessel. A kinkedor knotted catheter in the SVC may lead tothrombosis. Injury to the brachial plexus or phrenic nerve may result from attempts to place a sub- clavian line. The nerves are posterior to thevein, and injury occurs when the needle haspenetrated both walls. Left-sided central lineattempts can result in thoracic duct injury. Infectious complications associated with line placement can be prevented by usingproper sterile technique. Any lines placed dur-ing resuscitation of a trauma patient without strict aseptic technique should be removed. Internal Jugular Vein Catheterization Percutaneous placement of internal jugu- lar (IJ) catheters is also an excellent means ofattaining rapid large-bore catheter access. Cer-vical trauma is a contraindication internaljugular placement. Trendelenburg maneuver help to distend the in- ternal jugular vein and improve the rate of success for venipuncture. Carotid artery puncture is a common com- plication of IJ catheter placement. Local directpressure can prevent hematoma formation.Carotid puncture is a contraindication to at-tempting IJ catheter placement on the oppo-site side, because bilateral hemorrhages couldcompress the airway. Other complications from IJ venipuncture are similar to those associated with subclavian venipuncture. The incidence of pneumotho-rax is less with IJ catheter placement than withplacement of a subclavian line. The hemothorax, mediastinal migration of thecatheter, and intrapleural catheter placementtends to be greater with left IJ placement thanright because the left IJ is more circuitous, andadvancement of a catheter can rupture the vessel. Stellate ganglion injury is a possible complication. Femoral and Basilic-Cephalic Central Lines Femoral vein cannulation is another alter- native for line placement and is associated withfewer acute complications. Bowel perforationcan occur, especially in patients with femoral hernia. Penetration of the hip could result in septic arthritis. Thrombophlebitis occurs moreoften with femoral than with IJ or subclaviancatheters; however, this is most likely with pro-longed use. Basilic-cephalic catheterization may beQ =30 Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patientused for central access and central venous pres- sure monitoring with a \"long-arm\" catheter.Introducers can also be inserted safely. Theyare easily placed and associated with a lowcomplication rate. Venous Cutdowns Venous cutdowns can be performed when venous cannulationis desirable, such as in hemodynamic shockand in situations where percutaneous periph-eral or central access is either contraindicatedor impossible to achieve. Most favored sites for cutdowns are the cephalic, basilic, and median antecuital veins in the upper extremity and the greater saphe- nous in the lower. These veins can accept largecatheters, allowing rapid infusion. Strict asep-tic technique should be used. Surgical masksand caps should be worn. 6 Venous cutdown has a low potential for anatomic damage. Cutaneous nerve injury is themost common problem. The infection rate isrelatively low when used acutely but increases precipitously over time. Therefore, it is recom- mended that venous cutdown catheters be re-moved as soon as it is possible to achieve IVaccess through standard percutaneous IV cath-eters or a central venous catheter. 5 Vascular Access in Pediatric Patients Ideally, venous access in severely injured children should be established via a percuta- neous route. Unfortunately, this often proves to be a difficult task. ATLS recommends thatafter two unsuccessful percutaneous attempts,consideration should be given to intraosseousinfusion in children younger than 6 years ofage or direct venous cutdown in children over6 years of age. 1 Scalp veins should not be used when rapid fluid administration may beneeded. Internal jugular and subclavian cath-eterization can be done in children but shouldbe performed only by experienced personnel.In awake children, there is a higher incidence of pneumothorax and arterial puncture. Intraosseous catheters can be used in all age groups but are most successful in thoseyounger than 2 because the cortical bone issofter. Fluids and drugs can be given throughthe catheter. Specially designed intraosseousneedles are available but 18- to 20-gaugeneedles, bone marrow aspiration needles, and18-gauge spinal needles can be used. Eighteen- gauge spinal needles are readily available, but they often bend and make placement difficult.In children younger than 6 years of age, thelocations of choice are the proximal tibia andthe distal femur. When using the proximal needle should be placed 2 to 3cm distal to the level of the tibial tuberosity onthe anterior medial surface of the proximaltibia. In adults, a site 2 cm proximal to the tip of the medial malleoli is selected, with the needle distaltibia, distal femur, sternum, clavicle, andhumerous can also be used. Pressure and arotary motion should be used until there is adecrease in resistance, indicating that the med-ullary cavity has been entered. It is not alwayspossible to aspirate marrow, but IV fluid shouldrun easily without a pump. 7 Complications of intraosseous infusions include extavasation of fluids into surround-ing tissues, osteomyelitis. Mul-tiple attempts at insertion should be avoidedsince the other holes in the bone could allowleakage of fluid into the adjacent soft tissue.The incidence of osteomyelitis is low when catheters are removed early. Standard periph-eral or central venous placement should beattempted when the patient is stable. Boneswith fractures and sites with open woundsshould be avoided. 5 References1.

Importance of Warming IV Fluids Conclusive evidence demonstrating the harmful effects of cold fluid infusion was pro-vided by Boyan and Howland. 14 In their study, infusion of 0.5 L of cold blood reduced coretemperature of anesthetized cancer patients by0.5 to 1.0 oC. When 3.0 L or more of cold blood was administered, esophageal temperature de-creased markedly and was associated with a high incidence of cardiac arrests (12 of 25 patients). 14 When blood was warmed, the incidence of car- diac arrests in a matched group of patients withsimilar surgeries, blood loss, anesthesiologist,and surgeon was only 3 of 105 patients. 15,16 The use of large quantities of unwarmed fluids for immediate resuscitation of patientswith penetrating trauma prior to emergencysurgical intervention has been discouraged. 17 It is possible that the use of unwarmed fluidsmay contribute to a hypothermia-induced or dilutional coagulopathy, although experimen-tal evidence suggests that hydraulic factors mayplay a more important role (e.g., disruption ofsoft clot, decreased resistance to flow arounda partially formed thrombus). 18 Thermal Stress of Infusing Cold or Inad-equately Warmed Fluids and Blood The theoretical impact of infusing fluids on body temperature can be calculated as follows: Change in body temperature =Thermal stress of infused fluids /(Weight x Sp heat) where: Thermal stress = Temperature difference between core and infused fluids x specific heat of infused fluid x volumeof fluid infusedWeight = weight of patient in kgSp heat = specific heat of the patient(0.83 kcal/L/ oC)19,2011Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patient 31According to the specific heat of water, 1 kCal of heat is required to raise the tempera-ture of 1 kg of water by 1 oC. Assuming that 1 L of crystalloid weighs 1 kg and that its specificheat is the same as water, one needs 16 kCalof energy to raise the temperature of 1 liter of crystalloid infused at 21 oC to body tempera- ture (37oC).19-22 Similarly, infusion of 4.3 L of crystalloid at room temperature to an adulttrauma patient would require 71 kCal, theequivalent of 1 hour of heat production in anawake adult, or 1.5 hour of heat productionin an anesthetized adult male (heat produc-tion decreased by 33%). The negative thermal balance of 4.3 L of room temperature fluids is thus equivalent to a decrease of 1 oC body temperature in an awake individual and a 1.5oC temperature de- crease in an anesthetized patient. Conversely,30 kCal are required to raise the temperatureof cold 4 oC blood to 37oC, such that infusion of 2 L could result in a body temperature de-crease of between 1.0 and 1.5 oC.19-22 Temperature Setpoints of Warmers In the United States, blood can be warmed safely so as not to cause hemolysis using a tem-perature setpoint of 42 oC in conjunction with an FDA-cleared blood warming device. Thissetpoint is based on observations by Uhl andcolleagues 23 and is supported by a large body of experience with cardiac perfusion. In thestudy by Uhl et al, 23 red cells were incubated at 37, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, and 50oC for up to 2 hours in a constant-temperature waterbath.Even subtle alterations in red cell integrity suchas increased plasma hemoglobin and osmoticfragility were not apparent until 46 oC.23 There has been renewed interest in deliv- ering very hot fluids in an attempt to transferheat to hypothermic patients. For example,infusion of crystalloid at 54 oC will transfer ~21 kCal/L to a hypothermic patient whose core temperature is 33oC. This technique has been shown to be relatively safe in a series of pa-tients undergoing operative burn debridementand immediate skin grafting. 24 Fluids were in- fused at a rate of 110 ml/hr. In the study, therewas no evidence of intravascular hemolysis orother overt complications such as excessivebleeding or hyperkalemia. 24 There is currently not enough safety information to recommend this technique and there is danger that very hot fluids may result in local vascular damageand other complications such as hemolysis. Fluid Warming Devices (Table 1) Intravenous administration of large vol- umes of inadequately warmed fluid can leadto significant hypothermia. Several methods towarm IV fluids are currently available. These methods include immersing coiled IV tubing in a warm water bath, microwaving the bag offluid to be infused, adding heated saline toblood to be infused, passing the IV tubingthrough a heating block or through a plastictube warmed with forced air, passing the IVTable 1.

The ability of blood warmers to safelydeliver normothermic fluids over a wide rangeof flows is limited by several factors, includinglimited heat-transfer capability of materialssuch as plastic, limited surface area of the heat exchange mechanism, inadequate heat trans-fer of the exchange mechanism at high flow rates, erythrocyte damage, and heat loss after the IV tubing exits the warmer. 25,30-32 For ex- ample, adding warmed saline to blood couldhave catastrophic results unless the saline isnot heated above a certain temperature\u2014themaximum safe temperature would be highlydependent on the relative volume of saline and32 Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patientblood. The dangers of using unproven meth- ods and nonapproved approaches to bloodwarming cannot be overemphasized. The heat-transfer capabilities of warming devices using dry heat exchange technology is limited by use of poorly conducting materials such as plastic and by limited heat transfer sur-face area. Warming devices that utilize counter-current heat exchange (Level 1 H250 [Fig. 1],H1000 [Fig. 2], and FW537) are capable ofwarming even at very rapid flow rates dueto better conduction materials interposed be-tween the heating elements and the infusedfluid. 32,33 Therefore, both these devices are appropriate for situations where rapid (>100 ml/min) volume resuscitation is necessary. At moderate flows (<100 ml/min), there is significant heat loss after the IV tubing exits thewarmer. The continual countercurrent warm-ing of fluids in the tubing (Hotline [Fig. 3] andH1000) essentially eliminates the loss of heatalong the tubing distal to the warmer. 33 Table 2 summarizes the implications of us- ing various fluid warmers during commonly en- countered clinical situations: pressure-driven in-fusion, and gravity-driven infusion with theroller clamp wide open. 32,33 In the first situa- tion, the patient presents with severe circula-tory shock due to massive blood loss. Fluid re-suscitation via large-bore IV cannulas is requiredto prevent acidosis and irreversible shock. Inthe second scenario, the fluid and blood vol- ume deficit is not as severe, although ongoingblood loss may necessitate moderately fast in-fusions with the roller clamp wide open to main-tain normovolemia and hemodynamic stability.It can be seen from the calculations in Table 1that the thermal stress of infusing cold fluidsmay result in considerable changes in meanbody temperature, especially if the patient is unable to increase heat production or prevent further heat loss. The larger the gradient be-tween the temperature of the infused fluid andTable 2.

In theFigure 4. Schematic of the Astotherm warmer. This device consists of IV tubing coiled around a circular heating element (dry heat technology). Figure 3a and b. Hotline warmer. This device consists of a water bath and an L-70 disposable. The L-70 disposable heats fluid within the 254-cm patient line, which consists of a central lumen for the IV fluid surrounded by an outer layer through which warm water circulates down one side and then back up to the warm water reservoir in a countercurrent fashion (countercurrent heat exchange technology). Figure 2a and b. Level 1 H1000 warmer. The device consists of a cylindrical aluminum heat exchanger mounted on the warming unit and heated by a countercurrent water bath, similar to the Level 1 250. After the fluid exits this first heat exchanger, it enters a 254-cm patient line in which heat loss is prevented by surrounding the central lumen with warmed water circulating in a countercurrent direction, similar to the Hotline device. Figure 5. Schematic of the modified cardioplegia heat exchange warmer. The device consists of a water bath that circulates water through a stainless steel cardioplegia heat exchanger in a countercurrent fashion. This device is no longer used at the author's institution because of delays in setup and de-airing and high disposable costs. author's experience, it is wise to have one in-dividual solely responsible for pressurized in-fusion of fluids. This individual must utilizeextreme vigilance and caution because of thedanger of infusing air at these high flow rates.This author is aware of four cases of massiveair embolus at other institutions following use of pressurized infusions. Therefore, it is the author's belief that constant pressurized infu-sion devices not be used unless the patient is in profound hemorrhagic shock, and all air hasbeen removed from the fluid to be infused rap-idly. The automatic air eliminator incorporatedinto the design of the Haemonetic RIS andLevel 1 devices make these units somewhatsafer, but does not eliminate the risks of mas- sive air embolus.34 Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma PatientSummary Adverse metabolism and increased wound infec- tion. Administration of cold or inadequately warmed intravenous fluids contributes to hy-pothermia, whereas administration of normo-thermic fluids may reduce both the incidenceand complications of hypothermia. Therefore, infusion of adequately warmed fluids is impor-tant in order to minimize thermal stress andmaintain thermal homeostasis.

Georges Desjardins, MD, FRCPCAttending AnesthesiologistBoca Raton, Florida, USA Trauma is the most common cause of death in Americans under the age of 45. 1 In the United States, deaths from unintentional injuries aremost often the result of motor vehicle crashes,falls, poisoning, fires, or drowning. Althoughthe number of deaths from motor vehiclecrashes has decreased over the past few years,there has been an alarming increased in fire-arm-related deaths. If this trend continues,deaths from firearms are likely to exceed those from motor vehicle crashes by the year 2003. 1 Trauma anesthesiologists are faced today with sicker patients than in the past because of Management of Massive Hemorrhage and Transfusion in Trauma improvements in emergency prehospital care, initial resuscitation of trauma victims in emer-gency departments, and rapid transport to op-erating rooms. It is not uncommon to care for patients with blunt injuries to the great vessels, penetrating injuries to the heart, severe bluntinjuries to the liver, severe open-book pelvicfractures, and penetrating injuries to the trunkand to then see these patients leave the hospi-tal to lead constructive, functional lives. Hypotension and hypovolemia are gener- ally regarded as detrimental to the brain andother organs and are associated with worse outcome, particularly in association with se- vere head injury. In recent reports, there isspeculation that hypovolemia and associatedhypotension are beneficial in some circum-12Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patient 35stances when hemorrhage is uncontrolled.2,3 The most frequently stated example is a lacer- ated major artery, when the administration offluid and associated increase in blood pressuremight dislodge a clot from the area of injury,increase the hemorrhage, and turn stable hy- potension into lethal recurrent hemorrhage. The evidence for the occurrence of these theo-retic effects from fluid resuscitation is stron-ger for penetrating trauma than for blunttrauma, which is more common in patientswith head injuries. Currently there is generalsupport for fluid administration as a mainstayof initial resuscitation after blunt trauma. Theinitial hemodynamic stabilization is still intra- venous access, correction of hypovolemia, and hemorrhage identification and control. This review focuses on the management of exsanguinating hemorrhage and massivetransfusion from blunt or penetrating traumaafter the patient's arrival in the operating room. Definition Resuscitation of the severely injured patient with fluids and blood products for hemorrhagic shock is often associated with complex meta-bolic alterations. Several definitions for massiveblood transfusions have been proposed. 4,5 These range from the replacement of thepatient's whole blood volume in 24 hours toreplacement of 50% of the volume in 3 hours. When reviewing the physiologic conse- quences of massive transfusion, knowledge of these different definitions would seem essential, as they are quite different. Another definition thatwe would like to submit is the concept of mas- sive massive transfusion , which we define as the replacement of a patient's estimated blood vol-ume in less than 30 or 60 minutes. Certainly, themetabolic abnormalities associated with bloodreplacement and resuscitation in this type of pa-tient should be anticipated to be worse than forpatients who get 20 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in 24 hours. Initial Evaluation After initial evaluation and resuscitation, the trauma victim requiring surgery should be moni-tored during transport and be accompanied bymembers of the trauma team. The basic moni-toring devices for transport include an electro-cardiogram, automated blood pressure device, and pulse oximeter. End-tidal CO 2 monitoring should be considered if the patient is intubated.Ideally, the trauma team leader should transfercare directly to the anesthesiologist involved inthe case. Information accompanying the trans-fer should include mechanism of injury, injuriesthat have been identified, results and omissionsof investigations, medical history, and allergies.Giving this advance notice to the team in the operating room before the actual arrival of the patient will avoid delays and keep the focus oncontinuity and quality of care. 6 After the arrival of an exsanguinating pa- tient in the operating room, the anesthesiolo-gist will have to modify his or her evaluationand induction techniques to set new priori- ties and techniques for the resuscitation. Thismodification is the crash emergency anesthe- sia technique . It is in fact a combination of the ATLS initial evaluation 7 and the regular an- esthesia induction set-up. The first priorities will be evaluating and managing the airway, oxygenation, ventilation, followed by measur-ing the blood pressure; sorting out the intra-venous lines already in place; finding accessfor drug injection; attaching ECG; infusingfluids through blood warmers; getting bloodin the room; checking patient identity andhistory of allergy; placing an arterial catheter;drawing blood for blood gases, hematocrit, other lab tests; titrating an anesthetic, if pos- sible; checking temperature and urine output;inserting a central venous or pulmonary arterycatheter or the TEE probe for monitoringneeds; and finally inserting a gastric tube. The route for fluid administration in trauma is a source of controversy. There is gen-eral consensus that the first choice for cannu-lation is a vein that is visible, which most often means a peripheral vein on the upper extremi- ties. T wo large-bore peripheral intravenouscatheters (16 gauge or larger) should be placedas quickly as possible for the administrationof fluids and blood. Using 14- or 16-gauge 2-inch peripheral catheters should allow a flowrate of 300 ml/min of crystalloid or 150 ml/min of blood when used in combination witha pressure bag. 8 In areas with well-developed emergency medical systems, most trauma vic- tims arrive at the hospital with these intrave-nous catheters already in place. 9 If peripheral intravenous access was un- successful in the field or in the resuscitationroom or if hypotension persists, additionalsites should be considered to ensure immedi-ate intravenous access. Some authors suggest,as a second choice, the cannulation of the ex-ternal jugular vein; as third choice, the use of the femoral vein; and as last choices, venous cutdown and catheterization through the in-ternal jugular or subclavian veins. 9 If the patient does not have adequate in- travenous access, spinal precautions are stillbeing applied (cervical collar, backboard, triple fixation of the cervical spine), and unstable vitalsigns are present, several problems can be an-ticipated. Moving the head and neck or open-ing the cervical collar would be necessary toperform easy and timely cannulation of either the external or the internal jugular vein. Re- moving some of the spinal precautions beforeclinical or radiologic clearance would not beideal and waiting for the radiologic evaluationwould be impractical. In these circumstances,the femoral vein could be an excellent secondchoice for venous access because of its largesize and easy access. However, a major con-cern with the use of the femoral vein as the \"main IV\" in the acute phase of resuscitation is the possibility of vascular injuries from theoriginal trauma in the pelvic and/or the abdomi-nal region, especially in patients with penetrat-ing trauma to the abdomen and in patients whohave sustained major pelvic fractures, in whomassociated vascular injuries are frequent. Rely-ing mainly on femoral access in this situationmight lead to loss of resuscitation fluid into the extravascular space. Use of a venous cutdown in the lower extremities has the same limita-tion. Although a venous cutdown in the upperextremities would avoid this problem, it is tech-nically more difficult and therefore often moretime consuming. When there is inadequate in-travenous access in the severely injured patientwith suspected intra-abdominal injuries, it is ourpractice to use the subclavian vein as our sec- ond choice for fluid administration 6 (Table 1). In situations of advanced hypovolemic shockor exsanguination, where percutaneous tech-niques are unsuccessful, venous cutdown at thesaphenofemoral junction may be used. 10 The use of an 8.5 or 9.0 French introducer allows a flow rate higher than 500 ml/min withthe use of a pressure bag and large-caliber IVtubing. 8,11 Strict aseptic technique should be used even in emergency situations. As a general rule, all intravenous catheters placed in the prehospitalphase and in the resuscitation room should bechanged in the first 24 hours after insertion, be-cause they may have been inserted under less- Table 1.

All intravenous fluids and blood products should be warmed. The H1000 infusion system(Level One Technologies, Inc., Rockland, Mas-sachusetts) is capable of infusing and heating 800 ml/min of crystalloid or 500 ml/min of blood. The Rapid Infusion System (RIS,Haemonetics Corporation, Braintree, Massachu-setts) can infuse blood products (red cells, freshfrozen plasma), crystalloids, or colloids at ratesup to 1,500 ml/min. This system is extremelyuseful in the management of exsanguinatinghemorrhage. The use of blood warming/high-volume infusion systems in addition to warm- ing the resuscitation room or operating room to temperatures at high as 30 \u00b0C is essential if hypothermia is to be prevented effectively dur-ing resuscitation of the trauma patient. Metabolic and Hemostatic Effects of Massive Blood Transfusions Since banked blood undergoes a number of metabolic and structural changes over time, multiple severe derangements of physiology are theoretically possible when large volumesof banked blood are given to critically ill orinjured patients. Although the volume of bloodtransfused may lead to a variety of problems(Table 2), both the depth and duration of shockappear to be more significant determinants ofphysiologic derangements than the transfusionof blood itself. 12 If the patient receiving mas- sive transfusion receives adequate fluid resus- citation and maintains oxygen delivery and organ perfusion, the sequelae of massive trans-fusion may be minimized. The volume of bloodproducts that the patient receives should notbe the primary determinant of therapeuticdecisions or prognosis. 13-15 The ability to provide massive transfusion is a relatively recent medical accomplishmentresulting from a series of advances (large blood banks, rapid infusers of warm fluids, and bet- ter understanding of the physiology of trans-fusion). The varied definitions of massive trans-fusion, the numerous associated clinical con-ditions, and the relative lack of detailed rigor-ous studies have crated controversy in the lit-erature regarding the metabolic effects of mas-sive transfusion. The confusion is com-pounded by the use of blood of varied storage life, nonuniform resuscitation protocols, and comparison of patients suffering from shockof differing severity and duration. The storage and refrigeration of pRBCs results in progressive changes that are termedstorage lesions . 16 The change in deformabilityand increased hemolysis is linked to the de- creased levels of intracellular ATP . This in turnis linked to the increased levels of potassium,ammonia, and hemoglobin in the supernatantplasma or preservative solution. The changein oxygen affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is, in large part, a consequence of decreased levels of intracellular 2,3-DPG. The increase invasoactive substances is a result of their releasefrom leukocytes and platelets contained in theblood or red cell concentrate. Finally, the de-velopment of microaggregates is due to theformation of small amounts of fibrin strandsduring storage and the adherence of senescentplatelets and leukocytes to them. Massive transfusion of blood components containing sodium citrate can lead to transientlydecreased levels of ionized calcium. Hypocal-cemia can cause hypotension, narrowed and biventricular dysfunction. Elec-trocardiographic abnormalities such as pro-longed QT interval can occur. Adults who havenormal hepatic function, are normothermic,and are not in shock can tolerate the infusion of one unit of PRBCs every 5 minutes (20 units/ hr) without developing hypocalcemia. 17 Since stored blood commonly has el- evated potassium concentration, up to 30 to40 mEq/L by 3 weeks of storage, hyperkalemiais possible with massive transfusion. Hyper-kalemia may cause elevated peaked T waveson the electrocardiogram. It can significantlyalter cardiac function, especially if associated with hypocalcemia. The incidence of intraop- erative hyperkalemia increases with infusionrate of PRBCs above Hyperkale-mia can be treated early with intravenous cal-cium, insulin, and bicarbonate and with PRBCwashing before administration. 18 Although stored PRBCs have an acid pH (about 6.3), alkalosis is the usual result of mas-sive transfusion without shock. Sodium citratecontained in the anticoagulant is converted to sodium bicarbonate in the liver. The alkalosis initially increases the oxygen affinity of hemo-globin, resulting in less oxygen off-loading tothe tissues. The clinical significance of this al-kalosis is unknown. Hypothermia may occur with rapid trans- fusion of large volumes of cold blood compo-nents. It remains the most under-recognizedand under-treated cause of coagulopathy in trauma patients. 19 It increases the affinity ofhemoglobin for oxygen and impairs clotting function. Low temperature also increases thepotential for hypocalcemia because of de-creased hepatic metabolism of citrate. Preven-tion of hypothermia is essential and can beachieved by warming intravenous fluids and blood during administration, warming the operating room to 30 \u00b0C, and using convective warming blankets in all cases of severe trauma. As the amount of blood replacement in- creases, the trauma patient's own blood be-gins to take on characteristics of bank blood,with low levels of 2,3-DPG and low activitiesof Factor V and VIII, as well as dilutional throm-bocytopenia. When blood is stored at 4 \u00b0C for 24 to 48 hours, the platelets have only 5% to 10% of normal activity. Following transfusion,these platelets are essentially nonfunctional.The massive transfusion of packed RBCs willrapidly dilute the patient's existing plateletpool. The decrease is often less than expectedon the basis of simple dilution because of somerelease of platelets from the spleen and bonemarrow. Prompt platelet administration should be considered once abnormal bleeding is noted. In the patient who has microvascularbleeding without hypothermia, a platelet countbelow 50,000/ \u00b5l or a count below 100,000/ \u00b5l indicates the need for platelet trans- fusion. Indications for fresh frozen plasma(FFP) and cryoprecipitate are not clear. Intrauma patients who receive between one andtwo blood volume replacement, dilutional thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen levels below 75 mg/dl often occur. 20 Low levels of coagula- tion Factors V and VIII are usually a clinicalproblem after two blood volume replacement.Fibrinogen can be replaced with FFP or cryo-precipitate. In trauma patients, low coagula-tion factors are usually replaced with FFP . In addition to the metabolic changes ob- served with massive transfusion, infectious andimmunologic effects can complicate the care of trauma patients. Viral hepatitis remains the major infectious risk of transfusion. With bet-ter donor blood screening in the United States,the estimated risks (per unit of blood trans-fused) of transmission of viral infection are asfollows 21: HIV , 1:493,000; and HTLV , 1:641,000.(See Chapters 8 and 9.) Transfusion has thepotential to modify the recipients' immune re- sponse. This is a potentially serious problem in many survivors of massive transfusion, who gen-erally develop immune compromise and are athigh risk for sepsis and multiple organ failure. Management of Massive Transfusion One thing is clear: the goal of hemorrhagic shock resuscitation is prompt restoration ofadequate perfusion and oxygen transport. The objective of resuscitation is to reestablish oxi- dative metabolism by providing adequate oxy-gen flow to cells, preventing reperfusion dam-age, and avoiding blood loss. Patients in hemorrhagic shock develop low pH from the buildup of intracellular hy-Table 2. Metabolic and Hemostatic Effects of Massive Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patient 37drogen ions, which occurs during the anaero- bic conversion of glucose to lactate. Some ofthe intracellular lactate and associated hydro-gen and producethe characteristic metabolic acidosis of hem-orrhagic shock. The pH, lactate level, and base deficit are highly correlated with mortality and are thought to be an underlying cause of de-creased cardiac contractility and eventual mor-tality. However, the clinical hemodynamic con-sequences of low serum pH are unclear. Manyclinicians give bicarbonate to increase cardiaccontractility. There is some evidence that con-tractility does not decrease substantially untilthe pH is 6.9 or 6.8, unless adequate oxygen is not available. 22 The most significant determi- nants of depressed cardiac contractility inshock appear to be hypercarbia and hy-poxia. 23,24 Clinically, if perfusion has been re- stored, oxygen delivery is adequate, and thepatient is well ventilated, pH correction withexogenous bicarbonate is unnecessary. Conventional fluid warmers, such as those in which fluid (crystalloid, colloid, or blood) is passed within plastic tubing through heat- ing blocks or those in which the tubing is sub-merged in warm water, are inefficient in deliv-ering normothermic fluids at fast flow rates(250 ml/min). With aggressive fluid resusci- tation and blood hypothermia, coagulopathy, hyper-kalemia, and hypocalcemia. Fluid warmers are designed to prevent and treat some of these problems. The H1000 infusion system (SimsLevel One Technologies, Inc., Rockland, Mas-sachusetts) is a very effective fluid-warmingdevice. It consists of a cylindric aluminum heatexchanger mounted on the warming unit andheated by a countercurrent water bath with aset point of 42 \u00b0C. To decrease heat loss even more, a second device can be added\u2014 theHotline warmer (Sims Level One Technolo- gies)\u2014on the 254-cm line between the H1000 and the patient. The central lumen of the in-travenous line is warmed by water circulatingin a countercurrent direction. The countercur-rent circulation water is warmed by a heatedreservoir, with a set point of 42 \u00b0C. Countercurrent water fluid warmers us- ing 42 \u00b0C set points do not damage red cells, deliver warm intravenous fluids, and allow the clinician to maintain thermal neutrality with respect to fluid management up to 400 ml/min.With flow rates above that, the infusion fluidtemperature will decrease slightly in propor-tion to the increase in flow rate. The H1000 infusion system is very useful for resuscitation of trauma victims, as it deliv-ers warm fluid at rapid rates. It takes care ofhypovolemia and prevention of hypothermia very well. Unfortunately, it is difficult to de- liver more than 800 ml/min with this infusionsystem. To achieve infusion rates above thislevel, our practice is to use the Rapid InfusionSystem (RIS, Haemonetics). This device is ca-pable of delivering 1,500 ml/min of bloodproducts at normothermia. At our institution, the system is primed with a crystalloid solu-tion and blood products are added to the 3-liter reservoir as indicated during the resusci-tation. Platelets are not infused with the RISdevice. They are infused through a separate intravenous access. The usual ratio of blood products used with the RIS follows the Uni-versity of Pittsburgh protocol, with 2 units ofpacked red cells (600 ml), 2 units of FFP (400ml), and 500 ml of a colloid or crystalloid so-lution. The hematocrit of this solution is 28%.All blood is filtered through a 150-micron fil-ter as it is introduced into the reservoir. It thenpasses through a 40-micron filter. The heat exchanger system also uses countercurrent technology. The fluid is infused with the aid ofa roller pump from a minimal rate of 10 ml/hrto a maximum of 1,500 ml/min. To our knowl-edge, at present, no other infusing system candeliver normothermic units at this rate. The use of the RIS has introduced new problems during resuscitation of trauma vic-tims. Although coagulopathies, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia have been well described in the literature as rare phenomena, we have no-ticed a high incidence of them after massivetransfusions. As discussed previously,coagulopathies and hypocalcemia are wellknown problems associated with rapid andmassive transfusions. Hyperkalemia is a rela-tively new phenomenon. Its incidence is highwhen using flow rates of 500 to 1,000 ml/min. As described by Jameson et al, 18 for prevention of transfusion-associated hyperkalemia, ourpractice is to use the Haemonetics Cellsaverblood salvage system in combination with theRIS. The Cellsaver system is used not only torecycle blood from the surgical field but also,and more importantly, to wash the blood bankPRBCs before transfusion to the trauma victim.Washing the PRBCs decreases the H+ and K+concentrations of the blood transfused and, in our experience, decreases the incidence of se- vere transfusion-associated hyperkalemia.

D'Alessio, MDElvis Presley Memorial Trauma CenterMemphis, Tennessee For multiple trauma patients with massive hemorrhage presenting for surgery, preopera-tive efforts have been directed at stabilizing (or at least temporizing) hemodynamic status. Ob- taining adequate intravenous access and infus-ing crystalloid and packed red blood cells areimportant measures in supporting circulatingblood volume. However, anesthesiologists arestill faced with precarious situations in whicheither all the above has taken place in the faceof ongoing hemorrhage, or some stabilizationhas occurred but surgical management will, of necessity, entail increased blood loss. In either case, the clinical sequelae of hemorrhage andshock (such as acidosis, hypothermia, andcoagulopathy) will begin to present at this point,problems that become all the more difficult ifnot managed early and effectively. In this section, we will discuss our expe- rience in the clinical management of patients'problems regarding massive transfusion. This discussion is not intended to represent a de- finitive management protocol, since muchdebate continues about such topics as appro-priate resuscitation strategies, desired clinicalend-points, and proper use of blood products.Rather, it is a \"walk through\" of the questions,trials, and decision-making processes that haveled us to our current use of the Rapid InfusionSystem (RIS) (Haemonetics Corporation, Braintree, Massachusetts) in conjunction with point-of-care chemistry-testing devices in man-aging these difficult problems. When our trauma center opened in 1983, we were using standard pressure bags con-nected to a pneumatic pump with six outletsand infusing fluids through a separate bloodwarmer. Although this approach was adequatefor several years, we were constantly struggling with problems of acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy in the face of ongoing and, occa-sionally, exsanguinating hemorrhage. Therefore,we began looking for ways to improve our abil-ity to keep up with massive hemorrhage. We initially considered the fluid-warming pressure infusers manufactured by Level I(Level I Technologies, Rockland, Massachu-setts). This system consisted of two pressure infusers connected to a blood warmer we had already been using. The advantages of this sys-tem were ease of use and portability. However,only two pressurized bags could be connectedto this system at any one time. Infusion rateswere comparable to or slightly faster than thepneumatic pumps used previously (approxi-mately 500 cc/min). The only commercially available system Rapid Infusion and Point-of-Care Chemistry Testing in Massive Transfusion: Avoiding Common Pitfalls specifically developed for volume infusion >500 cc/min is the RIS. This device utilizes rollerpumps that propel fluids from a 3-liter reser-voir through two limbs of high-capacity tubingat rates of up to 1,500 cc/min. The system alsodelivers 100-cc or 500-cc boluses over 1 minute.Additionally, there are three air detectors, whichautomatically stop the infusion in the event of bubbles in the infusion path. While some plan- ning and a brief set-up period of 3 to 5 minutesare required, it was readily apparent that sig-nificantly greater volumes of fluid could be in-fused in a short time. However, this device isrelative large and expensive, and it requiresmaintenance of an adequate supply of dispos-able tubing/reservoir set-ups. We currently employ both of these sys- tems, the Level I System 1000 being the more widespread of the two, with units in each op-erating room (OR), shock trauma admitting,and the intensive care unit. The combinationof the two systems has proven very useful, theLevel I being used perioperatively, with theoption of large-volume infusions with the RISif need for massive transfusion arises in theoperating room. Questions arose when we began using the RIS routinely in the OR. We found we had al-tered the dynamics of blood administration inour trauma OR, in that we were no longer the\"rate-limiting step.\" The blood bank raisedconcerns regarding appropriate use of bloodproducts and maintenance of an adequate sup-ply of these valuable resources. Additionally,some of our surgical colleagues expressed con- cern about striving for normotension with ag- gressive fluid administration and the effects thismay have on hemostatis. These issues were adirect result of our dramatically increased abil-ity to infuse large volumes. Other questions arose regarding some of the problems well known to be associated withmassive transfusion, 1-5 which are discussed elsewhere in this monograph. We noted clini- cally significant hyperkalemia on at least one occasion. Such related complications previ-ously thought to be infrequent were now morelikely to be encountered as infusion capabilityincreased. 1 As we worked through these issues, Hambly and Dutton concluded that using the RIS wasassociated with increased mortality. They alsoasked the question (raised by others 7-11) whether hypotensive resuscitation may be advantageous in this setting. This followed the article by Dun-ham and associates, 12 which showed a positive outcome associated with fluid administrationthrough the RIS. These considerations led to areassessment of our use of the RIS. Despite the problems we encountered, we felt there were distinct advantages in using theRIS. The primary, overriding advantage is thedramatically improved ability to maintain cir- culating blood volume. The ease and efficiencywith which these volumes are administered al-lows the anesthesia team to devote more men-tal and physical energy toward other criticalaspects of the case in progress. Further, withthe RIS there is much greater flexibility in therates of infusion. If one accepts the notion that hypotensive resuscitation is desirable, this would appear to be all the more reason to usethe RIS in such a scenario. In addition, the abil-ity of the RIS to arrest and reverse hypothermiato the point of warming a cold patient to nor-mothermia is significant and cannot be ignored. Thus, it was evident that the RIS possesses several undeniably desirable characteristics.Indeed, when one considers the five major problems encountered during massive trans- fusion (hypovolemia, hypothermia,coagulopathy, hyperkalmia, and hypocalce-mia), our experience has been that the RISaddresses hypovolemia and hypothermia effec-tively which, in turn, has beneficial effects indealing with acidosis and coagulopathy. 2 How- ever, we concluded the increased risks of sig-nificant hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia needed to be addressed separately. Since there is greater risk of physiologic derangement in this setting, we felt a need forcloser monitoring of physiologic parametersby laboratory tests. To obtain turnaround timesfaster than the hospital laboratory could pro-vide, we considered point-of-care testing de-vices. Point-of-care testing has gained favor inrecent years, one example being glucometers developed for home use, which enable diabet- ics to monitor their glucose levels. Newer tech-nologies have expanded this concept intoother areas involving a variety of laboratory pa-rameters relevant to intensive care and surgi-cal settings. After discussion with our laboratory direc- tor, we chose the i-STAT Portable Clinical Ana-lyzer (i-STAT Corp, Princeton, New Jersey). This device is hand-held and battery powered and comes with a portable printer. It is easy to useand relatively inexpensive and provides reliableaccurate results in 2 minutes. The system em-ploys a \"thin film\" biosensor housed in a smallcartridge. Two to three drops of blood are placedinto the cartridge, which is inserted into the ana-lyzer. The lab values obtained depend on theparticular cartridge used. There are several types available. The cartridge we use measures sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, arterial blood gases,hematocrit, and hemoglobin. There were earlyconcerns about the biosensor technology regard-ing manufacturing and failure rate. We have hadno problems in these areas. However, the i-STATdoes not provide point-of-care testing for coagu-lation studies, so we continue to send these toour trauma laboratory.13Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patient 39In addition to federally mandated quality assurance guidelines, there are a number ofpoint-of-care testing guidelines, which varyfrom state to state. Federal guidelines were setforth in the Clinical Laboratory ImprovementAct of 1967 and amended in 1988. The cur- rent rules and regulations are referred to as the CLIA '88 (Clinical Laboratory ImprovementAmendments of 1988). They divide laboratorytests into three categories: 1) waived (no spe-cial qualifications to run tests); 2) moderatelycomplex (requires high school diploma); and3) highly complex (requires an associate de-gree in laboratory science). The federal gov-ernment may inspect, fine, and even close fa- cilities found not to be in compliance. 13 An institution that performs laboratory tests isresponsible for compliance regardless of wherewithin the facility that testing is done. In addi-tion, four states (California, Florida, New York,and Tennessee) require that anyone not a cer-tified medical technologist (including MDs andCRNAs) must be granted a waiver in order torun lab tests. Thus, in order to avoid these types of problems, we recommend consulting the lab director of your institution if one ofthese devices is being considered. Another option available in avoiding com- plications of massive transfusion is washing redblood cells (RBCs) prior to infusion. Storageof packed red blood cells (PRBCs) results inaccumulation of potassium over time. 14 Wash- ing RBCs prior to administration removes much of this potassium as well as a significant proportion of existing citrate, which, in somecases, can result in hypocalcemia and cardio-vascular depression. 15 The removal of these agents can preempt some of the problems as-sociated with massive transfusion. This optionhas been employed successfully in a variety ofclinical settings. 1,16,17 We do not perform this routinely, except when treating patients witha history of renal insufficiency. In using the RIS in conjunction with the i- STAT, we employ the following strategy whenmassively transfusing a patient: * When the decision is made to use the RIS, we notify the blood bank than an RIS caseis starting. The blood bank then sets upwhat are termed \"RIS units\" consisting of10 units PRBCs, 4 units FFP , and 4 units of platelets (not to be infused through the RIS). The blood bank continues to holdone of these units until informed by usthat we are no longer in a massive trans-fusion mode. * Baseline labs are drawn, consisting of ar- terial blood gasses, complete blood count,PT/PTT, fibrinogen, potassium, and ion- ized calcium. * In filling the pump reservoir, PRBCs are diluted with 500 cc normal saline per unit.* We aim for a hematocrit in the low to mid-20s. * FFP are infused through the RIS in addi- tion to the NS. * Platelets are infused separately. * With each five units of packed cells given in 15 minutes or less, 1 gram of CaCl 2 is given. * Labs are repeated after each 10 units PRBCs. * Hyperkalemia (>6.0) is treated with 10 units regular insulin with D5W . * Acidosis is treated with volume infusion and sodium bicarbonate as deemed ap-propriate. * Cryoprecitipate is given based on fibrino- gen levels. * We continue to strive to maintain a rela- tively normotensive state in this setting.Communication with the surgical team,monitoring of urine output, and consid-eration of cerebral perfusion help guidedecisions regarding target pressures. As to the controversies concerning hypoten- sive resuscitation, use of the RIS in this scenario, and possible increased mortality associated withits use, close examination of the pertinent litera-ture led us to the following analysis. The conclusions reached in the study by Hambly and Dutton are clouded by two prob-lems. First, selection bias may have played asignificant role, as noted by the authors. Sec-ond, their findings are predicated on a com-parison of expected versus observed mortality between the study groups. They defined ex- pected mortality in this population based on alogistic regression equation published by Dun-ham et al from their institution in 1986. 18 This equation was written as a statistical descriptorof observed events at that institution, not as apredictor of mortality. They state, \"To ensurevalidity of the equation used to determine theprobability of death, a prospective assessment needs to be performed on another popula- tion.\" A search of the literature and conversa-tions with the author have not revealed such astudy. Therefore, the applicability of this equa-tion in predicting mortality in this populationmust be questioned. Such an equation or simi-lar predictive tool remains elusive. Regarding the question of hypotensive resuscitation, it should be noted that the study by Bickell et al deals with penetrating trauma, whereas Hambly and Dutton raise this issue intheir study on blunt trauma patients. Further,Bickell found increased survival with minimalresuscitation prior to, not in, the operatingroom, and full resuscitation once surgical con-trol of blood loss was obtained. This would not appear to be applicable to intraoperative use ofthe RIS as studied by Hambly and Dutton, sincetheir patients were, presumably, resuscitated inthe usual fashion prior to and after arrival atthe Shock Trauma Center. Before conclusions can be drawn regarding the appropriateness and timing of use of the RIS, more uniformitybetween Bickell's and Dutton's patients wouldhave to be demonstrated. Unanswered questions remain, along with the need for further controlled, well-focusedstudies. Whatever strategy is employed duringfluid resuscitation of the trauma patient andmassive transfusion, it is important to remem- ber to treat each patient individually, globally, and according to clinical judgment rather thanby strict protocol. Use of the RIS together withpoint-of-care testing and improved communi-cation with blood bank personnel, laboratorypersonnel, and surgeons improves our abilityto manage trauma patients requiring massivetransfusion.

Mackenzie, MB, ChB, FRCA, FCCMDirector, National Study Center for Traumaand Emergency Medical School of MedicineBaltimore, MD 21201 USAe-mail: cmack003@umaryland.edu [Editors' note: support from Biopure Corporation andAnjinomoto Corporation.] There has been only one reported use, in 1949, of a hemoglobin solution for resuscita-tion of a human in hemorrhagic shock. 1 A woman suffering from postpartum hemorrhagewas given 2.3 liters of 9% hemoglobin solution in saline after all available compatible blood had been given. Consciousness returned, her bloodpressure rose, and her heart rate fell. However,the patient died 9 days later from renal failure. Attempts to develop blood substitutes go back many hundreds of years 2 (Table 1). In 1916, hemoglobin solutions were given insmall quantities to 33 subjects to determinethe renal threshold for hemoglobin withoutadverse effects. Many studies, however, using larger quantities of hemoglobin solutions, had adverse effects, including hypertension, brady-cardia, oliguria, and anaphylaxis. 3 In 1957, Chang encapsulated hemoglobin,2 and since then development of liposome-encapsulatedhemoglobin has continued. The problems as-sociated with disposal of the encapsulatedhemoglobin and stimulation of the reticuloen- dothelial system and macrophages have notbeen resolved. Leland Clark demonstrated thata mouse could survive while breathing liquidperflurocarbons saturated with oxygen. 5 In 1972, Benesch discovered reagents that could bind the 2,3-DPG binding site so that they could reduce hemoglobin affinity for oxygen.The most widely used agent is pyridoxal, 5 PO 4 (so-called pyridoxalation), which is used toreduce oxygen affinity. 6 The normal P5O (the partial pressure of oxygen when Hb is 50%saturated) of blood is 26.7 mmHg. P5O is in-creased by pyridoxalation. Human stroma-freehemoglobin has a P5O of 12 to 15 mmHg and therefore has a high oxygen affinity and tends to hold onto the oxygen rather than give oxy-gen up at the tissue level. General Properties Red cells can be stored in liquid form with citrate phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA)anticoagulant for 35 days and in AS-1 for 42days. They can also be frozen after addition of glycerol to prevent lysis or they can be instantly freeze-dried or lyophilized. Oxygen-carryingsolutions (Table 2) may consist of free hemo-globin from which the stroma or cell wall hasbeen removed, or liposome-encapsulated he-moglobin containing hemoglobin with a syn-thetic membrane. Perfluorocarbons are organicsolutions with high oxygen solidity. Toxicities of free hemoglobin solutions(Table 3) include vasoactivity, with binding of nitric oxide by free hemoglobin being the main suspect causing vasoconstriction. 7 Nephrotox- icity from stromal remnants is probably of onlyhistorical interest, because better purificationtechniques have resulted in lack of renal tox-icity with newer hemoglobin-based oxygencarriers. 8 In human volunteers given recombi- Table 1.

Interferences occur with free hemoglobin so- lutions (Table 3). Use of hemoglobin-basedoxygen-carrying solutions interferes withfiberoptic oximetry because of the red color. 9 Mixed venous oxygen saturation is overesti-mated at low levels of 60% to 70%\u2014a danger-ous situation that may cause patients to beunderresuscitated. The interference is nonlin-ear, as it overestimates oxygen saturation at high venous oxygen tension. Pulse oximetry interference occurs because of methemoglo-bin. 10 Hemoglobin-based oxygen-carrying so- lutions make it impossible to carry out someliver function tests such as alkaline phosphatemeasurement 11 and coagulation tests such as partial thromboplastin time.12 They can also interfere with cross-matching, but this can beovercome with dilution. Methods to Prevent Complications of Oxygen-Carrying Solutions For many reasons, including avoidance of human disease transmission, sources otherthan outdated human blood have been usedto produce hemoglobin solutions. Transgenicpigs and mice have been bred to produce hu-man hemoglobin, and recombinant hemoglo- bins can be produced from bacteria and yeast by modifications that incorporate globin genes.For example, it is possible to express bothhuman a and b globin chains in Escherichia coli; however, the yields are still very low. About 750 liters of cell culture would beneeded to produce 1 unit of blood. Endotoxincontamination may also occur. 2 Sources of hemoglobin other than human include bovine hemoglobin. In addition, any of these hemoglobins can be modified to optimize their characteristics such as retention time; oxy-gen affinity, reduction of dimer conversion intotetramers, and prevention of oxidation to meth-emoglobin. Bovine hemoglobin has a high P5Owithout modification and is therefore of inter-est since it is also in plentiful supply. 13 Because of osmotic effects, most hemoglo- bin-based oxygen-carrying solutions are in con- centrations no greater than 7 to 8 g/dl. Perfluorocarbons have a linear oxygen dissocia-tion curve, and a relatively high oxygen contentof 50% or more is required for them to carryequivalent amounts of oxygen to hemoglobin.The second-generation perfluorocarbons(Perflubron) have more efficient oxygen carriage,even breathing 50% oxygen, whereas the first-generation (Fluosol) required 100% oxygen breathing to achieve even one-fourth the oxy- gen carriage of blood. 2 Hemoglobin may be modified by polymer- ization14 (Table 4). Polymerized hemoglobin is produced by addition of reactive groups to thesurface of hemoglobin. These reactive groupsprolong intravascular retention time but also make the hemoglobin more rigid. The polymer-ization reaction is very difficult to control, sothere is some batch-to-batch variability. An al-ternative to polymerization and this also prolongs reten- tion time. Some solutions can be polymerized and conjugated. Intravascular retention timecan be prolonged from 7 hours in the unmodi-fied form to about 36 hours after modification. The hemoglobin can be incorporated into an artificial cell, and liposome encapsulationis currently under study. However, the lipo-somes cause substantial drops in plateletcounts, and during excretion, they block the reticuloendothelial system. 4 A hemoglobin so- lution that has been studied in hemorrhagicshock is a pyridoxalated hemoglobinpolyoxyethylene conjugate made from stroma-free conjugation withpolyoxethylene to increase its half-life from 7to 36 hours and by pyridoxalation to increaseP5O from 15 to 20 mmHg. Maltose is added toprevent oxidation to methemoglobin. 15 The stimulus for all recent activity in de- velopment of hemoglobin-based oxygen-car-rying solutions is reduction of disease trans-mission, particularly of human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV) and hepatitis virus. From theperspective of the manufacturers of oxygen-carrying solutions, there is much interest be-cause it is estimated to be a potential $12 bil-lion a year industry. Their use in hemorrhagic shock is important because huge quantities of blood are currently used for this. In 1993, atthe Shock Trauma Center at the University ofMaryland, 1,300 patients were given 8,500units of blood, an average of 6.5 units per pa-tient, or about 50% to 60% of blood volumereplacement. The potential for replacing someof this blood use with an alternative is veryenticing for the manufactures of oxygen-carry-ing solutions and is also of interest to the Red Cross, which goes to great efforts to maintain this vital supply. Vascular and Other Physiologic Effects of Hemoglobin-BasedOxygenSubstitutes How do we judge whether hemoglobin- based oxygen-carrying solutions efficaciousin 1) restoration of intravascular pres-sures, 2) increase in cardiac output, and 3)reversal of the increased oxygen extraction thatoccurs in hemorrhagic shock. When studies using red cell substitutes to achieve the first two of these objectives are examined, difficul-ties in interpretation occur. The protocol andanimal model can influence the judgment ofefficacy. In one study in which a hemoglobinsolution was tested, the protocol specified thatfluid resuscitation should be given to restorecardiac filling pressures to baseline values. 16 If a vasoconstrictor response occurred with in- fusion of the hemoglobin-based oxygen-carry- ing solution, it would appear very efficaciousat restoring vascular pressures. In addition, theevidence for a vasoconstrictor response wouldbe minimized. Furthermore, if an awake dehy-drated pig model had been used instead of adog, as other studies have shown, the animalmay have died as a result of the hemoglobin-based oxygen-carrying solution causing pro- found vasoconstriction and reduced cardiac output. 17 If cardiac output and arterial blood pres- sure changes during resuscitation with oxygen-carrying solutions are examined, confoundingdata are also obtained. In two studies, cardiacoutput or blood pressure was less with hemo-globin solution infusion than with autologousblood transfusion. 18,19 In these four studies, cardiac output and arterial pressure changes were no different with hemoglobin solutionand blood resuscitation. 20-23 Only one study showed that the hemoglobin solution sus-tained oxygen transport at higher levels thandid non-oxygen-carrying solution volume ex-panders such as albumin or lactated Ringer'ssolution. 16 Transient cardiac output and blood pressure increases were greater half an hourafter resuscitation began with hemoglobin so- lution resuscitation compared with autologous blood reinfusion in another study. 15 So there are no clear-cut data showing what effects he-moglobin solutions in general have on arte-rial pressure and cardiac output, nor is theremuch information showing they are conclu-sively more beneficial than non-oxygen-carry-ing volume expanders. In some studies, oxy-gen transport was significantly impaired com- pared with whole blood because of a fall in hematocrit, 15 whereas in other studies oxygen transport is no different than with autologousblood resuscitation. 20-23 How can oxygen-carrying solutions have added value over blood as a means of deliver-ing oxygen to tissues? There are several po-tential ways, some of which have been con-firmed by experiments in animals. Because oxygen-carrying solutions are acellular, they are less viscous than blood and flow more eas-ily through narrow vessels and the microcir-culation. It is therefore possible that oxygen-carrying solutions may be useful in hemor-rhagic shock. There is experimental evidenceTable 4.

Encapsulation42 Massive Patientthat hemoglobin-based oxygen-carrying solu- oxgyen the intracellular space. 20 In addi- tion, when compared with whole autologousblood, a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier pre-served exercise capacity in humans. Diffusion of carbon monoxide across the alveolar-capil- lary membrane (DLCO) and blood lactate lev-els were measured during exercise in hu-mans. 25 There was a greater oxygen uptake and for CO2 production and normal lactate levels were maintained in those given hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers in comparison with sub-jects given autologous blood. Infusion of 1gram of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers in- creased DLCO as much as 3 grams of autolo- gous blood. In addition to the short-term benefits of enhanced diffusion, hemoglobin-based oxy-gen carriers may have longer lasting effects,as it has been shown that serum iron, fer-ritin, and erythropoietin increase in parallelwith plasma levels of hemoglobin. The ironinfusion adds the equivalent of one unit of blood transfusion within 1 week of hemo- globin infusion. 25 Newly discovered allosteric and electric properties of hemoglobin appear to controlblood pressure and may facilitate tissue oxy-genation. S-Nitrous-hemoglobin (SNO-Hb) isfree of vasoactivity and may be a route for effi-cient delivery of nitric oxide to mitochondrial a good he- moglobin-based oxygen-carrying solution. 7. Other properties besides oxygen transport affect assessment of efficacy of red cell substi-tutes. Profound increases in pulmonary pres-sures can cause fatalities in some animals andprevented any benefit from being realized dueto hemoglobin solution infusion. 17 When changes in pulmonary artery pressure are com-pared after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock with oxygen-carrying solutions, interspecies differences as well as protocolsand models become confounding variables.The rise in pulmonary artery pressure afterresuscitation in the swine model greatly ex-ceeds that seen in the dog. 17 In some studies, fluid resuscitation is given with the objectiveof returning filling pressures to baseline val-ues, so that if a vasoconstrictor response oc- curred with infusion, the protocol used would prevent this difference from becoming appar-ent. 20 Several investigators have also noted thrombocytopenia after infusion of red cellsubstitutes, and clearly it is critical that red cellsubstitutes for use in the management of hem-orrhagic shock should not interfere with resi-dent blood cells or the coagulation system, asthese toxicities would preclude their use in the management of patients with trauma or those undergoing surgery. Hemostatic Effects The effects of free hemoglobin solutions on coagulation and blood cellular componentswere examined with resuscitation from severe hemorrhagic shock in dogs. 24 The solutions used were 8% hemoglobinpolyoxyethylene conjugate and the samesolution made by diluting PHP88 with equal volume of Plasmalyte A (PHP44), and stroma- free hemoglobin (SFH), a simple non-conju-gated hemoglobin solution. Both hemoglobinsolutions were highly purified and endotoxinfree. Use of these three hemoglobin solutionswas compared with re-infusion of autologousblood. The volume of blood removed to pro-duce 2 hours of shock was 63% of the estimatedblood volume. Resuscitation began with flu- ids infused at 20 ml/min by infusion pump; in four dogs, no resuscitation was given. Samplesfor coagulation and hematology profiles and ablood smear were taken one-half hour afterresuscitation began, when all the hemoglobin-based oxygen-carrying solutions were infusedor, in the case of non-resuscitated dogs, noadditional fluids were given. Measurementswere repeated at 2, 4, and 6 hours after resus- citation, and then daily for 7 days after awak- ening from anesthesia. All dogs not resuscitated died within 2 hours. All autologous blood and PHP44 dogssurvived 8 days, while mortality among PHP88dogs was 63% and among SFH dogs, 14%.Clinical coagulopathy occurred in all dogsgiven PHP88 and in four of the six dogs givenSFH, and there was evidence of hematoma for- mation around cannulation sites in all six dogs given PHP44 and five of the six dogs given au-tologous blood when autopsy was performed.Clinical coagulopathy with spontaneous devel-opment of oozing from percutaneously placedcannulae, spontaneous development of he-matomas in the femoral areas where catheterswere placed, and in some dogs receiving bothPHP and SFH petechiae were visible subcuta-neously all over the body, and submucosally in the mouth. In the dogs that died, exsan- guination was the major cause of mortalitysecondary to thrombocytopenia. Death oc-curred between 7 and 254 hours after infusionof the hemoglobin solution. There was a fall in hematocrit (Hct) in all animals resuscitated with these cellular fluids.However, the fall in animals given PHP88 wassignificantly greater than in those receiving the other solutions, with an average Hct of 3% af- ter resuscitation. 15 Since 63% of the estimated blood volume was removed and because he-matocrit was, on average, about 40% beforeresuscitation, it was expected on the basis ofhemodilution alone, that Hct would be about25%. The finding that Hct was between 9%and 11% with PHP44 and SFH suggests thatthese hemoglobin solutions also had some adverse effect on red cells. The possibility of hemolysis occurring was explored by hemo-globin electrophoresis of the plasma samples\u2014the PHP and SFH were both derived from hu-man hemoglobin. If hemolysis had occurred,canine hemoglobin would be found in theplasma. None was identified by hemoglobin electrophoresis (which can clearly distinguishthe two types of hemoglobin). In addition,measurements of plasma hemoglobin gavevalues consistent with the quantities of hemo-globin-based oxygen-carrying solutions in- fused. Red cell counts show the same picture as Hct. These data strongly suggest that cellswere being removed from the circulation. Itwas postulated that they may be sequesteredin circulatory beds as a result of endothelial orother interactions. Why thrombocytopenia occurred and why there was a reduction in all other cellu-lar components remains the cause of much speculation and investigation. Many factors are known to give rise to platelet adhesive-ness and rouleaux formation, including re-lease of thromboxane, reac-tions, including binding of nitric of free heme alsoinduces platelet aggregation. Hemodilutionis another important factor causing thromb-ocytopenia, as this was a severe hemorrhagic shock model in which 63% of the circulating blood volume, and therefore cellular compo-nents of the blood, were removed from thecirculation. In addition, the high colloidoncotic pressure of these hemoglobin solu-tions may have further accentuated the circu-lating volume increase and dilution of cellu-lar components. 15 It was speculated that, as a result of platelet aggregation and rouleaux formation, platelets and red cells are trapped in the microcirculation and this sequestrationprevents their subsequent employment incoagulation and oxygen transport. A factorthat may additionally or singularly be thecause of the problem is the polyoxyethylenemoiety attached to hemoglobin in PHP . It isused to increase molecular size and prolongvascular retention time. However, it may alsocause electrostatic charges that increase the likelihood of platelet aggregation and red cell rouleaux formations. Mediators released dur-ing hemorrhagic shock are probably an im-portant determinant of the cell aggregationseen with infusion of PHP . No coagulopathyor mortality was found in dogs undergoingexchange transfusions with PHP of 80% ofblood volume or in nonvolemic dogs given20 ml/kg of PHP . Changes that occur during hemorrhagic shock exacerbate the effects of large doses of PHP . The whole issue is very complex. An ob- vious possible mechanism of platelet aggre-gation, namely, binding of nitric oxide by freehemoglobin, has not been excluded. Freeheme can cause platelet aggregation, as canthromboxane release secondary to hemor-rhagic shock. The coagulopathy that occurred with PHP may be a combination of some or all of these mechanisms. Conclusion The studies discussed illustrate some very important facts about the data that are avail-Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patient 43able on oxygen-carrying solutions. First, there is virtually no published data on use of any ofthese products in humans for resuscitationfrom hemorrhage shock. Second, much ofthe evidence for the oxygen-carrying solu-tions currently under study in humans un- dergoing Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials to ob- tain FDA approval is proprietary. As a result,the data in the literature may not be scien-tifically valid, as adverse effects may be mini-mized. Third, there are interspecies varia-tions, so that toxicities or benefit seen witha product in animal studies may not trans-late into reality in human studies. Fourth,endothelial interactions are still not com- pletely understood and could result in ad- verse reactions to oxygen-carrying solutionsthat preclude their use in shock. Fifth, me-diators released during reperfusion or con-ditions that of hemoglobin-based oxygen-carrying of similar quantities of one he-moglobin-based oxygen-carrying solution (PHP) to animals not in shock does not re- sult in coagulopathy or mortality. Sixth, mi-nor changes among several potential modi-fications can significantly alter the toxicitiesof oxygen-carrying solutions. What then is the future of hemoglobin and perfluorocarbon-based oxygen-carrying solu-tion? From news through the proprietary grape-vine, it appears that an equivalent of a two-unit transfusion of oxygen-carrying solution is well tolerated by the majority of individuals whengiven in elective surgical circumstances. The sideeffects are relatively minor, including gas-trointestinal upset, musculoskeletal aches, andheadache. One worrisome side effect that isrumored has been the de velopment of pancre- atitis or signs of pancreatic changes seen in avery few individuals receiving some hemoglo-bin-based oxygen-carrying solutions. Another worrisome issue was the indefinite postpone- ment of a Phase 3 trial of a hemoglobin-basedoxygen solution in patients with trauma andhemorrhagic shock, presumably because ofincreased mortality in the study group ( Wall Street Journal , February 6, 1998). The data that led to the action have not been madepublic to date. Other potential future uses include man- agement of ischemic disease and angioplasty. properties and enhancemitochondrial oxygenation. In some tumors,radiosensitivity is increased by means of in-creased oxygen levels. A further potential useof oxygen-carrying solutions is as an adjunctto radiation therapy for certain tumors. Insickle cell crisis, perfusion and oxygenation may be improved with oxygen-carrying solu- tions and hematopoietic stimulation may bea result of infusion of a hemoglobin-basedoxygen-carrying solution. Because of the abil-ity to carry oxygen, these solutions may alsobe useful for organ preservation, extracorpo-real organ perfusion, and cardioplegia. Poten- tial future uses also include transfusion alter-native in patients with red cell incompatibili-ties. For Jehovah's Witnesses, perfluorocarbon,but not hemoglobin-based oxygen-carryingsolutions, are an acceptable alternative to blood transfusion. References 1. Amberson WR, Jennings JJ, Rhode CM.

However, oxygen-carry-ing modified hemoglobin solutions andperfluorocarbons have been referred to as\"blood substitutes.\" Since these recently devel-oped solutions can only carry out selected func-tions of blood, they are more accurately referredto as \"oxygen-carrying volume expanders.\" Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) are modified hemoglobin solutions or hemoglobin packaged into liposomes,which are able to deliver oxygen to tissues. Ahemoglobin therapeutic is a hemoglobin so-lution optimized through chemical modifica-tion to bring about certain pharmacologic andtherapeutic effects. Hemoglobin therapeuticsmay possess a combination of therapeuticallyactive properties such as oxygen-carrying ca- pacity, favorable rheologic properties, and pressor action. Need for Blood Substitutes Although blood transfusions represent a life-saving measure for many medical and sur-gical patients, there are still problems with ho-mologous blood transfusions in the United Hemoglobin Therapeutics, Blood Substitutes, and High Volume Blood Loss States. Oxygen-carrying volume expanders may be particularly helpful in situations where blood is not available (remote areas; difficultcross match; rare blood type, etc.). Further-more, a national blood shortage is predictedwith the aging of America, since the over-65age group has a high demand for blood. Thisage group represents 12.5% of the populationbut receives 50% of all blood transfusions. Therisk of infection from blood has decreased dra- matically, but potentially could be eliminated with blood substitutes (although it is recog-nized that prions and other agents appear toresist sterilization). Allogeneic blood also isassociated with a higher surgical infection rate,presumably related to the immunosuppressiveeffects of white blood cells contained in non-leuko-depleted blood. Desirable \"blood substitutes\" have a long shelf life, a long circulation half-life, good oxy- gen carrying capacity and tissue oxygen deliv-ery, few side effects, and reasonable cost. Fur-thermore, their use should not interfere withdiagnostic tests or the clinical diagnosis of se-rious disease processes. Hemoglobin-Based Oxygen Carriers Structure and Design Free, unmodified human tetrameric he- moglobin rapidly dissociates into dimers removed from its normalenvironment inside the erythrocyte. Dissocia-tion into hemoglobin fragments leads to renaltoxicity and greatly increased oxygen affinity,precluding effective tissue oxygen delivery. Manufacturers of HBOCs therefore haveundertaken a variety of strategies to modify the native hemoglobin molecule in order to stabi- lize it, extend intravascular residence time, andreturn its oxygen-unloading therange of erythrocyte-based hemoglobin. Onesuch method is intramolecular cross-linkingbetween beta chains. Other involve orconjugation to larger molecules, includingpolyethylene glycol hemoglobin into a liposome or polymer struc- ture has also been pursued. There is a dilemmain the trade-off between desirable properties:Larger hemoglobins and liposomes half-lives and are less active in scaveng-ing nitric oxide (NO) from the endothelium(which limits their hypertensive properties).Unfortunately, they also undergo acceleratedauto-oxidation, hemoglobin peroxidation, and heme loss. 1 On the other hand, smaller spe- cies are less antigenic but can be filtered bythe kidneys, are more oncotically active, andhave shorter vascular residence times. Such \"designer\" modifications stabilize the molecule's tetrameric structure and affect mo-lecular size, renal filtration, P50 (defined as theoxygen tension at which hemoglobin oxygensaturation is 50%), affinity to NO binding, cir- culation half life, and more. The raw material for hemoglobin solutions can be human redblood cells, bovine red blood cells, or recombi-nant Escherichia coli bacteria. To date, no he- moglobin solution has been approved for hu-man use, although several are being investigatedfor safety and efficacy (Table 1). Table 1.

Circulation half-lives are measured in hours (4-24 hours, of- ten dose dependent) rather than days, as would be the case for red blood cells. All currently investigated hemoglobins elevate systemic and pulmonary vascular re-sistance, resulting in a mild reduction in car-diac example, diaspirin cross-linkedhemoglobin (DCLHb), an alpha-alpha cross-linked produces a predictable, rapid,and sustained rise in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and in systemic and pulmonary vascu- lar resistance. 2 At the microcirculatory level, functional capillary density is reduced.3 The pressor response is dose dependent and phar-macologically reversible and exhibits a \"ceil-ing effect.\" 4,5 In human volunteers, 100 mg/kg DCLHb raised median systolic BP maximallyby no more than 10 mmHg and diastolic BP byno more than about 15 mmHg. 6 Biopure's HBOC-201 raised MAP by about 10 mmHg when a dose of 0.6 g/kg was administered tohealthy volunteers, 7 but it had no significant effect on blood pressure when given to surgi-cal patients. 8 In the author's clinical investiga- tive experience with 1g/kg DCLHb adminis-tered to patients undergoing major orthope-dic and urologic surgery, MAP was elevated byan average of about 20 mmHg, the hyperten- sive effect persisting for 24 to 30 hours after administration. 9 Although HBOC-associated hypertension has not been associated withadverse cardiac events, selected patients arelikely to require treatment of hemoglobin-in-duced systemic and pulmonary hypertension. The mechanisms thought to account for this pressor effect are the scavenging of NOfrom vascular endothelium, facilitation ofendothelin production and, possibly, a sym- pathomimetic effect. The smaller the hemoglo- bin molecule the more effectively it interactswith the endothelium, penetrating it and scav-enging endothelial NO to form met-hemoglo-bin and NO-hemoglobin. 10 In the operative setting, several factors may blunt HBOC-associated hypertensive ten-dencies. The hypotensive action of surgicalhemorrhage, 11 as well as volume depletion,12,13 may diminish hypertension. Furthermore, ha-lothane and propofol, but not isoflurane, havebeen shown to decrease the hypertensive ac-tion of DCLHb on pulmonary vein rings. 14 Hemoglobin solutions have colloidal properties (Table 1), are highly purified, gen-erally do not affect coagulation, and are onlyweakly antigenic. Modified molecular hemo-globin undergoes oxidation to methemoglo- bin and leaves the circulation primarily through the reticuloendothelial system. Pre-clinical and clinical studies indicate that modi-fied hemoglobins can mildly increase the con-centrations of plasma CPK (but not MB frac-tion), hepatic enzymes, reticulocyte count, bi-lirubin, and amylase. 15-17 In study of patients undergoing high-blood-loss (approximatelyhalf of an adult's blood volume) surgical pro-cedures, BUN, discoloration; possibly pan- creatitis. However, pancreatitis occurs fre-quently after major abdominal surgery 18-20 even in the absence of HBOC administration. Thegastrointestinal side effects of DCLHb maybe related to its ability to interfere with NO production and signaling, 21 thus possibly af- fecting gastrointestinal and biliary motility.Judging from preclinical studies 22,23 of intesti- nal and portal system blood flow after admin-istration of DCLHb, gastrointestinal side ef-fects are unlikely the result of tissue ischemia. Toxicity Toxicity of hemoglobin solutions has his- torically been related to impurities such as RBC membrane residues, endotoxin, free dimers,and monomers. With vastly improved purifi-cation procedures, concern over toxicity fromimpurities is waning. In particular, the issueof renal toxicity appears to have been over-come. In rats, 0.4 g/kg DCLHb did not affectrenal blood flow. 23 Creatinine clearance was neither decreased by 0.1 g/kg DCLHb4 nor by 0.32 g recombinant hemoglobin24 in human volunteers. It was similarly unaffected by upto 0.7 g/kg in critically ill patients with sepsissyndrome 25 by 750 ml DCLHb in cardiac pa- tients,26 and by 1.0 g/kg DCLHb in patients undergoing high-blood-loss surgery, despitethe occurrence of hemoglobinuria at the higherdoses. 9 Neither was renal toxicity observed with polymerized hemoglobin.27 Free hemoglobin, then directly applied to central nervous system tissue, is neurotoxic. It stimulates leukocyte migration and vascularadherence. promoting 28 Circulating fer- rous hemoglobin, even when highly purified,undergoes a number of reactions that maycontribute to toxicity. 29 Ferrous hemoglobin binds NO about 3,000 times more tightly thancarbon monoxide and therefore effectively re- moves any NO in its vicinity, accounting for the vasoactive properties. Free hemoglobin isconverted to methemoglobin at a rate as fastas 4% per hour; this reaction can lead to thegeneration of free radicals. Hemoglobin alsohas a number of \"pseudo-enzymatic\" proper-ties, which could lead to oxygenation, lipidperoxidation, and cytotoxicity. Further possi-bilities for toxicity arise from the degradation products of hemoglobin's heme moiety such as hemin. Red blood cells contain antioxidantenzymes such as catalase and superoxidedismutase, which may help limit ischemiareperfusion injury. It has been speculated thatthe administration of pure hemoglobin (i.e.,without antioxidants) may lead to a potentially higher risk of reperfusion injury. 30 Although many early trials indicate that some HBOCs have not been associated withsevere toxicity, more study in a wide variety ofclinical situations is required before their side effects are fully known. Investigation into the effects of HBOCs on the gastrointestinal sys-tem, pulmonary vasculature, and organ func-tion during hemorrhagic and other stress isparticularly needed. Furthermore, the charac-teristics of HBOC-assisted oxygen delivery andtissue oxygen availability during supply-depen-dent conditions need additional investigation. Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) Perfluorocarbons are inert aromatic or aliphatic chemicals that can dissolve oxygenand carry it in solution throughout the body.They typically carry 4 to 50 vol% at a PaO 2 of 160 mmHg; their ability to carry oxygen is di-rectly proportional to their concentration inblood and, importantly, to the partial pressureof oxygen. The first fluorocarbon to be ap- proved for clinical use (during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) was fluosolDA-20, which used as an oxygen-carrying vol-ume expander, fluosol DA was associated witha number of limitations, including low oxygen-carrying capacity, short shelf life, temperatureinstability, and serious side effects. Second-generation perfluorocarbons, such as perfluoro-octylbromide (PFOB; Alliance Phar- maceuticals), are being investigated and showpromise because of a much higher oxygen-car-rying capacity, a 2- to 4-year refrigerated shelflife, low viscosity, and less interference withnormal pulmonary surfactant mechanisms. 31 Since PFCs are not metabolized, but ex- creted unchanged via the lungs, their poten-tial for cytotoxicity is thought to be limited.There is no antigenicity. However, since PFCs are taken up avidly by the reticuloendothelial system, they increase liver enzymes and resultin hepatosplenomegaly. Because of the exten-sive uptake in the reticuloendothelial systemand impairment of neutrophil function, theymay interfere with host defense mechanisms.Monocyte and macrophage activation may leadto release of prostaglandins, endoperoxides,and cytokines, which probably accounts for the symptoms of flushing, backache, fever, chills, headaches, and nausea observed in clinical tri-als. Platelet count decreases by as much as 40%due to increased platelet clearance from PFC-induced modification of platelet surfaces. 32 PFCs also may prolong the effects of certaindrugs, including barbiturates. Potential Clinical Uses and Effective- ness of HBOCs Major Surgical Bleeding and Hemorrhagic Shock Fluid therapy for the acutely bleeding pa- tient can be accomplished initially with eithercrystalloid or colloid solutions. Blood transfu-sion is begun when, despite volume resuscita-46 Massive Transfusion and Control of Hemorrhage in the Trauma Patienttion with non-oxygen carrying solutions, there is evidence of tissue ischemia and resultantorgan dysfunction. Accumulation of base defi-cit and serum lactate and low central venousoxygen concentration are all indices of tissueischemia, which should be taken into consid- eration in the transfusion decision. 33 Alterna- tively, blood is transfused when organ ischemiacan be anticipated, given the extent and rapid-ity of ongoing bleeding. Hemoglobin solutions are as effective as whole blood in restoring MAP in animals 34-36 and humans.12 In contrast to typical catecholamine effects, the pressor response of DCLHb is as-sociated with an increase in perfusion (as indi- cated by organ flow measurements) in both top- load hypovolemic, shock. 37,38 salu- tary effect may to DCLHb's effecton tissue perfusion and peripheral oxygenation.For example, tissue oxygenation, measured di- rectly by a fluorescence-quenching optode, was restored more effectively in a rat hemorrhagicshock model treated with DCLHb comparedwith lactated Ringer's solution and albumin. 41 Despite increased total peripheral vascular re-sistance, rat coronary blood flow 23 was aug- mented after DCLHb and human cerebralblood flow was unchanged after infusion ofpolymerized hemoglobin. 42 Despite their vasoconstrictive properties, HBOCs may counteract tissue hypoperfusionwith added blood oxygen-carrying capacity andbetter rheologic properties. In cerebralartery hemodilution with DCLHb(to of 30, resulted in asignificant dose-dependent reduction in theextent of brain injury and cerebral edema. 43 The most effective reductions in ischemic in- jury occurred in those animals in which the inherent hypertensive response to DCLHbwas not inhibited. The effect of HBOCs on cardiac index is more controversial, with some studies report-ing a slight decrease, 44 others no change.25 Cal- culated oxygen delivery generally follows car-diac output, thus accounting for the slight de-creases reported. However, increased tissue- dffusing capacity has been shown. 7 Further- more, the equivalent or enhanced oxygen-un-loading capacity of HBOCs compared withblood should allow favorable tissue oxygendelivery, or at least counteract vasoconstrictiveeffects of free hemoglobins. Therefore, their usein trauma patients and in those with substan-tial surgical bleeding would seem reasonable.Table 2 suggests potential uses of HBOCs for therapy of patients suffering large blood losses. However, because of their short half-lives, current hemoglobin solutions are likely to beused essentially as a \"bridge to transfusion.\"For example, the half-life of DCLHb admin-istered to patients undergoing high-blood-losssurgery was approximately 10 hours. 45 Admin- istration of DCLHb after bypass spared nearly20% of cardiac patients from allogeneic trans-fusion. 46 Nevertheless, there is also concern that the administration of modified hemoglo- bins merely delays blood transfusion rather than truly substituting for it. Preoperative acute normovolemic hemodi- lution (ANH) is likely to become more attrac-tive with the use of modified hemoglobins as adiluent. The short half-life of HBOCs does notpresent a significant liability for this clinical ap-plication. Patients with low preoperative hema-tocrit might receive an infusion of HBOC to \"tidethem over\" a limited period of intraoperative or postoperative bleeding, after which autolo-gous or allogeneic blood would be administeredif still needed. Furthermore, volume replace-ment with HBOCs (compared with crystalloidor colloid) during ANH for autologous collec- tion would likely result in a greater yield of pheresed blood components. Caveats Regarding the Use of HBOCs for Major Blood Loss (Table 3) The safety of large-scale and rapid transfu- sion of HBOCs in human traumatic injury re-mains to be demonstrated. While the author'ssmall series of patients undergoing high-blood- loss elective surgery tolerated up to 1g/kg DCLHb relatively well, 9 a phase III trial of DCLHb for resuscitation of traumatically in-jured patients was halted among concerns aboutincreased mortality in the study group. Because HBOCs are associated with sys- temic hypertension, concern has been raisedover a potential for increased blood loss inhemorrhage. This concern could not be cor- roborated in preclinical 40 or clinical studies9 conducted in a setting of hemorrhage, but the issue has yet to be clarified in the setting ofpenetrating trauma. The clinical use of HBOCs with relatively short half-lives must take into account theirtendency for transvascular migration and theirrapid clearance through the reticuloendothe-lial system. Although the initial effect of trans- fusion may be an immediate increase in vascu- lar volume (enhanced by some HBOCs' col-loidal properties) and blood pressure (medi-ated by the HBOCs' NO-scavenging effect),rapid dissipation of the HBOC requires care-Table 2.

Interfer- ence with laboratory testing constitutes animportant limitation for the potential clinicaluse of artificial hemoglobin species. Other Uses: Hemoglobin Therapeutics? Since NO plays a part in the pathogenesis of septic shock, modified hemoglobins maybecome useful in the treatment or prevention of severe septic shock. Artificial oxygen carri- ers also may be used for oxygen delivery toischemic tissues (as in stroke or intestinal is-chemia) and tumor cells to improve their sus-ceptibility to radiation and chemotherapy. Be-cause iron is one of the breakdown productsof hemoglobin metabolism, hemoglobintherapy may stimulate erythropoiesis undercertain circumstances. These and other poten- salutary HBOCs, which tran- scend basic oxygen-carrying properties, haveled to an emerging interest in the area of \"he-moglobin therapeutics.\" References 1.
