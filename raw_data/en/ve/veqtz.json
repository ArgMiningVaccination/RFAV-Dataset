HLH Center of Excellence www.cincinnatichildrens.org/hlh Family to Family: What I wish I'd known about Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Dear Parent,Dear Parent,Dear Parent, HLH can be a scary world. We are very sorry that this disease has struck your family, but by virtue of the fact that you are reading this book, you have found the right experts to care for your family. The team you contacted in Cincinnati is the best you will find anywhere. HLH is a very difficult disease, there's no denying that, but survival IS possi- ble. There are many survivors, and there are even HLH survivors who THRIVE, but only with the right combination of medical care, diligence, support, and optimism. Arm yourself with knowledge and positive energy, and keep moving forward. Never look back, never ask why or say \"poor me,\" but always forge forward and try to help all of the others on this journey with you. It takes a village to get through this crisis; look around you and help the others. Accept help from some, and return the favor by helping the other families. By helping others, you will take the focus off of yourself for a moment, find a second of relief from your stress, and re -energize yourself with positive energy. Read as much as you can, starting with these materials. Constantly research and learn about the medical issues, stay positive, and stay strong. Best wishes and may there be a higher power protecting you and your family. Stay the course, Ann Flaherty, RN, BSN HLH/BMT mother From our HLH Family to Yours,From our HLH Family to Yours,From our HLH Family to Yours, Treatment for a rare disease, like HLH is incredibly isolating. No matter where you are, facing a rare disease changes you, your perspective and the way that you experience the world around you. The advice in this book was gathered during a family conference from a group of experienced families who have faced an HLH diagnosis. Many were treated at Cincinnati Children's, but not all. What you will read on the following pages is advice from real families, based off of their actu- al experiences facing HLH. The pictures in this book are of real HLH patients who have become part of our greater HLH family. This booklet was created to help those starting out on the journey, so that they may be more prepared and know that they are not alone. We express our sincere appre- ciation for the families involved in this project, as there is nothing more powerful than kind words from a family who has already trodden the same path, to one who is just beginning it.

Like many patients, Jen- nifer's illness started out of the blue. On a normal day, while at dance camp, she began to feel feverish and sick. After that, she only remembers bits and pieces. \"I was never really scared, just tired and felt sick, but I also had lost all track of time\". She was admitted to the hospital where she was diagnosed with HLH and a CMV infection. Jennifer was inpatient for several weeks, and on a ventilator for over a week. Jennifer's family leaned on their faith, and a great team of doctors to get through this terrifying time. Slow- ly, her disease improved with steroid treatment, and happily Jennifer did not need at bone mar- row transplant. We asked Jennifer how she feels about her experience today: \"I would be a different person if this moment had not have opened my eyes. I have grown more thankful for the people in my life. I have become more conscious of others and their feelings, be- cause we do not always know what hardships they may be facing. I now know how precious life is and try my hardest to live it the best way I can.\" Ava William Alex Ask Questions. I wish I would've asked more. Keep a notebook with your questions and notes. I kept a 3 ring binder to track all of my child's medical information. Pay attention to the medicines your child is being given, it's ok to ask what someone is giving your child. It's also ok to ask staff if they have washed their hands . Keeping your child free of germs is important. Finding Answers.... Finding Answers.... Finding Answers.... No one loves your child as much as you do. You are your child's best advocate. If you are planning an inpatient admit, ask for a list of items that you should bring. Ideas include favorite blankets, movies, toys. Ask about visitor rules, so that you can know ahead of time and plan accordingly. Don't assume that all units have the same rules. Ask for the contact information of your nurse care manager or a person who you can reach when you have questions. Keep it handy. Ask the Child Life division to help you plan activities or special things for your child while you are in the hospital. Talk with your child about things other than being sick. Remember, there is more to your child than their illness. Help them to remember this, too. It will give you quality time together and will make good memories as well. Ask about other supports that are available to you in the hospital. There are social workers, PT, OT, Speech, possibly music therapy or holistic health. Every situation will be completely unique. I felt like I was a parent and a nurse and sometimes a doctor. Ask for help from your team when you need it. Ask to review things when you aren't sure. Phrase your questions on a point scale. It will help you to gain perspective. \"Where is my child on a scale of 1 -10?\" Ask about genetic testing and if other family members should be tested for HLH genetic muta- tions. Find out if your child will need a bone marrow transplant. Ask how donor matching works. Finding Your Way...Finding Your Way...Finding Your Way... \"HLH treatment is a marathon, not a sprint.\" Plan for the long term. Check the sources of the information that you find online to be sure they are reputable. Use www.carepages.com, social media or a blog to keep family updated instead of repeating yourself over and over. Figure out how to make your life work with these changes. Can you work remotely from the hospital? Be proactive about insurance denials, call your insurance company and ask questions about your coverage. Connect with others families, those who have been out a few years, they will give you hope. Ask your child's friends to keep in touch. It's im- portant for your child to have a sense of connected- ness to those who love and support them. Use the Family Resource Center for discounted hotels, computer acess, and finding your way around town. Some hospitals have a concierge service that can help with errands. Check with your insurance plan if you have cover- age for daily needs or hotels while receiving out of town treatment. Ask the social worker about additional resources that might help with expenses. Don't be afraid to ask for help, both physically and emotionally. People usually ask to help and so take them up on it! Have one person in charge of laundry, one in charge of meals, one in charge of taking the kids to after -school activities, one in charge of taking out the trash. Ask some one to pick up your mail or have it forwarded. Start a wish list for family and friends to help with. You could even do it online. Books, toys, or other items for your child Online movie subscription EZ pass for traveling toll roads to ap- pointments or pre -paid gas cards gift cards for the cafeteria Restaurant gift cards for places nearby Stamps, writing supplies Drawing or other hobby supplies to help your child pass the time Take care of yourself. This cannot be underestimated. Find a routine that works for you. Take a few minutes to get lunch, read, or take a walk. Step outside for a while. Don't isolate yourself. Talk with other parents. Find a support system that fits you: online groups, emailing friends, or calling home. Make the time to do this, it's important. \"I'd wish I'd known about the physical changes involved with steroids and treatment.\" Steroids can cause weight gain, hair growth, high blood pressure, moodiness (may cry a lot), and high blood sugar.

Alex was transplanted for HLH as an infant at Cincinnati Children's, has graduated high school and attends Wake Forest University. Alex pictured above with his parents in 2015.

HLH happens most often in children, but adults can get it too. Most adult doctors are not experienced in treat- ing HLH because it is so rare and that is how a 36 year old can end up in a children's hospital! Aaron had an autoimmune disease called mixed con- nective tissue disease for a few years when he became ill with a fever, weakness and body aches. Aaron was admitted to a hospital in New York, where things got worse. He developed the signs of HLH in his blood (low counts, high ferritin) and his organs began to fail. Aaron was on a ventilator and needed dialysis. Aaron's loyal and well -named brother Happy was at his side ad- vocating for every effort to be made to help Aaron. Aaron's doctors conferred with Cincinnati and started treatment for HLH. After 6 weeks in New York, Aaron transferred to Cincinnati for treatment and fit in very nicely in a children's hospital! The good news is that Aaron continued to get better and he is now, home, his organs are all working just fine and he is off all HLH treatment. Happy rode in the \"700 miles for Hope\" HLH fundraiser in honor of Aaron and his courage in winning against this tricky disease! My HLH StoryMy HLH StoryMy HLH Story Know that there will be times of uncertainty. The journey is long , much longer than I had thought it would be. Pick your battles. Take things one day at a time. Small goals are good. Read survivor stories. Find inspiration around you. These moments count too. Finding Hope...Finding Hope...Finding Hope... Think about what kind of coping skills work best for you. What about your spouse, or your child, how do they cope? Everyone copes differently, and recognizing this helps. You have to let people cope in the way that works best for them. I wish I'd have known how much stronger, not only myself, but my child would be for going through it all. You are stronger than you know. There certainly are no guarantees in life but putting yourself with the experts surely increases your odds. With a diagnosis as rare as HLH, the volume of patients treated in a center and thus the amount of experience a medical team has, matters immensely . I'd wish I would have known the sheer staggering numbers of platelets and transfusions and procedures that there would be in those first few months. I wish I would have known what a roller coaster ride it would be , doing poorly, doing well, worse again, and then better.
