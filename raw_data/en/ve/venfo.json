Modern Western medicine treats the symptoms to cure a diseased state when the body is out of homeostasis. Native American healing traditions do this as well with herbs and plants suited to the purpose. These Native healing traditions also include sacred rituals, chants, and purification rites to help bring the spirit and mind of the afflicted back into balance. In effect, treating the whole person, not only the disease. A blending of these two healing practices could bring about better prognoses for today's patients. The purpose of this paper is HEALTHCARE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE 1 Healthcare Considerations for the Native American Culture Christina Seif Mid-State Technical College HEALTHCARE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE 2 Abstract The Native American culture is the original culture of the United States. Members of Native American tribes live throughout the country. \"There are an estimated 4.9 million persons, in 565 federally recognized tribes who are classified as American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AI), alone or in combination with one or more other designated racial classifications. This demographic group compromises 1.6% of the U.S. population\" (Horowitz, 2012). Wisconsin is home to the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago), Ojibwa (Chippewa), and the Potawatomi tribes (\"American\", 2014). It is important for nurses within this state, as well as any other state, to understand the Native American belief system in order to provide a quality healthcare experience. Nurses are the primary point of contact in the healthcare setting. Client advocacy is one of the nurse's major roles. Therefore, the nurse should have the highest level of diversity understanding for the cultures within the local region. Traditional Cherokee medicine primarily focuses on the purity and wellbeing of the soul and assesses the physiological condition of the body as a secondary practice (Frazier, Goad, & Wolyniak, 2013). The Cherokee highly value the importance of man being in a harmonious balance with nature. An imbalance in nature is erosion of the Aboriginal culture.(chp.2). Restrictions placed on the cultural practices of the Aboriginal people ultimately led to the abatement of the Aboriginal traditional medicines.(p88). Losing their freedom to practice traditional therapeutics, the Aboriginal people eventually had to adapt to the culturally inappropriate ways of western medicines. The purpose of this paper is to examine the advantages of Aboriginal healing methods for the Aboriginal people, as well as to explain why these traditional methods continued to persist long after western style medicines were introduced. The Native American woman interviewed has a strong holistic approach when viewing medicine compared to Western civilization. Before seeking any medical attention she states she will first try teas, herbs and other supplements in soothing common ailments. She often bakes In this case study on cross cultural medicinal beliefs and practices, Anne Fadiman addresses the rift between Hmong spiritual and medicinal customs and the culture of American biomedicine by telling the story of a young Hmong child, Lia Lee. Lia's journey started when she was three months old and she suffered her first of many epileptic seizures. Over the next few months she continued to suffer from her seizures and made at least three emergency room visits. Like most cases of epilepsy, the cause of her grand mal seizures was unknown, however, her parents, Nao Kao and Foua Lee, believed it to be the result of her elder sister slamming the door and scaring Lia awake, allowing a dab, or evil spirit, to steal her soul. After her first visit to the Merced Community Medical Center, it became clear that the language barrier would not allow for an accurate patient history to be recorded. As Lia's condition worsened, this barrier would further prevent the Lee's from understanding exactly what was happening to their daughter as well as follow the treatment the doctors were implementing. This eventually lead to the doctor's believing that Nao Kao and Foua Culture is one of the most important parts of the life as spirituality. Native American, people practice many different ceremonies as a ritual, which represent their culture, such as, Sun Dance, healing ceremony, and Gallup ceremony, etc. The first ceremony that Native American celebrates the Sun Dance, which is also known as thanksgiving ceremony. This ceremony is like a vision dance. It is a ritual in which people stare at the sun, until everything blackout or spirit break in (Lecture notes). The other ceremony is Gallup ceremony, which is one of the major celebrations that Indian-Tribe celebrates. According to the text, \"The Gallup Ceremonial had been an annual event for a long time. It was good for the tourist, they liked to see Indians and Indian dances; they wanted a chance to buy Indian Jewelry and Navajo rugs. Every year it was organized by the white men there\" (111). It demonstrates that, how the Native people celebrate their ceremonies every year, with all the respect to their culture. The last ceremony is healing ceremony. Healing ceremony is the ritual that a female Pomo Shaman conducts a ritual healing ceremony over the man's body. She is performing the ancient doctoring to heal the man spiritually, in which she was dancing with a two sticks, chanting and rubbing her hand on the body (Lecture notes). As we compare, ancient and recent Native American cultures were almost the same because in the past, people celebrate the cultures with a very good sight to enjoy their rituals. Even though, now society has developed a lot, but values of traditions are not changed Similarly, American Indian Medicine believes that people are closely related to nature which is similar to Ayurveda culture. Also, the American Indian Medicine feels as the destiny of humanity, of trees, sky, and oceans are all associated. The treatments in American Indian Medicine include services and ceremonies. Another form of medicine is Curanderismo. It is a Mexican-American way of healing their societies. In Spanish, the verb \"curar\" means \"to heal.\" This form of medicine has three levels of treatment and they consist of spiritual, material and mental. African Medicine is related to American Indian Medicine as well as Ayurveda because they both use herbs and believe that they are linked to nature. African tribes treat people by seeking At first Europeans were skeptical of the medicine that the Native Americans used. Medicine men and women used new medical techniques that the Europeans never have seen before, they prayed to spirits and had ceremonies to heal some patients. Native American healers highly believed in spiritual healing that Europeans were not accustom to and did not believe in. However Europeans went crazy over the way Native Americans could use plants and herbs in healing. Native Americans doctors would go into the forest often not far from their homes and find plants, berries, barks, and roots that would be used in healing, although they have been known to go on trips for several days to collect materials too. Many herbs that Native Americans used in early colonial America are still used today like ginseng and bayberry. With the Native Americans knowledge of herbs and natural remedies many colonists were beginning to think that Native American medicine men and women were better doctors than their own educated European doctors. Natives Americans came along way from being savages. The Natives of California distinguish plants and animals into diverse locations of botany and zoology . They learn to cultivate throughout the views of animals and by creating a food chain that benefited the tribe. Many native tribes observed the environmental system that either made other species survive and extinct. The natives were considered to be curious about the environment they lived that prepared them want to learn, observe, and practice rituals. The natives were uninformed that religious ritual such as coordinating the sun and moon movement was practical rituals of much groundwork for collecting food and building supplies. Like many other American native groups they established and discover valuable properties of plants. Using kernels, plant roots, tree barks and herbal leaves as curative purposes. As the native embarked a lot of nature resources there were many that are ineffective and some are used in today's modern medicine. As stated above due to my mother's psotionality I have been exposed to both natural medicine and criticism on such views, but many others grew up with severely negative or dismissive teachings and views. This brought out a type of curiosity that only increased throughout my schooling, specifically what do people believe and what were they taught. Thus, the purpose of my paper is to discover what stereotypes are known and believed to be associated with Indigenous medicine and how does familiarity with the topic influence these views. The study looks at variables such as positionality as well as relationships to the teachings, allowing for an accurate depiction without making any assumptions. This will allow me to analyze with as little bias In Rupert Ross's novel, entitled, \"Indigenous Healing: Exploring Traditional Paths\", he explores the indigenous point of view. More specifically, Ross looks at the meaning of living relationally, the circular vison culture, the impacts of colonialism of the western world on First Nations people, as well as how to bring awareness to non-native people of the tragedies that Aboriginals have and are still going through. Art and Religion are utilized by Haitian culture for healing and survive in the Caribbean communities (Davis, Paravisini-Gebert, & Fernandez Olmos, 2004). \"Healing Cultures is more self-consciously pan-Caribbean in scope, sensitive not only to the region's historical intersections, but also taking into account the ways in which cultures rely on each other and are reinterpreted across borders\" (Davis et al., 2004, p. 1). The term \"Healing Arts\" is used to explain the cures utilized by Haitian culture for healing of illness that are physical, psychological and even spiritual (Davis et al., 2004). For instance the use vodou practices. Haitian vodou functions in the following way: \"offers a cultural construction of illness, provides elements Professional Communication Cultural Sensitivity Guide Cultural competence can be defined as using the ability of one's awareness, attitude, knowledge and skill to effectively interact with a patient's many cultural differences. Madeline Leininger, a pioneer on transcultural nursing describes it this way; \"a formal area of study and practice focused on An increasing number of medical schools are now offering courses in alternative medicine for their students, and some hospitals already have alternative medicine departments. The availability of healers and doctors practicing holistic medicine has also increased in recent years, and more and more people are educating themselves in these new fields. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that between 65 and 80 percent of the world's population (about 3 billion people) rely on traditional medicine as their primary form of health care. "}
