I am a board certified psychiatric nurse practitioner and certified integrative mental health provider. My integrative psychiatry appointment differs from a traditional psychiatry appointment in that it incorporates a more holistic approach to mental health and well-being. We will explore various aspects of your life, including physical health, lifestyle, nutrition, sleep patterns, stress levels, and social support systems in order to identify potential underlying causes or contributors to mental health concerns. My clinical areas of focus include depression, anxiety, panic, bipolar spectrum disorders, OCD, grief, PTSD, and sleep issues. Treatment options include holistic medicine, medication management, and supportive therapy. I'm also trained in Interpersonal and Social Rhythm therapy to help improve mood stability by working with biological/social rhythms. I believe the healing process begins with establishing a therapeutic alliance. I want to hear your story and want you to feel truly heard. Through an integrative approach, we will work together to create an individualized treatment plan that focuses on improving your overall well being. Take the first step to help.
