Some are essential and some are complementary, enhancing the overall state of vitality. One of the essential factors is the ability of our body to detoxify itself. In this process the body is either neutralising or expelling toxic compounds that are harmful for it. Exposure to toxic substances is unavoidable as they are present everywhere - in the air we breath, water we drink, food we eat. Also, a fair amount of toxins is generated inside the body as a result of the metabolic processes going within it. To detoxify and cleanse are natural functions and usually performed by the body effortlessly without additional help. However, when we get overloaded with toxic materials these essential tasks are turning into a struggle. At this point our body need support and assistance to ensure that all the unwanted substances are eliminated efficiently. If not, it is getting clogged and sluggish with consequences of developing further health problems.
