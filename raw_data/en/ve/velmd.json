This formulation is a liquid colloidal mineral supplement, enhancing its bio-availability to cells, tissues and organs. It does not burden a toxic or weak system, rather its collective energy defends against the negative strains of modern lifestyles. Current diets are lacking in vital nutrition. Much-needed resources help power the body and rejuvenate fragile or exhausted responses. The essence of holistic healthcare considers the overall picture and journey of every individual. Functional nutrition helps target a systematic response. The synergy of the ingredients also considers the foundational relationship the cells have with their external antagonists. This Whole Health tonic helps direct much-needed nourishment and stimulation on a basic nutritional level, which helps stabilize and prepare the body. But customers also appreciate its efficiency and strength-giving properties. Whole Health can be used as a stepping stone for energy, growth and improved resources. Its overall goal is to enhance the vitality of the body's innate immune system and support an environment experiencing debilitating health conditions. External elements, such as pathogens, toxicity and deficiency destabilize an effective immune system. Overtime, these factors weaken the entire functioning of a vitalized body. This supplement encourages an improved support structure for chronic unrest. It also offers an integral role helping address candida, flu and burn-out. It D3 and Beta-Glucan. Research suggests that long before clinical symptoms start to emerge, micronutrient deficiency can develop and spread, hampering a body's energetic spectrum. This product is ideal for at-risk groups such as children or students experiencing chronic stress, those with digestive problems or poor diet and clients experiencing sub-clinical stages of illness. This nutritional tool is best used in conjunction with Practitioner testing and works alongside homeopathy, naturopathy, kinesiology and bio resonance. It has been shown to stimulate cellular activity and increase energy and stamina. For symptomatic problems, when used alongside a Personalised Health Plan, it can also help with inflammation, aches, discomfort, fatigue and help the body be more resilient. This supplement is suitable for children (5 mls once daily) and adults (5 mls, twice daily), or as directed by the Practitioner. As with all healthcare supplements, it is best used in conjunction with a CAM Provider.

Often in the form of the aluminium salt, alum is ubiquitous as an additive in a myriad of products ranging from processed foods to cosmetics, medications and even our tap water. It's even in the air we breathe outside. Science shows that deposits of this toxic element builds up insidiously in the human body over time, especially in the brain. Fortunately, years of scientific research particularly in the U.K. has proven that regularly drinking natural silica-rich water like ACILIS by Spritzer ( that's SILICA backwards) helps remove aluminium in a harmless and non- invasive way. With chronic fatigue rife among millions across Britain, more than 250,000 have been diagnosed with the debilitating syndrome ME (Myalgic encephalomyelitis) for which there is no known cure or cause. With no known cause, toxicity is being suggested as a possible factor, and that's where proven detox water like ACILIS by Spritzer comes in. With its unique qualities also proven to promote softer skin, supple joints, stronger bones and hair, ACILIS by Spritzer silica-rich water is sourced from a aquifer 400ft beneath protected rainforest in the rainiest part of tropical Malaysia. Bottled at source in a state-of-art bottling plant, ACILIS is made available in the UK exclusively by [Silicawaters.com](https://www.silicawaters.com/), a certified Not-for-Profit Social Enterprise, which also supports those with neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and autism, with special money saving discounts on silicawater.

How EMFs Affect the Body and Brain - and How their Effect can be Rebalanced Electricity and magnetism are forces that are fundamental to the nature of the universe and life. The earth\u00b4s electromagnetic field surrounds and protects all living things with a natural frequency pulsation of, on average, 7.83 hertz - the so-called \"Schumann resonance.\" The 7.83 hertz frequency also happens to be the dominant frequency of brain waves - known as \"alpha waves\" - that correspond with an adult in a relaxed state. This frequency range is also associated with creativity, overall mental and body/mind coordination, calmness, alertness and learning. Albert Einstein said: \"Everything in life is vibration.\" Our nervous system operates in response to electrical signals, and scientific research shows that all living organisms respond to the subtlest changes in the magnetic and electromagnetic fields surrounding us. Electromagnetic fields affect electrical conduction. With the rapid introduction of electricity into many areas of our ordinary lives, the potential for Electromagnetic Field (EMF) exposure has increased exponentially. EMFs are created wherever electricity is generated, transmitted or utilised. The introduction of 4G and 5G mobile technology (5G ranges between 600MHz and 40GHz - or, to spell it out, 600,000,000 hertz to 40,000,000,000 hertz) is unarguably having a significant influence on the inherent human electrical signaling system on which our physical and mental health depends. Research into EMF radiation indicates that even those who suffer no obvious ill effects may still be affected at a subtle level, while sensitive individuals may have one or more ailments, such as stomach aches, headaches, muscle pains and poor sleep, or harder to diagnose symptoms that are difficult to treat because few physicians are familiar with the underlying causes. Many devices are now available that claim to protect against EMFs. One of the most thoroughly tested technologies is available through the PRANAN family of protection products. Several scientific studies[1] have documented their ability to stabilize various physiological processes when exposed to EMFs. How does the Pranan Technology Work? Pranan technology does not attempt to absorb or block electromagnetic radiation, which is impossible. Instead, by capturing part of the ambient radiation, it filters out the transverse components, only allowing the longitudinal components to pass through, converting them into ultra-weak electromagnetic pulses - thus producing a balancing effect at the cellular and bioelectrical level from the alterations caused by EMFs. Since the Pranan range of action of devices reaches 300 GHz, protection against 5G is assured. What's more, they have an unlimited lifetime[2] and are maintenance-free.

The potential of many standard food supplements is often not fully realized because of the numerous challenges that they face as they travel through the harsh environment of the gut. Liposomal vitamin developments are exciting, however, some companies have put profit before integrity and produced poor quality supplements masquerading as liposomal. This issue was highlighted in a recent Advertising Standards Agency ruling on Nov 4th 2021 against a well-known brand who were unable to substantiate their liposomal claims [https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/yourzooki-ltd-a20-1083951-yourzooki-ltd.html](https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/yourzooki-ltd-a20-1083951-yourzooki-ltd.html) LivOn Labs who developed Altrient, the world's first liposomal vitamin C have been leading the way in research and formulation of liposomal vitamin supplements since the early 2000s taking quality very seriously. They adhere to some of the most demanding safety and quality standards in the industry and use a patented process to make their liposomal products. It is hard to spot a true liposomal product as this aspect of the food supplement industry is currently unregulated. Many supposed liposomal vitamin supplements are nothing more than phospholipid vitamin emulsions, misleadingly labelled as liposomal, with none of the absorption benefits that a true liposomal product delivers. When shopping for liposomal supplements caution is needed. There has recently been a rise in brands marketing liposomal products that have no liposomes in them at all. True liposomal supplements are proven to provide maximized absorption of the nutrients they hold. To identify a real bilayer liposome you need to look at a product under a powerful microscope, but there are some things to ask for and look out for that will help ensure you are getting the real benefits of liposomal delivery: - Ask brands and retailers for evidence to prove they are genuine - Ask to see proof of liposomes in the form of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis. This is the only way to be able to clearly see and define the bilayer structure of the liposomes. - A Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analysis will not be able to tell you whether a product contains liposomes or not. - Look into the manufacturer's testing procedures and independent clinical trials - Look into the manufacturer's quality assurance - third party verification - Should contain a high content of phosphatidylcholine (there are different qualities of phosphatidylcholine, which will affect the stability of liposomes) - A watery product would suggest that there are not enough phospholipids in the product or that the quality of the phospholipids is not up to standard to make liposomes - Ideally should be liquid or gel - Ideally should come in a single-dose sachet rather than a bottle to reduce oxidation - If you have determined that the product is indeed liposomal, you then need to ask for proof that the liposomes actually contain vitamin C!

Not only is insomnia increasing due to the global crisis, but we also have a new type of insomnia now coined the pandemic insomnia, which is on the rise and increasing. Insomnia is caused by various factors such as anxiety, stress, emotional and psychological issues, and overall environmental and social pressures. We live in an atmosphere of fear, and restrictions, whether perceived or actual. The result is a build-up of physical and emotional tensions, so much so that it's difficult to relax and fall asleep naturally by the end of the day. The art of sleep is to stay calm, balanced, and centred in order to maintain healthy regenerative sleep during these unprecedented times. Flower Essences Come to the Rescue! Calm and Relax from the Flowers of Australia and Norway Rediscover one's natural sleep rhythm and regain regenerative sleep with our go-to remedy for calming the mind and emotions when feeling stressed, nervous, angst, worried, overextended, and panicked. It helps to bring a state of homeostasis. Listening to your internal dialog is beneficial for managing your stress levels. This remedy is perfect for the inability to sleep well and wake up refreshed; it creates an emotional and mental calm and the ability to relax deeply, and be stress-free. Contains: Black-eyed Susan, Bush Fuchsia, Crowea, Jacaranda, Paw, Bottlebrush, Old Man Banksia, Hibiscus, and Valerian. It's all about our circadian rhythms, our internally driven cycles that rise and fall during the day. The master circadian clock in the brain is in control of the physical, mental, and behavioural changes that follow a 24-hour cycle. These natural processes respond primarily to light and dark cycles and help us fall asleep at night, and wake up in the morning. An unhealthy lifestyle can trigger or perpetuate erratic sleep patterns, and these habits can lead to insomnia. Working at home in the evenings with wifi, computers etc., makes it hard to unwind, being preoccupied when it comes time to sleep and missing the window when the body signals it wants to sleep. Neurotransmitters - have a significant function in sleep rhythms. These chemical messengers within the brain allow communication between nerve cells - involved with sleep and wakefulness. Your pineal gland works as a motion detector for the light and dark cycles. Approximately 95% of your serotonin comes from the gut. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter known as the happiness, feel-good hormone. Melatonin is produced in the pineal gland and is an ancient molecule that can be traced back to the origin of life, known as the hormone of darkness. Both dopamine and serotonin are referred to as \"feel good\" chemicals due to their roles in regulating mood and emotion. Imbalances of these chemicals can cause different medical conditions. Low dopamine levels have been linked to depression; low serotonin levels can contribute to mood, sleep, issues. When out of balance, chemical interactions in the brain can interfere with sleep patterns, which explains why some are biologically prone to insomnia and struggle with sleep for many years without any identifiable cause, even when following healthy sleep advice. They may be a deficiency in serotonin - often referred to as the happy hormone as it people with depression; its deficiency has also been linked to anxiety and insomnia. Resetting the Circadian Rhythms and Sleep Pattern with Zero In Which contains a most valued ingredient Mucuna pruriens, or velvet bean, is a tropical legume that boosts dopamine levels. This \"magical bean\" has been used for thousands of years in Ayurvedic medicine. It is being researched for improving depression, sleep patterns. It is also known as the \"dopamine bean\" since it is a good source of L-Dopa (4 - 7%), from which dopamine is made in the body. Said to be referred to as Jack's magic beans in the fairytale, called \"magical velvet beans.\" This \"magic\" refers to Mucuna's potential to improve brain health for researchers. For users, this bean's \"magical properties\" span from its alleged aphrodisiac effects, while others yet allude to the plant's subjective simultaneously relaxant and stimulating effects. Is an effective mood enhancer and antidepressant due to its high levels of naturally occurring L-dopa. The precursor to dopamine and the key neurotransmitter in the brain for coordinating body movements, learning, regulating moods, and increasing motivation. It also has a neo-protective and free radical scavenging action. Zero In the Velvet Bean synergically combined with N- acetyl l-tyrosine is a precursor for neurotransmitter dopamine uptake, allowing better bioavailability to supply the brain. It protects from the harmful effects of all forms of stress. All of which goes a long way to take back control of our body's innate ability to take care of itself.

When encountering the \"shedding\" of graphene oxide and other nano particles, we are all affected with these toxins sprayed (from chem-trails and geo-engineering)from above and on our crops and fed to us in our foods fluoridated water, dental products/treatments etc.). This unique blend is a powerful and gorgeous 'combo' of powerful essential oils and monoatomic gold. I have created this NEW unique synergy, working with the advice of a team of Kinesiologists (also independent practitioners) here in the UK. The Kinesiologists tell me that with their muscle testing for the \"Collective\", this cream could also positively impact and help to balance and/or remove energetic blockages hence promoting balance for the [cosmic](https://www.organic-aromatherapy.co.uk/cosmic), [third eye](https://www.organic-aromatherapy.co.uk/third-eye) and [crown](https://www.organic-aromatherapy.co.uk/crown) chakras. This is a wonderful surprise to me! The basic blend has been tested and tried for many years, consisting of juniper, melissa, oregano, melaleuca (tea tree), lavender, clary sage, pine and peppermint essential oils of the highest therapeutic grade available on the planet. It also includes pine and spruce essential oils (Shikimic acid, suramin). To this NEW \"Protection\" blend, I have also added essential oils of star anise, Siberian Fir and a little fennel and then blended in some monoatomic gold, ormus and LOVE. These delicious characters are all wrapped up in a beautiful pure vegan base cream of purest white. Like all my other creams, this new synergy is created by me, by hand, in a sacred space overlighted by the master angels and my amazing powerful \"spiritual team\". The blend has been tested by a panel of independent therapists, teachers and students, along with some of their patients and clients. I apply mine several times a day (especially if I am out and about, or seeing clients). I keep a pot in the car too, to use before and after shopping (touching shopping trolleys, etc) and mixing with the public. I'm always dabbing a blob on my darling hubby too and the dogs get a good sniff and a stroke when I have applied mine, so I feel I am looking after my family as best I can. The importance of following a healthy protocol, which addresses all four bodies: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. This encompasses a vegan or plant-based diet daily (locally grown, seasonal) and clean structured and unfluoridated water (not from plastic bottles) is a good way to support the natural detoxification of your body. Pure positive thoughts help to clear your emotional and mental bodies. Meditation, breathing into the lower third of your lungs (3-4-5 breathing practice/Buddha breath), all assist in putting us in a positive state, enabling the clearance and rebalancing of a healthy body (homeostasis).

Homeopaths, unless medically qualified, do not diagnose health conditions. They are trained to choose a homeopathic remedy that closely matches the symptoms presented by the person suffering, after all whilst there may be similarities in some ailments, it is the unusual symptom that can be the key to the most appropriate homeopathic remedy. My online course Homeopathy at Home is designed to teach you how to use homeopathic remedies for minor ailments such as coughs, colds, headaches and sore throats etc. Beginning with a brief introduction of the history of homeopathy and how remedies are made, it covers a number of homeopathic remedies along with questions to ask and some notes to help you differentiate between similar remedies. Once you have decided upon the remedy instructions are given on how the remedies should be taken and how often they should be repeated. It is worth noting that homeopathic remedies are non-toxic, non-addictive and safe for all ages, unlike some over-the-counter medications where you may be advised not to operate machinery or drive due to the possibility of becoming drowsy. Homeopathic remedies can be purchased from local health stores. If, after completing the Homeopathy at Home course you feel that you would like to develop your knowledge further, the Homeopathic Practitioner Diploma course, offers you an in-depth apprenticeship style study course spread over three years. This course further explores the philosophy of homeopathy, differentiating between acute and chronic cases and preparing case studies. You will be required to put aside time for self-study and written assignments. Once all the necessary criteria have been completed you will be entitled to register as a homeopathic practitioner and take steps to build your career as a homeopath. I am also pleased to note that I am now a recognized practitioner of NutriClean, Gut Transformation and Peri-Menopause nutritional health Programmes. With the aid of nutritional supplementation and homeopathy I enjoy working with people and seeing their health improve and the longer-term benefits of staying healthy. My practice is in Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex but for clients where distance or time constraints could be an issue, I am happy to hold consultations via Zoom, Skype, Facetime, etc. Further Information For further details on any of the above, please telephone 01621 730664 or email me at [june@betterhealthnow.co.uk](mailto:june@betterhealthnow.co.uk) or visit [www.homeopathinessex.co.uk](http://www.homeopathinessex.co.uk) and please mention Positive Health when making contact. Health-e-Learning - Green Living Health and the Environment It's time to 'green' the people...Let's get human health placed as high on the environmental agenda as the threat to the animals, plants and planet\" Dr Rosy Daniel, Project Leader, Health and Wellbeing Trust Charity According to Cancer Research UK our lifetime risk of cancer has now risen from 1 in 3 to 1 in 2! That means that half of us can now expect to get the diagnosis of this largely incurable illness along with the extremely expensive medical solutions of chemo- and radiotherapy, which are in themselves carcinogenic. The huge rise in cancer levels being caused by genetic mutation and disordered cell growth indicates that our health is breaking down as fast and dangerously as the breakdown in our planetary ecology. The relationship with cancer and the environment is fundamental. The micro-environment of our cells and genes entirely reflects the macro-environment in which we live, eat, breathe, drink, sleep and work. The disruptive toxic environmental effects of persistent chemicals, hormone disruptors, carcinogens in food, household, gardening and beauty products, poor food, water and air quality are augmented by the damage caused by non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation, low-density electromagnetic fields and sick buildings. These physical threats to physical health are being experienced along with the emotional impact of eco-anxiety, depression and despair causing pandemic levels of mental illness, existential angst and suicide. Stress, anxiety and depression are proven to disrupt our immunity; immune dysregulation is associated at one end with cancer and raised risk of infection and at the other in increased allergies and autoimmune diseases. Picture of Green; To do the exercise link to [https://pictureofgreen.healthcreation.co.uk/request_code.php](https://pictureofgreen.healthcreation.co.uk/request_code.php) The Green Living Project The Health and Wellbeing Trust exists to promote 'Sustainable healthcare solutions for the 21st century' through online health-e-learning and health-e-information platforms'. In these times of ecological fragility and toxic threat to people, plants, animals and planet it is vital that we all change our behavior, consumer habits and self-care as a matter of urgency. Environmental toxicity is at the root of cancer, lung disease, allergies, fatigue and endocrine disorders and it is vital that we now 'green the people' as well as the planet! The Picture of Green - 'Coming over to the green side' The Picture of Green has been created as an awareness raising tool for individuals; its use will be combined with a gentle fundraising request for donations to the Trust. Individuals are invited to check out how green they are currently living by answering online 12 awareness raising questions in 12 environmental domains. Each question will have a 10-point Likert Scale which creates a spider graph and a numerical score known as 'The Green Living Factor'. There will then be signposting from each question to help users find help or guidance to make positive changes and buy products to move fully towards Clean Green Living.

There could be another way chlorella could help our immune systems this winter however. It's thought that long term stress suppresses our immune system, making us more prone to getting ill. Researchers[1] have found that chlorella may affect part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which plays a big role in how we react to stress. It was discovered that the algae appears able to reduce the amount by which the hypothalamus activates part of the body's stress system; resulting in less activity by a specific stress hormone, called adrenocorticotropic hormone. Whilst this wasn't a human study, the scientists concluded that the research helped reinforce the concept that chlorella has an ability 'to diminish the impact of stressors'; ultimately that under stressful conditions the body doesn't get as stressed. Which Chlorella? Sun Chlorella is one of the world's most popular brands (although it should be noted that the study above used a different species of chlorella to that used by Sun Chlorella) as they use something called DYNO\u00ae-Mill technology when creating their supplements. This breaks down the cell wall of the algae, without the use of heat or chemicals which can reduce the quality of the chlorella, to ensure when you use their products you're getting the most nutrients possible. Sun Chlorella is available in both granule form, to be added to smoothies and shakes, and as tablets. Reference - axis and brain c-fos expression. Psychoneuroendocrinology: 65:1-8. Epub Dec 4. 2015.
