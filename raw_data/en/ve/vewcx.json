Read our [disclosure here.](https://thehealthyconsultant.com/disclosure/#affiliate-links) Stop guessing which products are truly non-toxic, safe to use, and better for the environment. I've rounded up the top non-toxic cleaning products in every category of the home, so that you can make an easy switch to safer cleaning products. After [struggling with hormones](https://thehealthyconsultant.com/my-skin-story-how-i-naturally-cleared-my-acne/), and gut issues, I decided to make some major changes in my environment. One of the most important ones I made was switching to non-toxic and safe cleaning products. I was the one who used Clorox wipes, Febreze, candles, and toxic laundry detergent (that left me constant skin irritation and rashes), like it was my job. I had no idea the products I was using was harmful to my health, the environment, and my poor dog. Making the switch was fairly easy, but knowing which products were actually safe to use, was not. There are so many products out there claiming they are \"natural\" and \"Eco-friendly\", however when I investigated further they were far from it. Contents How Do I Know If My Cleaning Products Are Safe? A good start to knowing if your cleaning products is to visit [EWG.org's Guide to Healthy Cleaning.](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/) After you find your product you can then click on it to see its scoring factors. Each product ingredient will be listed out with a list of concerns as well. EWG scores products based on [four questions](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/content/faq/#q6). - Does the product contain hazardous substances? - Do we know all the ingredients? - Do other factors come into play? - How does this product rate overall? At this time this is the best way to know if your cleaning products are safe. You can also search products on the website by category such as: bathroom, kitchen, and laundry to find out the best cleaners for your specific needs. Where To Buy Natural Cleaning Products I stick to getting my natural cleaning products from [Branch Basics](https://branchbasics.com/shop/starter-kit-oxygen-boost/?utm_source=thehealthyconsultant.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=favorites) ( [$10 off](http://branchbasics.refr.cc/thehealthyconsultant) using my code), Thrive Market ( [my review here](https://thehealthyconsultant.com/thrive-market-review-and-my-favorite-products/)), and Amazon. I've found that a lot of big box stores such as Target or Walmart don't carry safe cleaning products. \"Natural\" Doesn't Mean Non-Toxic Watch out for marketing. If you see words on the packaging like: this doesn't mean the product is safe to use. Unfortunately, there are no federal regulations over the ingredients in cleaning supplies. [Companies can use any ingredients they want in their products, even those known to pose health or environmental hazards](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/content/weak_regulation/), AND they don't have to disclose that information to consumers. If you look at the ingredients list in the cleaning products you have in your household right now, there probably isn't one! Cleaning products are not required by federal law to disclose a list of ingredients. Some companies have started to list the ingredients on their website, however you aren't able to see them at the store. This is a serious issue because most cleaning products contain chemicals that are linked to cancer, can cause asthma attacks, and severe skin rashes. Top Products To Avoid [EWG recommends](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/content/findings/) avoiding the products below because they are not necessary and are no safer than the alternatives. - Air Fresheners - Air wick, Glade plug-ins, candles, febreze, Bath and Body works products, etc. Stay away from air fresheners as they contain secret fragrance mixture that can trigger allergies and asthma. Don't buy any product that has the word or ingredient \"fragrance\" on it. Instead of using air fresheners I stick with diffusing [essential oils](https://www.amazon.com/Edens-Garden-Essential-Aromatherapy-Therapeutic/dp/B07Y44CQTQ?content-id=amzn1.sym.c8697a08-4071-4b95-a6c6-18057bcdb898%3Aamzn1.sym.c8697a08-4071-4b95-a6c6-18057bcdb898&crid=2R11HUXQYWRO6&cv_ct_cx=Eden%27s+Garden%27s+Essential+Oils&keywords=Eden%27s+Garden%27s+Essential+Oils&pd_rd_i=B07Y44CQTQ&pd_rd_r=a6d42a6d-8a17-4c8c-a82f-b07c6a1d4221&pd_rd_w=jNb5t&pd_rd_wg=0unnK&pf_rd_p=c8697a08-4071-4b95-a6c6-18057bcdb898&pf_rd_r=T0QA338ZEJNYZQAM3ZBX&qid=1682385636&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sprefix=eden%27s+garden%27s+essential+oils%2Caps%2C131&sr=1-1-364cf978-ce2a-480a-9bb0-bdb96faa0f61-spons&psc=1&smid=A3PKW778P6JAD9&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExWUkzWlNDUkpVMTVBJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTEwNDgwMjBCT0s2MVlOSlhHMCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNzExNzA0MjZRMjJHSFJZRjlZTCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX3NlYXJjaF90aGVtYXRpYyZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU%3D&linkCode=ll1&tag=thehealthyc04-20&linkId=de990a1f54a598ba535c081e25ce7bf4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)in an essential - Antibacterial (antiseptic, or antimicrobial) Products - Lysol, Dial Soap, Mr. Clean, Clorox, Dawn, Purell, Method, etc. Many of these products contain Triclosan which is harmful to the immune system and endocrine system. Stay away from these products unless you have a specific medical condition. [Antibacterial products can spur development of drug-resistant superbugs](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/content/findings/). Remember these products are no better at eliminating bacteria than plain soaps, or detergents. A good alternative is using a non toxic hand soap to wash your hands. Hand soaps should be [without the ingredients:](https://www.forceofnatureclean.com/finding-non-toxic-hand-soaps/)\"fragrance\", preservatives such - Fabric Softener and Dryer Sheets - The chemicals in dryer sheets and fabric softeners are considered the most toxic of household cleaning products. [They contain pernicious chemicals combined with a hefty dose of fragrance](https://branchbasics.com/blog/12-toxic-chemicals-in-dryer-sheets-fabric-softeners/). Anything that you put on your body enters through your skin, and gets into your body. You might as well be eating the chemicals. They contain chemicals that are known to cause cancer, damage lungs, brain and nerves. A good alternative to fabric softener is adding 1/2-1 cup [baking soda](https://www.amazon.com/Prescribed-Life-Natural-Sodium-Bicarbonate/dp/B00NPS6U76?crid=2S8VM4R3S9LSS&keywords=organic%2Bbaking%2Bsoda&qid=1682385446&sprefix=organicbaking%2Bsoda%2Caps%2C82&sr=8-1-spons&smid=A2PLP4BOVOPKB4&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVTRNWThQT0M3SkpOJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjU0MjIxMkdBQ1U0TTFYUFBaSiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjU3NTc2VzNRMkFDMEFUM0pMJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=thehealthyc04-20&linkId=f81c6d6a7564ab20e08938e853399f79&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)to your washing machine.

The Best Non-Toxic Cleaning Products Non-Toxic Laundry Products Everything you wash and dry eventually touches your skin, so it is extremely important to use a non toxic laundry detergent. Commercial detergents are loaded with chemicals that are harmful to your health, pets, and environment. Not only are fabric softeners and dryer sheets one of the most toxic household cleaning products (see above), but they are also unnecessary.
