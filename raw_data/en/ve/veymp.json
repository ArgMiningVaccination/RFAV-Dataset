Most people have never heard about naturopathic medicine and find it hard to believe that such a remarkable form of medicine could even exist in the first place. Getting to the deeper cause Naturopathic medicine is a growing field in medicine that seeks to understand the cause of illness, using conventional science and traditional medicine. What makes naturopaths different is their approach to the patient. We look at the whole person experiencing the illness, across their entire lifetime, within the body, mind, and environment. And for treatment, naturopaths use therapies that build the body's ability to heal itself while also directly addressing symptoms. Level of education Naturopathic Doctors licensed as ND or NMD are trained in both conventional and alternative medicine to offer primary care and a large variety of specialty medicine. Accredited naturopathic medical schools spend 4-6 years in a rigorous basic and clinical science, and do extensive training in specialties. Naturopathic education emphasizes physiology and biochemistry more than any other form of medicine, allowing the naturopath to solve complex problems that present in each patient uniquely. Naturopathic Doctors look to modern science to inform their clinical decisions, and use the safest and most effective methods to produce a cure, first using natural methods like herbal medicine, nutrition, physical medicine, and homeopathy. Then in licensed states naturopathic doctors or physicians prescribe drugs and are trained to refer patients within the medical system. Spending time with your doctor Naturopathic visits may last from 30 to 120 minutes, with most of that time spent in direct contact with the doctor. It is important for the doctor to spend the time to listen to each patient in order to uncover what makes them unique - and then educate that unique individual in healthy lifestyle choices for them. This means that patients walk away from each visit with the satisfaction of being heard. Patients develop deep relationships with their naturopathic doctor that last over their entire lifetime.
