Since my return to Einstein, we've faced enormous challenges, mostly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But we have also experienced tremendous success\u2014 hitting record numbers in National Institutes of Health funding, hiring more than 40 faculty members to staff the Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center, and, just this year, receiving the second-largest gift in the College of Medicine's long and distinguished history. Additionally, Einstein became a fully accredited and independent degree-granting medical school, revamped the medical school cur - riculum, recruited outstanding people to key leadership positions, and reorganized its basic science departments (page 2). In yet another success story, this issue's cover article, \"Healing Child and Teen Mental Health,\" describes the many research and community programs that Einstein and Montefiore have launched to address mental-health challenges in the Bronx (page 28). Drug development is another area where we're making important advanc - es. Four Einstein scientists, working in tandem with our office of biotechnology and business development, have devel - oped treatments for conditions including Ebola, osteoarthritis, and cancer that are now in clinical trials (page 44). For me, the successful end of this academic year is bittersweet because A Message From the Dean GORDON F . TOMASELLI, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M.

On a sadder note, the magazine pays tribute to my dear longtime friend and fellow Einstein T rustee Emily Fisher Landau , whom we lost at the end of March. She funded the establishment of the Fisher Landau Center for the T reatment of Learning Disabilities at Einstein in 1997, and I was proud to become its founding director. She and I developed a lasting friendship over the years, in part because of our shared passion for helping people with learn - ing difficulties. She was one of the most extraordinary individuals I've ever met. You can learn more about her remark - able life on page 68. Finally, I'd like to recognize Dean Gordon Tomaselli, M.D. '82 , who has served the College of Medicine with many transformative accomplishments over these past five years. Some of the highlights of the dean's tenure can be found on pages 2 and 3. As he enters the next phase of his career, I know he will remain committed to Einstein, and I thank him for the exemplary job he has done at the College of Medicine.T he year has been off to a won - derful start at the College of Medicine. In January we learned of a major new gift from Evelyn Gruss Lipper, M.D. '71 , to create Einstein's Integrated Imaging Program for Cancer Research. This funding will help inves - tigators translate their laboratory find - ings into clinical tools for diagnosing and treating life-threatening metastatic cancers. Over the past two decades, Dr. Lipper's gifts have helped make Einstein a leader in using advanced imaging to study how complex diseases begin and progress in the human body. You can read more about the valuable work she supports beginning on page 10. Another important aspect of scientific investigation is highlighted in our article about mentorship, which is essential for developing the next generation of researchers. It describes the collaborations among five groups of mentors and mentees across the educational spectrum at Einstein, and how their work is benefiting both the scientists and their trainees (page 20). In this issue of Einstein magazine, you'll also learn about the recent work of our Board of T rustees, including: The addition of T rustee Raja Flores, M.D. '92 (page 9), who has established an endowed need-based scholarship for medical students, in part because he was inspired by a matching-grant program (page 56).

MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 910 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023Over the last two decades, gifts from Evelyn Gruss Lipper, M.D. '71, have helped make the College of Medicine a leader in using advanced imaging to study how complex diseases get started and progress in the human body. Now Dr. Lipper's family philanthro - py, the EGL Charitable Foundation, has made a major new gift to create Ein - stein's Integrated Imaging Program for Cancer Research (IIPCR). The gift will help investigators at Einstein and Mon - tefiore Einstein Cancer Center translate their laboratory research findings into clinical tools for diagnosing and treating metastatic cancers (in which tumor cells have spread beyond the primary tumor). \"Dr. Lipper's visionary generosity pro - vides a path for bringing basic-science advances to bear on intractable disease,\" says Gordon F . Tomaselli, M.D., the Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean at Einstein and executive vice president and chief academic officer at Montefiore. \"With her support, promising Einstein discoveries will be transformed into effective treatments, with the goal of improving cancer care.\" THE ROLE OF OBSERVATION When Dr. Lipper decided to support research at her alma mater, she focused on imaging\u2014a decision influenced by her own professional experience as well as by her interest in the use of new technology to improve health outcomes. \"In science, observation is critical to understanding,\" she says. \"I took up that theme and went with it.\" Dr. Lipper's initial gift to Einstein, in 2000, was instrumental in establishing the Gruss Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC). Einstein scientists could now use magnetic resonance imag - ing (MRI)\u2014a noninvasive imaging tool involving powerful magnets and radio waves\u2014to open a window onto metabo - lism, structure, and function.

Biophotonics uses photons (light particles) to examine and manipulate living systems, allowing insights at the molecular level into cell function in health and disease. The potential of biophotonics as an imaging tool inspired Dr. Lipper to make a second major gift to Einstein, establishing the Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Center (GLBC) in 2006. CATALYZING COLLABORATIONS \"To take this work to the next level, we really needed to combine MRI with multiphoton optical imaging\u2014which would require a substantial investment in equipment and personnel,\" says John Condeelis, Ph.D., the Judith and Bur - ton P . Resnick Chair in T ranslational Research, professor of cell biology and of surgery, scientific director of the Analyt - ical Imaging Facility, and chair emeritus of anatomy and structural biology at Einstein. In 2012, responding to the need, the EGL Charitable Foundation provided funds to establish Einstein's Integrated Imaging Program (IIP), co-directed by Dr. Condeelis, Robert Singer, Ph.D., and Craig Branch, Ph.D. Over the years, the IIP spurred numerous advances, particularly in understanding how breast cancer cells spread to distant organs, and it achieved its aim of encouraging research collab - orations between the MRRC and the GLBC. By the end of 2021, it became clear that something else was needed: a way to move basic-science discoveries into the clinic. IMPROVING PATIENT CARE The EGL Charitable Foundation stepped in once again, providing funds to create Einstein's IIPCR, which will open later this year under the direc -tion of Dr. Condeelis. This latest gift will expand the imaging team's research portfolio to include lung and pancreatic cancers and involve investigators from fields including radiology, oncology, surgery, pathology, veterinary medicine, and epidemiology. \"Dr. Lipper's extraordinary vision, per - sistence, and generosity are an inspiration to all of us in the translational research community,\" says Dr. Condeelis. \"She's a shining example of how the combined efforts of our research and philanthropic communities can address major health - care challenges and ultimately improve the health of our community.\" Adds Dr. Lipper, \"Perhaps the most important lesson I've learned as a philanthropist is that it's not simply a matter of giving money away. You want to give it effectively and make an impact. What could be better than advancing medical technologies that improve people's health?\"\"[Dr. Lipper] is a shining example of how the combined efforts of our research and philanthropic communities can address major healthcare challenges and ultimately improve the health of our community.\" \u2014 DR.

Their in - troduction a decade ago marked a major advance in cancer therapy, but only 10% to 30% of treated patients experience long-term improvement. In a paper published in November 2022 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , Xingxing Zang, M.Med., Ph.D., and colleagues presented findings that could bolster the effectiveness of immune-checkpoint therapy. Dr. Zang is the Louis Goldstein Swan Chair in Women's Cancer Research and a profes - sor of microbiology & immunology, of oncology, of medicine, and of urology at Einstein and a member of the Cancer Therapeutics Program at Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center. TELLING FRIEND FROM FOE The surfaces of immune cells are stud - ded with receptors called \"checkpoint\" proteins. By recognizing the body's \"self\" proteins, checkpoint receptors prevent T cells from attacking the body's normal cells. Most types of cancer cells cunningly express \"self-like\" proteins that can bind with checkpoint proteins, tricking im - mune cells into standing down and not attacking tumors. Current checkpoint inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies designed to short-circuit immune-cell/cancer-cell interactions by blocking either the tumor proteins or the T-cell receptors that bind with tumor proteins. Their limited effec - tiveness prompted Dr. Zang and other scientists to look at checkpoint path - ways involving natural killer (NK) cells, which\u2014like T cells\u2014play major roles in eliminating unwanted cells. A cancer-cell protein called PVR soon captured their attention. PVR protein is usually absent from or very scarce in normal tissues, but is found in abundance on many types of tumors. Moreover, PVRs appeared to inhibit T-cell and NK-cell activity by binding to a checkpoint protein called TIGIT\u2014prompting efforts to inter - rupt the TIGIT/PVR pathway by using monoclonal antibodies made against TIGIT. However, several clinical studies, including two large phase 3 clinical trials, have recently failed to improve cancer outcomes.THE ROLE OF A NEW RECEPTOR Meanwhile, the cancer-cell protein PVR was found to have another \"bind - ing partner\" on NK cells: \"We hypothesized PVR suppresses NK-cell activity not by binding with TIGIT but by binding with the recently recognized KIR2DL5,\" says Dr. Zang. To find out, he and his colleagues synthesized a monoclonal antibody targeting KIR2DL5. In studies involving humanized animal models of several types of human cancers, the researchers showed that their monoclonal antibody against KIR2DL5\u2014by blocking the KIR2DL5/ PVR pathway\u2014allowed NK cells to vig - orously attack and shrink human tumors and prolong animal survival. A Promising Immunotherapy Finding Freeing up immune cells to attack tumors: The tumor protein PVR (orange arrow) has \"turned off\" a natural killer (NK) cell by binding with its checkpoint receptor protein KIR2DL5 (green). The new checkpoint inhibitor (red triangle) has blocked the NK cell's KIR2DL5 protein, preventing PVR from inactivating the NK cell. 3 With the checkpoint inhibitor protecting the NK cell from PVR, the NK cell can now attack the tumor cell. 1 3 2 NK cellPVR KIR2DL5Checkpoint inhibito rTumor cell death Tumor cellNK 3 Illustration by Tatyana Starikova HarrisRESEARCHNOTESMAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 13Too Much 'Good' Cholesterol Can Be Bad for Certain Patients In a large clinical trial comparing four drugs commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D), researchers from around the country, including at Einstein and Montefiore, found that insulin glargine U-100 and liraglu - tide performed the best of four drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to maintain blood glu - cose levels in the recommended range. Blood glucose management is crucial for keeping people with T2D healthy. All four evaluated drugs were added to treatment with metformin, the first-line drug for treating T2D. Their findings were published on - line on Sept. 21, 2022, in a pair of papers in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM ). Jill Crandall, M.D., professor of medicine and the Jacob A. and Jeanne E. Barkey Chair in Medicine at Einstein, and chief of endocrinolo - gy at Einstein and Montefiore, was a coauthor on one of the NEJM papers.Two Diabetes Drugs Outperform OthersHDL cholesterol (HDL-C) has for decades been considered \"good\" cholesterol, confer - ring beneficial effects by removing other forms of cholesterol from the bloodstream. In the October 2022 issue of Hypertension , Gaetano Santulli, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues published the first study examining the relationship between HDL-C and cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. They found that high circulating levels of HDL cholesterol significantly in - creased the risk of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients. The study involved more than 11,000 people with hypertension who were followed for more than 25,000 person-years. Participants were divided into three groups: low HDL (HDL less than 40 mg/dL), medium HDL (HDL between 40 and 80 mg/ dL), and high HDL (HDL greater than 80 mg/dL). Compared with the medium- HDL group, the low-HDL group\u2014 as expected\u2014was at greater risk for cardiovascular events, but, remark - ably, the high-HDL group also faced a significantly increased risk. The results suggest that algorithms now used to calculate cardiovascular risk should be revised to take high- HDL cholesterol levels into consid - eration.

LaFave, Ph.D., studies lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of lung cancer. After earning her doctorate in cancer biology at the Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences in Manhattan, Dr. LaFave completed a post - doctoral fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. In 2021, she joined the Einstein faculty, where she is an assistant professor of cell biology and a member of the Stem Cell & Cancer Biology Program at Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center. Starting a lab is hard under nor - mal circumstances. What was it like during the pandemic? The pandemic certainly magnified the challenges of getting equipment and hiring staff, especially having to do so many of those things over Zoom. But over time, I found a core group of col - leagues, and we supported each other through it all. Why did you come to Einstein? A key reason was the breadth of the science. I was excited to work with researchers in stem-cell biology, cancer dormancy, and chromatin biology, and with clinicians in lung cancer. I knew they would improve my science and help take it in new directions. What is the focus of your National Cancer Institute grant? In previous studies, I discovered that some late-stage lung cancer cells have excess levels of the transcription factor RUNX2. Transcription factors are pro - teins that turn specific genes on or off. Now we're investigating how RUNX2 activation affects disease progression. I hope this work will reveal new drug targets for slowing the development and spread of the disease. Cancer research generates vast quantities of data that must involve computational biology to be comprehensible. Is research becoming too far removed from hands-on experience? My lab uses single-cell sequencing, which produces large amounts of data about the epigenomic factors that drive lung cancer. Bioinformatics help us an - alyze those data and generate hypoth - eses. We also use mouse models, lung organoids, and cells and tissues from patients to validate those bioinformat - ics findings and refine our hypotheses. So it's a fruitful back-and-forth. What are organoids? They're tiny three-dimensional tissue cultures derived from mouse or human stem cells that mimic many of the properties of an organ. There's a limit to what aspects of human biology we can replicate in a petri dish, but as or - ganoid models become more complex, we'll increasingly use them in place of mouse models.You're in the Leading Edge Symposium. What is that about? It's a cross-institutional effort to sup - port women and nonbinary postdocs, with the goal of improving gender equity in the life sciences. What are the biggest barriers to gender equity in academia? Some barriers disproportionately affect women, such as inadequate access to childcare. Women are also underrep - resented in faculty positions, so it can be hard to find them as mentors and to feel a sense of belonging. These are just a few of the aspects of the institutional culture of academia that require change. What do you do for fun? My husband and I like to travel, go hiking, and explore new restaurants. Some days I just like to hang out a t home with my husband and my cat and watch movies or read. 14 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023 Photo by Jason Torres RESEARCH NOTESMAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 15Studying Heart Failure in Hispanics Researchers at Einstein and Montefiore have received a five-year, $5.2 million NIH grant to explore the underlying causes of heart failure among Hispanics/ Latinos, who are at heightened risk for heart disease. Investigators will simulta - neously evaluate heart function and the relationship between the heart and the aorta, the artery conveying oxygen-rich blood from the heart's left ventricle to the rest of the body. Researchers will recruit 1,600 Hispanic/Latino men and women over age 45 for the study. Participants will receive echocardiograms and other tests to determine the stiffness and functioning of the aorta, possible aorta-left ventricle coupling abnormal - ities, and the possible presence of heart failure and pre-heart failure.

Rodriguez, M.D., M.P .H., the principal investigator on the grant, is a professor of medicine and of epidemiology & population heath at Einstein and the director of clinical cardiology research and of cardiovascular epidemiology at Einstein and Montefiore.Leading a New York Research and Training Consortium The NIH has awarded Einstein a five- year, $6.6 million grant to lead a New York-based consortium of medical schools to train up to 10 young scien - tists annually in kidney, urology, and hematology research. The grant estab - lishes the New York Consortium for Interdisciplinary T raining in Kidney, Urological, and Hematological Research, bringing together more than 100 research and education experts from Einstein, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. The consortium will recruit up to 10 trainees each year, who will focus on diseases such as sickle-cell and kidney disease that disproportion - ately affect Black and Hispanic people and other marginalized groups. The grant's principal investigator is Michal Melamed, M.D., M.S., professor of medicine, of pediatrics, and of epidemi - ology & population health at Einstein and a nephrologist at Montefiore.Evaluating an Alzheimer's Screening Tool Investigators at Einstein, Montefiore, the Regenstrief Institute, and the Indiana University School of Medicine have received an $11 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to evaluate an Einstein-developed test for assessing cognitive impairment and dementia. The five-minute screening tool was designed for people from a range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, education levels, and socioeconomic circumstances, with the goals of reducing disparities in predementia and dementia diagnosis and treatment and of improving dementia care overall. The study will enroll 6,600 participants presenting with cognitive concerns in 22 primary-care clinics in the Bronx and Indiana.

Risk-Benefit Analysis of Playing Soccer More than 25 million Americans play soccer, which is the world's most popular sport. Soccer benefits brain health by boosting blood flow to that organ, but recent studies show that highly repetitive heading of the ball is associ - ated with structural brain changes and worse cognitive performance, similar to changes caused by concussion. The NIH has awarded Einstein researchers a five-year, $3.4 million grant to assess the trade-offs between soccer's aerobic brain benefits and the adverse effects from heading. The study will involve neuroimaging, exercise testing, and cognitive testing of 280 young men and women, half of them soccer players.

The Link Between HIV Infection and Depression Depression is the most common neuro - psychiatric illness among people living with HIV (PLWH). Three Einstein researchers have received a five-year, $3.85 million NIH grant to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that may connect the two comorbidities. The researchers will test their hypothesis that systemic inflammation disrupts the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and allows peripheral blood mononuclear cells to cross the BBB, altering the brain's reward circuity and contributing to depression in PLWH. The project may lead to strat - egies for improving both mental health and overall health in PLWH.

RESEARCH NOTES: MAJOR NIH AWARDS 16 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023Unraveling the Role of a Mitochondrial Protein ATP molecules provide the energy required for most cellular processes. Almost all ATP is synthesized in mito - chondria by a protein complex known as the mitochondrial ATP synthase. This protein complex has also been thought to function in a different form as the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which is involved in necrotic cell death. Richard Kitsis, M.D., has received a four-year, $2.8 million NIH grant to conduct studies to better understand the functions of the mito - chondrial ATP synthase. Using mouse models with cardiomyocytes deficient in this protein complex, Dr. Kitsis' lab will study the complex's role in cellular energetics and test whether it also func - tions as the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Dr. Kitsis is a professor of medicine and of cell biology, the Dr. Gerald and Myra Dorros Chair in Car - diovascular Disease, and the director of the Wilf Family Cardiovascular Research Institute at Einstein, and a cardiologist at Montefiore. Developing New Drug Targets for HIV To improve treatment for HIV, there is a need for longer-acting antiretroviral drugs to which HIV will not become resistant. One approach is to target host-virus interactions. Ganjam V. Kalpana, Ph.D., has received a five-year, $3.1 million NIH grant to develop drugs that disrupt the interface between an HIV-1 enzyme and a host-cell protein. That host-cell protein mimics a segment of HIV-1 RNA that also interacts with the same HIV-1 enzyme to enable viral replication, so drugs that disrupt HIV-1 enzyme/host-cell protein interactions are also likely to inhibit viral replication. Dr. Kalpana and colleagues plan to develop dual-acting drugs that interfere with both virus/host-cell protein interactions and viral protein/viral RNA interactions. Ideally, such drugs would inhibit HIV-1 replication without inducing drug resistance. Dr. Kalpana is a professor of genetics and of microbiology & immu - nology and is the Mark T rauner Faculty Scholar in Neuro-oncology at Einstein. Getting to the Heart of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome One in 4,000 live births is affect - ed by 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Approximately 60% of patients with the syndrome have congenital heart disease, most commonly cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defects, varying in severity from mild to severe. Approximately half of infants born with OFT defects require surgery to survive. Bernice Morrow, Ph.D., has received a four-year, $3.1 million grant from the NIH to better understand the developmental and genetic explanations for the wide vari - ability in OFT defect severity. She and colleagues will analyze whole-genome sequences from people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, some with OFT defects and others without them. DNA variants identified in this way will then be validated in zebrafish using gene editing. Dr. Morrow is a professor of genetics, of obstetrics & gynecology and women's health, and of pediatrics, the Sidney L. and Miriam K. Olson Chair in Cardiology, and the director of transla - tional genetics at Einstein. MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 17 Was there an \"aha!\" moment during your training that influ - enced your career path? During my residency, on my first night covering the pediatric intensive care unit, one of my patients was a coma - tose baby. The metabolic genetics team determined that she had a rare inborn error of metabolism called \"maple syrup urine disease, \" a potentially deadly condition. They did some magic with IV fluids and medications, and the next day she was sitting up in bed playing. I knew then and there that I would specialize in pediatric genetics. Today, that baby is an amazing young woman in her 20s, and she's still my patient. Did you have any mentors? Two pediatricians at Mount Sinai. One was Selma Snyderman [1916-2012], one of only two women in her medical school class at the University of Penn - sylvania. But rather than being intim - idated, she was absolutely fearless and went on to develop lifesaving treatments for children with inborn errors of metabolism. It was a very different time for women to be practicing medicine; when she had children, she was given just two weeks off for each pregnancy. Nonetheless, she and others showed a generation of women that they could be great physicians and have phenomenal family lives. The other mentor was Kurt Hirschhorn [1926-2022], a brilliant scientist, clinician, and role model. He was a pioneer in the field of cytogenetics and identified the genetic defect under - lying Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. He loved the field of genetics as much as he loved learning and teaching, and this combination was incredibly motivating. 18 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023 Melissa Wasserstein, M.D., is a professor of pediatrics and of genetics and the associate director of the Rose F . Kennedy Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Center at Einstein, and the chief of the division of pediatric genetic medicine at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore. A native of Long Island, Dr. Wasserstein earned a medical degree at the New York University School of Medicine, and then completed a residency in pediatrics and a fellowship in medical genetics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

As an attending physician, I start - ed working with patients who had Niemann-Pick disease, a rare genetic lipid-storage disorder that can cause a range of serious, progressive health problems. More than 25 years ago, I became involved in clinical studies to characterize the disease and, ultimate - ly, in clinical trials of a novel enzyme replacement therapy. The therapy, Xe - npozyme, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in August 2022. It was a long, long journey but well worth the effort. We finally have a treatment. I'm excited to see what the next 20 years will bring as we move from enzyme replacement therapy to, perhaps, curative gene therapies. It's such a fascinating field. Y ou have to keep learning because things change by the minute. Now that there's a treatment, will Niemann-Pick be added to routine newborn screening? Possibly. I'm leading a study called ScreenPlus, funded by the National Institutes of Health [NIH], in which we're studying how well newborn screening works for 14 rare genetic disorders, including Niemann-Pick. For treatable rare genetic disorders, it's important to know as early as pos - sible. Fortunately, new screening tech - nologies have greatly expanded the number and types of disorders that we can detect in babies. But before we screen for these disorders, it's im - portant to determine the accuracy of the tests and see how early detection affects the outcomes of infants who have the disorders. Another Screen -Plus focus is studying the ethical and social implications of screening tests. Can you provide some examples of the ethical and social implica - tions of newborn screening? There are a lot, especially now that we can screen babies for more and more conditions. For example, should we screen newborns for conditions that might not appear until later in life\u2014 even adulthood? Should we screen a newborn for untreatable diseases when knowing about them might allow par - ents to plan for the child's future and to make their own reproductive choic - es? As we move toward sequencing a baby's entire genome at birth\u2014which is a distinct possibility\u2014the practical and ethical implications of screening will become infinitely more complicat - ed. We need to address these sorts of questions as early as we can. Your other NIH grant addresses inequities in genomic medicine. What is the aim of this study? The idea behind NYCKidSeq\u2014a joint effort of Montefiore-Einstein, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the New Y ork Genome Center\u2014is to increase access to genomic medicine among children from racial and ethnic minority groups in New Y ork City. These kids bear a disproportionate bur - den of illness but lag in benefiting from advances in research and technology. We performed diagnostic whole- genome sequencing on 1,200 children from diverse backgrounds, with a focus on kids with unexplained seizures, developmental delays, heart disease, or immune abnormalities. We also tested new technologies to enhance educa -tion and counseling for families about genomic medicine. You were featured in a documen - tary with New York Giants run - ning back Saquon Barkley. What was the documentary about? The National Football League (NFL) was profiling Mr. Barkley's efforts to raise awareness about children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which affects his young niece. This syndrome causes intellectual disability, congen - ital heart disease, and other issues. My involvement came about through the work of Bernice Morrow [Ph.D.], an Einstein professor who studies the genetics of the syndrome and was a driving force behind the creation of the Montefiore-Einstein Regional Center for 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, where I'm part of the treatment team.

MELISSA WASSERSTEIN MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 1920 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023 Einstein scientists and their trainees find that collaboration benefits both sides of the equation BY TERESA CARR MattersMENTO SHIP MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 21\"Being a mentor is all about opening doors for students\u2014giving your mentees a glimpse of what's possible,\" Ms. Feliz Norberto says. \"It also means provid - ing support, so the mentee knows that someone is in their corner to help. That's crucial.\" Mentorship is essential for devel - oping the next generation of scientific researchers. Mentees learn professional - ism, get hands-on training, are exposed to different specialties, and become more effective in the research arena. The relationship benefits the mentors too: Studies show that mentors experience increased scientific productivity and enjoy more career success than scientists who don't mentor. Here, we highlight five groups of Einstein mentors and their mentees and explain how the relationships have improved their scientific investigations. PH.D. PARTNERSHIP: TERESA BOWMAN, SOFIA DE OLIVEIRA, AND MARIA ALEJANDRA FELIZ NORBERTO When it came time to choose a mentor for her graduate research, Ms. Feliz Norberto (pictured across at top left) couldn't decide. After arriving at Einstein, she had enjoyed her post - baccalaureate research experience in the lab of Teresa Bowman, Ph.D., associate professor of developmental and molecu - lar biology, of oncology, and of medicine at Einstein and a member of the Ruth L. and David S. Gottesman Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center. And during her rotation period while she was in the first year of grad school, she'd had a great research expe - rience in the lab of Sofia de Oliveira, Ph.D., assistant professor of develop - mental and molecular biology and of medicine at Einstein and chair of the Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center women's initiative network. \"I wanted both on my team,\" she says. She ended up asking if she could have each of them as mentors, and the two scientists agreed. \"We wanted to work with her,\" says Dr. Bowman. \"So we created a research project for Maria Alejandra that would capture both of our areas of interest.\" It helped that both mentors use zebrafish as model organisms to study blood cells. Dr. de Oliveira studies neutrophils, the white blood cells that fight infections, heal injuries, and combat cancer by infiltrating the tumor microenvironment. And Dr. Bowman focuses on mutations in hematopoietic (blood-forming) stem cells (HSCs) that lead to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the blood disorders in which bone marrow produces defective blood cells that crowd out normal adult blood cells. About one-third of MDS cases Maria Alejandra Feliz Norberto is a big believer in mentors. In fact, the third-year Einstein graduate student has two of them. Moreover, she herself has become a mentor, working with four high school students and with two students from her alma mater, Lehman College. MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 21Photos by Jason Torres22 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023evolve into acute myeloid leukemia, an often-deadly blood cancer. It turns out that some MDS patients also have too few neutrophils, leaving them susceptible to infection. \"That allowed for a good collaboration involving both mentors,\" says Ms. Feliz Norberto. For her project, the three of them decided, Ms. Feliz Norberto would investigate interactions between HSCs and neutrophils that eventually lead to MDS. The arrangement has benefited Ms. Feliz Norberto as well as her mentors. \"I am learning a lot about neutrophils and thinking about the feedback they provide to the blood system and how that feedback winds up regulating HSCs,\" Dr. Bowman reports. Dr. de Oliveira says she is \"learning how HSCs\u2014the progenitors of the blood system\u2014affect what we see later in neutrophils.\" Ms. Feliz Norberto dreams of having her own lab someday. \"As a member of an underrepresented minority, I sometimes have trouble seeing myself in these big positions,\" she says. \"But having two mentors who are successful female scientists tells me that I can make this happen and that I can help other students see themselves in this position one day.\" POSTDOC COLLABORATION: NICHOLAS SIBINGA AND GUSTAVO OLIVEIRA DE PAULA In 2018, Gustavo Oliveira de Paula, Ph.D., traveled from his native Brazil to accept a postdoctoral position in the \"Having two mentors who are successful female scientists tells me that I can help other students see themselves in this position one day.\" \u2014 PH.D. STUDENT MARIA ALEJANDRA FELIZ NORBERTO Ph.D. student Maria Alejandra Feliz Norberto, right, discusses zebrafish with mentors Sofia de Oliveira, Ph.D., left, and Teresa Bowman, Ph.D. MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 23 lab of Nicholas Sibinga, M.D., professor of medicine and of developmental and molecular biology at Einstein. The two agreed to give the arrangement a year. Now, nearly five years later, Dr. Oliveira de Paula is still here. The good fit was not immediate - ly apparent. Dr. Sibinga studies the biological mechanisms of cardiovas - cular disease. For his Ph.D. research, Dr. Oliveira de Paula had focused on pharmacology. But to develop effective drugs, he realized, he could benefit from a mentor with expertise regard - ing the biological processes that lead to disease. Dr. Sibinga viewed the relationship as a win-win. \"Gustavo could learn some new science,\" he realized, \"and the lab would benefit from his pharma - cology expertise. People typically think that the flow of information goes from senior to junior colleagues, but it often goes the other way around.\" Indeed, the two are combining their knowledge domains to reach the same goal. \"We're dedicated to understanding the cellular processes in heart disease better, with an eye to identifying mole - cules to target with drug therapies,\" says Dr. Sibinga, who is also a cardiologist at Montefiore. Dr. Oliveira de Paula uses mouse models to study the cellular changes affecting blood vessels as they become clogged with plaque. He's also ex - ploring how angioplasty and stent - ing\u2014cardiac procedures for opening blocked arteries\u2014affect cellular processes. For example, he notes that one-fourth of patients who undergo angioplasty plus stenting end up with scar tissue around the stent, which narrows the artery again. \"Ultimately, we'd like to find new ways to treat vascular obstruction, possibly without invasive procedures,\" he says. Good mentor-mentee relationships can last a lifetime. Dr. Oliveira de Paula intends to apply for grants in both the United States and Brazil to fund his own independent research. \"But I feel like wherever I go,\" he says, \"I'm going to maintain this collabora - tion with Nick.\" \"People think that the flow of information goes from senior to junior colleagues, but it often goes the other way around.\" \u2014 DR.

The recognition is all due to her encouragement and belief in my potential.\" \u2014 M.D./PH.D. STUDENT HAYDEN HATCHM.D./PH.D. MENTORSHIP: JULIE SECOMBE AND HAYDEN HATCH Early in his M.D./Ph.D. training, eighth-year Einstein student Hayden Hatch realized he wanted to work in the lab of Julie Secombe, Ph.D. She was studying KDM5 proteins that regulate the expression of genes involved in intel - lectual disability and certain cancers. The hitch was that Mr. Hatch, a neuroscience student, needed a neuroscience faculty member as a mentor\u2014but Dr. Secombe was at the time an associate professor of genetics. \"I was over the moon at the prospect of having someone with a neurosci - ence background come to my lab,\" Dr. Secombe says. \"So I decided to apply to join the neuroscience department, even though I had to meet with every single tenured faculty member over there,\" she says with a laugh. The secondary appointment in neuroscience, she says, \"turned out to be a great thing for me personally.\" She is now a professor of genetics and in the Dominick P . Purpura Department of Neuroscience. Mr. Hatch had never taken a genetics class but had spent two years as a research technician at New York University Medical Center, studying the fruit-fly brain to better understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying complex behaviors. And Dr. Secombe, who also worked with fruit flies, needed someone to investigate how KDM5 proteins regulate neurodevelopment MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 25 within the fruit-fly brain. \"That would help us better understand how mu - tations in these genes contribute to human disease,\" she says. The two clicked right from the start. \"Did we talk about cats at our first meeting?\" asks Dr. Secombe. \"Probably,\" answers Mr. Hatch. \"We bonded over our love of cats.\" For his thesis research, Mr. Hatch conducted experiments that showed that KDM5 proteins help regulate the devel - opment and function of neurons. \"We saw similar behavioral deficits, such as impairments in learning and memory, in fruit flies that had the same genetic variants as those that cause intellectual disability in humans,\" he notes. His research led to multiple pub - lications and has garnered numerous accolades, including Einstein's Julius Marmur Award, Einstein's Junior Investigator Neuroscience Research Award, and the Genetics Society of America's DeLill Nasser Award for Professional Development in Genetics. \"Julie encourages me to put myself out there,\" says Mr. Hatch. \"The recogni - tion is all due to her encouragement and belief in my potential.\" Both say that a meaningful aspect of their collaboration was connecting with families of people with intellectual dis - abilities linked to mutations in KDM5 genes. Eleven of these families trav - eled from around the world to attend Einstein's Rare Disease Day in 2020, which focused on KDM5. In 2021, in the American Journal of Medical Genetics , the two researchers published results of a survey of caregivers of 37 children with the rare disorder\u2014the largest study group reported to date. Because of his interest in intel - lectual disability, autism, and other neurodevelopmental disorders, Mr. Hatch plans to apply for a residency in pediatric neurology this year. He would like to treat patients and to become a principal investigator in his own lab, where he can also mentor students. \"Mentoring gives you an amazing opportunity to instill a great scientific mindset in the next generation,\" Dr. Secombe says. \"You get to see students go out in the world and succeed, know - ing you've helped them develop what they take with them.\" MEDICAL STUDENT GUIDANCE: ROY CHUCK AND JESSINTA OSENI It's the nature of science that \"many great ideas either totally bomb or at least don't turn out as expected,\" says Roy Chuck, M.D., Ph.D. He was lamenting that, all too often, medical students who add a full year of research to their training have little to show for their efforts\u2014which could have been the case for one of his mentees, fourth-year student Jessinta Oseni. But after several of her initial research projects with Dr. Chuck were delayed or failed to work out, the pair decided to address an important clinical question: Can corneas from young donors who've died from head trauma be safely donated for transplant? Working with Saving Sight, one of the nation's largest eye banks, Ms. Oseni examined 287 corneas that had been removed from people young - er than 50 who had died from head injuries. Studying data on and images of those corneas, she focused on the endothelial layer\u2014the cell layer that lines the bottom of the cornea and that's responsible for keeping the cornea \"I learned that it's important to know when to ask for assistance and that it takes a team to successfully complete a project.\" \u2014 MEDICAL STUDENT JESSINTA OSENI26 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023 compact and clear, allowing for sharp vision in organ recipients. The transplant community had long assumed that head trauma\u2014from a gunshot wound or car accident, for example\u2014would so significantly dam - age the corneal endothelium that those corneas would be unusable for trans - plant surgery.

She presented the results of her study at two major con - ferences, and they were published in the Fourth-year medical student Jessinta Oseni goes over her corneal-donor research project with her mentor, Roy Chuck, M.D., Ph.D. journal Cornea in November 2022 . Dr. Chuck, who is a professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences, the Paul Henkind Chair in Ophthalmology, and a professor of genetics at Einstein and the chair of ophthalmology at Montefiore, hails the importance of Ms. Oseni's findings. \"If we can continue to figure out which factors make a cornea transplantable or not transplantable using evidence-based methods, we're going to affect the world as we expand our scarce donor-organ pools,\" he says. Ms. Oseni says she is grateful that Dr. Chuck gave her the freedom to run her study but was always there for guid - ance. \"As a student researcher, you want to figure everything out yourself,\" Ms. Oseni says. \"I learned that it's import - ant to know when to ask for assistance and that it takes a team to successfully complete a project.\" Dr. Chuck notes that becoming a good mentor can take time. \"There are some faculty members who are natu - rals as mentors, and for others there's a learning curve,\" he says. \"I don't know that I was great at mentoring when I first began taking on students 25 years ago, but I think I'm getting better at it.\" MENTORS AND MENTEES MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 27 \"The process of helping young people see the world is a privilege.\" \u2014 DR. HASAN BAZARIHasan Bazari, M.D. '83, and his Melissa Iammatteo, M.D. '12, FAAAAI, faced a dilemma: Should she stay in academic medicine or accept a job offer from a pharma - ceutical company to oversee the first-in-humans trial of a vaccine for peanut allergies? Taking the job would cut her off from what she loved about medicine\u2014the personal interactions with patients. But she was excited by the possi - bility of affecting people's lives on a global scale. To help her decide, she called on the wisdom of one of her mentors, Hasan Bazari, M.D. '83, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston. The two Einstein alumni had first met during Dr. Iammatteo's residency at Harvard Medical School and MGH. She'd been considering a switch from emergency medicine to internal medicine and was nervous about meeting Dr. Bazari, who was the di - rector of MGH's internal medicine program at that time. \"But he was so warm and welcoming,\" she says, \"and we had an instant connection through Einstein.\" Dr. Bazari became her rock\u2014easing her transition to internal medicine, connecting her with other mentors when she went on to specialize in allergy and immunology, and even helping her husband, a lawyer, find a job in Boston.Dr. Bazari says that more than 1,000 trainees passed through the MGH internal medicine program while he was in charge. But Dr. Iammatteo stood out, he says: \"You didn't have to tell her what to do\u2014just ask the right questions.\" When it came to discussing her job dilemma, Dr. Iammatteo appreciated how Dr. Bazari helped guide her to the decision she realized was in her heart all along. \"He's like [the Star Wars character] Yoda,\" she says. \"He's so brilliant and yet so humble.\" With his support, she says, she felt confident about taking her career in a new direction and accepted the position as a clinical development physician at Allergy Therapeutics. Today, Dr. Bazari teaches, volunteers for the Einstein Alumni Association's board of governors, and maintains relationships with scores of mentees. \"The process of helping young people see the world is a privilege,\" he says. \"You get to watch someone's true purpose unfold before your eyes.

Some of these efforts are described in the following pages. JUST SAY YES Montefiore's child psychologists have developed a variety of arts and activity programs to help local children and teens cope with mental health issues This lyric was written not by a seasoned songwriter but by a 9-year-old Bronx boy. Carlos (not his real name) experienced abuse as a young child and was bullied later in school\u2014traumas that have deeply affect - ed him. He was at Montefiore's Moses Child Outpatient Psychiatry Division (COPD) for counseling when his ther - apist, Jenny Seham, Ph.D., introduced him to Hear Your Song, a nonprofit organization that empowers children through songwriting.\"I said to Carlos, 'My friends are musicians. Would you like to write a song with them?' And just like that, he started singing,\" says Dr. Seham. Carlos later returned to the COPD to join the songwriting program. It's one of the COPD's more than half dozen Youth Empowerment Series (YES) programs aimed at helping children and adolescents come to terms with mental health issues, from post-traumatic stress disorder to depression to anxiety. \"The idea is to create a safe, thera - peutic environment where kids, working individually and in groups, can actively explore whatever is troubling them, under the guidance of mental health professionals and local experts in the arts and other fields,\" says Dr. Seham, found - er and director of Montefiore Einstein's Arts and Integrative Medicine (AIM) program, which oversees YES. Launched in 2018, AIM offers 12- to 15-week sessions in songwriting, dance, yoga, photography, painting, poetry, and gardening, which are open to children Why you have to be like this?

The goal is to bring joy, inspire creativity, and provide health bene - fits. \"Our programming is founded on evidence-based practices that have been shown to affect both mental and physical health,\" says Dr. Seham. She was referring to a 2019 World Health Organization report, What Is the Evidence \"When there's a block in therapy, the arts can often provide a way through.

His father passed away when Ciro was 11, sending him into a deep depres - sion. A month later, he was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, an aggressive type of blood cancer. The next three years were one long blur\u2014an endless stretch of hospital - izations at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore (CHAM) and elsewhere, with treatments that caused bouts of confusion, epileptic seizures, and crip - pling muscle weakness. Bedbound for months on end, he grew increasingly anxious and fearful about socializing. Five years into his ordeal, Ciro's psychotherapist, Jenny Seham, Ph.D., recommended group therapy pro - grams at Montefiore's Moses Child Outpatient Psychiatry Division, where he could mingle with other kids with the same concerns. Trembling with anxiety, he attended a few sessions, dropped out for a while, and even - tually returned. \"What calmed me down was finding other teenagers with the same interests in music, video games, and anime,\" he says. Still, depression and anxiety would get the best of him. When she learned that Ciro was interested in drawing, Dr. Seham urged him to join the Youth on the Role of the Arts in Improving Health and Well-Being? , which reviewed findings from more than 900 relevant publications from around the globe. \"When there's a block in therapy, the arts can often provide a way through,\" adds Dr. Seham, an artist, choreog - rapher, dancer, and actor as well as a psychologist and an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Einstein. \"It's an expansion of the ways we can reach our patients, in addition to traditional means.\" Through her own studies, Dr. Seham is adding to the evidence in support of arts programming for youth with mental health issues. She also examines the impact of programs on the broader community, in and out of the hospital. In two recent studies, she found that the YES Gallery and the YES Community Garden positively influenced the mood of Montefiore employees (no small benefit for workers in such a high-stress environment) and could help reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. As for Carlos, the YES songwriting program certainly appears to be work - ing. \"He ended up writing a whole song about 'going through the dark and com - ing into the light,'\" says Dr. Seham. \"He tells me he sings it all the time at home.\" Teens gather with guitars and a laptop computer for a songwriting session at Montefiore Einstein's Arts and Integrative Medicine program.\"Our programming is founded on evidence-based practices that have been shown to affect both mental and physical health.\" \u2014 DR.

There, psychotherapists and professional artists use the arts to create a healing environment for children and adoles - cents with mental health issues. Ciro started drawing again and impressed everyone with his talent. His social skills flourished along with his artistic skill. \"It distracted my mind from all my other problems and gave me practice socializing and communicating,\" he says. In 2022, Dr. Seham invited Ciro to exhibit his works in the YES Art Gallery at Montefiore, but the invitation awakened painful child - hood memories: classmates had ridiculed his artwork back in elemen - tary school. \"I would hide my draw - ings from my teachers, from other students,\" he recalls. But with his newfound confidence, Ciro agreed to exhibit his work. \"I'm still working on my issues,\" admits Ciro, now 21. \"I can't say I'm happy or sad, more like in between, neither in the light nor in the dark.\" But there's a much brighter side to his remarkable story.

The condition is poorly understood biologically and has a range of possible causes, including genetics, stress - ful life events, and medical conditions. \"My lab is focused on identifying the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie adolescent depression and that may predict outcomes,\" says Dr. Gabbay, who is also the director of the Psychiatry Research Institute at Montefiore Einstein (PRIME) Center for Biomarkers and Dimensional Psychiatry. She has a good idea where to start looking. In previous research, Dr. Gabbay found that, of all the core symptoms of adolescent depression, only anhedonia\u2014 the inability to feel pleasure\u2014was associ - ated with worse outcomes, including an increased risk of suicide. The discovery suggests that impaired brain-reward cir - cuitry\u2014which controls the ability to feel pleasure\u2014might cause severe cases of teen depression to continue. Using brain imaging to look deep - er, Dr. Gabbay found that depressed adolescents have abnormally low levels of GABA (the brain's major inhibitory neurotransmitter), plus abnormal acti - vation patterns in brain regions related to anticipating and attaining reward (the \"planning\" and \"receiving\" components of reward processing). Dr. Gabbay also found that immune system irregularities, including elevated levels of interferon GETTING TO THE SOURCE OF ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION Irregularities in the brain's reward circuit may play a key role That old medical-school joke\u2014 \"Half of everything we teach you is wrong, but we don't know which half\"\u2014has the ring of truth when it comes to teens stricken by major depres - sive episodes: doctors know that half of them will fully recover, while the other half will develop severe depression or a chronic mood disorder\u2014but doctors can't predict who will recover and who won't. \"In psychiatry, we diagnose depres - sion from symptoms, but that can be subjective, and it doesn't give us much insight into a patient's prognosis,\" says Vilma Gabbay, M.D., professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and in the Dominick P .

Clinicians were in uncharted territory, uncertain how best to respond to this novel threat to pediatric mental health. \"But we knew from decades of research that child resilience is tied to caregiver resilience,\" says Sandra Pimentel, Ph.D., chief of child and adolescent psycholo - gy at Montefiore and Einstein and an associate profes - sor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Einstein. So Montefiore's experts in psychiatry and behavioral sciences and in pediatrics began extending lifelines to parents, both on the staff and in the community. Through a community speakers bureau she created, Dr. Pimentel and colleagues gave dozens of talks in neighbor - hoods throughout the Bronx and met with organizations such as parent-teacher and faith-based groups. They developed parent support groups, created a confidential emotional support line for caregivers, produced tip sheets on such topics as \"Helping Kids Cope with Grief and Loss,\" and led grand rounds such as \"Supporting Family and Child Emotional Health During COVID-19.\" Help was also offered to teens and young adults directly affected by the pandemic. Dr. Pimentel and her colleagues in the Becoming an Emerging Adult at Montefiore (BEAM) program collaborated with local Bronx youth to conduct virtual town halls discussing loneliness and isolation. Meanwhile, Vilma Gabbay, M.D. (see opposite page), was awarded a $4.1 million National Institutes of Health grant to study interventions to reduce pandemic-related symptoms of depression and anxiety among Bronx care - givers. The randomized trial will evaluate three approach - es. One-third of the 360 participants will receive 12 weeks of group telehealth therapy, expanding on the work of Connecting and Reflecting Experience (CARE), a group- based program at Montefiore and Einstein developed by Amanda Zayde, Psy.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Einstein and psychologist at Montefiore. Another third of the participants will receive 12 weeks of parenting education supported by the Valera Health smartphone app, with a focus on teaching caregiv - ers problem-solving, communication, and coping skills. The final third will receive both interventions. \"As a psychiatrist and a mom, I want caregivers in the Bronx to have the tools to be confident in tough parenting situations and tackle stress and uncertainty in a healthy way,\" says Dr. Gabbay. MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 35 Mindfulness Helping your child focus on what's around them, what they see and hear, can help pull your child away from the anxiety and ground them in the present moment. Doing activities together (playing a game) that can bring their attention into the present moment is another way to practice. Coping Statements Teach your child to talk back to their worries- \"Even though I'm scared, I can handle it.\" \"I'm stronger than my worries.\" Coping Ahead Teach your child that when you have to do some - thing that makes you nervous, it helps to plan in advance how to help yourself in the moment. If you can push through it, it will get easier! Acceptance Help your child acknowledge discomfort with - out fighting it. Ignoring, judging, or avoiding the anxiety will likely make it grow bigger and more powerful. Teach them that everyone feels anxious at times, and that it is OK to feel anxious. You can feel anxious and do things that are important to you anyway.

Bibliotherapy has now entered the digital realm and found its way into social media platforms designed to support people at risk for suicide and other personal crises. One proponent of digital bibliother - apy is Peter Franz, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research fellow at PRIME, who studies ways to prevent self-injurious thoughts and behaviors. \"Loneliness is a major risk factor for suicide,\" says Dr. Franz. \"The question is, how can we create connec - tions between people that are reparative and therapeutic?\" The standard approaches to suicide prevention\u2014traditional psychotherapy and medical treatment\u2014could cer - tainly be improved upon. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide rates have barely budged over the last century, and suicide now ranks as the second-leading cause of death among individuals ages 15 to 44. \"There's a great need for new ap - proaches, particularly ones that are low cost, engaging, accessible, and scalable,\" says Dr. Franz. Digital bibliotherapy appears to fit the bill. \"We all know that people can engage in potentially harmful communication online,\" Dr. Franz acknowledges. \"But there are also places online that offer a supportive environment where people are comfortable being themselves and where there's less stigma associated with talking about mental health concerns such as suicide. We know that young people at risk for suicide are engaging in online discussions at a higher rate than their age- matched peers, and linking them up with a supportive online community might be incredibly helpful.\" Could such an online resource work as intended? To find out, Dr. Franz tested the impact of digital bibliotherapy on 528 adults\u2014each with a history of suicidal thoughts\u2014who were randomly divided into two groups. One group read short stories on a social media platform that describe firsthand experiences with suicidal thoughts and recovery from having those thoughts. People in the second group were placed on a waiting list for the platform. After two weeks, participants who read the stories and other inflammatory proteins, were associated with anhedonia severity and abnormal reward circuitry in adolescents. Now, in a new study supported by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health, Dr. Gabbay is taking a more comprehensive look at how reward dysfunction and immunological abnor - malities might contribute to adolescent depression. She plans to enroll a diverse group of 120 adolescents with depressive symptoms and follow them over two years. The teens will receive comprehensive clinical evaluations, and those diagnosed with clinical depression will take comput - erized tests designed to engage and measure their reward circuitry. The researchers will look for known biomarkers of inflam - mation and measure participants' GABA levels. In addition, the teens will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging during the reward testing to evaluate their ability to feel pleasure, depression severity, functioning, anxiety, and risk of suicide. \"We hope our study will identify objective diagnostic criteria for adoles - cent depression and will lead to targeted therapies that address the underlying causes of the condition and not just the symptoms,\" says Dr. Gabbay.

And it can be given anytime, with no waiting to talk to a therapist or get a prescription.\" He is now planning to test the digital bib - liotherapy intervention on adolescents. Dr. Franz has done research with TeenHelp.com and TheMighty.com\u2014 websites that provide online support for people experiencing mental health challenges\u2014and is also exploring other ways to use digital technology to support young people at risk. \"Suicidal thoughts tend to ebb and flow quite a bit, even during the course of a single day,\" he explains. \"If you ask patients in your office if they're thinking about hurting themselves, they may say 'No'\u2014but that could change five minutes after they walk out the door. We need a way to assess suicidal thoughts and engage with people more regularly.\" One solution, Dr. Franz believes, is to use a smartphone app to check in on people several times a day. \"In theory, we could more accurately assess their suicide risk and provide interventions in a time - lier manner,\" he says. \"We could also use the app to better understand what life events tend to trigger suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Then we could intervene before those thoughts and behaviors ever materialize. I'd say that a very large proportion of individuals who are thinking about suicide are not receiving treatment,\" continues Dr. Franz. \"That's a challenge we need to overcome.\"Photo by J\u00f6rg Meyer 38 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023The endless replays of acts of violence against people of color\u2014a staple of cable news coverage\u2014can also be traumatiz - ing, experts say. And making matters worse, few mental health professionals are prepared to help young people who experience RRS. While he was a full-time faculty member at Einstein, Dr. DeLapp and his colleague Laurie Gallo, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Einstein and a psychologist at Montefiore, worked to fill this underappreciated gap in clinical care. Together they developed REACH UP (Racial, Ethnic, and Cultural Healing Unifying Principles), a ther - apeutic framework designed to help clinicians identify and treat adolescents and young adults affected by RRS. REACH UP aims to empower patients by identifying challenges that hinder the ability to embrace their racial/ethnic identity, and developing both acute and long-term mechanisms for coping with the intense emotional discomfort associat - ed with racism. The intervention unfolds over six to eight therapy sessions. Drs. DeLapp and Gallo aren't the first to prescribe remedies for RRS. However, their approach is the first to target clinicians of varying train - ing levels, cultural backgrounds, and theoretical orientations. REACH UP is not a standalone therapy; it was devised to supplement other psychotherapeutic approaches. \"In most clinical settings, particularly hospital-based outpatient psychiatric clinics, patients present with other men - tal health issues. RRS is rarely, if ever, a primary reason why they are seeking help. Our approach was therefore craft - ed to be flexible enough to work within a patient's overall treatment plan,\" says Dr. DeLapp, whose treatment guide was published in November 2022 in the Journal of Health Service Psychology . In March 2023, Dr. DeLapp took on a new position: launching the REACH UP program at a group practice serv - ing youths and young adults across several states. He continues working as a part-time clinician at Einstein and Montefiore, focused on helping young people cope with stress related to racism. Photo by Jason Torres \"Racism has been around forever.

Some are naturally re - silient and able to weather those stresses, but others suffer significant psychologi - cal harm, especially those already coping with mental health issues. \"Racism has been around forever. Over the past few decades researchers have amassed enough evidence to un - equivocally show that it can be harmful, emotionally and physiologically\u2014exac - erbating everything from anxiety to de - pression to suicidal ideation,\" says Ryan DeLapp, Ph.D., who was until recently an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Einstein. The problem now has its own name: racism-related stress (RRS), defined as psychological distress stemming from direct or indirect experiences of racism, ranging from racial microaggressions (subtle, intentional, or unintentional degradations and exclusions that may be imperceptible to others) to overt acts of discrimination in everyday life (e.g., in school, at work, in social situations). A recent twist to RRS is the near- constant depiction of racism in the broader culture, such as cable news and social media after events such as the murder of George Floyd. \"The natural reaction is to want to learn more, to make sense of it all,\" says Dr. DeLapp. \"More information is better, right? But it can set off endless 'doomscrolling,' where information overwhelms your ability to absorb it.\" HEALING CHILD & TEEN MENTAL HEALTHMAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 39 MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 39 MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 3939 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2022ONE IN SIX U.S. youth ages 6 to 17 experiences a mental health disorder each yearSocioeconomically disadvantaged children and adolescents are TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY to develop mental health conditions than peers with higher socioeconomic status of youth in the juvenile justice system have diagnosable mental health conditions ONE IN FIVE young people reports that the pandemic had a significant negative impact on their mental health 70% SUICIDE IS SECOND TO ACCIDENTS as the leading cause of death among people ages 10 to 14 in the United States YOUNG BLACK ADOLESCENTS are twice as likely to die by suicide than their white peers LESBIAN, GAY, AND BISEXUAL YOUTH are nearly four times more likely to attempt suicide than straight youthMORE THAN ONE IN THREE high school students continually felt unhappy or hopeless in 2019, A 40% INCREASE SINCE 2009CHILD AND YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH: BY THE NUMBERS 50% of all lifetime mental illness begins by age 14 and 75% begins by age 24 Sources: American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; National Alliance on Mental Illness.The percentage of high-school girls reporting \"persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness\" rose from 36% to 57% from 2011 to 2021 , with the sharpest increase occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dr. Pimentel worked with colleagues in pediatrics to identify the greatest psychological challenges that hospitalized kids face (fear, pain, loneliness, and depression) and strategies for coping with those \"mon - sters\" in the superhero lexicon. \"Superheroes are born of adversity,\" says Dr. Pimentel. \"That's their origin story. But what makes them heroic is their resilience and their ability to overcome their personal monsters. In Superkids , we ask kids to identify their monsters and we introduce them to the special evidence-based skills, or 'power-ups,' that they can wield to defeat the monsters.\" Young readers of Superkids are intro - duced to mindful breathing and other power-ups, asked to identify their own heroes, encouraged to build their social support teams with sidekicks such as pets and friends, and, ideally, become inspired to help other kids in need. (Bronx readers may notice that the comic's cover shows the Superkids bursting from the entrance of CHAM on Bainbridge Avenue.) Judging from a small initial pilot study, Superkids is an easy-to-read, accessible format for teaching evidence-based skills for coping with pain and adversity. \"It was really helpful, and I felt more positive after reading the comic book,\" one young reader commented. The team is now conducting a ran - domized clinical trial testing how best to deliver Superkids in the hospital setting. It is also modifying Superkids to address the interests and needs of older kids. \"In Superkids \u2014and for that matter in all of our work\u2014we're trying to be creative in how we deliver care,\" says Dr. Pimentel. \"It doesn't have to be sitting a patient in a chair and saying, 'Let's do therapy.'\" WHAT IS YOUR SUPERPOWER? Hospitalized kids cast themselves as heroes in a therapeutic comic book Of the many projects she has helped lead, Sandra Pimentel, Ph.D., may be most proud of Superkids: Change the World , an interac - tive comic book that helps hospitalized children\u2014particularly those spend - ing long stretches away from school, friends, and family\u2014cope with the adversities of illness. The idea for Superkids came from Chase Masterson, an actor who founded the Pop Culture Hero Coalition, which uses superhero comic book imagery and narratives to help children develop social and emotional skills. She want - ed to honor Bronx comic book writer Len Wein, who'd been hospitalized as a kid\u2014and whose lifelong love of comics was sparked by the comic books his father brought to keep him occupied. A comic book supporting other children in that predicament seemed like the perfect tribute.

Physicians and students are melding technology and science to improve patient health BY SUE BYRNELAUNCHING MEDICINE'S next innovators Medical student Soaptarshi Paul says he \"couldn't be happier\" about getting the opportunity to put his computer-science background to use at Einstein. This past fall he and several of his classmates were able to pursue innovation biodesign training in an elective offered to fourth-year students that aims to en - courage the development of technologies such as mobile health apps. Mr. Paul and his peers, who were born in the mid to late 1990s, are members of the first genera - tion of \"digital natives.\" The internet, mobile phones, and social media have been a part of their experience from their youngest years, shaping their interactions with the world and inspiring an intuitive understanding of the oppor - tunities digital applications can play in healthcare. \"Today's medical students have access to technology that wasn't available even 10 years ago,\" Mr. Paul says. \"We want to be able to think about new ways to make the healthcare system more efficient and improve patient outcomes. In the biode - sign space you break out of the box and think more creatively.\" THERE'S AN APP FOR THAT Einstein's biodesign effort is led by Sunit Jariwala, M.D., professor of medicine and director of clinical and research innova - tion at Einstein, medical director of digital transformation at Montefiore, and co- director of the Montefiore Asthma Center. As an allergist and immunologist, Dr. Jariwala knew that people in the Bronx suffer from one of the country's highest rates of asthma. He also knew that fully half of all asthma patients don't follow their doctors' advice, putting themselves at risk for serious complications. So he and his team came up with a technolog - ical fix to help patients breathe easier: an interactive and personalized app that patients can use to access asthma educa - tion and medication reminders just by reaching for their mobile phones. Called ASTHMAXcel, the app was modeled on a health educator-delivered training for patients at the Montefiore Asthma Center. \"We needed to empower our patients when it came to their health,\" he explains. \"So we based the app on educational videos describing how to use asthma medications, how to recognize the warning signs of an asthma attack, and how to track symptoms. We also included push notifications to remind patients to take their medication.\" Following several years of testing, ASTHMAXcel was introduced in 2017 as Einstein and Montefiore's first home - grown mobile app. After using the app for two months, patients reported better control over their asthma attacks, used ste - roids less often, and had fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations. The results were published in November 2020 in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. The success of the two asthma mobile platforms spurred Dr. Jariwala to create the Einstein/Montefiore Innovation Biodesign T raining Program in 2020, one of only six such programs in the country and the first to focus on chronic conditions and health disparities. Since its inception, the one-year experience has trained 18 residents, fellows, and attend - ings working in a variety of areas, from neurosurgery and diabetes care to cardi - ology and anesthesiology. The program includes coursework, a clinical immer - sion experience, a scholarly project, and mentoring from Einstein and Montefiore faculty and external experts. MOBILE HEALTH TOOLS The training has led to the creation of mobile health tools for pediatric asthma patients as well as for other conditions, including COVID-19, type 2 diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis - ease. \"We wanted to take these technolo - gies on a larger scale across departments and across chronic conditions, and teach faculty, residents, fellows, and medical students how to identify and address pain points. Then we could build the proto - types, help validate them, and scale them up to get them in the hands of patients,\" Dr. Jariwala says. Supported by more than $2 million in NEXT INNOVATORS \"We want to be able to think about new ways to make the healthcare system more efficient and improve patient outcomes. In the biodesign space you break out of the box and think more creatively.\" \u2014 MEDICAL STUDENT SOAPTARSHI PAUL MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 43grant funding from foundations, indus - try, and the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), the Einstein/Montefiore Innovation Biodesign T raining Program has led to the creation of 12 apps as well as 10 peer-reviewed published manu - scripts, 25 seminars, and nearly a dozen health-technology podcasts. OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS In 2020 Einstein medical students were surveyed about their interest in course - work on health innovation. Based on the enthusiastic response, the Health Technology/Innovation elective was opened to fourth-years in the fall of 2021. The coursework not only covers medical devices and digital health technologies but also includes a market assessment to find out if there's a real need for a particular healthcare device in the first place. \"For example, if you want to find a way to develop a better diabetes medica - tion-compliance tool, you want first to learn about competitors already in the market and how you could be different and provide value,\" Mr. Paul says. \"If your device is a Bluetooth sensor that connects a fourth-year elective: During their first 18 months at Einstein, students can take biodesign and entrepreneurship classes within the new four-year Impact course, which will also expose them to basic- science research, community engagement, and global health. \"We wanted to build in these oppor - tunities early on,\" says Jessica Rieder, M.D., M.S., inaugural director of the new Impact course, associate professor of pediatrics at Einstein, and a pediatrician at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore. \"We want to allow students to explore the different career paths available to them, open their horizons, develop their profes - sional identity, and help them realize that they can be leaders in these areas.\" During the summer after their first year, students can participate in the Einstein-CUNY Design Challenge to work with a team of Einstein and CUNY students and a faculty mentor or a team of professionals to develop a project that might lead to the creation of their own healthcare apps. \"A lot of students already have been involved in these activities on their own time,\" Dr. Rieder says. \"The Impact course is designed to give them curricular time to develop a meaningful project based on their interests while improving health in the Bronx.\" Second-year med student Jasper Sim is already working on a health-innovation project, analyzing data to improve health systems. \"Dr. Jariwala has been a great mentor, allowing me the independence to work on this project on my own\u2014from refining my questions to analyzing the results, all the way to submitting the re - search for publication,\" he says. \"I've had some computer-programming experience, but I had never applied it to clinical re - search.

You may find there is not an opportunity there, or you may uncover something you've never seen before.\" Besides building digital tools, health - care innovation also involves the examina - tion of large amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions. Mr. Paul and his classmate Moshe Beiser have been doing just that. As part of a summer proj - ect for Dr. Jariwala, they sought to better understand the physician experience with telemedicine during the pandemic. Their research was published in August 2021 in T elemedicine and e-Health. \"Biotech innovation will change the way I practice medicine,\" Mr. Beiser says. \"It is a way we can help a broader swath of patients than just the ones we work with face-to-face. The way Dr. Jariwala approaches data will absolutely inform how I see clinical questions as they arise and how I think about the solutions.\" EXPLORING CAREER PATHS Starting with the Class of 2026, biodesign training at Einstein won't be limited to Sunit Jariwala, M.D., Einstein professor of medicine, works with medical students Moshe Beiser, left, and Jasper Sim on digital health technologies.Photo by Jason Torres44 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023 Moving basic-science discoveries out of the lab and into clinical trials isn't easy. Just ask Steven Almo, Ph.D., professor and chair of biochem - istry at Einstein. In 2011, he came up with an idea for a new form of immuno - therapy, known as Immuno-STAT, that didn't enter clinical trials until 2019. Thanks to grant support from the National Institutes of Health, he and his Einstein colleagues were able to develop Immuno-STAT into a potential therapy against cancer as well as autoimmune diseases. But then came a major hur - dle. \"We were confronting the 'Valley of Death,'\" says Dr. Almo\u2014the term describing the gap between invention and commercial application, where lack of funding dooms many advances. \"There's no shortage of scientists with good ideas for new drug technolo - gies,\" continues Dr. Almo, who is also a professor of physiology and biophysics, a co-leader of the Cancer Therapeutics Program at Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center, the Wollowick Family Foundation Chair in Multiple Sclerosis and Immunology, and the director of the Einstein Macromolecular Therapeutics Developmental Facility. \"In our case, we were fortunate that Einstein's office of biotechnology and business development understood what our innovative science could mean to patients,\" Dr. Almo says. \"It relentlessly pursued finding a licensing partner that could raise the funding needed to fur - ther develop our technology and bring it to clinical trials.\" Janis Paradiso, M.B.A., directs Einstein's office of biotechnology and business development. \"Our challenge in advancing a drug discovery is finding a champion\u2014typically a biotechnology company, a life-sciences entrepreneur, or a venture capital firm\u2014that believes in it and has the resources to develop it,\" she says. \"That partner then licenses our IP [intellectual property], hoping its investment will culminate in a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA],\" she adds. \"The licensing agreement allows us to hold the licensing partner's feet to the fire to en - sure that the drug's development is being advanced in a diligent manner.\" Over the past year, Ms. Paradiso says, Einstein has gone from having two IP assets in clinical trials to four\u2014with more in the works. \"It's an exciting time,\" she says. On the following pages, we interview the four Einstein researchers whose discoveries are currently in clinical trials, and we look into what their approval could mean for patients.Drugs to treat Ebola, osteoarthritis, and cancer are now in clinical trials thanks to research led by four Einstein scientists BY TERESA CARR ILLUSTRATIONS BY TATYANA STARIKOVA HARRIS TRANSLATING DISCOVERIES INTO THERAPIESMAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 45 KARTIK CHANDRAN: Developing a Broad-Spectrum Ebola Treatment Since 1976, some two dozen ebola - virus disease outbreaks, involving several different ebolavirus strains, are known to have occurred in Africa. The largest outbreak in recorded history\u2014the 2013-16 Western African epidemic\u2014killed more than 11,000 people and was caused by the Zaire strain. The good news is that monoclonal anti - bodies, which bind to and neutralize specific pathogens, have emerged as successful treat - ments for Ebola patients. The FDA approved two monoclonal-antibody therapies in late 2020. However, they're effective against only the Zaire strain and not the other two ebo - lavirus strains, Sudan virus and Bundibugyo virus, which have also caused major out - breaks. One of those strains\u2014Sudan virus\u2014 was responsible for the recent ebolavirus outbreak in Uganda that killed 55 people. \"The sub-Saharan region of Africa is a hot spot for these viruses,\" says Kartik Chandran, Ph.D., professor of immunology, the Gertrude and David Feinson Chair in Medicine, and the Harold and Muriel Block Faculty Scholar in Virology at Einstein. He lists other strains that have appeared in the area, in addition to the three major disease-causing ebolavi - ruses: the T a\u00ef Forest ebolavirus is known to INTO THERAPIES The Ebola therapy developed by Kartik Chandran, Ph.D., and colleagues contains two antibodies (blue and purple, at left) that bind to different regions of the virus's spike protein. 46 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023colleagues from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the biotech companies Adimab and Mapp Biopharmaceutical\u2014sifted through the antibodies from a survivor of the 2013-16 Zaire ebolavirus epidemic, looking for antibodies that recognized other ebolaviruses too. Out of 349 different antibodies tested, the researchers identified one that could neutralize the three major Ebola strains that infect humans. \"We call it the 'rain - bow unicorn' antibody,\" Dr. Chandran says. A second antibody from the same ebolavirus survivor showed promise, but it required some fine-tuning in the lab. \"Antibodies that work against ebolavirus do so by attaching to spike proteins on the viral surface that the have infected one person, the Reston strain infects nonhuman primates, and the Bombali ebolavirus has been isolated from bats. \"The development of ebolavirus therapies has proceeded slowly, in fits and starts, with most research sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense,\" Dr. Chandran says. \"Without the funding and the time to develop separate drugs for each strain of ebolavi - rus, we and others realized we needed a pan-ebolavirus drug that could treat or prevent infection caused by any of them.\" A 'RAINBOW UNICORN' The search for such a drug began in 2016. Dr. Chandran\u2014along with Kartik Chandran, Ph.D., examines a molecular model of the Ebola spike protein. microbe needs to penetrate and infect cells,\" Dr. Chandran explains. \"Thanks to our consortium's molecular engineer - ing skills, we were able to modify the second antibody's structure into a sort of skeleton key that fits onto and blocks multiple spikes.\" Lab tests showed that the two mono - clonal antibodies combined were able to neutralize all known ebolavirus strains by successfully attaching to their spike pro - teins. Then, in proof-of-concept animal studies, the two-antibody combination, dubbed MBP134, was administered to macaque monkeys that had been infected with normally fatal doses of ebolavirus. \"The antibody combination proved to be almost completely protec - tive for the virus-infected monkeys,\" Dr. Chandran said. MBP134 is being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial, and preliminary results indicate that the therapy is safe for humans. However, since Ebola outbreaks are relatively rare and unpredictable, a conventional phase 2/3 trial to evalu - ate the drug cocktail's effectiveness in patients isn't possible. Nevertheless, says Dr. Chandran, physicians in Uganda are giving the drug to a handful of patients infected in the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Sudan, under the FDA's compassion - ate-use protocol allowing unapproved drugs when no other treatments are available. Mapp Biopharmaceutical and the fed - eral government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority recently announced a contract to further develop MBP134 into an FDA-approved drug. Dr. Chandran hopes that thou - sands of doses of MBP134 will be stock - piled before the next outbreak. \"Lives depend on our being able to deploy it quickly,\" he says. TRANSLATING DISCOVERIES Photo by Jason TorresMAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 47JOEL FRIEDMAN: Harnessing an Ancient Remedy If you had wandered into Einstein's Falk Center seven years ago, you might have overhead Joel Friedman, M.D., Ph.D.\u2014a regular in the gym's noontime pickup basketball games\u2014extolling the virtues of curcumin, a derivative of the gold-colored herb turmeric. \"I hadn't been able to play basketball for several months because my knees hurt so much from osteoarthritis,\" recalls Dr. Friedman, professor of microbiology & immunology and of medicine at Einstein. \"My orthopedist had nothing to offer except suggesting I take up shuffleboard instead.\" But then a postdoctoral student in Dr. Friedman's lab told him that his grandfather, a healer in India, applied a mixture of curcumin and coconut oil to aching joints. The remedy seemed to make sense: Dr. Friedman found hundreds of papers published on the health benefits of curcumin, most notably its anti- inflammatory quality. \"After I started applying curcumin plus coconut oil to my knees\u2014voil\u00e0!\u2014I was able to play basketball again and resume doing Chinese martial arts,\" he recalls. \"It made me think that curcumin might have real potential as an osteoarthritis drug. But as I read the studies exploring curcumin as a therapy, I realized that they'd all hit the same wall: No matter how much curcumin An artist's illustration of how curcumin, when applied as an ointment to the knee, penetrates the skin to deliver relief for arthritis pain. 48 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023A promising new therapy's journey from the lab to the clinic is long, expensive, and often doomed to failure. It generally takes 10 to 15 years and can cost as much as $2.6 billion. Only about one in eight drugs evaluated in human trials ultimately gains marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). DISCOVERY: The early stages of a drug's development typically take the most time and effort. Researchers often must screen thousands of compounds before discovering one with potential. At that point, the compound moves on to preclinical studies to see if it appears safe and effective when used in animal models of human diseases. The discovery and preclinical phases are usually supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health or by philanthropy. But for compounds to progress further, institu - tions such as Einstein must usually license them to biotechnology companies or other in - vestors who are able to pay for the further development, including clinical trials needed for FDA approval. LICENSING AGREEMENTS: Licensing such compounds benefits the researchers who discovered them and their institutions, says Janis Paradiso, M.B.A., director of Einstein's office of biotechnology and business development. At Einstein, she explains, one-third of the distributable net revenue from licensing agreements typically goes to the inven - tors personally, one-third to their labs, and one-third to the College of Medicine. \"It's a virtuous cycle,\" she says. \"Einstein reinvests its proceeds into research and science, propelling the development of future treatments.\" PHASE 1: The earliest clinical studies are phase 1 trials, which typically involve 20 to 100 healthy volunteers or people with the disease or condition. They focus on evaluating a drug for safety, including determining a safe dosage range. If phase 1 studies, which generally take several months, go well, it's on to phase 2. About 70% of drugs in phase 1 trials move to the next phase, according to the FDA. PHASE 2: Phase 2 trials may involve multiple medical centers that enroll hundreds of patients affected by the condition the drug is intended to treat. Those studies further assess safety but focus mainly on effectiveness. These trials take several months to two years to complete. PHASE 3: If the first two phases suggest that a drug is both safe and effective, phase 3 clinical trials\u2014usually multicenter trials involving thousands of patients\u2014can start. In addition to monitoring for safety and effectiveness, phase 3 trials may also compare the drug with an already-approved drug for treating the same condition. Such trials require one to four years to complete. When a new medication finally makes it to the finish line of FDA approval, the biggest winners, of course, are the patients who can benefit from it. TRAVELING THE ROAD FROM BENCH TO BEDSIDE 48 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 49you ingest with pills, or how much you rub on your skin, the body doesn't absorb it too well.\" FINDING THE THIRD INGREDIENT Studying the yellow curcumin concoction in his lab, Dr. Friedman discovered that fatty acids in coconut oil transported only small amounts of curcumin through the skin and into the joint. What was needed, he realized, was a third ingredient: a solvent capable of dissolving high concentrations of curcumin and its fatty-acid carrier. Finding one proved quite a challenge, since nearly all good solvents for curcumin aren't safe to use. Finally\u2014after a period of testing and aided by his previous research on nanoparticles\u2014he arrived at a formula for safely delivering an effective dose of curcumin through the skin. Dr. Friedman connected with entrepreneurs, who formed Vascarta, a company that licensed the technology from Einstein with the goal of developing it into a drug. A safe and effective topical drug for joint pain could be a boon for the 31 million Americans who suffer from osteoarthritis, the most common disability among adults. Many of them rely on oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can cause serious side effects. Diclofenac, the only topical FDA-approved drug for arthritis pain, is also an NSAID; for safety reasons, the name-brand drug Voltaren and other topical diclofenac products should not be applied for more than 21 days. So far, Dr. Friedman's curcumin compound has been patented and has progressed through animal studies and a phase 1 trial in India to assess safety. A phase 2 trial involving osteoarthritis patients is being planned. Although reduced joint pain would be the trial's pri - mary outcome, Dr. Friedman believes his compound's benefits may extend beyond the joints: The preclinical studies, he says, detected curcumin in the bloodstream after the product was topically applied. \"Curcumin triggers tissues to produce the signaling molecule nitric oxide, which may be a magic bullet for a number of conditions,\" says Dr. Friedman. \"One of nitric oxide's best-known effects is vasodi - lation, which suggests that boosting nitric oxide levels via curcumin could potential - ly lower blood pressure and treat systemic problems caused by sickle-cell disease.\" He also points to studies suggesting that nitric oxide may reduce systemic inflam - mation, a contributor to heart disease, cancer, and diabetes as well as arthritis. \"I have no doubt that prescription drugs based on curcumin will one day make it to the market,\" Dr. Friedman says. \"We hope to get our product there first.\"\"Curcumin triggers tissues to produce the signaling molecule nitric oxide, which may be a magic bullet for a number of conditions.\" \u2014 DR.

The first of Dr. Zang's cancer- fighting ICIs to make it to clinical trials is a monoclonal antibody called TQB2618, which binds to the T-cell checkpoint receptor known as Tim-3. By binding to the Tim-3 receptor, the antibody \"locks out\" three different molecules that tumor cells deploy to bind to Tim-3 and put the now being evaluated in clinical trials in China. Dr. Zang has also launched three start-up companies in the United States and Israel to develop early drug proto - types. \"He keeps our office busy,\" Ms. Paradiso says. Dr. Zang is a professor in the depart - ments of microbiology & immunology, oncology, medicine, and urology and the Louis Goldstein Swan Chair in Women's Cancer Research at Einstein, and a member of the National Cancer Institute-designated Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center. His postdoctoral mentor, James P . Allison, Ph.D., shared the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for coming up with the idea for ICIs and developed Yervoy, the first of nine ICIs now on the market. Today's ICIs have succeeded against cancers that once were intractable. Previously, for example, patients with metastatic melanoma lived an average of only seven months following diag - nosis; now, some melanoma patients XINGXING ZANG: Zang, M.Med., Ph.D., develops immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)\u2014monoclonal antibodies that unleash the full power of the immune system to attack a wide range of human cancers. \"Unlike surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, ICIs are immunotherapies, meaning they enlist the body's own immune system to attack tumors,\" says Dr. Zang. \"It is the future\u2014a completely different approach to cancer treatment.\" Dr. Zang has already patented more than 10 ICIs, most of which have been licensed by biotechnology companies for further development.

A leading Chinese drug company, the Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group, is sponsoring several trials of TQB2618 in China. A phase 1 trial of TQB2618 demon - strated its safety in advanced cancer patients in 2021. Now seven new clinical trials are studying the drug in various types of cancer, including both solid cancers and blood cancers: A phase 2 trial in patients with cancer of the nasopharynx (the area behind the nose and above the throat) who haven't responded to standard treatment; Four phase 1/2 trials \u2014hybrid trials that are designed to look at safety, efficacy, and dosage\u2014in patients with recurrent/ metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, small-cell lung cancer, head and neck HOW TO TURN T CELLS LOOSE Sprouting from T cells and other immune cells are proteins called \"checkpoint\" receptors. When they make contact with proteins in the body's own cells, the inter - action prevents a possible auto - immune reaction. Diabolically, most types of cancer cells express proteins and other molecules aimed at inactivating T cells by binding to their checkpoint receptors. In the illustration on the facing page, a tumor cell (at left) has de - ployed three different molecules to inactivate a T cell (at right) by stimulating its Tim-3 checkpoint receptors (purple). Two of the tumor molecules are the secreted proteins galectin-9 and HMGB- 1 (blue and yellow); the is phosphotidylserine (green), a cell-surface phospholipid. The immune-checkpoint inhibi - tor TQB2618, now in clinical trials against several types of cancer, stops tumor molecules from shut - ting down T cells. The illustration shows that TQB2618 molecules (pink) have bound to the T cell's purple Tim-3 receptors, thereby preventing any of the tumor mol - ecules from doing so. Protected from inactivation, the T cell can now attack cancers.cancer, or lymphoma (a cancer of the lymphatic system); and T wo phase 1 clinical trials , one in - volving late-stage melanoma patients, the other in patients with recurrent/refractory acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplas - tic syndromes (cancers of the blood and bone marrow). Early in 2023, another of Dr. Zang's ICIs, the first of its kind, will begin a phase 1 trial in the United States for the treatment of several types of solid tumors. The trial is sponsored by NextPoint Therapeutics in Cambridge, Mass., of which Dr. Zang is the scientific co-founder. \"I'm hopeful that in a decade, checkpoint inhibitors will have become a standard treatment for many forms of cancer,\" Dr. Zang says.Xingxing by Jason Torres52 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023 STEVEN ALMO: Confronting Diseases by Tweaking T Cells By training, Einstein professor Steven Almo, Ph.D., is a struc - tural biologist who uses X-ray crystallography to study the structure and function of molecules. His expertise has led to collaborations with research - ers modifying proteins to create new therapies and with other researchers studying molecules that control the immune system. One day in 2010, those collaborations inspired what he calls \"a crazy idea\" for an experiment. \"That will never work,\" he recalls a colleague telling him. \"You're right,\" agreed Dr. Almo. \"But let's try it anyway.\" The crazy idea was to mimic what the immune system does naturally when confronted with a potential danger such as a cancer cell: activate a select group of T cells to go on the attack. Today's immunotherapies\u2014check - point-inhibitor drugs such as Keytruda and Opdivo\u2014can cause serious side effects because they activate all the ILLUSTRATION IN PROGRESSTRAINING T CELLS TO TARGET AND TERMINATE TUMORS Anticancer Immuno-STAT proteins are designed to selec - tively activate \"disease-relevant\" T cells, avoiding the gen - eralized, life-threatening T-cell reactions that other drugs can trigger. Immuno-STAT CUE-101, pictured here, rallies T cells to attack recurrent metastatic head and neck can - cers caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) 16. Such a tumor (bottom of illustration) displays antigenic fragments of HPV 16's E7 protein (red) and can be recognized by T cells possessing receptors for the E7 protein (green). To find those specific T cells, CUE-101 molecules have two \"targeting arms\" (blue); each arm is equipped with E7 protein fragments (red) that enable CUE-101 to prefer - entially bind T cells (see large cell at center) that have E7-specific receptors. Then CUE-101's \"activating arms\"\u2014 each with two copies of IL-2 (turquoise), a potent cytokine- signaling protein\u2014swing into action. Just as occurs during natural immune responses, IL-2 activates the T cells by binding to their IL-2 receptors (purple), causing the target - ed T cells to proliferate and boosting their aggressiveness as they home in on and kill head-and-neck cancer cells. 52 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 53body's T cells, triggering an overzealous immune response that extends to healthy organs and tissues. A targeted T-cell response would ideally kill cancer cells without endangering the patient. But creating a molecule to switch on specific T cells is complicated, says Dr. Almo. \"I suspect that others had the same idea but talked themselves out of it, assuming it would be too challenging to make such a molecule.\" TARGETING T CELLS TO TREAT DISEASES Dr. Almo's idea was to synthesize fusion proteins equipped with two pairs of arms; one pair would bind only to those T cells pertinent to a patient's disease, while the other would tell the disease-related T cells what to do. (See illustration on opposite page.) That strategy could potentially treat many diseases in which T cells play a role. For treating prostate cancer, for example, the fusion protein would be tailored to seek out prostate-cancer- relevant T cells and then, with its sec - ond pair of arms, stimulate those T cells to replicate and infiltrate the tumor; for an autoimmune disease such as lupus, the fusion protein's second pair of arms would be programmed to suppress, rather than stimulate, T-cell activity that would injure the body. \"To our surprise and delight we were able to make these fusion proteins and demonstrate in a test tube that they could kill specific T cells or make other T cells proliferate,\" says Dr. Almo. \"Those were the basic studies that led to the founding of the biopharmaceutical company Cue Biopharma and its li - censing of our discovery from Einstein, which eventually led to clinical trials.\" Cue Biopharma, Inc., has advanced Dr. Almo's technology, known as Immuno-STAT, through animal studies to clinical trials. In a two-arm, phase 1 multicenter trial that began in 2019, Cue Biopharma is evaluating an Immuno-STAT drug product named CUE-101 in patients with recurrent, metastatic head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) 16. In the first part of the study, patients are treated with CUE- 101 alone; in the second arm, patients receive CUE-101 together with the checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda. A phase 2 study of CUE-101, un - derway at the Washington University School of Medicine, involves patients with newly diagnosed, locally advanced oropharyngeal squamous-cell carci - noma caused by HPV 16. Patients are receiving CUE-101 as neoadjuvant therapy (treatment intended to shrink tumors) one month before undergoing surgery for tumor removal. \"This study is especially important,\" says Dr. Almo, \"because examining the excised tumors allows you to actually see how CUE-101 has affected them.\" A tweak to CUE-101 has created a second Immuno-STAT drug, CUE- 102. It's designed to treat cancers in which the protein Wilms' tumor 1 is overexpressed\u2014a common occurrence in solid tumors such as breast, lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer and in blood cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia. Since the FDA found that CUE-101 has a \"favorable tolerability profile,\" the agency has allowed a phase 1 trial of CUE-102 to begin at a much higher initial dose. \"This significantly speeds up clinical development,\" says Dr. Almo, saving nearly a year on studies that would otherwise be needed to find the highest safe dose. \"What's most exciting to me,\" he adds, \"is that Montefiore Einstein is one of the sites where the CUE-102 clinical trial will be conducted.\" Steven Almo, Ph.D., develops drugs to selectively turn T cells on.

After graduating from the City University of New York's Hunter College, where he met his wife, Mintra Sukal, M.D. '00, he was elated to be accepted to Einstein. But as an international student, he wasn't eligible for government loans like the ones that financed his wife's education. Without the scholarship he received from Einstein, says Dr. Sean Sukal, his family could not have afforded medical school. \"My dad would have had to sell our family's land in T rinidad,\" he says. \"Thank God he didn't have to.\" Now, to help other aspiring physi - cians realize their dreams, the couple has established the Sukal Family Endowed Scholarship Fund, which will help defray tuition costs for medical students with financial need. Sitting side by side in their living room in Boca Raton, Fla., the Sukals, pictured on the facing page, above right, explain how they were inspired by a new MOTIVATIONS | PHILANTHROPY An anonymous donor's generosity will help Einstein attract and retain tomorrow's leaders\u2014 and has already inspired others to give BY TERESA CARR MAGAZINE.EINSTEINMED.EDU 57$15 million scholarship gift to Einstein. That donation, from an anonymous benefactor, consists of two parts: a $10 million outright gift for student support, plus another $5 million endowment that will match other donations ranging from $50,000 to $250,000. The one-to-one match is \"amazing,\" says Dr. Mintra Sukal as her husband nods enthusiastically. \"Supporting scholarships is something that we've al - ways thought of doing,\" he adds. \"The opportunity to double our contribu - tion convinced us to make it happen.\" Einstein sorely needs scholarship funds to compete with other medical schools in recruiting talented students, especially those from groups histori - cally underrepresented in medicine, says Joshua Nosanchuk, M.D., senior associate dean for medical education at Einstein. \"Promising students may choose to go elsewhere\u2014or not go to medical school at all\u2014for financial reasons.\" The Sukals credit their success to the support they received from Einstein and now want to extend a hand to others. \"The idea that it takes a village to raise our young doesn't end with elementary school,\" says Dr. Sean Sukal. \"It's true of medical school, too.\" MULTIPLYING THE GOOD The anonymous donor is strength - ening the Einstein community of donors by inspiring others to establish endowed scholarships in their own names. The philosophy behind the match is that it will create a perpetual loop of generosity, inspiring alumni to support incoming Einstein medical students for generations to come. Like the Sukals, many other \"The idea that it takes a village to raise our young doesn't end with elementary school. It's true of medical school, too.\" \u2014 DR. SEAN SUKAL Pilar Ph.D., have created an endowed scholarship.Einstein alumni seem to have been waiting for the right opportunity to donate. In a 2022 feasibility study of nearly 100 alumni, 84% reported that student support through scholarships is their top priority for philanthrop - ic giving. And 42 Einstein alumni, including 10 of the 40 members of the alumni board of directors, have already taken advantage of the new $5 million endowment to create their own named scholarships. Donors to date include Sten Vermund, M.D. '77, epide - miologist who recently stepped down as dean of the Yale School of Public Health to return to teaching and research, and his wife, Pilar Vargas, M.D. '77, Ph.D., a retired child psy - chiatrist. \"It's human nature to want to multiply a good,\" says Dr. Vermund, co-chair of the alumni board's devel - opment subcommittee and member of the Einstein Alumni Association's board of governors. \"The generous gift of matching funds helps us do that in a substantial way.\" Drs. Vermund and Vargas chose to double their impact with an endowed scholarship in honor of Einstein's Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean, Gordon Tomaselli, M.D. '82. The fund remains open to new donations. Einstein has some catching up to do when it comes to fundraising for student support, says Dr. Vermund. In comparison, he points to the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, where tuition is free, and to other peer institutions that keep student debt more manageable. Einstein's current leadership has done a great job of turning the ship around, says Dr. Vermund. \"Now I hope that we can 58 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023 sail out under full steam, bringing the alumni and friends of the institution along to support the Einstein educa - tional mission.\" LIGHTENING THE LOAD OF STUDENT DEBT Raja Flores, M.D. '92, was excited to join other alumni when he estab - lished the Raja Flores, M.D., Endowed Scholarship. As chair of thoracic surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, Dr. Flores treats everyone\u2014 from the wealthiest patients to those experiencing homelessness. He credits Einstein with instilling the ethos that patients from all walks of life deserve the same compassion, dignity, and respect. Dr. Flores himself almost chose a more affordable medical school. But then he read an inscription on the wall of Einstein's Belfer Building: There is no great - er privilege than to be entrusted with another person's mind, body, and spirit. \"I fell in love with the place,\" he says. \"I decided to take out loans and whatever else it took to go here.\" Today, many Einstein students take on significant debt to follow their hearts. As of 2020 nearly half of Einstein students graduated with $200,000 or more of debt, compared to an average of only 17% of students at other local medical schools. Beginning their careers with so much debt takes a toll on new physicians\u2014as well as on the field of medicine itself. A 2019 review of 52 studies published in the British Medical Journal found that high medical debt negatively affects stu - dents' mental health and lowers academ - ic performance. Typically, residents and interns make very little money, says Dr. Nosanchuk. \"Having that large debt looming over them when they're working \"I see others like me out there, and I want to help them realize their dreams.\" \u2014 DR. RAJA FLORES really hard and trying to make ends meet is disheartening,\" he says. \"Graduating with low or no debt increases people's wellness not just while they're students, but also throughout their residencies and training.\" The British Medical Journal analysis found that the fear of burdensome debt discourages students from pursuing lower-paying specialties such as infectious disease. Last year only 56% of training programs for infectious-disease physicians in the United States filled their trainee slots, compared with 90% of most other specialties. The chief barrier: high prior debt combined with low compensation, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America. SUPPORTING GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS Coming from a low-income family shouldn't dictate a student's choice of a medical school or specialty, says the anon - ymous benefactor. That's why the focus of the donation is on students with financial need, with an emphasis on supporting those students who are least able to afford tuition at Einstein. That's what motivates Dr. Flores, too. \"I see others like me out there,\" he says, \"and I want to help them realize their dreams.\" The Sukals' story is a testament to the tremendous dividends that an investment in an Einstein education can yield. Dr. Sean Sukal blazed a trail for physicians of color in dermatology, a field in which only about 7% of U.S. practitioners are Black or Hispanic. \"We are so grateful for the education, training, and life experience we received at Einstein,\" says Dr. Mintra Sukal, a ra - diologist. \"We're just so happy to be able to give back.\" TO DONATE To contribute to the Dean Tomaselli Scholarship\u2014or create your own\u2014 contact Min Um-Mandhyan, senior director of alumni relations and development, at: min.um-mandhyan@einsteinmed.edu.

SABRIYA STUKES As a doctoral student at Einstein, Sabriya Stukes, Ph.D. '14, worked in the lab of Arturo Casadevall, M.D., Ph.D., then chair of the depart - ment of microbiology & immunology. Dr. Casadevall, now at Johns Hopkins, was doing basic research on a fungal pathogen called Cryptococcus neoformans , and \"he really stressed the importance of creating a diverse laboratory environ - ment and sharing your scientific work with as many people as possible,\" Dr. Stukes recalls. \"And that was true of Einstein generally. Going to grad school in the Bronx gave me a unique perspec - tive on scientific collaborations and how science coming out of an academic institution could affect people's lives.\" Dr. Stukes did not become a basic- science researcher. After Einstein she held a series of different jobs, including helping build a national platform to accelerate scientific collaborations, de - signing a new master's degree program in translational medicine for the City College of New York, and directing operations for a small biotech compa - ny. Today she serves as chief scientific officer for IndieBio NY , a start-up development program that supports early-stage founders who want to turn their scientific ideas into successful biotech companies. Still, the outlook that Dr. Casadevall and Einstein imparted remains central to her work. \"People bringing new scientific ideas to market tend not to realize that inter - esting laboratory data don't always trans - late into a sustainable business idea,\" she says. \"So it's really important that scientists and engineers ask the right questions when thinking about bringing their technologies to market. Are they truly meeting an unmet need? Can they make a compelling case for funding?\" AN IDEAL TRAINING GROUND Amid a global pandemic, climate change, and other challenges to human and planetary health, the skills required to bring new solutions to market have never been more important. But the United States, while remaining the world leader in basic research, is slipping when it comes to application. Currently 90% of biotech start-ups fail, and an even higher percentage of new medicines in development never make it to market, with many falling victim to the \"Valley of Death\"\u2014the de - velopmental phase between lab work and clinical trials, where funding is scarce. Dr. Stukes believes that the key to improving that track record is recruiting and developing the right people, and that Ph.D. programs like Einstein's can be ideal training grounds. \"There's a stereotype that people with Ph.D.s don't make good entrepreneurs because we don't know how to pivot and adjust in the real world,\" she says. \"I think the opposite is true. We're trained to solve problems, create original bodies of work, and become experts in our disciplines, and we often lead our own research efforts. Plus, we know more about failure than most people because most of our exper - iments don't work, or they give us unex - pected results. It's what we do with those results that makes all the difference.\" The latter attribute is key. Successful start-ups are often those that modify their original concepts in response to the feedback that Ph.D. programs with savvy tech-transfer offices can provide. And although most scientific experiments may fail, Einstein has developed a nationally 62 EINSTEIN : WINTER/SPRING 2023recognized career and professional de - velopment program to help its graduates bring those experiments that are success - ful to fruition. EXPANDING CAREER POSSIBILITIES The office of biotechnology and busi - ness development, led by Janis Paradiso, M.B.A., and the career and professional development for graduate students and postdocs program, directed by Diane Safer, Ph.D., offer practical learning opportunities. \"Not only have things changed at Einstein; they've also changed in the biomedical workforce environment,\" notes Victoria Freedman, Ph.D., associate dean for graduate programs in biomedical sciences. \"The expecta - tion now\u2014and this is coming from the National Institutes of Health [NIH] and the National Science Foundation\u2014is that Ph.D. programs will also be op - portunities for career exploration and advancement. \"We encourage our Ph.Ds. to learn about the wide range of careers available to them and to take advantage of all the opportunities out there,\" Dr. Freedman continues. \"We bring a lot of people in to discuss all aspects of business development, intellectual property, and even venture capital. We also have a business and tech - nology internship to give students experi - ence in the business transfer process.\" That's the role that Einstein has played for Adam Kramer, Ph.D. '19, a senior scientist at MicroCures , a New York City biotech firm that is developing a new therapy that can recruit cells to damaged tissue in order to accelerate healing\u2014or, conversely, help prevent cancer by stopping cell migration.Dr. Kramer came to Einstein knowing that he wanted to work in biotech. His father ran Africa's largest science museum, and his family had a history of cancer. Here on a Fulbright scholarship, he chose Einstein because several of its labs were doing work with an applied focus. Through the Biotechnology Club at the College of Medicine, he attended a talk by David Sharp, Ph.D., professor of molecular pharmacology, of ophthalmology & visual sciences, and in the Dominick P . Purpura Department of Neuroscience, who was then in the process of found - ing MicroCures. Soon afterward he joined Dr. Sharp's lab, where students were studying different applications for Dr. Sharp's work, ranging from treatments for skin wounds to cancer and erectile dysfunction. \"The only people in the world who understand the biology we're working on and have the skills to translate it come from Dave's academic lab\u2014so his lab is effective - ly the training station for the company,\" Dr. Kramer says. \"Einstein also has given us lab and office space on campus, as it has for several other companies, and I still work with Dave's students. From my perspective, Einstein has a great culture in biotech.\" Although MicroCures does not yet have a marketed product, it seems clear that Dr. Sharp and his team are making the right moves. The new therapy has worked in animal models, and the company is now raising funds for its first human trials. \"Dave understands that scientists are very good at the research in their fields, but he also knows that business acumen is just as important,\" says Dr. Kramer, whose job focuses on obtaining small-business innovation grants MOTIVATIONS | CAREERS IN BASIC SCIENCE \"The only people in the world who understand the biology we're working on and have the skills to translate it come from Dave's academic lab.\" \u2014 DR.

Donors can step in and provide the funds to try these exciting ideas, which often lead to more grants or even new businesses.\" For Einstein graduate Dr. Stukes, again, it all comes back to investing in people. \"Medical and research institutions need to understand that just because you're getting a Ph.D., it doesn't nec - essarily mean you want to start your own lab,\" Dr. Stukes says. \"People get Ph.D.s for a variety of reasons and want different careers, and it's important for institutions to support those careers, whether through the career-development office or through student-association offices. It can't just be on the students to form specialized clubs and cobble the information together for themselves.\" Perhaps most of all, programs need to recognize that entrepreneurs like Dr. Stukes herself may wander a bit before they understand where they're headed\u2014and that their openness is part of what makes them good experi - menters and pivoters. \"All of life is an experiment and, in a sense, there are no failures,\" she says. \"You always get data that are useful in making your next move, and ultimately it's the sum of all of your experiences that helps you in whatever role you're in.\" TO DONATE einsteinmed.edu/giving development@einsteinmed.edu 718.430.2411\"Donors can step in and provide the funds to try these exciting ideas, which often lead to more grants or even new businesses.\" \u2014 DR.

Standing, from left: Marcus D. Kogel, M.D., dean of the College of Medicine, and Martin Cherkasky, M.D., director of Montefiore Hospital. Seated, from left: Jacob W. Schwab, president of Montefiore Hospital, and Samuel Belkin, Ph.D., president of Yeshiva University. In 1969, Montefiore took over the operation of Einstein's Jack D. Weiler Hospital, which today is part of Montefiore Health System's Einstein campus. Montefiore became Einstein's University Hospital and academic medical center in 2009, when the two institutions signed a new agreement reflecting their expanding partnership. Then, in 2015, a historic agreement was signed, which transferred finan - cial and operational responsibili - ty for the College of Medicine to Montefiore. 1963: Einstein Signs Agreement With MontefioreA LOOKBACKEINSTEIN IMAGE Metastasis (the spread of cancer from a primary tumor to other parts of the body) causes 90% of cancer deaths. Wenjun Guo, Ph.D., and colleagues found that mutations in MLL3 (a gene frequently mutated or deleted in breast cancer and other human cancers) allow cancer cells to reversibly switch between epithelial and mesenchymal cell states\u2014transitions crucial for enabling cancer cells to adapt to the changing microenvironments they confront on the way to forming metastases. In a key experiment, the researchers generated mouse mammary stem-cell organoids (clumps of mostly epithelial cells) in which MLL3 was deleted. As shown here, the MLL3 deletions caused many of the epithelial cells (green) to upregulate the mesenchymal marker vimentin (red), indicating the cells' partial transition to the mesenchymal state. When transitional cells were injected into the tail veins of mice, they readily seeded in the lungs and formed metastases. The researchers also found that BET (bromodomain and extraterminal) protein inhibitors target MLL3 -mutant cells in various types of cancer. The findings were published in January 2023 in Nature Cell Biolog y. Dr. Guo is an associate professor of cell biology at Einstein.
