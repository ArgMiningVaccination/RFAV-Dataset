Photos in this publication are courtesy of Doug Haight, photographer, and illustrate programs from recent Foster G. McGaw Prize-winning organizations. Since 1986, the Foster G. McGaw Prize has honored health delivery organizations that have demonstrated exceptional commitment to community service. The 2014 Prize is sponsored by The Baxter International Foundation, the American Hospital Association and the Health Research & Educational Trust.Today, more than 5,000 hospitals of all kinds \u2014 urban and rural, large and small \u2014 are making their communities healthier in ways that are as diverse as the needs of each community. The men and women who work in hospitals are not just mending bodies. Their work extends far beyond the literal and figurative four walls of the hospital to where free clinics, job training efforts, smoking cessation classes, back-to-school immunizations, literacy programs and so many others are brought directly to the people of the community... often with very little fanfare.This book highlights the unique and innovative ways hospitals are doing this work. Far from a comprehensive list, Community Connections begins to illustrate where and how hospitals are meeting their communities' many needs. The stories cover four broad categories: \u008b Social and Basic Needs \u008b Health Promotion \u008b Access and Coverage \u008b Quality of Life Every day in America's hospitals, there is tremendous good being done. The instantly recognizable blue and white \"H\" sign signifies more than a place that patients and families can depend on for care. It signifies the heart of a community.community connections1Table of Contents \u008b Social and Basic Needs ............................................................................................................. 3 \u008b Health Promotion ...................................................................................................................... 11 \u008b Access and Coverage .............................................................................................................. 21 \u008b Quality of Life 29 \u008b Index ..................................................................................................................................................... 37American Hospital Association 27community connections3 Social and Basic Needs Non-medical needs are often intricately tied to personal health and well-being.

Lancaster County residents who are uninsured, underinsured or lack connection within their health care and instead utilize the ED for non-emergent needs. Why do they do it?
