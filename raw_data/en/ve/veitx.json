RENEWAL REMINDER Licenses that expire September 15, 2010, are due by August 15, 2010, and can be renewed any time afterJuly 15, 2010. Licenses that expire October 15, 2010, are due by September 15, 2010, and can be renewed any timeafter August 15, 2010. Licenses that expire November 15, 2010, are due by October 15, 2010, and can be renewed any timeafter September 15, 2010. A $50 late fee is required for licensees who renew within the 30 days after the license lapses.Licenses that are not renewed will automatically beplaced on inactive status on the 16th of the monthfollowing the expiration of the license. REMINDER TO NURSES IN BORDER STATES WHO ARE WORKING IN IOWA The Nurse Licensure Compact requires nurses whose primary state of residence is a compact state,to hold an active license in that state. This allows thelicensee to practice in any other compact state. However, such persons cannot , by law, hold a cur- rent license in any compact state other than the pri-mary state of residence. Thus, persons whose primarystate of residence is South Dakota, Nebraska, Wiscon-sin, and, more recently, Missouri, must hold a currentlicense in the primary state, but cannot hold a currentIowa license. Those individuals will be practicing inIowa based on the license in the primary state.COMING SOON! INCREASED ACCESS FOR LICENSEES, CANDIDATES, EMPLOYERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC The Iowa Board of Nursing is working to migrate nursing data to a new database software that willallow increased access and immediate responses tomost of the board's business. - RN and LPN exam candidates will be able to submit applications for initial license on-line.Approvals to sit for the exam will beuploaded automatically every night to theNCSBN, exam results will be downloadednightly resulting in a faster processing time. - RN and LPN applicants for licensure by endorsement will be able to submit applica-tions on-line for initial Iowa license. - Renewals, late renewals, and reactivations will be available on-line. - ARNPs will be able to apply for initial registra- tion or renew a registration on-line. - Applicants will be able to determine whether required hard copy items (such as transcriptsor fingerprint cards) have been received andlogged. - Employers will be able to create an account, identify employees, and enroll for automaticnotification when an employee is due forrenewal, has an expired license, or is disci-plined. - Facilities that are audited will be able to respond on-line. - The general public will be able to create an account, create data sets for download, andpay on-line. All that will be required is a current unique e-mail address as a user i.d., and a current credit card forthose conducting business that requires a payment.All credit card transactions will be handled by USBank; no state employee at any level will have accessto credit card information. The board has been working toward this solution for several years, and is excited to be nearing the go-live date which is targeted for November.

Use the following contacts for specific questions. If you inquire about your licensure sta- tus or request written materials, provide the following information at the beginning of the call/message: Iowa license number, full name, mailing address, and phone number includ- ing area code.LICENSE RENEWAL . . . ONLINE The Iowa Board of Nursing has made renewing licenses easier for many nurses in Iowa through online license renewal. Although many nurses are taking advantage of this service, there are still many more nurses who could benefit from it. There are many advantages to online renewal including: It is easy. Just go to the website at: w ww.iowa.go v/nursing All you need is your license number, social security number, date of birth, MasterCard, VISA or a debit card. Answer all the questions. Pay the $104.00 fee, which includes a $5.00 online convenience fee. It is fast. Once the online renewal process is complete your license is immediately renewed and will be mailed in three to five working days. It is convenient. You can renew on your computer at home, at midnight or on a holi- day if you choose. If you do not have a computer at home, you could renew on the computer at your local library or at your work place. Your information is secured/masked to protect your privacy. Online renewal reduces errors. The system will not let you move forward until all questions are answered. Online renewal is available for RNs and LPNs only. Late online renewal is also available through the 15th of the month following the expiration date on the wallet card. Fee = $154.00. Please note that the Board does not automatically mail renewal forms or notices to nurs- es whose licenses are due for renewal. We encourage all nurses to consider going online to apply for renewal. We think you will be surprised at how easy it is.Page 4 - Iowa Board of Nursing Newsletter - August, September, October 2010August, September, October 2010 - Iowa Board of Nursing Newsletter - Page 5 AL TERNATE METHODS TO VERIFY A NURSING LICENSE Employers/Public (No Charge) If you or your organization needs to verify a nurse license status and/or check a nurse's discipline status for employ- ment decisions, then you may want to consider the National Council of State Boards of Nursing's secure, online verification system, Nur sys\u00ae(www.nursys.com). The nursys.com Web site contains data obtained directly from the licensure systems of multiple boards of nursing through frequent, secured updates. Employers and the general public can now verify licenses and receive a detailed report within minutes, free of charge. This report will contain the name, jurisdiction(s), license type, license number(s), compact status (multistate/single state), license status, expiration date, discipline against license and discipline against privilege to practice (PTP) of the nurse being verified. Currently, nursys.com is the only verification tool available that provides status of a multistate licensee's privilege to practice in remote Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) jurisdictions. Nurses (Official License Verification for a Fee) When a nurse applies for endorsement into a state, verifi- cation of existing or previously held licenses may be required. A nurse can use Nursys.com to request verification of licen- sure from a Nur syslicensure participating board. A list of licensure participating nursing boards can be found at Nursys.com. In order to be eligible for a multistate license in the Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC), the nurse must legally reside in an NLC state. An active, unencumbered, multistate license allows the nurse to practice in all NLC jurisdictions. Ques- tions about NLC eligibility and legal residency can be direct- ed to the board of nursing in the nurse's state of residency. Verifications can be processed by completing the online Nur sysverification process. The fee for this service is $30.00 per license type for each state board of nursing where the nurse is applying. Nur syslicense verification is sent to the endorsing board immediately. Please visit w ww.nursy s.com for more details. For more information, email nursy s@ncsbn.or g, caIl (312) 525-3780 or visit Nursys.com.

Can- didates for licensure by examination are notified in writing of their test result. The Iowa Board of Nursing verifies Iowa licensure status through the automated telephone system on the first or second Wednesday afternoon following the test date if all the following have occurred: the candidate has applied for licensure in Iowa the candidate has passed the examination the NCLEX\u00ae result has been transmitted to the board by the test service Telephone Verification To verify licensure in Iowa, call 515-281-3255 and press 2 for initial licensure by exam information, press 2 again for exam results information. Now you will be prompted to the automated verification system. Through the verification sys- tem you will either be notified that a license is active and pro- vided an expiration date or the system will state \"invalid selection\" which means your exam results have not been processed or you did not pass the NCLEX exam. Pressing 1 transfers to the automated verification system. License num- bers are not released. Questions may be directed to 515-281-6488 or newnurs@io wa.go v.NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT The Iowa Board of Nursing is pleased to be a member of the nurse licensure compact. This new form of licensure and regulation will better protect the public by: Allowing competent nurses to provide care both physical- ly and electronically wherever care is needed; Providing the public ready access to and a choice of qual- ified nurses; Protecting clients against incompetent nurses or unsafe nursing care through better communication between boards of nursing, cooperative disciplinary investigations and prompt reporting of disciplinary action; Benefiting employers of nurses by having a more mobile workforce and a convenient centralized database for verifica- tion of licensure credentials. Understanding the Basics The nurse licensure compact allows a nurse who resides in a compact state to hold ONE license in the nurse's primary state of residence and practice in all other states in which the compact is in effect. Primary state of residence is where the nurse holds a driver's license, pays taxes and/or votes. The compact requires the nurse to practice according to the laws and regulations of the state in which the nurse provides care where the patient is located at the time the care is provided. The practice laws and regulations for many states are available online. A nurse who is under discipline may be in a monitoring agreement, which restricts practice across state lines. If you hold a license in a COMPACT state and RESIDE in that COMPACT state, your license is a multistate license which authorizes you to practice in any other compact state. If you hold a license in a COMPACT state, but do not RESIDE in that compact state (reside in a non-compact state), your license is a single state license and it authorizes you to practice only in that compact state. For example, if you hold an Iowa nursing license, but do not live in Iowa, the license is a single state license and does not grant you the privilege to practice in any other state. If you are licensed in both Iowa and another compact state and RESIDE in the other compact state, your Iowa nurs- ing license will be administratively placed on inactive status immediately. Only one active license can be held by a licens- ee among the compact states. The compact does not supersede federal law. There- fore if you are employed in military service or work for the federal government, you may continue to hold a nursing license in any state you choose. If you are working as a nurse in a nongovernmental capacity, you are required to contact the state board of nursing in that state to determine if a nurs- ing license is required. If you move from one compact state to another com- pact state and practice nursing, you must obtain a license in your new home state. However, you may continue to prac- tice under the former home state license and the multistate licensure privilege in the new home state for a period not t o exceed 30 da ys. a. The 30-days shall begin with the date of hire/employment in the new primary state of resi- dence. b. If the licensee begins employment before changing primary state of residence, the 30-days begins upon the date that the licensee establishes the new pri- mary state of residence. For updates on compact information or a list of compact states go to: www.ncsbn.or g/nlc .htmChange of Address/Name State law requires you to keep the Board of Nursing apprised at all times of your current mailing address. Notification of address changes must be made in writing. For your convenience, you may utilize the following form to submit your address change. Last Name: SSN: / / First Name: RN/LPN#: Middle Name: Today Yes No Previous Name: ( ) Check here if you are on active military duty. ( ) Check here if you are a Federal Employee. ( ) Check here if you are an LPN but have filed application for an RN license. ( ) Check here if your license expires in less than 2 months and you would like a renewal form mailed to you.

LPN SUPERVISION IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES In order for an LPN to supervise in an intermediate or skilled health care facility, the LPN MUST satisfactorily com- plete the board approved LPN Supervisory Course within six (6) months of employment in the supervisory role. The course is designed specifically for the supervision role in the long term care patient setting. A board approved nursing program or an approved provider of continuing education must provide the course. The area community colleges offer courses. It is the responsibility of the licensed practical nurse to maintain his or her certificate documenting completion of the course. A licensed practical nurse is entitled to supervise without the educational requirement outlined above if the licensed practical nurse was performing in a supervisory role on or before October 6, 1982. Verification is required. If licensees are unable to obtain the course within the first six months of employment, the LPN must write to the Board explaining the reason a waiver of the LPN Supervisory Course is being requested. Licensed practical nurses who are enrolled full-time in a registered nurse program are not exempt from the course. However, an LPN who is a full-time student in an RN program and who is scheduled to graduate within one year, may request a waiver by writing to the board office. The request for a waiver must state the number of credit hours to be taken each semester and include the student's expected date of graduation. Individuals who do not graduate from the RN program as scheduled or who are not successful on the RN-NCLEX\u00aemust take the next available course.Page 8 - Iowa Board of Nursing Newsletter - August, September, October 2010 - CONTINUING EDUCATION OFFERINGS - Continued on page 9August 4; 8 am - 4:30 pm; Sioux City Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support Renewal.
