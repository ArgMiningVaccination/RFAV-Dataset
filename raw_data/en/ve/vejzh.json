Customer Reviews Great podcast Such a great podcast with knowledgeable guests. I love the range of topics this podcast offers. It's great that the host and guests dive into not only into best practices for optimal health, but also acknowledge the barriers (socioeconomic, genetic, environmental etc) people may face in attaining what society tends to view as optimal health, too. It's rare to find that balance on social media or in podcasts! Taniqua Miller episode was so good! I love all of the Good Clean Nutrition podcast episodes, but some hit home in a very personal way depending where you are in life. Last week's episode felt particularly relatable, as I am a woman in that middle age category with perimenopause symptoms. Often times I womens' health symptoms are written off as being dramatic or sensitive when there's something really going on - it was captivating to hear someone putting things together. Not only did she share was happening, she shared how to counter. I think that middle-age woman just kind of feel unseen health-wise. This episode felt validating! Thank you to Dr Miller, Mary Purdy and Orgain.
