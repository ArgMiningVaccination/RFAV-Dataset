Vaccinations have been a controversial subject since their introduction, more than 200 years ago. Proponents point to reductions in the incidence of some diseases, concluding that the benefits to the human race as a whole outweigh any negative side effects experienced by any one individual. Opponents of vaccination point to statistics showing that virtually all reduction in fatalities from infectious disease occurred before widespread vaccines were introduced and that the same reductions in disease incidence also took place in countries where there were no widespread vaccination programs of any kind. The opponents point, instead, to revolutions in nutrition, sanitation and hygiene that were implemented at that time as being far more instrumental in the reduction of infectious disease than vaccinations. Opponents point to evidence that side effects of vaccination are far more serious and widespread than vaccine manufacturers will admit. They conclude that the minimal benefits of vaccination to society do not outweigh the many risks to the individual and that the greatest \"benefit\" of vaccination programs appears to be the multi-billion dollars of profit earned each year by the pharmaceutical companies as a result of mandatory vaccination programs. The body's immune system works by producing immunoglobulins (antibodies), a type of protein \"flag\", in response to the presence of foreign substances. Foreign substances that elicit the production of antibodies by the immune system are known as antigens. Microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, etc.) that elicit an antibody response are called pathogens. Once antibodies have been produced for a particular pathogen, a few specialized white blood cells, known as memory T-cells, remain circulating in the body in the event that the same pathogen is ever encountered again. The goal of vaccinations, in theory, is to try and impart the same permanent immunity by exposing the body to low levels of weakened pathogens to create an immune response, without the individual ever having to suffer through the disease caused by that pathogen. Unlike the natural immunity inherent in the body's creative mechanisms however, the conventional vaccination process bypasses all of the body's outer defences of the skin, mucous membranes and lymphatic system. By injecting pathogenic organisms directly into the bloodstream, an immediate reaction is created. Most modern vaccinations are multi-valent, consisting of multiple pathogenic organisms, which arrive in the bloodstream at full strength, with none of the levels of the immune system activated. These pathogens have the full run of the body until the immune system can respond, which can be days, weeks, or even longer, since vaccination may have taken place at such an early age that the immune organs required to mount a response have not been fully developed. Furthermore, the preservatives and other contaminants (i.e. toxic mercury) present in these formulas can cause their own health problems. There is a substantial and increasing body of statistical evidence indicating the need to provide alternative ways to modulate and support immune systems in the midst of a collapsing worldwide environment and subsequent \"medical failure to adequately address\" the problem. Vaccin-Tox assists in the homeopathic relief of vaccination imbalances designed specifically address all forms of vaccination-related conditions.
