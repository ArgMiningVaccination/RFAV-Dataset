This General Report records the deliberations and decisions of the following three Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO (Assemblies of WIPO ): (1) WIPO General Assembly, fifty -second (28th extraordinary) session (2) Paris Union Assembly, f ifty-fifth (31st extraordinary) session (3) Berne Union Assembly, forty -ninth (25th extraordinary) session, meeting on May 7 and 8, 2020, conducted in the form of a written procedure. 2. The list of the States members of the Assemblies concerned and the observers admitted to their sessions as of March 6, 2020, is set forth in document A/60/INF/1. 3. The meeting was presided over by the Chair of the WIPO General Assembly, Ambassador Omar Zniber (Mr.) (Morocco). CONDUCT OF THE MEETI NG IN THE FORM OF A WRITTE N PROCEDURE 4. The Sixtieth series of meetings of the Assemblies of WIPO was convened by the Director General of WIPO, Mr. Francis Gurry. 5. Due to the Covid- 19 pandemic, and related public health restrictions, including Host State prohibitions on public gatherings of more than five people, an in- person meeting of the Assemblies of WIPO was not possible. In this context, as noted by the Director General of WIPO, the challenges faced by the international community at this time were unprecedented. Consequently, the Director General of WIPO necessarily proposed an equally unprecedented A/60/3 page 2 written procedure that would allow the Assemblies of WIPO to take relevant decisions at their May meeting for the successful discharge of their treaty obligations as part of the process of the election of the Director General (see Note A/60/C. N 3989, dated April 14, 2020, Annex I). 6. Following the proposal by the Director General of WIPO, Member States agreed to conduct the Assemblies of WIPO , exceptionally, in the form of a written procedure (see Note A/60/C. N 3990, dated April 22, 2020, Annex I ). In agreeing to the proposal, Member States noted, as recalled in Note A/60/C. N 3989, that the written procedure was an exceptional response prompted by the global Covid- 19 pandemic, and would not be considered a precedent for the conduct of future meetings of the Assemblies of WIPO Member States in otherwise non- exceptional circumstances. 7. Similarly, and consistent with the agreement of Member States to proceed, exceptionally, with a written procedure for the conduct of the Assemblies of WIPO , the Chair of the WIPO General Assembly proposed an exceptional approach to the work of the \"Working Group on the Conditions of the Appointment of the Director General -Elect\" (Working Group) (see document WO/GA/52/1 Rev.). The Working Group was convened informally by the Chair of the WIPO General Assembly to provide recommendations on the conditions of appoi ntment of the Director General so that they may be fixed by the WIPO General Assembly (see document WO/GA/52/2 containing a summary of the deliberations of the Working Group, together with the draft contract and indicative estimate of monthly remuneration for the Director General). 8. In accordance with the written procedure, the Chair of the WIPO General Assembly circulated, on April 27, 2020, the two relevant draft decisions regarding the appointment of the next Director General of WIPO for cons ideration by Member States (see Note A/60/C. N 3991, dated April 27, 2020, Annex II). 9. As no explicit objection to the draft decisions, in the form of a negative written response, was received by the International Bureau of WIPO by the deadline set, that is, within seven calendar days or until 5 p.m. May 4, 2020, the following two decisions were therefore considered adopted: 10. \"The WIPO General Assembly and the Assemblies of the Paris and Berne Unions, each as far as it is concerned, considered the nomination of the WIPO Coordination Committee referred to in paragraph 3 of document A/60/2 and unanimously decided to appoint Mr. Daren Tang as Director General of WIPO for the period from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2026.\" 11. \"The WIPO General Assembly unanimously approved the Conditions of the Appointment of the Director General, as set forth in Annex I to document WO/GA/52/2.\" 12. With regard to the second decision on the conditions of the appointment of the Direc tor General -Elect, during the informal consultations of the Working Group, several groups observed that conducting the negotiations necessary to propose amendments to the text would be difficult under the current exceptional circumstances. Therefore, foll owing the request of one regional group, the Chair of the WIPO General Assembly will hold further informal consultations with interested Member States in advance of the fifty -fourth session of the WIPO General Assembly, with a view to updating the contract of the Director General for the term of office starting in 2026. 13. The Chair also invited WIPO Member States and observers to provide written statements that they wished to be reflected in the present report (see Note A/60/C. N 3992, dated Apri l 29, 2020, Annex III). The written statements, as received by the International Bureau, are reproduced in the following paragraphs in alphabetical order of Group, WIPO Member State, and observer. The statement of the Director General -Elect follows at paragraph 92. A/60/3 page 3 14. Finally, on May 8, 2020, the Chair of the WIPO General Assembly communicated to Member States confirmation of the decisions that were adopted, as reflected in paragraphs 10 and 11 above, and declared the meeting of the WIPO Assemblies closed (see Note C. N 3993, dated May 8, 2020, Annex IV). 15. The Delegation of Zimbabwe submitted the following statement on behalf of the African Group: \"Mr. Chair, \"The African Group w ould like to thank the Chair of the General Assembly, Ambassador Omar Zniber, the Vice- Chairs of the Assembly, Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Dr. Francis Gurry, and the Secretariat for their strenuous efforts in convening the Sixtieth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of WIPO in these challenging times. The African Group also commends the Secretariat for the preparation of documents A/60/2, WO/ GA/52/1, and WO/GA/52/2. \"Further, the Group commends of the WIPO Coordination Committee, Ambassador Fran\u00e7ois Rivasseau, the Vice Chairs, and the Secretariat for successfully convening the 27th Extraordinary Session of the C oordination Committee from 4-6 March 2020. The Group is satisfied with the transparent, credible and fair electoral process which resulted in Mr. Daren Tang, emerging as the nominee for the position of WIPO Director General. \"Chair, \"The African Group supports the appointment and conditions of service for Mr. Daren Tang, from Singapore, as reflected in documents A/60/2, paragraph 2, and WO/GA/52/1 Rev, paragraph 5, for the position of Director General of WIPO. We congratulate him on his new appointment and assure him of our support and cooperation in his new position. We note, with great satisfaction, that Mr. Tang was nominated after having received overwhelming support from the majority of Member States in the Coordination Committee. This attests to his acceptability to the generality of the WIPO Member States and the other stakeholders concerned \"The African Group would also want to give due recognition to all the other candidates who contested for the position of Director General of WIPO, including Edward Kwakwa, who was endorsed by the African Heads of State as the sole African candidate. We wis h them well in their future endeavours and urge them to continue working with WIPO for the attainment of our common objectives. \"Mr. Chair, Concerning senior appointments, it is our expectation that the Director General -Elect shall nominate a senior management team which reflects the democratic composition of WIPO Member States , in line with the principle of geographical representation. This is not to be construed as a departure from merit -based appointments, but as a simple reminder that developing countr ies, in particular, African Member States , have had insufficient representation within the WIPO senior management. \"Mr. Chair, \"The Director General -Elect will assume his new position at a time when mankind is faced with one of its most daunting challenges in the 21st century. The Covid -19 pandemic has caused the loss of life of thousands of people across the world. National borders have A/60/3 page 4 been closed, supply chains have been disrupted, thousands of jobs have been lost. In a matter of just a few months, the world economy has been seriously negatively impacted. \"Amidst all this, the health sector across the entire world has been severely strained by sick and dying people seeking a cure to one of t he most devastating epidemics of modern times. There is a serious scarcity of some pharmaceutical materials and equipment to combat this disease. The situation is particularly dire in African Countries. \"At no time in history has innovation and exceptions to intellectual property patent rights come to the fore. The African Group reiterates its call for global intellectual property solutions in the health sector and it is at this time that such calls have proven their credence. We recall our previous posi tion on the need to operationalise limitations and exceptions in the intellectual property system so as to effectively deal with the emergence of diseases such as the Zika, Ebola and the Corona viruses. The use of the compulsory license system under Artic le 31 of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) needs to be effectively fostered towards the achievement of the above aims and objectives. \"Mr. Chair, \"The mantle falls on the Director General -Elect to ensure that intellectual property is used as a catalyst to unite humanity to fight global challenges through exceptions to patent rights in health emergencies, technology transfer to capacitate developing countries to innovate and develop their own manufacturing capacity. Intellectual property should be the tool to unite the world against common challenges, something this Group has been advocating for. \"Mr. Chair, \"The Group wishes to express its gratitude to Dr. Francis Gurry, for the as tute leadership he has provided as Director General of WIPO. We commend him for his achievements in office, notably the opening of WIPO External Offices in Africa. \"Mr. Chair, \"The African Group is deeply saddened by the untimely passing of a member of s taff of the WIPO Secretariat due to the COVID -19 pandemic. We would like to join hands with WIPO in expressing our condolences to the family of the deceased. \"Finally, Mr. Chair , the Group reiterates its commitment to work with Director General -Elect Mr. Daren Tang, in the discharge of his mandate, and we stand ready to consider any proposals he may have on carrying out the future work of WIPO. \"I thank you. \" 16. The Delegation of Singapore subm itted the following statement on behalf of the Asia and Pacific Group (APG) : \"1. Singapore has the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Asia and Pacific Group (APG). At the outset, we wish to express our appreciation to Ambassador Zniber and the Vice- Chairs, for their able leadership in steeri ng the Membership forward despite the challenging circumstances brought about by the COVID -19 pandemic. Our thanks go to Director General Francis Gurry and the Secretariat as well for their hard work during this difficult time. Our thoughts are also with colleagues and their families who have been affected by the pandemic. A/60/3 page 5 \"2. First, we extend our warmest congratulations to Mr. Daren Tang on his appointment as the next Director General of WIPO . The APG is particularly proud that the Director General -Elect is the national of an APG Member, which is a first for our Group. We are certain that Mr. Tang' s appointment will further ensure better and more balanced geographical representation in WIPO. We have every confidence that Mr. Tang will build on the strong foundation and lead WIPO to greater heights. We look forward to Mr. Tang fulfilling his pledge to strengthen WIPO as an inclusive organization by bringing together developed and developing Members, large and small, as well as all stakeholders. Mr. Tang can count on the full support of the APG, as we continue to move WIPO forward together. \"3. Second, the APG wishes to place on record our deep appreciation for Director General Francis Gurry 's immense contributions to the development and success of WIPO. His vision, dedication and commitment to strengthening WIPO and the global intellectual property system has delivered concrete benefits to all WIPO Members and stakeholders. Director General Gurry has introduced many useful initiatives, such as the WIPO Advanced Technologies Applications Centre and WIPO Green, as well as focusing attention on Artificial Intelligence (AI). We are grateful for his outstanding contributions and service to WIPO. \"4. Third, the COVID -19 pandemic has not only impacted the operations of WIPO, it brought about unprecedented disruptions to Member States societies and economies. In this context, WIPO - as the facilitator of innovation that brings benefits to all - should play a crucial role in enhancing cooperation among Member States . WIPO should continue to lead the development of an effective international IP system that will foster the creation of innovative measures that are essential in overcoming this crisis, while maintaining innovation incentives for entrepreneurs. Responsible and well considered actions are also needed by all concerned in WIPO to address any emerging challenge faced by all Members in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic. \"5. In this connection, it is imperative that the Director General transition process is smooth and seamless. Regular consultations are necessary between Director General Gurry and Director General -Elect Mr. Tang on key issues, particularly those with consequences beyond September 2020. This will ensure that WIPO will be prepared and ready to move quickly once normalcy returns. \"6. The APG is confident that the WIPO leadership will continue to steer and guide the organization in a transparent and inclusive manner, striking a fine balance between fostering innovation on one hand and furthering WIPO's Development Agenda on the other. The APG has high hopes that WIPO's future activities will continue to ensure the global intellectual property regime contributes to the social, economic, and cultural development of its members. With this in mind, we look forward to significant progress in the various substantive and governance issues that have been long pending in the various Committees of the organization. \"7. The APG reiterates its congratulations and sincere good wishes to Mr. Tang on his appointment and the road ahead as Director General of the organization. \" 17. The Delegation of the Russian Federation submitted the following statement on behalf of the Group of Central Asian, Caucasus and Eastern European Countries (CACEEC) : \"On behalf of our regional Group I would like to thank the Chair of the General Assembly, the Vice-Chairs , the Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO ) Mr. Francis Gurry and, the Secretariat for their strenuous efforts to convene the Sixtieth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of WIPO , including the drafting of the necessary documents. A/60/3 page 6 \"The Group would also like to thank the Chair of the WIPO Coordination Committee and the Secretariat for the successful organization of the 27th extraordinary session of the Coordination Committee from March 4 to 5 , 2020. The Group is satisfied by the transparent nature of the electoral procedures which took place, resulting in the nomination of Mr. Daren Tang to the post of the Director General of WIPO by the Coordination Committee. \"The Group has actively contributed to the development of an unprecedented written procedure for holding the current Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO in order to appoint the new Director General. Guided by the spirit of cooperation, transparency and the need to ensure the multilateral nature of the decisions being taken, we have adopted a flexible approach and joined this special procedure in order to expedite the work of the Organization and ensure a smooth transitional period. We would like to emphasize that the written format of holding meeti ngs is being utilized under the exceptional circumstances caused by the global Covid- 19 pandemic and should not be viewed as a precedent for the future meetings of the Organization. \"Our regional Group agrees to the appointment of Mr. Daren Tang to the pos t of the Director General of WIPO and to the conditions thereof. We would like to congratulate him on the occasion of his new appointment and to assure him of our readiness to support him and actively cooperate with him on a wide range of issues. We are confident that the new Director General will be able to make a substantial contribution to the implementation of the mandate and goals of WIPO, as well as promote innovation and creativity through the development of the global system designed to protect intellectual property rights. \"The new leader of WIPO is facing a number of very important unresolved issues, the solutions to which can only be found through a trust -based relationship with States. We hope that the newly elected Director General will be able to form an effective team of senior officials bearing in mind the principle of fair geographical representation. We would like to emphasize the fact that the countries belonging to our regional Group are not adequately represented within the senior m anagement and the Secretariat of the Organization, and express our sincere hope that this issue will be properly resolved. We are confident that the States belonging to our Group possess a substantial expert potential which is rooted in the successful per formance of national intellectual property systems, and that the Organization could utilize this potential and benefit from it. \"We expect that the new Director General will continue to work on the development of the WIPO digital agenda. The measures taken as a result of the pandemic have demonstrated that the digital transformation of the Offices is practically the only viable strategy and basis for the work of the intellectual property Offices. WIPO plays a key role in harmonizing different approaches to using digital technologies. The Organization is becoming one of the main hubs for discussing the modalities of developing international solutions and standards for the use of the new digital transformation tools. It is our hope that WIPO will continue taking steps in this direction under the leadership of the new Director General, and that an active and open international dialogue, as well as an exchange of experience and best practices, will continue. \"The Group welcomes the work performed by WIPO in the area of multilingualism, which is one of the main values of the UN system. We are confident that this approach will contribute to mitigating the current disequilibrium and removing the existing language barriers to achieve a wider unimpeded access for the users and promote continued growth of the number of applications submitted through the international registration systems. Because of the geographical expansion of the systems the addition of new languages becomes inevitable; it is also dictated by the need to bring the systems closer to the users. Mr. Director General, our regional Group is ready to provide you with meaningful support in this area. A/60/3 page 7 \"Our Group would like to conclude its statement by once again congratulating the Director General on his election and reaffirming its commitment to cooperating with him in all of the key areas of WIPO work. \" 18.

China appreciates the efforts made by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in responding to the pandemic to ensure the normal operation of global intellectual property (IP) service systems. With regard to this extraordinary session, China supports the adoption of the appointment of the next Director General through a flexible approach. A/60/3 page 8 \"The term of Mr. Francis Gurry, the current Director General of WIPO, will expire on September 30.

Those achievement s are demonstrated by the following, in particular: (i) WIPO's excellent performance in fulfilling its nine strategic objectives and in maintaining a sound financial position; (ii) the conclusion of a number of international IP treaties, including the Beijing Treaty, the Marrakesh Treaty and the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement, with more countries accedin g to the various IP treaties administered by WIPO; (iii) active implementation of the Development Agenda (DA), mainstreaming of development in the work of WIPO and effective provision of substantial IP technical assistance to the Member States, to enhanc e IP capacity - building in developing countries; and (iv) more convenient and efficient IP services provided to global innovation actors through promotion of international cooperation, protection of IP and improvement of global IP service systems. \"China congratulates Mr. Daren Tang, the candidate of Singapore, on his election as the next Director General and hopes that, under his leadership, WIPO will continue to maintain a stable and healthy momentum for the balanced, inclusive and effective development of the international IP system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of the entire world. In this connection, China wishes to express the following expectations. Firstly, WIPO should continue to play an active role in global IP norm -setting to bring about positive progress in that regard. Secondly, more attention should be directed to the mainstreaming of development, with due attention to the concerns of developing countries; the DA and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development should also be actively implemented.

Fourthly, WIPO should be more open and transparent in its financial policies and budget execution, especially in the allocation and execution of budget for major projects, so as to afford Member States timely access to relevant information and to ensure their full participation. \"China will continue to participate actively in the work of WIPO and to st rengthen its cooperation with WIPO. China looks forward to working with WIPO to contribute to the global IP development efforts.\" 20. The Delegation of Germany submitted the following statement on behalf of Group B: \"1.

The Organization has achieved significant results in rec ent years and has an excellent record of sound financial stewardship. Prudent, cautious, and effective management of WIPO services will be key for continued positive performance; this applies all the more in view of the uncertainty caused by the current C OVID -19 crisis. \"6. The current crisis has also exposed and highlighted the important role WIPO plays in communicating the complexities of intellectual property and its place in sustaining innovation and creativity. The core mandate of WIPO is \"to promot e the protection of intellectual property throughout the world\". In addition to advancing this mandate through good work with Member States and stakeholders, we look forward to the WIPO 's continued constructive engagement in key international fora. \"7. The Organization also faces major new challenges and opportunities.

Our Group believes that WIPO should play an important role in this respect to the benefit of the organization' s work and coordination among Member States . \"8.

It is a real test to gauge our collective resilience and capacity to face these challenges and overcome the serious consequences caused by the crisis. We should strengthen multilateralism and reinforce international cooperation and solidarity. More than ever, this stresses the pivotal role of UN agencies, such as WIPO, in setting up the necessary mechanisms to ensure access to medical technology and innovation for public health in developing countries and LDCs, and facilitate fair and universal access to medicine at affordable costs, especially through the use of compulsory licenses. This would strike the right balance between IP rights and public interest. In this regard, we would like to emphasize the importance of fair, efficient and timely access to future vaccines against the Covid- 19 for all countries, especially the developing ones. \"The Delegation of Algeria reiterates its commitment to work constructively with the new WIPO Management for further promotion of IP rights and their enforcement.

In order to continue to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world and to convincingly demonstrate the benefits of IP protection improving everyone 's life, WIPO will not only have to address Member States and stakeholders, but reach out to the public at large and also pursue to work with all relevant international fora. \"We would like to reassure the Director General -Elect of Austria's continued support to successfully respond to actual and future challenges the Organization and the global IP community will be facing in the years to come. \"On this note, Austria would also like to take this opportunity to thank Direct or General Francis Gurry for his more than 35 years of dedicated work for WIPO and especially for his commitment and service in leading the Organization successfully for almost 12 years.

We congratulate him on his appointment and offer him the assurances of our firm support and cooperation in his new role. \"My delegation wishes to recognize the commendable leadership of the Chair of the WIPO Coordination Committee, his Bureau and the Secretariat for successfully overseeing the electoral process which in our view was conducted in a transparent, credible and fair manner.

Despite the disproportionate impact on Africa, we are encouraged by the fact that technology, innovation and intellectual property are central to the resilience and recovery strategies, including access to medical and pharmaceutical products at affordable and reasonable terms. \"In this connection, and in view of the introduction of export restrictions on medical supplies critical to addressing COVID -19, the importance of exploiting intellectual property limitations and exceptions has never been m ore important, to ensure access and local production for purposes of mitigating vulnerabilities associated with overdependence on imports. \"We look forward to working with Mr . Tang as we explore avenues and opportunities to operationalize patent flexibilities to build our capacities to effectively address these health epidemics and pandemics - now and in the future. We need to ensure domestic pharmaceutical production that contributes to the diversification and resilience of our economies in the African continent. \"Mr. Chair , It would be remiss of me to not express the sincere gratitude of the Government of Botswana to Director General, Dr. Francis Gurry, for his leadership and championing intellectual property for development. We equal ly recognise and thank him for his leadership during these unprecedented times.

Our countries are so closely linked, our citizens are now so dependent on each other that it is illusory to think we can succeed al one; unilateralism is outdated; it is on the wrong side of history. \"Multilateralism, on the contrary, offers a good response to the challenges of globalization. It embodies a certain philosophy of international relations, based not on the law of might or wealth, but on responsibility and solidarity. \"It protects our global commons. I am thinking in particular of health, trade, the environment, global warming and digital technology. \"In this context, WIPO plays a major role. \"We know how much the future of our societies depends on innovation in science, technology and the arts; we also know that innovation requires a framework that is protective, nurturing and stimulating. \"Because invention is extraordinarily difficult, demanding and fragile, inventors mus t therefore be able to count on fair recognition and fair remuneration; they must know that they will not be cheated, but rewarded; and they must also be able to share and exchange views in an arena that is no longer national, or even regional, but global. And WIPO must help to encourage them in their efforts, to give them both the openness and the security they need. \"For all these reasons, we support WIPO. \"Chair, \"France is aware that users of each of the intellectual property protection systems consi der it fundamentally important that they function and are managed properly. \"That is also why France would like WIPO to fulfil its mandate in the right conditions and to fully preserve its integrity. Thus, we remain faithful to the principles and objectives of WIPO, as set out in Article 3 of its WIPO Convention of 1967, underscoring both the unity of the organization and the solidarity, in particular budgetary solidarity, across the Unions. \"In this respect, France, like its partners, will remain particularly attentive to the preservation and development of the Lisbon Union. \"However, France notes that some technical discussions, some of which began more than 20 years ago, have still not been concluded, at the same time as new projects are about to be launched, often requiring rapid responses, such as addressing challenges related to A/60/3 page 26 new technologies. I am thinking in particular of life sciences, artificial intelligence, robotics and metadata, for example. \"Therefore, while it is necessary to allow time for negotiations and sometimes to preserve their confidentiality, it is also important to adapt to the rapid technological developments in an ever -changing world. \"Results are awaited and these cannot be so far in the future as to be unreal. \"In conclusion, you may rest assured, Chair, that my delegation will play an active and constructive part in the work of WIPO under the leadership of Mr. Daren Tang. Let me assure him of my Government 's full support in the exciting task of leading an organization that must remain true to its founding principles. \"Thank you. \" 38.

In particular, we welcome the excellent result achieved by the candidate from Singapore, which reflects a great capacity to unite and a strong sense of consensus, but also the broad support of the majority of the voting States for the vision he has espoused. \"In view of his credentials and extensive experience in the management of intellectual property, we have no doubt about his ability to administer this great organization in a spirit of balance and respect for its various components. \"In this regard, we are pleased to stress the need, also expressed by Mr. Daren Tang during his campaign, to ensure equitable geographical representation within the WIPO Secretariat, particularly for countries with little or no representation. We agree with him that the presence of all Member States within the Sec retariat is the starting- point for the erection of an international intellectual property system that can provide targeted responses in a context where disparities are legion. A/60/3 page 27 \"We would like to take this opportunity to commend Ambassador Fran\u00e7ois Rivasseau, Permanent Representative of France, Chair of the Coordination Committee, and its Vice-Chairs, for the consensual conduct of the process leading to the election of the Director General of WIPO at the 27th Extraordinary Session of the Coordination Committe e, from March 4 to 6, 2020.

When the time comes to take stock, our Governments will undoubtedly have to face multiple challenges at the economic, social, health and cultural levels, as our societal structures have been profoundly disrupted. \"This pandemic reveals the extreme interdependence of our countries and the urgent need to adopt international standards that are both fair and respectful of the great diversity, particularly sociological, of our States. In such circumstances, the mobilization of the United Nations and its specialized and related institutions and agencies is more important than ever to provide international frameworks that facilitate attaching the proper value to traditional assets, for example. \"Finally, Chair, \"My country supports the decision on the appointment of Mr. Daren Tang to the post of Director General of WIPO and the contractual conditions of service as contained in documents A/60/2 and WO/GA/52/1 Rev. \"Thank you. \" 39.

The Delegation of Germany submitted the following statement: \"The German Government would like to thank the Chair of the WIPO General Assembl y, Ambassador Zniber, for his leadership throughout these unprecedented times. We are very thankful that he conducted successfully these Assemblies given the unforeseen circumstances. We want to extend our thanks to the Chair of the Coordination Committee , Ambassador Rivasseau, the WIPO Director General, Dr . Francis Gurry, and all other colleagues who have made it possible for this important session of the WIPO Assemblies to take place in these challenging circumstances. \"The German government asks the D irector General -Elect Mr Daren Tang to accept our warmest congratulations on his election for the office of Director General by these Assemblies of the World Intellectual Property Organi zation. At the same time, we would like to wish him every success for his forthcoming term in office. As chair of the SCCR, he has already demonstrated his outstanding expertise and leadership skills in the WIPO system. \"As the global institution for intellectual property, the World Intellectual Property Organi zation is of paramount importance to Germany. Germany supports an international framework for intellectual property that strikes an adequate balance between the differing interests and concerns in this area. WIPO can rely on our unreserved support for the use of balanced and effective rules to promote global innovation, development and creativity, as well as economic, social and cultural development in all Member States . \"Artificial Intelligence will change the ways in which we think, work and interact. In this context, the IP system is a decisive driver for innovation and creativity both at the national and international levels. Germany is grateful for WIPO's engagement in this area. In our view, WIPO ca n play a key role both as an international observatory identifying and monitoring trends and developments, as well as a global forum for the exchange of ideas and the coordination of efforts . \"The German Government firmly believes that the new D irector General will succeed in continuing the reforms at WIPO embarked upon by his predecessor. We will also continue to support him in finding conciliatory and convincing solutions to the many, often heatedly debated issues surrounding intellectual property.

The Delegation of Ghana submitted the following statement: \"Thank you, Mr. Chair, \"The Delegation of the Republic of Ghana associates itself with the statement by the Delegation of the Republic of Zimbabwe on behalf of the African Group. \"Ghana wishes to congratulate Mr. Daren Tang of Singapore for his nomination and appointment as the next Direc tor General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and to pledge its support to him, recognizing the fact that he is taking up the leadership of WIPO at a very critical time in the global community. Indeed, the importance Member States continue to place on creativity and innovation was reflected in the number of well - qualified candidates that were put forward for the election for the position of Director General. We accordingly, wish to acknowledge the efforts of all other candidates and in particular, Dr. Edward Kwakwa, our distinguished national and the African Union- endorsed sole African candidate, and urge them to continue working in the interest of WIPO. \"Mr. Chair, the COVID -19 Pandemic has brought a lot of pressure on many countries and the international community as a whole. The COVID -19 crisis has demonstrated just how crucial multilateral institutions are to our collective health, prosperity, and security. Inasmuch as national governments are doing a lot on their own, there is the need for international cooperation. The challenge now is for international organizations and national governments to work together to find lasting solutions to deal with the pandemic. The role of international organizations, especially, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and WIPO are even more important at this point in time as the international community is expected to come together in a coordinated, coherent whole to respond to the wider socio- economic impacts of the crisis. The objective of WI PO, which is to promote the protection of IP through cooperation among its Member States and where necessary in collaboration with other international organizations still needs to be carried out despite the challenging times we find ourselves in. This Delegation notes with pleasure that there are still new accessions to WIPO treaties, in spite of the challenging public health circumstances. WIPO has recorded good A/60/3 page 30 results in the last few years. It is this Delegation' s hope that the pandemic will not impac t, negatively, on the gains made by the Organization. \"Mr. Chair, it will be appropriate at this point to recognize and commend Dr. Francis Gurry, the outgoing Director General of this Organization for putting WIPO on a sound footing financially and leading the Organization to achieve a record high in demand for its global IP services in 2019. We wish him all the best in his future endeavors . The Delegation of Ghana further, records in advance, with appreciation, its gratitude to D irector General Gurry, w ho will pave a seamless way for his successor D irector General Tang to take office on October 1, 2020, as shown by his exemplary commitment towards the greater good of the organization all these years. \"Mr. Chair , the appointment of the new Director Genera l marks the beginning of a new phase in the life of the Organization. Mr. Daren Tang has the mandate to build on the foundation which has been laid by all previous Directors General of this Organization. Ghana hopes that Mr. Tang will strengthen the existing cooperation and work with Member States and regional groups to ensure that interests are fairly addressed to prevent marginalization in the Organization. To carry out thi s onerous task, Mr. Tang will need to build a solid management team to assist him carry out his mandate. The Delegation of Ghana is confident that he will be up to the task. \"Mr. Chair, Ghana has traditionally regarded multilateralism as a cornerstone of its foreign policy. The Delegation of Ghana therefore reaffirms its support to WIPO and to Mr. Daren Tang to ensure he has a successful term of office. We look forward to working with Mr. Daren Tang to advance WIPO's mission of promoting the protection and use of intellectual property as a means of driving innovation, development and economic opportunity globally. \"We thank you for your attention. \" 42. The Delegation of the Holy See submitted the following statement: \"Mr. Chair , \"1. The Delegation of the Holy See expresses its sincere congratulations to you and to the Chair of the Coordination Committee for the integrity and the transparency manifested throughout the process for the election of the Director General, especially in these troubled times. Equally, we would like to take this opportunity to commend all of the frontline workers around the globe who \"offer a witness of care and love for our neighbors, to the point of exhaustion and not infrequently at the expense of their health\"1. It is also an occasion to manifest deep appreciation to Dr. Francis Gurry for his commitment to intellectual property in general, for his leadership and for the achievements during the twelve years as Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization. The historical Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities and the Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances, concluded and entered into force during his mandate, among others, bear witness to his fruitful management. \"2. The Delegation of the Holy See congratulates Mr. Daren Tang on his appointment as WIPO Director General. Given his record of accomplishment and the priorities he set out before the election, there is much expectation that this Organization will continue to be led in the right direction and stands ready to cooperate. 1 Pope Francis , Urbi et Orbi Mes s age, 12 April 2020. A/60/3 page 31 \"3. The Holy See recognizes the role of the protection system of intellectual property in promoting the literary, scientific or artistic production and, generally, the inventive activity for the sake of the 'common good' . At the same time, it emphasizes the ethical and social dimensions that uniquely involve the human person and its action. The exceptional challenge that the whole human family is currently facing demonstrates that the magnitude of the response must match the scale of the crisis and it must be multilateral, with countries showing solidarity to the most vulnerable communities and nations. \"4. The current crisis has also exposed and highlighted the need to communicate the complexities of intellectual property and to place it in the context of innovation and creativity frameworks. The Delegation of the Holy See is confident that the new WIPO COVI D-19 search facility of PATENTSCOPE will represent a critical tool in disseminating information on technologies that others may build upon for the global fight against COVID -192. Such initiatives are a practical response that will provide scientists, engineers, public health policymakers, industry actors, and members of the general public with an easily accessible source of intelligence for improving the detection, prevention, and treatment of diseases such as the novel coronavirus. \"5. In the coming years, digital transformation and artificial intelligence will present new challenges; the Organization and its services have to adapt urgently to this continually changing scenario. Artificial Intelligence is not \"neutral\". It is a result of many discipline s involved each entailing a specific area of responsibility. As recalled by Pope Francis, \"Solid reasons need to be developed to promote perseverance in the pursuit of the common good, even when no immediate advantage is apparent. There is a political dimension to the production and use of artificial intelligence, which has to do with more than the expanding of its individual and purely functional benefits (...). There is a need to create intermediate social bodies that can incorporate and express the ethical sensibilities of users and educators\"3. The Delegation of the Holy See believes that questions of ethics, human rights, and creative sector markets are central considerations, both in re- examining existing IP policy goals in a changing world, and in affirming our shared responsibility and common purpose to ensure that these emerging technologies are developed and used ethically and for the good of humanity and the environment. \"Among the various important areas of concern that this body is called to address, some new debates are of particular interest to this Delegation: - reaching an agreement on a text of an international legal instrument, which will ensure the effective protection of genetic resources, traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions, and folklore. The crucial role played by indigenous communiti es in relationship with their ancestral lands calls for a different model of development which takes into consideration the connection between the human person and the environment. During this biennium of negotiation, the Holy See considers it critical that the discussion on the legal instrument must not only favor the preferential option on behalf of the poor, the marginalized, and the excluded, but also consider their leading role. \"Others must be acknowledged and esteemed precisely as others , each with his or her feelings, choices, and ways of living and working. Otherwise, the result would be, once again, \"a plan draw n up by the few for the few\"4, if not \"a consensus on paper or a transient peace for a contented minority\". - moving forward in the negot iation on the Treaty on the Protection of Broadcast Organizations, taking into account current rapid technological developments.

Promoting the quality and the accessibility of education worldwide should be a priority for every Member State and, in this context, limitations and exceptions are a key issue to take into account. Education, which etymologically means 'to bring out' or 'to lead out', has a fundamental role in helping people to discover their talents and potential and to use them at the service of mankind: each person has something to offer to society and must be enabled to provide his or her contribution. The challenges facing our human family today are global, in a more wide-ranging sense than is often thought. Through education, it is possible not only to form minds to a broader vision capable of embracing distant realities, but even more to recognize that mankind's moral responsibility today does not just extend through space, but also through time, and those present choices have repercussions for future generations. \"In conclusion, Mr. Chair , allow me to renew the Holy See's congratulations to the Director General for his election and to express again our willingness to collaborate as usual with him and the Secretariat. \"Thank you, Mr. Chair .\" 43. The Delegation of India submitted the following statement: \"Mr. Chair, \"At the outset, India would like to align itself with the statement delivered by Singapore on behalf of the Asia and Pacific Group (APG). We also express our sincere appreciation to the Chair and the Vice- Chairs, for ably steering the proceedings of this meeting, despite the challenging circumstances brought about by the COVID -19 pandemic. We would also express our gratitude to the WIPO Secretariat for their hard work duri ng this difficult time. Our thoughts are also with colleagues and their families who have been affected by the pandemic. \"Mr. Chair, \"2. India would like to congratulate Mr .

Once again, we would like to extend our sincere wishes to Mr. Tang for his appointment and wish him the best for the road ahead in his role as D irector General of the World Intellectual Property Organization. \"Thank You. \" 44. The Delegation of Indonesia submitted the following statement : \"At the outset, we would like to convey our sincere appreciation to Chair of the WIPO General Assembly, Ambassador Omar Zniber, for his very able stewardship during this time of COVID -19 pandemic. We also highly commend Director General Francis Gurry and the Secretariat for their tireless efforts during these difficult times. Furthermore, our deepest sympathy goes to colleagues who have been affected by the pandemic . \"Indonesia associates itself with the statement by the distinguished delegate of Singapore on behalf of the Asia and Pacific Group, and wishes to convey a few remarks in its national capacity. \"First, we would like to express our hearty congratulations to Mr. Daren Tang on his appointment as the next Director General of WIPO. Indonesia certainly shares the views of Mr. Tang on how intellectual property could be used to promote socio -economic development. We welcome his commitment to change the way people think about and work with intellectual property in order to make it relevant not only to the policymakers but also 'the people of the street'. As a fellow member of the APG and ASEAN, Indonesia has every confidence in Mr. Tang' s ability to balance the interests of all stakeholders in order to forge consensus in the organization. \"Second, the COVID -19 pandemic has undoubtedly disrupted much of our way of life. However, there are indeed lessons that can be learned not only to mitigate and resolve the current crisis but relevant as well to better prepare ourselves for such similar crisis in the future. It is taken from granted that intellectual property promotes innovation. In times of crisis, however, speed is of the essence. The public's need for equitable, effective, and affordable access to the solution, whether in the form of a vaccine, treatments, or cures, should be at the forefront. International collaboration and cooperation are a must, and flexibilities should be exercised in the face of this pandemic. Balancing the interest of right-holders and the public interest has always been the main concern of policym akers but when global challenges pose an unprecedented threat to human lives, it is clear what should be the priority. \"Third, Indonesia reiterates its view on intellectual property as a powerful tool for development; for economic, social, and cultural dev elopment. However, it is clear that its effectiveness depends very much on how laws, policies, and practices are designed and effectively implemented. Thus, whether in the discussions of ongoing normative agenda or new and emerging issues, development considerations should continue to be an integral part of WIPO's work. Furthering the WIPO Development Agenda is essential in order to ensure that the global intellectual property system remain relevant and beneficial to all. \"Last, but certainly not least, we would like to convey our sincere appreciation to Director General Gurry for his dedication and hard work in the last 12 years. Under his strong and effective leadership, WIPO has successfully addressed major challenges posed by increased demand for its services, rapid technological changes, and existing A/60/3 page 34 knowledge gap between developed and developing countries. We strongly believe that Mr. Tang will continue the excellent work that Director General Gurry has achieved. It is also our hope that under Mr. Tang's leadership, WIPO will forge ahead toward a better and more balanced geographical representation in the Organization. \"We look forward to continuing our great cooperation with WIPO. Rest assured that Indonesia remains committed to support and promote the global intellectual property system in order to encourage creativity and innovation as well as fulfil the development needs of WIPO members. \"Thank you. \" 45.

Given the emerging challenges, the new Director General has before him an enormous task to promote the role of WIPO to respond effectively to the legitimate concerns of all Member States . \"6. Technological advances may have their own setbacks in terms of increasing inequalities. It is one of the WIPO 's responsibilities to mitigate, through its development programs, the disadvantageous effects of rapid technological changes on the capacity of developing and least developed countries. In this regard, there is a need for an effective collaboration, and a mutually responsive relationship between Member States and the Secretariat to enable the Organization to keep pace with technological and economic changes. The role of the Director General for creating networked coor dination to make the Organization more effective and more accessible to play its bridging role is essential. A/60/3 page 35 \"7. The Islamic Republic of Iran continues to attach high significance to WIPO as an embodiment of multilateralism and collective norm -setting. We should make every effort to shield WIPO against unilate ralist agendas. To address the challenges caused by unilateralism, all st akeholders need to stick to rule of law, respect international law and be committed to multilateralism. \"8. The Islamic Republic of Iran is determined to continue its constructive role in fulfilling WIPO 's global mandate and advancing the agendas of its Governing Bodies and Committees through cooperation with Member States and the Secretariat.

The Delegation of Japan submitted the following statement: \"First of all, Japan would like to express its appreciation to Director General Francis Gurry for his leadership in fulfilling WIPO's missions, including, most recently, dealing with the difficulties caused by COVID -19 pandemic in cooperation with IP offices.

A/60/3 page 61 We are confident that Mr. Daren will lead the WIPO team to go beyond that and move its business towards more growth and efficiency. \"Also, we are pleased to express our sincere thanks and gratitude to the WIPO Director General Mr. Francis G urry for the efforts he made during his two periods in the office, during which a new growth in the WIPO businesses and a higher level of financial sustainability was recorded. \"Mr. Chair , \"The world is going through thes e days an exceptional circumstance, because of the outbreak of the new Coronavirus (Covid -19) and its transformation into a global pandemic, as announced by the World Health Organization, for which the world has lost a lot of lives, in addition to many health, economic and social implications and challenges, and disruption of the movement of goods and the supply chains around the world, including devices, equipment, and materials necessary to maintain human health. \"Mr. Chair , \"In light of this global pandemic, and the resulting repercussions covering various aspects of life, the GCC Patent Office has taken several important decisions and measures aimed at alleviating the expected effects on patent applicants and agents around the world, and to help them mai ntain their rights in their patent applications and granted patents, one of which is extending the time limits stipulated by the law. \"Mr. Chair , \"Intellectual property system and its international agreements play a pivotal role in stimulating research, development and innovation centers and institutes of both the public and private sectors worldwide to reach a treatment and vaccine for this epidemic, and the development of medical material and devices that contribute to reducing the outbreak of the virus and to minimizing its implications, in addition to regulating the exploitation of the associated IP rights in the cases of emergency and general pandemics. \"In the end, we look forward to further expansion and growth in the important role of WIPO in establi shing a balanced and effective international IP system that stimulates innovation and creativity, and takes into account the various levels of development around the globe, with our wishes for health and safety for all. \" 81. The Wor ld Trade Organization (WTO) submitted the following statement : \"As the Assemblies take a milestone decision on the WIPO's future leadership, the WTO would like to express its appreciation of the close and valued collaboration that has marked the relationship between the two organizations in the field of IP for a quarter century. \"This year marks both the 50th anniversary of the entry into force of the Convention Establishing WIPO and the 25th anniversary of the entry into force of the TRIPS Agreement, which incorporated signific ant parts of WIPO -administered conventions. The multiple connecting points between the two organizations that resulted from this deeply integrated legal system provide the backdrop to the ambition of our Members to \"establish a mutually supportive relationship\" between the WTO and WIPO enshrined in the Preamble of the TRIPS Agreement. That ambition is further concretized in the formal co-operation agreement between the two organizations which will see its 25th anniversary on 22 December this year . A/60/3 page 62 \"The collaboration between our organizations envisaged by our founding Members has resulted in fruitful cooperation across a wide range of activities. Coordination and collaboration in the delivery of technical assistance and capacity building have been particul arly valuable, exemplified by the annual joint flagship activities, the Advanced Course for Government Officials and the Colloquium for Teachers and Researchers. WIPO and WTO have worked together to assist developing and least -developed Members to find ta ilored solutions when implementing the flexible TRIPS standards in their domestic IP systems. WIPO's reporting over the years on technical assistance to the TRIPS Council now amounts to an impressive record contribution to Factual information on the negot iation history of WIPO conventions is regularly sought from WIPO by WTO panels when their provisions are pertinent in WTO disputes. A shared engagement in the trilateral co -operation in the area of public health has helped create a stronger, empirically based platform to support Members' policy capacity and strengthen technical assistance in this vital area. And valuable practical co- operation has continued on implementing the transparency of legislative texts. \"We would like to express our warm appreciation to Director General Gurry for his leadership during years that have seen co- operation between our agencies expand in scope and deepen in richness of quality. We have been working together in a spirit of collegiality and partnership, within the mandates set for the two organizations by our respective memberships. Looking towards the future, we recognize the challenges and opportunities presented by the continuing need to ensure that the IP system remains an effective policy tool that is adaptable to the evolving priorities and circumstances of all nations. The multilateral system should respond effectively to global issues such as public health and the environment, and new developments such as electronic commerce and artificial intelligence. At a time when the critical need for international co- operation is so directly manifest, we look forward to continuously further strengthening our relationship in the years to come under the new leadership of Mr . Tang that the WIPO Assemblies is set to confirm in its historic decision today. \" 82. The Consortium for Common Food Names (CCFN) submitted the following statement: \"Mr. Chair, \"The Consortium for Common Food Names (CCFN) would like to thank you for this opportunity to provide a statement to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) General Assembly for the record of its May meeting in Geneva. CCFN is an independent, international non- profit alliance whose membership includes companies and organizations from many developed and developing countries. Our mission is to preserve the legitimate right of producers and consumers worldwide to use common names, to protect the value of internationally recognized brands and to prevent new barriers to commerce. \"We congratulate Mr. Daren Tang on hi s election to serve as the next Director General of WIPO. We are confident that he will provide valuable leadership during this critical period for WIPO and the global economy. We also sincerely thank Mr. Gurry for his years of service to WIPO as the Dir ector General. \"CCFN looks forward to working with Mr. Tang and his team to ensure that WIPO members and interested parties are provided balanced information on issues related to common names in order to allow them to make informed decisions in the best interests of their producers, consumers, trading partners and other stakeholders. \"To achieve these goals, we are committed to ensuring that common names are treated in an equitable manner that affords them equal stature to Geographical Indicators (GIs) in WIPO's policies, programs and initiatives, as this is essential to the sustained integrity of the whole Intellectual Property (IP) system that WIPO is tasked with promoting and A/60/3 page 63 defending. Looking ahead, we are optimistic that issues related to preserving t he use of common food names will be given the level of attention needed in order to fully inform and educate WIPO members and others about the importance of these issues within the global context of properly balancing and crafting IP policies. \"We are comm itted to working with WIPO to advance both institutional and programmatic solutions to ensure that those looking to WIPO for objective guidance and assistance on GIs and related intellectual property issues are also fully aware of the importance of safeguarding the use of common food names and how to best accomplish that. \"It is very important to recognize that the impact of imbalanced approaches to GI policies in markets around the world puts at risk due process rights, transparency and public consultation procedures, and can create barriers to widely produced products. Companies relying on common food names are operating in good faith, using terms that have been in the public domain for many decades, yet face unprecedented efforts to ban the use of the wi dely recognized terms they rely on. Balancing the interests of common name users with those of GI holders is a fundamental component of ensuring that IP systems take into account the interests of all relevant stakeholders. \"We pledge to work collaboratively with Mr. Tang and his team in the future development of WIPO's and WIPO members' programs as they related to GIs and common names.\" 83. The Electronic Information for Libraries (EIFL) submitted the following statement: \"Electronic Information for Librar ies (EIFL), that works with libraries to enable access to knowledge in developing and transition economy countries, congratulates Mr . Daren Tang on his appointment as Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization. \"As the first Director General to be newly appointed from outside the O rganization, you bring to the role valuable knowledge of the practical workings of IP law and policy, and its impact on modern business, science and society. In the field of copyright, that most closely affe cts the work of libraries, the experience of Singapore, a young, newly industrialized nation that has recently undertaken its biggest copyright law reform in 30 years, is especially relevant. Libraries welcomed the review's technology -friendly approach to the law, the desire to better support creators and enjoyment of creative works in the digital age, and the transparent consultation process. \"Under your leadership, we hope that you can ensure that such principles also apply at WIPO, especially around wor k on copyright limitations and exceptions. In particular, we hope that you can encourage analysis and evidence- based policy -making to promote understanding and help inform policy debates and norm -setting activities at WIPO. For example, by utilizing the Office of the Chief Economist to assess the economic effects of IP policy choices. provide a fresh focus on the importance of a balanced IP system in supporting economic, social and cultural development, and in WIPO's role supporting attainment of all the SDGs. ensure that WIPO's technical and legislative assistance is development - oriented and appropriate to national priorities and levels of socio-economic development.

Libraries around the globe have had to urgently shift operations onl ine to support education, research and communities, bringing to the fore the challenges of compliance with copyright laws many of which are out-of-date and not fit for purpose in the digital age. \"We hope that under your leadership, WIPO will be able to respond positively to these global challenges, such as COVID -19 and climate change, so that WIPO can demonstrate its true global potential. \"We look forward to working with you. \"Thank you.\" 84. The Inter -American Association of Intellectual Property (ASIPI) submitted the following statement: \"On behalf of the Inter -American Association of Intellectual Property (ASIPI), we would first like to express our sincere congratulations to the current Director General, Mr. Francis Gurry, for his excellent work at the helm of WIPO. We also congratulate Mr. Daren Tang on his appointment to the post of Director General of WIPO and wish him every success in his endeavors. \"ASIPI is a non -profit organization founded 56 years ago. Its main purposes are to promote and protect the collective interests of its active associates through the study and dissemination of intellectual property; to encourage normative development and the defense of intellectual property in American countries; and to improve the knowledge and pr ofessional practice of its associates. \"Throughout its history, ASIPI has forged numerous and fruitful collaborative partnerships with entities that share its vision. These partnerships have included very close cooperation with WIPO for several years. \"Projects undertaken in collaboration with WIPO include the following. Activities with the Patent Law Division ASIPI supported WIPO in the patent drafting course, which was held during the ASIPI seminar in March 2020 in Uruguay. \"We are working to ensure that this workshop is recognized by Latin American Offices, with a view to organizing an introductory course on patent drafting. Roving Workshops on PCT and ePCT We have been supporting WIPO in these PCT workshops. \"We have been involved in several other event s to promote intellectual property in the region and in different Latin American countries. \"In the light of the current global situation, we consider it important for WIPO to support and assists countries in the region with the automation of their platfor ms and training of their officials. A/60/3 page 65 \"ASIPI joins WIPO and the local and global intellectual property communities to work responsibly towards a better world. For this reason, ASIPI supports the WIPO Green Acceleration Project, which promotes the innovation and dissemination of green technology. Through its ASIPIVerde program, ASIPI also seeks to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in Latin America in areas focused on environmental conservation, climate change mitigation and social welfare. \"We great ly appreciate the work of WIPO and are pleased that, after several years and countless joint initiatives, we maintain the same momentum and desire for successful collaboration, always in support of the IP system. \" 85. The International Authors Forum (IAF) submitted the following statement: \"The International Authors Forum (IAF) wishes to thank the Chair of the WIPO General Assembl y, the Chair of the SCCR, the Director General of WIPO, the Deputy Director General of WIPO for the Copyright and Creative Indust ries Sector, and the staff of the Secretariat of WIPO for the excellent work done over the past year. We would also like to offer our congratulations to Mr. Daren Tang on his nomination as the Director General of WIPO. \"IAF represents authors from the tex t, screenwriting and visual arts sectors and their interests in copyright. Its members are over 70 organi zations representing well over 700,000 authors worldwide. \"We hope all involved in the Assemblies and beyond keep safe, and acknowledge the positive w ork of WIPO in the current crisis. We hope to contribute to efforts in supporting the many people affected by this crisis. \"Regarding exceptions and limitations, we would like to acknowledge the efforts of the secretariat over the last year in establishing additional seminars to encourage discussion on this issue. Ultimately it is authors' work that is being discussed at WIPO. For authors to contribute to the culture around them a balanced approach to exceptions is necessary. Authors cannot work and create when they are not adequately paid, even the best-intentioned exceptions to copyright must not disadvantage the human right of authors to seek a living from their work. \"Considering any significant changes to limitations and exceptions, care should be taken to honor international copyright provisions that enable and encourage licensing and fair remuneration. Authors are proud their work contributes to library and archive collections which are essential in ensuring the preservation and availability of knowledge, culture and heritage. Authors want the widest possible lawful access to their work and recogni ze the institutions vital to encouraging access for all. While achieving access, a balance must be struck to allow authors proper remuneration for their work. \"IAF favors adding the artists' resale right to the SCCR agenda. Resale Right can give a fair contribution from the global art market to the community of the creator. It is important that artists in all countries can benefit from the resale of thei r creations; this is a matter of equity with how creators of other works are respected and rewarded for the continued enjoyment of their creation. \"We welcome the proposal expressed at the SCCR 39th session to look further into the benefits of public lendi ng right (PLR). PLR is a positive mechanism that provides recognition for authors for the loans of their books from libraries. PLR is greatly valuable to authors both as a connection to ongoing readers, encouraging literacy as well as the seed of the aut hors' next creation. It rewards authors for contributions made to a vital public good, the availability of culture in public libraries. IAF supports the development of centrally funded PLR schemes that are to the benefit of, readers and libraries.\" A/60/3 page 66 86. The International Council of Museums (ICOM) submitted the following statement: \"The International Council of Museums (ICOM), an international organi zation representing museums and museums professionals in over 138 countries, would like to express its sincere thanks to the current Director General, Mr. Francis Gurry, for his leadership of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) from October 2008 to September 2020. Along his many achievements, his guidance led to the adoption of the Marrakes h Treaty in 2013, which promotes the inclusion of and access to education for the visually impaired by including limitations and exceptions to traditional copyright laws. We would also like to thank him for his cooperation with ICOM and the museum communi ty by including museums in discussions on copyright limitations and exceptions and establishing the ICOM -WIPO Art and Cultural Heritage Mediation service. \"We would also like to extend our best wishes to Mr. Daren Tang, who has been nominated for the post of Director General of the WIPO, and with whom we had the opportunity to collaborate and discuss cultural heritage preservation issues during his tenure as Chair of the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights (SCCR). The Committee's analytical work highlighted the extent to which museums have not been supported by their national copyright laws to make, inter alia , preservation copies of cultural heritage, without which our history and identity is at risk of disappearing. Inconsistent, non- existe nt or inadequate copyright laws hamper the public service mission of cultural heritage institutions to safeguard our heritage. With the ever-increasing threat of climate change, the need to address this situation is becoming even more urgent. \"At a time w hen we face extraordinary challenges, we hope that the WIPO can act as a force for change by moving discussions on copyright limitations and exceptions towards international action in favor of preservation copies and legal certainty for cultural heritage institutions. \"We trust that WIPO will continue to promote a balanced approach to the copyright system, as well as strong measures, both at national and international level, always ensuring the full participation of civil society representatives in the dis cussions. \"We look forward to continuing to engage and participate in the development of a global intellectual property ecosystem that supports our cultural institutions to work for the benefit of all by safeguarding the history, life and identity not only of countries and peoples, but of humanity as a whole. \" 87. The International Federation of Intellectual Property Attorneys (FICPI) submitted the following statement: \"Founded over 100 years ago, FICPI is the international representative association for IP attorneys in private practice throughout the world, with about 5,500 members in 86 countries and regions, including Europe, China, Japan, South Korea and USA. \"FICPI aims to study all administrative or legislative reforms and all improvements to internati onal treaties and conventions, with the object of facilitating the exercise by inventors and IP owners of their rights, of increasing their security, and of simplifying procedure or formalities. \"In pursuance of this aim, FICPI strives to offer well balanc ed opinions on proposed international, regional and national legislation based on its member' experience with a great diversity of clients having a wide range of different levels of knowledge, experience and business needs of the IP system. A/60/3 page 67 \"FICPI appreciates the opportunity to file a written statement to the Sixtieth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO. \"Congratulations . \"FICPI expresses our congratulations to Mr. Daren Tang on his nomination as the candidate for appointment to the post of Director General of WIPO by the WIPO Coordination Committee, and look forward to continuing our relationship with WIPO under his leadership. \"Key issues \"We have highlighted below some of the key issues facing the global IP community, apart from those arising from the current pandemic. \"IP Services \"FICPI members and their clients are key users of WIPO's IP services, and we anticipate our continued involvement in the Working Groups relating to these systems. \"Confidentiality of communications between clients and their IP advisors. \"The topic of confidentiality of communications between clients and their IP advisors (sometimes referred to as client -attorney privilege) has been on the agenda of the Standing Committee on the Law of Patents (SCP) for a long time. FICP I appreciates the sharing session that took place at SCP31 and believes such an important aspect of the IP system should continue to be discussed on a multilateral level. \"Design Law Treaty \"A draft text of the proposed Design Law Treaty has been ready for progression from the Standing Committee on the Law of Trademarks, Designs and Geographical Indications (SCT) to a Diplomatic Conference for many years, but progress has continually stalled. Such a treaty would offer significant benefits to both users and Offices by harmoni zing the formal aspects for design registration, and therefore FICPI expresses our continued support for this important project. \"Coronavir us SARS- CoV-2 (Covid -19) Crisis \"Users of IP Systems in Member States and regions have been adversely affected by the Covid -19 crisis. It would be helpful if the International Bureau encouraged Member States and Regional Representatives to consult with users and devise measures to ensure intellectual property rights are pr eserved to the extent possible, including providing relief, to the greatest extent possible, when deadlines cannot be met owing to circumstances created by the pandemic. \" 88. The International Federation of Library Association (IFLA) submitted the following statement: \"Dear Director General, Your Excellencies, \"The International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) and Institutions represents the interests of libraries of all types and their users globally, with members in 153 countries worldwide. \"We would like to thank the current Director General, Dr. Gurry for his excellent work, in particular regarding the success of the Marrakesh Treaty. This Treaty, WIPO's fastest A/60/3 page 68 moving in terms of new accessions and ratifications, reflects the importance and the urgent need for exceptions to copyright as a vital element of balance in the copyright system. It has underlined the potential of WIPO to find solutions to failures in the IP system, and to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. \"We wish you the best for the future and hope to have the opportunity to continue our collaboration. \"IFLA would also like to congratulate Mr. Daren Tang on his nomination as Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization. You take on this role at an important time, with the limits of current copyright law in many countries becoming increasingly clear in a digital environment. In too many WIPO Member States , public interest activities are complicated or made impossible by outdated laws - or their absence - despite the fact that they would do no harm to markets. \"The situation we face today with the COVID -19 pandemic has only underlined the need for such laws in order to ensure that the essential functions of libraries can contin ue on the basis of legal certainty, and not jus t the goodwill of rightholders. Even when the pandemic is over, the need for the sort of long- term solutions that action at WIPO alone can provide remains. In particular, as we highlighted on World IP Day, this absence of international legal provisions stands in the way of efforts to preserve our heritage faced with the threat of climate change. More than 350 organi zations, institutions and professionals in over 90 countries called for action to address this. We trust that WIPO will hea r these calls. \"You bring valuable experience to the role. We note your strong track record in Singapore, and in particular the planned copyright reforms which provide an excellent example of the use of solid legal and economi c evidence, and which have led to a result which balances interests users and rights holders. We have also appreciated your contributions during your term as Chair of the SCCR, including the clear indication of the need to find digital -ready, cross -border solutions for cultural heritage, education and other uses during your introductory speech to the regional workshop held in Singapore in April 2019. \"In becoming Director General, we hope that you will be able to refresh and redouble efforts to realize the potential of WIPO as a catalyst and guide for evidence- based change, benefitting libraries and their billions of users worldwide. \"We look forward to continuing to work with you.\" 89. The International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisation (IF RRO) submitted the following statement: \"IFRRO wishes to thank the Chair of the WIPO General Assembly, the Chair of the SCCR, the Director General of WIPO, the Deputy Director General of WIPO for the Copyright and Creative Industries Sector, and the staff of the Secretariat of WIPO for the excellent work done over the past year. We also offer our congratulations to Mr. Daren Tang on his nomination for the post of Director General of WIPO. \"The International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations, IFRR O, is the network for the Collective Management Organisations and author and publisher organisations in the text and image sector, with 155 member organisations in more than 80 countries worldwide. A/60/3 page 69 \"On capacity building, we welcome WIPO's engagement with stakeholders, including IFRRO, in public private partnerships that enhance access to works and support the effective implementation of copyright. Since the last General Assembly, new joint WIPO/IFRRO projects have been launched in Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America, and the initial results of those projects are very promising. The work done by the Accessible Books Consortium remains of high importance, and IFRRO is proud to be a member of its advisory Board. \"On exceptions and limitations , we congratulate the WIPO Member States and the WIPO Secretariat for the impressive work done over the last year. IFRRO attended the International Conference on Copyright Limitations and Exceptions for Libraries, Archives, Museums and Educational & Research Institutions in Geneva in November 2019, and we also participated in all three regional seminars in Singapore, Nairobi, and Santo Domingo. We appreciated the quality of the discussions, the amount of information shared, and the common understanding that emerged from the debates at those seminars. \"The issue of exceptions and limitations was thoroughly discussed, and their importance as a part of the copyright framework, alongside that of effective collective management was acknowledged. \"IFRRO's view is that the international copyright framework has sufficient flexibility to support access to content and ensure the well-functioning of schools, univers ities, libraries and other institutions. The issue rather is in the lack of capacity and infrastructure and the non-implementation of already existing international instruments into national legal systems. \"Finally, IFRRO continues to favor adding the resale right to the SCCR agenda, and welcomes the proposal expressed at the SCCR 39th session to look further into the benefits of public lending right.\" 90. The Japan Patent Attorneys Association (JPAA) submitted the following statement: \"JPAA, Japan Patent Attorneys Association having over 11,000 qualified Patent Attorneys in Japan, would like to sincerely congratulate an appointment of Mr. Daren Tang as a new Director General of WIPO. Although COVID -19 pandemic situation unfortunately bars us from directl y extending our warmest congratulations in an in- person meeting, we would like to express our appreciation for inviting JPAA for our congratulatory address for the new Director General of WIPO, Mr. Tang. \"Recognizing Mr. Tang's valuable efforts and achievements within Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) in Singapore and beyond Singapore, in ASEAN regions, which has successfully transformed the IPOS from a conventional registry and regulatory agency into an innovative agency, JPAA strongly believes that WIPO will have, and also has to have, a key role in a new era of global IP system for igniting and advancing new innovation such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in more sustainable and meaningful manner for all stakeholders all over the world, under the strong leadership of the new Director General. \"JPAA has been proactively involved and participating in WIPO's activities and meetings since last century.

The Knowledge Ecology International (KEI) submitted the following statement: \"Knowledge Ecology International (KEI) congratulates Mr. Daren Tang on his appointment as Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). \"Mr. Tang will head the UN agency that is responsible for shaping intellectual property norms and practices in ways that serve the public, including marginalized communities. In recent years, WIPO has moved some of its negotiations into off -the-record informals, making it more difficult for the public to know what their national delegations favor in this UN forum, and we are troubled by this drift toward less transparency and less accountability for national negot iators. \"WIPO has failed to introduce economic analysis into its core activities. For example, there is no analysis of the economic impact of the proposal for a new broadcasting treaty, on the distribution of income between artists, performers and the public, on the one hand, and owners of broadcasting organizations on the other, as well as on the waste associated with orphaned works, and additional transaction costs to consolidate rights and reduced access to creative works. \"The Director General should m odernize policy analysis at WIPO, engage with civil society, and resist the relentless pressure from rent -seeking rightholder lobbies to turn WIPO back into a captured institution. \"WIPO needs to provide useful and timely advice to countries struggling to address intellectual property barriers in the development, expanded manufacturing and access to new services and products to prevent and treat COVID -19 related illnesses. The new COVID 19 IP tracker is a start, but more can be done. The Director General should address this issue, in the context of the need to scale manufacturing capacity and provide affordable access to all of relevant technologies.\" 92. The Director General -Elect Mr. Daren Tang submitted the following acceptance speech: \"Your Excellency Ambassador Omar Zniber, Chair of the WIPO General Assembly, Dr. Francis Gurry, Director General, WIPO, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates . \"I am humbled and honored by the trust and support that the members of the General Assembly have given me in appointing me as Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization. \"At the outset, I wish to express my deep gratitude to the Chairperson of our Assembly, Ambassador Omar Zniber. Thank you, Ambassador, for your calm, wise and impar tial leadership in guiding all members and directing the proceedings of our Assembly under these unprecedented and extraordinary circumstances. \"I would also like to express my deep appreciation to the Chairperson of the Coordination Committee, Ambassador Fran\u00e7ois Rivasseau. Thank you for your unfailing patience and skillful diplomacy in guiding us through the many months leading up to my nomination as Director General by the Committee, and for always ensuring that respect for due process was upheld. A/60/3 page 71 \"Abo ve all, I wish to express my most sincere thanks to all Member States for your support and confidence in entrusting me with this immense responsibility. I promise to discharge it to the utmost of my ability, with humility and sincerity, and to always be guided by the interests and needs of all the Member States . Our common aspirations and goals can only be achieved through support from and mutual co- operation with all of you, and my work and that of the Secretariat will be conducted on the principles of i ntegrity, transparency and accountability. \"My profound gratitude also goes to the Singapore government, whose support for me as its nominee was critical to the successful outcome of the campaign. I am proud to be a son of Singapore, and my hope is to bri ng the values of professionalism, integrity, inclusiveness and multilateralism, all of which are very much part of the Singapore ethos, in the serv ice of the global IP community. \"Mr. Chair, at this juncture I also wish to pay the highest tribute to the WI PO staff and leadership, and in particular to the outgoing Director General, Dr. Francis Gurry. Dr. Gurry first joined WIPO in 1985. He has served this O rganization untiringly for 35 years in various capacities, and as its Director General for the last 12 years. His acuity of mind, his intellect and vision, his leadership, as well as his magisterial command of IP are known to us all. Without exception, we all owe you an immense debt of gratitude, Dr. Gurry. For me, it was personally a privilege to have worked with you, and to now have the opportunity to build on your sterling accomplishments and those of your predecessors. I thank you warmly for a lifetime of committed service to WIPO and wish you the very best in your many future endeavors. \"Distinguished Delegates, \"This year marks 50 years since the WIPO Convention came into force, and we find ourselves meeting under extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances on this occasion. Many of us are wondering when life can go back to normal and what the new normal would look like. In these uncertain times, we need to return to fundamentals. We have to ask ourselves what is truly important, to be our ballast in this storm and serve as our compass as we emerge from it. \"I believe that there are two fundam entals underpinning the work of WIPO. First, as human beings we have an innate drive to innovate and create. Indeed, it is one of the defining characteristics of the human race and will continue to be so. Second, as a UN agency, our mission is to help channel this drive to better the lives of our people, our communities, our countries and our world. This is why the WIPO Convention continues to be relevant even 50 years later, in its exhortation to all of us that \"in order to encourage creative activity we should promote the protection of IP throughout the world. \"To achieve this mission, we have to overcome not just the urgent and extraordinary challenge that confronts all of us at present, but also the deeper forces of unilateralism and parochialism that threaten to undermine the very basic tenets of our institution. Our response to all these challenges must be to work even more closely together, not just because of the international character of our agency, but because the most important challenges we face simply cannot be tackled or solved w ithout a common, global effort. \"Distinguished Delegates, \"Turning to the work ahead, I first want to thank the many members and individuals who have taken the time to share their views with me about how we can advance the mission of WIPO and take it to the next stage. Your views have been invaluable in allowing me to outline what lies ahead of us. Our conversation and engagement on the work and future A/60/3 page 72 of WIPO must be continuous, so that WIPO can be fully energized by a common vision across all its members, s takeholders and the WIPO staff. \"It is my conviction that while the fundamentals of WIPO remain unchanged, the demands and expectations placed on us by our peoples and the world require us to go beyond continuing to do what we do well. We must also explore innovative ways of doing what we now do, as well as trying some things which are entirely new but will bring meaningful and positive impact to our communities. Our work can be channeled along three themes. \"First, we must prioritize work towards building an inclusive global IP ecosystem that serves the interests of all countries and their stakeholders. Special attention must be paid to those that need more help, especially the developing countries and the least developed amongst them. Such support must be done in a manner that respects and understands the relevant political, economic and cultural context in which it is being rendered. \"After 50 years, there are still many Member States who continue to feel that it is not clear how IP has brought concrete benefits to their communities or their economies. This must be addressed. Inclusiveness therefore also means that our support is rendered not just to IP offices, but also work with them to support the stakeholders within a country - the artists, the creators, the start -ups and SMEs, and others - to have access to the right training and receive the support they need. Success must be measured not just by activity but by impact. Ultimately, we need the people of each country to see a direct connection between IP as a legal right and their lives as innovators, creators, business owners, workers and consumers. \"Second, we must work towards a balanced global IP ecosystem, ensuring that the institutions, companies, policy makers, users and all stakeholders in our global innovation community can participate in, and benefit from, this global IP ecosystem. \"WIPO's IP registries will remain a cornerstone of our work - through it, we provide a platform for the inventions of our people and enterprises to reach out to the world. Indeed, this aspect of our work makes WIPO unique - no other UN agency interacts with inventors and innovative enterprises from around the world on a daily basis as we do, through the hundreds of thousands of IP filings that flow through our registration systems each year. These systems are core and critical to WIPO's mission success and must be constantly improved to deliver optimal services for all users. \"As for the valuable data that is generat ed by these systems or which is otherwise held by WIPO, we must use technology and analytics to transform them into insights that can be shared with Member States and the international community, to allow us to make even better operational and policy choic es, whether nationally or globally. \"Our work on the normative agenda must be re- energized. Let us come together and find the political will to commit to overcoming the current impasse. In some areas, we are not far from reaching consensus. To give this area a push, I will undertake intensive consultations in the coming months. As we embark on this new decade, we owe it to our peoples to bring this work to fruition, to regain momentum in a core area of our work, and to ensure that we continue to remain relevant. \"Third, WIPO must work towards a vibrant and forward- looking global IP ecosystem. \"It must help the world broaden its perspective of IP beyond its legal and technical aspects to its powerful role as a supporter of entrepreneurs and enterprises, catalyst for investments, driver of economic growth and a promoter of social vibrancy. A/60/3 page 73 It must support our innovators in our start -ups and SMEs, and our artists in the various creative fields, both of whom represent the future of our world, to connect more closely to our markets and communities. \"WIPO should also leverage on its role as a gl obal, neutral and professional platform for IP offices to come together to discuss common challenges, share best practices, incubate projects and bring the global community of IP offices even closer together. It should engage and work closely with other U N agencies, international organizations and NGOs to find solutions to global challenges such as sustainable development, climate change, public health and access to information and knowledge, especially since such challenges increasingly touch on aspects of IP. \"Even as we look to the advancement of our mission, it is important that we build the strongest organizational foundations for our work. As the Chief Executive of WIPO, a key part of my duties will be to work closely with WIPO colleagues to lead and manage the organization well, so as to execute our mission professionally and effectively. \"First, as an agency that supports innovators and creators around the world, WIPO itself must be a dynamic, open, and transparent Organization, with a diverse staff membership that better reflects a fair gender and geographical balance. We will strive to recruit the best amongst the well -qualified as staff members, and to build a culture where there is mutual respect, free from fear or favor , and focused on action and impact. But it will not be enough to recruit the best people into WIPO. To retain and grow them, we must also invest in training our people, which in turn will make us a more effective Organization, whose staff who are not just passionate about making a difference but are effective at doing so. \"Second, WIPO needs to continue emphasizing high standards of governance, across the breadth and hierarchy of the agency. This will help it to continue earning the trust, goodwill and credibility of members and other stakeholders, and enable it to successful ly carry out its work. \"Third, WIPO needs to continue being financially healthy. At present, we are in a position of financial strength. This is a testament to the skill and efforts of the WIPO leadership as well as result of the increased interest in innovation globally. However, the current situation has amply demonstrated that this must never be taken for granted and we must continue to be prudent in the way we manage our assets and resourceful in the way we execute our work. With this approach, we will have sufficient resources to sustain our agency and continue strongly suppor ting each and every one of you. \"Distinguished Delegates, \"Even if the world around us right now is in a state of flux, the fundamental tenets of WIPO remain unchanged. WIPO is still the custodian of the global IP ecosystem, ensuring its robust health and advancing its future development. Since the creation of the Paris and Berne Conventions in the late 19th century, to the entry into force of the WIPO Convention 50 years ago, the world has suffered the ravages of history and profoundly transformed time and again. Yet each time we and our predecessor institutions did not merely survive but emerged from it stronger and more relevant. This is because of the wisdom, courage and leadership of those who came before us, who brought the WIPO Member States together each time we faced moments of upheaval, to set aside our differences and work collectively for the common good. A/60/3 page 74 \"It is thi s proven willingness to share joint responsibility, confront challenges and transform together that have allowed WIPO to continue to be relevant and vital to the world. As your new Director General, I ask you, in the midst of these extraordinary times, to join me in living up to this spirit, to overcome the challenges we face and together to renew, reinforce and re- energize WIPO as it sets on a new path. \"I thank you all.\" [Annex es follow] WIPO WORu) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANIZATION C. N 3989 The Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) presents his compliments to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and has the honor to refer to the Sixtieth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO, namely, the three Assemblies of WIPO and of the Unions administered by WIPO that will meet in extraordinary sessions on May 7 and 8, 2020: (1)WIPO General Assembly, fifty-second (28th extraordinary) session; (2) Paris Union Assembly, fifty-fifth (31st extraordinary) session; and (3) Berne Union Assembly, forty-ninth (25th extraordinary) session. The Covid-19 pandemic, and related public health restrictions, including Host State prohibitions on public gatherings of more than five people, have required the Organization to reassess the feasibility of physically hosting in-person governing body meetings at its headquarters. In these exceptional circumstances, and relating only to the meetings of the WIPO Assemblies on May 7 and 8 to appoint the next Director General, the Organization has engaged in timely consultations and preparations to nevertheless ensure the orderly and effective conduct of these meetings in an alternative format. The challenges faced by the international community at this time are unprecedented, and ensuring that critical functions continue unimpeded requires innovation and agility within the applicable legal frameworks. It is for this reason that the following, necessarily equally unprecedented, written procedure is hereby proposed that would allow the WIPO General Assembly, the Paris Union Assembly, and the Berne Union Assembly to take relevant decisions at their May meeting for the successful discharge of their treaty obligations as part of the process of the election of the Director General. In the first instance, Member States are requested to respond affirmatively as to their agreement or disagreement to conduct the May 7 and 8 meeting of the WIPO Assemblies in the form of a written procedure by which they would consent to the draft decisions under consideration. Member States shall provide their affirmative responses to their respective Group Coordinators, who are requested, in turn, to transmit the positions of their Group Members, in writing, to the International Bureau no later than 5 p.m. April 20, 2020. The written responses of the Group Coordinators, on behalf of their Members, will be evidence of, and the basis for determining, whether the required quorum for the meeting of Member States, in the form of a written procedure, has been reached. 34 chemin des Colombettes 1211 Geneva 20 Switzerland T +4122 338 91 11 F +4122 733 54 28 www.wipo.int A/60/3 ANNEX IC.

In accordance with Article 6(3)(b) of the WIPO Convention, Article 1 3(4)(b) of the Paris Convention, and Article 22(3)(b) of the Berne Convention, one-half of the countries members of the respective Assembly shall constitute a quorum. If a quorum has been reached, and at least two-thirds of the Member States (representing the required majority pursuant to Articles 6(3)(d), 4 3(4)(d), and 22(3)(d) of the WIPO, Paris and Berne Conventions, respectively) consent, the decision to proceed with a written procedure, as set forth below, shall be considered adopted. The International Bureau will then communicate, via Group Coordinators, by April 22, 2020 whether quorum and the required majority to adopt the written procedure have been reached. In the second instance, should Member States agree to conduct the May 7 and 8 meeting of WIPO Assemblies in the form of a written procedure, they will authorize the Chair of the WIPO General Assembly to circulate, on April 27, 2020, the relevant draft decisions regarding the appointment of the next Director General for their consideration, and, in the absence of explicit objection, in the form of a negative written response, within 7 calendar days, or no later than 5 p.m. May 4, 2020, such decisions shall be considered adopted. Recognizing that no vote is technically possible and foreseen for the adoption of the draft decision(s) in accordance with the written procedure, it is therefore underscored that any explicit objection to the proposed decision(s) shall specify clearly the precise nature of the objection to allow the Chair of the WIPO General Assembly to determine its legal significance, if any, consistent with the applicable rule(s) of procedure. It is noted that Member States will have a separate opportunity to provide any written statements that they wish to be reflected in the official report of the meeting; the written procedure is exclusively for the purpose of adopting the decisions under consideration, and shall not be used as the format through which Member States make any general observations or interventions. Member States will be requested to provide any such statements to be included in the formal report of the meeting to the International Bureau by May 7, 2020. Thereafter, the relevant decisions shall be considered adopted and the meeting closed on May 8, 2020. In summary, the timeline of steps as part of the proposed written procedure are as follows: April 20 Deadline (5 p.m.) For Member States (via Group Coordinators) to respond affirmatively as to their agreement or disagreement regarding the proposal for written procedure. April 27 Chair of the WIPO General Assembly issues circular formally notifying the decisions to be taken in the May 7 and 8 meeting. May 4 Deadline (5 p.m.) for receipt of any explicit written objection to the decisions under consideration. May 7 Deadline (5 p.m.) for the receipt of any statements by Member States to be included in the Formal report or the meeting. May 8 Decisions considered adopted and meeting closed. A/60/3 Annex I, pageC. N 3989 3. It is recalled, once again, that the global Covid-19 pandemic has prompted the need for exceptional measures across all segments of society and governance. The proposed written procedure is therefore one such response in this context, and shall not be considered a precedent for the conduct of future meetings of the Assemblies of WIPO Member States in otherwise non-exceptional circumstances. Further, it is understood that decisions adopted as part of the written procedure were taken validly and consistent with the applicable legal framework and shall not be the subject of any challenge thereto.

General Assembly Fifty-Second (28th Extraordinary) Session Geneva, May 7 and 8, 2020 SUMMARY BY THE CHAIR prepared by the Chair WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANIZAT ION E WO/GAJ52/2 PROV. ORIGINAL: ENGLISH DATE: APRIL 27, 2020 1. On April 20, 2020, WIPO Member States agreed to the proposal of the Director General of WIPO, as contained in Note C. N 3989, to conduct, exceptionally, the May 7 and 8 meeting of the WIPO General Assembly, the Paris Union Assembly and the Berne Union Assembly to appoint the next Director General of WIPO in the form of a written procedure. In so doing, Member States authorized the Chair of the General Assembly, to circulate the draft decisions for their consideration, and, eventual adoption. 2. As per past practice, a \"Working Group on the Conditions of the appointment of the Director General-Elect\" (Working Group) was to be appointed by the WIPO General Assembly to provide recommendations on these conditions so that they may be fixed, or adopted, by the General Assembly. The Chair of the WIPO General Assembly presides over the Working Group, and the Chair of the WIPO Coordination Committee is its Vice-Chair . The other members of the Working Group consist of: ( 1) the Vice-Chairs of the WIPO General Assembly and of the WIPO Coordination Committee ; and (2) the Coordinators of the African Group, the Asia and Pacific Group (APG), the Group of Central Asian, Caucasus and Eastern European Countries (CACEEC), the Group of Central European and Baltic States (CEBS), Group B, the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries (GRULAC), and China. 3. Due to the restrictions in place as a result of the COVI D-19 pandemic, and consistent with the proposal for, and eventual agreement of Member States to proceed, exceptionally, with a written procedure for the conduct of these meetings, the Chair proposed a similarly exceptional approach to the work of the Working Group. As detailed in document WO/GA/52/1 Rev., the Chair proposed to convene the Working Group informally and to engage in consultations with it to provide recommendations regarding the conditions of appointment of the Director General. WO/GA/52/2 Prov. page 2 As further proposed in that document, the results of the informal consultations would be reflected in the present Summary by the Chair, to be annexed to the circular containing the proposed decisions for adoption as part of the written procedure agreed by Member States for the conduct of the May WIPO Assemblies. 4. To this end, the Chair invited views and comments from the Working Group as of April 20, 2020, on the draft contract for the Director General (as based on document WO/GA/52/1 Rev. ANNEX), so that any proposals or recommendations on which informal agreement had been reached could be reflected in the draft decisions circulated on April 27, 2020. The Chair also organized a virtual meeting on Wednesday, April 22, 2020, with the Working Group. 5. During the April 22 meeting, the Chair first noted that 151 Member States had responded affirmatively to confirm their consent to the written procedure, and had thereby authorized the Chair to circulate the draft decisions to which the present Summary by the Chair is annexed, and that reflect the informal consultations. The Chair of the WIPO Coordination Committee, His Excellency Franc;ois Rivasseau, Permanent Representative of France, the Vice-Chairs of the WIPO General Assembly, His Excellency Esmaeil Baghaei Hamaneh, Permanent Representative of Iran (Islamic Republic of), and His Excellency Victor Dolidze, Permanent Representative of Georgia, and the Vice-Chair of the WIPO Coordination Committee, His Excellency Andreana Erwin, Deputy Permanent Representative of Indonesia, all expressed their support both for the informal process underway and for the draft contract under consideration. 6. The Chair then requested Group Coordinators to express their views on behalf of their Group Members . Zimbabwe, on behalf of the African Group, expressed its support for the proposed conditions of appointment of the Director General, and the text of the contract, as currently drafted. 7. Singapore, on behalf of the APG, raised three points with respect to the process and substance of the conditions of appointment: (1) the two decisions, namely to appoint the next Director General, and to fix the conditions of his appointment, should be adopted at same time; (2) the conditions of the Director General appointment are also set out in the WIPO Convention and WIPO Staff Regulations and Rules; and (3) any changes to the contract should be limited to technical updates and details, such as contract dates and names of parties. 8. The Russian Federation, on behalf of CACEEC, noted that the benefits of the Director General are consistent with standards for agency Executive Heads and that its group is of the view that the current text of the contract is in line with established practice and should be left as is. CACEEC also agreed with the modalities as presented by the Chair, and they hoped to reach a mutually acceptable and consensual solution. 9. Latvia, on behalf of CEBS, expressed that it was pleased to hear that more than 150 Member States had accepted the written procedure, for which its group had a 1 00per cent response and acceptance rate. The Coordinator noted that while he had not seen other proposals, he noted that in the current, exceptional, circumstances, it would be difficult to conduct negotiations on any such proposal. Consequently, he recommended that the Working Group follow existing practice and adopt the draft contract as proposed. He also noted that he could anticipate work on proposed amendments for the following term of the Director General, to begin in six years, for which the Working Group would have a better opportunity to conduct negotiations. 10. China confirmed its support for the text of the contract as currently drafted. WO/GA/52/2 page 3 11. Germany, on behalf of Group B, noted that the agreement of over 150 Member States to the written procedure was a good result, and was also pleased to confirm that Group B similarly had a 100 per cent response and acceptance rate. The Coordinator then expressed his desire to make four points: (1) his Group could support the text of the contract as currently drafted for the term of the Director General beginning 2020; (2) due to the current extraordinary circumstances, Group B Members were not able to effectively engage in discussions on proposed amendments; (3) Group B would therefore refrain from introducing textual changes at this time, but requested that, before the 2021 Assemblies, the Chair of the General Assembly hold informal consultations concerning possible amendments as regards the term of the Director General beginning 2026; and (4) requested that this be reflected in the present Summary by the Chair. 12. Jamaica, on behalf of GRULAC, expressed its appreciation for the preparation of the working documents and the consultations, and was pleased to hear the large number of Member States responding affirmatively to the written procedure . The Coordinator noted that it had consulted with members of its Group on the draft text of the contract and that while a number of members had provided feedback, others were still consulting with capitals. It had not received any proposals for amendments, and, for Group members that provided feedback, they indicated their preference to avoid changes given that the current contract terms have worked effectively and that it was difficult to conduct negotiations in the absence of face-to-face meetings . Consequently, the status quo was best. The Coordinator added that any changes would need to be based on international law and applicable WIPO rules. Further, in these circumstances, consideration of and agreement to any changes would be difficult as some capitals were operating under emergency measures, which would cause delays. 13. In concluding the meeting, the Chair requested the Working Group to convey any additional comments by the close of business on April 23, 2020 so that they could be properly reflected in the Summary by the Chair and draft decisions, as appropriate. No further comments were received. 14. Consequently, in considering the conditions of the appointment of Mr. Daren Tang as Director General, the Working Group decided to recommend to the WIPO General Assembly the same conditions that the WIPO General Assembly approved in 2014 when Mr. Francis Gurry was appointed, modified to reflect an annual inflationary adjustment in respect of the housing and representation allowances in accordance with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Geneva. In addition to the representation and housing allowances stipulated in the contract, the Working Group also received, at the outset of the informal consultations, an indicative estimate of the monthly remuneration of Mr. Tang, provided by the International Bureau based on the United Nations common system financial parameters given in March 2020. The conditions of the appointment of Mr. Daren Tang as Director General, as reflected in the draft contract and indicative estimate of monthly remuneration, are set out in Annexes I and II, respectively, to this Summary by the Chair.
