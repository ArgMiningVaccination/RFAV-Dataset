This has given plenty of fans the chance to get ahold of The Callisto Protocol and complete the game in its entirety fairly quickly. With this, [an assortment of mixed reviews](https://www.cbr.com/the-callisto-protocol-stuttering-issues-steam-release/) for the game is beginning to pile up. The Callisto Protocol is brought to gamers by the same creator as the original Dead Space, Glen Schofield. This new game was reportedly going to be a spiritual successor to the Dead Space series, which was exciting news. Now that fans have had the chance to explore the world of The Callisto Protocol for themselves, it's a lot easier to look at The Callisto Protocol side by side next to the Dead Space franchise. So, now the question of whether The Callisto Protocol lives up to its spiritual predecessor can finally be answered. The Callisto Protocol Drips With Spine-Tingling Atmosphere In The Callisto Protocol, players take control of Jacob Lee. He works for a delivery service, hauling cargo through outer space. The game really begins when Jacob is wrongfully arrested and taken to a remote prison on a moon called Callisto. From there, things take a turn for the worst, and Jacob is forced to fight for his life while trying to escape. While the storyline and protagonist are fresh, there are still many similarities that can be tied back to Dead Space. The \"need to escape\" that the player feels throughout the game is not at all foreign to the Dead Space series, and although [the environments and settings are different](https://www.cbr.com/survival-horror-games-setting-era-dead-space/), they are all dark, eerie, and claustrophobic in the best ways possible. This is by no means a bad thing since this is not uncommon in sci-fi horror games and is one of the many enjoyable highlights of Dead Space. In fact, the environment and graphics are one of the best things about The Callisto Protocol. It's quite easy to feel entranced by the vast number of ominous hallways and dark rooms crawling with mutated enemies. Both the visual and the sound designs play huge roles in the game's personality, and much of it is quite cinematic thanks to good performances by Josh Duhamel, who plays the protagonist, and the supporting characters. The game starts to fall short, however, when looking at its other elements like originality and combat. How The Callisto Protocol's Combat Falls Short It's no secret that even though the game has only been available for a short amount of time, a lot of The Callisto Protocol's reviews have been negative, and there are a few good reasons for this. Perhaps the most obvious reason is how the combat works. Similar to Dead Space, Jacob has to watch his ammo count and apply some strategy to make sure he doesn't end up in a tight spot. To account for this, Jacob always has an electric baton at his disposal, which can even be upgraded like his guns. This encourages the player to balance gunplay with plenty of melee combat, but the melee leaves something to be desired. Enemies can creep off the screen fairly regularly due to the fixed camera angles and the game has implemented a rather necessary yet awkward dodging mechanic that opens up enemies to [attacks which can become repetitive](https://www.cbr.com/the-callisto-protocol-review/). The enemies in The Callisto Protocol are quite unique and conceptually terrifying, but the truth is that there are only a handful of combatants that the player will ever face, which can add to the repetitive feeling. On top of this, The Callisto Protocol doesn't take enough risks in [branching out from the original Dead Space](http://www.cbr.com/striking-distance-callisto-protocol-dead-space-retread/) aesthetic. In both games the protagonist's health bar physically appears on their body, inventory space must be handled with care, gadgets allow the protagonist to use telekinesis to their advantage, and stomping on corpses is essential to gathering loot. The Callisto Protocol Is More Dead Space's Twin Than Its Successor In conclusion, The Callisto Protocol undoubtedly lives up to the original Dead Space game, but this is because it also doesn't stray enough from the formula to improve upon it either, save for more gory deaths. The graphics, environment, and overall atmosphere are high points in the game that contribute to it being genuinely enjoyable. However, there are also many [flaws and bugs in the game](https://www.cbr.com/the-callisto-protocol-stuttering-issues-steam-release/) which are reminiscent of Dead Space in themselves. Those who enjoyed the Dead Space series will surely enjoy The Callisto Protocol, but they probably won't find too many differences between the two. "}
