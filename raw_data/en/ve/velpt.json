Reiki is a form of energy work. It can help improve your mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing, and provide a deep sense of relaxation by helping you restore harmony within yourself and between you and the world around you. How does it work? Reiki seeks to normalize the flow of energy within your body, much like a circuit breaker normalizes the flow of electricity in your house, to help you be your very best self. It can calm overactive energies (like mind racing or feelings of anxiety) and raise dampened energies (like brain fog or sluggishness). Your energies include your thoughts, emotions, electrical charges, mental states, stress levels, physical feelings, and moods. When your energies are off kilter, physical, mental, emotional, & spiritual challenges can come up - We've all heard of stress causing heart palpitations, high blood pressure, & ulcers. Reiki can fine-tune your energies, allowing you to better cope with stress, improve your body's natural ability to heal itself, and help bring you more in alignment with your best self. Reiki is used to restore the proper flow of your universal life energy (also called 'ki', 'chi', or simply 'energy'). Acupuncture is another, sometimes more well-known form of energetic healing. However, unlike acupuncture, Reiki healing uses light touch, rather than needles. This light touch, accompanied by a soothing setting in the treatment room (or at home, during Distance Reiki sessions), can provide healing & restore harmony to your energies while also providing deep relaxation. Reiki does not involve massage, but can be just as relaxing as a massage - sometimes much more so! Reiki is always done with the client fully clothed and comfortable. Who needs Reiki? Top reasons clients seek out Reiki healing sessions: The Dr. Vicky Difference Most Reiki healers are licensed bodyworkers of some variety, commonly massage therapists. Dr. Vicky is one of few physicians in the Greater St. Louis area offering Reiki. What does that mean for you? While Reiki is often paired with modern Western Medicine, even to the level of hospitals, to aid the body in its natural ability to heal, it cannot be used to diagnose, treat, or cure any medical condition. However, a Reiki healer will often notice areas where a client may need to seek a doctor's opinion. A non-physician Reiki healer would tell you, \"You should see a doctor to investigate more about XYZ.\" And let's be honest: you'll probably forget all about it or put it off for a good long while. Here's the Dr. Vicky Difference: Because she's a physician, she CAN diagnose & treat a variety of conditions. If something comes up during your Reiki session that needs a doctor's attention, you've got a doctor right there who can investigate the issue as soon as your Reiki treatment is completed, or schedule a time for you to follow up on the problem so that you DON'T forget all about it or put it off. And if it's an issue that needs attention from a different specialist, Dr. Vicky will know just who to refer you to for the care you need. And for a super-powered boost, combine chiropractic & Reiki! Chiropractic care can help your body be its very best; Reiki can help your mind, emotions, and spirit be their very best. The two combined can bring out the ultimate in You At Your Very Best!
