GOVERNOR Kelly Garcia DIRECTOR Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program PRIORIX (MMR) Vaccine Summary January 2023 Purpose of Vaccine Summary Effective January 18, 2023 , PRIORIX (MMR) vaccine , manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals is to order through the Iowa VFC Program. PRIORIX (MMR) Vaccine Recommendations Food and Drug Administration (FDA) June 6, 2022 the FDA licensed PRIORIX (MMR) for use in individuals aged 12 months and older. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine (PRIORIX): Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2014 United States, 2022 VFC Resolution The Federal VFC Program follows the ACIP recommendations for the use of PRIORIX (MMR) vaccine for VFC eligible children 12 months through 18 years of age. ACIP Recommended Schedule for MMR Vaccine PRIORIX is recommended according to the existing MMR recommended schedules and off -label uses as an option to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella. Routine vaccination 2 doses are recommended, the first at age 12 -15 months, and the second at age 4 -6 years. Catch -up vaccination For previously unvaccinated children and adolescents, 2 doses should be administered > 4 weeks apart. Before internationa l travel, infants 6 -11 months should receive a single dose. Travelers aged > 12 months who have not received 2 doses of MMR should receive 2 doses separated by > 28 days. During a measles outbreak, infants aged 6 -11 months should receive a single dose of MMR. For measles postexposure prophylaxis in unvaccinated persons, 1 dose of MMR should be administered within 72 hours of exposure to a person with infectious measles, and the 2 -dose series (i.e., the second of 2 MMR doses) should be completed 28 days la ter. During mumps outbreaks, a third dose of MMR is 2 recommended for persons identified by public health authorities as being part of a group or population at increased risk for acquiring mumps because of an outbreak. Interchangeability PRIORIX and M -M-R II are fully interchangeable. ACIP General Best Practices states a preference that doses of vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer; however, vaccination should not be deferred when the manufacturer of the previously administe red vaccine is unknown or when the vaccine from the same manufacturer is unavailable. Timing of Vaccination and Coadministration with Other Vaccines PRIORIX can be administered concomitantly, at different anatomic sites, with other routine childhood vaccines. Live virus vaccines not given on the same day should be separated by > 4 weeks. Recommended Dosage and Administration The recommended dose is 0.5mL administered as a subcutaneous injection for both M -M-R II and PRIORIX vaccines.

M-M-R II is a susp ension for injection supplied as a lyophilized vaccine to be reconstituted using accompanying sterile diluent.
