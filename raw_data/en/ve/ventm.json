Reiki, pronounced \"ray-key\", is an energy healing technique originating from Japan. The word Reiki itself translates to 'universal life energy' and is based on the belief that life energy flows through all living things. If this energy becomes unbalanced, low or stuck, it is believed that we are more likely to become stressed and unwell. The relaxing nature of Reiki can be especially helpful for those who may be feeling disconnected, isolated or overwhelmed. A Reiki treatment can help to bring about a sense of peace and centeredness which activates the body's natural healing abilities. When used in conjunction with other medical treatments, rebalancing energy can help to manage symptoms of anxiety, fatigue and pain. Reiki can be used for short-term problems or in an ongoing way to promote overall health and well-being.

HUNA Huna is a modern day name given to an ancient Hawaiian shamanic system of healing that was originally called Ho'omana. Ho'o means \"to make\" and mana together, the word Ho'omana means empowerment or to empower. The healing practice of Huna allows us to tap into our inner resources at the deepest level, working with the understanding that we have three minds and four bodies. The purpose then is to bring the three minds (subconscious mind, conscious mind and higher self) and the energy of the four bodies (physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual) into balance and harmony by using and understanding the 7 principles of Huna. Huna teaches us to live in the moment, to be mindful, to take control of our thoughts and perceptions, and to understand that love and compassion can lead to happiness. Ultimately, it is the idea that real power lies within ourselves. If you Have Any Questions Schedule an Appointment "}
