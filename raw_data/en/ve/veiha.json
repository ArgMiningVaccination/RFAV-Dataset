Children aged 6 months --8 years who did not receive at least 1 dose of an influenz a A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine, who have never received a seasonal influenza vaccine before, or who were vaccinated for the first time with the seasonal 2009 --10 seasonal vaccine but who received only 1 dose should receive 2 doses of the 2010 --11 influ enza vaccine formula, spaced 4 or more weeks apart. \u00a7 For adults and older children, the recommended site of vaccination is the deltoid muscle. The preferred site for infants and young children is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. \u00b6 Afluria (CSL Bioth erapies) is approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration for use in persons aged 6 months and older . However, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that the 2010 --11 formulation of Afluria not be administered to c hildren aged 6 months --8 years because of an increased frequency of fever or febrile seizures reported among young children (mostly children aged younger than 5 years) who received a similar vaccine in Australia in 2010. Therefore, another age -appropriate, licensed seasonal influenza vaccine formulation should be used for prevention of influenza in children aged 6 months --8 years. If no other age -appropriate, licensed seasonal influenza vaccine is available for a child aged 5 --8 years who has a medical cond ition that increases the child's risk for influenza complications, Afluria may be given. P roviders should discuss with the parents or caregivers the benefits and risks of influenza vaccination with Afluria before administering this vaccine. See second foot note above for dose information when administering Afluria to children aged 5 --8 years. ** Trivalent inactivated vaccine high dose. A 0.5 -mL dose FluMist is shipped refrigerated and stored in the refrigerator at 36 \u00b0F--46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C--8\u00b0C) after arrival in the vaccination clinic. The dose is 0.2 mL divided equally between each nostril. Health -care pr oviders should consult the medical record, when available, to identify children aged 2 --4 years with asthma or recurrent wheezing that might indicate asthma. In addition, to identify children who might be at greater risk for asthma and possibly at increase d risk for wheezing after receiving LAIV, parents or caregivers of children aged 2 --4 years should be asked: \"In the past 12 months, has a health -care provider ever told you that your child had wheezing or asthma?\" Children whose parents or caregivers answ er \"yes\" to this question and children who have asthma or who had a wheezing episode noted in the medical record within the past 12 months should not "}
