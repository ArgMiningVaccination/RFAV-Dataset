Medicine has evolved into a solid platform where treatment for the most rigid and life-threatening diseases is readily available. The oldest form of medicine is known to us as Ayurveda - a sophisticated combination of six crucial Indian philosophical, medical, physical and behavioral systems. Primarily in Ayurveda, the emphasis is given on herbal remedies with diet modification for treatment. Add-on therapies include massage and meditation to balance body \"doshas\" that in turn eliminate impurities, boost immunity, and create a sense of harmony in the body and way of thinking. \"Ayur\" meaning life and \"veda\" meaning knowledge, comprise a conceptual system based on the balance and disorder of human ecology and behavioral patterns. It is a combined assessment of the collective \"mind-body-senses-spirit.\" Origin of Ayurveda The history of Ayurveda can be traced back to 6000 B.C., but is said to have existed since the inception of the creation of mankind. It is a subsection of the Atharva Veda, and delivers the information to achieve a healthy and balanced life according to the sacred texts. Ayurveda greatly influenced healthcare practices in the past and was administered through oral practice. In the old days, Brahmins were considered learned physicians who knew the principle of healing. Despite this, with time other castes began to take interest as civilization advanced. After 1500 B.C., Ayurveda became so extensive that it was divided into eight branches of medicine. Atreya - the school of physicians and Dhanvantri - the school of surgeons were the additional legs of this medical system. India further welcomed the Tibetans, Chinese, Romans, Greeks, Persians, Afghans and Egyptians who came to India to understand and learn treatment and healing. Ayurveda means \" science of life\" and is considered the gift of Gods in the Sanskrit sagas written by Indian saints. Rishi-munis in India have spent years studying the science and exploring its ways of healing. Ayurvedic Body Types \"Prakriti\" or nature of a person's body, is characterized into three energies in Ayurveda - pitta, kapha and vata. It is imperative in Ayurveda to have these energies balanced for better health. Prakriti explains why different bodies react differently to the exact same things. Pitta - Constitutes fire and water - higher or lower levels result in inflammation, infections, and ulcers Vata - Constitutes space and air - imbalances result in constipation, arthritis, and anxiety Kapha - Constitutes water and earth - imbalances create obesity, diabetes, and congestive disorders Ayurvedic Treatments Panchakarma, Shamana, and Bhrimana are three essential treatments in Ayurveda. Panchakarma - this is the therapy of elimination. The process eliminates impurities through enemas, massages, and medical oils. Nasal administration, medicated enemas, purgation, blood-letting, and vomiting are used to cleanse the body. Shamana - this is the therapy of pacification, used for balancing opposites with the help of dietary and lifestyle changes. Complimentary activities that aid these therapies are [yoga](https://www.yo1.com/curative-therapies/yoga.html), meditation, and herbal administration. Bhrimana - these are nourishing therapies used for treatment of strength or emaciation issues. Ayurveda To Improve Health Ayurveda is a tool to uproot the cause of diseases from your body.
