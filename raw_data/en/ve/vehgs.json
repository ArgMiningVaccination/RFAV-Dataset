There are two types of sugar in this world: the good and the bad. You'll find the good kind in fruits as fructose and in dairy products as lactose. While there's a significant amount of sugar in these foods, they're also rich in fiber and contain vitamins that are important for a healthy diet. The bad kind of sugar is refined sugar, which appears in desserts, condiments, soda, and processed foods. \"It's known as sucrose,\" says dietitian [Rachel Link](https://nutrimental.co), and it derives from processing cane sugar. Eight months ago, I cut refined sugar\u2014the bad type\u2014out of my diet. My holistic doctor suggested quitting might help me get a handle on the unexplained lethargy, acne, and headaches I was experiencing. It wasn't easy, but I managed to go from more than 70 grams of refined sugar a day to eating less than 20. I'd constantly consult a list of foods to avoid that was secured to my refrigerator door (now my mom, boyfriend, and I have it memorized). Holidays are a true test of willpower, and going out to eat is considered a cheat, because you can't know what's in food if you're not cooking it. Here's how my life changed. My Energy Levels Stay Consistent Little did I know how much sugar was affecting my mood before this lifestyle change. \"By far, the most important association between refined sugar and the human body is its effect on insulin,\" explains Mark Smith, a nutrition counselor and chiropractor. Because all hormones are driven or affected by insulin, my sex, stress, hunger, and metabolic hormones were out of whack. So it's no surprise that I noticed a substantial, steady increase in energy after four weeks of going without this roller coaster ingredient in my diet. I'm no longer dragging throughout my day wishing I could lie down for a nap. Now, I wake in the morning with drive, and have that same motivation to hit the road for a run after work. My Immune System Seems Stronger Since I started this journey eight months ago, I haven't had one cold, which is a big deal for me, because I use to get sick at least once every season. Sugar has a major impact on harmful bacteria found in the intestines, explains lifestyle medicine physician assistant [Kate Martino](http://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/wellbeing/6-things-that-happened-when-i-stopped-eating-sugar/slide/katemartino.com). Poor immune function is one major downfall of a weak digestive system. \"When you reduce or eliminate sugar, it helps health-promoting bacteria flourish and heal the lining of the intestines,\" says Martino. I've replaced refined sugar in my diet with oranges, [strawberries](http://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/garden/strawberry), honey, and other nutrient-rich foods that help keep my digestive system in check and my immune system healthy. I'm Dealing With Less Inflammation I use to get horrible headaches, and have a lot of inflammation on my face in the form of acne. \"High blood sugar levels damage your body's tissue and triggers an inflammatory response,\" says Dan Figio, author of [Beating Sugar Addiction for Dummies](http://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/wellbeing/6-things-that-happened-when-i-stopped-eating-sugar/slide/BeatingSugarAddiction.com) and Sugar Free Me. Inflammatory responses can range from bloating to rashes to joint pain. Since reducing my refined sugar intake, my face has cleared with the exception of a few breakouts, and my headaches are more situational (like if I cheat or I'm tired) and easier to manage. I Learned How To Read Food Labels When I started reading food labels, I was truly shocked by the amount of foods that contain refined sugar: It's in red sauce, wheat cereal, and plain yogurt, to name just a few of my common grocery purchases from before I cut sugar. It's a little scary, too, because refined sugar is disguised in food labels\u2014look out for dextrin, corn syrup, or anything ending in \"-ose,\" advises Link. \"On food labels, ingredients are arranged in order of quantity, from greatest to least,\" she explains. \"So anytime you spot it in the first three ingredients, an alarm should go off that it's high in added sugar.\" When I first started grocery shopping for my new lifestyle, it took me twice as long, because I had to stop and read the labels of every item I picked up. But after two months, I had a solid sugar-free list of snacks and meals I enjoy. Now I breeze through the store filling my cart with fresh vegetables and corn chips. I Found Healthy Alternatives I'm a huge fan of ice cream, so this switch was tough for me. My cravings were noticeable for the first three weeks. I'd grumpily cut up a banana and some strawberries, or spread [almond butter](http://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=almond+butter) and real maple syrup over a rice cake as an after dinner snack. But by the fourth week, my cravings started to dull, and I was getting better at alternative snacks. Martino suggests, \"Sweeten things with whole foods like dates, figs, or pineapple. They're high in sugar, but slow down the sugar absorption.\" I also started pairing sweet fruits like apples with a handful of nuts or a bit of fatty peanut butter. \"The protein and fiber slow the absorption of sugar, keeping your hormone levels and mood stable,\" says Martino. I Met Like-Minded People Within this dietary shift, my social life started to change in ways I hadn't expected. \"You start to meet like-minded people who are more aware and able to listen to what their bodies need,\" says [Samantha Krief](http://samanthaelkrief.com), holistic health and wellness coach. My inner circle was suddenly filled with mindful, compassionate, and curious friends who studied everything from energy medicine to herbalism. Now, if I have a question about my diet or need a sugar-free snack recommendation, I happily consult my friends.
