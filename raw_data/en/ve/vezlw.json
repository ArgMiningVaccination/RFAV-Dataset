In 2015, Gallagher established the Rush University College of Nursing Sue Gin Health Center, a faculty-practice, nurse-managed, primary care clinic and wellness center located within the Oakley Square Apartments complex on the Near West Side of Chicago. Prior to the opening of the clinic, the largely uninsured population at Oakley Square Apartments often used emergency rooms for their primary care. At the clinic, Gallagher joins with another nurse practitioner and Rush nursing students to provide primary care, deliver preventive screenings and promote health education. \"Residents were not using the clinic at first due to mistrust of health care settings and providers,\" says Gallagher's nominator, Wrenetha A. Julion, PhD, MPH, RN, FAAN, professor and chairperson, Department of Women, Children and Family Nursing. \"Therese took active steps to establish trusting relationships with community residents and encourage their involvement in the health center. She sought the perspectives of community residents.\" The Sue Gin Health Center now serves approximately 600 residents in 247 apartments. \"Under Terry's leadership, the Sue Gin Health Center has partnered with more than 15 local community organizations \u2014 such as the YMCA, Chicago School of Psychology, American Lung Association and the Museum of Science and Industry \u2014 to bring programs and services to Oakley Square residents,\" says Angela Moss, PhD, APRN-BC, RN, assistant professor, Department of Community, Systems and Mental Health Nursing. Additionally, Gallagher is a nurse practitioner at the school-based health centers at Richard T. Crane Medical Prep and the Orr Academy High School. She volunteers at the Franciscan House of Mary and Joseph, a 257-bed homeless shelter on Chicago's West Side, and oversees an interprofessional, student-led clinic run by the Rush Community Service Initiatives Program. \"Her work is not only highly innovative, but it also demonstrates the high level of respect and regard she holds for the community,\" Julion says.

Roehl joined the Rush family in 2007 as a master's student and returned in 2010 after working as a consulting dietitian. Roehl's clinical practice is primarily focused on two areas: nutrition support for patients in the neuroscience intensive care unit and the ketogenic diet as a treatment for intractable epilepsy. Roehl works with other dietitians to ensure the best care is provided to the inpatient population. She rounds daily as part of the interprofessional neuroscience intensive care unit team to provide essential nutrition support for critically ill patients. Her patient-centered approach leads to successful implementation of the ketogenic diet. \"She practices at the highest level, combining the latest evidence and critical thinking skills to provide paramount nutrition care for her patients,\" says Yimin Chen, PhD, RD, LDN, assistant professor, Department of Clinical Nutrition. Roehl is a member of Rush's dietetic internship acceptance committee, as well as a preceptor for three major rotations, including enteral nutrition, neurology and critical care. During these rotations, Roehl instructs interns on how to incorporate advanced-level and critical care skills into practice, which sets the program apart as a leading dietetic internship. She has received the Best Preceptor award at Rush in three of the past six years. Roehl participates in the Chicago Area Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, most recently holding the role of immediate past president. She remains actively involved in the planning and execution of chapter events. She also participates in the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, or ASPEN. She recently completed a two-year, co-chair responsibility on the committee for Self-Assessment, which is a tool offered to help multidisciplinary nutrition support clinicians prepare for the exam to become a certified nutrition support clinician. Roehl remains an active member of the abstract review committee, helping to determine quality and acceptance of research abstracts and presentations for ASPEN's national conference. In addition, she is an active member of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, or AND, participating in its Dietitians in Nutrition Support practice group and serving as an editor for the quarterly, peer-reviewed publication Support Line. In 2016, Roehl was selected to be the lead author on the first AND practice paper focusing on the ketogenic diet for the treatment of epilepsy, which is shaping the understanding and implementation of ketogenic diet therapy for registered dietitian nutritionists across the country. Roehl has presented research on ketogenic diet therapy at several national and international multidisciplinary conferences. She was recently selected to be a speaker at the fall 2018 Global Symposium on Ketogenic Diet Therapies in Jeju, South Korea.

In 20 years as an occupational therapist, she has worked in inpatient psychiatry, acute care medicine, outpatient pediatrics and long-term care with individuals who have varying abilities and impairments. Her interest in advocacy stems from her daily exposure to people with different abilities and challenges. \"Dr. Bathje is a leader who is making significant contributions in efforts to transform health care so that people with disabilities receive excellent health care services,\" says her nominator, Sarah Ailey, PhD, RNC, professor, Department of Community, Systems and Mental Health Nursing. For the past eight years, Bathje has participated as a member of the Adults With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities committee at Rush, which focuses on improving the patient experience of adults with intellectual disabilities. She is involved with the Special Friends Mass, which is offered monthly through her church and is designed for people with intellectual disabilities and their families who aren't able to participate in the regular mass. They modify the liturgy and environment to support and celebrate participants who are differently abled. Bathje has taught volunteers in the Trinity Volunteer Corps, an organization that promotes volunteerism for adults with intellectual disabilities, and is involved with the Fabretto Children's Foundation, which supports education programs in Nicaragua. She has also been involved with Path to Academics Community and Employment, or PACE, a postsecondary education program designed to meet the transitional needs of young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Bathje facilitated a PACE student internship at the College of Health Sciences. In 2016, Bathje collaborated with colleagues to obtain a conference grant from both the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Working for Inclusive and Transformative Healthcare Foundation to fund a conference for Partnering to Transform Healthcare With People With Disabilities, a collaboration between Rush and the University of Illinois at Chicago focused on the disparity of health outcomes in people with disabilities. The conference resulted in several ongoing work groups that include a national representation of professionals and self-advocates, including a work group led by Bathje that focuses on employment of people with disabilities in health care settings. Bathje participates in Back on My Feet, a national organization that uses the power of running to combat homelessness by providing housing, job skills and employment opportunities. Bathje's running team in Chicago, which includes students at Rush, runs with individuals from St. Leonard's Shelter on Chicago's Near West Side three times a week to establish routine and provide support. Bathje was the Illinois Occupational Therapist of the year in 2015 and a nominee for Rush's 2017 Robert J. Clapp Diversity Leadership Award.

EXCELLENCE IN MENTORING 9 Back to table of contents.Joyce Corsica Joyce Corsica, PhD, associate professor in Rush Medical College's Department of Behavioral Sciences, has been the director of Clinical Training for the clinical psychology internship at Rush since 2006. She is also the associate chair of Professional Development in the department, directing faculty mentorship efforts for professional development and career advancement. \"As a former resident and postdoctoral fellow at Rush who trained under Dr. Corsica, I am honored to represent the overwhelming and enthusiastic support for this nomination she has received from her former interns,\" says Megan Hood, PhD, associate professor, Department of Behavioral Science and Corsica's nominator. In her 16 years at Rush, Corsica has mentored more than 100 doctoral residents, 16 postdoctoral fellows and 10 junior faculty members. Her students, residents and postdoctoral fellows have gone on to secure their top choice for their next position, pass their licensure exam on the first try and secure scientist-practitioner positions at high level institutions worldwide. Her mentees have gone on to focus on research, teaching and clinical work, and frequently take on leadership and mentorship roles themselves. \"Even after nine years as her colleague, she is still the first person I turn to when I need guidance,\" says Nicole Heath, PhD, assistant professor, Department of Behavioral Sciences. \"I have complete confidence that the vast majority of the trainees and assistant professors in our department share this perspective. Despite her extensive experience in academia and her seniority in the department, she has always treated me as an equal and has created a caring environment where I and other mentees are treated with the utmost respect.\" Corsica's mentees have been the most frequently hired faculty members at Rush, with a total of 13 hired (including Hood) after completing their training. Her trainees have also gone on to become successful leaders at other institutions, including Northwestern and Loyola, and have produced hundreds of publications, demonstrating substantial impact in the clinical and health psychology field. \"During my internship year, I saw that, despite Dr. Corsica's multiple responsibilities, she always had an open-door policy,\" says Shawn N. Hondorp, PhD, ABPP , clinical health psychologist, Division of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, Preventive Cardiology and Surgical Weight Loss, Spectrum Health System. \"My desire to continue to learn from Dr. Corsica was the number one reason I chose to stay at Rush for my postdoctoral fellowship.\" \"Her excellence is apparent in so many ways,\" Hood says, \"but most notably in the fact that she inspires her mentees to want to become excellent mentors themselves, further expanding the number of people who will benefit from her influence.\" EXCELLENCE IN MENTORINGFaculty Recognition RECEPTION 10 Back to table of contents.Vineet Gupta, PhD, is the vice chair for Research and Innovation, a professor in Rush Medical College's Department of Internal Medicine, director of the Section of Research within the Division of Hematology/Oncology and the director of the Drug Discovery Center. Gupta is a leader in developing novel mechanism of action small molecules as therapeutics for autoimmunity, cancer and kidney diseases, targeting integrins and other cellular receptors. \"Many discoveries coming out of his laboratory have enhanced the recognition of Rush in the eyes of the global research community,\" says Alan Landay, PhD, professor, Department of Microbial Pathogens and Immunity. Gupta has been studying integrin CD11b/ITGAM for more than 15 years. In the past, targeting integrins with blocking agents had been the primary strategy for reducing leukocyte influx. Gupta and his lab recognized that integrin activation could also be a pharmacologically targetable methodology and may overcome the limitation associated with the anti-integrin agents. Gupta's lab developed novel small molecules that selectively activate CD11b/CD18 in vitro and in vivo, and used them to prove that integrin activation \u2014 by transiently enhancing leukocyte adhesion to inflamed endothelium \u2014 also reduces their extravasation and inflammatory injury. His studies found that CD11b activation seems to regulate TLR pathways. Gupta's work was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in 2017, highlighted in Nature Reviews Nephrology and selected as one of the three top papers in rheumatology at the Annual American College of Rheumatology meeting in 2017. His lab's current work focuses on understanding the changes that accompany integrin activation. They plan to initiate a phase I clinical trial of their lead compound (LA1) in 2018. Their unpublished research shows that LA1 can modulate tumor infiltration of tumor-assisted macrophages, which is a novel immuno- oncology therapeutic paradigm that has shown to reduce tumor growth in multiple mouse models. Additionally, Gupta's laboratory helped define the role of integrins V3 and 1 in proteinuric kidney diseases, discovering how these integrins modulate function of a key kidney cell, the podocyte. They helped establish that de-activation of integrin 1 in podocytes is a key factor that leads to podocyte damage and showed that integrin 1 agonists have therapeutic efficacy in vivo. In contrast, activation of V3 in podocytes results in significant cellular injury and loss, suggesting blocking V3 may be a more promising approach for that integrin in podocytes. In addition, Gupta and his collaborators have developed and described a novel podocyte cell-based high throughput screening assay for the discovery and development of novel kidney-specific therapeutics. Gupta has published multiple articles in high-impact journals, has been an inventor on more than 40 patents and patent applications and has mentored more than 45 students and fellows in his laboratory during the last several years. \"Dr. Gupta has been continuously funded by the NIH and other external foundations, and is routinely invited to present nationally and internationally,\" says Jochen Reiser, MD, PhD, Gupta's nominator and chairperson, Department of Internal Medicine. \"His research findings undoubtedly will transform the fields of autoimmunity and immuno-oncology.\" Faculty Recognition RECEPTION Vineet GuptaEXCELLENCE IN RESEARCH 11 Back to table of contents.Professors Edward Barker, PhD Microbial Pathogens and Immunity Rush Medical College Jennifer Goldman, MD, MS Neurological SciencesRush Medical College David Gurka, MD Internal MedicineRush Medical College Deborah Hall, PhD Neurological SciencesRush Medical College Sanda Predescu, PhD Internal MedicineRush Medical College Steven Rothschild, MD Preventive MedicineRush Medical CollegeTheodore Saclarides, MD SurgeryRush Medical College R.
