Herb stands for Home Exploring Robot Butler, but the name is also a homage to Herbert A. Simon, the AI pioneer and renowned CMU professor. History Herb was created by a team led by [Siddhartha Srinivasa](https://goodrobot.ai/) at Carnegie Mellon, in 2006. Initial funding came from Intel and the Quality of Life Technology Center, a National Science Foundation engineering research center focused on creating intelligent systems that work symbiotically with people in everyday tasks. The first version, called the Busboy, consisted of a wandering Segway RMP 200 mobile base and a single Barrett WAM arm mounted on a pedestal. In 2008, the group built the next version, Herb 1.0, making improvements to the manipulator. In 2010, the researchers redesigned the entire robot from scratch, creating Herb 2.0, with two arms and a head, custom electronics, cooling, and power to last up to six hours untethered. [Srinivasa](https://goodrobot.ai/) is now a professor at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), where he heads the [Personal Robotics Lab](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/).
