Vision is something that is hoped for but not yet seen. The vision is what leads you on, what directs you and points the way. In the old times, each young man was encouraged to seek a vision, and native women were also free to do this. In seeking the vision, one would go out and pray. What shall be my purpose in life, Great Spirit? How can I best serve the needs of my people? What is my part in the universe? With the vision comes the power of direction. In several of my visions, I saw a time when we would all live together as brothers and sisters, Indian and non-Indian alike. I saw the Earth Mother being healed as people began to show a love for the land. But first, I saw the possibility of a time of great desolation, a time of hunger, drought, and illness. From my visions I knew I must teach people to be self-reliant, to heal themselves and this planet, our Earth Mother. As time went on, I began my work with The Bear Tribe Medicine Society. Later, the vision of the Medicine Wheel came to me and then started to unfold. In my vision of the Medicine Wheel, I saw an inner and outer circle of stones with rocks placed like the spokes of a wheel connecting the two. Inside the sacred circle was the buffalo skull. People wearing animal costumes and headdresses represented the four directions and all the other powers of the universe. Each person was singing the song of his season, of his mineral, of his plant, and of his totem animal. And they were singing songs for the healing of the Earth Mother. A leader among them was saying, Let the medicine of the sacred circle prevail. Let many people across the land come to the circle and make prayers for the healing of the Earth Mother. Let the circles of the Medicine Wheel come back. They have. Since 1980 the Bear Tribe has sponsored an average of four Medicine Wheel Gatherings each year. Usually 400 to 1,200 people attend each gathering, and many of them go on to build their own Medicine Wheels. In the years since my first vision much work has been done to increase harmony between people and the Earth Mother. I am very happy to continue to live by my visions and see them grow. It is good to see people becoming more self-reliant and utilizing many of the tools we have made available. Now I see a need for a better understanding of health and healing on a personal level. Learning to be self-reliant in healing yourself is of utmost importance. The stronger and healthier we are as spiritual warriors, the more we will have to give of ourselves to the continual healing of the Earth Mother. Good health makes it easier for us to do our part in the universe, to serve our people, and for each of us to fulfill our personal life visions. To have a lifetime plan of action to support and promote your spiritual, physical, emotional, and mental well-being is a wise path to walk. In this book we will be sharing many specific tools that will assist you to walk in balance and to achieve the best health possible. Walk in Balance first gives you a philosophy that encourages health. Ninety percent of all illness begins in the head. You must get rid of the mind creatures which predispose you to illness. Then, by learning what is good for you, opening up to the universe, and finding ways to be happier, you can begin working toward a longer and more fulfilling life. For your work to be successful you need the proper tools\u2014acceptance of the life force in all its forms, good diet, and revitalizing exercise. Walk in Balance discusses all these tools, and helps you to plan your own healthful path to power. Given the amount of negative attitudes we've all been fed from birth, and the state of the environment, many of us will experience some form of dis-ease. The final chapters of Walk in Balance are about different ways of preventing dis-ease and of dealing with illness if it happens\u2014herbal remedies, healing ceremonies, other natural alternatives, resources, and people. This book is a comprehensive manual to help you walk in balance, health, and beauty on the Earth Mother. Two new coauthors have joined Wabun and me in preparing Walk in Balance. They are Crysalis Mulligan and Peter Sentinel Bear Nufer. Crysalis Mulligan (Emerging Butterfly Woman) is one of my apprentices, a pipe woman, founder of the Nurture Nature Program, and an avid environmentalist and conservationist. Crysalis is a holistic healer who has been working with stone therapy for almost a decade. She owns crystal mining claims and has been mining, researching, and sharing her crystal knowledge for the same amount of time. In her early twenties, she developed health problems. With diet, nutrition, a spiritual path, the support of traditional and holistic medicine, and a good attitude she has added years to her life. She feels that it is not everyone's path to experience total healing. For many walking in balance means being alive and fulfilled despite some forms of dis-ease. She brings her first-hand experience dealing with illness and healing to the writing of this book. Peter Sentinel Bear Nufer is an acclaimed survivalist and camping expert. As a wilderness experience trainer and educator, Sentinel Bear has brought a unique hands-on perspective of the wilds to many people. Peter is accredited within the television industry as an associate producer, assistant director, and director of photography on three documentaries that were Emmy-nominated and given bronze medals by the Film and Television Festival of New York. He is a pipecarrier who works in affiliation with Sun Bear and The Bear Tribe. Crysalis and Peter Sentinel Bear Nufer are co-owners of the Red Road Trading Company. The illness and death of his father caused Peter to explore alternative methods of health and healing. Over the years, Peter has found diet, exercise, and, most of all, attitude to be the best formula for continued health and happiness. Over the years, Wabun and I have also worked with a variety of preventive medicine techniques\u2014and with illness when it has occurred. We've experienced self-healing, ceremonial healing, and a good number of the alternative methods we write about. Among the four of us, we've also experienced enough of western medicine to know some ways to make it work better for you. Life goes a lot smoother when you have your health, and we hope this book will help you in that regard. We also hope it will help you recognize it is possible to walk in balance even during times of dis-ease. \u2014Sun Bear 1 | The Mind Creatures Ninety percent of all illness begins in our heads. Ingrained negative thought patterns, many of them left over from our childhoods, help create illness if we hold on to them. I even know native medicine men whose illnesses resulted from internalized anger patterns for which they had no release. Two of these medicine men died of cancer. One let the anger eat away at him until he got stomach cancer. The other kept it in his head until he got brain cancer. Sadness, fear, depression, or plain grouchiness can do the same thing. By the time an illness has become a firm physical reality, tracing and reversing the original negative energy patterns may be quite challenging, and very time consuming. It could even take more time than a person may have left. Consequently, prevention is an important thing for you to understand. You can experience life as a beautiful dance if you learn to become a spiritual warrior\u2014a person capable of defending your own destiny. Defending your destiny is your given right and your responsibility. In order to be a spiritual warrior you must begin by cleaning up your own act, ridding yourself of the things that cause you pain and frustration. You need either to digest or disgorge the things that are eating at you, no matter how long they've been doing so. Preventive care on all levels of being is mandatory to well-being. There is truth to the adage, It is not what you eat but what eats you. It is the deep-down gut-level things that make you feel unhappy, that give you a sense of anger, turmoil, sadness, helplessness, or frustration in your life that eventually can give you problems. These emotions literally take power over you. I call these patterns mind creatures because they actually like to get inside your head and eat at you. Don't despair! Everybody has mind creatures and there are viable tools to help free you from these negative chains of thought and emotion. It is your choice whether or not to utilize these tools. Only you can take charge of your life and integrate new information and habits that can break these chains. This can be a painful process, but, with perseverance, joy can follow. The first step is to recognize your patterns of thought and feeling. If thinking of your ex-husband, ex-wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, mother, father, or coworker makes you hot with anger, lust, or another strong emotion, you may be experiencing a negative emotional bond that could become a mind creature. Job-related worries, concerns over debt, a negative situation you've experienced, or an unresolved traumatic childhood experience can also cause such bonds. Frequently we don't even realize we are bothered by something. I periodically take time to explore myself emotionally to see if I am holding on to any negativities. If you don't take time to check, these negative charges become buried in you. They burrow into your emotions encouraging internal dissension. They canal through your being in search of a discharge. On a spiritual plane, they sabotage your attempts to reinstate inner harmony. Such frustrations and pressures compound, increasing anxiety, resulting in physical tensions that create a virtual paradise for illness. Eventually dis-ease and physical illness may begin to surface. Imagine your stress level is like a long horizontal board nailed firmly to a sturdy crate at each end. This structure is basically strong and durable. However, if you place heavier and heavier weights on the center of the board eventually it will bend and then break under the pressure. Your resistance to stress and disease is like this board. You must carefully determine the amount of pressure and stress you can take before you bend too far and break down physically or emotionally. To do this it is necessary to realize how much the pressures in your life put you at risk. In the old days my people did not experience many of the stresses that are a part of contemporary life. Modern people recognize this on some level. A lot of you work hard your whole lives so you can retire to a house or a camper in the middle of the woods and spend your time fishing, gardening, taking care of the basics, and living a lot like the native people of old. People who want to live like the Indians have a good idea of what it takes to reduce stress. Living close to nature, taking time to see the trees and hear the birds, and taking care of life's essentials are all great stressbusting methods. I'll tell you more about them in later chapters. Saying that you can control your stress level and mind creatures is not saying that you control your destiny completely. Only the Great Spirit who is within and around all of life sees the whole of our universe. The whys and whats of our destiny are not even the central issues here. I want to emphasize that you should do the best you can with the control you have over your life and health. Clean up your past and lay a foundation for your future, so that you may live the most rewarding life possible in your present. DO YOU CREATE YOUR OWN REALITY? Today it is very popular to encourage people to believe they are totally responsible for absolutely everything that happens to them in their lives. Some people say you can create perfection and miracles through the power of thought alone. Creative manifestation is well and good for basically healthy people who can have a good job, "}
