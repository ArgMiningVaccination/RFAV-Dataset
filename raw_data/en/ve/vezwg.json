Sleeping pills are drugs that make you feel drowsy, helping with sleep. They are a temporary solution to [insomnia](https://mantracare.org/therapy/sleep/insomnia-types-causes-treatment/). While they make you feel tiresome, their effects wear off over time and therefore aren't a long-term solution. Doctors may prescribe them for this reason or because of another condition that is causing your [trouble sleeping](https://mantracare.org/therapy/sleep/trouble-sleeping/) such as [anxiety](https://mantracare.org/counseling/anxiety/) or [depression](https://mantracare.org/counseling/depression/). How do sleeping pills work? Sleeping pills work by suppressing activity in your central nervous system. This brings on a relaxed feeling and helps you fall asleep faster. Most people take sleeping pills before bedtime but some pills can also help with certain types of insomnia. They cause trouble to people in starting again after waking up during the [night](https://mantracare.org/therapy/eating-disorders/night-eating-disorder/) or early morning hours. How effective are sleeping pills? Sleeping pills are effective in helping people sleep. However, their effectiveness can vary between people. It depends on how often you use them and what the cause of your sleep issues is. Some doctors will prescribe them for a short time to see if they help you get more sleep, but this is not common since there are other ways to improve your sleep. Who might need sleeping pills? Some people can't sleep because of a sleep disorder, anxiety, or depression. But if you don't have any of those things then there are still other things that you can do before taking medication. Types Of Sleeping Pills There are different types of sleeping pills, but most of them work by slowing down your brain. This can help you relax and fall asleep. The two main types are: - Benzodiazepines - These medications include drugs such as Valium and [Xanax](https://mantracare.org/therapy/medication/xanax-for-panic-attack/). They work quickly to make you sleepy and have been around for a long time. However, they can be addictive if taken for a long time, and they also carry the risk of overdose. - Non-Benzodiazepine Hypnotics - These medications don't have the same risks as benzodiazepines, but they may not work as well for some people. Zopiclone (Imovane) is an example of this type of drug. Benefits Of Sleeping Pills - Can help you fall asleep faster: One of the main benefits of sleeping pills is that they can help you fall asleep faster. This means that if you're struggling to get to sleep, taking a pill before bed could be the answer for you. - May improve your overall sleep quality: Another benefit of sleeping pills is that they may improve your sleep quality.

This may be because the medication makes you feel sleepy, which could make it harder for you to focus on things like driving or operating machinery safely. - May not work as well after a few weeks: Another thing to watch out for is whether these medications are effective over time - some studies find they stop working altogether after taking them regularly for about two weeks at a time. If they do become less helpful, talk with your doctor if this would still be worth it in your situation. - Can cause dependency: The final issue we'll discuss here is whether sleep aids can lead to [addiction](https://mantracare.org/therapy/addiction/addiction-meaning/)or dependence.
