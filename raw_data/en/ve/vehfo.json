ADE has tied those needs to a strategic vision for the agency - equity for all students to achieve their full potential . This vision informs our mission to ensure that every student in Arizona has access to high- quality education, essential support services, and opportunities that allow them to succeed and thrive academically. The pandemic exacerbated long -standing inequities in Arizona's education system. ADE strategically plans to address such inequities by using available federal relief dollars to build capacity in state and local systems for the schools, students, and communities most impacted by the pandemic, and compleme nt and support local recovery efforts. The Department has made a series of critical investments with ESSER I and II funds to respond to the pandemic. Projects funded to date have met the following criteria: Support for students and communities most impacted by COVID -19 Expanding schools' access to evidence -based programs and trainings Addressing multiple factors that impact student academic success like social -emotional - wellbeing, educator workforce shortages and burnout, and family internet connectivity The ability to measure success and impact of investments The following strategies have been particularly effective: Addressing the impact of the digital divide on learning Educator professional development and resources for multiple modalities of learning Partnerships with universities and community- based organizations on timely initiatives Some examples of the above strategies in action include: Partnering with an internet service provider to increase internet speeds for low -income families Partnering with other state agencies, universities, and philanthropic organizations to provide virtual professional development opportunities and mental health support to educators statewide Funding community- based organizations to serve more families in high -need communities Additional details and examples of these projects are provided in- depth at the beginning of our plan. All have encompassed interventions to address the impacts of disrupted instructional time and shifts to learning environments. Many of these interventions may be extended into an additional year using ARP ESSER funds. ADE will use this plan developed with stakeholder feedback and data to bring additional focus to the work at -hand and ahead. Our goal is to accelerate academic success over the next several years through: 3 1. Enrichment and reinforcement to learning -- innovations in assessment; data systems and data sharing; high- quality afterschool, expanded day, and summer learning programs; increased access to extracurriculars and tutoring; digital access and literacy; educator recruitment and retention. 2. Mental, behavioral, and physical health support for students and educators -- professional development and trauma -informed training for educators; family engagement and resources; high- quality after school, expanded day, and summer learning programs; and increased access to specialized professionals in schools. 3. Student and family re -engagement and support for critical transition periods -- family engagement and resources, kindergarten readiness tools and resources; mentorship programs; strengthening credit recovery programs; support for school district and community outreach to disengaged youth; programs focused on high school and post -secondary readiness; and digital access and literacy. This state plan includes more details on our approach throughout the pandemic and plans moving forward. We consider this a living document, as the needs and priorities acr oss the state may evolve and shift based on the course of the pandemic and the road to recovery. We are grateful to our Arizona students, educators, families, and the broader education community for their resiliency during the pandemic. We look forward to their partnership in the months and years ahead with this historic opportunity to invest in education. 4 State Plan for the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund U.S. Department of Education Issued: April 21, 2021 OMB Number: 1810- 0754 Expiration Date: October 31, 2021 Paperwork Burden Statement According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number. The valid OMB control number for this information collection is 1810-0754. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The obligation to respond to this collection is required to obtain or retain benefit under Section 2001 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP Act).

It is particularly important that ARP ESSER funding will enable States and local educational agencies ( \"LEAs \"), and more directly schools, to support student s who have been most severely impacted by the COVID- 19 pandemic and are likely to have suffered the most because of longstanding inequities in our communities and schools that have been exacerbated by the COVID- 19 pandemic . The U.S. Department of Education ( \"Department \") is committed to working in partnership with States so that these unprecedented resources are quickly put to work to ensure students have sustained access to in -person instruction and that the resources are used to provide the e ffective support students need as they persist through and recover from the impacts of the COVID- 19 pandemic. The thoughtful and timely use of these funds will have a lasting impact on our Nation's schools and help to address the inequities in resources, services, and opportunities available to our students. This template presents an opportunity for States to share their plans for the use of ARP ESSER funds with the public. The Department must approve a State educational agency's (\"SEA's \") plan in order to make the State's remaining ARP ESSER allocation available for use. Please note that the Department intends to issue ARP ESSER reporting requirements separately. Instructions Each SEA must provide descriptions and other information that address each requirement listed below. An SEA may use this template or another format as long as every item and element is addressed in the SEA's response . Throughout this document, questions that refer to an SEA's ARP ESSER funding are referencing the total allocation to be received by the SEA , including that which it allocates to its LEAs. Each SEA must submit to the Department by June 7, 2021, either: (1) its ARP ESSER plan or (2) the S tate requirements that preclude submission of the plan by that date and a date by which it will be able to submit its complete ARP ESSER plan. To submit the SEA's plan , please email the plan to y our Program Officer at [State] .OESE @ed.gov (e.g., Alabama.OESE@ed.gov ). In order to ensure transparency, the Department will post each plan on the Department's website when it is received and will indicate each p lan's approval status .

Describing the State's Current Status and Needs The Department recognizes the extraordinary efforts made by States, LEAs, and educators to support students during the COVID -19 pandemic. In this section, SEAs will describe the progress they have made, the priorities and student needs guiding their ARP ES SER funding decisions, and their current and projected operating status. 1. Progress and Promising Practices : Provide your assessment of the top 2- 3 strategies that have been most effective in supporting the needs of students in your State during the COVID -19 pandemic, especially for students most impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Please include, if applicable, how your State will submit and encourage its LEAs to submit lessons learned and best practices to the Department's Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse so that they can be shared with other States and LEAs. The following strategies led by the Arizona Department of Education (ADE) and partner organizations were particularly effective in supporting the needs of students in Arizona, especially those most impacted by COVID -19: Addressing the impact of the digital divide on learning The digital divide was a particular challenge in Arizona, given its diverse geographical landscape and the location of several school communities in remote areas. Nonetheless, ADE was able to take some immediate action steps including collaborating with: Cox Communications (a prevalent provider in AZ) to permanently double the speed of Cox's Connect2Compete internet service, a critical increase in speed for this plan available to low -income families. The Arizona Rural Schools' Association and the Arizona County Superintendents' Association by providing $1.5M in ESSER funds to fund a \"final mile project \", which will bring reliable, high -speed internet access to six rural Arizona communities by extending existing broadband capacity at schools and libraries (via E -rate) to students' homes. This is designed to be a proof of concept for scaling across the state with other available resources . Education Superhighway , a national non- profit, to enter into a data sharing agreement to leverage statewide data to identify the availability of ISP provider s to support procurement efforts by LEAs and to help families take advantage of other federal programs for affordable broadband. In addition, Superintendent Hoffman and a member of the State Board of Education convened a Tech nology Task Force to examine immediate and long - term needs to support digital access and literacy for education. Recommendations and resources from the Task Force are informing the use of 8 ESSER funds , agency budget and staffing, as well as being shared with other government agencies working on issues of digital acc ess. Educator professional development and resources for multiple modalities of learning ADE took several immediate steps to support educators and service organizations grappling with the shift to distance learning, and then adapting to a hybrid model during the pandemic. The par ticipation rates demonstrated the need across for this type of easily accessible resource offered at the state- level. Social Emotional Learning: Trauma -Sensitive Training and Support for Schools: free professional learning opportunities for educators to implement trauma -informed methods and new SEL competencies into their classrooms starting in the Summer of 2020 and through SY 2020- 2021 Arizona Virtual Teacher Institute (AVTI) : provided opportunities for all educators and childcare providers free, on-demand professional learning to advance digital teaching and learning skills. LEAs also had the option to leverage AVTI for customized trainings for their staff. Over 11, 700 teachers from over 1100 unique school districts have participated in these professional learning opportunities as of July 2021. College Access Professional (CAP) t raining ADE staff to facilitate virtual/hybrid training for teachers on how to play a role in advising students and increas ing postsecondary attainment throughout Arizona, with a focus on low -income and underserved populations. Partnerships with universities and community -based organizations These entities have played a key role in addressing immediate and on- going needs of the pandemic. For example: University of Arizona's Center for Recruitment & Retention of Math Teachers (CRR) has worked with ADE on the goal of e nsuring all K-12 math educators, including those in special education, have access to the resources, supports, and professional learning opportunities offered by the CRR statewide at no cost. YMCA and Arizona Alliance of Boys & Girls Club collaborated with ADE and the Governor's Office at the height of the pandemic to provide capacity to support onsite services for students who needed a safe place to go when schools only offered distance learning during the SY 2020- 2021. These partners provided youth access to technology , adult supervision, and support with online learning platforms, as well as childcare and extended day opportunities for essential workers to accommodate workforce hours. 9 ADE has several other projects and services through partnerships available during summer 2021 and next school year. ADE is also partnering with the Arizona Department of Economic Security to utilize $95.7M in supplemental ARP funds to the Child Care Development Fund to 1) accelerate early childhood literacy , including launching literacy coaches ; 2) provide preschool development grants for LEAs and other providers ; 3) expand the Dolly Parton Imagination Library Program ; and 4) support cross- sector strategic planning, data integra tion, and fiscal mapping to address early childhood capacity gaps across Arizona. This will be an important collaboration among partners and supplement to our strategies and investments through ARP ESSER. ADE will submit, and encourage its LEAs to submit, lessons learned and be st practices to the ED's Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse so that they can be shared with other States and LEAs. 2. Overall Priorities : Provide your assessment of the top 2- 3 issues currently facing students and schools across your S tate as a result of or in response to the COVID- 19 pandemic including, to the extent possible, data illustrating why these are the most critical and/or most widespread issues facing schools and students. ADE will use this ARP ESSER plan developed with stakeholder feedback and data to bring additional focus to the work at -hand and ahead. Our goal is to accelerate academic success over the next several years though the following priority areas : 1. Enrichment and reinforcement to learning 2. Mental, behavioral, and physical health support for students and educators 3. Student and family re -engagement and supp ort for critical academic transition periods These priorities will help ADE address key pressing issues currently facing students and schools across the state, including: Assessing learning loss and measuring and evaluating progress: Schools need guidance on how best to assess the impact of learning loss of students, selecting and using universal screening tools, diagnostic assessments, and other data sources to identify learning gaps. This would include how to analyze these local assessment data to support instructional decision- making and how to measure and evaluate the impact of evidence- based strategies, programs, and practices on student learning over time. 10 Equitably increasing learning opportunities and digital access : The pandemic revealed long -standing inequities in learning opportunities - particularly for Arizona's historically underserved and most vulnerable student populations. There is a critical need to support the intentional selection and implementation of evid ence- based strategies and resources to support schools equitably and sustainably, accelerate learning and increase learning opportunities for students. Across the state, students' uneven engagement in distance and online learning exacerbated absenteeism an d learning gaps due to lost instructional time. Given this, there is a need to continue to address the digital divide and homework gap - particularly concerning access to reliable, high- speed internet for students at home and supporting teachers on how to integrate the use of technology in their teaching effectively. Addressing disruption and t rauma on s tudent learning and d evelopment : Support that may have previously been in place was either limited or ended due to schools' inability to effectively deliver these services when closed for in- person learning or operating in hybrid models. Furthermore, the pandemic brought new grief, loss, and trauma, potentially including increased risk for violence and abuse in the home. Given this, there will continue to be a need to provide targeted, evidence -based strategies to support students, staff, and families' well- being and mental health needs. T here is also a need for ongoing professional learning, resources, and support for teachers to integrate Social - Emotional Learning competencies into their daily classroom routines and practices and trauma- sensitive approaches using frameworks. Data and information throughout this plan illustrate why these are priorities to address critical and widespread issues facing Arizona's schools and students. 3. Identifying Needs of Underserved Students : Describe your State's 2-3 highest priority academic, social, emotional, and/or mental health needs for the remainder of the 2020- 2021 school year (if applicable) and for the 2021- 2022 school year related to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on each of the following student groups : i. Students from low -income families, ii. Students from each racial or ethnic group (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by race or ethnicity ), iii. Gender (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by gender) , iv. English learners, v. Children with disabilities (including infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities eligible under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( \"IDEA\" )), vi. Students experiencing homelessness, vii. Children and youth in foster care , 11 viii. Migratory students , and ix. Other groups disproportionately impacted by the pandemic that have been identified by the SEA (e.g., youth involved in the criminal justice system, students who have missed the most in- person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 school years, students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures , and LGBTQ + students ). To the extent possible, this description should include data on indicators such as estimates of the academic imp act of lost instructional time ,1 chronic absenteeism, student engagement , and social -emotional well- being. Complete the table below , adding rows as necessary, or provide a narrative description. Table A1. Student group Highest priority needs Students from low - income families Studies show that students will have lost up to 30 percent of their annual gain in reading and 50 percent in math because of the disruption to in- person learning. Overall, students, on average, are predicted to have missed 6.8 months of learning. Black and Hispanic students are predicted to have missed between 9 -11 months of learning (Migration Policy Institute, 2020). There will be a need for schools statewide to assess the impact of learning to be intentional and targeted in meeting students' needs and accelerating learning. Students who have been identified as Black, Hispanic, or Native American may also be students who come from low -income families. These students faced some of the most significant barriers with inter net connectivity, accessing school supplies and materials, and receiving social and emotional/health services during distance learning. Kindergarten enrollment dropped from 81,606 in SY20 to 72,960 in SY21, a decrease of 10.59%. Kindergarten students from low -income families make up a high percentage of these numbers. These students have missed opportunities for learning foundational skill s in reading and math, developing proficiency in social and academic language, and developing social and emotional skills that are critical in a learner's early years in school. They will need to be prioritized as they move into their next year of schooling. For most students, educators, staff, and school administrators, COVID -19 raised concerns related to danger, safety, and the need for protection. For some, these concerns added to pre -existing trauma, adversity, and disparities. And for others, the pandemic brought new grief, uncertainty, and trauma. These concerns were added barriers for students from low -income families, exacerbating the challenges historically faced related to economic hardship and unmet basic needs. 1 For the purposes of the plan, \"academic impact of lost instructional time \" refers to \"learning loss\" experienced by students as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, as referenced in the ARP Act and the CRRSA Act . 12 Student group Highest priority needs Students from ea ch racial or ethnic background used by the State for reporting purposes - please add a row for each racial or ethnic group (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by race/ethnicit y) Historically , underserved students from Arizona's racial and ethnic groups have been disproportionately represented in Arizona's data on chronic absenteeism. These students have missed much -needed instructional time , opportunities to access any desired or necessary social, emotional, and mental health services. The following table indicates data for chronically absent students in Arizona for SY2018- 2019 and SY2019- 2020, disaggregated by student population. Please note that SY2019- 2020 indicates fewer chronically absent students , due to data reporting challenges schools faced after the COVID- 19 National Emergency was declared on March 13, 2020. All Students Total Number of Students Chronically Absent Total Number of Students Enrolled Total Percentage of Students Chronically Absent one third of Arizona students continue to face barriers engaging in school due to limited or no access to technology and connectivity. Half of these students are Black or Hispanic/Latino , per Closing the K -12 Digital Divide In The Age of Distance Learning , a report from July 2020 developed by Boston Consulting Group in partnership with Common Sense Media . Arizona's Native American students, living in 22 Federally recognized tribal nations, were acutely impacted by the pandemic. Analysis of data regarding statewide percent households without internet and percent households without a computer from the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) noted that Native American students had limited or no a ccess to technology or internet connectivity to support online instruction. Many students received instruction throughout the year through learning packets . These students also experienced some of the nation's highest mortality rates for COVID -19 - leading to generations of families being lost to the pandemic. Arizona's Latino students make up the largest portion of the State's public education system . Many of the issues facing Arizona's public schools are reflective of issues impacting Latino students and the broader community. The 2020 report, The Impact of COVID -19 on Latino 13 Student group Highest priority needs Families , by the Arizona non -profit All in Education , reported data from a survey and poll that reached 200 families noted that the top five concerns during the pandemic were 1) lack of communication in English and Spanish, 2) technology issues (devices and reliable i nternet), 3) parents' lack of tools to support at home learning, 4) economic challenges, and 5) populations at risk of falling behind (e.g. SPED, English Learners). As a result of missed time in school, trauma experienced due to the impact of COVID- 19, and limited access to the internet, Latino, Black, and Native American student's opportunities for learning and social -emotional well- being have been impacted significantly. Students by gender - please add a row for each gender (e.g., identifyi ng disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by gender) Arizona's data on chronic absenteeism, shows that male students are more likely to be chronically absent within underserved student groups than female student. Note that SY2019- 2020 indicates fewer chronically absent students, because of the data reporting challenges schools faced after the COVID -19 National Emergency was declared on March 13, 2020. Male Students Total Number of Students Chronically Absent Total Number of Students Enrolled Total Percentage of Students Chronically Absent Students Total Number of Students Chronically Absent Total Number of Students Enrolled Total Percentage of Students Chronically Absent *Disaggregated data for students experiencing homelessness are not available at the time of this reporting English learners Arizona currently serves approximately 86,000 English Learner (EL) students who are participating in an EL Program. Of that number, 78% are continuing in an EL Program from SY2019- 2020. 19,000 were new to an EL Program in SY2020- 2021. Of those students, 60 % were incoming Kindergarten students. 2% of current students with an EL need and were in an EL program in SY 2019- 2020 were not in an EL program in SY2020- 2021. These students will need to be identified, assessed, and monitored for progress. Kindergarten English Learner students will also need to be prioritized as they move into their next year of schooling because of their unique social, emotional, and academic needs coupled with a high rate of chronic absenteeism. Children with disabilities Academic impact of lost instructional time and changed instructional environments : In SY 2021- 2022, baseline and progress monitoring assessment of students with disabilities (SWD) will be critical to understanding the impact of lost instructional time and changed instructional environments (i.e., virtual vs. in- person) due to COVID -19 ba rriers during SY 2020- 2021. Although students with disabilities were eligible to receive instruction and special education services via targeted onsite programs during SY 2020- 2021 under Executive Order 2020- 51, many parents of SWD declined to allow in- person instruction and services for SWD for medical, safety, transportation, or other reasons. If an SWD could not access all services effectively via virtual or hybrid settings, the full benefit of free appropriate public education (FAPE) may not have been p ossible. Additionally, while the need for Compensatory Services must be individually assessed and made available for students in this situation, providing these services now may not wholly compensate for lost time and services. Ongoing formal and informal assessments must be undertaken, and the results incorporated into the IEPs of SWD and their individual courses of study. Increased student engagement, representation, and expression: During SY 2020- 2021, many students were allowed to participate in virtua l or hybrid instructional models to support safety while still receiving educational services. All students need increased opportunities for multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression. Still, they are critical for SWD, who require individualized accommodations or modifications to access the curriculum (especially considering the instructional model) to participate and make progress fully. Supporting Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles for students throughout all learning modalit ies continues to be a research -based framework for improving academic and interpersonal student achievement for all students, including SWD. Building on the incorporation of technology and multiple means 15 Student group Highest priority needs of engagement, representation, and expression that g rew exponentially out of necessity during SY 2020- 2021, a focus on UDL principles for optimizing teaching and learning during SY 2021- 2022 will assist SWD in continuing to access the general curriculum fully. It will ensure accommodations and modifications represent meaningful additional individualized support instead of simply lifelines for academic participation. Students experiencin g homelessnes s Students experiencing homelessness have been disproportionately represented in Arizona's data on chronic absenteeism. In SY2019- 2020, on average 58.76% of students experiencing homeless were considered chronically absent. All Students Total Number of Students Chronically Absent Total Number of Students Enrolled Total Percentage of Students Chronically Absent experiencing homelessness were not only among those students least likely to have access to a device at home or consistent access to internet service but also may have had limited access to free meals and any materials, resources, or supplies needed for learning. These challenges have impacted their ability to engage in distance or online learning successfully. As a result of missed time engaging in school, learning loss, and opportunities to have their individual social and emotional needs met, these stude nts have been significantly impacted. They will need to be prioritized for services traditionally provided in and during the school day and much-needed services provided outside of the school day. Children and youth in foster care Students in foster care and group homes struggled with distance learning due to limited access to technology, on- site support, and needed materials and supplies, per feedback provided by the foster care community, including the Arizona Department of Child Services (DCS) Director . Children and youth in foster care in rural Arizona may have been even more impacted than their urban counterparts. Given these challenges, foster students will need targeted supports to address learning loss. These targeted interventions could include focused tutoring and afterschool services, with an additional focus on early reading proficiency, math skills in middle school, and credit recovery acceleration programs for high school students. According to Arizona's Department of Child Safety (DCS) Director, students in foster care/group homes struggled with distance learning in SY20- 21 due to limited access to technology, on- site support and needed materials and supplies to support their engagement in school. LEAs were required to provide on- site supports for youth that needed assistance in accessing and participating in remote learnin g per an Executive Order. However, many LEAs were challenged with providing consistent on-site support due to the high rates of COVID- 19 cases in their area. 16 Student group Highest priority needs Additionally, students in foster care and group homes also faced a high degree of isolation during the COVID -19 pandemic. Important social and emotional support systems and resilience building activities ceased or continued virtually during the COVID -19 pandemic. Students will have also missed opportunitie s to develop routines, learn systems and processes that are in place and followed when attending school in person. These challenges may be more acute with students returning during a transition point - such as moving from a middle school to high school set ting. Recent d ata from the Casey Family Programs, 2021 show that that 91% of students enter foster care due to neglect and other factors, such as includes parental substance abuse, child substance abuse, child disability, child behavior problems, parent death, parent incarceration, caretaker inability to cope, relinquishment or inadequate housing. Considering the se data, some foster care students will not only have missed opportunities for learning, but also social and emotional, behavioral and mental health services and/or supports that are more readily provided during in- person learning. Students will require supports regarding how to engage appropriately in a more tradit ional classroom environment. Teachers will also require professional learning support to positively address potential behavior challenges that may result from students returning to more structured learning environments . Absent these supports, there may be increases in detention, suspensions and expulsions for children and youth in foster care as they return to in- person instruction. Migra tory students Arizona currently serves over 11,451 migratory students. Almost half (5177) of our state's migrant students have been identified as Priority for Service . These students are failing or at risk of failing. 3767 students have been identified as dual labeled students, Migrant and EL. Many of Arizona's migratory students live in rural communities. These communities faced the greatest barriers in internet connectivity , accessing free meals, and school supplies and materials . Families of m igratory students also struggled to find employment during the pandemic due to the nature of their work. Limited opportunit ies for work contributed to unstable living conditions and placed a significant social -emotional burden on students and their families. Systems and processes that ensure s ervices that migratory families and students have a right to receive, must be re- established and provided in SY2021- 2022. Other groups of students identified by the State (e.g., youth involved in the criminal Children and youth being served by juvenile detention education programs and services already have unique academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs. The impact of the pandemic further exacerbated these needs. ADE received feedback from the juvenile detention education community (including representatives from the Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections, county- operated juvenile detention education programs and c ounty school superintendents, and ADE Secure Care staff) on the following priority needs for these students: 17 Student group Highest priority needs justice system, students who have missed the most in - person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 school years, students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures , LGBTQ + students ) Given the impact of the trauma of the past year on existing challenges, there will be a need to provide evidence -based strategies to support the social, emotional, and mental health shown to be effective with these students, mainly through a trauma -informed instruction lens. There will further be a need to provide additional targeted academic interventions that are individualized and focused on mee ting students' unique needs using a personalized learning approach. Students served by juvenile detention education programs often present significant academic gaps unique to each child. These gaps were widened by the impact of the pandemic, as the ability to provide in -person instruction was limited and varied depending on the detention facility. Given this, the need to provide targeted, evidence -based interventions individualized based on each child's unique needs through a personalized learning approach will be critical to help address these learning gaps. There are fu rther needs to ensure intentional and consistent transition supports for students after being released from detention education and secure care programs. Without intentional supports and resources, students may go back to prior unhealthy environments post -release, which may not be positive and contribute to recidivism. Strengthening partnerships with the judicial system, schools, community- based organizations, and employers will help build relationships and bridges for students to successfully transition to traditional public -school programs. Mentorships, post-secondary access, job training, and job placement are also critical for vulnerable student populations. 4. Understanding the Impact of the COVID -19 Pandemic : Describe how the SEA will support its LEAs in identifying the extent of the impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on student learning and student well -being, including identifying the groups of students most impacted by the pandemic. Where possible, please identify the data sources the SEA will suggest its LEAs use in thoughtfully diagnosing areas of need, including data on the academic, social, emotional, and mental health impacts of lost instructional time . Schools are required to complete the Arizona Comprehensive Needs Assessment ( CNA) annually. The process is designed to provide schools the necessary data to identify primary needs, root causes, desired outcomes, goals, strategies, and action steps resulting in an Integrated Action Plan. The CNA reflects the school's current state. It identifies strengths, needs, and desired outcomes specific to individual schools and their context. The six areas the CNA looks at are Effective Leadership, Effective Teachers and Instruction, Effective Use of Time, Effective Curriculum, Conditions, Climate, and Family and Community Engagement. 18 LEAs throughout Arizona currently use a variety of benchmark or interim assessments to determine progress towards standards mastery. Other student learning data come from screening, diagnostic assessments, classroom assessments, activities, and formative assessments. Offering professional learning around using multiple data points to inform instruction to close learning gaps such as processes from Bambrick- Santoyo, Driven by Data, as well as protocols and proce sses such as Lipton and Wellman's, Data- Driven Dialogue; ATLAS, Looking at Data (National School Reform Faculty); etc. will be important. Gathering social, emotional, and mental well- being data is more problematic. Some LEAs in AZ currently participate in Panorama Education's Supporting Student Success surveys and analytics to collect reliable data to understand students, families, and staff better. Student data are collected directly from students through surveys. These LEAs will be able to assess and t ake action by using t hese data. Other LEAs may want to use ESSER funds to participate in this resource. Panorama provides support for analyzing and using these data. FastBridge Assessment System from Illuminate Solutions is one of the assessment system s used by Arizona schools. In addition to ELA and Math assessments, they also have The Social, Academic, and Behavior Risk Screener (SAEBRS). It provides a clear link to the Arizona (CASEL) SEL Competencies and the behavioral manifestations. A brief teacher rating scale identifies students K -12 who may be at risk for social -emotional challenges and can be used as a universal screener. Another high- quality SEL assessment is The Devereux Student Strengths Assessment and the 4 -item accompanying screener. Th e DESSA -Mini are rating scales for K -8 mapped directly to SEL skills. Without assessment resources in all schools, it will be necessary to support schools and LEAs to embed SEL throughout their back to school planning through two way communication with staff, students, families and community parents; staff community building , to reconnect and attend to adults SEL needs; provide professional learning to promote SEL, building solid relationships with students and creating a safe, supportive learning environment; supportive learning environment, building community, listening to students ideas and concerns; integrating SEL competencies throughout the school day, schoolwide, identifying ways all teachers help students enhance and practice competencies through distance learning and in- person settings, either through evidence- based programs, regular class meetings, group and individual check- ins, or instructional practices that allow for reflection, discussion, and collaboration; and student support, addressing tier I, II and III supports and protocols to identify students' needs as w ell partner with families and community agencies to proactively identify, provide, and monitor additional 19 supports to students who are struggling socially, emotionally, behaviorally, or academically. Specific to youth mental health Arizona will provide information following guidelines and recommendations of such organizations as the National Alliance for Mental Health, Association for Children's Mental Health, Youth Mental Health First aid, Mental Health Technology Transfer Center Network, National Cent er on Safe and Supportive Schools and the National Training and Technical Assistance Center. Currently, Arizona provides Project AWARE. The goals of Project AWARE are to build and expand capacity at state and local levels to improve access to mental health services and supports; to conduct outreach and training to increase mental health literacy; and reduce stigma and connect youth, families, and school staff to mental health services. ADE also provides Youth mental Health First Aid Training to educators and online QPR Suicide Prevention Training. 5. School Operating Status : It is essential to have data on how students are learning in order to support the goals of access and equity, especially for student groups that have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Des cribe the current status of data collection on operational status and mode of instruction of all schools in your State . This description must include: i. A description of to what extent, and how frequently, the State collects now and will collect in the future data for all schools in your State on: a. Mode of instruction: The number of schools in your State that are offering fully remote or online -only instruction; both remote/online and in- person instruction (hybrid model); and/or full-time in -person instruction; b. Enrollment: Student enrollment for all students and disaggre gated for each of the student groups described in A .3.i- viii for each mode of instruction; and c. Attendance: Student attendance for all students and disaggregated for each of the student groups described in A .3.i- viii for each mode of instruction . In SY 2020 -2021, Arizona LEAs were required to report the percentage of instructional time that was remote or online , but only at the LEA -level. Arizona has provided data as of Mid- May 2021 for SY 2020- 2021 for School Operating Status and Instructional M ode in Appendix A, Table 1. Data are provided for all schools, elementary schools (schools serving primarily grades K-8) and secondary schools (schools serving primarily grades 9- 12). These tables assume that the percentage of instruction that was remote o r online only was the same for all schools within the LEA, except or schools approved to 20 provide Arizona Online Instruction, which is entirely online. Unredacted data from the SY2020- 2021 October 1st Enrollment Report was used to make school primary grade levels served determination for the purposes of this reporting. Starting in SY2021- 2022, School Operating Status and Instructional Mode data will be collected at the student level via the Arizona Education Data Standards (AzEDS) process. AzEDS is the vehicle for ADE to collect all student- level data from LEAs for school finance and state and federal reporting. Leveraging AzEDS will allow for ADE to collect and report disaggregated student -level data reporting per the ongoing reporting requirem ents of Appendix A, Table 2 of the ARP ESSER State Plan Template , to include Mode of Instruction, Enrollment and Attendance for all students and disaggregated for each of the student groups described in A.3.i -viii for each mode of instruction (fully remote or online -only instruction; both remote/online and in- person instruction (hybrid full -time in -person instruction) . SY2020- 2021 State Policy Actions Regarding Modes of Instruction June 24, 2020, Governor Ducey issued EO -2020- 41, which allowed school to offer distance learning instruction outside of an approved online school model. This required all sc hools to submit a distance learning plan and identify ways to submit attendance for students in distance learning. June 29, 2020, Governor Ducey issued EO -2020- 44 requiring all schools to delay in-person classes until Augus t 17, 2020, while beginning distance learning as no later than August 14, 2020. July 23, 2020, Governor Ducey issued EO -2020- 51 requiring all schools, beginning August 17, 2020 , to offer free onsite learning opportunities and support services for students who needed a place to go during the day. School districts or charters that were experiencing an outbreak or w ere impacted by the stay-at-home orders of tribal sovereign nations could apply for a waiver from the requirement to provide onsite services. March 3, 2021 , Governor Ducey issued EO -2021- 04 requiring all district and charter schools to return to in- person, teacher -led instruction following a scheduled spring break or by March 15, 2021. There was an exception for counties with substantial or high transmission to take measures to reduce or stagger attendance for in -person learning. Schools were not, however, prohibited from offering parents the choice for hybrid or remote instruction. ii. The data described in A. 5.i.a. and b. using the template in Appendix A (and to the extent available, the data described in A.5. i.c.) for the 21 most recent time period available. Please note that this data can be submitted separately within 14 calendar days after a State submits this plan. The SEA must also make this data publicly available on its website as soon as possible but no later than June 21, 2021, and regularl y provide updated available information on its website. The Department will periodically review data listed in A.5.i on SEA websites . School Operating Status and Instructional Mode Data Data are reported as of Mid -May 2021 for SY 2020- 2021 Table 1 : All Schools Number of schools All schools Offered to all students Offered to some students Not offered Remote or online only 498 498 0 1647 School buildings open with both remote/online and in- person instruction (hybrid) 1592 1592 0 553 School buildings open with full-time in -person instruction 55 55 0 2090 Elementary Schools (Schools serving primarily K -8) Number of schools All schools Offered to all students Offered to some students Not offered Remote or online only 315 315 0 1234 School buildings open with both remote/online and in- person instruction (hybrid) 1200 1200 0 349 School buildings open with full-time in -person instruction 34 34 0 1515 22 Secondary Schools (Schools serving primarily 9 -12) Number of schools All schools Offered to all students Offered to some students Not offered Remote or online only 183 183 0 413 School buildings open with both remote/online and in- person instruction (hybrid) 392 392 0 204 School buildings open with full-time in-person instruction 21 21 0 575 The ARP ESSER - SY2020- 2021 School Operating Status and Instructional Mode Data were posted on the ADE ARP ESSER website on June 21, 2021. iii. To the extent available, a des cription of the planned operational status and mode of instruction for the State and its LEAs for Summer 2021 and for the 2021- 2022 school year. The data reported under Appendix A: School Operating Status and Instructional Mode are reflective of Mid -May 2021 and represent the general operation status for schools as of the end of the SY 2020- 2021 school , and likely well- represents the projected status for schools entering Summer 2021. Our general expectation is that schools will return to in- person instruction for the SY 2021- 2022. LEAs may be able to offer hybrid or online learning modalities based on local needs if they meet state requirements to offer online instruction through an approved Arizona Online Instruction (AOI) entity within the LEA, or through flexibility offered through H.B. 2898 passed during the Spring 2021 legislative session (see below). The Governor's Executive orders related to the COVID -19 pandemic terminated on June 30, 2021. Therefore, schools are not afforded the same flexibilities for mode of instruction as available during the 2020 -2021 school year. During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Arizona Legislature passed H.B. 2862 (Laws 2021, Chapter 299) as amended by H.B. 2898. H.B. 2862 allows school districts and charter districts to adopt an Instructional Time Model (ITM) to meet the instructional hour requirements in A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 15- 808 and 15- 901 which provides flexibility for a school district or charter district to determine the way instructional hours are provided to students, including: remote courses, project -based learning, mastery -based learning, weekend courses, or evening courses. Before a school district adopts an ITM, the school 23 district must hold at least two public hearings. School dist ricts and charter schools intending to adopt an ITM must document how attendance will be tracked and taken for each setting in which a student is provided instructional time for auditing purposes. 24 B. Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining their Safe Operations The Department recognizes that safely reopening schools and sustaining their safe operations to maximize in -person instruction is essential for student learning and student well -being, and especially for being able to address the educational inequities that have been worsened by the COVID -19 pandemic . In this section, SEAs will describe how they will support their LEAs in this vital area. 1. Support for LEAs : Describe how the SEA will support its LEAs in safely returning to in- person instruction and sustaining the safe operation of schools . This description must include : i. How the SEA will support its LEAs implementing , to the greatest extent practicable, prevention and mitigation policies in line with the most up- to-date guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\" ) for the reopening and operation of school facilities to effectively maintain the health and safety of students, educato rs, and other staff ; Complete the table below, adding rows as necessary, or provide a narrative description. Table B1. Mitigation strategy SEA response Universal and correct wearing of masks See narrative response below Physical distancing (e.g., including use of cohorts/podding) See narrative response below Handwashing and respiratory etiquette See narrative response below Cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities, including improving ventilation See narrative response below Contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine, in collaboration with the State, local, territorial, or Tribal health departments See narrative response below Diagnostic and screening testing See narrative response below Efforts to provide vaccinations to educators, other staff, and students, if eligible See narrative response below Appropriate accommodations for children with disabil ities with respect to the health and safety policies See narrative response below ADE has collaborated with the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS), as well as County Health Departments to support schools in implementing strategies consistent with CDC recommended mitigation strategies to support schools and ensure the safety of students, families and staff throughout the COVID -19 pandemic. This collaboration has included coordinated messaging and communications for schools and the community regarding CDC safety guidelines and recommendations (to include testing and vaccination efforts ) as well as navigating Arizona's Executive Orders regarding distance learning, requiring 25 onsite services, the use of face coverings and reopening schools for in -person learning. ADE, ADHS and County Health Departments have also collaborated regarding how best to coordinate and leverage federal recovery resources that may be available across each agency, and by schools (such as through each of the ESSER funds) to support effective, effi cient and sustained safe reopening of schools statewide. The intent is to identify gaps in support, and to also avoid potential duplication of effort as each agency works to support their stakeholders. ADE has also shared the CDC's operational strategy for schools and childcare facilities, as well as Volume 1 and 2 of ED's COVID -19 Handbooks and other key resources for schools on ADE's Strategies for Safe In -Person Learning for Elementary and Secondary Schools website. On April 19, 2021 , Governor Ducey issued an Executive Order rescinding a section of Executive Order 2020- 51, directing schools to require face masks, and Emergency Measure 2020- 04, issued by the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) outlining requirements for mask usage in schools. The Arizona Department of Education has encouraged local education agencies and families to continue to follow CDC guidance. On June 30, 2021, The Arizona State Legislature passed a budget (HB2898) with a provision that explicitly bans LEA's from mandating mask use on school campuses . The Arizona Department of Education continues to stress the importance of universal and correct use of masks and encourages LEA's to work with their school communities to e nsure consistent and correct usage of masks to the greatest extent possible. ii. Any Statewide plans, policies, estimated timelines, and specific milestones related to reopening and operation of school facilities , including any mechanisms the SEA will use to track, monitor, or enforce their implementation ; Regarding SY2020 -2021: In June 2020, ADE released a Roadmap for R eopening Schools that was developed in partnership with public health experts and stakeholders across the Arizona. It included specific considerations for leaders, teachers, students, and families regarding COVID mitigation. It also inc luded a Continuity of Operations Planning (COOP) Template . At the time of its release, however , there was no statewide policy or required benchmarks for reopening\u2014local policies varied regarding COVID and school reopening . 26 On March 3, 2021 the Arizona Governor issued Executive Order 2021- 04 Open for In -Person Learning. Per this order, schools were required to return to in- person learning by March 15, 2021, or after their scheduled Spring Break. Exceptions to this order were included for middle and high schools located in counties with \"high\" transmission of COVID -19, as defined by the CDC. Students were also given the option to continue to participate in distance learning if that was the choice of their parent or guardians. A ll LEA were required to submit an attestation that all schools within each LEA's jurisdiction were following the tenets of the executive order. Throughout SY 2020- 2021, all Arizona LEAs were required to report the percentage of instructional time that was remote or online only at the LEA -level through the submission of Distance Learning Plans. ADE provided guidance on this policy through its School Finance unit. Regarding SY2021- 2022: Starting in SY2021- 2022, School Operating Status and Instructional Mode data will be collected at the student level per th e ongoing reporting requirements of Appendix A, Table 2 of the ARP ESSER State Plan Template, to include Mode of Instruction, Enrollment and Attendance for all students and disaggregated for each of the student groups described in A.3.i -viii for each mode of instruction (fully remote or online -only instruction; both remote/online and in- person instruction (hybrid model); and/or full -time in -person instruction). ADE has created a Safe Return to In- Person Instruction and Continuity of Services LEA plan template to support LEAs receiving ARP ESSER funds to meet the requirements of ARP Sec. 2001( i) and ED's Interim Final Rule (IFR). ADE has also posted guidance and support materials to support LEAs with revising their local plans and has set the expectation for LEAs to submit their plan to ADE by their first day of the SY 2020- 2021 school year - with updates to be submitted at least every 6 months, or more often depending on updates in CDC guidance, through September 30, 2023. ADE will track the s ubmission of LEA plans to ensure and monitor the ongoing compliance with these requirements. iii. To what extent the SEA and its LEAs consult with Federal, State, and local health officials. This description should include, if available, whether the SEA and its LEAs have received support for screening testing from their State or local health department based on funding awarded by the CDC ; and The ADE has had regular collaborative meetings with both the Arizona Department of Health Services and County Health Departments. 27 This collaboration has included coordinated messaging and communications for schools and the community regarding CDC safety guidelines and recommendations (to include test ing and vaccination efforts ) as well as navigating Arizona's Executive Orders regarding distance learning, requiring onsite services, the use of face coverings and reopening schools for in- person learning. ADE, ADHS and County Health Departments have also collaborated regarding how best to coordinate and leverage existing and new federal recovery resources that may be available across each agency, and by schools (such as through each of the ESSER funds) to support effective, efficient and sustained safe reopening of schools statewide. The intent is to identify gaps in support, and to also avoid potential duplication of effort as each agency works to support their stakeholders. ADHS is furthe r leveraging nearly $215 million in American Rescue Plan funds from the CDC in partnership with ADE to support a statewide voluntary, free pooled testing program to \"detect, diagnose, trace and monitor COVID -19 and prevent its spread\" in Arizona K -12 schools . This voluntary program will help reduce the cost burden on LEAs to offer pooled testing as a CDC suggested mitigation strategy to support the safe reopening and continuous operations of their schools in SY2021- 2022. iv. Any guidance , professional learning, and technical assistance opportunities the SEA will make a vailable to its LEAs. ADE, ADHS and County Health Departments have collaborated on how best to coordinate communications, messaging and technical assistance resources to support the safe reopening and continuous operations of schools statewide. This has included coordinating on how to provide timely, focused supports for school leaders on how to implement recommended CDC mitigation strategies. ADE has also worked to amplify key information and resources for schools, particularly as changes in mitigation strategies have been anno unced based on changing conditions and contexts and updates in CDC guidance. This collaboration has included coordinated messaging and communications for schools and the community regarding testing and vaccination efforts as well as navigating Arizona's Executive Orders regarding distance learning, requiring onsite services, the use of face coverings and reopening schools for in- person learning. 28 2. Safe Return to In-Person Instruction and Continuity of Services Plans : Describe how the SEA will ensure that its LEAs that receive ARP ESSER funds meet the requir ements in section 2001(i) of the ARP Act and the requirements relating to the ARP ESSER funds published in the Federal Register and available to either: (a) within 30 days of receipt of the funds, develop and make publicly available on the LEA's website a plan for the safe return to in-person instr uction and continuity of services, or (b) have developed and made publicly available on the LEA's website such a plan that meets statutory requirements before the enactment of the ARP Act, including: i. How the SEA will ensure that each LEA plan includes , or will be modified to include, the extent to which it has adopted policies and a description of any such policies on each of the strategies listed in table B1 ; ii. How the SEA will ensure that each LEA plan describes how it will ensure continuity of services including but not limited to services to address the students' academic needs , and students' and staff social, emotional, mental health, and other needs, which m ay include student health and food services ; iii. How the SEA will ensure that the LEA periodically review s, no less frequently than every six months for the duration of the ARP ESSER grant period (i.e., through September 30, 2023) , 2 and revise s as appropriate, its plan, and how the SEA will ensure that the LEA seeks public input , and takes such input into account on (1) whether revisions are necessary and, if so, (2) the revisions to the plan; and iv. Describe, to the extent the SEA collects it, information about LEA implementation , to the greatest extent practicable, of each element of the most up- to-date CDC guidance listed in t able B1 and its LEAs' needs for support and technical assistance to implement strategies consistent , to the greatest extent practicable, with relevant CDC guidance . ADE has included a required assurance as part of the LEA ARP ESSER grant application that requires an LEA to assure compliance with ARP Sec. 2001(i) and ED's Interim Final Rule regarding the LEA Safe Return to In- Person Instruction and Continuity of Servic es Plan requirement. Additionally, ADE has created a standardized Safe Return to In- Person Instruction and Continuity of Services LEA plan template to support LEAs receiving ARP ESSER funds to meet this requirement. The template was designed to ensure compliance with all required local plan components of ED's Interim Final Rule, to include LEAs 2 ARP ESSER funds are subject to the Tydings amendment in section 421(b) of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U .S.C. 1225(b), and are therefore available to SEAs and LEAs for obligation through September 30, 2024. Review and revisions of these plans, if necessary, are not required during the Tydings period. 29 providing a description of the process used to gather, and consider , public input in the creation and revis ion of their local plan. ADE has posted guidance and support materials to support LEAs with revising their local plans on the agency's ARP ESSER website , and has set the expectation for LEAs to submi t their plan to ADE by their first day of the SY 2021- 2022 school year - with updates to be submitted at least every 6 months, or more often depending on updates in CDC guidance and changes in local contexts , through September 30, 2023 . ADE will track the submission of LEA plans to ensure and monitor the ongoing compliance with these requirements. ADE does not currently collect information regarding LEA implementation of CDC guidance but will do so moving forward with the SY2021- 2022 school year based on the implementation and monitoring of the ARP Safe Return to In- Person Instruction and Continuity of Services Plan requirements. 30 C. Planning for the Use and Coordination of ARP ESSER Funds The Department recognizes that seeking input from diverse stakeholder s is essential to developing plans for the use of ARP ESSER funds that are responsive to the needs of students, families, and educators. In this section, SEAs will describe their plans for consultation and for coordinating the use of ARP ESSER funds with other resources to meet the needs of students. 1. SEA Consultation: Consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements , describe how the SEA engaged in meaningful consultation with stakeholders, and incorporated input into its plan, including, but not limited to : i. students; ii. families; iii. Tribes (if applicable); iv. civil rights organizations ( including disability rights organizations ); v. school and district administrators (including special education administrators); vi. superintendents; vii. charter school leaders (if applicable); viii. teachers, principals, school leaders , other educators, school staff, and their unions; and ix. stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migr atory students, children who are incarcerated , and other underserved students . The description must include how the SEA provided the public the opportunity to provide input in the development of the plan , a summary of the input (including any letters of support) , and how the SEA took such input into account . Ongoing Stakeholder Engagement and Collaboration with Arizona's Education Community ADE utilized its standing meetings/processes with stakeholders to discuss ESSER set aside funds, including the particular focus areas designated by ARP for ARP ESSER . These meetings have included: ADE and Arizona Education Organizations Weekly Calls: These calls started shortly after the declaratio n of the national emergency for COVID -19 in March 2020. These weekly standing meetings helped to ensure coordinated communication and timely collaboration that informed local, regional, and statewide responses throughout the pandemic. Feedback was provided to inform communications, support, and technical assistance for schools and communities to help them navigate local relief and recovery efforts, public health guidelines, and Executive Orders from the Governor's Office. Representatives from the following education organizations have participated in these ongoing meetings: Arizona School Boards Association (ASBA), Arizona School Administrators (ASA), Arizona Association of School Business Officials (AASBO), Arizona Charter Schools Association (ACSA), Arizon a Association of County School 31 Superintendents (AACSS), Arizona Education Association (AEA) Arizona Rural Schools Association (ARSA), Greater Phoenix Education Management Council and Arizona Education Management Council (GPEMC/AEMC). ADE further partnered with the Arizona School Boards Association (ASBA), Arizona School Administrators (ASA), Arizona Association of School Business Officials (AASBO), and the Arizona Charter Schools Association (ACSA) to provide Collaborative Webinars to support ESSE R implementation. All ADE presentations to support the implementation of each major recovery act (CARES, CRRSA, ARP Acts) and each ESSER fund opportunity (I, II, and ARP ESSER) and related requirements have been done in concert with education organizations . This collaborative partnership has helped ensure clear and consistent communication across stakeholder groups and served to expand the reach of the agency's message. ADE also provided targeted communications and technical assistance in partnership with o rganizations such as the Arizona Rural Schools Association, County School Superintendents, the Greater Phoenix Education Management Council, Arizona Education Management Council, Tribal Leaders, Alternative Education Consortium, and Career and Technical Ed ucation Districts. Education Leaders Weekly Calls : ADE established weekly virtual meetings with education leaders statewide - to include Superintendents and other district and school -level leaders. This served as a vehicle to ensure clear, consistent comm unication of information, resources and guidance to support their schools to navigate the shift from online/distance learning to hybrid and face -to-face instruction and preparing for the safe reopening of schools throughout the SY 2020- 2021 school year. These weekly calls will continue into SY 2021- 2022 Superintendent's Advisory Councils are convened by the State Superintendent to inform the work of the agency . This existing capacity was leveraged to provide timely feedback regarding the impact of COVID -19 within specific communities, and how the agency could best respond to meet those needs. Each advisory council has a unique membership, although each council includes educators, as well as student representatives : o African American Advisory Council o Equitable and Inclusive Practices Advisory Council o Indian Education Advisory Council o Latinx Advisory Council o Student Advisory Council Monthly ADE Policy & Program up dates were held virtually with education organizations (including advocacy groups and non -profit service organizations), a s well as legislative and executive branch staff. Monthly ADE Office of Indian Education (OIE) Policy & Program Updates specifically targeted for Indigenous Stakeholders , including tribal education 32 department staff. OIE works statewide to support educational opportunities for Indigenous students attending Arizona's public schools. The capacity of this office was expanded using ESSER funds to further support the unique recovery needs of Indigenous families and their schools, especially given the outsized impact of COVID- 19 on t ribal communities. Equitable & Effective Schools Task Force ADE gathered research and community input via its Equitable and Effective School Funding Task Force to develop a set of recommendations on the distribution and prioritized use of SEA discretionary ARP ESSER funds . This task force had convened initially to work together throughout the fall semester of 2020 to identify critical needs and action steps to address the pandemic and ongoing recovery. The task force was reconvened in June 2021 to provide input on SEA discre tionary ARP ESSER fund allocation decisions. ADE expanded its membership to include a broader set of stakeholders for this purpose. Over 100 stakeholders, representing school district and charter leadership, philanthropy, the non- profit sector represen tative, early childhood practitioners and advocates, major education associations, special education advocacy groups, school board members, educators, and state agency leadership joined the reconvened task force meetings. ADE staff worked closely with c ontracted facilitators familiar with the education landscape in Arizona to hold two stakeholder meetings in June 2021. By leveraging task force member expertise, the agency: Gathered data on how LEAs are planning to address learning loss Built understandi ng of existing capacity and resource gaps in areas outlined by the ARP ESSER state -level discretionary funds Explored opportunities for innovation with one -time funding Identified systems -level policies and practices needed to support effective use of funds under ARP ESSER requirements and areas of focus Task force facilitators also solicited information on anticipated guidance and technical assistance needed from ADE to support the use of the funds, and how to monitor and evaluate effectiveness. The facilitators surveyed participants ahead of the first meeting on these topics. To inform the discussion, task force members were also provided information on ARP, research and policy briefs on learning loss, summer enrichment, afterschool programs, and promising pandemic responses from other states. Some initial themes from the pre -meeting survey include: Staffing programs is challenging right now Prioritize students who need the most Ensure quality programming for all Lack of infrastructure is still a barrier to access Increased demand means the work needs to grow fast 33 Promote quality programming and partnerships Flexibility is critical The facilitators also reached out to ADE's Student Advisory Council with similar survey questions about current conditions and what they would like to see. Themes from the student survey include: Support for mental health, including more access to counsel ors Return to physical health and movement, including sports, is important Students want academic tutoring A desire for more in- person experiences for vaccinated youth Schools need to support the return to school and foster a love of learning Teachers need supports so that schools can retain veteran teachers Student responses were shared with the task force and incorporated into the final recommendations. Themes and recommendations from Task Force Meeting #1 : *On impact and use of one-time funds dedicated to key ARP ESSER areas include : Social -Emotional Learning support Mental health and trauma- informed support for students and staff ; and Support for families, especially when students are at critical transitions in their academic career *On the f unding process: Desire for ADE to vet and fund a list of services available to LEAs Make available s tart-up/planning/exploratory funds Support LEAs with navigating evidence- based approaches Support partnership between LEAs and CBOs and/or universities Themes and recommendations from Task Force Meeting #2 : Prioritize student and adult social emotional learning, mental & physical health , K- 12 transitions, especially early education Focus on school, LEA, CBO, s tate-level capacity and overall strategies Data (including comprehensive data system), professional development, and assessments are resources that will be needed across priority areas to support work going forward. The input from stakeholders was used to develop the priorities outlined as part of this plan. It will also be used to guide ADE's process for determining state -driven interventions and investments, processes for distributing funds , and setti ng criteria for use of funds and data reporting and evaluation . 34 Stakeholder Groups How the SEA provided the public the opportunity to provide input in the development of the plan Students Superintendent's Student Advisory Council, ARP ESSER State Plan Student Survey Families Equitable and Effective Schools Taskforce Tribes Indian Education Advisory Council; Office of Indian Tribal Leaders in Education Convening Meetings Civil rights orga nizations (including disability rights organizations) Equitable and Effective Schools Taskforce; ADE Monthly Policy and Program Updates Meetings School and district administrators (including special education administrators); Equitable and Effective Schools Taskforce; Education Leaders Weekly Call; ADE and Education Organizations Weekly Call; ASA; GPEMC Superintendents Equitable and Effective Schools Taskforce; Education Leaders Weekly Call; ADE and Education Organizations Weekly Call; ASA; GPEMC Charter school leaders Equitable and Effective Schools Taskforce; Education Leaders Weekly Call; ADE and Education Organizations Weekly Call; ACSA Teachers, principals, school leaders, other educators, school staff, and their unions Equitable and Effectiv e Schools Taskforce; Education Leaders Weekly Call; ADE and Education Organizations Weekly Call; AEA; ASA; GPEMC Stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children and yout h in foster care, migratory students, children who are incarcerated, and other underserved students Equitable and Effective Schools Taskforce; Education Leaders Weekly Call; ADE and Education Organizations Weekly Call; Feedback sessions with Juvenile Deten tion Education Programs Stakeholders; Feedback sessions with Children and Youth in Foster Care Stakeholders, to include Children's Action Alliance, Arizona's Children Association and Arizona Friends of Foster Children Foundation 35 2. Coordinating Funds : Describe to what extent the SEA has and will coordinate Federal COVID -19 pandemic funding and other Federal funding. This description must include: i. How the SEA and its LEAs 1) are using or have used prior to the submission of this plan and 2) plan to use following submission of this plan , Federal COVID -19 funding under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act and the CRRSA Act to support a safe return to and safely maximiz e in-person instruction, sustain these operations safely, and address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on individual student groups (including students from low -income families, children with disabilities, English learners, racial or ethnic minorities, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care , and migratory students ); Complete the table below or provide a narrative description. ADE's overarching goal with ESSER funds is to support communities recovering from COVID -19, position our state's education system to better support student success, and ensure Arizona has a 21st -century ready workforce. ADE plans to use its SEA's reserve t o support emergency needs statewide strategically and equitably to reach students and communities in each of Arizona's fifteen counties. Each of ADE's current and future investments using ESSER funds follows a rubric to ensure these funds: Support students and communities most impacted by COVID -19 Expand schools' access to evidence -based programs and training Address multiple factors that impact students' academics, including: social- emotional wellbeing, educator workforce shortages, and family internet connectivity All publicly announced projects funded by ESSER SEA set -aside funds are posted on the agency's website .

To what extent ESSER I and ESSER II funds have been awarded to LEAs and, if funds have not yet been made available to LEAs , when they will be . In addition, please provide any available information on the total dollar amounts of ESSER I and ESSER II funds that have been obligated but not expe nded by the SEA and its LEAs , including whether the SEA is able to track LEA obligations . The following data are provided as of 7/18/2021: ESSER I LEA allocations and grant applications were released on May 29, 2020 $263,429,711.10 was awarded to Title I -A and Non -Title I -LEAs and entities through ESSER I. $177,819,010.03 has been drawn down, representing 68% of all LEA ESSER I grant awards. Title I -A LEAs (mandatory subgrantees) have drawn down $170,433,434.56, or 67% of their total awards. Non- Title I - A LEAs (funded through SEA reserved funds) have drawn down $7,385,575. 47, or 70% of their total awards. ESSER II LEA allocations and grant applications were released on February 18, 2021 $1,084,600,742.83 was awarded to Title I -A and Non- Title I -LEAs and entities through ESSER II. $85,167,821.66 has been drawn down, repres enting 8% of all LEA ESSER II grant awards. Title I -A LEAs (mandatory subgrantees) have drawn down $80,978,643.72, or 8% of their total awards. Non- Title I -A LEAs (funded through SEA reserved funds) have drawn down $4,189,177.94, or 10% of their total awar ds. ARP ESSER LEA allocations and grant application were released on May 24, 2021 $2,367,408,840.35 was awarded to Title I -A and Non- Title I -LEAs and entities through ARP ESSER . ADE is not currently able to track LEA obligations. To do so will require a new LEA data submission and collection process. ADE is the in process of reviewing the proposed data collection and reporting requirements for ESSER I, II and III released by ED on July 2, 2021. The proposed business rules are extensive and will require the creation of new collection and reporting capacities at the SEA to capture new fiscal and programmatic data elements from LEA ESSER fund grantees. 43 iii. In supporting LEAs as they plan for the safe return to and continuity of in- person instruction and for meeting the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students resulting from the COVID- 19 pandemic , the extent to which the SEA is also using other Federal fund ing sources including but not limited to under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( \"ESEA \"), IDEA, Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act ( \"WIOA \"), funding for child nutrition services, and McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance Act, and the funds to support the needs of students experiencing homelessness provided by section 2001(b)(1) of the ARP Act.3 ADE has an established Strategic Funding Support Team. Th e team is comprised of senior leadership representing the primary decision makers for all agency grant programs. The goal s of this team have been to streamline internal processes, support LEAs in planning for an applying for grant funds and to develop collaborative technical assistance for LEAs to support local efficient spending, and effectively utilize agency funding to support students, teachers, leaders, families, and communities. This Strategic Funding Support Team has: Provided cross -functional inter nal leadership and internal staff professional learning Created partnerships and provide d guidance to LEAs to support strategic use of funding, and, Continue s to build agency- wide technical assistance and support systems. Additionally, ADE staff capacity is being expanded to support providing technical assistance and programmatic monitoring for LEA grantees. These positions will also support LEAs through developing and providing guidance and trainings for LEAs for the ESSER funds programs and on developing and maintaining collaborative relationships with local, regional, and state community partners to support implementation efforts. A particular focus will be on supporting local strategic, integrated planning and budgeting and sustainability planning. The intent is to ensure LEAs can effectively utilize their ESSER funds in an integrated manner in concert with other local, state and federal funds , and to proactively plan and identify how local funding 3 Please note that the needs of students experiencing home lessness must be addressed (along with the other groups disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic) through the use of the ARP ESSER SEA reservations and the required LEA reservation for the academic impact of lost instructional time; the funding provided to support the needs of students experiencing homelessness by section 2001(b)(1) of the ARP Act is in addition to the supports and services provided with ARP ESSER funds. 44 sources may be used to effectively sustain programs and strategies when the ESSER funds expire. To further support our LEAs, ADE applied for and received a fiscal waiver from ED to waive the carryo ver limitation for FY2020 Title I -A funds and extend the period of availability for FY2019 ESEA funds. This has supported our LEAs to leverage their ESEA funds more effectively to support local needs given the disruptive impact of the pandemic from Spring 2020 through the SY 2020- 2021 school year. Additionally, ADE received a programmatic waiver for Title IV -A content area spending requirements and the 15% limitation on the use of funds for technology infrastructure to provide additional flexibility for LEA s to leverage their Title IV -A funds to support local needs. ADE has applied for a renewal of both the ESEA fiscal and Title IV-A programmatic waivers to provide our LEAs further local flexibility as they prepare for the safe return to in -person instructio n in SY 2020- 2021. The ADE Health and Nutrition Services (HNS) Unit has supported LEAs with guidance for Child Nutrition Program operators , particularly regarding navigating COVID -19 guidance provided by USDA and the agency to help ensure students have had access to nutritious meals both during school closures, throughout the school year and during the summer. HNS has also supported the implementation of the Pandemic -EBT (P -EBT) program for eligible families. 45 D. Maximizing State -Level Funds to Support Students The Department recognizes that States have an extraordinary opportunity to address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on underserved students through the ARP Act's required State set -asides to address the academic impact of lost instructional time, provide summer learning and enrichment programs, and provide com prehensive afterschool programs. In this section, SEAs will describe their evidence- based strategies for these resources. 1. Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(1) of the ARP Act ( totaling not less than 5 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) on evidence -based interventions to address the academic impact of lost instructional time by supporting the implementation of evidence- based interventions, such as summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs, and ensure that such interventions respond to students' academic, social, emotional , and mental heal th needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based interventions (e.g., providing intensive or high- dosage tutoring, accelerating learning ) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those interventions on an ongoing basis to understand if they are working; As noted above in Section C .2. Table C1, ADE has selected several specific , evidence- based interventions that a ddress the academic impact of lost instructional time. Many of these interventions may be extended into an additional year using ARP ESSER funds depending on proven effectiveness and demand from field for on -going intervention . Interven tions were selected based on ADE's strategic priorities , a rubric for impact, and recommendations from stakeholders. Regarding additional evidence -based interventions and the designated ARP ESSER funds, ADE intends to focus on the following priorities identified by stakeholders , including: 1) Enrichment and reinforcement to learning 2) Mental, behavioral, and physical health support for students and educators 3) Student and family re-engagement and support for critical academic transition periods The selection process for additional and on- going interventions will include: Establishing a working group of internal experts and stakeholders for each priority area. Generating and evaluating targeted, evidence- based strategies available for vulnerable populations in Arizona . 46 Setting criteria for funding ; including d etermin ing tiered or prioritized level of support for LEAs or communities based on available COVID- impact data . Determin ing distribution method and appropriate grant sizes based on intervention, scale, and community need. Vetting solicitations and available services across Arizona. The Equitable & Effective Schools Task Force asked that ADE keep the following in mind regarding ARP ESSER fund distribution: LEA and C ommunity Based Organization (CBO) capacity and opportunity for partnership Awards large enough to make a demonstrable difference Application process that is not overly or unneces sarily burdensome to applicants Flexibility to address ev olving needs around pandemic using data Braiding and leveraging other sour ces of funding for sustainability ADE will collect data aligned to federal reporting requirements , survey the field and partners involved with the intervention, and engage i n on-going stakeholder engagement to understand whether the intervention is working. ADE will take into consideration state and local policies on COVID mitigation and re -opening schools that may impact the effectiveness of the intervention. Lastly, ADE will lean on national research and clearing houses of information on evidence- based inte rventions and evaluate what is fitting or can be customized to Arizona's communities . ii. How the evidence- based interventions will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to determine the impact of lost instructional time ; an Several of the ADE's current interventions are targeted and designed to be culturally responsive to support the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on the student groups listed in question A.3.i. -viii. Most of the students in Arizona's public school system fall within such student groups and are also impacted by statewide or schoolwide interventions underway. ADE will continue to use the available statewide data sources to address disproportionate impact of COVID -19 and target additional interventions to vulnerable student populations. ADE was able to develop this type of process 47 for its Acceleration Academ y grant program using GEER I funding. For that program, ADE used the following data to prioritize awards based on COVID impact : Free and Reduced Lunch applications Not Proficien t AzMERIT ELA and Math scores (statewide assessment) Unemployment claims in corresponding zip codes COVID cases in corresponding zip codes No access to computer in corresponding zip codes No access to internet in corresponding zip codes Moreover, in evaluating inventions for vulnerable groups of students , ADE will also consider strategies and challenges identified by stakeholders. For example, advocates working with foster care students cited transport ation as a barrier to student access to afterschool programs where they benefit from structured time for homework and a safe environment to interact with adults and peers. iii. The extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in- person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruct ion when offered during school building closures . ADE will continue to utilize data as fit to target resources to students who missed the most instruction over the course of the pandemic. The following data on instructional modes from the 2020- 2021 school year available: ID numbers of students no longer enrolled in AZ public system LEAs with waivers for onsite services due to public health orders ; meaning buildings were closed and 100% of students and staff were in distance learning. Mode of instruction offered at each LEA at, at least one point during 2020- 2021 school year . (LEA -level) The percent of student body in distance learning on the 40th day of the school year and on the last day. *D ocumentation on how attendance was being taken should show whether the student was in distance learning or in-person for a given day. This is not, however, required to be reported publicly. (School -level) Number of days of in- person, teacher -led instruction was offered (by August 1, 2021 based on state legislation) ADE has already undertaken several of initiatives to identify and engage students who have been missing or disengaged from schools , including: 48 Providing LEAs a list of students who were enrolled in their school the year prior but are no longer enrolled in another public school across the system. This data will help LEAs adopt strategies for reaching out to students they know are missing from the system. It is possible, however, that those students may be enrolled in a private school, homeschooled, or moved across state lines. Launching the Ready for School campaign to encourage students and families to reenroll in their public schools. The campaign uses video and media ads to highlight the many benefits of in- person school. ADE has also used ESSER funds to create a hotline to support parents with the enrollm ent process Establishing an internal team working on a comprehensive system of supports or a cohort of schools that received waivers from having to provide onsite services due to local public health orders. The buildings of these schools were closed throughout the pandemic , and students could not access computer labs or special education services even if instruction was led online. The working assumption is that students enrolled in these schools missed the most in -person instruction across the state. The ADE team is working to identify their unique needs and hel p link to resources across ADE's program team s. ADE will consider the use of ARP ESSER funds to scale current efforts or adopt additional approaches to target interventions at students who missed the most school last year. 2. Evidence -Based Summer Learning and Enrichment Programs : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(2) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 1 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) for evidence -based summer learning and enrichment programs , including those that begin in Summer 2021, and ensure such programs respond to students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based programs that address the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students (e.g., providing intensive or high- dosage tutoring, accelerating learning ) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those programs ; See Section D.1 on ADE's process for ARP ESSER funds . This includes summer learning and enrichment programs. ADE is a participant in a collaborative network of State Education Agency (SEA) staff convened by the National Summer Learning Association and 49 Council of State School Officers . The intent is for SEAs to build knowledge and capacity on how to develop community system -wide strategies to support learning . This network will support ADE in identifying evidence -based programs and standards for practice, as well as develop ing guidance for LEAs on the effective use of local ESSER funds to advance summer enrichment . ii. How the evidence- based programs will specifically address the disproport ionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3. i.--viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to identify students most in need of summer learning and enrichment programs ; and See Section D.1 on ADE's process for ARP ESSER funds. This includes summer learning and enrichment programs. iii. The extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in- person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruct ion when offered during school building closures . See Section D.1 on ADE's process for ARP ESSER funds. This includes summer learning and enrichment programs. 3. Evidence -Based Comprehensive Afterschool Programs : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(3) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 1 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) for evidence- based comprehensive afterschool programs (including, for example, before -school programming) , and ensure such programs respond to students' academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based programs (e.g., including partnershi ps with community -based organizations) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those programs ; See Section D.1 on ADE's process for ARP ESSER funds. This includes comprehensive afterschool programs. 50 ii. How the evidence- based programs will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to identify students most in need of comprehensive afterschool programming; and See Section D.1 on ADE's process for ARP ESSER funds. This includes comprehensive afterschool programs. iii. the extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in- person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures . See Section D.1 above on ADE's process for ARP ESSER funds. This includes comprehensive afterschool programs. 4. Emergency Needs : If the SEA plans to reserve funds for emergency needs under section 2001(f)(4) of the AR P Act to address issues responding to the COVID- 19 pandemic , describe the anticipated use of those funds, including the extent to which these funds will build SEA and LEA capacity to ensure students' and staff's health and safety ; to meet students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs ; and to use ARP ESSER funds to implemen t evidence- based interventions . ADE views the goal of ESSER recovery funds is to support communities recovering from COVID -19, position our state's educational system to support student success, and ensure Arizona has a 21st -century ready workforce. Our goal is to allocate federal recovery dollars from the SEA's reserve to support emergency needs statewide strategically and equitably in order to reach students and communities in each of Arizona's fifteen counties. Where possible, we have taken advantage of the opportunity to leverage thes e funds alongside existing investments. ADE will further leverage an ongoing stakeholder engagement process to ensure that future investments are effectively targeted to meet the ongoing unique needs of Arizona's schools, students, and communities statewid e. Each of ADE's current and future investments using ARP ESSER funds follows a rubric to ensure these funds: 51 Support students and communities most impacted by COVID -19 Expand schools' access to evidence -based programs and trainings Address multiple facto rs that impact students' academics, including: o Social -emotional wellbeing o Educator workforce shortages o Family internet connectivity ADE is committed to measuring and evaluating the success and impact of these investments. ADE has also leveraged ARP ESSER funds to provide additional LEA assistance for Title I -A LEAs, Non -Title I -A LEAs, and Career Technical Education Districts (CTEDs). $47,500,838.92 has been allocated to LEAs for this purpose. 52 E. Supporting LEAs in Planning for and Meeting Students' Needs The Department recognizes that the safe return to in -person instruction must be accompanied by a focus on meeting students ' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs, and by addressing the opportunity gaps that existed before - and were exacerbated by - the pandemic. In this section, SEAs will describe how they will support their LEAs in developing high- quality plans for LEAs' use of ARP ESSER funds to achieve these objectives. 1. LEA Plans for the Use of ARP ESSER Funds : Describe what the SEA will require its LEAs to include in LEA plans consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements for the use of ARP ESSER funds , how the SEA will require such plans to be made available to the public , and the deadline by which the LEA must submit its ARP ESSER plan (which must be a reasonable timeline and should be within no later than 90 days after receiving its ARP ESSER allocation ). The LEA plans must include, at a minimum: i. The extent to which and how the funds will be used to implement prevention and mitigation strategies that are, to the greatest extent practicable, in line with the most recent CDC guidance, in order to continuously and safely operate schools for in- person learning; ii. How the LEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 20 percent of the LEA's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds) to address the academic impact of lost instructional time through the implemen tation of evidence -based interventions, such as summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs; iii. How the LEA will spend its remaining ARP ESSER funds consistent with section 2001(e) (2) of the ARP Act ; and iv. How the LEA will ensure that the interventions it implements , including but not limited to the interventions under section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act to address the academic impact of lost instructional time , will respond to the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students, and particularly those students disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic, including students from low -income families, students of color, English learner s, children with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, and migratory students. ADE released ARP ESSER LEA allocations and grant application on May 24, 2021. ADE's comprehensive guidance and support materials for the LEA ARP ESSER grant process are posted on the agency's ARP ESSER website . ADE set a n original target date of August 23, 2021 for LEAs to submit their ARP ESSER application - which is 90 days from Arizona's release of ARP ESSER allocations and grant application. ADE has updated this target date to November 1, 2021 to allow LEAs to complete their st akeholder engagement and update their strategic planning and budgeting processes - particularly 53 given the context of the COVID -19 Delta Variant, and the need to adjust local planning based on the current and projected potential impact on school and LEA ope rations for the SY 2021- 2022 school year. The ARP ESSER LEA plan requirements as outlined in ED's Interim Final Rule have been embedded within the LEA ARP ESSER online grant application as both required assurances for compliance and in the collection of t he required content for the plan. The ARP ESSER grant application includes a Program Narrative Questions page within the application. This page is designed to supplement the more detailed budget narrative section of the LEA application and provide account ability to ensure that all budgeted activities included by the LEA in their application align to an allowability category for ARP ESSER per ARP Sec. 2001(e)(2). The agency's ESSER I and II application contain similar pages to support this purpose with respect to the requirements of the CARES and CRRSA Acts. The following are selected screen shots of this page from the ARP ESSER application: 54 ADE has added required response sections on the Program Narrative Questions page for LEAs to address subsections (I - the extent to which an LEA is leveraging ARP ESSER funds to implement CDC mitigation strategies) and (iv - how the LEA will ensure the activities implemented will address the acad emic, social, emotional and mental health needs of all students) above: Additionally, ADE created a new 'Required LEA Set -Aside' page within the application. This page is designed to supplement the more detailed budget narrative section of the LEA application and provide accountability to ensure LEAs meet the required set aside requirements. This page prepopulates and automatically calculates the required minimum 20% of an LEA's total ARP ESSER award that must be reserved to address learning loss : 55 LEAs are required to complete the set aside page based on their planned evidence- based activities, and asso ciated total budget for those activities, to support academic, social and emotional needs within each major listed category of Summer Learning or Summer Enrichment Programs , Extended Day Programs , Comprehensive Afterschool Programs , Extended School Year Pr ograms and Other: Subtotals are captured for each major category and are then totaled. The page includes validations to ensure no less than 20% of the LEA's total ARP ESSER award has been represented on this page. The validation results in an error that will prevent an LEA from submitting their application until it is corr ected. ADE is leveraging existing staff from our School Support and Improvement unit to support the review of ARP ESSER LEA grant applications. In part, this will help to ensure the requirement s per ARP Sec. 2001( e)(1) that all required set aside funded activities to address learning loss and meet student academic, social, emotional and mental health needs are also evidence- based - particularly in their application in support of our most vulnerable student populations - are met. ADE has included the following required assurance to ensure LEAs comply with the ARP ESSER LEA plan development stakeholder engagement requirements per ED's Interim Final Rule: 56 ADE will include a review of local documentation of the stakeholder engagement process used to develop an LEA's ARP ESSER plan, and the LEA's posted plan to ensure compliance with these requirements as part of LEA programmatic monitoring activities. ADE has further provided the expectation that the local ARP ESSER LEA plan is a living document, whi ch can be revised and updated throughout the period of availability of the grant program, to include the expectation of ongoing stakeholder engagement to support this process. 57 2. LEA Consultation: Describe how the SEA will, in planning for the use of ARP ESSER funds, ensure that , consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements ], its LEAs engage in meaningful consultation with stakeholders, including, but not limited to: i. students; ii. families; iii. school and district administrators (including special education administrators); and iv. teachers, principals, school leaders, other educators, school staff, and their unions. The LEA must also engage in meaningful consultation with each of the following to the extent present in or served by the LEA: i. Tribes; ii. civil rights organizations (including disability rights organizations); and iii. stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migratory students, children who are incarcerated, and other underserved students. The description must also include how the SEA will ensure that LEAs provide the public the opportunity to provide input in the development of the LEA's plan for the use of ARP ESSER funds and take such input into account. ADE has included the following required assurance to ensure LEAs comply with the ARP ESSER LEA plan development stakeholder engagement requirements per ED's Interim Final Rule: ADE will include a review of local documentation of the stakeholder engagement process used to develop an LEA's ARP ESSER plan, and the LEA's posted plan to ensure c ompliance with these requirements as part of LEA programmatic monitoring activities. ADE partnered with Achieve60AZ, College Success Arizona, Expect More Arizona and Arizona School Administrators to create and share an ' ARP ESSER and Community Input Partner Toolkit ' posted on ADE's ARP ESSER website to assist LEAs with their local stakeholder engagement efforts. This toolkit contains resources and strategies for effectively engaging 58 stakeholders, along with a list of spec ific community stakeholder organizations representing the needs of vulnerable student populations , with links to each organization and their contact information. Practical information is shared regarding how to conduct community forums, both virtually and in -person and how to craft effective surveys to gather actionable data and information to inform local planning. Real examples from different LEAs across the state are also provided - such as sample surveys, flyers, emails and social media posts . The Arizo na School Administrators (ASA) and Arizona School Boards Association (ASBA) are supporting our collective efforts to raise awareness for this toolkit to support local engagement efforts. ADE has further provided the expectation that the local ARP ESSER LEA plan is a living document, which can be revised and updated throughout the period of availability of the grant program, to include the expectation of ongoing stakeholder engagement to support this process . 3. Describe how the SEA will support and monitor its LEA s in using ARP ESSER funds. The description must include: i. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs' implementation of evidence- based interventions that respond to students' academic, social, emotion al, and mental health needs , such as through summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs - including the extent to which the SEA will collect evidence of the effectiveness of interventions employed; ADE's SEA capacity to collect and report data will need to be enhanced to provide the capacity to collect data regarding the participation in programs funded by ARP ESSER resources, such as disaggregated student -level data to address LEA implementation of evidence -based strategies, as well as evidence of the effectiveness of their implemented strategies. As referenced in Section E, ADE captures detailed information regarding how LEAs will meet the required 20% set- aside to address learning loss, as well as the ARP ESSER LEA Plan requirement to indicate ' how the LEA will ensure the activities implemented will address the academic, social, emotional and mental health needs of all students ' as part of the LEA ARP ESSER grant application. ADE is the in process of reviewing the proposed data collection and reporting requirements for ESSER I, II and ARP ESSER released by ED on July 2, 2021. The proposed business rules are extensive and will require the creation of new collection and reporting capacities at the SEA to capture new fiscal and programmatic data elements from LEA grantees. 59 Additionally, ADE staff capacity is being expanded to support providing technical assistance and programmatic monitoring for LEA grantees. These positions will also support LEAs through developing and providing guidance and trainings for LEAs for the ESSER funds programs, particularly with respect to local strategic, integrated planning and budgeting and sustainability planning; and developing and m aintain ing collaborative relationships with local, regional, and state community partners . These positions will further work to identif y and analy ze data needed to adhere to all ESSER Funds data reporting requirements to meet applicable reporting deadlines . ii. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs in specifically addressing the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii; and Please see response to Section 3(i) above. Additionally, the ADE Equitable and Effective Schools Taskforce (described in Section C and D) will be used to provide ongoing feedback to the SEA regarding Arizona's implementation of ESSER fund programs to support our stat e's most vulnerable student populations. This feedback will serve to inform both LEA grantee technical assistance and support provided by ADE, as well as supporting future targeting of ESSER SEA set -aside funds to ensure they are effectively and sustainabl y meeting the needs Arizona's students and education community. iii. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs in using ARP ESSER funds to identify, reengage, and support students most likely to have experienced the impact of lost instructional time on student learning, such as: a. Students who have missed the most in- person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 school years; b. Students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school buildi ng closures; and c. Students most at -risk of dropping out of school. Please see response to Section 3(i) above. In addition to the data and information shared by LEAs as part of the ARP ESSER LEA grant application, and technical assistance and professional learning supports provided by ADE staff , the ADE Equitable and Effective Schools Taskforce (described in Section C and D) will be used to provide ongoing feedback to the SEA regarding Arizona's implementation of ESSER fund programs - to includ e supporting students whose student learning may be 60 most impacted due to the loss and/or disruption of instructional learning time, and those student who may be most at -risk (or may now be at an elevated risk based on the challenges of the prior year) of d ropping out of school. This feedback will serve to inform both LEA grantee technical assistance and support provided by ADE, as well as supporting future targeting of ESSER SEA set -aside funds to ensure they are effectively and sustainably meeting the need s Arizona's students and education community. ADE has additionally provided resources and supports for schools to assist the them to safely reop en for in- person instruction , to include sharing ED's 3 volumes of the COVID -19 Handbook. Further, LEAs are required to revise and updated, at a minimum every 6 months through September 30, 2023, their LEA Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Continuity of Services Pla n, per the requirements of the ARP Act. These plans will provide additional accountability regarding local LEA plans for supporting the students' academic needs and students' and staff social, emotional, mental health, and other needs as LEAs move forward with their local recovery efforts. 4. Describe the extent to which the SEA will support its LEAs in implementing additional strategies for taking educational equity into account in expending ARP ESSER funds, including but not limited to: i. Allocating funding both to schools and for districtwide activities based on student need, and ii. Implementing an equitable and inclusive return to in- person instruction. An inclusive return to in -person instruction includes, but is not limited to, establishing policies and practices that avoid the over-use of exclusionary discipline measures (including in- and out - of-school suspensions) and creating a positive and supportive learning environment for all students . ADE staff capacity is being expanded to support providing technical assistance and programmatic monitoring for LEA grantees. These positions will also support LEAs through developing and providing guidance and trainings for LEAs for the ESSER funds programs, particularly with respect to local strategic, integrated planning and budgeting and sustainability planning. Additionally, ADE will continue to closely collaborate with statewide advocacy and professional organizations, such as the Arizona School Administrators (ASA), Arizona Sc hool Boards Association (ASBA), Arizona Association of School Business Officials (AASBO) and the Arizona Charter Schools Association (ACSA), as well as partnerships with County School Superintendents to provide timely, focused communications, technical assistance and professional learning to support local LEA implementation efforts. 61 ADE has championed the use of local decision making for leveraging ESSER funds to accelerate and enrich learning and increase learning opportunities and creating positive and s upportive learning environments - particularly for our most vulnerable populations. ADE is committed to working collaboratively to support schools to use local, state and federal entitlement and recovery funds effectively and strategically to meet immediate needs and to make thoughtful, sustainable investments in support of ongoing local recovery efforts ADE recognizes that the ESSER funds represent a generational opportunity to make strategic, sustainable investments to help address systemic inequities a nd unleash innovation and creativity to transform teaching and learning to realize our agency's shared vision of Equity for All Students to Achieve their Full Potential. 62 F. Supporting the Educator Workforce The Department recognizes the toll that the COVID -19 pandemic has taken on the Nation's educators as well as students. In this section, SEAs will describe strategies for supporting and stabilizing the educator workforce and for making staffing decisions that will support students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs. 1. Supporting and Stabilizing the Educator Workforce : i. Describe the extent to which the State is facing shortages of educators, education administration personnel, and other school personnel involved in safely reopening schools, and the extent to which they vary by region/type of school district and/or groups of educators (e.g., special educators and related services personnel and paraprofessionals ; bilingual or English as a second language educators ; science, technology, engineering, and math ( \"STEM \") educators ; career and technical education (\"CTE\") educators; early childhood educators). Cite specific data on shortages and needs where available. Complete the table below , changing or adding additional rows as needed, or provide a narrative description. Table F1. Area Data on shortages and needs Narrative description Special educators and related service personnel and paraprofessionals Appropriately certified data - Percentage of positions filled with not appropriately certified staff: (Area - FY19/FY21) Mild -Moderate - 15%/13% Early Childhood Special Education - 15%/14% Learning Disability - 15%/15% Severe- Profound - 17%/28% Emotional Disability - 26%/14% According to the 202 0-21 shortage report data that Arizona submitted to the USED for the annual Teacher Shortage report, 4 of the 13 shortage areas are in special education positions. Paraprofessionals are not licensed/certified by the state . Data regarding paraprofessionals are available at the local level. Anecdotally , most LEAs report challenges in finding qualified paraprofessionals to fill all available positions. Bilingual educators Percentage of Bilingual positions not filled with appropriately certified staff: FY19 - 24% FY21 - 35% According to FY19 appropriately certified data of the 71 positions reported 24% were filled by not appropriately certified staff and although positions declined in FY2021, 35% of the 66 positions were f illed with not appropriately certified staff. Legislative changes have provided additional flexibilities in the instruction 63 Area Data on shortages and needs Narrative description of English learners and bilingual education. It is anticipated these changes will increase the number of bilingual positions needed. It is unknown what the true demand for bilingual positions are due to gaps in current data collection. English as a second language educators Percentage of Structured English Immersion positions not filled with appropriately certified staff: FY19 - 15% FY21 - 16% According to appropriately certified data, in FY19 15% of positions were filled with not appropriately certified staff and increased to 16% in FY21. STEM educators Percentage of STEM positions not filled with appropriately certified staff: (Area - FY19/FY21) General Science - 17%/33% Chemistry - 12%/15% Earth Science - 35%/40% Physics - 15%/23% Middle Grades Math - 22.5%/23% According to appropriately certified data, Science areas continue to be a shortage area as well as middle grades mathematics. CTE educators In 2021 there were 197 improperly certified teachers out of 2050 teachers teaching CTE programs. The ADE CTE Unit further estimates that there is a vacancy rate of approximately 10% for CTE teaching positions stat ewide. The ADE CTE unit has received anecdotal feedback that a school will close a program if a teacher is not found. Data on CTE positions filled by substitute teachers when a certified CTE teacher could not be found are not currently available. Early c hildhood educators Percentage of Early Childhood Special Education positions not filled with appropriately certified staff: FY19 - 10% FY21 - 15% According to appropriately certified data, Early Childhood Special Education continues to be a shortage area. School counselors All but 4 of the 198 awarded school counselor positions under the state funded School Safety Program have been filled for FY21/22 with candidates meeting the position qualifications (98% filled). Requests for another 81 school counselor positions received by the ADE were unable to be filled because of inadequate state funding of the program. Because of the known increase in need for these positions created by the pandemic, ADE utilized ESSER II fun ds to award these positions to schools. It is not yet known whether the positions can be filled with qualified individuals. 64 Area Data on shortages and needs Narrative description Social workers All but 3 of the 140 awarded school social worker positions under the state funded School Safety Program have bee n filled for FY21/22 with candidates meeting the position qualifications (98% filled). Requests for another 100 school social worker positions received by the ADE were unable to be filled because of inadequate state funding of the program. Because of the k nown increase in need for these positions created by the pandemic, ADE utilized ESSER II funds to award these positions to schools. It is not yet known whether the positions can be filled with qualified individuals. Nurses Data on unmet school nurse ne eds and vacancies is not collected by the ADE. Anecdotally , it is known that several districts are unable to fill advertised positions due to non- competitive salaries that are offered. Similar to counselors and social workers, the issue of inadequate nurse s seems to be more a funding issue and that positions are not created because of inadequate funds. School psychologists Number of school psychologist vacancies: FY19: 53 (4%) FY20: 47 (4%) Results from the ADD Exceptional Student Services (ESS) Unit Teacher Attrition Survey Vacancies do not reflect all positions needed as the AZ school psychologist to student ratio (1:1,320) is much higher than the nationally recommended ratio (1:500- 700) per data reported by the Arizona Association of School Psychologists . ii. Describe how the SEA will assist its LEAs in identifying the most urgent are as of shortages or potential shortages, with particular plans for individual LEAs facing the most significant needs (e.g., by avoiding layoffs, providing high- quality professional learning opportunities , and addressing the impact of stress or trauma on educators) . Include a description of how other Federal COVID- 19 funding (e.g., ESSER and GEER funds under the CARES Act and CRRSA Act) have already been used to avoid layoffs during the COVID- 19 pandemic . Through our data collection, LEAs identify areas o f need and ADE supports them through communication with Education Preparation Programs (EPP), providing a statewide job fair both in person and virtual, as well as a statewide job board for educators and education positions - the Arizona Education Employment Board . 65 ADE has created an Educator Recruitment and Retention team focusing on supporting the LEAs in recruitment and retention strategies as well as leveraging stakeholder partnerships. This team has also developed and implemented Principal and Supervisor of Principal professional learning academies to build leadership capacity in LEAs to ensure support of students and educators. ADE actively partners with the Arizona K12 Center to support LEAs statewide through professional learning and on recruitment and retention strategies. We collectively revised our state's induction and mentoring standards and provide LEAs professional learning and support to increase capacity for induction and mentoring as a vehicle to increase teacher efficacy and retention. iii. Describe the actions the SEA will take to fill anticipated gaps in certified teachers for the start of the 2021 -2022 school year and to what extent the SEA will further support its LEAs in expanding the educator pipeline and educator diversity while addressing the immediate needs of students disproportionately impacted by the pandemic (e.g., recruiting teaching candidates to provide high- dosage tutoring or implementing residencies for teacher candidat es). ADE actively assists LEAs in creating Classroom -based educator preparation programs to expand the local educator pipeline and address educator diversity. Additionally, ADE is supporting all educator preparation programs (EPPs) in providing data and strategies for the recruitment of future educators as well as ensuring efficacy in program completers. New legislation potentially allows community colleges to expand their role by offering bachelor's degrees. ADE will work with the community college t o assist in standing up expanded educator preparation programs that more reflect the community. ADE also facilitates a state -wide job board and job fair to assist LEAs in reaching a diverse pool of candidates for all teaching and support positions. As the accountability team analyzes gap s for students, the ADE will identify LEAs for targeted support and assistance in implementing impactful strategies to address need as well as partner with EPPs in utilizing strategies for the benefit of LEAs and student needs. 66 2. Staffing to Support Student Needs : Describe the extent to which the SEA has developed or will develop strategies and will support its LEAs in increasing student access to key support staff within school buildings , including school counselors, special education personnel, nurses, social workers, and psychologists (e.g. hiring additional personnel or freeing up these staff to focus on providing services to students) . The ADE Certification unit is supporting the work of the School Sa fety unit and their implementation of the school safety grant. ADE further a supported rule change to create additional certification pathways for school counselors and helped to create a new School Social Worker certificate. The ADE School Safety and Social Wellness unit is collaborating with the state school counselor and school social worker organizations to advertise the positions awarded to schools through the School Safety Program. This collaboration has extended to public and p rivate universities to develop a stronger pipeline of social workers selecting schools as their workplace of choice. Cross -program collaboration within the ADE is occurring to strengthen professional development and support provided to these positions to i mprove job performance and increase retention. The ADE School Safety and Social Wellness unit is also collaborating with the Arizona Nurse Association to investigate options for increasing the pipeline of nurses to schools in anticipation of the funding received by the state health department for school nurses. 67 G. Monitoring and Measuring Progress The Department recognizes that transparency on how ARP ESSER funds are used and their impact on the Nation's education system is a fundamental responsibility of Federal, State, and local government . In this section, SEAs will describe how they are building capacity at the SEA and LEA levels to ensure high- quality data collection and reporting and to safeguard funds for their intended purposes. 1. Capacity for Data Collection and Reporting: It is important for an SEA to continuous ly monitor progress and make adjustments to its strategies , as well as to support its LEAs in making adjustments to LEA strategies, based on impact . Describe how the SEA will ensure its capacity and the capacity of its LEAs to collect data on reporting requirements, including but not limited to the examples of reporting requirements described in the SEA's Grant Award Notification (listed in Appendix B). Describe the SEA's capacity and strategy to collect data from its LEAs (disaggregated by student group , where applicable) , to the greatest extent practicable, including any steps the SEA will take to build its capacity in the future (which may include the use of ARP ESSER and other Federal COVID -19 pandemic funds at the SEA and LEA levels) , on issues that may include the following: i. Student learning, including the academic impact of lost instructional time during the COVID- 19 pandemic ; ADE collects statewide assessment data, disaggregated by student group, for Arizona's statewide assessments. These data are then reviewed, analyzed and reported to meet state and federal accountability requirements for making accountabi lity determinations. ADE administer s statewide assessments in Grades 3- 8 and once in high school for ELA and Mathematics and in grade bands 3- 5, 6-8, and once in high school for Science that are aligned to the State Academic Standard s (Note: this also includes Alternate Assessment ). Beginning in Spring 2022, Arizona will administer the Arizona's Academic Standards Assessment (AASA) in grades 3 - 8, ACT in Grade 11, and AzSCI in grades 5, 8, and 11 to meet this federal requirement, and will administer the ACT Aspire at grade 9. Arizona will also offer the SAT as part of the Menu of Assessments at Grade 11 , and administer the PSAT at grade 9. The following is a list of current projects of the ADE Assessment Unit: Implementation of the new statewide high school assessment - Grade 11 (ACT) Development of new AZSCI Operational Assessment - Grades 5, 8, and 11 Development of the new AZELLA aligned to the new ELP Standards Development of the new MSAA Science Assessment - Grades 5, 8, and 11 Impl ementation of the MSAA (Alternate Assessment) for ELA and Mathematics - Grades 3 - 8 and 11 68 Development of a new Alternate English Language Proficiency Assessment Grades K - 12 National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) assessment both National an d International Assessments Updates to Accessibility Manuals ii. Opportunity to learn measures (e.g., chronic absenteeism ; student engagement ; use of exclusionary discipline; access to and participation in advanced coursework; access to technology , including educator access to professional development on the effective use of technology; access to high -quality educators ; access to school counselors, social workers, nurses, and school psychologists; and results from student, parent, and/or educator surveys ); ADE currently collects disaggregated student -level chronic absenteeism data . ADE collects student access to and participation in advanced coursework, such as Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and Cambridge International c ourses. ADE also collects advanced placement exam data for these programs. ADE collects date regarding educator professional learning opportunities facilitated by the SEA. ADE collects data regarding access to appropriately certified teachers, as well as access to school counselors, social workers, nurses, and school psychologists . ADE also regularly collects position data from LEAs through the ADE Teacher Input Application (TIA), which then links certified educators to the positions they fill. The ADE TIA system also collects aggregated teacher evaluation data. Additionally, the Sch ool Finance unit collects positional information for all certified and non- certified positions in district LEAs through the School District Employee Reporting (SDER) system. ADE has leveraged the collection of data from stakeholders via online survey tools to support the implementation of statewide initiatives and program reporting requirements, as applicable. iii. Fiscal data that is comparable across the State (e.g., per-pupil expenditures at the LEA and school levels) ; Arizona school districts and charter schools are required to prepare an Annual Financial Report (AFR) for the preceding fiscal year and to annually submit this report to the ADE by October 15th. The annual AFR report summarizes 69 financial data across a number of funds, programs, and us es and includes school -level financial reporting data. After Annual Financial Reports are submitted, the data are processed by the ADE and used to calculate federally required per-pupil expenditure data and other state -required data points that appear i n Arizona school report cards at azreportcards.azed.gov. These data are also compiled to prepare the Superintendents Annual Financial Report (SAFR), which summarizes financial data for all school districts and charter schools in Arizona and is required by state statute to be annually published by January 15th. Updated financial data, to include updated school per pupil expenditures, are typically added to school report cards in late January. ADE will also compile, post, and annually report to ED SEA and LEA ARP ESSER Maintenance of Eq uity (MoEquity) data per ARP ESSER requirements. iv. Jobs created and retained (by position type); ADE collects data regarding the number of jobs created and/or retained by FTE within each ESSER fund (ESSER I, II and III) LEA grant application: ADE also regularly collects position data from LEAs through the ADE Teacher Input Application (TIA), which then links certified educators to the positions they fill. The ADE TIA system also collects aggregated teacher evaluation data. Addit ionally, the School Finance unit collects positional information for all certified and non- certified positions in district LEAs through the School District Employee Reporting (SDER) system. v. Participation in programs funded by ARP ESSER resources (e.g., summer and afterschool programs ); and ADE 's SEA capacity to collect and report data will need to be enhanced to provide the capacity to collect data regarding the p articipation in programs funded by ARP ESSER resources , such as disaggregated student -level data for participation in summer and afterschool programs . ADE is the in process of reviewing the proposed data collection and reporting requirements for ESSER I, II and III released by ED on July 2, 2021. The propose d business rules are extensive, and will require the creation of new collection and reporting capacities at the SEA to capture new fiscal and 70 programmatic data elements from the SEA, LEA grantees and entities funded using SEA set -aside funds across each ES SER fund grant. ADE has created new common data collection and program evaluation language for inclusion in all SEA set -aside funded project agreements and contracts that are aligned with ED's current proposed data reporting guidelines. This language incl udes references to required fiscal, programmatic and FTE position data reporting. vi. Other reporting requirements reasonably required by the Secretary (please refer to Appendix B of this template; final requirements will be issued separately ). Starting in SY2021 -2022, School Operating Status and Instructional Mode data will be collected at the student level via the Arizona Education Data Standards (AzEDS) process. AzEDS is the veh icle for ADE to collect all student- level data from LEAs for school finance and state and federal reporting. Leveraging AzEDS will allow for ADE to collect and report disaggregated student -level data reporting per the ongoing reporting requirements of Appendix A, Table 2 of the ARP ESSER State Plan Template , to include Mode of Instruction, Enrollment and Attendance for all students and disaggregated for each of the student groups described in A.3.i -viii for each mode of instruction (fully remote or online -only instruction; both remote/online and in- person instruction (hybrid model); and/or full -time in-person instruction) . ADE is the in process of reviewing the proposed data collection and reporting requirements for ESSER I, II and III released by ED on July 2, 2021. The proposed business rules are extensive and will require the creation of new collection and reporting capac ities at the SEA to capture new fiscal and programmatic data elements from the SEA, LEA grantees and entities funded using SEA set -aside funds across each ESSER fund grant. ADE has created new common data collection and program evaluation language for inclusion in all SEA set -aside funded project agreements and contracts that are aligned with ED's current proposed data reporting guidelines. This language includes references to required fiscal, programmatic and FTE position data reporting. ADE will additionally provide ongoing technical assistance and support for LEAs and SEA funded entities to help ensure quality and timeliness of submission of all required data. 71 2. Monitoring and Internal Controls : Describe how the SEA will implement appropriate fiscal monitoring of and internal controls for the ARP ESSER funds (e.g., by updating the SEA's plan for monitoring funds and internal controls under the CARES and CRRSA Acts ; addressing potential sources of waste, fraud, and abuse; conducting random audits ; or other tools ). In this response, please describe the SEA's current capacity to monitor ARP ESSER ; steps, if needed, to increase capacity ; and any foreseeable gaps in capacity , including how the SEA will provide its LEAs with technical assistance in the anticipated areas of greatest need . ADE will leverage existing agency processes to fiscally monitor LEAs receiving ESSER I, II and ARP ESSER funds. Current capacity is being expanded to meet the additional volume of monitoring that will be required due to the inclusion of these new grant programs. Fiscal monitoring for LEAs receiving ESSER grant funds will begin in calendar year 2022, after Completion Reports are submitted for the initial budget period of ESSER I (March 13, 2020 - September 30, 2021). LEAs are required to provide documentat ion as part of the Completion Report that includes high- level fiscal overview from the project. Completion Reports also contain required data and documentation regarding expenditures that occurred during the initial budget period. LEAs will be selected f or fiscal monitoring in accordance with ADE's existing Risk Assessment process, based on the Risk Assessment Rating (High -Low). In addition to the Completion Report review and approval process, fiscal monitoring will further consist of reviewing local LEAs policies for internal controls, procurement, and other required elements per Education Department General Administration Regulations (EDGAR) and the Uniform Grant Guidance (UGG). Material weaknesses that are identified through the fiscal monitoring proce ss will result in appropriate technical assistance and follow up, to include corrective action plans, as applicable. ADE is also in the process of increasing current agency capacity to fiscally monitor non-LEA entities receiving ESSER I, II and ARP ESSER SEA set -aside funds. To support this process, ADE has created new common data collection and program evaluation language for inclusion in all SEA set -aside funded project agreements and contracts that are aligned with ED's current proposed data reporting guidelines. This language includes references to required fiscal, programmatic and FTE position data reporting. 72 Appendix A: School Operating Status and Instructional Mode Data Template Indicate the date or time period represented by the following data. Data reported are as of Mid -May 2021 for SY 2020- 2021 Table 1 In the most recent time period available, how many schools in your State offer ed each mode of instruction or learning model described below ?

These non - discrimination ob ligations arise under Federal civil rights laws, including but not limited to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. In addition, the SEA must comply with all regulations, guidelines, and standards issued by the Department under any of these statutes ; The SEA will comply with all ARP Act and other ARP ESSER requirements and all requirements of its Grant Award Notification, including but not limited to: o Complying with the maintenance of effort provision in section 2004(a)(1) of the ARP Act, absent a waiver by the Secretary pursuant to section 2004( a)(2) of the ARP Act ; and o Complying with the maintenance of equit y provisions in section 2004(b) of the ARP Act, and ensuring its LEAs comply with the maintenance of equity provision in section 2004(c) of the ARP Act (please note that the Department will provide additional guidance on maintenance of equity shortly) ; The SEA will allocate ARP ESSER funds to LEAs in an expedited and timely manner and, to the extent practicable, not later than 60 days after the SEA receives ARP ESSER funds (i.e., 60 days from the date the SEA receives each portion of its ARP ESSER funds). An SEA that is not able to allocate such funds within 60 days because it is not practicable (e.g., because of pre- existing State board approval requirements) will provide an explanation to the Department within 30 days of receiving each portion of its ARP ESSER funds (submitted via email to your Program Officer at [State].OESE@ed.gov (e.g., Alabama.OESE@ed.gov)) , including a description of specific actions the SEA is taking to provide ARP ESSER funds to LEAs in an expedited and timely manner and the SEA's expected timeline for doing so; The SEA will implement evidence -based interventions as required under section 2001(f) of the ARP Act and ensure its LEAs implement evidence- based interventions , as required by section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act; The SEA will address the disproportionate impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on underserved students (i.e., students from low -income families, students from racial or ethnic groups (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by race or ethnicity) , gender (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by gender ), English learners, children with disabilities, students experienci ng homelessness, children and youth in foster care, and migratory students) , as required under section 2001(f) of the ARP Act, and ensure its LEAs address the disproportionate impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on underserved students (i.e., students from low -income families, students from racial or ethnic groups, gender, English learners, children with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, children and 77 youth in foster care, and migratory students) , as required by section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act; and The SEA will provide to the Department : (1) the URL(s) w here the public can readily find data on school operating status and (2) the URL(s) for the SEA and/or LEA websites where the public can find the LEA plans for a) the safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services required under section 2001(i) of the ARP Act , and b) use of ARP ESSER funds . SEAs should consider ensuring a standardized URL format in all cases (e.g., xxx.gov/COVIDplan). 78 Appendix D OMB Control No. 1894- 0005 (Exp. 06/ 30/2023 ) NOTICE TO ALL APPLICANTS The purpose of this enclosure is to inform you about a new provision in the Department of Educations General Education Provisions Act ( \"GEPA\" ) that applies to applicants for new grant awards under Department programs. This provision is Section 427 of GEPA, enacted as part of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Public Law (P.L.) 103- 382). To Whom Does This Provision Apply? Section 427 of GEPA affects applicants for new grant awards under this program. ALL APPLICANTS FOR NEW AWARDS MUST INCLUDE INFORMATION IN THEIR APPLICATIONS TO ADDRESS THIS NEW PROVISION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. (If this program is a State -formula grant program, a State needs to provide this description only for projects or activities that it carries out with funds reserved for State - level uses. In addition, local school districts or other eligible applicants that apply to the State for funding need to provide this description in their applications to the State for funding. The State would be responsible for e nsuring that the school district or other local entity has submitted a sufficient section 427 statement as described below.) What Does This Provision Require? Section 427 requires each applicant for funds (other than an individual person) to include in its application a description of the steps the applicant proposes to take to ensure equitable access to, and participation in, its Federally - assisted program for students, teachers, and other program beneficiaries with special needs. This provision allows applicants discretion in developing the required description. The statute highlights six types of barriers that can impede equitable access or participation: gender, race, national origin, color, disability, or age. Based on local circumstances, you should de termine whether these or other barriers may prevent your students, teachers, etc. from such access to, or participation in, the Federally -funded project or activity. The description in your application of steps to be taken to overcome these barriers need not be lengthy; you may provide a clear and succinct description of how you plan to address those barriers that are applicable to your circumstances. In addition, the information may be provided in a single narrative, or, if appropriate, may be discussed in connection with related topics in the application. Section 427 is not intended to duplicate the requirements of civil rights statutes, but rather to ensure that, in designing their projects, applicants for Federal funds address equity conce rns that may affect the ability of certain potential beneficiaries to fully participate in the project and to achieve high standards. Consistent with program requirements and its approved application, an applicant may use the Federal funds awarded to it to eliminate barriers it identifies. What are Examples of How an Applicant Might Satisfy the Requirement of This Provision? The following examples may help illustrate how an applicant may comply with Section 427. 79 (1) An applicant that proposes to carry out a n adult literacy project serving, among others, adults with limited English proficiency, might describe in its application how it intends to distribute a brochure about the proposed project to such potential participants in their native language. (2) An applicant that proposes to develop instructional materials for classroom use might describe how it will make the materials available on audio tape or in braille for students who are blind. (3) An applicant that proposes to carry out a model science program f or secondary students and is concerned that girls may be less likely than boys to enroll in the course, might indicate how it intends to conduct \"outreach\" efforts to girls, to encourage their enrollment. (4) An applicant that proposes a project to increas e school safety might describe the special efforts it will take to address concern s of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students, and efforts to reach out to and involve the families of LGBT students . We recognize that many applicants may already be implementing effective steps to ensure equity of access and participation in their grant programs, and we appreciate your cooperation in responding to the requirements of this provision.

Public reporting burden for thi s collection of information is estimated to average 3 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The obligation to respond to this collection is required to obtain or retain benefit (Public Law 103 -382). Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any othe r aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20210- 4537 or email ICDocketMgr@ed.gov and reference the OMB Control Number 1894- 0005 . 81 Appendix D: Response to Section 427 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) Section 427 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) requires a description of the steps that will be taken to ensure equitable access to, and participation in, federally assisted programs for students, teachers and other program beneficiaries. To ensure equitable participation and access project resources, the following considerations will be made: When requested, the Arizona Department of Education will produce dissemination materials (e.g., direct mailings, e -mails, on -line announcements) in both E nglish and Spanish. Other considerations will be made to ensure the document is readily accessible to traditionally underrepresented groups. The project staff will coordinate the process of cooperation and collaboration between and among the project partic ipants to ensure equitable access and participation of recipients of the project funds. The project staff will conduct accessibility assessments of their programs' physical and instructional environments. The project staff will eliminate physical and learn ing barriers in the educational settings and provide reasonable accommodations to those being served. The project staff will carefully consider issues of cultural diversity and sensitivity by reviewing instructional elements of the program. Careful attention to topics covered in the program will be considered based on how participants might respond, react, or perceive information being presented. The Arizona Department of Education shall maintain non- discriminatory learning environments to ensure that part icipants are not excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of or otherwise subjected to discrimination in any program or activity of the district on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability or national origin. The right o f any student to attend and participate in school activities will be limited only when the welfare of others may be threatened. When students act irresponsibly, they will be held accountable so as to preserve an appropriate educational setting for others. These provisions are supported in the proposal as well as in the Department's policies and rules supporting diversity.

Which school scenario should be considered? COVID-19 continuum of school learning scenarios PREPARING FOR SCHOOL YEAR 2020-2021 1. Health Protocol a. Screening b. Physical distancing c. Prompting behaviors that reduce spread d. Maintaining healthy environments e. Maintaining healthy operations f. Focus on mental health g. Preparing for when someone gets sick 2. Communications 3. Technology CONSIDERING SCHOOL COMMUNITY MEMBERS Page 4 5-9 10 11-25 26-28 29-31 3/3732-26 INTRODUCTION This document presents several strategies and considerations intended to provide public and private schools, local educational agencies (LEAs), guidance in preparing for and conducting a successful re-entry into School Year 2020-2021. Because experts are continuing to learn more about COVID-19 and the conditions surrounding the crisis are continually evolving, this guidance will likely change, be amended, or augmented. LEAs should coordinate with local authorities, such as state and local health departments, health centers, consulting physicians, and health-care providers, and apply this guidance in accordance with the guidance they receive from these stakeholders. LEAs should always adhere to the most recent recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These guidelines are not designed to be prescriptive but seek to provide LEAs with parameters and options as they develop their own contingency plans using local health trends and statewide data. Procedures outlined within this document are based on recommendations from federal and state resources, collaborative partners, and institutional best practices, and are not, unless otherwise indicated, required by statute or regulation. Some LEAs will not be able to address or implement all the strategies included. Each LEA should use this document as a guide and consult with district or school counsel and all relevant stakeholders to determine which procedures the LEA is able to address and the best way to proceed. This guide will be revised and updated regularly as more data and resources become available. WHAT THIS ROADMAP IS A guidance document Based on evidence and expertise Comprised of the essential actions designed to spur thinking, planning, and prioritization Part of a continuum of school decision making A fluid document that will change and grow based on local trends and statewide data WHAT THIS ROADMAP IS NOT Legal advice Based on opinion or ideology An exhaustive list of every action that a district or school leader will need to return to school A distance learning playbook or school closure guidance The final word on how LEAs and schools will manage the next phases of COVID-19 4/37DECIDING WHETHER TO RE-OPEN SHOULD THE SCHOOL REOPEN? Implementation (of CDC guidance) should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of each community. Schools may still provide in-person instruction as determined by their local governing board. All YesAll Yes A. Start from here Will reopening be consistent with applicable state and local orders? Is the school ready to protect children and employees at higher risk for severe illness? Are you able to screen students and employees upon arrival for symptoms and history of exposure? B. Are recommended health and safety actions in place? Promote healthy hygiene practices such as hand washing and employees wearing a cloth face covering, as feasible Intensify cleaning, disinfection, and ventilation Encourage social distancing through increased spacing, small groups and limited mixing between groups, if feasible Train all employees on health and safety protocols C. Is ongoing monitoring in place? Develop and implement procedures to check for signs and symptoms of students and employees daily upon arrival, as feasible Encourage anyone who is sick to stay home Plan for if students or employees get sick Regularly communicate and monitor developments with local authorities, employees, and families regarding cases, exposures, and updates to policies and procedures Monitor student and employee absences and have flexible leave policies and practices Be ready to consult with the local health authorities if there are cases in the facility or an increase in cases in the local area DO NOT OPEN MEET SAFEGUARDS FIRST OPEN & MONITOR Any No Any No Any NoAll Yes The guidelines, Schools Decision Tree , provided from CDC are intended to assist administrators in making reopening decisions regarding K-12 schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to check with state and local health officials, and other partners, to determine the most appropriate actions while adjusting to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. 6/37Yes YesNone -Minimal <10 cases/100,000 SCENARIO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED? The scenarios below come from the National Institute for Excellence in Teaching and are intended to be used as a guide for leaders as they design their plan for 2020-21. While this is not comprehensive, it captures key points of consideration as well as guiding questions for four different scenarios anticipated to be possible in the fall: The LEA meets the CDC School Decision Tree guidelines.

SCREENING CONTINUUM OF SCREENING When considering the ability to screen students and employees upon arrival for symptoms and history of exposure, LEAs can consider a continuum in order to ensure that staff and students do not come to school when ill. Through clearly communicating symptoms, which when evident, indicate that staff and students should stay home, LEAs can screen for illness before students enter the school building. THINGS TO CONSIDER Additional risk: for the school staff assigned to the role of health screener Adequate PPE: for the school staff assigned to the role of health screener in consideration of the risk posed by the personal contact Potential liability: if health screeners err or are negligent in determining who may attend or who must not attend Threshold conditions in writing for excluding someone from campus: to ensure consistency so that health screeners are never operating on their own discretion Privacy laws: health checks and screenings may trigger privacy laws including ferpa, hipaa and the ada. leas should consult with their counsel to ensure compliance with all applicable state and federal statutory requirements. Contact tracing protocol: when a student or staff member tests positive for or is exposed to covid 19 Any screening policy should take into account students with disabilities and accommodations that may be needed in the screening process for those students. 1st CONTINUUM HOME LEAs- Educate and support families on identifying the symptoms that indicate staff and students must stay at home. Families- Self-report* symptoms of illness (fever, new onset of cough, etc). *calling the school,or health-care provider, etc2nd CONTINUUM TRANSPORTATION LEAs- Use clearly visible signage to communicate the symptoms students should not have if traveling on a school bus. FINAL CONTINUUM SCHOOL LEA staff- Visually check for symptoms (which may include temperature checks) and/or confirm with families that students are COVID-19 symptom- free. Follow up with healthcare professional HEALTH PROTOCOLS 13/37 b. PHYSICAL DISTANCING Limiting the physical interactions of students is one way to mitigate exposure to infectious disease. LEAs should consider their ability to physically distance students to the extent possible. When it is not feasible to provide sufficient physical distance, LEAs should consider cloth face masks as a mitigation strategy. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends wearing cloth face coverings in settings where physical distancing measures are difficult to maintain. (Use of Cloth Face Coverings to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19 ) TRANSPORTATION Physical distancing on buses such as assigned seating for riders, the possibility of needing more buses, and alternative schedules to safely transport students. When physical distancing on buses is not possible, LEAs should consider cloth face masks and other mitigation strategies. Stagger arrival and drop-off times or locations by cohort or put into place other protocols, to limit contact between cohorts and direct contact with parents as much as possible.Particularly, consider staggered schedules for staff and students with disabilities or who are medically fragile. CLASSROOM SMALLER CLASSROOM SIZE - Decrease class sizes when possible to allow for more physical space between students in classroom setting. - Limit mixing between groups if possible. - Ensure smaller class sizes do not segregate students with disabilities from their non-disabled peers or change a student's special education placement. MODIFIED LAYOUT - Space seating/desks: CDC guideline: six feet apart when feasible - Assigned seating: to help track virus spread if a student/staff tests positive for COVID-19 - Turn desks to face in the same direction (rather than facing each other), or have students sit on only one side of tables, spaced apart. PHYSICAL BARRIERS - Install physical barriers: Sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least six feet apart (i.e., reception desks). - Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that staff and children remain at least six feet apart in lines and at other times (i.e., guides for creating \"one way routes\" in hallways). - Modified layouts should consider preschool center-based designs into consideration, where appropriate. HEALTH PROTOCOLS 14/37 f. FOCUSING ON MENTAL HEALTH HOME LEAs should educate and support families on identifying the indicators that signal staff and students are suffering from anxiety, depression, or lack of coping strategies. Families should be provided with resources and contact information for community mental health resources SCHOOL LEAs should ensure that all staff is trained on identifying the indicators that signal staff and students are suffering from anxiety, depression or lack of coping strategies. Staff should be provided with resources and contact information for community mental health resources. It is critical for LEAs to focus on the mental health and well-being of staff and students. Mental health concerns can be identified and supported both at home and at school, and it is important for LEAs to consider the mental health of its entire school community. SUPPORT COPING AND RESILIENCE Encourage employees and students to take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories about COVID-19, including social media if they are feeling overwhelmed or distressed. Promote employees and students eating healthy, exercising, getting sleep, and finding time to unwind. Encourage employees and students to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling. Ensure staff are educated on the signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression LEAs should leverage their school counselors and social workers to support staff and students.4 Ensure staff are familiar with resources through both the national Crisis Response Network and Arizona's Crisis Response Network (CRN). Post signages for local distress hotlines; national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUsto 66746 HEALTH PROTOCOLS 15/37 b. PHYSICAL DISTANCING (Continued) COMMUNAL SPACES Close communal use shared spaces such as dining halls and playgrounds with shared playground equipment if possible; otherwise, stagger use and clean and disinfect between use. Add physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, between bathroom sinks especially when they cannot be at least six feet apart. FOOD SERVICE Connect with food service leaders to plan for modifications in the meal service areas, where meals may be consumed, and to menus that will provide optimal nutrition benefits to students. Serve individually plated or home-packed meals in classrooms instead of in a communal dining hall or cafeteria, while ensuring the safety of children with food allergies. National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs participants: adopt processes that align with federal requirements, and consider the availability of and access to meals if school is not in session or if implementing distance learning. Use disposable food service items (i.e., utensils, dishes). If disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items. Food service staff are required to have standard operating procedures that ensure safe and effective handling of all food service-related equipment. These procedures should be reviewed, and staff retrained, as needed. If food is offered at any event, including classroom celebrations, have pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee instead of a buffet or family-style meal. Avoid sharing food and utensils and ensure the safety of children with food allergies. Consider establishing protocols for when cloth masks are removed to consume food (i.e., proper storage). Use flexible worksites (i.e., telework) and flexible work hours (i.e., staggered shifts) if possible to help establish policies and practices for physical distancing (maintaining distance of approximately six feet) between employees and others, especially if physical distancing is recommended by state and local health authorities. WHEN PHYSICAL DISTANCING IS NOT POSSIBLE Implement other mitigation strategies, such as cloth face masks, hand washing, and sanitization. This will be especially pertinent for bus aides, paraprofessionals working with students with disabilities, or in any case where physical contact is required HEALTH PROTOCOLS 16/37 c. PROMOTING BEHAVIORS THAT REDUCE SPREAD STAYING HOME WHEN APPROPRIATE Educate staff and families when they/their child(ren) should stay home and when they can return to school Actively encourage employees and students who are sick or who have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19 to stay home. Develop policies that encourage sick employees and students to stay at home without fear of reprisal, and ensure employees, students, and students' families are aware of these policies. Discourage perfect attendance awards, not assessing schools based on absenteeism, and offering virtual learning and telework options, if feasible. Reduce or eliminate exclusionary disciplinary action as students have already experienced significant lack of services, educational opportunities, and isolation during school closure. Consider that students and staff who are immunocompromised or disabled, or have family members who are immunocompromised or disabled, may not feel safe attending school in person. Staff and students should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms. Staff and students who have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should also stay home and monitor their health. ADHS criteria can help inform when employees and students should return to work: HAND HYGIENE AND RESPIRATORY ETIQUETTE Each and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and increase monitoring to ensure adherence among students and staff. Hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol can be used (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer)if soap and water are not readily available. Encourage staff and students to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash, and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Consider any additional staff or supply resource that may be necessary to assist students who have physical or emotional disabilities with proper handwashing techniques, or alternatives to handwashing if practical. HEALTH PROTOCOLS 17/37 c. PROMOTING BEHAVIORS THAT REDUCE SPREAD (Continued) HEALTH PROTOCOLS CLOTH FACE COVERINGS Teach and reinforce use of cloth face coverings. Face coverings may be challenging for students (especially younger students) to wear in all-day settings such as school. Face coverings should be worn by staff and students (particularly older students), as feasible, and are most essential in times when physical distancing is difficult. Individuals should be frequently reminded not to touch the face covering and to wash their hands frequently. Information should be provided to staff, students, and students' families on proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings. Provide families with instructions on how to wear, sanitize, and properly maintain cloth face coverings. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on: - Children younger than two years old - Anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious - Anyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cloth face covering without assistance - Students with certain disabilities or health conditions Cloth face coverings are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. They are not surgical masks, respirators, or other medical personal protective equipment. They should be washed routinely depending on frequency of use. A washing machine should suffice in adequately cleaning cloth face coverings. LEAs should consider that not all families have access to washing machines and should have alternatives in place in order to equitably promote the health and wellness of all students. They are not medical grade Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and medical grade PPE should be utilized instead of cloth face coverings in cases where medical care is being provided to a patient with COVID-19 symptoms in a school setting. LEAs will want to determine policies and procedures regarding cloth face coverings and will want to clearly communicate these with students and families. This could include protocols for acquiring cloth face coverings. ADEQUATE SUPPLIES Support healthy hygiene behaviors by providing adequate supplies, including soap, hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer), paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, cloth face coverings (as feasible) and no-touch/foot-pedal trash cans. Identify staff who will need cloth face coverings or PPE based on the additional risk of physical contact due to their positions, including health service providers, related services providers, paraeducators, bus drivers, etc. 18/37 c. PROMOTING BEHAVIORS THAT REDUCE SPREAD (Continued) SIGNS AND MESSAGES Post signs in highly visible locations (i.e., school entrances, restrooms) that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spread of germs, such as by properly washing hands and properly wearing a cloth face covering. Broadcast regular announcements on reducing the spread of COVID-19 on PA systems. Include messages (i.e., videos) about behaviors that prevent the spread of COVID-19 when communicating with staff and families, such as on school websites, in emails, and on school social media accounts. Find free CDC print and digital resources on CDC's communication resources main page. Some ADHS Resources - Stop the Spread of Germs - Know the Symptoms of COVID-19 Use consistent messaging across all schools. Feeder schools when developing messaging, so that students are seeing the same messaging across families. The home language of students and families when posting signs and sending messages. Provide messages in alternative formats to successfully communicate information to individuals whose primary language is not English, and to individuals with hearing or vision impairment. Communicate in multiple modalities to ensure that students and families without internet connectivity are included and receive the same important information as is communicated to all families. HEALTH PROTOCOLS 19/37 d. MAINTAINING HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS CLEANING AND DISINFECTION Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (i.e., playground equipment, door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains) within the school and on school buses at least daily or between use as much as possible. Use of shared objects (i.e., gym or physical education equipment, art supplies, toys, games) should be limited when possible, or cleaned between use. If transport vehicles (i.e., buses) are used by the school, drivers should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other staff (i.e., hand hygiene, cloth face coverings). To clean and disinfect school buses or other transport vehicles, see guidance for bus transit operators. Develop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning, and disinfection. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection products, including storing products securely away from children. Use products that meet the EPA disinfection criteria. Cleaning products should not be used near children, and staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent children or themselves from inhaling toxic fumes. SHARED OBJECTS Discourage sharing of items that are difficult to clean or disinfect. Keep each child's belongings separated from others' and in individually labeled containers, cubbies, or areas. Ensure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high touch materials to the extent possible (i.e., assigning each student their own art supplies, equipment), or limit use of supplies and equipment by one group of children at a time and clean and disinfect between use. Avoid sharing electronic devices, toys, books, and other games or learning aids. VENTILATION Ensure ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible, for example by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (i.e., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to children using the facility. WATER SYSTEMS To minimize the risk of Legionnaire's disease and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (i.e., sink faucets, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. Drinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized. Encourage staff and students to bring their own water to minimize use and touching of water fountains. HEALTH PROTOCOLS 20/37 e. MAINTAINING HEALTHY OPERATIONS PROTECTIONS FOR STAFF AND CHILDREN AT HIGHER RISK FOR SEVERE ILLNESS FROM COVID-19 Offer options for staff at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions or disabilities) that limit their exposure risk (i.e., telework, modified job responsibilities that limit exposure risk). Offer options for students at higher risk of severe illness that limit their exposure risk (i.e., virtual learning opportunities). Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) should be utilized instead of cloth face coverings in cases where medically fragile staff or students are in physical school buildings. Consistent with applicable law, put in place policies to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding underlying medical conditions. REGULATORY AWARENESS Be aware of local, tribal, or state regulatory agency restrictions related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held. GATHERINGS, VISITORS, FIELD TRIPS Pursue virtual group events, gatherings, or meetings, if possible, and promote physical distancing of at least six feet between people if events are held. Limit group size to the extent possible. Limit any nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving external groups or organizations as possible, especially with individuals who are not from the local geographic area (i.e., community, town, city, county). Pursue virtual activities and events in lieu of field trips, student assemblies, special performances, school-wide parent meetings, and spirit nights, as possible. Pursue options to convene sporting events and participation in sports activities in ways that minimizes the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to players, families, coaches, and communities. IDENTIFYING SMALL GROUPS AND KEEPING THEM TOGETHER (COHORTING) Ensure that student and staff groupings are as static as possible by having the same group of children stay together and with the same staff (all day for young children, and as much as possible for older children). Limit mixing between groups if possible. DESIGNATED COVID-19 POINT OF CONTACT Designate a staff person to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns (i.e., school nurse). All school staff and families should know who this person is and how to contact them. HEALTH PROTOCOLS 21/37 e. MAINTAINING HEALTHY OPERATIONS (Continued) PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY RESPONSE EFFORTS Consider participating with local authorities in broader COVID-19 community response efforts (i.e., sitting on community response committees). COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS Put systems in place for: - Consistent with applicable law and privacy policies, having staff and families self-report to the school if they or their student have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days in accordance with health information sharing regulations for COVID-19 external icon (see \"Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts\" in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below) and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and confidentiality, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). - Notifying staff, families, and the public of school closures and any restrictions in place to limit COVID-19 exposure (i.e., limited hours of operation). - Communicating with staff and families if there is an exposure at school. Ensure signs and messaging are provided in alternative formats to successfully communicate information to individuals whose primary language is not English, and to individuals with hearing or vision impairment. LEAVE (TIME OFF) POLICIES AND EXCUSED ABSENCE POLICIES Implement flexible sick leave policies and practices that enable staff to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, or caring for someone who is sick. Examine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation. Leave policies should be flexible and not punish people for taking time off and should allow sick employees to stay home and away from co-workers. Leave policies should also account for employees who need to stay home with their children if there are school or childcare closures, or to care for sick family members. Develop policies for return-to-school after COVID-19 illness. CDC's criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies. LEAs should consult with counsel to ensure planned procedures comply with applicable laws, including the FLSA and the ADA. HEALTH PROTOCOLS 22/37 e. MAINTAINING HEALTHY OPERATIONS (Continued) STAFF TRAINING Train staff on all safety protocols. Conduct training virtually or ensure that physical distancing is maintained during training. BACK-UP STAFFING PLAN Monitor absenteeism of students and employees, cross-train staff, and create a roster of trained back-up staff. RECOGNIZE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS If feasible, conduct daily health checks (i.e., symptom checking, which could include temperature screening) of staff and students. Health checks should be conducted safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations. School administrators may use examples of screening methods in CDC's supplemental Guidance for Child Care Programs that Remain Open as a guide for screening children and CDC's General Business FAQs for screening staff. SHARING FACILITIES Encourage any organizations that share or use the school facilities to also follow these considerations. HEALTH PROTOCOLS 23/37 g. PREPARING FOR WHEN SOMEONE GETS SICK ADVISE STAFF AND FAMILIES OF SICK STUDENTS OF HOME ISOLATION CRITERIA Sick staff members or students should not return until they have met CDC's criteria to discontinue home isolation. Collaborate with Tribal Nations to determine the best ways for multi-generational families will isolate to prevent further spread of disease. ISOLATE THOSE WHO ARE SICK Make sure that staff and families know that they (staff) or their children (families) should not come to school, and that they should notify school officials (the designated COVID-19 point of contact) if they (staff) or their child (families) become sick with COVID-19 symptoms, test positive for COVID-19, or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case. Immediately separate staff and children with COVID-19 symptoms (such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath) at school. Individuals who are sick should go home or to a healthcare facility depending on how severe their symptoms are, and follow CDC guidance for caring for oneself and others who are sick. Work with school administrators, nurses, and other healthcare providers to identify an isolation room or area to separate anyone who has COVID-19 symptoms or tests positive but does not have symptoms. School nurses and other healthcare providers should use Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions when caring for sick people. See: What Healthcare Personnel Should Know About Caring for Patients with Confirmed or Possible COVID-19 Infection. LEAs should work with their local health department in determining what PPE and supplies should be available in school health offices. LEAs who do not have site-based school nurses, should work with their local health department to determine protocols for caring for students who are sick. LEAs should consult with counsel to ensure planned procedures comply with applicable privacy law and the ADA. CLEAN AND DISINFECT Close off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting. Wait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection products, including storing products securely away from children. HEALTH PROTOCOLS 24/37 g. PREPARING FOR WHEN SOMEONE GETS SICK (Continued) NOTIFY HEALTH OFFICIALS AND CLOSE CONTACTS In accordance with state and local laws and regulations, school administrators should notify local health officials, staff, and families immediately of any case of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) external icon. - LEAs should confer with local health officials to determine what other entities/LEAs should be notified and who will make notification. Inform those who have had close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home and self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop. Ensure communication systems and messaging are provided in alternative formats to successfully communicate information to individuals whose primary language is not English and individuals with hearing or vision impairment. *LEAs that do not have medical staff onsite, should consult their local health departments for guidance and support with implementing health considerations related to COVID-19. HEALTH PROTOCOLS 25/37 2. Communications 26/37 DEVELOPING PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS Effective and ongoing communications is a critical component before, during, and after any school crisis. Implementing specific communication procedures and protocols will allow staff, students, families, and the community to safely re-engage in the education process. DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATIONS PROCEDURE Who (or which department) will issue information to audiences? Is there a clear central point of contact? What are the central and supporting messages? Is the central message tied to student safety? When will information will be shared? Have school employees been notified prior to releasing information? How will the information be reaching primary audiences? QUESTIONS TO ASK TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION METHOD Is all vital information shared at one time to reduce confusion? Is all information in a central website? Are the communications accessible to families where English is not the primary language spoken at home? Are the communications accessible to persons with hearing and/or visual impairment? Are the communications accessible to communities without internet access? Is there consistent messaging across schools in an LEA, and across feeder schools? Do you have input from other stakeholders to provide consistent and factual messaging? - Tribal Nations and additional community groups, to ensure that communication is culturally sensitive and appropriate. - Community agencies - Local government - Chamber of Commerce - Health-related groups, including the local health department on appropriate safety protocols - Higher education COMMUNICATIONS 27/37 COMMUNICATION SHOULD INCLUDE: FOR PARENTS/GUARDIANS Start dates for protocols and programs Information on the LEA's health and safety measures for studentS Clear expectations for parents and students during Emergency Distance Learning Clear direction on when to keep a student home, and the process for notifying the school Reminders on mandatory immunizations, and location information on where they can be obtained Information on trauma informed practices DHS Fact Sheet: Basic information on COVID-19 and measures families can take to stay safe when not at school Helping Children Cope with Changes Resulting from COVID-19 : Information on helping children cope with stress and tragedies TO STUDENTS IN SCHOOL FACILITIES Posters in all buildings on hand washing and covering coughs and sneezes Posters at entryways not to enter the school if experiencing signs of illness Ensure consistent messaging across schools in an LEA Collaborate with feeder schools when developing messaging to ensure that students in the same family are receiving the same messaging. TO THE PUBLIC Post reminders at entryways not to enter the school if experiencing signs of illness. COMMUNICATIONS 28/37 3. Technology 29/37 EMPHASIS ON CONNECTIVITY WITH AWARENESS OF CHANGING NEED LEAs should place specific emphasis on connectivity, computing devices, and management and instructional platforms while bearing in mind that supports, approaches and resources may evolve as information or needs change. COMPUTING DEVICES & CONNECTIVITY Assess students' at-home access and plan for additional device and connectivity access as needed. - Work to procure access for the students/staff with limited or no connectivity. Consider that some students are in a home with multiple children who need access to a single computing device to complete schoolwork Consider leveraging community resources to secure computer devices/connectivity for students and teachers. - Non-profits, city/county/state/tribal governments or consortiums, and business and industry partners. To the extent possible, provide students with individual computers or tablets with accessories sufficient to participate in video classrooms. - Provide each household with the hardware and WiFi access (hotspots) necessary to provide consistent internet with adequate speeds. Make budget adjustments or leverage COVID19 federal funding, to purchase computer devices and address internet connectivity issues. Work with ADE's State E-Rate Coordinator to problem solve connectivity issues. Consider working with countywide consortia to utilize cost effective solutions for connectivity. Consider student and teacher familiarity with device and provide appropriate support or staff to ensure navigation of features. To the extent possible, refine checkout systems for the collection and dispersal of donated equipment. - Provide specific accommodations for logistical issues affecting student/staff. MOBILE DEVICE MANAGEMENT, INSTRUCTIONAL, AND COMMUNICATION PLATFORMS To the extent possible, provide uniform platforms based on standards necessary for virtual work, teaching/learning and communication. Provide language services to ensure effective communications with students, parents in their home languages, including learning tools. Create a plan for parents with limited English proficiency to meaningfully participate in their child's education and provide opportunity for questions and feedback (e.g., a combination of live interpretation from an interpreter, written interpretation, and high-quality translation apps) Learning Management Systems Considerations: - Integration with blended learning models - Registration and tracking of student progress - Parental/Guardian access to monitor progress - Sustain learning opportunities by curating and delivering digital content promoting active / continuous learning and active engagement - Flexibility for specific areas of instruction for all students (Early Learners, Exceptional & Physical Education, etc.) TECHNOLOGY 30 30/37 EMPHASIS ON CONNECTIVITY WITH AWARENESS OF CHANGING NEEDS (Continued) Security procedures and protocols as students transition to online tests and graded assignments. Consider a plan that provides flexible means of accessing professional learning resources and support for staff. To the extent possible, monitor, manage, and secure all employee and student mobile devices (laptops, tablets, etc.) STUDENT/FAMILY SUPPORT AND PRIVACY & SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS To the extent possible, provide multiple opportunities for support including office hours, helplines or help desks taking into consideration those students, families and staff with special needs or language barriers. Consider a plan where iterative improvement occur as efficiently as possible by ensuring robust lines of communication between students, families, educators, and leaders who continuously identify and share areas of success and need. Consider ways to implement technical assistance for parents who do not have technical language or skills to navigate a device or learning software platform. Ensure the ability to maintain student privacy and security for safety, while complying with LEA policies, state and federal laws. COMPUTER LABS AND CARTS To the extent possible, follow physical distancing guidelines, disinfecting/sanitizing and/or non-sharing of devices and equipment for all instructional technology classrooms/labs and office spaces. Develop clear daily cleaning protocols , determine appropriate cleaning products, and determine implications for staff. Create signage, visuals, and markings to communicate student expectations.
