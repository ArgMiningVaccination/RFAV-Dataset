However, it is unclear whether the details of ICWM interventions, such as selection rationale, implement design and potential interactions, were adequately reported. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the quality of reporting in the ICWM interventional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of UC, and to identify the common problems if any. Methods Through a search of 10 international electronic databases, we identi\u0000ed RCTs of UC with ICWM interventions published in English or Chinese up to 23 February 2022. The general characteristics of included studies were described. The quality of reporting was assessed according to three checklists, including the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) with 36 items (except for one item 1b about abstract), the CONSORT for Abstracts (17 items), and a self-designed ICWM-related checklist (27 items covering design rationale, intervention details, outcome assessments and analysis). The reporting scores of RCTs published before and after 2010 were compared. Results A total of 1,335 eligible RCTs were included. For the reporting compliance, the median score (interquartile ranges) of the CONSORT (72 score in total), the CONSORT for Abstract (34 score), and ICWM-related (54 score) items was 29 (26-33), 18 (14-21), and 13 (11-15), respectively. In addition, more than 50% items were evaluated as poor quality (reporting rate<50%) among each checklist. Time period comparisons showed that reporting quality of included publications improved signifcantly after the CONSORT 2010 issued (P<0.01). Conclusion Although CONSORT appears to have enhanced the reporting of RCTs in UC, the quality of ICWM speci\u0000cs is variable and in need of improvement. Reporting guideline of the ICWM recommendations should be developed thus to improve their quality. Introduction Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a global disease, the incidence and prevalence of which have increased in several regions of the world 1, 2. As an immune-mediated chronic in\u0000ammatory bowel disease, UC isPage 4/28characterized by continuous and super\u0000cial in\u0000ammation of the colon. However, its etiology and pathogenesis have not yet been determined and are generally considered to be in\u0000uenced by genetic, environmental and microbial factors 3. The treatment goal of UC is to achieve symptomatic relief, endoscopic healing, normalization of serum and fecal markers, absence of disability, restoration of quality of life, and normal growth in children 4. Conventional treatments control symptoms through pharmacotherapy, including aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics, with other general measures or surgical resection if necessary 5. Aminosalicylates are known to be the \u0000rst-line treatment option for mild to moderate UC 6, but they may cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea 7, 8. Corticosteroids is a kind of treatment selection for UC patients who have inadequate response to mesalazine, however, their long-term treatment is not recommended due to signi\u0000cant adverse effects such as an increased risk of mortality, infection, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and osteoporosis 7, 9. Immunomodulators and biologics are bene\u0000cial to patients with moderate to severe disease activity, corticosteroid dependence, or those at high risk of colectomy, but up to 74% UC patients may lose response over time 10. Limitations such as inadequate response, side effects, dependence, and drug resistance to Western medicine (WM) remain to be solved 11, 12. Chinese medicine (CM), a medical system based on distinctive Chinese cultural theories and practices, has been increasingly introduced into the treatment of UC, especially in Asia 13. CM treatment mainly includes Chinese herbal formula (oral or rectal), acupuncture and moxibustion. Due to its multi-targeted mode of action, CM has unique advantages for treating in\u0000ammatory bowel diseases, including maintain intestinal integrity, reduce in\u0000ammation, and decrease oxidative stress, with minor side effects 14. With the extensive studies on UC in recent years, it is con\u0000rmed that both CM and WM have unique advantages in UC management. In China, most patients of UC preferred Integrated Chinese and Western medicine (ICWM) therapy over CM or WM alone. Several reviews supported the promising effect and few side effects of ICWM for UC 15, 16, but most of the included trials had high risk of bias and major methodological de\u0000ciencies, including insu\u0000cient description of randomization process, lacking appropriate therapeutic end points, and missing power calculations. Although the quality of reporting in RCTs in medical sciences has been discussed, the quality of reporting in RCTs on the treatment of UC with ICWM has not yet been assessed after publication of the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 Statement. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the details of ICWM interventions, such as selection rationale, indications and timing of interventions, implement design and potential interactions, were adequately reported in current randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Therefore, this study aimed to assess the quality of reporting in RCTs of ICWM for UC, based on the checklists of CONSORT 2010 17 and a self-designed ICWM-speci\u0000c checklist. Materials And MethodsPage 5/28Eligibility criteria This study included ICWM interventional RCTs of UC published in English or Chinese up to 23 February 2022. We included studies on subjects given the diagnosis of UC de\u0000ned by clear diagnostic criteria or references, regardless of age, gender, course of disease and severity. The ICWM intervention is de\u0000ned as the combination of CM therapies and WM treatments. Speci\u0000cally, we included a wide range of CM interventions, such as herbal medicines, acupuncture and moxibustion, while only pharmacological therapy of WM in the intervention group. There were no limitations in the types of control groups and the assessed outcomes. Repeat publications, non-randomized or non-controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials, non-ICWM interventional trials, study protocols, reviews, observational studies, case reports, abstracts or full-text reports not found, non-human studies, and non-English or non-Chinese language reports were excluded. Search Strategy A systematic search was conducted on 23 February 2022 for the following databases: Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of science, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Service System, Wanfang Data and VIP Chinese Medical Journal Database. The search terms were \"ulcerative detailed search strategy is presented in Appendix 1. Study Selection Four review authors (JLZ, NNW, FL, and PJC) independently screened titles and abstracts of the retrieved records based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full reports of any potentially relevant papers were reviewed and double-checked for further assessment of eligibility. Differences of opinion were settled by consensus. Data Extraction We developed a data extraction form to extract data on general characteristics of included records, including study title, publication year and language, information of corresponding author(s), types of journals, types of study design (e.g., assignment, randomization, blinding, sample size and participating centers), features of interventions, types of participant(s) and control(s), period of treatment and follow- up (if any), as well as the categories of diagnosis criteria, outcome(s) and study conclusions. We piloted the extraction form on a random sample of ten included articles and achieved consistency in data item interpretations. Then, four trained authors (JLZ, FL, NNW, and JSD) independently extracted the data, and another two review authors (XZ and JW) conducted a second check. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.Page 6/28Reporting Quality Assessment The reporting quality of included studies was evaluated according to a standard checklist of the CONSORT 2010 statement, of which the checklist of the CONSORT for Abstract was extracted for independent evaluation. For rating the CONSORT items, the assessment rules were referred to the CONSORT 2010 statement (including the CONSORT for Abstract) with its explanation and elaboration document which provides the de\u0000nitions and rationale for each checklist item and examples of good reporting (e.g., scored as 2 points) 17, 18. The total score of the CONSORT checklist and CONSORT for abstract checklist was 72 and 34, respectively. A special-designed checklist comprised of 27 items related to speci\u0000c characteristics of ICWM trials (Table 1) was developed by \u0000ve researchers (XZ, JL, PW, FH and ZXB) based on an internal discussion. This list focused on the identi\u0000cation of critical issues in the procedure of ICWM design, implement and assessment, particular in the selection rationale, details of therapy combination, and the e\u0000cacy assessment. Each item/question was scored in terms of total score of ICWM-speci\u0000c checklist was 54. For rating the ICWM items, the details of scoring rules are presented in Appendix 2 which includes the explanations for each question and examples of eligible reporting. The quality assessment was independently conducted by one review author and veri\u0000ed by another review author. A total of four authors (YHW, JSD, NNW and WTC) participated the quality assessment. Possible disagreements were resolved with the consultation of the third senior review authors (XZ or ZXB).Page 7/28Table 1 Questions for assessing the reporting of ICWM-speci\u0000c items Item no.Speci\u0000cs Q1 Whether the feature of ICWM was presented in the section of \"Title\" (e.g., generalized term of ICWM, or speci\u0000c CM and WM interventions provided in the title)?

Integrative Chinese and Western medicine (ICWM); Chinese medicine (CM); Western medicine (WM) Data analysis We applied frequency and percentage to present categorical variables, and mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range, IQR) to present continuous variables. For individual item of reporting quality, the compliance rate was calculated with the number of items acquired \"2\" based on the total number of included reports, which was further categorized as three levels: excellent compliance (>90%), good compliance (between 65% and 90%), and poor compliance (<65%). The total scores of the CONSORT, CONSORT for Abstract and ICWM-speci\u0000c checklists of RCTs published before and after 2010 were compared with Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Statistics analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 28.0). Statistical signi\u0000cance was de\u0000ned as two-sided P value<0.05. Results Literature search The \u0000owchart of the selection and screening process is shown in Fig. 1. Brie\u0000y, the electronic search yielded 8,760 records, after removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, a total of 1,648 reports were identi\u0000ed for the full-text assessment. Finally, we included 1,335 eligible RCTs for analysis, of which 1,262 articles with abstract and 37 without abstracts.Page 9/28Characteristics Of Included Trials A total of 1,335 RCTs of ICWM for UC were included between Jan 1998 to Feb 2022. The number of these studies increased gradually during the \u0000rst 10 years, and then presented a rapid increase starting from 2009 (Fig. 2). The most common design of included studies was a single center (97.9%), two parallel arms (93.7%), sample size of 51-100 (70.1%), Chinese herbal formula (94.2%) as CM treatment, and intervention period within 30 days (48.9%). There were 470 (35.2%) studies applied CM diagnosis when recruited UC participants, while only 263 (19.7%) adopted CM-related outcomes to assess the e\u0000cacy of treatments. Around 98.5% (1,315) trials concluded a con\u0000rmed e\u0000cacy of ICWM for UC. However, the missing reporting is common for several critical aspects, such as 97.9% trials did not whether adopt blinding or not, and 75.5% trials did not specify the studied phase(s) of UC (e.g., active, remission, or both).

Reporting Completeness And Features The results of adherence to the CONSORT, the CONSORT for Abstract, and ICWM-speci\u0000c checklist items are presented in Table 3, 4, and 5. For the completeness of the CONSORT checklist, the median (IQR) reporting score was 29 (26-33). Speci\u0000cally, the reporting quality was excellent (>90%) in 8 (2a, 6b, 11b, 12b, 14b, items (4b, 5, 13a and 17a, 17b, 20, 21, 23, 24 and 25). For the CONSORT for Abstract, the reporting score was 18 (14-21). The quality of reporting was excellent (>90%) in 3 items (3, 6 and 15); good (65-90%) in 1 item (10); and poor (<65%) in 13 items (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17).Page 14/28Table 3 Reporting assessment of included studies based on the CONSORT and ICWM-speci\u0000c items (n=1,335) Section/topic Item number reported Title and abstract1a. the title13 (0.97)- 1,322 (99.03) 1b.

The total scores of the CONSORT, thePage 21/28CONSORT for Abstract, and ICWM-speci\u0000c checklist items were signi\u0000cantly improved after 2010 (all P< 0.01; Table 6).

Discussion ICWM has been widely applied for UC in China 16. There have been a large number of ICWM RCTs of UC published in Chinese and English literature. This study provides a scoping review of reporting quality of the RCTs of ICWM for UC publications between Jan 1998 to Feb 2022. Unfortunately, the reporting quality we reviewed was suboptimal and substantial improvement could be required to meet the recommendations of reporting guidelines. Based on the CONSORT checklist, the items with good reporting in the included articles cover scienti\u0000c background and rationale; settings and locations where the data were collected, intervention details; baseline demographic and clinical characteristics; and interpretation consistent with results. Although subgroup analysis showed better reporting quality after CONSORT checklist updated in 2010, this review demonstrated that there is much room for improvement in respect of ICWM RCTs reporting. The inadequate reporting domains of reviewed articles include title and abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and other information. In respect of title and abstract, the reporting percentage for \"identi\u0000cation as a randomized trial in the title\" of the trials was only 0.97%. Most Chinese articles did not report this item. Indexers may not classify a report as a RCT if the authors do not explicitly report this information, therefore limiting the accessibility 19. Contact details for the corresponding author was reported in 13.79% trials. Inadequate contact information would restrict readers to contact trialists for additional information or clari\u0000cations of reported data 20. Among 1,262 (94.5%) RCTs with abstract, thePage 22/28reporting quality was good in the description of the trial design, objective, number of participants randomized, and results in the section of \"Abstract\". However, the overall quality of abstract reporting has been unsatisfactory, presenting the inadequate reporting of participants, interventions, outcome, randomization, blinding, recruiting objects, outcome, harms, trial registration, and funding. Regarding introduction, there was only 1/3 studies reported speci\u0000c objectives or hypotheses. The majority of included trials had poor reporting in methods, including trial design, outcomes, sample size estimation, allocation concealment, implementation, blinding, and statistical methods. In results section, losses and exclusions after randomization, periods of recruitment and follow-up, precise outcomes, and adverse events were also poorly reported. Limitations, generalizability, registration, protocol and funding reporting had much room for improvement. There are the major reasons why the total score of CONSORT checklist was suboptimal. Similar problems were found in the previous study examining systematic reviews of ICWM 21. Due to the speci\u0000c characteristics of ICWM interventions, the ICWM-speci\u0000c checklist was designed to assess the reporting features of ICWM trials, which mainly focused on the rationale, implement and assessment, details of therapy combination and the e\u0000cacy assessment. According to the subgroup analysis, we found that the reporting quality in ICWM-speci\u0000c items was enhanced after 2010. However, there were several problems in the ICWM reporting. First of all, the rationale or reason of choosing ICWM interventions were reported in less than 20% studies. Secondly, the diagnostic criteria and outcome assessments of both CM and WM were rarely adopted simultaneously. Additionally, limited trials had reported speci\u0000c situations (e.g., treatment points, stages of diseases, types of conditions) for the applicable scope of ICWM, settings and locations where the trials were conducted, the background of treatment providers, measures to improve compliance, reasons for study design, interpretation of ICTM interventions, and con\u0000icts of interests. There was also no study provided information about participants exposed to ICWM treatment prior to recruitment and external validity of ICWM. Though 98.5% studies concluded promising e\u0000cacy of ICWM for UC, above problems not only limit the repeatability and reproducibility of the \u0000ndings, hamper other researchers to identify gaps that need to be addressed in the design and reporting of future studies, but also mislead healthcare providers in suggesting treatment decisions for patients. Given the de\u0000ciencies of reporting identi\u0000ed during this review, strengthen the reporting of the CONSORT are urgently needed. Besides, an extension for ICWM speci\u0000cs of the CONSORT would be worthy considered to improve the current situation. In this study, we found several problems in the characteristics of included RCTs. Firstly, only 4.6% articles published in relatively high-quality journals, such as the Chinese Medical Core Journals and English journals with impact factors. These journals usually provide peer review process, to assess the validity, quality and often the originality of articles for publication 22. Secondly, the most common design was single center (97.9%) and sample size of 51-100 (70.1%), indicating high-quality ICWM interventional RCTs with multicenter design and larger sample size are needed. Thirdly, the intervention period of no more than 30 days was applied in half of the studies. However, whether such short intervention period for UC was enough for obtaining maximum effectiveness is unknown. Moreover, 84.1% studies did notPage 23/28reported the follow-up period, therefore the long-term effectiveness of ICWM is questionable 23. Finally, more than two thirds (75.7%) of the trials did not report the speci\u0000c stages or phases of UC. TCM treatment strategies for in\u0000ammatory bowel diseases are based on disease gradation, stage, and segmentation from multi-dimensional treatment, including etiology, symptoms, syndromes, and internal and external treatment 24. Chinese medical syndromes of active and remission stage of UC are signi\u0000cantly different 25. Omit syndrome differentiation in Chinese medicine intervention may lead to unsuccessful treatment 26. Our study has some limitations. First, this review identi\u0000ed full-text RCTs of UC with ICWM interventions published up to 23 February 2022 in the targeted databases. Any records which had not been included in these databases by that cut-off period, or without available full-text have not been included. In addition, we included only articles in English and Chinese because of language limitations. As such, we may not have captured otherwise eligible trials published in other languages. Second, we rated the items with \"not applicable\" reporting as \"2\", which might overoptimizes the total scores. Furthermore, the CONSORT checklist is not intended to construct a \"quality score\". Thus, using scores based on the reporting checklists might limit the accuracy of our evaluations and simplify the actual situation. Third, methodology quality (e.g., risk of bias) assessment was not conducted because this review only focused on the reporting quality. Conclusion The reporting quality of ICWM RCTs for UC is suboptimal and substantial improvement is required to meet CONSORT guidelines. In consistent with previous studies 27-29, this study found improved reporting quality in reviewed RCTs after the CONSORT checklist updated in 2010. We suggest that authors should adhere to the CONSORT 2010 statement in designing, conducting, and reporting RCTs, and that researchers should consider developing a series of standard reporting items speci\u0000cally relevant to ITCWM design, as an extension to the CONSORT. This might be an effective strategy to achieving the improvement needed 30.
