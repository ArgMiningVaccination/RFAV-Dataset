ACTPP_flast.indd 10 9/27/11 3:33 PMBLANK PAGE CHAPTER1 ACT STUDY SKILLS AND TEST- TAKING STRATEGIES The advice in this chapter will help you set up an effective learn- ing environment and create a successful study plan. You will also learn important study strategies and test-taking tips. Part 1: Study Skills You probably feel as though you have spent practically your entire life studying, so why do you need to learn how to study for the ACT test? The ACT is different from any other test you have ever taken. Not only is it lon-ger and more important, but multisubject, standardized tests require a unique form of preparation. You certainly do not have to scrap all the good study habits you have already learned, but you will most like ly need to adapt them to the specics of the ACT. You may already be using some of the techniques found in this chapter, but now is a good time to re-evaluate your study habits and tailor them specically to the ACT. While studying for the ACT, you will also learn which study habits do not work and be able to eliminate waste d study time. Remember that the more effective your study habits, the less time you will spend studying and the more free time you will have to do what you really enjoy. 1 - - ACT STUDY SKILLS AND TE ST-TAKING STRATEGIES Study Environment and Attitude The Right Mood It will probably be tough to carve out extra time to study for the ACT on top of your regular schoolwork, your extracurricular activities, and your social life. These reasons may even lead you to procrastinate, but procrastinating can cause lots of trouble at test time. If you procrastinate too much or for too long, you will not be prepared for the exam. One of the best ways to beat procrastination is to use a r eward system. We all like to be rewarded for a job well done. If we know there is going to be a reward at the end of our work, it is easier to get started. So promise yourself a small reward for each study session. For example, you might promise yourself an hour of watching TV or playing video games as a reward for an hour of study. You might promise to treat yourself to a movie or a new CD after you nish a chapter in a test-prep book. Get your parents involved with your reward plan and maybe they will provide some rewards of their own. Remember, your attitude is important. It can dramatical ly affect how much you learn and how well you learn it. Make sure that you have a positive atti-tude. You will study, you will learn, and you will do wel l. Your study time will be time well spent. The Right Conditions You can have the best attitude in the world, but if you are t ired or distracted, you are going to have difculty studying. To be at your best, you need to be focused, alert, and calm. That means you need to study under the right conditions. Everyone is different, so you need to know what condit ions work best for you. Here are eight questions to consider: 1.W hat time of day do you work best\u2014morning , aft er noon, or evening? How early in the day o r lat e in the night can you think clearl y? 2.D o you work best in total silence? Or do y ou p re fer music or other noise in the backgr ound?3.I f you prefer music, what kind? Classical m usic o fte n helps people relax because the m usic is so ft and there are no words. But you may prefe r m usic that energizes you. Others work b est w ith music that has special meaning to the m and pu ts them in a positive state of mind. 4.W here do you like to work? Do you fee l most c omf ortable sitting at the kitchen counter? A t the dining r oom table? At a desk in your bed- room? (Try to avoid studying in bed. You wil l p ro bably be relaxed, but you may be too com- fortable and fall asleep.) Or do you prefer t o st udy ou t of the house, in the library or a lo cal c offee sho p? 5.W hat do you like to have around you when y ou w or k? Do you feel most comfortable in y our fa vorite chair? Do you like to have pictures o f famil y and friends ar ound? 6.W hat kind of lighting do you prefer? Does so ft lig ht make y ou sleepy? Do you need brig ht lig ht? If it's too bright, you may feel uncom- fortable. If it is too dark, you may feel sleepy . R eme mber that poor lighting can also str ain y our eyes and give you a headac he. 7.H ow does eating affect you? Do you fee l most e nerg ized right after a meal? Or does eat ing t end to make you drowsy? Which foods giv e y ou a lot of energy? Which slow you dow n? 8.C an you put problems or other pressing con- cerns out of your mind to focus on a differe nt task? H ow can y ou minimize distractio ns so y ou can fully focus on your wor k? T hink carefully about each of these questions and be honest with yourself. You may like listening to music, but do you really study better in silence? Do you usually study in your room but are tempted by talking on the phone or using the computer? The more honestly you evaluate your study environment, the more effectively you will use your time, and the less time you will have to spend studying. Write down your answers so you can develop a good study plan. 2 - - ACT STUDY SKILLS AND TE ST-TAKING STRATEGIES Study Groups The majority of your study time should be spent alone in the environment that is best for your study style. However, a good way to get motivated and add some variety to your studying is by forming or join-ing a study group. Studying with a group will not onl y be more fun than studying alone, but if you are stuck on a problem, someone in your group may be able to explain it to you. And do not underestimate the value of helping other people in your group. Explaining a difcult concept to someone else is a great way to reinforce what you know or help you decipher what you do not really understand. There are a few things to consider when you form your study group: Find an appropriate place with few distractions to study. Keep your group small; three or four people is best. Include only other students who are as serious about studying for the ACT as you are. Set an agenda for your meeting, keep it specic, and decide on one concrete goal for your meeting. The Right Tools Help make your study session successful by having the r ight learning tools. As you study for the ACT, have: a good dictionary, such as Merriam-Webster's Col-legiate Dictionary, 11th Edition a calculat or paper or legal pads pencils (and a pencil sharpener) or pens a highlighter, or several, in different colors index or other note cards folders or notebooks a calendar Keep your personal preferences in mind. Perhaps you like to write with a certain kind of pen or on a certain kind of paper. If so, make sure you have that pen or paper with you when you study. It will help you feel more comfortable and relaxed as you work. Learning How You Learn Imagine that you need directions to a restaurant you have never been to before. Which of the following would you do? Look on a map. Ask someone to tell you how to get there. Draw a map or copy someone's written directions. List step-by-step directions. Most people learn in a variety of ways. They learn by seeing, hearing, doing, and organizing infor - mation from the world around them. But most of us te nd to use one of these ways more than the others. That's our dominant (strongest) learning style. How you would handle getting directions, for example, sug - gests which learning style you use most often: Visual. Visual learners learn best by seeing. If you would look at a map for directions, you are prob-ably a visual learner. You understand ideas best whe n they are in pictures or graphs. You may learn better by using different colors as you take notes. Use a highlighter (or several, in different colors) as you read, to mark important ideas. Mapping and diagramming ideas are good learn-ing strategies for visual learners. Auditory. Auditory learners learn best by listen- ing. If you would ask someone to tell you direc-tions, you are probably an auditory learner. You would p robably rather listen to a lecture than read a textbook, and you may learn better by reading aloud. Try recording your notes on a tape player and listening to your tapes. 3 - - ACT STUDY SKILLS AND TE ST-TAKING STRATEGIES Kinesthetic. Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. (Kinesthetic means feeling the movements of the body.) They like to keep their hands and bod-ies moving. If you would draw a map or copy do wn directions, you are probably a kinesthetic learner. You will benet from interacting with the material you are studying. Underline, take notes, and create note cards. Recopying material will help you remember it. Sequential. Sequential learners learn best by put-ting things in order. If you would create a step-by-ste p list of driving directions, you are probably a sequential learner. You may learn better by creat-ing outlines and grouping ideas together into cate gories. Think carefully about how you learn. Which is your dominant learning style? Keep it in mind as you read about Learning Strategies in Part 2 of this chapter. Learning Styles and Finding the Methods Right for You The best way to tackle the preparations involved in studying for the ACT is rst to think about the way you study now. Do you set aside a specic time to do your homework? Is there a place that you always go to study? Do you take on all your subjects at once or start with the easiest? Once you have given some thought to your current study habits, it is time to honestly evaluate how well they work. Creating a Study Plan You will probably spend more time studying for the ACT than you have spent studying for any other test. So even with the best intentions, if you sit down with this book and say, \"I'm going to master the ACT,\" you will most likely get discouraged and give up before you sharpen your number 2 pencil. But if instead you create a study plan by breaking down your tasks into manageable parts and scheduling time to tackle them, you will almost certainly succeed. The rst step you should take is to make a list of ev erything you need to study in order to do well on the ACT. Make this list as detailed as possible. Instead of \"study English\" or \"practice math,\" for example, appropriate tasks should be \"take a practice English test\" or \"go over missed questions on the last math practice test.\" Make your list long. The smaller the tasks, the faster you will cross them off your list. The effort you put forth at the start will more than pay off in the end by eliminating wasted time. What You Know and What You Need to Know In order to make your list, you need to determine what you already know and what you need to learn. To create an effective study plan, you need a good sense of exactly what you need to study. Chances are you already know some of the test material well. Some of it you may need only to review, and some of it you may need to study in detail. Take the ACT practice tests in each chapter of this b ook to nd out how you would do on the exam. How did you score? What do you seem to know well? What do you need to review? What do you need to study in detail? Scheduling Study Time Next, you need to set a time frame. Once you have a go od sense of how much studying is ahead, create a detailed study schedule. Use a calendar to set specic deadlines. If deadlines make you nervous, give your - self plenty of time for each task. Otherwise, you might hav e trouble keeping calm and staying on track. To create a good schedule, break your studying into small tasks that move toward your learning goals. A study plan that says \"Learn everything by May 1\" isn't going to be helpful. However, a study plan that sets dates for learning specic material in March and April will enable you to learn everything by May 1. For example, if you need to focus on building your read-ing comprehension skills, you might create a schedule like the f ollowing: 4 - - ACT STUDY SKILLS AND TE ST-TAKING STRATEGIES Week 1 Review basic reading comprehension strategies. Week 2 Practice nding the main idea. Week 3 Practice vocabulary in context questions. Week 4 Practice specic detail questions. Week 5 Practice infer ence questions. Week 6 Practice nding the r eferences. Week 7 T ake reading practice test. Week 8 Begin r eviewing grammar/usage rules. Week 9 Continue r eviewing grammar/usage rules. Week 10 Start overall r eview. Week 11 Continue overall r eview. Every day Read the editorials in the local newspaper . As you set your deadlines, consider your day-to- day schedule. How much time can you spend on study ing each week? Exactly when can you t in the time to study? Be sure to be realistic about how much time you have and how much you can accomplish. Give yourself the study time you need to succeed. Stick to Your Plan Make sure you have your plan on paper and post your plan whe re you can see it. Do not just keep it in your head! Look at it regularly so you can remember what and when to study. Checking your plan regularly can also help you see how much progress you have made along the way. It is important that you do not give up or get dis couraged if you fall behind. Unexpected events may interrupt your plans. You may have a big test coming up at school or you may come down with the flu. Or it might just take you longer to complete a task than you planned. That's okay. Stick to your schedule as much as possible, but remember that sometimes life gets in the way. So, if you miss one of you r deadlines, do not despair. Instead, just pick up where you left off. Try to squeeze in a little extra time in the next few weeks to catch up. If that does not seem possible, simply adjust your schedule. Change your deadlines so that they are more realistic. Just be sure you still have enough time to nish everything before the exam. You will need to revisit your list often, allotting more time to areas with which you feel less comfort- able and reducing the time needed on areas you have master ed. How Do You Know What You Know? One of the keys to successful studying is knowing what you know and knowing what you don't know. Practice tests are one effective way to measure this. But there are other ways. One of the best ways to measure how well you know so mething is by assessing how well you can explain it to someone else. If you really know the material, you should be able to help someone else understand it. Use your learning style to explain a difcult question to someone in your study group. For example, if you are an auditory learner, talk it out. If you are a visual learner, create diagrams and tables to demonstrate your knowledge. Rewrite your notes or devise your own quizzes with questions and answers like those on the exam. Provide an explanation along with the correct answer. How do you know what you do not kno w? If you feel uncertain or uncomfortable during a practice test or when you try to explain it to someone else, you probably need to study more. Write down all of your questions and uncertainties. If you write down what you do not know, you can focus on searching for answers. When you get the answers, you can write them next to the question and review them periodi-cally. And notice how many questions you answer along the way\u2014you will see yourself making steady progress. 5 - - ACT STUDY SKILLS AND TE ST-TAKING STRATEGIES If you are avoiding certain topics, it is a sign that you don't know those topics well enough for the exam. Make up your mind to tackle these areas at your next study session. Do not procrastinate! Part 2: L earning Strategies How successful you are at studying usually has less to do with how much you know and how much you study than with how you study. That is because some study techniques are more effective than others. You can spend hours and hours doing practice tests, but if you do not carefully review your answers, much of your time will be wasted. You need to learn from your mistakes and study what you do not know. The best method is to use several of the following proven study techniques. You may already be using many of these study skills in your normal schoolwork, but they can help you make the most of your learning style and store information in your long-term memory. Asking Questions Asking questions is a powerful study strategy because it forces you to get actively involved in the material you want to learn. That, in turn, helps you better understand and remember the material. And there is another important benet\u2014the process of asking and answering your own questions helps you become comfortable with the exam format. For example, as you read something, you can ask your self questions like those you would see on the ACT, such as: What is this passage about? What is the main idea? What is the author's purpose and point of view? What is the mood or tone? What is the meaning of this word as it is used in the sentence? Is this sentence a main idea or a detail? Highlighting and Underlining Whenever you read or study, have a pen, pencil, or highlighter in your hand. That way, as you read books, notes, or handouts that belong to you (not the school or library), you can mark the words and ideas that are most important to learn or remember. High-lighting or underlining helps make key ideas stand out. Important information is then easy to nd when you need to take notes or review. The key to effective highlighting or underlining is to be selective. Do not highlight or underline indis- criminately. If you highlight every other sentence, nothing w ill stand out for you on the page. Highlight only the key words and ideas or concepts you do not understand. Taking Notes Taking notes helps you understand, organize, and remember information. The secret to taking useful notes is knowing what you should write down. As with highlighting, the key is to be selective. Take notes about the same things you would underline, espe-cially main ideas, rules, and other items you need to learn. Whenever possible, include examples so that you can see the concept clearly. Making Notes Making notes is often as important as taking notes. Making notes means that you respond to what you study. There are several ways you can respond (talk back) to the text: Write questions. If you see something you don't understand, write a question. What does this mean? Why is this word used this way? Why is this the best title? Then, answer all of your questions. 6 - - ACT STUDY SKILLS AND TE ST-TAKING STRATEGIES Make connections. Any time you make connec- tions between ideas, you improve your chances of re membering that material. For example, if you are trying to learn the denition of the word demographic, you may know that democracy refers to government by the people, while graphic refers to information, written or drawn. From that you can remember that demographic has to do with information about people. Write your reactions. Your reactions work much like connections, and they can help you remem-ber information. Outlining and Mapping Information Outlines are great tools, especially for sequential learners. They help you focus on what is most impor - tant by making it easier to review key ideas and see re lationships among those ideas. With an outline, you can see how supporting information is related to main ideas. The basic outline structure is this: I. Topic 1. Main idea a. Major supporting idea i. Minor supporting idea Mapping information is similar to making an outline. The difference is that maps are less struc- tured. You do not have to organize ideas from top to bo ttom. Instead, with a map, the ideas can go all over the page. The key is that you still show how the ideas are related. Making Flash Cards Flash cards are a simple but effective study tool. First, buy or cut out small pieces of paper (3 \u00d7 5 index cards work well). On one side, put a question or word you need to learn. On the back, put the answer. You can use different colors and pictures, especially if you are a visual learner. Memorizing versus Remembering It is true that repetition is the key to mastery. Try repeating a new phone number over and over, for example. Eventually you will remember it. But it may stay only in your short-term memory. In a few days (or maybe even a few hours), you are likely to forget the number. You need to use it to really learn it and store the information in your long-term memory. Although there are some tricks you can use to help remember things in the short term, your best bet is to use what you are learning as much and as soon as possible. This is especially important when you are studying for the ACT, because much of the test focuses on your reasoning skills and not simple memoriza-tion. This means you really have to understand the mate rial, because you will not be given the opportu- nity simply to recall information. This does not mean that y ou do not need to know basic information in all of the areas covered. If, for example, you do not know common punctuation rules, you will get answers wrong on the ACT English Test. If you nd (through the ACT or practice questions) that you do not remember certain grammar rules or math concepts, you will need to study them. Here are some general strategies to help you re member information as you prepare for the ACT: Learn information in small chunks. Our brains process small chunks of information better than large ones. If you have a list of 20 grammar rules, break that list into four lists of ve rules each. Spread out your memory work. Do not try to remember too much at one time. For example, if you break up those 20 rules into four lists, do not try to do all four lists, one after another. Instead, try studying one list each day in several short, spaced-out sessions. For example, spend 20 min-utes in the morning getting familiar with the new rules. Review the rules again for 15 minutes at lunchtime. Take another 15 minutes while you are on the bus going home. Add another ten-minute review before bed. This kind of 7 SLEEP ON I T A rested and relaxed brain learns information best. Whenever possible, study right before you go to sleep or rst thing after you awaken. Try not to do anything else in between. If you study for an hour and then watch TV for an hour before bed, you will not remember as much as if you studied for an hour and then went right to bed. Right before and after sleep, you are usually in your most relaxed state\u2014and that makes it easier for you to learn. distributed practice is very effective. It is also a sneaky way to add more study time to your schedule. And it provides lots of repetition with- out tiring your brain. Access Your Teachers Talk to your current and past teachers to nd out how they can help. They can probably point out the areas they think you need to review and they may offer extra help on subjects that are giving you trouble. Make connections. You learn best when you make connections to things you already know. Use visual aids, especially if you are a visual Go thr ough Old T ests and T exts learner. Help yourself see in your mind what you Some of the material on the ACT will be from sub- jects you are not currently taking. Go through your old exams (talk to your former teachers if you do not have them), and use your old textbooks to refresh your memory. need to learn. Use your voice, especially if you are an auditory learner. Say aloud what you need to learn; you can even sing it if you like, especially if you can make a rhyme. Any time you are learning gram- mar and st ructure, say a sample sentence aloud sev eral times. Try different variations, too. Part 3: T est-T aking Strategies ACT-Specific Strategies Knowing the material on which you will be tested improves your chances of succeeding. But it does not guarantee that you will do your best on the exam. The ACT does not test just your knowledge of Eng- lish, math, science, and writing. Like all standardized tests, it also measures your test-taking skills. In this section, you will learn strategies for taking standard- ized tests like the ACT. The amount of material covered in the ACT may seem overwhelming at rst. But keep in mind that there should be little new information for you to learn. The most important thing to do is identify your areas of weakness. Once you do that, you will realize that the few grammar rules and math problems you need to learn are entirely manageable. Learn from Your Mistakes Learn about the Test Spend time reviewing your practice questions to determine exactly why you got an answer wrong. Did you misread the question? Are you unfamiliar with comma usage? Only when you pinpoint exactly why you answered something incorrectly can you learn to get it right. One sure way to increase your chances of success is to nd out as much as you can about the exam. If you do not know what to expect on the test, you will not know how to study. It is likely that you will be extra anxious about the exam, too. The more you know about the test, the better you can prepare\u2014and the more relaxed you will be when the test comes. 8 - - ACT STUDY SKILLS AND TE ST-TAKING STRATEGIES options: a. b. c. d. e. You already know what kind of test the ACT is. You know that there are ve separate tests that make up the whole ACT: English, math, reading, science, and the optional writing test. You know that the test questions for the rst four tests are all multiple-choice. You know how much time you have to complete each test. But until you look at actual sample questions, you still do not really know what to expect. For example, in the reading test, what kind of passages will you be presented with? What kind of questions will you be asked about those passages? Getting sample tests and working with skill bui lders like this book can help you in many ways. You will get used to the kind of questions asked and the level of difculty of those questions. You will also become familiar with the format and comfortable with the length of the exam. When you take your practice tests, try to re-create the ac tual testing conditions as closely as possible. Sit in a chair at a desk or table somewhere free from dis-tractions. Time the test and use only the amount of time y ou would have on the real test. After you score your test, review your answers carefully. Ask yourself why you got the questions wrong that you did and add those concepts to your study schedule. Timing The more practice tests you take, the more comfort-able you will feel regarding how long you have to answ er each question. Y ou should be able to spend less time answering the easier questions, and then come back to the harder ones with the time remaining. The following list gives you a basic idea of how long y ou have for each question (remember that some questions will be easier than others and will, therefore, require less time): English: 30 seconds Math: 1 minute Reading: 30 seconds (with about 5 minutes to read each passage) Science: 30 seconds Multiple-Choice Test Strategies Multiple-choice is the most popular question format for standardized tests like the ACT. Understandably so: multiple-choice questions are easy and fast to grade. They are also popular because they are gener - ally considered obj ective. They are questions based solely on information and do not allow the test taker to express opinions. Multiple-choice questions have two parts: 1. Stem: the question 2. Options: the answer choices The incorrect answers are called distracters. stem: If a = 10, then which of the following rep- rese nts 803? 8a + 3 80a + 3 8a2+ 3 8a3+ 3 8a4+ 3 In t his question, the correct answer is b. Th e other options are all distracters. Here are six strate- gies to help you answer multiple-choice questions corr ectly: 1. Circle or underline key words in the stem. These ar e the words that help you search for the cor rect answer. For example, in the stem: The modern bicycle has all of the following safety features EXCEPT the ke y words are modern, safety features, and except . You need to look in the passage for the safety features of modern bicycles. And you need to select the answer choice that is not specically mentioned in the passage. 2. Immediately cross out all answers you know are incorrect. This will help you nd the correct 9 - - ACT STUDY SKILLS AND TE ST-TAKING STRATEGIES answer. It is an especially important step if you have to guess the answer. 3. Beware of distracter techniques. Test develop-ers will often put in look-alike options, easily confuse d options, and silly options. 4. Read stems carefully: Be sure you understand exac tly what is being asked. Watch for tricky wording such as \"All of the following are true EXCEPT.\" You will nd distracters that seem accurate and may sound right but do not apply to that stem. For example, if you don't notice the except on the bicycle question stem, you might choose a distracter that is a safety feature of the modern bicycle. The answer would seem accurate but would be wrong because you did not read the question carefully. 5. Beware of absolutes. Read carefully any stem that includ es words like always , never, none, or all. An answer may sound perfectly correct and the general principle may be correct. However, it may not be true in all circumstances. 6. Work easiest questions rst. Although the q uestions on the ACT are not in order of difculty, you should still quickly read through a question, and if it seems too hard, circle it and come back to it later. Remember that easy questions are worth the same as hard questions. Almost There: Strategies for the Final Days before the Exam Your months of preparation will soon pay off. You have worked hard, and the test is just a week or two away. Here are some tips for making sure things go smoothly in the home stretch. The Week before the Test: Be sure you know exactly where you are taking the test. Get detailed directions. Take a practice drive or mass transit trip so you know exactly how long it will take to get there. Review everything you have learned. Get quality sleep each night. Practice visualization\u2014see yourself performing well on the ACT. The Day before the Test: Get light exercise. Do not work out too hard. You do not want to be sore or physically exhausted the day of the exam. Get everything you will need ready: pencils/pens, a calculator, admission materials/documentation, and water or any mints or snacks you would like to have along. Make a list of everything you need to bring so you don't forget anything in the morning. Get to bed early. Make sure you set your alarm. Ask a family mem-ber to make sure you are up on time. The Day of the Test: Get up early. Eat a light, healthy breakfast, such as yogurt and granola or a low-fat, low-sugar cereal and fruit. Dress comfortably. Wear layers so that you can take off a sweatshirt or sweater if you are too warm in the test room. Do not drastically alter your diet. For example, if you drink coffee every morning, do not skip it\u2014 you could get a headache. However, do not drink a second cup or super-sized portion. Too much caffeine can make you jittery during the exam, and you may crash when the caffeine wears off. At the Test Site: Chat with others, but not about the test. That might only make you more nervous. Think positively. Remember, you are prepared. Avoid squeezing in a last-minute review. Instead, visualize your success and plan your reward for after the test is over. After the Test: Celebrate! 10 - - ACT STUDY SKILLS AND TE ST-TAKING STRATEGIES WHAT TO BRING TO THE TEST picture ID admission slip calculator watch three number 2 pencils with erasers sweatshirt or sweater water nutritious snack Handling and Preventing Test Stress Handling Test Stress Test anxiety is like the common cold. Most people suff er from it periodically. It won't kill you, but it can make your life miserable for several days. Like a cold, test anxiety can be mild or severe. Yo u may just feel an underlying nervousness about the upcoming exam. Or you may be nearly paralyzed with worry, especially if there is a lot riding on the exam. Whatever the case, if you have test anxiety, you need to cope with it. Fortunately, many strategies help prevent and treat test anxiety. Prevention The best cure for test anxiety is to pr event it from happening in the rst place. Test anxiety is often caused by a lack of preparation. If you learn all you can about the test and create and follow a study plan, you should be in good shape when it comes to exam time. Here are some other, more general strategies: Establish and stick to a routine. Routines help us feel more comfortable and in control. Whenever possible, study at the same time and in the same place. Make your test preparation a habit that is hard to break. Studying for the ACT will become easier as it becomes routine. You will be more likely to avoid distractions, and others will know not to disturb you during your ACT study time. Keep your general stress level low. If there are a lot of other stresses in your life, chances are a big test will make those other stresses seem more difcult to manage. Remember to keep things in perspective. If something is beyond your control, don't waste your energy worrying about it. Instead, think of how you can handle what is in your control. Stay condent. Remind yourself that you are smart and capable. You can take this test\u2014and you can do well on it. Stay healthy. When your body is run down or ill, your brainpower will suffer, too. You are much more likely to be overtaken by worries. Take care of yourself throughout the test-preparation process. (See more information at the end of this chapter.) Treatment If it is too late to prevent test anxiety, don't panic. You can st ill treat it effectively. Here are some strategies to help reduce test stress: Face your fears. Admit that you are worried about the test, and examine the reasons. Your fears won't change the fact that you have to take the test, but they can paralyze you and keep you from studying and doing well on the exam. Acknowledge your fears, put them in perspective, and refuse to let your fears hurt you. One helpful strategy is to write down your fear s. When you put your worries on paper, they seem more manageable than when they are bouncing around in your brain and keeping you awake at night. Once you write down your fears, you can then brainstorm solutions. For example, imagine you are worried about not being able to nd enough time to get your work done and nish studying. Once you put this fear down on paper, you can begin to determine how to squeeze in the hours you need to get everything done, and you will feel more in control. 11 - - ACT STUDY SKILLS AND TE ST-TAKING STRATEGIES Keep things in perspective. Yes, the ACT is a big deal; it is an important test. But even if you do poorly on the test, is it the end of the world? Will your family stop loving you? Will you be less of a person? Of course not. And if you really blow it, remember that you can take the test again. Per - spective is important to performance. Of course you should b e serious about succeeding. But don't lose sight of other important aspects of your life. Be sufciently prepared. Anxiety often comes from feeling insecure in a new situation. But if you prepare well, using this and other books, the ACT will not be new to you. And if you follow your study plan, you will know how to answer the questions. If you have fallen behind, remember that it is not too late to catch up. Stop making excuses. Excuses may give you some comfort in the short term, but they do not take away test anxiety\u2014and they will not help you do well on the exam. In fact, excuses often make things worse by making you feel guilty and pow-erless. Do not let yourself feel like a victim. You may ha ve a lot of things happening in your life and many things may interfere with your studies, but you have the power to choose how you deal with your circumstances. Imagine yourself succeeding. Highly successful people will often tell you that one of their secrets is visualization. In their mind's eye, they see themselves succeeding. They imagine the situa-tions they will face, and then imagine themselves handling those sit uations beautifully. Visualization is a powerful tool. It is a way of te lling yourself that you believe you can do it. The power of this kind of belief is amazing. If you believe you can accomplish something, you are far more likely to accomplish it. Likewise, if you believe you can't do something, you are far more likely to fail. Positive visualization will make it easier for you to study and manage your entire test-preparation process. Anyone can use the power of visualization. Pict ure yourself sitting calmly through the exam, answering one question after another correctly. See yourself getting excellent test results in the mail. Imagine yourself telling family and friends how well you did on the exam. Picture yourself receiving the college acceptance letter you desire. Stick to your study plan. Test anxiety can para-lyze you if you let it. And before you know it, you hav e missed several deadlines on your study plan. Guess what? That only makes your test anxiety worse. As soon as you feel your stomach start to flutter with test anxiety, return to your study plan. Make an extra effort to stick to your schedule. A Healthy Mind and a Healthy Body It is difcult to do your best on a test when you are not feeling well. Your mind and body need to be in good shape for the test. If you let your body get run-down, you may become ill. That, in turn, sets you bac k on your study schedule. And that may lead to test anxiety, which can make you feel run-down again. You need to avoid this downward spiral. If you do feel run-down, take a day or two to rest and feel better. Maybe you will be two days behind your study schedule, but when you continue, your studying will be more effective. As long as it is not a constant prob-lem for you and as long as you are not using illness to av oid studying, you will do yourself a favor by resting. Take good care of yourself throughout the entire test-p reparation process and especially in the week before the exam. Here are some specic suggestions for staying healthy: Get enough rest. Some of us need eight or more hours of sleep each night. Others are happy with just six. You know what your body needs for you to feel clear-headed and energized. Make sleep a priority, so that you are able to concentrate the day of the exam. If you have trouble sleeping, try one of the following strategies: 12 - - ACT STUDY SKILLS AND TE ST-TAKING STRATEGIES Get exercise during the day. A tired body will demand more sleep. Get up and study. If you study in the night when you can't sleep, you can cut out study time from the next day so you can take a nap or get to bed earlier. (Of course, sometimes study-ing will help you fall asleep in the rst place.) Relax with a hot bath, a good book, or sleep-inducing foods. A glass of warm milk, for example, may help you fall back asleep. Do some gentle stretching or seated forward bends. Try to touch your toes with your legs outstretched. This is a relaxing posture. Or practice a few relaxation poses from yoga: child's pose or cat stretch (see a website like www.yoga.com for details). Spend a few minutes doing deep breathing. Fill your lungs slowly and completely. Hold for a few seconds and then release slowly and com-pletely. You can practice deep breathing any-time you need to relax or regain focus. Write down your worries. Again, putting your fears on paper can help make them more manageable. Eat well. Keeping a healthy diet is often as hard as getting enough rest when you are busy preparing for a test. But how you eat can have a tremendous impact on how you study and how you perform on the e xam. You may think you are saving time by eating fast food. But in reality, you are depriv-ing your body of the nutrition it needs to per - form at its best. You may think that a couple of extr a cups of coffee a day are a good thing because you can stay up later and study. But in reality, you are tricking your brain into thinking that it's awake and you are making yourself more dependent on caffeine. Foods to avoid\u2014especially at test time\u2014 includ e high-sugar, high-calorie, low-nutrition foods, such as doughnuts, chips, and cookies. Instead, nd healthy substitutes.

Passage I\u2014Sigmund Freud The father and originator of 1 psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), is largely respon- sible for the way we understand ourselves, as cr eatures, with2 conflicting \"selves\" and desires. Freud posited3 the notion that the mind is teeming with \"psychic energy\" and that our personality is shaped largely by the interactions of the levels of the mind. Among Freud's most important contributions to modern psychology and the contemporary understanding of the self is his theory of the unconscious. (1) According to Freud, the mind is much lik e an iceberg. (2) Most of our minds4 activi- ties, then, occur beneath the surface, in the unc onscious and beyond our knowing. (3) The conscious is the part of the mind of w hich we are aware; it is the tip of the iceberg that is visible above the water. (4) The uncon-scious, on the other hand, 5 is all that is below the surface\u2014the thoughts, feelings, and desires that we are not aware of but that nonetheless aff ect our behavior. Freud believed that the unconscious is deterministic. That is, our behaviors are caused (determined) by thoughts and impulses deep in our unconscious\u2014of which thoughts and impulses we are not aware.6 This is related to the phenomenon called \"Freudian slip.\"7 Unless we psychoanalyze ourselves, we may never be aware of the hidden reasons for our actions. This suggests that the notion of free will might have been 8 an illusion and that our choices are governed by hidden mental processes which we have no control over.9 Repression is the act of pushing our con- flicts to the unconscious. So that10 we are no longer aware of them. It is our chief de fense mechanism (a way to avoid conflict between our true desires and our senses of right and wrong 11). Freud believed that too much repres- sion can lead to neurosis, a mental disorder resulting in depression or abnormal behavior, sometimes with physical symptoms but with no evidence of disease. 1. a.

At rst, I thought yoga was just another tness fad, like step aerobics classes or Tae Bo. But after my rst class, I understood why yoga has lasted for thousands of years and why so many people are completely into 16 this practice. Yoga is different from other tness activi- ties because it is not only physical. In the cor - rect form,17 yoga is a practice of unication: an emotional, spiritual, and physical exercise. Although it may seem easy to those who18 have never practiced, yoga poses require great concentration, and they are 19 surprisingly affec- tive20 in stretching and strengthening muscles. A simple sitting pose such as staff pose, for example, requires you to tighten and lengthen stomach, back, and arm muscles as you stretch you're 21 legs out in front of you and place your hands by your side. More difcult poses, such as brave warrior, require you to balance on one leg and hold a pose that strengthens leg, back, and stomach muscles, which is good for you. 22 While yoga tones and strengthens the body, it also tones and strengthens the mind. Many poses can be only held 23 if you are com- pletely focused on the task, and full benet of the poses comes only through proper breathing. Concentrated deep breathing during yoga helps you extend more fully into the poses, thereby gaining greater benet from the stretch. And the st eady24 circulation of breath through your body both calms and energizes. I am still relatively new to yoga. I have o nly been practicing for one year. I am addicted to yoga25 unlike any other physical activity because it is also a spiritual practice. Through yoga, I am able to release tensions that lodge in various parts of my body: the tight shoulders, the cramped legs, the belly that is in knots. 26 The physical release is also a spiritual release: I feel calm after doing yoga, reconnected to my b ody, reconnected to myself, more27 at peace with the world. After a series of asanas (poses), I feel the universal life force within. 16. f. NO CHANGE g. hooked on h. devoted to j. pra ctitioners of 17. a. NO CHANGE b. Do ne correctly, c. To do it correctly, d. Omit the underlined portion. 18. f. NO CHANGE g. that h. whom j. which 19. a. NO CHANGE b. concentration, and is c. concentration, and are d. concentration and is 20. f. NO CHANGE g. affected h. effected j. effective 21. a. NO CHANGE b. one's c. your d. these 22. f. NO CHANGE g. which benets you. h. which is good for your health. j. Omit the underlined portion, and change the c omma to a period. 23 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 23. a. NO CHANGE b. are only holding c. can only be holden d. can be held only 24. f. NO CHANGE g. stretch, the steady h. stretch. The steady j. stretch, also the steady 25. To improve the sentence structure here by c ombining sentences, which of the following choices is the most effective option? a. I am still relatively new to yoga. Practicing o nly for one year, I am addicted to yoga . . . b. Still relatively new to yoga, I have been p racticing for only one year. But I am addicted to yoga . . . c. I am still relatively new to yoga\u2014I have been p racticing for only one year\u2014but I am addicted to yoga . . . d. Although I am relatively new to yoga, I have b een practicing for only one year. Still, I am addicted to yoga . . . 26. f. NO CHANGE g. knotted belly. h. knots within the belly. j. aching within the stomach area. 27. a. NO CHANGE b. to myself more, c. to myself more, and d. to myself, and more 28. To add some gurative language to the essay, w hich of the following images would be most effective and appropriate? f. I feel like a million bucks after doing yoga. g. Yoga is like a warm blanket. h. Yoga is like a drug. j. Yoga is a peaceful journey. 29. If the writer were to combine two paragraphs, w hich two paragraphs would it be most logical to connect? a. paragraphs 1 and 2 b. paragraphs 2 and 3 c. paragraphs 3 and 4 d. paragraphs 4 and 5 30. The writer would like readers to do some basic y oga poses after reading this essay. To achieve this goal, the writer should f. list the best yoga videos so readers can pur chase them. g. compare and contrast yoga to another t ness activity, such as aerobics. h. tell readers how to get into those basic p ositions. j. describe the benets of deep-breathing e xercises. Passage III\u2014The Cold War (1) The Cold War was one of the most interest-ing and troubling times in American history. (2) Several dramatically important historical e vents31 led to the Cold War. (3) First, in 1939, Albert Einstein wrote a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. (4) In that letter, Einstein tells 32 Roosevelt that it was possible to create an atomic weapon, and he asked Roosevelt to fund research and experiment 33 in atomic weapons. (5) Roosevelt agreed, and the government created the Manhattan Project, a massive effort to develop nuclear weapons. (6) This was the rst important step toward the 24 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 Cold War. (7) Next came the date that will live in history: August 6, 1945. (8) The United States dropped an atomic bomb on a civilian, not military, target, Hiroshima, Japan. 34 (9) An estimate of 35 150,000 civilians were killed in the attack. (10) President Harry Truman and others claimed at the time that dropping the bomb was necessary to force Japan to surrender to 36 end World War II. (11) Others argue that we used the bomb largely to show the Soviet Union that we were a superior world power. (12) Although the United States and the USSR w ere ofcially allies, tension37 between the two countries were already high. (13) A deep ideo-logical battle between the two countries\u2014one c ommunist, the other capitalist\u2014was already in pla ce; and38 each country was determined to outdo the other. (14) Two years later, in 1947, President Truman established the Truman Doctrine. (15) This important document renamed 39 American foreign policy. (16) It created a \"policy of containment,\" which framed our foreign policy as a battle between \"good\" and \"evil.\" (17) This dramatically increased the growing animosity between the tw o opposing sides.40 (18) These tensions did not lead to an actual war between the world powers, which might have had disastrous results. (19) Instead, they were the cause of years of political, economic, and diplomatic 41 conflict: the Cold War. 31. a.

The writer is considering changing the title of this essa y. The best title would be a. A History of the Cold War. b. Events of the Cold War. c. The Road to the Cold War. d. A Dark Time in American History: T he Cold War. Passage IV\u2014 The Industrial Revolution (1) In the rst century of the Industrial Revolu- tion, the country undergoing the most dra-matic change was England. (2) After 1850, the I ndustrial Revolution spread rapidly46 through- out Europe. (3) While the pace of change dur - ing the Industrial Revolution was indeed very r apid, the Industrial Revolution itself stretched over a rather long period of time\u2014from the midd le of the eighteenth century in the 1700s47 through World War I (1914). The Industrial Revolution was essentially a r apid change in the method of production of mat erial goods.49 Products once made by hand were now able to be produced by machine or by chemical processes. The Industrial Revolution transformed Western society, creating an inter - national capitalist economy, urbanization, labor r eforms, a system to educate the public,50 and labor specialization. Several key discoveries and inventions e nabled the Industrial Revolution to take place, inc luded51 machines and tools like the cotton gin, the radio, the circular saw, the cylindrical press, and steam engine.52 Cement, dynamite, and aluminum were invented, as were the bleaching and paper-making processes. At the same t ime,53 there was a tremendous growth in population and urbanization. In fact, the popu- lation growth in England was so dramatic that the countries 54 population doubled between 1750-1820.55 This meant a great demand for 26 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 food, clothing, and shelter, demands that b ecame the driving force behind56 the Indus- trial Revolution. Mass production of goods was largely made possible due to57 the steam engine. The steam engine enabled factories to move from the countryside (where there were bodies of water, their source of power) into cities and towns, which were becoming increasingly crowded. 46. f.

Passage V\u2014Science Fiction One of the most famous novels of all time, M ary Shelley's Frankenstein, marked61 not only the high point of a young woman's literary career. But62 also the beginning of a brand-new genre of literature being science ction.63 In her remarkable tale, Shelley explores what might happen if a scientic possibility\u2014the ability to restore life to the dead\u2014were to become a real- ity. Science ction explores how what might be 64would affect our world if it really was. What Shelley began, H.G. Wells perfected in d ozens of science ction works including his most famous w orks:65 The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds. While Shelley's Franken-stein created a living creature from the body par ts of the dead, Wells's characters traveled through time; created half-animal, half-human creatures; made themselves invisible; and having been attacked by Martians. 66 In all of his novels, Wells; like Shelley,67 used scientic possibilities to analyze and often criticize his own society. The War of the Worlds, for exam- ple, is a thinly disguised attack on the British c olonialism of his time. Science ction flourished in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s with pulp maga- zines that for the masses churned out science ction stories.68 Meanwhile, in Europe, science ction writers were using science ction to help bring about political change. Y evgeny Zamyatin's classic novel We , for example, is against69 the Soviet Union's communist agenda. 28 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 Today, science ction writers around the world continue to explore possibilities\u2014 possibilities that are fast becoming realities. Much of what science ction writers only dreamed of a century ago, such as cloning and space travel, have70 already come to pass. What lies71 ahead? How will we handle these and other upcoming advances? Let us hope that science ction writers are wrong, for all too often, characters in science ction stories, like they're 72 forefather Victor Frankenstein, are unable to handle73 the responsibility of having so much power over nature. 61. a.

The writer wishes to add a brief summary of the plot o f Frankenstein. The most logical place for this addition would be a. to add it to the end of paragraph 1. b. to create a new paragraph between par agraphs 1 and 2. c. to add it after the third sentence in par agraph 1. d. to create a new paragraph between par agraphs 2 and 3.

Read each passage carefully and then select the best possible answer for each question. Passage I\u2014Prose Fiction This passage is taken from Babbitt, by Sinclair Lewis, 1922. 1 T here was nothing of the giant in the aspect of 2 the man who was beginning to awaken on the 3 sleeping-porch of a Dutch Colonial house in 4 that residential district of Zenith known as Flo - 5 r al Heights. 6 His name was George F. Babbitt. He was 7 forty-six years old now, in April, 1920, and he 8 made nothing in particular, neither butter nor 9 shoes nor poetry, but he was nimble in the call - ing of selling houses for more than people could 11 afford to pay. 12 His large head was pink, his brown hair 13 thin and dry. His face was babyish in slumber, 14 despite his wrinkles and the red spectacle-dents 15 on the slopes of his nose. He was not fat but he 16 was exceedingly well fed; his cheeks were pads, 17 and the unroughened hand which lay helpless 18 upon the khaki-colored blanket was slightly 19 puffy. He seemed prosperous, extremely mar - ried and unromantic; and altogether unroman- 21 tic appeared this sleeping-porch, which looked 22 on one sizable elm, two respectable grass-plots, 23 a cement driveway, and a corrugated iron 24 garage. Yet Babbitt was again dreaming of the 25 fairy child, a dream more romantic than scarlet 26 pagodas by a silver sea. 27 For years the fairy child had come to him. 28 Where others saw but Georgie Babbitt, she dis - 29 cerned gallant youth. She waited for him, in the darkness beyond mysterious groves. When at 31 last he could slip away from the crowded house 32 he darted to her. His wife, his clamoring 33 friends, sought to follow, but he escaped, the 34 girl fleet beside him, and they crouched 35 together on a shadowy hillside. She was so slim, 36 so white, so eager! She cried that he was gay and 37 valiant, that she would wait for him, that they 38 would sail\u2014 39 Rumble and bang of the milk-truck. Babbitt moaned; turned over; struggled 41 back toward his dream. He could see only her 42 face now, beyond misty waters. The furnace- 43 man slammed the basement door. A dog barked 44 in the next yard. As Babbitt sank blissfully into 45 a dim warm tide, the paper-carrier went by 46 whistling, and the rolled-up Advocate thumped 47 the front door. Babbitt roused, his stomach 48 constricted with alarm. As he relaxed, he was 49 pierced by the familiar and irritating rattle of someone cranking a Ford: snapah-ah, 40 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 51 snap-ah-ah, snap-ah-ah. Himself a pious 52 motorist, Babbitt cranked with the unseen 53 driver, with him waited through taut hours for 54 the roar of the starting engine, with him ago- 55 nized as the roar ceased and again began the 56 infernal patient snap-ah-ah\u2014a round, flat 57 sound, a shivering cold-morning sound, a 58 sound infuriating and inescapable. Not till the 59 rising voice of the motor told him that the Ford 60 was moving was he released from the panting 61 tension. He glanced once at his favorite tree, 62 elm twigs against the gold patina of sky, and 63 fumbled for sleep as for a drug. He who had 64 been a boy very credulous of life was no longer 65 greatly interested in the possible and improba- 66 ble adventures of each new day. 67 He escaped from reality till the alarm- 68 clock rang, at seven-twenty. 69 It was the best of nationally advertised 70 and quantitatively produced alarm-clocks, with 71 all modern attachments, including cathedral 72 chime, intermittent alarm, and a phosphores- 73 cent dial. Babbitt was proud of being awakened 74 by such a rich device. Socially it was almost as 75 creditable as buying expensive cord tires. 76 He sulkily admitted now that there was no 77 more escape, but he lay and detested the grind 78 of the real-estate business, and disliked his fam- 79 ily, and disliked himself for disliking them. The 80 evening before, he had played poker at Vergil 81 Gunch's till midnight, and after such holidays 82 he was irritable before breakfast. It may have 83 been the tremendous home-brewed beer of the 84 Prohibition era and the cigars to which that 85 beer enticed him; it may have been resentment 86 of return from this ne, bold man-world to a 87 restricted region of wives and stenographers, 88 and of suggestions not to smoke so much. 89 From the bedroom beside the sleeping- 90 porch, his wife's detestably cheerful \"Time to 91 get up, Georgie boy,\" and the itchy sound, the 92 brisk and scratchy sound, of combing hairs out 93 of a stiff brush. 94 He grunted; he dragged his thick legs, in 95 faded baby-blue pajamas, from under the khaki 96 blanket; he sat on the edge of the cot, running 97 his ngers through his wild hair, while his 98 plump feet mechanically felt for his slippers. He 99 looked regretfully at the blanket\u2014forever a 100 s uggestion to him of freedom and heroism. He 101 had bought it for a camping trip which had 102 never come off. It symbolized gorgeous loang, 103 gorgeous cursing, virile flannel shirts. 1. What physical attributes of George Babbitt can b e inferred from the passage? a. He is overweight. b. He is skinny. c. He is of average build. d. He is very tall. 2. According to the passage, George Babbitt is f. a p oet. g. a shoemaker. h. a real estate broker. j. unemployed. 3.

The young girl in Babbitt's dream best symbol-izes what desire? a. to return to sleep b. to be young and free from his workaday w orld c. the love he once had for his wife d. his desire to move out of the suburbs 10. The sentence He who had been a boy very credu-lous of life was no longer greatly interested in the p ossible and improbable adventures of each new day (lines 63-66) most closely means that f. as a child, Babbitt was optimistic about life, b ut he now believes it will always be the same. g.

Passage II\u2014Humanities This passage is excerpted from \"Leonardo da Vinci\" from Knights of Art: Stories of the Italian Painters, by Amy Steedman, 1907. 1 On the sunny slopes of Monte Albano, between 2 Florence and Pisa, the little town of Vinci lay 3 high among the rocks that crowned the steep 4 hillside. Here in the year 1452 Leonardo, son of 5 Ser Piero da Vinci, was born. It was in the age 6 when people told fortunes by the stars, and 7 when a baby was born they would eagerly look 8 up and decide whether it was a lucky or 9 unlucky star which shone upon the child. 10 Surely if it had been possible in this way to tell 11 what fortune awaited the little Leonardo, a 12 strange new star must have shone that night, 13 brighter than the others and unlike the rest in 14 the dazzling light of its strength and beauty. 15 Leonardo was always a strange child. Even 16 his beauty was not like that of other children. 17 He had the most wonderful waving hair, falling 18 in regular ripples, like the waters of a fountain, 19 the color of bright gold, and soft as spun silk. 20 His eyes were blue and clear, with a mysterious 21 light in them, not the warm light of a sunny 22 sky, but rather the blue that glints in the 42 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 23 iceberg. They were merry eyes too, when he 24 laughed, but underneath was always that 25 strange cold look. There was a charm about his 26 smile which no one could resist, and he was a 27 favorite with all. Yet people shook their heads 28 sometimes as they looked at him, and they 29 talked in whispers of the old witch who had 30 lent her goat to nourish the little Leonardo 31 when he was a baby. The woman was a dealer in 32 black magic, and who knew but that the child 33 might be a changeling? 34 It was the old grandmother, Mona Lena, 35 who brought Leonardo up and spoilt him not a 36 little. His father, Ser Piero, was a lawyer, and 37 spent most of his time in Florence, but when he 38 returned to the old castle of Vinci, he began to 39 give Leonardo lessons and tried to nd out 40 what the boy was t for. But Leonardo hated 41 those lessons and would not learn, so when he 42 was seven years old he was sent to school. 43 This did not answer any better. The rough 44 play of the boys was not to his liking. When he 45 saw them drag the wings off butterflies, or tor - 46 ture any animal that fell into their hands, his 47 face grew white with pain, and he would take 48 no share in their games. The Latin grammar, 49 too, was a terrible task, while the many things 50 he longed to know no one taught him. 51 So it happened that many a time, instead 52 of going to school, he would slip away and 53 escape up into the hills, as happy as a little wild 54 goat. Here was all the sweet fresh air of heaven, 55 instead of the stuffy schoolroom. Here were no 56 cruel, clumsy boys, but all the wild creatures 57 that he loved. Here he could learn the real 58 things his heart was hungry to know, not 59 merely words which meant nothing and led to 60 nowhere. 61 For hours he would lie perfectly still with 62 his heels in the air and his chin resting in his 63 hands, as he watched a spider weaving its web, 64 breathless with interest to see how the delicate 65 thr eads were turned in and out. The gaily 66 painted butterflies, the fat buzzing bees, the lit- 67 tle shar p-tongued green lizards, he loved to 68 watch them all, but above everything he loved 69 the birds. Oh, if only he too had wings to dart 70 like the swallows, and swoop and sail and dart 71 again! What was the secret power in their 72 wings? Surely by watching he might learn it. 73 Sometimes it seemed as if his heart would burst 74 with the longing to learn that secret. It was 75 always the hidden reason of things that he 76 desired to know. Much as he loved the flowers 77 he must pull their petals off, one by one, to see 78 how each was joined, to wonder at the dusty 79 pollen, and touch the honey-covered stamens. 80 Then when the sun began to sink he would 81 turn sadly homewards, very hungry, with torn 82 clothes and tired feet, but with a store of sun- 83 shine in his hear t. 84 His grandmother shook her head when 85 Leonardo appeared after one of his days of 86 wandering. 87 \"I know thou shouldst be whipped for 88 playing truant,\" she said; \"and I should also 89 punish thee for tearing thy clothes.\" 90 \"Ah! But thou wilt not whip me,\" 91 answered Leonardo, smiling at her with his 92 curious quiet smile, for he had full condence 93 in her love. 94 \"Well, I love to see thee happy, and I will 95 not punish thee this time,\" said his grand- 96 mothe r; \"but if these tales reach thy father's ears, 97 he will not be so tender as I am towards thee.\" 98 And, sure enough, the very next time that 99 a complaint was made from the school, his 100 father happened to be at home, and then the 101 storm burst. 102 \"Next time I will flog thee,\" said Ser Piero 103 sternly, with rising anger at the careless air of 104 the boy. \"Meanwhile we will see what a little 105 imprisonment will do towards making thee a 106 better child.\" 43 - - IIIACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 107 Then he took the boy by the shoulders 108 and led him to a little dark cupboard under 109 the stairs, and there shut him up for three 110 whole days. 111 There was no kicking or beating at the 112 locked door. Leonardo sat quietly there in the 113 dark, thinking his own thoughts, and wonder - 114 ing why there seemed so little justice in the 115 world. But soon even that wonder passed away, 116 and as usual when he was alone he began to 117 dream dreams of the time when he should have 118 learned the swallows' secrets and should have 119 wings like theirs. 120 But if there were complaints about Leon-121 ardo's dislike of the boys and the Latin gram-122 mar, there would be none about the lessons he 123 chose to learn. Indeed, some of the masters 124 began to dread the boy's eager questions, which 125 were sometimes more than they could answer. 126 Scarcely had he begun the study of arithmetic 127 than he made such rapid progress, and wanted 128 to puzzle out so many problems, that the mas-129 ters were amazed. His mind seemed always 130 eagerly asking for more light, and was never 131 satised. 11. It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that L eonardo's grandmother did not punish him because she a. knew his father would punish him. b. believed it would not do any good. c. was afraid of Leonardo's magic powers. d. enjoyed seeing him happy. 12. What can you infer about Leonardo's teachers fr om the last paragraph of the passage? f. They were afraid he would ask questions the y could not answer. g. They thought he was unable to learn. h. They thought he had no desire to learn. j. They believed he should try to get along w ith the other students. 13. The person or people who was/were most r esponsible for raising Leonardo was/were his a. father. b. mother. c. teachers. d. grandmother. 14. As he is depicted in the passage, Leonardo as a b oy can be described as f. popular among the other children. g. insensitive and cruel. h. a talented artist. j. eager to learn about what interested him. 15. It can be inferred from the passage that L eonardo I. did not mind being alone. II. was fascinated by flight. III. was popular with the other students. a. I and II only b. I, II, and III c. I o nly d. II only 16. What year was Leonardo rst sent to school? f. 1452 g. 1455 h. 1459 j. 1461 17. According to the passage, all the following are t rue EXCEPT: a. Leonardo enjoyed learning Latin grammar. b. Leonardo enjoyed learning math. c. Leonardo enjoyed studying nature. d. Leonardo was curious about the way things w orked. 44 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 18. Which of the following statements best sums up w hat is meant by lines 76-79 (Much as he loved the flowers he must pull their petals off, one by one, to see how each was joined, to wonder at the dusty pollen, and touch the honey-covered stamens)? f. Leonardo's desire to learn how things w orked was not stronger than his affection for nature. g. Leonardo's love of flowers drove him to d estroy them. h. Leonardo revered all of nature. j. Leonardo's curiosity led him to destructive a cts. 19. When Leonardo's father punished him, his r eaction could be best described as a. anger. b. resignation. c. spite. d. sadness. 20. According to the passage, one reason Leonardo skip ped school was f. he knew his grandmother would not punish him. g. the other students taunted him. h. Latin grammar bored him. j. he had no interest in any school subjects. Passage III\u2014Social Studies This passage is adapted from How the Other Half Lives, by Jacob A. Riis, 1890. The word tenements used throughout the passage refers to rental apartments that are generally of substandard quality. 1 Long ago, it was said that \"one half of the world 2 does not know how the other half lives.\" That 3 was true then. The half that was on top cared 4 little for the struggles, and less for the fate of 5 those who were underneath, so long as it was 6 able to hold them there and keep its own seat. 7 There came a time when the discomfort and 8 crowding below were so great, and the conse- 9 quent upheavals so violent, that it was no lon- 10 ger an easy thing to do, and then the upper half 11 fell to wondering what was the matter. Infor - 12 mation on the subject has been accumulating 13 rapidly since, and the whole world has had its 14 hands full answering for its old ignorance. 15 In New York, the youngest of the world's 16 great cities, that time came later than elsewhere, 17 because the crowding had not been so great. 18 There were those who believed that it would 19 never come; but their hopes were vain. Greed 20 and reckless selshness delivered similar results 21 here as in the cities of older lands. \"When the 22 great riot occurred in 1863,\" reads the testi- 23 mony of the Secretary of the Prison Association 24 of New York before a legislative committee 25 appointed to investigate causes of the increase 26 of crime in the State twenty-ve years ago, 27 \"every hiding-place and nursery of crime dis- 28 covered itself by immediate and active partici- 29 pation in the operations of the mob. Those very 30 places and domiciles, and all that are like them, 31 are today nurseries of crime, and of the vices 32 and disorderly courses which lead to crime. By 33 far the largest part\u201480% at least\u2014of crimes 34 against property and people are perpetrated by 35 individuals who have either lost connection 36 with home life, or never had any, or whose 37 homes had ceased to afford what are regarded 38 as ordinary wholesome influences of home and 39 family. . . . The younger criminals seem to come 40 almost exclusively from the worst tenement 41 house districts, that is, when traced back to the 42 very places where they had their homes in the 43 city here.\" One thing New York was made sure 44 of at that early stage of the inquiry: the bound- 45 ary line of the Other Half lies through the 46 tenements. 47 It is ten years and over, now, since that - 48 line divided New York's population evenly. 45 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 46 Today three fourths of New Yorkers live in the tenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the cities is only increasing those numbers. The fifteen thousand tenant houses in the past generation have swelled into thirty-seven thousand, and more than twelve hundred thousand persons call them home. The one way out\u2014rapid transit to the sub-urbs\u2014has brought no relief. We know now that there is no way out; that the \"system\" that was the evil offspring of public neglect and pri-vate greed is here to stay, forever a center of our civilization. Nothing is left but to make the best of a bad bargain. The story is dark enough, drawn from the plain public records, to send a chill to any heart. If it shall appear that the sufferings and the sins of the \"other half,\" and the evil they breed, are but as a fitting punishment upon the community that gave it no other choice, it will be because that is the truth. The boundary line lies there because, while the forces for good on one side vastly outweigh the bad\u2014not other-wise\u2014in the tenements all the influences make for evil; because they are the hotbeds of the epidemics that carry death to rich and poor alike; the nurseries of poverty and crime that fill our jails and courts; that throw off forty thousand human wrecks to the island asylums and workhouses year by year; that turned out in the last eight years a round half million beg-gars to prey upon our charities; that maintain a standing army of ten thousand panhandlers with all that that implies; because, above all, they touch the family life with deadly moral poison. This is their worst crime, inseparable from the system. That we have to own it, the child of our own wrong, does not excuse it, even though it gives it claim upon our utmost patience and tenderest charity. 21. The main idea of the rst paragraph is that a. the rich do not care about the poor until their own lives are affected. b. the rich know nothing about the lives of the poor. c. the rich and the poor lead very different lives. d. the poor revolted against the rich. 22. According to the passage, the other half refers to f. the rich. g. criminals. h. children. j. the p oor. 23. According to the Secretary of the Prison Asso-ciation, the main reason for increased crime was a. younger criminals. b. a lack of decent housing for the poor. c. the wealthy people's indifference to the poor. d. a shortage of prisons. 24. At the time the passage was written, how many people lived in tenement housing? f. more than 120,000 g. 37,000 h. 15,000 j. more than 1,200,000 25. As it is used in line 30, the word domiciles most closely means a. dome-shaped. b. prisons. c. living places. d. orphanages. 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 - - IIIACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 26. In the third paragraph, the statement It is ten y ears and over, now, since that line divided New York's population evenly (lines 47-48) best means that f. tenements are no longer located in one area o f the city. g. the crimes of the poor affect the rich. h. more than half of New York's population li ves in poverty. j. the poor no longer live only in tenements. 27. According to the author, the only way for the p oor to successfully escape poverty is a. nothing\u2014there is no escape. b. by moving to the suburbs. c. through hard work. d. through crime. 28. According to the last paragraph, the following stat ement(s) about tenements is/are true: I. They foster illegal activity. II. They spread disease to the rich. III. Rich and poor alike may nd themselves li ving there. f. I o nly g. II only h. I and II j. I, II, and III 29. According to the author, crime committed by the p oor a. is not as widespread as the government c laims. b. is unavoidable, considering their living c onditions. c. is a problem that should be dealt with har shly. d. should be ignored because of their inh umane living conditions. 30. It can be inferred from the passage that the au thor's opinion of the poor is f. sympathetic. g. hostile. h. indifferent. j. objective. Passage IV\u2014Natural Science This passage is taken from a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser - vice pamphlet titled \"Migration of Birds,\" by Frederick C. Lincoln, 1935. 1 The changing picture of bird populations 2 throughout the year intrigues those who are 3 observant and who wish to know the source 4 and destination of these birds. While many spe- 5 cies of sh, mammals, and even insects under - 6 take amazing migratory journeys, birds as a 7 group are the most mobile creatures on Earth. 8 Even humans with their many vehicles of loco- 9 motion do not equal some birds in mobility. 10 No human population moves each year as far as 11 from the Arctic to the Antarctic with subse- 12 quent return, yet the arctic terns do. 13 Birds are adapted in their body structure 14 and physiology to life in the air. Their feathered 15 wings and tails, bones, lungs and air sacs, and 16 their metabolic abilities all contribute to this 17 amazing faculty. These adaptations make it 18 possible for birds to seek out environments 19 most favorable to their needs at different times 20 of the year. This results in the marvelous phe- 21 nomenon we know as migration\u2014the regular, 22 recurrent, seasonal movement of populations 23 from one geographic location to another and 24 back again. 25 Throughout human experience, migra- 26 tory birds have been important as a source of 27 food after a lean winter and as the harbinger of 28 a change in seasons. The arrival of certain spe- 29 cies has been heralded with appropriate 47 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 30 ceremonies in many lands. Among the Eskimos 31 and other tribes this phenomenon is the 32 accepted sign of the imminence of spring, of 33 warmer weather, and a reprieve from winter 34 food shortages. The European fur traders in 35 Alaska and Canada offered rewards to the 36 Native American who saw the rst flight of 37 geese in the spring, and all joined in jubilant 38 welcome to the newcomers. As North America 39 became more thickly settled, the large flocks of 40 ducks and geese, as well as migratory rails, 41 doves, and woodcock that had been hunted for 42 food became objects of the enthusiastic atten- 43 tion of an increasing army of sportsmen. Most 44 of the nongame species were also found to be 45 valuable as allies of the farmer in his never - 46 ending confrontation against insect pests and 47 weed seeds. And in more recent years, all spe- 48 cies have been of ever-increasing recreational 49 and esthetic value for untold numbers of peo- 50 ple who enjoy watching birds. We soon realized 51 that our migratory bird resource was an inter - 52 national legacy that could not be managed 53 alone by one state or country and that all 54 nations were responsible for its well-being. The 55 need for laws protecting game and nongame 56 birds, as well as the necessity to regulate the 57 hunting of diminishing game species, followed 58 as a natural consequence. In the management 59 of this wildlife resource, it has become obvious 60 that studies must be made of the species' habits, 61 environmental needs, and travels. In the United 62 States, the Department of the Interior recog- 63 nized the value of this resource and is devoted 64 to programs that will ensure sustainability for 65 these populations as they are faced with the 66 impacts of alteration in land use, loss of habitat, 67 and contaminants from our technological soci-68 ety. Hence bird investigations are made by the 69 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the arm of the 70 Department of Interior charged by Congress 71 und er the Migratory Bird Treaty Act with the 72 duty of protecting those avian species that in 73 their yearly journeys pass back and forth 74 between the United States and other countries. 75 In addition, the federal government through 76 the activities of the Biological Resources Divi- 77 sio n of the U.S. Geological Survey also pro- 78 mot es basic research on migration. Federal 79 agencies cooperate with their counterparts in 80 other countries as well as with state agencies, 81 academic institutions, and nongovernmental 82 groups to gain understanding and for the pro- 83 t ection of migratory species through such 84 endeavors as Partners in Flight, a broadly based 85 international cooperative effort in the Western 86 Hemisphere. 87 For almost a century the Fish and Wildlife 88 Service and its predecessor, the Biological Sur - 89 v ey, have been collecting data on the important 90 details of bird migration. Scientists have gath- 91 e red information concerning the distribution 92 and seasonal movements of many species 93 throughout the Western Hemisphere, from the 94 Arctic Archipelago south to Tierra del Fuego. 95 Supplementing these investigations is the work 96 of hundreds of United States, Latin American, 97 and Canadian university personnel and volun- 98 t eer bird-watchers, who report on the migra- 99 t ions and status of birds as observed in their 100 respective localities. This data, stored in eld 101 notes, computer les, and scientic journals, 102 constitutes an enormous reservoir of informa- 103 t ion pertaining to the distribution and move- 104 me nts of North American birds. 105 The purpose of this publication is to sum- 106 mar ize this data and additional information 107 from other parts of the world to present the 108 more important facts about our current under - 109 standing o f the fascinating subject of bird 110 migration. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is 111 grateful to the many people who have 48 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 112 contributed their knowledge so that others, 113 whether in biology or ornithology classes, 114 members of conservation organizations, or just 115 individuals interested in the welfare of the 116 birds, may understand and enjoy this precious 117 resource as well as preserve it for generations 118 to come. 31.

The passage states that all of the following are thr eats to migratory bird populations EXCEPT f. pollution. g. hunting. h. loss of habitat. j. insect pests. 37. As it is used in line 32 of the passage, the word immine nce most nearly means a. importance. b. celebration. c. close arrival. d. warmth. 38.

Passage I\u2014Data Representation The earth's gravitational force produces a downward acceleration of 9.8 m/s 2 on all objects near the earth's surface. Other forces, including those produced by wind and aerodynamic lift, as well as jet, rocket, inter - nal combustion or other engines may also exert up ward or downward forces on these objects. These other forces, acting in combination with gravity, can cause a net force greater than or less than gravity, and, therefore, a net acceleration different from the down- ward acceleration of 9.8 m/s 2 caused by gravity. Table 1 and Figure 1 provide information about the vertical velocities measured for three different objects without regard to the horizontal motion of the objects. Each of the objects is operating under the influence of gravity for the entire 45 seconds being studied. They each may also be influenced by other vertical forces for all or part of that period. Where other forces have been applied, they always begin and end at one of the 5-second intervals. Table 1 indicates the vertical velocities of the thr ee different objects as measured every 5 seconds. Positive velocities indicate motion upward, and nega- tive velocities indicate motion downward.

Passage III\u2014Conflicting Viewpoints A geneticist and a physiologist each explained what causes the wide variety of different height proles found among different countries and ethnic groups on the planet. The geneticist pointed to data such as that repre - sented by Figure 1. Each curve shows the reported dist ribution of the specied adult population over the spectrum of heights. One represents an estimate of global averages, and the other two are estimates for two countries. He argued that the distinctive height prole of each separate population grouping sup-ported the hypothesis that height is determined by ea ch gene pool. 53 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 Distribution of Adult Population by Height Adult Population Distribution Global Country A Country B 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 Figure 1 The physiologist said there were signicant differences between the global prole and those of the two countries in terms of nutritional and other health-related factors. She also pointed to estimated historical data. Table 1 and the bar chart in Figure 2 present an image of long-term trends in typical height. She argued that if genetics determined the height, no such change would occur.

Table 1 and Figure 2 present the same basic data as Figur e 1 but in different formats. b. For signicant time periods, some countries e xperience changes in typical adult height in approximately the same pattern as others. c.

Its purpose is to improve our understanding of the nature, including changes in quality and intensity, of solar radiation reaching our planet, by continuously monitoring the intensity of solar radiation by time and by frequency. Five different instruments are mounted in the sat ellite to achieve coverage of the desired spectrum range. Table 1 shows the instruments used and the wavelength (Q) range monitored by each.

A series of experiments involving pneumococci were conducted to determine whether and how these changes take place. In all three of the experiments described here, measures were taken to protect against contamina-tion from other bacteria throughout the course of the e xperiments. Experiment 1 A ve-year study was conducted of the prevalence of ea ch type of pneumococcus found in pneumonia vic- tims. Table 1 shows the results. For the purpose of simplicat ion, the pneumococcal types I through VI referred to here do not necessarily correspond either to those used in the original study or to those in cur - rent usage. 60 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 TABLE 1 TYPES OF P NEUMOCOCCI IN P NEUMONIA CASES NUMBER % % % % TIME P ERIOD OF CASES T YPE I TYPE II TYPE III TYPE IV 04/1920-01/1922 151 30.6 32.6 6.6 30.0 02/1922-10/1924 61 42.6 21.3 3.2 32.7 11/1924-03/1927 67 34.3 7.4 4.4 53.7 Experiment 2 A subsequent study was conducted to determine what hap pens to strains of pneumococci in a disease vic- tim. It examined changes both to the pneumococci inf ecting the victim and to those extracted from the victim. First, samples were taken from a patient who was init ially analyzed to be infected only with type I pneu- mococci. Cultures were grown from these samples in three ways and analyzed. The rst was simply to grow ba cterial colonies from the sample in petri dishes. The second was to examine what happened when the same bacteria infected others. Mouse A was inoculated with untreated infected material. Then mouse B was inocu - lated with type I serum, which kills type I bacteria, and w ith the infected material from the patient. Table 2 reports those results. (Note: each day a different mouse B and mouse A were used.)

These c olonies were cultured in laboratory conditions to eliminate uncertainties of the previous experiments. All of these colonies were of rough (R) bacteria. Bac-teria can be divided into smooth or encapsulated (S) and rough or unencapsulated (R). The smooth, encapsulated bacteria are the most dangerous because they are coated with material that protects them from ant igens. The rough, unencapsulated bacteria are usually harmless. In each case, a mouse was inoculated with R ba cteria from the colony. The mice either died after between 2 and 12 days or survived indenitely. The blood of each deceased mouse was then cultured and tested for pneumococci that were examined to deter - mine whether they were R or S bacteria. Table 3 r eports the results.

Consider the results reported in Table 2. Which o f the following statements about the samples taken directly from the patient and culture is correct and important for the study? f. The patient was cured by day 19. g. Although the patient started with evidence o f only type I infection, that disappeared, to be replaced by rst type IV and then type VI infection. h. The type I bacteria died of overpopulation aft er day 6. j. Type IV bacteria are the mildest of those in volved with this disease. 27. Based on the overall ndings reported by Table 2, which of the following answers is most correct? a. The mice became infected with whatever ba cteria the patient was infected with when the sample was taken. b. The appearance of type VI bacteria indicates that the disease has r un its course. c. Bacteria change by escalating from lower t ypes to higher types. d. The type of bacteria changes both in the pat ient and in the mice inoculated with the patient's infection, without any clear relationship between the two. 62 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 28. From the standpoint of understanding how ba cterial strains change over time, what is the most interesting thing about the results reported in Table 3? f. Any of the mice survived. g. All of the bacterial strains, without e xception, changed from R to S. h. There was only one fatality in the mice ino culated with strains 4 and 6, and that took much longer than the deaths caused by the other strains. j. All of the bacterial strains extracted and t ested exhibited a change from R to S. 29. Which answer is the most important statement s upported by the data reported from the three experiments? a. All bacteria are potential killers. b. Pneumococcus strains do apparently shift Passage VI\u2014Data Representation Variations in the proportion of the two major iso-topes of oxygen, 18O and 16O, in seawater or land- based water, including glacial ice, are believed to be a proxy for changes in temperature. 16O is lighter than 18O, so it evaporates rst from seawater. This leaves a higher concentration of 18O in seawater and a lower concentration in the evaporated water, which then falls to Earth as precipitation. If the falling water freezes, glaciers are formed, which trap the low 18O precipitated water. In glacial periods, oceans are richer in 18O, but in interglacial periods the glaciers melt and 16O-rich water flows back into the oceans. For this reason high 18O concentrations in seawater are believed to be an indication of cold climate peri- ods in which glaciers are built up. The measure of how far above normal the con- centration of 18O in a sample is is called I18O. It is computed as follows: their characteristics signicantly 18 Osample 18 Onormal I18O = \u00f7 \u00d71, 000 and it is possible to learn about the 116 Osample 16 Onormal conditions under which this happens. c. Mice are more susceptible to disease than h umans. d. Bacteria undergo random mutations that we cannot p redict. 30. Which statement is best supported by the data in T able 2, viewed in conjunction with the other data? f. A single type of bacterium infects the victim and the n reproduces until it kills the patient or the patient kills it. g. The progress of the disease involves changes not o nly in the intensity but also in the nature of the infection. h. The bacterial strain causing the infection w ill tend to destroy itself. j. The bacteria can never be completely e liminated. Thus high I18O means more 18O and less 16O than normal. Low I18O is the reverse. Figure 1 illustrates the I18O cycle from seawater to the atmosphere to glaciers on land and back to seawater. 63 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 Precipitation Permanent ice Glacial ice Land Glacial meltEvaporation Ocean High 18O Low 18O 18O (Density of 18O) Figure 1 Low I18O water evaporates from the ocean, leaving higher I18O water behind. The evaporated water falls as precipitation, f orming low I18O glaciers. In interglacial periods, the glaciers melt, and 16O flows back into the ocean, reducing I18O there. Figure 2 is a simplied representation of the c hanges in seawater I18O for the past 2,000,000 years. The high I18O periods are when 16O evaporates from the seawater and is frozen into glaciers. The low I18O periods are when the glaciers melt and return the 16O to the seawater. 64 \u0000 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 3 2 1 years from present Figure 2 31.

Protons and neutrons together form the n ucleus at the center of an atom. The much lighter electrons whirl around the nucleus in what are called shells, rings, orbits, or energy levels. The left-hand diagram in Figure 1 is a representation of this structure. Nucleus Atomic nucleus with electron rings Ring 1 2 electrons Ring 3 8 electrons Ring 2 8 electrons Ring 3 Ring 2 Ring 1 Capacity of each electron ring Figure 1 66 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 At right in Figure 1 is a representation of valency. Each electron ring has a normal electron capacity. The rst ring's capacity is two electrons. The other rings each have a capacity of eight electrons. Atoms tend to bring their outer rings to capacity through some kind of collaboration or exchange with other atoms. The valency of an atom is the number of sur - plus or decit electrons in its outer ring. Ionic bonding involves a combination of atoms ha ving only one or two electrons in their outer rings with others that need only one or two electrons to complete their outer rings. The rst type empty their i ncomplete outer rings by lending out their outer-ring electrons, and the second type borrow them to com-plete their outer rings. This is called ionic bonding b ecause the atoms become electrically charged ions. The attraction between the positive ions that give up their electrons and the negative ions that receive them helps to bind the resulting compound. Figure 2 shows how this works in the case of two c ommon substances, H2O and NaCl, water and salt.

In light of the information presented here, what is the best explanation for why it takes one sodium atom to form a com-pound with one chlorine atom, but it takes two h ydrogen atoms to form a compound with one oxygen atom? f. Hydrogen is atomic number 1, and sodium is 11. It takes more hydrogen atoms to balance the weight of oxygen than sodium atoms to balance chlorine. g. The electrons of sodium and chlorine total 28, which is an even number. Two hydrogen atoms are required to produce an even number of electrons with oxygen. h. Chlorine needs only one electron to c omplete its outer ring. Oxygen needs two. One sodium atom provides the one electron that chlorine needs, but it takes two hydrogen atoms to provide the two electrons that oxygen needs. j. Sodium and chlorine start with the same n umber of electron rings, but hydrogen has only one ring to oxygen's two. ACT Writing P ractice T est 1 You have 30 minutes to complete this essay. Remem-ber to: Address the specic topic and writing task. Create a well-organized response. Include developed supporting ideas and specic details. Use sentence variety and strong word choices. In an effort to reduce juvenile violence and crime, many towns have chosen to enforce cur - fews on minors under the age of 18. These cur - fews make it illegal for any minor to loiter, wander , stroll, or play in public streets, high- ways, roads, alleys, parks, playgrounds, or other public places between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. Supporters of the curfew believe that it will reduce community problems such as violence, grafti, and drugs. Those who oppose curfews for minors claim these laws violate the Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protec- tion and due process for U.S. citizens. They also believe that such curfews stereotype minors by presupposing that citizens under the age of 18 are the only people who commit crimes. In your essay, take a position on this question. Y ou may write about either of the two points of view given, or you may present a different point of view on the topic. Use specic reasons and examples to support your position. 69 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 70 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 71 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 Answers ACT English Practice Test 1 Passage I\u2014Sigmund F reud 1. d.

T his ties in the issues in the paragraph: mass production, moving into cities and towns, and large populations. Choice f is irrelevant, and choices h and j are related but off topic. 59. c. A ll of the topics are related to the Industrial Revolution, but the essay focuses on mass production, so this topic would be the most logical to add. 60. g. P aragraph 2 introduces the Industrial Revo- lution, and paragraph 1 begins to describe it. The two paragraphs should be reversed. Passage V\u2014 Science F iction 61. d. T his provides the proper separation of the modifying clause from the subject of the sentence. 62. h. T his choice corrects the sentence fragment and keeps the not only . . . but also construc- tion intact. 63. b. C hoice a incorrectly uses being; choice c includes superfluous commas and uses the past tense, though the genre still exists; and choice d sets off what is important in the sentence\u2014the name of the new genre\u2014in parentheses, indicating that it is not impor - tant. 64. g. T his provides a clear statement that agrees with the active tense explores. 65. c. T his avoids reusing the word works and pro- vides proper punctuation. 66. h.

The verb are agrees with characters, and the word order is appropriate. 74. f. T his is relevant and would show the current direction of the genre. It is appropriate because the paragraph is about looking ahead to the future of science ction and humankind. The quotation from Franken-stein might or might not be relevant; a sum-mary of Shelley's life would be out of place in this par agraph; and the author is unable to answer the questions in the paragraph\u2014 he or she can only make an educated guess. 75. b. T he introduction is too general to include a focus on the plot of Frankenstein, and because this novel marked the beginning of science ction, it is entitled to its own para-graph. It would be out of chronological o rder to place it anywhere after that. ACT Mathematics Practice Test 1 1. d.

If ( x - 3) is a factor of 3x2 - 11x + n, then (3x - a) must be a factor as well, where (-3)(-a) = n, and (-3)(3) + (-a)(1) = -11. Solve for a in the second equation, and a = -2, and then plug that value into the rst equation to solve for n. 56. k.

W hile this seems too complicated to be a linear graph, it is. Factor out an x in the numerator, and you are left with 3x + 3; the numerator and denominator x's cancel out. However, the graph is undened at x = 0, so there is a hole in the graph at that value. 59. e. Fir st, use algebra to solve for C in terms of A in the rst equation.

T he best way to handle this question is to go through the possible answers and eliminate the incorrect ones. The rst line states that there was nothing of the giant in Babbitt, which eliminates choice d, because he was not tall. Lines 15-16 say He was not fat, but he was well fed, which eliminates his being overweight (choice a) or skinny (choice b). 2. h. T he passage lists a number of occupations that Babbitt does not perform, but line 10 says what he does do: sell houses. 3. a. T he reader knows that, on this particular day, Babbitt is having a difcult time getting out of bed. Does this mean he is lazy? It could, but later we learn that the poker game he went to the night before may have something to do with his prolonged slum- ber. We are never given any indication that B abbitt works hard at his job, but lines 9-11 say he was nimble in the calling of selling houses for more than people could afford to pay; in other words, he was good at his job, but did not necessarily work hard at it. 4. j. T his question asks that you infer something about the relationship that Babbitt has with his wife by paying attention to how they interact. We know that they do not openly dislike each other because Babbitt's wife tries to wake him by cheerfully calling him Georgie boy (lines 90-91). But in the same lines Babbitt refers to this cheerfulness as detestable to him, so we know his feelings are not romantic and passionate, but that Babbitt has strong feelings about his wife (thus eliminating choices f and h as possible answers). Lines 78-79 come the closest to stating Babbitt's feeling toward his wife (and family), saying that he disliked them and disliked himself for feeling that way. 77 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 5. d. T he biggest clue that the meaning of patina is color is the fact that the word gold imme- diately precedes it. 6. g. T here are many things that wake Babbitt from his sleep, but the rst one can be found on line 39. We know that the noise of the milk truck wakes him because the next line is Babbitt moaned; turned over; struggled back toward his dream. All the other options may have woken Babbitt, but choice g is the rst and therefore correct. 7. a. I t is perfectly clear that Babbitt wishes to return to sleep, but this fact has nothing to do with his blanket. His blanket may indeed offer him warmth and comfort, but the pas-sage does not say as much, and we know that B abbitt bought this blanket for a camp- ing trip he never took. 8. f. W hen the alarm goes off, what keeps Bab- bitt in bed is stated in lines 77-78: He de tested the grind of the real-estate business. This makes it clear that Babbitt dislikes his job. Although the next line refers to his dis-like of his family, we cannot assume that he has ha d a ght with his wife (she seems cheerful enough when she calls him Georgie boy to wake him). We also learn in the lines immediately following that he went to a poker game where he drank beer and smoked cigars, so he may have a hangover. 9. b. Lines 28-29 g ive the best clues as to the meaning of Babbitt's dream. The fairy sees Babbitt as nobody else sees: a gallant youth, or young. He also escapes from his wife and friends who attempt to follow him in this dream (he is free). 10. f. T his question asks you to nd a more suc- cinct way of stating lines 63-66, which basi-cally say that, as a boy, Babbitt was more int erested in life. Even if you do not know what the word credulous means here, you can still assume that it is something differ - ent from the way he is now from the way the se ntence is phrased. We know that now he is not interested in life, or each new day. Passage II\u2014Humanities 11. d. A lthough it is true that Leonardo's father would punish him if he caught Leonardo skipping school (choice a), this is not what the question asked. You also know from the text that Leonardo continued to skip school (choice b), but whether his grandmother knew this would happen is irrelevant. The reason that his grandmother did not punish him can be found in line 94, where she says that she loves to see him happy. 12. f. B ecause the question refers only to the last paragraph, any opinions that Leonardo's teachers may have elsewhere in the text do not apply. It is true that Leonardo did not get along with the other students (choice j), but nowhere does it say that his teachers had any opinion on this. This is a basic inference question in that the last paragraph states that some of Leonardo's teachers dreaded his questions because they were sometimes more than they could answer (line 125). From this statement, you can infer that they were afraid they would not have the knowledge to answer his questions and therefore afraid he might ask questions they could not answer. 13. d. T he text mentions many people as having something to do with raising Leonardo, but lines 34-35 state It was the old grandmother, Mona Lena, who brought Leonardo up. 78 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 14. j. A lthough you may already know that Leon- ardo da Vinci was a talented artist, this is not me ntioned in the text, which means that choice h is incorrect. Lines 52-54 show that Leonardo spent the time he skipped school studying nature, which was what interested him. 15. a. W hen Leonardo was punished for skipping school (lines 104-106), his father locked him in the cupboard, and instead of protest- ing, he soon found himself lost in his own thoug hts. This is how the reader knows that he did not mind being alone; therefore statement I is true. Lines 68-72 show that Leonardo was fascinated by birds and the secret power in their wings, which makes statement II correct. Lines 43-44 describe Leonardo as not enjoying the company of other boys, from which one can reasonably infer he was not popular, which makes state-ment III incorrect. 16. h. T he only date mentioned specically in the passage is 1452, which was the year of Leo- nardo's birth. Lines 41-42 state he was seven years old when he was sent to school, which would make the year 1459. 17. a. T his question asks you to distill a lot of information about Leonardo as a boy and nd the one fact that is incorrect. In lines 48-49, it says that Leonardo found Latin grammar a terrible task, which makes choice a correct. 18. j. T he lines referred to in the question describe an aspect of Leonardo's personality, but the question asks you to sum up exactly what that aspect is. The line says he loved the flowers, but he still pulled off their petals because he wanted to understand how each was joined. Therefore, his desire to learn how things worked led him to destructive acts. 19. b. Lines 111-119 d escribe Leonardo's reaction to his punishment. Specically, it says that he did not kick the door (was not angry), and that he only briefly felt it was unfair to be punished. The best way to describe his reaction was that he accepted it and occu- pied himself with his own thoughts, or r esigned himself to his punishment. 20. h. W e know that many of the answers in this question are, in fact, true statements, but they do not answer the question. He may have known that his grandmother would not punish him, but nowhere does it say this had anything to do with his motivation to skip school. The answer can be found in lines 48-49, which state that Latin grammar was a terrible task and continues to state that he therefore skipped school. Passage III\u2014Social Studies 21. a. T he rst part of the paragraph explains how the rich were unaware of the plight of the poor and therefore did not care: \"one half of the world does not know how the other half lives.\" That was true then (lines 1-3). But the paragraph goes on to say that it was only when conditions became so bad that it became no longer an easy thing for the rich to ignore the poor (lines 9-10). Although choices b, c, and d may be correct state- ments, they do not summarize the main id ea of the whole paragraph. 22. j. T he meaning of this phrase can be found throughout the passage, but because the passage is from How the Other Half Lives and it is about the conditions of the poor, one can reasonably assume it refers to the poor. 79 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 23. b. For this question it is important to sift through a lot of details to get to the main point of the statement, which is that a majority of crimes are committed by those whose homes had ceased to afford what are regarded as ordinary wholesome influences of home and family (lines 36-39). In other words, without good housing, there can be a lack of good family values, which in turn leads to increased crime. 24. j. T here are a lot of numbers mentioned in the passage, but the number specically attributed to the number of people living in tenement housing can be found in lines 54-55, more than twelve hundred thousand persons call them home, or 1,200,000. 25. c. B ecause the secretary's statement refers to the living environment of the poor, it can be assumed that the word domiciles can be dened as living places. 26. h. T he word line refers to the sentence imme- diately preceding the one in the question: the bo undary line of the Other Half lies through the tenements (lines 44-46). It is important to nd and understand this refer - ence before you can make sense of the ques-tion. Here the line refers to those living in t enements. Therefore, if the line no longer divides the population evenly, more than half live in poverty. 27. a. T he only reference in the entire passage to an escape from poverty can be found in lines 56-57, The one way out\u2014rapid transit to the suburbs\u2014has brought no relief. But because it has brought no relief and the state- ment immediately following reads we know no w that there is no way out, you can infer that the author believes there is no way to escape poverty. 28. h. T he statement in lines 75-76, the nurseries of poverty and crime that ll our jails and courts make statement I true, and immedi-ately prior to that statement it says the tene-ments are the hotbeds of the epidemics that car ry death to rich and poor alike (lines 73-75), making statement II true. There is no reference to rich living in tenements in the passage; therefore, statement III is incorrect. 29. b. T he easiest way to answer this type of ques- tion, which really refers to the entire pas-sage, is to eliminate answers you know are w rong. The author makes no statement that crime is overreported, nor does he say how criminals should be punished, or whether they should be punished at all; therefore, choices a, c, and d are incorrect. Through- out the passage, crime is blamed on life in the t enements. 30. f. T he rst clue that the author is not being objective is that he uses words like greed and reckless selshness (lines 19-20). And because the author says that poverty is inescapable in lines 57-58 (We know now that there is no way out), one can only con-clude that his opinion is sympathetic. Passage IV\u2014N atural S cience 31. b. Lines 11-12 stat e that every year the arctic tern migrates from the Arctic to the Antarctic with subsequent return. 32. g. A lthough the body structure of birds is well suited to migration, it is not the reason they migrate. Lines 17-20 state that this makes it possible for birds to seek out environments most favorable to their needs at different times of the year. 80 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 33. a. Lines 37-38 state that when the rst migrat- ing geese were spotted, the fur traders and Native Americans al l joined in jubilant wel- come to the newcomers. Therefore, it can be inferred that their relationship was a friendly one. 34. f. There are many groups mentioned in asso-ciation with the migrating birds, but lines 68-69 (bird investigations are made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) is where you will nd the answer to this question. 35. c. Lines 87-90 explain that the role of the Bio-logical Survey was to collect data on migrat-ing birds before the Fish and Wildlife Service was established. 36. j. Lines 43-47 state that birds ate the insects that were troublesome to farmers; therefore, the insects were not threats to the birds. 37. c. The preceding lines explain how the arrival of the birds signaled a change in season and the start of celebrations; therefore, even if you do not know the meaning of the word, you can assume that the imminence of spring means that spring was soon to arrive. 38. h. A lthough the European fur traders appreci- ated the migrating birds, they did so because the b irds indicated the arrival of spring. Fur traders were also around before the increas-ing population of North America referred to in lines 38-39. 39. a. I mmediately preceding the statement that We soon realized that our migratory bird r esource was an international legacy (lines 50-52) is a list of reasons people appreci-ated the migrating birds, and it does not inc lude their being a source of food. 40. j. I f you read only the beginning of the next to last paragraph, you might think the answer is choice g, but if you continue reading, you learn that many others help the Fish and Wildlife Service. ACT Science Practice Test 1 Passage I\u2014Data R epresentation 1. d. T he force of gravity produces an accelera- tion of -9.8 m/s2. This means that the veloc- ity must change by -49 m/s every 5 seconds b ecause 5 \u00d7 -9.8 = -49. Object 3 begins with an upward velocity of 490 m/s but is reduced by exactly 49 m/s during every 5-second interval shown. None of the other objects consistently experiences a change in velocity of -49 m/s every 5 seconds. Object 1 has a positive change of 51 m/s in the rst 5 seconds. Object 2 operates under the influence of gravity alone for 15 seconds but then between seconds 15 and 20 has a posi- tive change in velocity of 1 m/s. 2. g. F or at least part of the period shown, objects 1, 2, and 3 experience a change in velocity of -49 m/s every 5 seconds, which is the magnitude of change gravity causes. For object 1, this occurs between seconds 35 and 45.For object 2 this occurs from second 0 to se cond 15 and also from second 35 to sec- ond 45. Object 3 experiences a reduction of 49 m/s in v elocity every 5 seconds from sec- ond 0 to second 45. 3. d. C onstant acceleration means that the change in velocity for the period specied from second 5 to second 25 must always be the same. This is true for object 1 and object 3.Object 1 has an upward (positive) change in v elocity of 51 m/s every 5 seconds for the period being looked at. Object 3 has been shown to be operating only under the influ- ence of gravity, producing a change in v elocity of -49 m/s every 5 seconds for the entire period, including the one asked about here. Object 2 has a constant change of -49 m/s only for second 5 to second 15. It then changes to +1 m/s for second 15 to 35, so the change is not constant for the entire period specied. 81 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 4. f. In Table 1, downward velocity is represented by negative numbers, and upward velocity is represented by positive numbers. Therefore, everything below the zero line in Figure 1 represents downward motion, and every-thing above represents upward motion, r egardless of which direction the line on the graph is headed. When the graph line crosses 0, this indicates that the direction of the object changes at that point. A positive change in the direction of the line on the graph indicates a positive change in velocity. If the line is below zero, this means that the object moves downward but at decreasing speed. If the line is moving upward above zero, this means the object is moving upward at an increasing speed. Only answer choices f and g state that the object is traveling downward at second 0. This is correct because the graph line b egins at -100. Figure 1 indicates that the object reaches zero velocity at approxi - mately 10 seconds. Changing from negative t o positive velocity means it changes direc - tion from downward to upward. Table 1 i ndicates that that point is a bit before sec - ond 10 since it is already traveling upward a t 2 m/s by second 10. We can calculate that the change in direction occurs at 9.8 sec - onds. Answer choice f correctly states that t he object's speed decreases after second 30 as indicated by the downward slope in Fig - ure 1 and the decreasing numbers in Table 1. Answer choice c , w hich is correct until that point, incorrectly states that the object's speed continues to increase. 5. c. F or the period from second 15 to second 35, object 2 has a positive change in velocity of 1 m/s every 5 seconds. An upward force slightly greater than the force of gravity is required to produce this small upward acceleration. Answer choice c, which points to a counterforce capable of producing a 10 m/s 2 upward acceleration against gravity's -9.8 m/s2, is the only one that could be even approximately correct, so it is the best answer. To calculate the answer precisely, rst divide the results reported for each 5 seconds by 5 to convert them to 1-second-interval results. This shows that instead of the 9.8 m/s 2 downward acceleration due to gravity, object 2 experienced +0.2 m/s2 upward acceleration due to the unknown force. Add 0.2 m/s 2 to 9.8 m/s2 to calculate the correct acceleration level, which is 10 m/s 2. Answer choice a is incorrect because object 2 has not leveled o f. Its velocity has nearly leveled off, but it is still falling at nearly 100 m/s. Answer choice d is incorrect because the changes in gravitational force due to even the most extreme terrain changes are far too small to produce the result described. Passage II\u2014Resear ch Summary 6. h. T he reaction involves one molecule of each substance. Since a mole of any substance has the same number of particles as a mole of any other substance, this reaction requires the same number of moles of each. 7. b. M ultiply 0.1, the desired concentration in moles per liter, by 36.5, the mole mass of HCl, by 0.02 liters of solution. 82 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 8. j. T he tables show only the pH levels for every 0.25 ml of titrant added. pH 7.0 does not o ccur at any of those precise points. Answer choice j is based on estimating the actual titrant volume at the point pH 7.0 is reached. Answer choice f is less accurate than choice j because it gives the volume of the titrant only to the closest 0.25 ml shown on the table. Answer choices g and h give the results in the wrong order. 9. a. T he table shows that at least 30 ml were added in each trial. We do not know if the trial ended at that point. 10. h. N aCl is a product of the reaction. The NaOH titrant continued to be added after the reaction was complete, so NaOH will also be present. Answer choice j is incorrect because this reaction does not produce NH 3, and there is no indication of NH3 being present or being introduced into the solution. 11. b. M ultiplying the concentration of the titrant, given in moles/liter (M), by the number of liters used (c \u00d7 v) gives us the number of moles of NaOH in the titrant that were used in the reaction. This is also the number of moles of HCl used, because one molecule of HCl reacts with one molecule of NaOH. The mass of HCl is determined by multiply- ing the number of moles by the mole mass, w hich is 36.5 grams. The nal calculation is 0.2 moles/liter v liters \u00d7 36.5 grams/mole. Passage III\u2014Conflicting V iewpoints 12. h. T he highest concentration, indicated by the highest point of the distribution curve, is at about 153 cm for country A. 13. a. T he highest concentration, indicated by the highest point of the distribution curve, is at about 174 cm for country B. 14. h. A nswer choice h provides the most com- plete description of the similarities and dif-ferences. Answer choice f ignores the clear similarities between the curves, and choice j ignores the differences. Answer choice g misidenties the difference in shape as a difference in position. 15. b. T able 1 and Figure 2 accurately describe the time comparison shown, which consists of data absent from Figure 1. Answer choice a is incorrect because Figure 1 presents no data on change over time. Answer choice c is not supported by Figure 2. Answer choice d is incorrect because it is also supported by Figure 1. 16. f. I t reports what the chart indicates. Answer choice g is correct for most of the period shown but not for its entirety. For the period 1970 to 2010, country B's height increase is less than both the global increase and country A's increase. 17. d. F rom 1810 and 1830 and again from 1890 to 1930, country A's typical adult height was reduced. Answer choice a is incorrect because there was no point shown at which country B's adult height decreased. Answer choice b is incorrect because country A's overall progress in height has been inter - rupted by periods of decline. Answer choice c is incorrect because country A's adult height actually increased less than one-third as much as country B's. 18. h. T he right and left extremes of the curve, where the population distribution approaches zero, is nearly identical in each of the curves. Answer choices f, g, and j are not supported by the data given. 83 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 Passage I V\u2014R esearch S ummary 19. b. T ranslated from scientic notation to stan- dard notation, Table 2 looks like this: TABLE 2 WAVELENGT HS (Q ) IN N ANOMETERS OF E LECT ROMAGNET IC RADIA TION TYPE OF RADIATION F ROM Q T O Q gamma ray ? 0.001 x-ray 0.001 1.000 radio Te SIM covers part of the ultraviolet, visi- ble light, and infrared spectrums. SOLSTICE A and B each cover part of the ult raviolet range. XPS begins at 1 nm, which is the upper end of the x-ray range, and extends into the ultraviolet range. 20. f. T he highest level is 1,361.2513 W/m2, and the lowest is 1,361.0329 W/m2. The differ - ence is 0.2184 W/m2. Answer choice g is in the wrong units, and answer choices h and j are not even approximately correct. 21. d. T he proportion is approximately 2E - 1 divided by 1.6E + 3. That would have to be approximately ( 2 ) \u00d7 10-4. Answer choice d 1.6 is the only answer that approximates that. 22. h. T he wavelength in nanometers (nm) is shown on the x-axis, and the level of solar irradiance is shown on the y-axis. The high- est point is approximately 2.1 W/m2/nm (watts/meter2/nanometers). This occurs at a wavelength somewhat less than 500 nm. 23. b. T SI is measured in watts/meter2, which is a measure of power. SSI is a measure of the same power separated into different wave- length ranges. The denition of SSI given in answ er choice a has no denite meaning. Answer choices c and d refer to solar energy, but TSI and SSI are magnitudes of power, not energy. 24. g. T he largest area under the SSI curve occurs between approximately 400 and 700 nm, which is the visible light range. 25. c. A ccording to Figure 3, almost all of the irra- diance is delivered in the visible light, infra- red, and ultraviolet spectra. The magnitude o f irradiance delivered by the other types does not even appear clearly on the graph. The ultraviolet irradiance is dened by the small sliver of area under the curve between 0 and 400 nm. The infrared area from 700 to 2,500 nm is signicantly larger. Passage V\u2014 Research S ummary 26. g. A nswer choice g presents evidence of exactly what is being looked for: a change in the nature of the bacterial population. Answer choice f is not correct because we do not know why no culture was made on day 19. Answer choices h and j are conjectures for which there is no strong evidence presented in the table. 84 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 27. d. A nswer choice d indicates a fact relevant to the purpose of the study. The cultures taken directly from the patient showed rst type I, then type IV without type I, and then type VI without either type I or type IV. Type I dominated the results of the inoculated mouse A, but it did not appear in the day 15 or 17 samples. It then reappeared on day 19, along with type VI, but reappeared alone on day 21 even though the culture from the patient grew no colonies. Answer choice a is not correct. On days 4 and 6, mouse B was infected with types V and VI pneumococci, without any evidence that these were in the sample from the patient. On day 8 mouse A was infected with type VI, which did not appear in the patient until day 17. Answer choice b is not correct because that day's sample infected mouse A with both type I and type VI, and we are not even sure this patient, let alone most patients, was cured at the point of type VI's appearance. Answer choice c draws a conclusion based on how the bacterial types were numbered, rather than on the observed operation of the bac- teria. 28. j. T he consistency of this result is a strong indicator that the colonies do change their characteristics in a systematic way. Answer choices f and h indicate only that some strains are more virulent than others, but that is to be expected. Answer choice g incorrectly claims that all of the samples changed, but the surviving mice were not tested. 29. b. T he data here do not provide a solid theory concerning the cause of the changes observed, but there are clear patterns in the differences between the behavior of strains in culture, in the inoculated mice, and under the influence of type I serum that point to the possibility of expanding under - standing of the phenomena. Answer choices a and c are not supported by the data. Answer choice d is inaccurate. There are indications of nonrandom ordering, partic-ularly in experiment 3. 30. g. I t is important to be able to look at the data presented and draw conclusions from what seems to make sense based on other inputs. The idea that one stable form of bacteria is at work from the beginning to the end of this course of illness is refuted. Answer choice f is refuted by the data. Answer choice h is not supported. The original type I strain seems to have been weakened or transformed to others, but there is no evi-dence that it destroyed itself. There is also nothing t o support answer choice j. Passage VI\u2014Data Representation 31. c. A lways make sure you understand what each direction on the chart, table, or graph means. In this case, high 18O means cold climate and glaciation. The highest 18O level shown is about 2.5, which occurred at about -0.65 million years. 32. j. H igh sea levels occur when glaciers melt, lling the oceans with low 18O water. The lowest 18O level shown is about 2.8, which occurred at about -1.85 million years. Answer choice h is incorrect. The peak at 1.93 million years ago would indicate low seas, rich in 18O. 85 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 33. a. P eriods of glacial buildup are marked by peaks in 18O. There were three between -0.25 and -0.50 million years. 34. j. Gla cial melts dilute the high 18O seawater with 16O-rich glacial water, and are marked by low 18O seawater. Between -1.25 and -1.50 million years there are four 18O troughs. 35. b. T emperature swing is indicated by the dif- ference between the highest and lowest 18O levels. From -0.90 to -1.75 million years, 18O rose to 1 and no higher and then dropped to -1 and no lower, almost like clockwork. That is a range of only 2 between high and low. For the rest of the span of time shown, the 18O high levels were gen- erally above 1 and as high as 2.7. The lows w ere as low as -2.7. Passage VII\u2014Data Representation 36. j. T he tables show that the total charge for each substance is zero. Due to their electri-cal charge, ions tend to move away from lik e-charged ions and toward oppositely charged ions to form electrically neutral compounds. 37. a. Ele ctrons are negatively charged, so remov- ing one produces a charge of +1. 38. g. S odium has an atomic number 11, and, therefore, neutral sodium has 11 electrons. The rst ring has two and the second has eight. That leaves one electron to form the third ring. That electron is given up when sodium is ionized, leaving the rst two rings. 39. d. C hlorine needs just one electron to com- plete its outer ring of eight, and hydrogen is ab le to donate it. Ionic bonds are formed between atoms needing electrons to ll a nearly complete outer ring (positive valence) and those needing to get rid of atoms in a nearly empty outer ring (nega-tive valence). It might seem that an atom lik e chlorine could just as easily get rid of all seven of its outer ring electrons as acquire one, but that kind of reaction is very rare. 40. h. T he key in ionic bonding is not the number of atoms combined, but the number of elec-trons required or available to produce com-plete outer electron rings. Chlorine needs o nly one and sodium has one extra to pro- vide. Oxygen needs two, but hydrogen only has o ne per atom to provide. That is why water has two hydrogen atoms to donate electrons and salt has only one sodium atom. ACT Writing Practice Test 1 Sample \"S core 6\" E ssay Imagine your parents or grandparentsas teenagers: Do you think they wererunning around vandalizing movie the-aters and ripping off ice cream par-lors? Decades ago, our parents andgrandparents enjoyed parties and late-night diner runs as much as we dotoday. They were not out to scandal- ize their communities; they simply wanted to enjoy life. Yet now, thesesame freedom-loving people want tosuppress our freedom by enforcing alaw that would prevent any teen fromattending parties or working late toearn a little extra money. A curfew 86 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 for minors under the age of 18 not only will have little effect on crimerates, but also will wrongly restrictthe social life and employability of many teens. According to supporters of this legislation, enforcing a curfew onchildren under the age of 18 would\"reduce community problems such asviolence, graffiti, and drugs.\" There aremany problems with this statement.For instance, violence does not take place in a community only at night.The events at Columbine High Schoolin 1999 proved that violence can takeplace in broad daylight, and that theroot of this violence can sometimes begin at home. While graffiti is uglyand destructive, it is not done only in\"alleys, parks, or playgrounds.\" Thereare scribblings and drawings on manyof the desks and textbooks in myschool, yet they were done in the day-light and are just as destructive. Sim- ilarly, drugs are a problem in every community and do not discriminateagainst any type of student or time ofday. It is unfortunate but true that astudent can sell drugs just as easilyin school as he or she can in a parkat midnight. What this law is doing isnot eliminating these problems, butsimply shifting them to different pub-lic places during different times ofthe day. One argument of those opposed to this legislation is that \"curfewsstereotype minors by presupposingthat citizens under the age of 18 arethe only people who commit crimes.\"This is true. While many communityproblems can be attributed to minors, the same problems can also be attrib- uted to adults. This fact is sup- ported by the large number of men and women over the age of 18 in ourprison system. The community maysave money by keeping a few youngvandals or drug dealers out of juvenileprison, but they will certainly con- tinue to pay for those mature men and women who have chosen to sup- port themselves by selling drugs to minors in the first place. It should also be noted that while a curfew may keep minors under the age of 18from loitering and causing destruction,there is a group of young adultsbetween the ages of 18 and 21 thatcannot legally drink alcohol but stilldo. The curfew will do nothing tostop the destruction of property oreven lives that may result from thisaction. A curfew like this would only restrict the positive outlets manyteenagers have, such as healthy inter- action with their peers and work.Many teens have long days filled withschool and after-school activities such as sports or clubs, chores, andhomework. Most of my friends do noteven have a free moment until about 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. It is then thatmany teens go out and see a movie orvisit with friends. This curfew would all but prevent most teens from beingable to socialize with other teens in person. Teenagers would be relegatedto online and phone friendships.Another problem with this curfew isthat it would prevent many teens fromhaving a job, which many teens need.Many jobs for teenagers are at 87 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 fast-food restaurants where the late-night shifts are the only onesteens are able to get because they arein school all day long. This curfew would make it very difficult for teens to obtain jobs and earn money forcollege. Social interaction and workare both healthy experiences thatmake teens into good, productive com-munity members. This curfew wouldprevent that. Obviously, by encouraging this legislation, the supporters of thiscurfew feel they are protecting theirrights as well as those of the com-munity. The minors of previous gener-ations have grown up to be mature andresponsible citizens with legitimateconcerns about youth and community.While there may be more evils lurkingin society than in decades past, thesepeople must realize that putting atime limit on problems cannot solvethem. Perhaps instead of trying tocontain them, their time would be better spent finding the root of the crime, violence, and drug problems that are rampant in our society today. Byworking these troubles out instead oflocking them in, it is possible thatboth adults and minors may worktogether to make our community abetter place. Critique This essay shows an excellent and insightful under - standing of the prompt. It clearly addresses the p rompt. The student creates a clear and creative opening and closing, and the point of the essay is clear: the student disagrees with the curfew. The stu- dent maintains the focus of the paper by using well-developed paragraphs, as in paragraph 2, where the student states that There are many problems with this statement and gives several examples of these problems (violence does not take place in a community only at night; drugs are a problem in every community and do not discriminate against any type of student or time of day). The student uses counterarguments in paragraphs 2 and 3 to logically refute the opposition's opinion. The student uses transitions to smoothly join the paragraphs and examples together (According to supporters, A curfew like this, Obviously). The details and examples in the body paragraphs show that the student has carefully planned the argument. In addition to good content and organization, the essay uses strong vocabulary (scandalize, lurking). The sentences are varied and interesting, and there are few, if any, grammatical errors. Sample \" Score 5\" E ssay To try to reduce juvenile violence and crime, many towns have chosen toenforce curfews on minors under the age of 18. People who support thesecurfews believe they would lowercommunity problems such as vio-lence, graffiti, and drugs. People who oppose curfews for minors claim that these curfews stereotype minors by assuming that citizens under theage of 18 are the only people whocommit crimes. I actually think acurfew would be a good idea. A cur-few in our community would makethe community a safer, cleaner placeand would help build strongerfamilies. Many teens get into a lot of trouble late at night. They are outlate hanging around doing very littlethat is constructive. Teens who are out past 10:00 p.m. are more likely todrink alcohol, experiment with drugs, 88 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 and commit crimes such as vandalism and robbery. It's too hard for teensto resist peer pressure when it's lateand they are sleep-deprived. A curfewwould ensure that most teens are safely in there homes late at night.This way the teens themselves aresafer from peer-pressure and othercommunity members are safe fromteens who might do terrible thingswhile sleep-deprived or under the influence of drugs and alcohol. It's true that not every crime is commit-ted by a teenager, but if we can elimi-nate some crime with this curfew, it allows the police to concentrate onother people committing crimes.Either way, crime is reduced and thecommunity us safer. You may notice that teens are not the neatest people in the world. Mostteens rooms are a disaster area. Teens who are permitted to wander aimlesslyaround the neighborhood tend to cre- ate a mess. Even if they are not drink- ing alcohol, teens gathering in a parkor parking lot will tend to leave cans,food wrappers, and sometimes ciga-rette butts all over the place. Someteens deliberately cause a mess byoverturning garbage cans, spray paintingon buildings and fences, or breakingwindows. Of course, most teens are going to wait until the cover of nightto do this, so having a curfew wouldeliminate these problems. Finally, hav-ing a curfew would help build stron- ger families. Many teens go out and stay out all night long. They neverinteract with their parents or siblings.They think a night at home will be boring. But a curfew like this wouldforce teens to stay home with theirfamilies. At first it may seem liketorture, but if parents take advantageof it and create a warm, loving, funhome environment, teens will enjoystaying home and families will become stronger. Without the curfew, it's too difficult for parents to force their teens to stay at home; it becomes a source of arguments. If there were a curfew, the parents could \"blame\" it on the law. That way it doesn't feelso much like the parents are harass-ing the teenager. I think a curfew is agood idea. As a teenager myself I seethe trouble teens get into late atnight. I have a good time when I stayhome with my family and I'd like tosee other teens have this experience too. Critique This essay shows a good understanding of the prompt and shows some insight into the complexities of this issue. It has a clear thesis statement. The essay con-tains specic examples to support the thesis, showing ho w teenagers get into trouble late at night, and con- tains a counterargument in paragraph 2. Overall, the essa y is generally well organized; it uses clear logic with good transitions between ideas. The essay shows good command of written English with attempts at varying sentence structure and attempts at sophisti- cated vocabulary use that may not be as successful as the mo del score 6. 89 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 Sample \"S core 4\" E ssay Curfews for minors are a bad idea. Curfews make it illegal for minors tobe out in public between the hoursof 10 PM and 5 AM. These curfews are a bad idea for several reasons. If a minor is out after 10 PM, it does not mean that this minor is comiting acrime. People over the age of 18 com- mit crimes too. Sometimes it is nec- essary for a minor to be out after 10 PM for work and or friends. Also, just because a minor is out after 10PM doesn't mean he's a bad kid. He shouldn't get in trouble for not reallydoing anything bad. The people who want to create a curfew think that it'll create less crime in the community. It might dothat with some kids, sure, but it won't stop crime all together. If akid knows he has to be in by 10 PM hemight decide not to write graffiti onthe walls or hang out and do drugs,but that doesn't mean that other people won't. Old people commitcrimes too. Also, a kid can do drugsafter school at a friends house. He doesn't have to do it at night. He candraw or write on the sides of build- ings before 10 PM too. In the winter- time, it is dark outside at 7 PM. Kids will do the same things, they will justdo them earlier in the day. Sometimes, too, a minor needs to be out after 10 PM. For example a kidmight have a job that doesn't get outuntil 10 PM and than the kid needs to drive home. If he gets caught driving,he could get in trouble. Or what if heis at a friends house and they arejust having a fun time or doing there homework, not doing anything wrong or anything, but just hanging out. If heforgets what time it is and he leaves alittle too late he could get in trouble.That is not fair if he is a good kid. This brings me to my last point. If a minor gets in trouble for stayingout after the curfew it could ruin his reputation. He might be a goodstudent who wants to get a scholer-ship to college. He can't get a schol- ership with a police record. He was probably out late studying anyway ifhe's a smart kid. Maybe the peoplewho create these curfews could make some guidelines to follow sothat kids could stay out later if thereis a special event or for work orstudying. That would make it easier tofollow and good kids wouldn't get introuble. In conclusion, I think that curfews are a bad idea. They don'tchange anything and don't make kidsstop doing inapropriate things. Critique This essay is an adequate response. In the opening, the student states the main idea of the essay: Curfews for minors are a bad idea. The student then briefly outlines the content of the essay. The student contin- ues the focus throughout the essay, staying with the p osition of disagreeing with the curfew legislation, and develops the essay by attempting to give three distinct reasons. However, paragraphs 3 and 4 are quite similar and possibly could have been discussed in one paragraph. The student does attempt transi-tions between both sentences and paragraphs (Some-times, too; F or example; This brings me to my last point). Although this helps the organization of the essay, it does little to add to the development of the paragraphs, which is weak. Paragraph 2 gives several 90 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 details to support the student's opinion that curfews do not lessen crime in a community (Old people com-mit crimes too; a kid can do drugs after school; Kids will do the same things, they will just do them earlier in the day). However, paragraph 4 lacks solid details or examples to support the student's idea that a curfew could ruin a minor's reputation. There is only one sketchy detail (He can't get a scholership with a police record). This uneven development hinders the effec-tiveness of the essay. The student uses basic vocabulary and sentences, and makes several spelling and grammatical errors (scholership, just having a fun time or doing there home - work, at a friends house ) , but they do not interfere with the meaning of the essay. Sample \" Score 3\" E ssay I'm getting very tired of adults not trusting teenagers. This curfew ideajust adds to the problem. It's a ter-rible idea. People who want this curfew think that all teenagers are out tovandelize and cause trouble. That's not true. Some teens are trouble- makers but most aren't. Most teens are good kids. They want to go out atnight to have fun, not cause trouble.If we had a curfew teens would probably not be able to have muchfun. They would have to go in theirhouses so early that they wouldn'tbe able to really do anything. The curfew might keep the bad teens from doing bad things but itpunnishes the good teens at the sametime and that's not fair. The curfew would make it pratically immpossiblefor teens to have jobs and that alsowouldn't be fair. Teens can't reallyget a job at McDonalds if they can'twork passed 10:00pm. The whole problem is that adults don't trust teens and they should. Most teens are fine. Maybe only teens that have been bad should have the curfew instead of everyone. Critique This essay shows developing skill. The writer shows a c lear understanding of the assignment and takes a clear stand on the issue. The essay lacks adequate development, however. The ideas are very general and somewhat repetitive: Some teens are trouble-makers but most aren't. Most teens are good kids. They want to go out at night to have fun, not cause trouble. The essay has an adequate organization but lacks strong transi-tions between ideas. The essay shows some control of w ritten language but makes some obvious spelling errors (vandelize, punnishes) and lacks sophistication. Sample \" Score 2\" E ssay A curfew is when there is a time limit on when you can go out. Some- times a curfew can be good or bad. Its bad to have a curfew when you want to do something fun like go to a movie or out with friends. But a curfew could be good if it keeps youout of trouble, like if your drinking orsomething then youd have to stopbecause of the curfew. People thinkteens do bad things when their outlate at night and sometimes theirright, but ususally teens are justhanging out and that's not that bad. I think a curfew might be a good idea in bad arreas of town, but I wouldn't want to have a curfew even though I don't do bad things. Critique This essay shows a weak understanding of the p rompt. The writer does not take a clear stand on the 91 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 1 issue and offers no counterarguments. There are no transitions between ideas, and the ideas themselves are vague and confusing. It's difcult to tell whether the writer is for or against the curfew. The essay con- tains a number of grammatical and spelling errors that sho w a poor grasp of written language. Sample \" Score 1\" E ssay I dont think that kids are crimanales. My mom lets me stay out late and imnot a crimanale. I dont do drugs. sometimes policeman chais 14 yearolds down the street on tv butt Idont see that in my town becawsethey dont. besids, 14 yearolds get priv- leges. it says so in that adendmint. if you play your stero loud at night you might comit a crim becauseit is a minor but the police notchais you becawse of privleges. no one shud inforce laws on kids who are not crimanales. Critique This essay shows little or no understanding of the p rompt. The student confused much of the informa- tion. For example, the student confused the Four - teenth Amendment with 14-year-olds. The random and inappropriate details (sometimes policeman chais 14 yearolds down the street) weaken the attempt made by the student to establish the main idea stated in paragraph 1. The student writes about very few, if any, outside details. The student also makes severe grammatical errors that take away from the meaning of the essay and make it quite difcult to read (crima-nales, ade ndmint). 92 CHAPTER3 ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 This is the second of four complete practice ACTs in this book.

Passage I\u2014Wilma Rudolph Wilma Rudolph was born a premature child in 1940, in Clarksville, Tennessee. Weighing 1 only four and a half pounds. Wilma's mother did her best to care for her daughter, but the Rudolphs were very poor, and the local hospital would not care for Wilma. During her childhood, Wilma contracted measles, mumps, scarlet fever, chicken pox, pneumonia, and, later, polio, a crippling disease that at that time had no cure. At the age of four, doctors told her 2 she would never walk again. But Wilma's mother refused to give up. She f ound an African American medical college 50 miles away that would give Wilma the care she needs. 3 Although it was difcult to make the trip, Wilma's mother took Wilma to the col-lege twice a week. After two years of treatment, W ilma could walk with a brace. With her fami- ly's help, Wilma was able to walk by age 12 nor - mally without the aid of a crutch or brace.4 But simply walking wasn't enough for Wilma, who wanted to be5 an athlete. She decided to play basketball, and for three years she practiced6 with the team but didn't play in a single game. Then, in her sophomore year of high school, Wilma became a starting guard. For scoring she broke the state records 7 and led her team to the state championship. At the age of 16, she traveled to Melbourne, Australia, to run track events in the 1956 Olympics. She earned a bronze medal as part of a relay team. (1) After the high school from which she g raduated,8 Wilma was awarded a full scholar - ship to Tennessee State University, and her t rack career went into high gear. (2) Before she ha d earned9 her degree in education, she took a year off from her studies to compete all over the world. (3) In 1960, Wilma's career as a run-ner reached its apex. (4) She set a world record in the 200-me ter race at the Olympic trials,10 in Rome, she won the 100-meter race and the 200-meter race, and ran the anchor leg on the win-ning 4 \u00d7 100-meter relay team. (5) Wilma was p roudest of a different kind of victory, in con- clusion.11 (6) When she returned from her tri- umphs in Rome, she insisted that the ho mecoming parade held in her honor not be a segregated event. (7) This parade was the rst racially integrated event ever held in Clarksville. (8) Wilma continued to participate in protests unt il Clarksville's segregation laws were nally changed.12 1. a.

Passage II\u2014Bicycles (1) Today, bicycles are so common that it's hard t o believe they haven't always been around. (2) But 200 years ago, bicycles weren't even exist- ing,16 and the rst bicycle, invented in Germany in 1818, was nothing like our bicycles today\u2014it was made of wood and didn't even have pedals. (3) Since then, however, numerous innovations and imp rovements in design make17 the bicycle one of the most popular means of recreation and transportation around the world. (4) In 1839, Kirkpatrick Macmillan a Sc ottish blacksmith18 dramatically improved upon the original bicycle design. (5) Macmil-lan's machine had tires with iron rims to keep the m from getting worn down. (6) He also used foot-operated cranks similar to pedals so his bicycle could be ridden at a quick pace. 19 (7) It hadn't looked20 much like a modern bicycle, though, because its back wheel was substan-tially larger than its front wheel. (8) In 1861, the F rench Michaux brothers took the evolution of the bicycle21 a step further by inventing an improved crank mechanism. (9) Ten years later, James Starley, an Eng- lish inventor, revolutionized bicycle design. (10) He, made22 the front wheel many times larger than the back wheel, putting a gear on23 the pedals to make the bicycle more efcient, and lightened the wheels by using wire spokes. (11) While much lighter and less tiring to ride, most p eople found that24 the bicycle was still clumsy, extremely top-heavy, and ridden mostly for entertainment. (12) It wasn't until 1874 that the rst truly mo dern bicycle appeared on the scene. (13) Today there built,25 used, and enjoyed all over the world. (14) H.J. Lawson, invented by anothe r Englishman,26 the \"safety bicycle\" would look familiar to today's cyclists. (15) This bicycle had equal-sized wheels, which made it less prone to toppling over. (16) Lawson also attached a chain to the pedals to drive the rear wheel. (17) With these improvements, the bicy-cle became extremely popular and useful for easy transport. 27 16. f.

Part of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, the arch is a really cool mo nument32 built to honor St. Louis's role as the gateway to the West. Construction on the 630-foot-high struc- ture, began in 1961,33 and was completed four years later in 1965. The monument includes an underground visitor center that explores west-ward expansion through galleries and a theater. T wo passenger tram takes visitors34 to the observation room and the Museum of West- ward Expansion at the top. (1) In 1947, a group of interested citizens kno wn as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Association held a nationwide com- petition to select a design for a new monument that would celebrate35 the growth of the United States. (2) Other U.S. monuments are spires, statues, or imposed buildings, 36 but the winner of this contest was a plan for a completely unique structure. (3) The man that 37 submitted the winning design, Eero Saarinen, later went o n to become38 a famous architect. (4) In designing the arch, Saarinen wanted to \"create a monument which would have lasting signi-cance and would be a landmark of our time.\" (5) Saarinen helped create the international imag e of the United States with many of its39 designs. (6) He also designed the General Motors Technical Center in Detroit, Michigan, and the TWA Terminal at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. The Gateway Arch is a masterpiece of e ngineering, a monument even taller than the Great Pyramids in Egypt, and on its own way,40 at least as majestic. The arch is an inverted cate-nary curve, the same shape that a heavy chain will form if suspended between two points. Covered from top to bottom with a sleek stain- less steel coating, 41 sunlight often reflects off of the arch in dazzling bursts.42 In a beautiful dis- play of symmetry, the height of the arch is the same as the distanc e between the legs at ground level. 31. a.

The writer has been asked to write a short essay d escribing in detail a national monument and what the monument honors. Would this essay fulll that assignment? a. Yes, because it focuses on the design of the ar ch. b. Yes, because the writer describes the arch and t ells why it was commissioned. c. No, because the writer does not tell us e nough about the designer of the arch and what he was trying to accomplish. d. No, because the writer does not tell us e nough about St. Louis's role as a gateway to westward expansion. 104 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 Passage IV\u2014Annie Smith Peck Since a hundred years,46 the highest mountains in South America have lured climbers from all over the world. But until 1908, Peru's Mount Huascaran was resisting 47 the efforts of all those who attempted to reach its summit. One mountaineer, Annie Smith Peck, vowed to over - come the obstacles and be the rst to the top of Mt. Huascaran. In order to succeed, she would have to organize expeditions\u2014deal with reluc-tant companions\u2014survive bad weather, and 48 climb steep cliffs of ice and rock. Peck was born in the United States in 1850. Although she didn't start mountain climbing until she was in her thirties, it 49 soon became clear that she had found her life's work. A natural mountaineer, Peck was soon setting records on expeditions on North Amer - ica and Europe. 50 She traveled to Bolivia in 1903 and found Mount Huascaran, which had yet to be surmounted, a challenge she simply could not resist. 51 (1) Peck mounted four expeditions and ma de ve attempts before she nally conquered Mount Huascaran. (2) During free periods amongst52 those expeditions, Peck returned to the United States to raise money. (3) She received help from many scientic organiza-tions, including the Museum of Natural His-tory. (4) The museum had also supported A dmiral Peary on his trip to the North Pole. (5) Still, Peck struggled at least as much to raise money as she did climbing 53 her beloved mountains. In 1908, Peck scraped together the funds f or yet another expedition to Mount Huas- caran. This time, she hired two Swiss guides to assist54 her with the climb. On their rst trip up the mountain's slopes, one of the guides became ill, and the entire team was forced to turn back even though they were very close to the t op.55 Being so close to success was very frustrating for Peck, who could not even prove ho w close they had come because she had acci- dentally brought the wrong kind of lm and was unab le to photograph the climb. The team rested for a few days, the guide recovered, and on August 28, they set off again. The climb was extremely difcult. Steps had to be cut 56 one by one into the steep ice; snow bridges and crevasses had to be carefully crossed. The weather was so cold that everyone suffered from frostbite. When Peck and her two guides were just a short distance from the top, they stopped to determine the exact height of the mountain. At that moment, one of the guides took advantage of Peck's distraction and climbed the few remaining feet to the summit so that he was the rst to reach the peak. What a jerk! 57 Although Peck was understandably angry, she58 focused on the triumph of achiev- ing her goal: standing at last on the top of Mount Huascaran. 46. f. NO CHANGE g.

Bam. Zap!61 Batman triumphs again, foil- ing evildoers like the Joker, Penguin, and Cat-w oman to save the citizens of Gotham City. This superhero created in 1939 and known w orldwide, continues62 to be one of the most popular comic strip characters ever created. Batman was the brainchild of comic book artist Bob Kane. Who was63 just 22 years old when he was asked to create a new superhero for DC Comics. Superman was a phenomenal success, and DC Comics wanted another comic 106 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 book character to appeal to its readers fascina- tions with superheros.64 Kane's idea for Batman reportedly came from Leonardo da Vinci's famous sketch of a man flying with batlike w ings65 and the masked heroes of the Shadow and Zorro series. (1) The masked hero soon moved from c omic books to its own newspaper strip, and in 1943, Batman episodes were aired on the radio. (2) Kane's Batman was a big success66 right from the start. (3) The series was wildly popu- lar and the syndicated show67 still airs today on channels such as the Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. (4) In 1966, live-action Batman shows hit the TV screen, giving the ABC net- work the ratings boost it badly needed. Why was Batman so popular? The answer ma y lay68 in the background Kane gave his character. Batman is really Bruce Wayne, a mil-lionaire who witnessed the murder of his par - ents as a child. He vows to avenge their deaths and the bringing of criminals 69 to justice. He does not have any supernatural powers. Instead, he devotes 70 his life to training his body and mind to ght crime and uses his wealth to develop high-tech tools and weapons, like his famous Batmobile, to aid him in his quest. Thus 71 Kane created a superhero who is just as human as the rest of us, one who72 suffered and has dedicated himself to righting wrongs. In Batman, Kane gave us an image of our own superhero potential. 61. a. NO CHANGE b. Pow, bam, zap! c. Pow-bam-zap! d. Pow! Bam! Zap! 62. f.

Read each passage carefully and then select the best possible answer for each question. Passage I\u2014Humanities This passage is taken from the personal memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, 1885-1886. 1 T he Cause of the Great War of the Rebellion 2 against the United States will have to be attrib - 3 u ted to slavery. For some years before the war 4 began it was a trite saying among some politi - 5 cians that \"A state half slave and half free can - 6 not e xist.\" All must become slave or all free, or 7 the state will go down. I took no part myself in 8 any such view of the case at the time, but since 9 the war is over reviewing the whole question, I 10 ha ve come to the conclusion that the saying is 11 quite true. 12 Slavery was an institution that required 13 unusual guarantees for its security wherever it 14 existed; and in a country like ours where the 15 larger portion of it was free territory inhabited 16 by an intelligent and well-to-do population, the 17 people would naturally have but little sympathy 18 with demands upon them for its protection. 19 Hence the people of the South were dependent 20 upon keeping control of the general govern - 21 me nt to secure the perpetuation of their favor - 22 it e restitution. They were enabled to maintain 23 this control long after the States where slavery 24 existed had ceased to have the controlling 25 power, through the assistance they received 26 from odd men here and there throughout the 27 Northern States. They saw their power waning, 28 and this led them to encroach upon the prerog - 29 at ives and independence of the Northern States 118 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 30 by enacting such laws as the Fugitive Slave Law. 31 By this law every Northern man was obliged, 32 when properly summoned, to turn out and 33 help apprehend the runaway slave of a South- 34 ern man. Northern marshals became slave- 35 catchers, and Northern courts had to 36 contribute to the support and protection of the 37 institution. 38 This was a degradation which the North 39 would not permit any longer than until they 40 could get the power to expunge such laws from 41 the statute books. Prior to the time of these 42 encroachments the great majority of the people 43 of the North had no particular quarrel with 44 slavery, so long as they were not forced to have 45 it themselves. But they were not willing to play 46 the role of police for the South in the protec- 47 tion of this particular institution. In the early 48 days of the country, before we had railroads, 49 telegraphs, and steamboats\u2014in a word, rapid 50 transit of any sort\u2014the States were each almost 51 a separate nationality. At that time the subject 52 of slavery caused but little or no disturbance to 53 the public mind. But the country grew, rapid 54 transit was established, and trade and com-55 merce between the States got to be so much 56 greater than before, that the power of the 57 National government became more felt and 58 recognized and, therefore, had to be enlisted in 59 the cause of this institution. 60 It is probably well that we had the war 61 when we did. We are better off now than we 62 would have been without it, and have made 63 more rapid progress than we otherwise should 64 have made. The civilized nations of Europe 65 have been stimulated into unusual activity, so 66 that commerce, trade, travel, and thorough 67 acquaintance among people of different nation- 68 alities, has become common; whereas, before, it 69 was but the few who had ever had the privilege 70 of going beyond the limits of their own country 71 or who knew anything about other people. 72 T hen, too, our republican institutions were 73 regarded as experiments up to the breaking out 74 of the rebellion, and monarchical Europe gen- 75 e rally believed that our republic was a rope of 76 sand that would part the moment the slightest 77 strain was brought upon it. Now it has shown 78 itself capable of dealing with one of the greatest 79 wars that was ever made, and our people have 80 proven themselves to be the most formidable in 81 war of any nationality. 82 But this war was a fearful lesson, and 83 should teach us the necessity of avoiding wars 84 in the future. The conduct of some of the Euro- 85 p ean states during our troubles shows the lack 86 of conscience of communities where the 87 responsibility does not come upon a single 88 individual. Seeing a nation that extended from 89 ocean to ocean, embracing the better part of a 90 continent, growing as we were growing in pop- 91 ulat ion, wealth and intelligence, the European 92 nations thought it would be well to give us a 93 check. We might, possibly, after a while, 94 threaten their peace, or, at least, the perpetuity 95 of their institutions. Hence, England was con- 96 stantl y nding fault with the administration at 97 Washington because we were not able to keep 98 up an effective blockade. She also joined, at 99 rst, with France and Spain in setting up an 100 Austrian prince upon the throne in Mexico, 101 totally disregarding any rights or claims that 102 Mexico had of being treated as an independent 103 power. It is true they trumped up grievances as 104 a pretext, but they were only pretexts which can 105 always be found when wanted. 119 - - I II I II IACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 1.

Passage II\u2014Natural Sciences Asthma 1 N o longer is asthma considered a condition 2 with isolated, acute episodes of bronchospasm. 3 Rather, asthma is now understood to be a 4 chronic inflammatory disorder of the air - 5 wa ys\u2014that is, inflammation makes the airways 6 chronically sensitive. When these hyperrespon - 7 si ve airways are irritated, airflow is limited, and 8 attacks of coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, 9 and breathing difculty occur. 10 Asthma involves complex interactions 11 among inflammatory cells, mediators, and the 12 cells and tissues in the airways. The interactions 13 result in airflow limitation from acute broncho - 14 c onstriction, swelling of the airway wall, 15 increased mucus secretion, and airway remod - 16 e ling. The inflammation also causes an increase 17 in airway responsiveness. During an asthma 18 attack, the patient attempts to compensate by 19 breathing at a higher lung volume in order to 20 keep the air flowing through the constricted 21 airways, and the greater the airway limitation, 22 the higher the lung volume must be to keep air - 23 wa ys open. The morphologic changes that 24 occur in asthma include bronchial inltration 25 by inflammatory cells. Key effector cells in the 26 inflammatory response are the mast cells, T 27 lymphocytes, and eosinophils. Mast cells and 28 eosinophils are also signicant participants in 29 allergic responses, hence the similarities 30 between allergic reactions and asthma attacks. 31 Other changes include mucus plugging of the 32 airways, interstitial edema, and microvascular 33 leakage. Destruction of bronchial epithelium 34 and thic kening of the subbasement membrane 35 are also characteristic. In addition, there may be 36 hypertrophy and hyperplasia of airway smooth 37 muscle, increase in goblet cell number, and 38 enlargement of submucous glands. 39 Although causes of the initial tendency 40 toward inflammation in the airways of patients 41 with asthma are not yet certain, to date the 42 strongest identied risk factor is atopy. This 43 inherited familial tendency to have allergic 44 reactions includes increased sensitivity to aller - 45 g ens that are risk factors for developing asthma. 46 Some of these allergens include domestic dust 47 mites, animals with fur, cockroaches, pollens, 48 and molds. Additionally, asthma may be trig - 49 g ered by viral respiratory infections, especially 50 in children. By avoiding these allergens and 51 triggers, a person with asthma lowers his or her 52 risk of irritating sensitive airways. A few avoid - 53 anc e techniques include: keeping the home 54 clean and well ventilated, using an air condi - 55 t ioner in the summer months when pollen and 56 mold counts are high, and getting an annual 57 influenza vaccination. Of course, asthma suffer - 58 e rs should avoid tobacco smoke altogether. 59 Cigar, cigarette, or pipe smoke is a trigger 60 whether the patient smokes or inhales the 61 smoke from others. Smoke increases the risk of 62 allergic sensitization in children, increases the 63 severity of symptoms, and may be fatal in chil - 64 dr en who already have asthma. Many of the risk 65 factors for developing asthma may also provoke 66 asthma attacks, and people with asthma may 67 have one or more triggers, which vary from 68 individual to individual. The risk can be further 69 reduced by taking medications that decrease 70 airway inflammation. Most exacerbations can 71 be prevented by the combination of avoiding 72 triggers and taking anti-inflammatory medica - 73 t ions. An exception is physical activity, which is 74 a common trigger of exacerbations in asthma 75 patients. However, asthma patients should not 121 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 76 necessarily avoid all physical exertion, because 77 some types of activity have been proven to 78 reduce symptoms. Rather, they should work in 79 conjunction with a doctor to design a proper 80 training regimen, which includes the use of 81 medication. 82 In order to diagnose asthma, a healthcare 83 professional must appreciate the underlying 84 disorder that leads to asthma symptoms and 85 understand how to recognize the condition 86 through information gathered from the 87 patient's history, physical examination, mea- 88 surements of lung function, and allergic status. 89 Because asthma symptoms vary throughout the 90 day, the respiratory system may appear normal 91 during physical examination. Clinical signs are 92 more likely to be present when a patient is 93 experiencing symptoms; however, the absence 94 of symptoms upon examination does not 95 exclude the diagnosis of asthma. 11. According to the passage, what is the name for the familial inc lination to have hypersensitivity to certain allergens? edema b. hyperplasia c. hype rtrophy d. atopy 12. Why does a person suffering from an asthma atta ck attempt to inhale more air? f. to prevent the loss of consciousness g. to keep air flowing through shrunken air passag eways h. to prevent hyperplasia j. to compensate for weakened mast cells, T l ymphocytes, and eosinophils 13.

She was one of those pretty, charming women w ho are born, as if by an error of Fate, into a petty ofcial's family. She had no dowry, no hopes, nor the slightest chance of being loved and married by a rich man\u2014so she slipped into marriage with a minor civil servant. Unable to afford jewels, she dressed sim- ply: But she was wretched, for women have nei-ther caste nor breeding\u2014in them beauty, grace, and c harm replace pride of birth. Innate rene- ment, instinctive elegance, and wit give them the ir place on the only scale that counts, and these make humble girls the peers of the grand-est ladies. She suffered, feeling that every luxury should r ightly have been hers. The poverty of her rooms\u2014the shabby walls, the worn furni-ture, the ugly upholstery caused her pain. All these thing s that another woman of her class would not even have noticed, made her angry. The very sight of the little Breton girl who cleaned for her awoke rueful thoughts and the wildest dreams in her mind. She dreamt of rooms with Oriental hangings, lighted by tall, bronze torches, and with two huge footmen in knee breeches made drowsy by the heat from the stove, asleep in the wide armchairs. She dreamt of great drawing rooms upholstered in old silks, with fragile little tables holding price- less knickknacks, and of enchanting little sitting r ooms designed for tea-time chats with famous, sought-after men whose attentions all women longed for. She sat down to dinner at her round table with its three-day-old cloth, and watched her husband lift the lid of the soup tureen and delightedly exclaim: \"Ah, a good homemade beef stew! There's nothing better!\" She 123 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 visualized elegant dinners with gleaming silver and gorgeous china. She yearned for wall hang-ings peopled with knights and ladies and exotic b irds in a fairy forest. She dreamt of eating the pink flesh of trout or the wings of grouse. She had no proper wardrobe, no jewels, nothing. And those were the only things that she loved\u2014 she felt she was made for them. She would have so loved to charm, to be envied, to be admired and sought after. She had a rich friend, an old school friend whom she refused to visit, because she suffered so keenly when she returned home. She would weep whole days, with grief, regret, despair, and misery. 21. Which word best describes the actual living c onditions of the couple in the selection? a. destitute b. poor c. comfortable d. wealthy 22.

Passage IV\u2014Social Sciences The Great Depression The worst and longest economic crisis in the modern industrial world, the Great Depression in the United States had devastating conse- quences for American society. At its lowest d epth (1932-1933), more than 16 million people were unemployed, more than 5,000 banks had closed, and over 85,000 businesses had failed. Millions of Americans lost their jobs, their savings, and even their homes. The homeless built shacks for temporary shelter\u2014 these e merging shantytowns were nicknamed Hoovervilles, a bitter homage to President Her - bert Hoover, who refused to give government assistanc e to the jobless. The effects of the Depression\u2014severe unemployment rates and a sharp drop in the production and sales of goods\u2014could also be felt abroad, where many European nations still struggled to recover from World War I. Although the stock market crash of 1929 mar ked the onset of the Depression, it was not the cause of it: deep, underlying ssures already existed in the economy of the Roaring Twenties. For example, the tariff and war-debt policies after World War I contributed to the instability of the banking system. American banks made loans to European countries following World War I. However, the United States kept high tariffs on goods imported from other nations. These policies worked against one another. If other countries could not sell goods in the United States, they could not make enough money to pay back their loans or to buy Ameri-can goods. Moreover, while the United States seemed t o be enjoying a prosperous period in the 1920s, the wealth was not evenly distributed. Businesses made gains in productivity, but only one segment of the population\u2014the wealthy\u2014 reaped large prots. Workers received only a small share of the wealth they helped produce. At the same time, Americans spent more than they earned. Advertising encouraged Americans to buy cars, radios, and household appliances instead of saving or purchasing only what they could afford. Easy credit policies allowed con-sumers to borrow money and accumulate debt. I nvestors also wildly speculated on the stock market, often borrowing money on credit to buy shares of a company. Stocks increased beyond their worth, but investors were willing 125 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 to pay inflated prices because they believed stocks would continue to rise. This bubble burst in the fall of 1929, when investors lost condence that stock prices would keep rising. As investors sold off stocks, the market spiraled downward. The stock market crash affected the economy in the same way that a stressful event can affect the human body, lowering its resis- tance to infection. The ensuing Depression led to the elec- tion of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Roosevelt introduced relief measures that would revive the economy and bring needed relief to Americans suffering the effects of the Depression. In his rst 100 days in ofce, Roos- evelt and Congress passed major legislation that saved banks from closing and regained public condence. These measures, called the New Deal, included the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which paid farmers to slow their production in order to stabilize food prices; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insured bank deposits if banks failed; and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulated the stock market. Although the New Deal offered relief, it did not end the Depression. The economy sagged until the nation entered World War II. However, the New Deal changed the relationship between government and American citizens, by expanding the role of the central government in regulating the economy and creating social assistance programs. 31. The author's main point about the Great D epression is that a. government policies had nothing to do with it. b. the government immediately stepped in with assistanc e for the jobless and homeless. c. underlying problems in the economy p receded it. d. the New Deal policies introduced by F ranklin D. Roosevelt ended it. 32. This passage is best described as f. an account of the causes and effects of a majo r event. g. a statement supporting the value of federal so cial policies. h. a condemnation of outdated beliefs. j. a polite response to controversial issues. 33. The author cites the emergence of Hoovervilles in par agraph 1 as an example of a. federally sponsored housing programs. b. the resilience of Americans who lost their jo bs, savings, and homes. c. the government's unwillingness to assist cit izens in desperate circumstances. d. the effectiveness of the Hoover a dministration in dealing with the crisis. 34. All of the following are cited as causes of the d epression EXCEPT f. overspending by consumers. g. rampant inflation. h. post-World War I European debt. j. investor overspeculation in the stock market. 35.

It can be inferred from the passage that over - production by farmers f. stabilizes food prices. g. causes food to go to waste. h. destabilizes food prices. j. helps the economy in general. 39. The content in the last paragraph of the passage w ould most likely support which of the follow- ing statements? a. The New Deal policies were not radical e nough in challenging capitalism. b. The economic policies of the New Deal b rought about a complete business recovery. c. The Agricultural Adjustment Act paid far mers to produce surpluses. d. The federal government became more in volved in caring for needy members of society. 40.

Passage I\u2014Data Representation Sound is transmitted through the air in wave pat-terns. The human ear can hear sound waves between ab out 15 and 20,000 cycles per second (cps). Most music and other common sounds occur in the range of 32 to 4,096 Hz. High-frequency, short-wavelength sound waves are heard as high pitched and low-frequency, long-wavelength sound waves are heard as low pitched. Like other wave phenomena, sounds have a q uality of harmonic dissonance or consonance. We experience these two types of sound mixtures as being different to our senses, but they also have important physical properties quite apart from human feelings about them. All materials vibrate to some extent. Both natural and articial dissonances and consonances in both natural and articial struc- tures are very important phenomena. Figure 1 is an image of ve different sound wave patt erns that demonstrate the principle of dissonance and consonance. Tones a, b, and d are each single tones. Tones c and e are formed by sounding a with b and sounding a with d. 127 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 Tone a: A Single Musical To ne time Tone d: A To ne the Frequency of Tone a Tone e: To ne a Played with Tone d Tone b: A To ne the Frequency of Tone a Tone c: Tone a Played with Tone b 1 4 7 8 Figure 1 The frequencies of a and b are not divisible by each other or by any small multiple of each other, and they combine to form a bumpy combined tone, sound c. Sound d is one-quarter the frequency of a. Sound e is a combination of a and d. This is a highly consonant combination of tones. Other simple ratios of frequencies such as 2:3, 3:4, and 4:5 also form consonances. The amplitude of each sound is the air pressure p roduced by the wave. Its fluctuations are indicated by the peaks and valleys of the graph lines. Although sound is generally not highly destructive, sounds can reach amplitudes that not only can damage sensitive hearing organs but can bring bridges and other struc-tures crashing down. 1. Dissonances made by combining two tones c lose to each other in frequency produce what are called beats. The beats are alternating loud and soft percussive sounds created from two sounds of relatively constant volume. The num- ber of beats produced each second equals the diff erence between the frequencies in cycles per second of the two tones. Assuming that tone a's frequency is 8 cps, what is the clearest evidence of beats in Figure 1? a. Tone d has a regular pattern of rising and fal ling amplitude. b. Tone c's amplitude has a high point and a lo w point every eighth cycle of sound a. c. Tone e has an obvious beat every fourth cy cle. d. Tone c and e each have beats but at different fr equencies because the tones that compose them have different frequencies. 128 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 2. The musical interval called an octave occurs b etween two tones whose sounds seem to blend into each other's because the higher-pitched one has precisely twice the frequency of the other. Each successively higher octave is twice the frequency of the next lower one. Are any of the tones shown in Figure 1 in an octave rela-tionship with another tone? f. No. g. Yes; 7 \u00d7 8 is 56, so the third octave above t one b will be seven octaves above tone a. h. Yes; tone e is two octaves above tone a. j. Yes; tone a is two octaves above tone e. 3. When two tones are played together, the abso- lute values of their amplitudes are added t ogether when they both have the same sign. One is subtracted from the other when they have different signs. The single tones a, b, and d each vary in amplitude from +1 to 1. What is the maximum absolute amplitude that can be reached by the mixed tones? Note: These graphs are not necessarily all drawn to the same verti- cal scale. a. 2 for both c and e b. 2 for e. Tone c cannot be determined because its tw o frequencies are not equally divisible. c. 2 f or e and 187 for c d. There is no maximum. The amplitude keeps b uilding as the sound continues. 4. Throughout history, humans have known that so me materials will dampen the transmission of sound and others will enhance it. Effective soundproong by using sound insulation has always required bulky materials. However, high-speed, modern sound-sensing and pro-duction devices have made it possible to cancel ou t sound with devices weighing only a few grams. This is based on the principle of sound interference: vibrations in opposite directions cancel each other out. Examine Figure 1 in light of this and explain how this is possible. f. Consonant sounds blend together, so a soft c onsonance will dampen a loud one. g. Dissonances interfere with each other. If a s ufcient array of dissonant sounds is played against a tone, it will drown it out. h. Positive and negative vibrations tend to canc el each other out. Noise-canceling devices depend on detecting noise and then creating a noise with a pattern of vibration exactly opposite the one to be canceled. j. Sound levels are relative. Bursts of very loud t ones that last only a few thousandths of a second are not noticed by a listener, but they dull the ability to hear softer noise. 129 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 5. All structures have resonant characteristics. T his means they will vibrate at certain frequen- cies. Musical instruments, including the various e lements composing human vocal capabilities, are designed to maximize their resonant capa-bilities. Based on Figure 1, the discussion in q uestion 3, and elsewhere, which of the follow- ing are reasons why engineers are careful to a void strongly resonant structures? a. It is preferable that engineering structures be q uiet. b. Consistent vibrations can gradually fatigue mat erials and lead to early structural failure. c. The magnitudes of consonant sound waves a dd up. Disturbances, including sounds consonant with the resonant frequency of a structure, can cause a rapid increase in the energy of a structure's vibration and lead to catastrophic failure. d. all of the above Passage II\u2014Conflicting Viewpoints The paradoxical nature of the speed of light and all electromagnetic radiation is one of the great histori-cal issues of science. Figure 1 illustrates the problem. A scientist with a powerful searchlight and a radar speed gun is standing on the side of a perfectly straight highway in Kansas. The searchlight and the speed gun are both pointed straight along the high- way. A sports car drives by and the scientist measures its speed at 120 km/hr. Then a maglev train whizzes by on the central median at 480 km/hr. From the maglev, a passenger with a radar gun conrms that the train is moving away from the scientist at 480 km/ hr and away from the sports car at 360 km/hr. The passenger in the sports car measures the speed of the receding scientist at 120 km/hr and the speed of the maglev, receding in the opposite direction, at 360 km/hr. Fr om scientist, 480 km/hr 360 km/hr From scientist: km/hr 1,079,252,849 sports sports carand maglev Figure 1 130 \u0000 \u0000- - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 The scientist and the passengers in the maglev of the speed measurements. What are called material and the sports car also have equipment to measure objects all have speeds relative to each other, but elec- the speed of the searchlight beam traveling along the tromagnetic radiation has the same speed relative to highway. All three measure the beam's speed at all. Two young scientists attempt to explain this. 1,079,252,849 km/hr.

This is called time dilation. H e suggests that there could be identical clocks on the maglev, in the sports car, and with the scientist, which the scientist could read. If a second measured on the sports car took longer than the scientist's sec- ond, and if one on the maglev took even longer, then lig ht, traveling past all three, would be measured at the same speed as it moved past all three, even though the speeds of each differ relative to the others. Al's hypothesis and his method for calculating the exact quantity of time dilation from the speed of separation of two objects is illustrated in Figure 2. The clock consists of two mirrors parallel to each other, a beam of light that bounces back and forth b etween them, and a device that measures how long each round trip of the light takes. When the clock is stationary relative to the observer, the distance the light travels is 2 \u00d7 the perpendicular distance between the mirrors (2ls). When the clock is moving, the observer sees the light moving along a zigzag path because the mirrors keep moving forward as the light bounces back and forth (2lm). The zigzag path is lon- ger than the vertical path, so the clock appears to have lo nger seconds. An observer traveling with the clock, however, will see only the vertical up-and-down motion, and the seconds of the clock will be just like any other clock that appears stationary. Speed-of-Light Clock Light beam T = Clock at rest Clock moving relative to observer relative to observer Mirrors ls lm 2lm cT =2ls t Motion of clock Figure 2 131 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 The formula derived from this model for the factor of difference in time is T = 1 \u00f7 2 .\u0012 v 12 c T is the ratio of increase in time on the appar - ently moving clock compared to the apparently sta- tionary one. The speed at which the clocks are moving a way from each other is v, and c is the speed of light. Explanation 2 Al's friend, Alby, explains that the phenomenon could also be accounted for if the length of an object mov- ing away from another contracted relative to its le ngth when stationary. If the length of an object contracts as it approaches the speed of light, the speed o f light will appear to remain the same relative to it. This theory of relativistic length is illustrated in Figur e 3. The length of each object contracts in the direction it is moving away from the other, as the speed of separation increases. At low speeds, such as those we see, this contraction is not even measurable with highly precise instrumentation. As the speed of light is reached, the lengths of the objects shrink to zero. Figure 3 Relativistic Length Contraction as a Space Probe Reaches the Speed of Light 132 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 6. Lo ok at the formula for time dilation provided by Al. According to this formula, what will be the factor of time dilation between two objects mov-ing away from each other at the speed of light? f. innite or undened g. zero h. one j. the square root of 1 7. Look at Figure 2, Table 1, and Al's theory of t ime dilation. Which of these answers best describes the phenomenon of time dilation rel-ative to an observer A and an observer B, mov-ing away from each other at a large fraction of the sp eed of light? a. B's time slows down as observed from A, and A 's time speeds up as observed from B. b. A's time is unchanged, but B's time slows d own. c. B's time slows down as observed from A, and A 's time slows down as observed from B. d. B's time speeds up as observed from A, and A 's time speeds up as observed from B. 8. Look again at Al's time dilation formula. Which answ er best describes time dilation as the velocity of separation goes from 0 to the speed of light? f. Time dilation is inversely proportional to the v elocity of separation. g. Time dilation is proportional to the velocity o f separation. h. Time dilation is proportional to the inverse sq uare of the velocity of separation. j. Time dilation is inversely proportional to the sq uare root of 1 minus the square of the velocity of separation divided by the speed of light. 9. Redshift occurs in the radiation emitted from far distant ast ronomical bodies moving rapidly away from our solar system. Electromagnetic patterns emitted by these bodies are shifted from their usual place in the spectrum toward the red, low-frequency end of the spectrum. Which statement about this phenomenon is consistent with the theory of time dilation pre- sented here? a. Interstellar matter lters out higher- fr equency emissions. This allows the lower ones to reach Earth. b. Redshift is associated with lower frequencies, w hich means the wave cycles of the electromagnetic radiation reaching us from these objects are slower than those from nearby objects emitting the same type of radiation. This is consistent with time dilation theory. c. Redshift is unrelated to time dilation. d. Redshift tends to disprove time dilation. If t ime slowed down on distant bodies moving away from us, then higher, not lower, frequencies would reach us. 10. Examine Al's formula again. If two objects are stat ionary relative to each other, what will the time dilation factor be? f. innite or undened g. zero h. inversely proportional to the square of their distance from each other j. 1 133 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 11. Consider Al's and Alby's hypotheses together. It is g enerally accepted among scientists that both time dilation and relativistic length contraction occur. In view of what has been presented here, describe what this would mean for an object as it reaches the speed of light. a. Nothing. These changes are perceived by a distantl y receding observer, but from the standpoint of the moving object, the speed cannot be detected. b. Time would virtually stop and length would b e contracted to nearly zero. c. Whatever happened to the object speeding a way would also happen to the observer. d. Answers a, b , and c are each consistent with the theory presented here. 12. Consider Figure 2 and Al's time dilation for - mula, which is derived from it. How would the f ormula or its results be different if the objects were moving toward each other? f. The formula would remain the same, but the v elocity of separation would be negative instead of positive, so time would speed up for each object relative to the other. g. T he formula would be changed from vT = 1 \u00f7 1 \u00122 to T = 1 \u00f7 \u0010 v 2 . This 2 1 c 2 c would then show that time would speed up for each object relative to the other. h. According to the formula, it makes no diff erence whether the velocity between the objects is negative or positive because v 2 = (v)2. This is consistent with the rationale given for the formula because, whether the objects are moving toward each other or away from each other, the same zigzag motion will be observed in each from the other. j. none of the above 134 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 Passage III\u2014Research Summary perpetuate their genetic structure by replicating Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl conducted an themselves, but it was not known how this was done. experimental series to demonstrate the mechanism Three hypotheses, as illustrated in Figure 1, were for DNA replication.

Conservative: The entire double helix remains inta ct as it replicates itself from available material. 2. Semiconservative: T he two DNA strands unravel and each then creates a new second strand for itself out of new materials. 3. Dispersive: T he original DNA strand breaks into pieces and replicates itself piece by piece. Each piece replicates itself from new material. Experiment 1 Two batches of E. coli bacteria are cultured using only ammonia as the source for nitrogen. One batch uses only 14N and the other only 15N. After several replica- tion cycles, the DNA from both batches is mixed in e qual proportions and then centrifuged. As intended, the DNA separates into two distinct areas, heavy and light. Their location in the centrifuged test tube is noted. The next piece of old DNA attaches itself to the Experiment 2new DNA and replicates a new piece, which gets E. coli ba cteria are cultured in a medium rich in 15N,attached to the end of the last old piece, until an which is heavier than the normal nitrogen isotope, entire DNA molecule is replicated. 14N. After enough time passes to develop a signicant 135 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 proportion of the DNA to be composed using only 15N, the mixture is centrifuged to separate out the heavy DNA. Experiment 3 The heavy DNA is introduced into a 14N medium and allowed to replicate. All new DNA elements will be composed only of 14N. Based on the known E. coli rate of reproduction and other observations, it is determined when the DNA in the culture has been fully replicated. At the completion of each full repli-cation, a sample is taken and centrifuged to deter - mine the ratio of different weights of DNA. Table 1 is a simplied report of the results. It s hows that quantities of heavy, light, and intermediate (having a weight close to midway between heavy and light) DNA are found. No DNA of other weights is found. Replication 0 is the composition when the rst heavy DNA culture is introduced. Replications 1, 2, and 3 are the subsequent generations of replication.

What is the most reasonable explanation of the pur pose of experiment 1? a. To prove that E. coli bacteria do not change the nit rogen from one isotope to another. b. To make sure the E. coli bacteria is not c ontagious. c. To demonstrate that the centrifuge ap paratus successfully separates out the DNA by weight, and to be able to recognize which weight is which. d. To prove that the DNA is always half heavy and half light. 14. After one replication cycle, what would be the e xpected proportion of DNA weights if the conservative replication model were followed? f. Half the DNA would be heavy and half w ould be light because the conservative model preserves the original DNA, which is all heavy, and produces new DNA using the nitrogen in the medium, which is all light. g. There would be random distribution b etween heavy and light because natural reproduction is random. h. All the DNA would be light because all new DN A produced would have to be light. j. All the DNA would be heavy because it is all p roduced by heavy DNA. 136 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 15. If there were random weights of DNA between hea vy and light, which replication hypothesis would be correct? a. None of them would be correct. b. Any of them would be correct because over t ime the different weights will gradually mix and average out. c. The dispersive method would be correct b ecause under the conservative method the original heavy DNA would remain heavy, and all new DNA would be light. Under the semiconservative method all DNA would have either two heavy strands, two light strands, or one of each. d. The dispersive method or the se miconservative method would be correct because each of them mixes light with heavy DNA. 16. Based on the results of replication 1 reported in T able 1 only, which replication methods were ruled out and which remained as possibly cor - rect, pending additional trials? f. None were ruled out. g. The conservative and dispersive methods w ere ruled out\u2014the conservative because the original heavy DNA was eliminated, and the dispersive because it results in a random distribution of weights. h. The dispersive method was ruled out b ecause the results were not random. j. The conservative method was ruled out b ecause the original heavy DNA is no longer there. The other two remain possible because they both involve replicating new DNA half out of the old DNA and half out of the new light nitrogen. 17. At which replication trial was it proven which r eplication method is really used? a. Replication 2. Replication 1 ruled out the c onservative method. With the semiconservative method, each DNA molecule would have one strand of heavy and one of light after replication 1. Each of these strands would then create a second strand for itself using light nitrogen. The result would be 50% intermediate and 50% light as shown in Table 1 for replication 2. The dispersive method would have produced a more random mixture of weights. b. It is still not clear. c. Replication 3. Replication 2 made it look like the se miconservative method, but replication 3 provided the extra insurance needed. d. Replication 1. Only the semiconservative me thod could produce all intermediate- weight DNA. 18. What is likely to happen during succeeding rep-lication cycles? f. The heavy DNA would die off and disappear. g. A point of balance would be reached and maintaine d between light and intermediate DNA. h. There is no way to predict. j. Each replication cycle would halve the p ercentage of intermediate DNA and increase the amount of light DNA by a corresponding amount. Passage IV\u2014Research Summary A series of experiments conducted at the close of the nineteenth and the dawn of the twentieth century concluded that electricity consists of particles, rather than a continuous fluid; accurately determined the quantity of a single unit of electrical charge; and accurately determined the mass of an electron. 137 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 Previously, electrical charge had been thought to be a continuous fluid, and the proton, thousands of times larger than the newly discovered electron, had been considered the smallest building block of matter. Experiment 1 Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Figure 1 Figure 1 illustrates a simple cathode ray tube (CRT). Applying an electrical voltage to these par - tially evacuated tubes creates a visible brilliant ray and causes the interior and the glass surface of the tube to shimmer and glow with light. Applying a magnetic eld causes the ray to change directions. In the experiments, the rays responded to magnetic elds as a negatively charged substance would be expected to do, but with two differences: the calcu-lated ratio of mass to charge was thousands of times smal ler than what had been calculated for positively charged matter, and, unlike positively charged matter, the rays did not respond to electrical elds. Experiment 2 It was discovered that if the strength of the vacuum in a CRT is increased sufciently, the cathode ray does respond to electrical as well as magnetic elds. The meas ured magnitudes involved suggest that cathode rays are composed of negatively charged matter whose ratio of mass to charge is a tiny fraction of the mass of previously known positively charged particles. Experiment 3 Next, the properties of the hypothesized discovered par ticles were determined. Figure 2 illustrates the apparatus used. It has two chambers. A mist of oil is sprayed into the top chamber, and is examined and measured with the aid of a microscope in the lower chamber. There are two steps: 1. A ne spray of electrically charged oil falls from the up per chamber through the lower. When a droplet stops accelerating downward, the gravi-tational force acting on it is balanced by the v iscosity and flotation force of the air. From the known density of the oil and viscosity of the air, its mass and the magnitude of the forces keeping it in balance are computed. 2. A known voltage of electricity is applied to the plat es in the lower chamber. The size of the electrical charge on the oil droplet is computed from the strength of the electrical eld required to stop the downward motion of the known mass of oil. Several thousand Voltas Cover Microscope C Uniform electric field Oil spray Figure 2 138 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 The charge, in coulombs (C), was calculated for many oil droplets. Table 1 illustrates the nature of the results obtained.

Results in a pattern such as that in Table 1 sup-port the idea that electrical charges are carried b y particles, each carrying the same charge. What feature of the results indicates this? a. They proceed in order from lower numbers t o higher numbers. b. The lowest number reported is 477 and the hig hest equals 20 \u00d7 477. c. All of the results are equally divisible by 159. d. Number 20's charge is slightly more than o ne half of number 40's, so the rate of increase declines. 139 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 20. After experiment 3 determined that negatively c harged substances are all composed of specic quantities of single particles, each of which car - ries the same charge, which of these statements e xplains how the mass of each particle can be calculated? f. The mass of each oil droplet was calculated. D ividing that by the number of charged particles will give the mass per particle. g. The report on experiment 1 states that the r atio of mass to electrical charge (m/e) was already known. Multiplying that ratio by the electrical charge (e) of each particle gives the mass. h. The mass of a hydrogen atom, consisting of o ne proton and one electron, is known. Dividing that by 2 gives you the mass of one electron. j. Add up all of the electrical charge values in T able 1 and divide by 40. 21. Look again at the accounts of experiment 1 and e xperiment 2. How did experiment 2 correct the ndings of experiment 1? a. In experiment 2, the CRTs do not glow b ecause the vacuum is too strong. b. In experiment 2, it was discovered that the catho de rays are negatively charged. c. In experiment 2, it was discovered that catho de rays respond to magnetic elds. d. The results of experiment 1 seemed to show that catho de rays were not influenced by electrical elds, but experiment 2 demonstrated that if the tubes had a strong enough vacuum, the rays did respond. 22. In experiment 3, why are the oil droplets per - mitted to float down through the lower cham- ber before the electrical eld is activated? f. To establish the mass and the magnitude of the no nelectrical forces acting on the droplet. g. To conserve electricity. h. To build up momentum against which the e lectrical forces will work. j. To verify that the droplets are actually ne gatively charged. 23. Consider the state of understanding as of e xperiment 1 and the conclusions of experi- ment 3. What was demonstrated by the experi-ment 3 results reported in Table 1 that was not sho wn by experiment 1? a. Negatively charged substances have a very smal l mass. b. Both negatively and positively charged s ubstances respond to magnetic elds. c. Both negatively and positively charged s ubstances respond to electrical elds. d. Negative charge exists only in units of 1.59 \u00d7 10 19 C, and the mass for each unit of charge is thousands of times smaller than previously known particles. 24. One of the scientists involved in this work c laims that the newly discovered minuscule particles are the building blocks out of which all larger particles are formed. What aspects of the experimental results support that conclusion? f. Larger particles cannot combine to produce smal ler ones. g. The new particles respond to both electrical and mag netic elds. h. Two negatives make a positive, but two p ositives do not make a negative. j. There is no support in the data for that the ory. 140 \u0000\u0000 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 Passage V\u2014Data Representation The conical pendulum is a pendulum that is anchored at some height and swings around in a circle rather than swinging back and forth like a standard pendu-lum. Its chain traces out a cone as the bob circles b elow the anchor, as shown in Figure 1. Conical Pendulum Figure 1 The forces acting on a conical pendulum with constant angular velocity are gravity, g, and the ten- sion on the chain, T . The chain tension has a vertical component that counteracts gravity and a horizontal component, known as the centripetal force, that pulls the pendulum bob toward the center of the circle, forcing it to follow a circular path. These forces are diagrammed in Figure 2. H R A c mg TL Legend V angle the chain makes with the vertical L length of the chain T tension on the chain H vertical height from the orbit of the pendulum to the anchor FC, AC centripetal force, centripetal acceleration R radius of the pendulum's path \u0003\\ angular velocity of the pendulum bob m mass of the pendulum bob g force of gravity on the pendulum bob Figure 2 Vector analysis of these forces using the trigonomet- ric relations R = sin(V)L and H = cos(V)L indicates that T 2 2= FC 2 + g2mVFC = T sin(V) = R g = T cos(V) where V = tangential velocity. If the mass of the chain is negligible compared to the mass of the pendulum bob, the relationships between velocity, radius, and chain length are always the same, regardless of mass. 141 \u0000- - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 Here are formulas for acceleration and velocity that ignore mass: 2 2 + A 2= AC AT g AC = AT sin(V) = V 2 R A = AT cos(V)g V = tan 6RAg where A = acceleration and the subscripts T, C, and g are the acceleration due to tension on the chain, cen- tripetal force, and gravity, respectively. V is the tan- gential velocity, and R is the radius. Physically, this means that the pendulum bob is mo ving with a certain velocity. The force that keeps it from following a straight-line path or falling due to gravity is the tension of the chain (T). T pul ls the pendulum bob up to counteract gravity and toward the center of the circle to alter its straight-line path. The relationship between the vertical and horizontal forces of T is that as the chain becomes more hori- zontal the centripetal force increases in comparison t o gravity. This can happen only if the velocity increases, as shown in the formulas. A tetherball apparatus functions like a conical pendulum. As the ball moves faster, it also rises higher. When it slows down, it descends. Table 1 and Figure 3 show how the velocity, r adius, and height change as the angle from the verti- cal (V) of a pendulum 20 meters in length changes fr om 0\u00b0 to 89\u00b0.

Looking at Figures 2 and 3 and Table 1, which gur e best illustrates the position of the pendu- lum bob and chain as V goes from 0\u00b0 to 89\u00b0? a. b. c. d. 26. According to Table 1, what is the relationship between the radius and height at 45\u00b0? f. The radius = UH. g. The radius = 21 the height. h. They are equal. j. The height is 1.7321 \u00d7 the radius. 27. The graphs for radius and height in Figure 3 ap pear to be the same shape except that one is flipped around a vertical line at 45\u00b0. Based on Table 1 and your understanding of how these values are generated, are they the same shape? Why or why not? a. Yes, they are because they both end with the p endulum bob at the end of a 20 m chain. b. No , they are not because the height decreases as the radius increases. c. Yes, they are because they cross at 45\u00b0. d. Yes they are because the radius = 20 m \u00d7 sin( V) and the height = 20 m \u00d7 cos(V). 28. Look at the explanation of the forces affecting the p endulum bob, especially the description for velocity V, the graph line given in Figure 3, and the formula for V. Which statement best describes what must happen to V as the pendu-lum approaches 90 o from the vertical? f. It increases. g. It decreases to nothing. h. It increases at a rapidly accelerating rate. j. Answer h is correct, but no matter how fast the v elocity becomes, the pendulum bob can never be perfectly horizontal because if it were there would be no vertical component of the tension force acting against gravity. 144 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 29. Consider the formula for centripetal force, mVFC = . What happens to the magnitude of R the force required to keep the pendulum on its circular path when the angle from the vertical approaches 90\u00b0? a. It decreases to zero because the height H of the p endulum, which is proportional to the gravitational force, decreases to zero. b. It will be at its minimum point because the r adius R is at its maximum. c. It will accelerate at an accelerating rate with no limit b ecause V, which is the main factor in the formula, is accelerating toward innity. d. It remains the same because H is being c hanged, not V or R. Passage VI\u2014Research Summary Carbon 14 dating is a widely used method for deter - mining the age of formerly living objects. The earth's at mosphere and living things, which derive their car - bon directly or indirectly from the atmosphere, all ha ve virtually the same proportions of the 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 isotopes. These one-trillionth of the carbon in most substances is 14C. The reason 14C is useful as a measure of age is that it is radioactive. It decays at a rate of half of the atoms in a sample every 5,732 years. When a 14C atom changes to 14N, it emits a beta particle. The beta par - ticles can be counted to measure how many 14C atoms exist in a sample being tested. Living organisms regu-late their own composition and are constantly r efreshing the compounds out of which they are composed. As long as they are alive, their carbon iso-tope concentration remains one atom of 14C per tril- lion atoms of carbon. When they die, the 14C begins decaying according to the formula T = 5,732 \u00d7 log2(N/N ), where T is the time since the organism o died, 5,732 is the half-life of 14C, N is the number of 14C atoms now in the sample, and N is the original o number. Figure 1 shows the expected ratio N/N for o organic remains that began decaying over the past 60 centuries. Centuries ago 145 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 Study 1 In the 1940s, Willard F. Libby and others proposed using carbon 14 dating as a means of determining the age of wood, organic remains, and other materials that could be expected to have had the standard one in a trillion 14C atoms when they died. They con- ducted a series of experiments on samples taken from ar tifacts whose age was known from historical records. The results conrmed the usefulness of the method. Study 2 An expedition to an abandoned campre site in the P acic collected a number of artifacts found there. They were sent to a carbon-dating lab, and the beta radiation emissions from samples of the carbon in each artifact were tested to determine the amount of 14C remaining. Table 1 shows the N/N (14C now o present/original 14C level) ratio for a number of arti- facts found at an abandoned campre site in the P acic. TABLE 1 ARTIFACT N/NO wooden bowl 0.987 bone fragment 1 0.931 bone fragment 2 0.928 ivory fragment 0.927 fur 0.999 spear shank 0.500 30. Based on the description of carbon 14 dating in this passage, why are the N/N n umbers in o Table 1 evidence about the age of the artifacts? f. Living organisms all have the same ratio of car bon 14 to total carbon. After they die the carbon 14 decays and the ratio declines. The ratio of carbon 14 remaining to the original amount tells us when the organism began decaying. g. Living organisms all contain carbon. When the y die, the carbon combines with oxygen and forms carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide gas. This gas is dissipated in the atmosphere. h. The carbon becomes radioactive after the o rganism dies. The more radioactive it is, the longer ago it died. j. Carbon is the basis of all organic c ompounds. 31. Which of the artifacts is the oldest? a. fur b. bone fragment 2 c. spear shank d. wo oden bowl 32. Figure 1 does not give a precise indication of the r elationship between years of decay and expected N/N values. Is other information o presented that can give a more precise dating for one of the artifacts listed in Table 1? Which artifact is it, and how old is it? f. No, Figure 1 is the only information a vailable. g. The age of the wooden bowl can be est imated at 10 years. h. The spear shank is 5,732 years old. j. Bone fragment 2 is just a little bit more than 1,800 y ears old. 146 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 33.

Figure 2 shows a condensed view of the calcu- lated N/N v alues going back 75,000 years in o the past. Which statements are supported by this chart and what this passage has reported about the process of radioactive decay? f. After about 21,000 years the concentration of 14C drops below one atom of carbon out of 10 trillion. g. After 50,000 years the concentration of 14C is so diffuse that carbon dating is not at all reliable. h. More than half of the original 14C has decayed after 6,000 years. j. all of the above 35. Based on the description of study 1, when car - bon 14 dating determines the age of an organic o bject, what is the event in the history of that object at which the aging began? a. Its birth for mammals or the equivalent for othe r animals and plants. b. When it was formed into the object found. F or instance, when a branch was cut from a tree and made into a spear. c. When its cells died and began decaying. d. When its carbon molecules were formed. 1 6 1 1 1 6 21 26 31 36 41 46 51 56 61 6 6 7 1 76 Thousands of years Figure 2 147 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 TABLE 1 Passage VII\u2014Data Representation Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are bacteria that swim around carrying crystals of magnetic minerals, including magnetite (Fe 3O4) and greigite (Fe3S4) inside their cell walls. These metallic crystals are called magnetosomes. Most organisms contain only trace amounts of iron (Fe), but MTBs have concen- trations in the range of 3%. This is high enough so that they are affected by magnetic elds. Many MTB species characteristically swim either parallel to or perpendicular to the earth's magnetic eld lines. Since their discovery they have been widely studied as possibly the original source of existing iron ore deposits, as a possible means for concentrating iron now dispersed throughout the earth's lakes and oceans, and for other reasons.

The purpose of the study was to obtain data on the difference that various environments made on the density of the MTBs' magnetosomes. Samples were taken from 29 different areas as described in Table 1. These are divided into three broad regions: the primary iron ore area (samples P1 to P4); the iron cap belt, which is a secondary con- centration of iron ore (samples T1 to T8); and the s urface soil (samples M1 to M17). All of the primary ore samples are taken from iron ore. All of the surface soil samples are taken from soil. Both soil and iron ore samples were taken from the cap belt. On the scatter plot all of the soil samples are marked with outlined symbols and the ore samples with solid sym-bols. The density measure for each sample is the mass in mg o f MTBs found in a standard 10 g sample. Table 2 shows the average MTB density for each o f the four types of samples.

Look at Table 2 and characterize the sample t ypes from the standpoint of MTB density. f. As expected, the primary ore samples are the r ichest in MTBs, followed by the iron cap ore, then the iron cap soil and the surface soil, in that order. g. The primary ore and surface soil samples are ap proximately twice as rich in MTBs as the iron cap samples. h. The surface soil samples appear to be almost as r ich as the primary oil samples, but that is because there were many more samples taken. j. There is no particular distinction between MTB d ensities in the different sample types. The primary ore is the highest, but the iron cap ore is the lowest. The two soil categories are in between. 37. Based on Figure 1, characterize the top ve soil samples in MTB d ensity. a. They are the four primary ore samples plus o ne iron cap ore sample. b. They are all surface soil samples. c. All but one of them are surface soil samples. T he number 2 sample is primary ore and it is approximately half as dense as the leading soil sample. d. Four are surface soil samples and one is iron cap so il. 38. Which statement is most strongly supported by the data p resented in Table 1, Table 2, and Fig- ure 1? f. Environmental concerns are not relevant to the d ensity of MTBs. g. MTB density depends on the density of iron in the e nvironment. h. Darker soil has more MTBs than lighter soil. j. Environment seems to play a role, but it is not base d strictly on density of iron. 39. Some experimenters hypothesize that the MTB r ichness of the surface soil samples may be because the surface soil is richer in moisture and other nutrients than the ore or iron cap soil samples. If that hypothesis is demonstrated, which of these statements would that support? a. MTBs do not require rich iron ore deposits as a sour ce of iron. b.

This answer corrects the sentence fragment. 2. h. This properly places the subject pronoun she immediately after the comma and is the clearest. 3. b. This choice makes the sentence consistent in tense and is more concise than answer choice c. 4. h. This properly sequences the modiers\u2014 normally after walk, w ithout the aid of a crutch or brace after normally, and by age 12 last. 5. a. This is correct as it stands. The who clause is nonessential and should be set off by a comma. 6. f. The sentence is correct as it is, and is more informative than choice j. 7. c. This is the correct word order. 8. g. This is the most correct and concise version. The transition here should not be omitted, as it makes the passage of time easier to fol- low. 9. d. The simple past tense is most appropriate here. 10. j. Choice f is a r un-on, choice g incorrectly uses a semicolon, and choice h incorrectly uses dashes. 11. b. How ever is the most appropriate transition here. 12. h. This answer offers the most precise and vivid word choice. 13. a. This choice best conveys the main idea of the passage. Choice b focuses only on Rudolph's family; choice c understates the physical handicaps she overcame; and choice d does not mention her athletic accomplish- ments. 14. h. The most logical place is after the sentence that lists the three gold medals that Rudolph won. 15. b. This logically separates her accomplishments in track and eld from her accomplishments in ghting segregation. Passage II\u2014Bicycles 16. g. T his answer has the most appropriate and correct usage and word choice. 17. d. T he present perfect tense\u2014have made\u2014is correct. 18. h. T he phrase a Scottish blacksmith is relevant but nonessential information and needs to be set off by commas. 19. a. T his is correct as is. 20. h. T he verb needs to be in the simple past tense. 21. a. T his is correct as is. 22. g. T here should not be a comma between the subject and the verb. 23. d. T his choice gives the sentence parallel structure. 24. j. T he subject\u2014the bicycle\u2014must immediately follow the comma. 25. c. A c omma should go after an introductory word or phrase, and they are correctly replaces there. 26. h. T his choice presents the correct word order. 27. d. T he noun form transportation is correct. 28. g. T his choice gives readers reasons to buy a bicycle for themselves. 29. b. T his is the most logical sequence. The sen- tence about Lawson and naming the safety b icycle correctly comes before the details of the safety bicycle. Sentence 13 is the best conclusion for the paragraph. 30. f. W hile all the answer choices are relevant to the passage, choice f most accurately cap- tures the central theme. 154 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 Passage III\u2014The Gateway Arch 31. b. The colon is the most correct punctuation mark here. Colons introduce explanations. 32. h. This answer has the most appropriate and concise word choice. It could be omitted without ruining the sentence (choice j), but it would take out an idea central to the essay: that the monument is amazing. 33. d. There are no commas needed here. 34. h. Take ag rees with trams, or they take visitors. 35. a. This is the correct helping verb and tense. 36. g. Imposing should be a modier, and using the participial form is the most concise. 37. c. Use who when referring to people as the subject of a sentence. 38. j. This is the most concise and effective version. 39. b. His agrees with Saarinen. 40. g. This is the proper phrasing. 41. d. This is the most concise and effective version. 42. h. The subject, the ar ch, must immediately fol- low the comma. 43. b. This is the most logical choice. The rst paragraph introduces the topic and main idea; the third paragraph then describes the background of the arch and establishes a chronological order; the second paragraph continues the chronology; and the fourth paragraph returns to the idea of the arch's remarkable design, as established in the introduction. 44. f. Saarinen's other work is not pertinent to the St. Louis Arch. 45. d. The passage discusses the design of the monument but does not describe how the city and monument honor St. Louis's role as a gateway to westward expansion. It simply mentions this fact. Passage IV\u2014Annie S mith P eck 46. h. This is the most accurate and concise choice. 47. c. In this instance, the past perfect is the appro-priate tense. 48. g. Separate items in a list with commas, unless one or more items already has a comma (then use a semicolon). 49. a. This is correct as it stands. Choice c would create a sentence fragment. 50. h. The correct preposition is in, and the word continents would be redundant. 51. b. This is the most concise and appropriate version. 52. j. T his is the proper usage. 53. d. U sing the innitive gives the sentence parallel structure. 54. f. T his is correct as it stands. 55. c. T eam is a collective singular, so it was is the appropriate choice. 56. g. H acked is the most precise and vivid word choice. 57. d. T his sentence should be omitted; it does not t the tone and style of the essay. 58. f. T his is correct as it stands. Choice j would create a sentence fragment. 59. b. S entence 4 is off topic and should be eliminated to maintain the focus of the paragraph. 60. g. T his is best in tone and phrasing. Choice f introduces a new idea, which is not appro-priate in a conclusion. Passage V\u2014 Batman 61. d. Ea ch exclamation should be followed by an exclamation point. 62. h. T he phrase created in 1939 and known world- wide is relevant but not essential informa- tion and should be set off by commas. 155 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 63. c. The phrase beginning who was just 22 years old must be connected to an independent clause; it is not a complete sentence. A period here makes the phrase a fragment. Semicolons can only go between two inde-pendent clauses (two complete thoughts). 64. g. The correct form is the plural possessive. 65. a. Bat and like work together to form one modier, so batlike is correct. This is also the most concise choice. 66. j. O verwhelming is a more powerful and pre- cise word than big. T his version is also more concise than versions g and h. 67. c. A c omma should precede the coordinating conjunction and when it separates two inde- pendent clauses. 68. g. I n the present tense, lay is a transitive verb meaning \"to place something,\" and it requires an object; in this case, the correct word is lie, used here to mean \"be located.\" 69. b. T his version gives the sentence parallel structure and is the most logical word order. 70. f. T he sentence has consistent verb tense (all verbs in the present tense). 71. a. T his is the most appropriate transition. 72. g. T his version gives the sentence parallel structure and consistent verb tense. 73. c. T he introduction uses a comic book conven- tion to make a connection between topic and st ructure. The tone is lighthearted, but not silly. The introduction does demonstrate the effect of onomatopoeia and exclamation points, but it has a more meaningful pur - pose. It is not intended to show that there is a lot o f ghting in a typical Batman comic book, as this is not a theme of the essay. 74. h. T his is the most logical sequence, in both topic and chronology of events. 75. b. T his is a logical place to insert the sentence, since it provides a reason the show was suc-cessful and should follow the general state-ment that Batman was a success. ACT M athematics Practice Test 2 1. a. The word and indicates a decimal point. Therefore, the decimal point should go after 512 and before 16 thousandths. The number 16 must end in the thousandths place, which is three digits to the right of the decimal. 2. g. The correct order of operations must be used to simplify the expression. Y ou may remember this as PEMDAS: parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction. 3. b. The problem can also be worked with the equation 4x + 5x = 18, where x equals each unit when there are 4 units of boys and 5 units of girls. 4. h. To nd the median, place the numbers in order from least to greatest and nd the middle number. Because there are an even number of numbers, there are two middle numbers (0.024 and 0.095). Take the average of these two middle numbers. 5. d. Use the vertical line test to see if each graph is a function. A graph is not a function if any vertical line drawn goes through the graph more than once (if there is more than one y value for any x value). 6. f. -3 \u00d7 -3 \u00d7 -3 \u00d7 -3 \u00d7 -3 = -243. 7. b. Consecutive odd integers starting with 3 are being added to nd the next number. There- fore, 11 must be added to 24 to nd the next number. The answer is 35. 8. h. First, you can eliminate choices f and j because they contain numbers that are not prime. Next, use a factor tree to determine the prime factorization. The prime factor - ization of 84 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7, which can be written in exponential notation as 2 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7. 9. c. To easily see the slope, change the equation into the form y = mx + b. The equation is 7then y = 3x + 9, where m is the slope. 10. g. The perimeter is twice the width plus twice the length: P = 2w + 2l. Insert 20 for P and 4 for w, the n solve for l. 156 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 11. e. Find the lengths of the unlabeled sides by comparing them to the given sides. Find the area of each of the regions and add together to nd the total area: 30 + 28 = 58 sq. in. 12. g. Find the cost for one can (unit rate) by dividing the cost of ve cans by 5: $6.50 \u00f7 5 = $1.30 per can. Multiply the cost per can by 9 cans: $1.30 \u00d7 9 = $11.70. Nine cans cost $11.70. 13. d. Find a common denominator (15x). Multi- ply the numerator and denominator of the rst fraction by 5 and of the second fraction by 3x; then add the two numerators and place them over the common denominator. 14. j. T he endpoints are on 1.5 and 0, and the solution set includes 0 but does not include -1.5, as indicated by the open circle. 15. c. Fir st, raise everything in the parentheses to the second power; then apply the negative. 16. f. U se substitution to solve for x and y. First, solve the second equation for y. Next, substi-tute the value for y into the rst equation and sol ve for x. Finally, subtract y from x. 17. a. N otice that you are taking the cube root, not the square root. Break up the expression under the radical into perfect cubes. 18. h. S ubstitute the value 63\u00b0 for C, and solve for F. 19. c. T he equation is quadratic. Because it is fac- torable, solve the equation using factoring: ( x + 5)(x + 3) = 0. Set each of the factors equal to zero and solve for x: x + 5 = 0, x + 3 = 0, so x = -5 and x = -3. 20. g. S olve the equation for m using inverse oper - ations. 21. e. B y distributing and then using inverse oper - ations, you get the equation -7 = 10, so there ar e no values for x that make the equation true. 22. k. F actor the numerator into (4x - 1)(x + 3). Cancel out the (x + 3) in numerator and denominator, and 4x - 1 remains. 23. a. S ubtract the numbers in y from the corre- sponding numbers in x. 24. g. Lo g3x = 2 is equivalent to 32 = x. Therefore, x = 9. 25. b. U se the Pythagorean theorem to solve. To use the Pythagorean theorem (which is what the distance formula is derived from), draw the segment on a coordinate plane and create a right triangle where AC is the hypotenuse. The legs of the right triangle are 1 and 4, so the hypotenuse is the square root of 1 2 + 42, or the square root of 17. 26. f. B ecause the line is parallel to 3y - 9x = 24, they must have the same slope. Put the equa-tion into y = mx + b form to see the slope is 3 and the y-intercept is 4, so you are looking for the line y = 3x + 4. You must put the answer choices in y = mx + b form to com - pare them to this equation. 27. d. T he answer choices are spread out enough that a quick bit of guring establishes the useful range. Use the square roots that are near the answer. For 37, use 6; for 125, use 11.These will quickly lead to 66 as the cor - rect choice. 28. g. Find the p robability of each event and mul- tiply the answers to nd the probability of b oth events occurring. The probability of getting tails is 21, and the probability of roll- 1ing a 3 is 6. 29. d. M ultiply the decimal equivalent of 21%, or 0.005, by 90. 0.7530. k. Set up a proportion of = 12 x , cross multi-1 ply, and solve for x. 31. b. Convert the given rate of meters per second to kilometers per hour. First, multiply by 9.791 to change meters to kilometers. Next, 1,000 multiply that product by 60 1 to change sec- onds to minutes. Finally, multiply that prod- uct by 60 1 to changes minutes to hours. 157 100 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 32. k. To nd the number of combinations avail- 33. d. able, multiply the number of choices for ea ch element, or 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 10, which is 240. Multiply the 5 by 6 to get 30. Then multiply the powers of 10 to get 10 4, or 10,000. 30 \u00d7 10,000 = 300,000. Now convert to sci-entic notation. 34. j. sin = o pposite/hypotenuse, so you must nd the hypotenuse. To do so, use the Pythago- rean theorem (or simply recognize the P ythagorean triple). The hypotenuse is 25, so sin B = 25 7 . 35. a. T here are three pairs of sides. The two sides that measure 6 \u00d7 8 each have an area of 48. The two sides that measure 6 \u00d7 10 each have an area of 60. The two sides that measure 8 \u00d7 10 each have an area of 80. Simply multiply and add. 36. g. T he radius of the large circle is 7 (add the inner radius plus the extra 3 from the ring); therefore the area of the large circle is 49U. Subtract the area of the inner circle, which is 16U. 37. a. T ake the square root of the area to nd the length of one side, 10. When the diagonal is drawn, it creates a right triangle with legs of 10 cm each and the diagonal is the hypote-nuse. Use the Pythagorean theorem to nd the diag onal. 38. g. S ubstitute 15 for y in the equation and solve for x. 39. e. Find the n umber of students (male and female) who voted for Kristen by multiply- ing 540 by 0.60, the decimal equivalent of 60%. Multiply that product by 0.75, the dec- imal equivalent of 75%. 40. f. c os is adjacent/hypotenuse, and tan is opposite/adjacent. If cos V is 13 12, then the hypotenuse is 13. The side opposite V is 5, so opposite 5sin V = = 13 .hypotenu se41. d. T he original formula was V = lwh . If each dimension is tripled, the length is 3l, the width is 3w, and the height is 3h. When these values are substituted into the equation, the equation becomes V = (3l)(3w)(3h), or V = 27lwh . Thus the new rectangular solid has a volume 27 times the original volume. 42. k. T he sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is 180\u00b0. In a right triangle, the right angle is 90\u00b0, so another 90\u00b0 is split between the remaining two angles. Thus 7x + 8x = 90, and x = 6. The value of x is 6, but the ques- tion asks for the measure of the smaller ang le, which is 7x, or 42. 43. c. C all the width w and the length 2w. The perimeter is then P = w + w + 2w + 2w; 72 = 6w; 12 = w. The width is 12. Because the length is twice the width, the length is 24. 44. k. C all the height h and the base h + 5. The area of a triangle is 21(base \u00d7 height). Substi- tute h and h + 5 for the base and height, and se t the area equal to 80. The equation is 1h2 + 25h = 80, which is a quadratic equation. 2 Multiply both sides by 2, and subtract 160 from both sides to get h 2 + 5h - 160 = 0. Since the equation cannot be factored, use the quadratic formula to solve, and elimi-nate the negative answer since distance cannot b e negative. 45. d. T here is no need to use the distance formula if you recognize that the y-coordinate of the rst two points is the same (3). This means that the difference in the x-coordinates, which is 7, must be the length of one side of the square. 46. k. T he slope of the given equation is 3. The slope of a line perpendicular to the line is the negative reciprocal of 3, or - 31. Arrange each answer choice into the y = mx + b for - mat to nd the slope of each choice quickly. Onl y choice k has the proper slope. 158 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 47. b. T o nd the midpoint, use the midpoint for - mula, which in effect means nd the aver - ages of the two x-coordinates and the two y -coordinates. 248. j. A pply the exponent to both 21 and x . Because the exponent is negative, take the reciprocal of the fraction and the variable, 1 2 then raise both 2 and to the third power x and combine. 49. c. R ecall that all triangles have three angles that total 180\u00b0. Next, using the two angle mea- sures given, nd the two bottom angles of the t riangle. The bottom left angle is supple- mentary (adds to 180\u00b0) with 120\u00b0; therefore, it is 60\u00b0. The bottom right angle is a corre- sponding angle to the 21\u00b0 angle and, there-fore, is 21\u00b0. The three angles in the triangle m ust add to 180\u00b0, so x is 99\u00b0. 50. j. K eep in mind that a tangent line will have only one point in common with the circle. Draw the graph of the circle on the coordi- nate plane to see that the radius must be 4. 51. d. T he equation of a circle is in the form (x h)2 + (y k)2 = r2, where r is the radius. Because the given equation is already in this form, you can nd that r 2 = 36, or r = 6. Use the formula A = Ur2 to nd the area of the circle. 52. g. Find the meas ures of angles DBC and BDC by using the supplements given (remember that supplementary angles add to 180\u00b0). So angle DBC = 60\u00b0 and angle BDC = 70\u00b0. The three angles of a triangle must add to 180\u00b0. Therefore, angle BCD = 50\u00b0. 53. a. T he cosine graph goes from -1 to 1, mean- ing the cosine of an angle is between -1 and 1, inclusive, and the minimal value for cos x is -1. Now multiply by 9 to solve. 54. h. T he walkway is 10 ft. longer and 10 ft. wider than the pool (not 5 ft.) because 5 ft. is added on each side of the pool. To nd the area of the walkway, nd the area of the large rectangle (walkway and pool combined), and subtract the area of the pool. 55. b. E quilateral triangle XYZ has all 60\u00b0 angles. Because YW is an altitude, it forms a right angle and bisects the angle at Y. Thus, trian-gle XYW is a 30-60-90 triangle. The hypote-nuse YX is 10 in., and the shortest side XW is half of that, 5 in. The side opposite the 60\u00b0 angle is 3 times the short side. 56. k. U se the identity sin2A + cos2A = 1, 49 so + cos2A = 1. Now solve by subtracting 10049 from both sides, then taking the square 100 root of both sides. 57. d. T he triangle given is a 45-45-90 triangle, so the sides are in the ratio 1:1: 2. Use a pro - 2 xportion to nd x, where 1 = 5. 58. f. A n ellipse is dened by an equation such 2 2 as x 2 + y 2 = 1, where +a and -a are the x-a b intercepts, and + b and -b are the y -intercepts. Only choice f yields the correct intercepts of +5 and -5 for x, +3 and -3 for y. 59. b. N otice that the y-intercept is 2 and the slope is 3. Thus the equation must be y = 3x + 2. Answer choices b and c are possibil-ities. The shading determines which is cor - rect. Substitute (0,0) for x and y. Because the sha ding includes the point (0,0), nd the equation that is satised by the point (0,0). 60. k. T he only constraint on this function is that the denominator must not be zero. To nd which values will yield a denominator of zero, set the denominator equal to zero and solve. x 2 + 3x 4 = 0, so factoring shows (x + 4)(x 1) = 0. Now set each factor equal to zero and solve. x + 4 = 0 and x 1 = 0, so x = 4 and x = 1. These are the values that x cannot be, and the domain is written as {x | x | 4 and x | 1}. 159 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 ACT Reading Practice Test 2 Passage I\u2014Humanities 1. b. We know that statement I is untrue because lines 42-44 state the people of the North had no p articular quarrel with slavery. Immedi- ately following, the same lines also disprove stat ement III. 2. f. 3. b. The third paragraph establishes the argu-ment that rapid transit was a factor, as was the N orth's unwillingness to legally support slavery. Although some Northerners would agree with statement III, nowhere in the passage is this stated. The author agrees with the statement in lines 5-6: A state half slave and half free can- 4. h. not exist, which essentially means the entire c ountry must be for or against slavery. The passage says that because of the Fugitive Slave Law, Northerners were required to chase down runaway slaves. Later in the pas- sage, it says that the North was not willing to p lay the role of police for the South (lines 45-46); therefore, the best answer is that it forced the North to enforce laws it did not 5. d. believe were right. B ecause it is clear that the North did not approve of the Fugitive Slave Law, the power it w ould be seeking would be to remove such laws from the books. 6. j. T he answer to this question is found in lines 27-30; simply put, They saw their power waning, and this led them to encroach upon the prerogatives and independence of the Northern States by enacting such laws as the Fugitive Slave Law. 7. b. B e careful not to use any outside knowledge of the Civil War; in this case, choices a and d are, in fact, correct but are not discussed in the paragraph. 8. f. The author describes the United States as expanding in size, wealth, and population, and claims Europeans might think the United States would threaten their peace. Another way of saying this is that they are threatened by our unied strength. 9. a. Grant says Europeans believed that it would part the moment the slightest strain was brought upon it (lines 76-77), meaning that the only appropriate answer choice is a. 10. h. The nal paragraph notes the necessity of avoiding wars (line 83), which makes choices g and j incorrect. The opening line of the fourth paragraph notes that we are better off after having the war, which makes h the best choice. Passage II\u2014Natural Sciences 11. d. M any asthma sufferers have an inherited tendency to have allergies, referred to as atopy in line 42. 12. g. T he second paragraph explains that during an attack the person afflicted with asthma will attempt to compensate for constricted airways by breathing a greater volume of air. 13. c. T he passage begins with the words No lon- ger, indicating that in the past asthma was considered an anomalous inflammation of the bronchi, whereas it is now considered a chronic condition of the lungs. 14. g. W hile exacerbation usually means an increase in severity, in this passage exacerba - tions is interchangeable with attacks. 15. a. C ramping is not mentioned in the passage, whereas the other three symptoms are men-tioned in the second paragraph. 16. j. T he third paragraph discusses triggers, and only select physical activity is touted as a possible symptom reducer. 160 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 17. a. The nal paragraph notes that symptoms come and go throughout the day, making the results of a physical examination inconclusive (lines 89-91). 18. g. All the individuals listed would nd the pas-sage in some way useful; however, a health-care professional would nd the broad overview of the effects of asthma, combined with the trigger avoidance and diagnosis information, most relevant. 19. d. The middle of the third paragraph (lines 61-64) indicates that secondhand smoke puts children at risk of becoming asthmatic and may be fatal to asthmatic children. 20. g. The paragraph notes a number of factors that must be considered in the diagnosis, as well as the fact that symptoms come and go, thus making diagnosing asthma difcult. Passage III\u2014P rose Fiction 21. c. T he husband had a civil servant's job and received a steady salary, the wife had a ser - vant who cleaned for her, and the couple li ved in a dwelling that had several rooms. This implies that they lived comfortably. 22. j. T his question relates to the previous one. Choice f does not deal with the couple's eco- nomic standing, but only the wife's before she was mar ried. Choice g is tempting, but the poverty of her rooms is more in her eyes than in reality. Choice h deals with a table-cloth that could have been washed by the maid o r the wife, and the situation would have been remedied. 23. a. T he wife's thoughts in the rst paragraph indicate that she wished she had married a rich man. Instead, she slipped into marriage with a minor civil servant. 24. h. T he specic items mentioned\u2014Oriental hangings, bronze torches, or priceless knickknacks\u2014indicate an overall desire for the ner things in life. 25. b. T he husband's delight with the homemade stew only seems to send his wife into another bout of daydreams to escape her middle-class prison. 26. h. T he nal sentence includes the words grief, regret , despair, and misery, all of which would make someone morose. The other choices do not apply. 27. d. T his is reinforced at the end of the fourth paragraph: the wife admits she loves only rich things, believes she was made for them, and focuses all her desires on being admired and sought after, thinking only of herself at all times. 28. f. A djectives (words that describe nouns) are what truly add dimension to the descrip-tions of the home and the daydreams of the w ife. Innate, instinctive, grandest, gleaming, gorgeous, and pink are some of the adjectives that enrich the nouns of the wife's dreams. Shabby, worn, ugly, and homemade are adjec- tives that add to the undesirable view she has o f her present situation. None of the other choices adds such richness to the passage. 29. b. T he reasonable inference is that her friend's wealth only makes her feel worse about her own perceived meager existence. 30. h. T he narrator's insights into the woman's state of mind, and recounting of events inside the home, indicate an all-knowing, or omniscient, perspective. 161 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 Passage I V\u2014S ocial S ciences 31. c. As stated in the second paragraph, dee p, underlying ssures that already existed in the economy led to the Great Depression. 32. f. The passage is primarily an account that describes the causative factors\u2014for example, tariff and war-debt policies, disproportion- ate wealth, and the accumulation of debt\u2014 that led to the Depression, and the Depression's impact on Americans\u2014 business failures, bank closings, homeless- ness, and federal relief programs. 33. c. Paragraph 1 states that shantytowns were called Hoovervilles because citizens blamed their plight on the Hoover administration's refusal to offer assistance. 34. g. The passage makes no mention of inflation as a cause of the Depression. 35. b. Although policies can refer to regulations (laws, choice c), or guiding principles (theo-ries, choice a), in this context, p olicies refers to the courses of action (practices, choice b) taken by a government or business. 36. j. T he passage describes the decade as one in which spending dominated over prudent measures like saving (paragraph 3). The wild stock market speculation, also described in that paragraph, is another example of extravagance. 37. b. T he analogy depicts the stock market crash of 1929 as a weakening agent to the econ-omy (the way a stressful event may weaken the b ody's resistance to illness). 38. h. P aragraph 4 states that the New Deal incen- tivized farmers to slow their production in o rder to stabilize prices; it can be inferred that unchecked production could destabilize prices. 39. d. This paragraph clearly states that the New Deal expanded the role of the central gov- ernment in regulating the economy and cre- ating social assistance programs. Choice a requires an opinion about the New Deal measures, which the author does not offer. 40. h. The nal sentence of the passage indicates that one of the New Deal's accomplishments was creating social assistance programs; welfare would be one such program. ACT Science Practice Test 2 Passage I \u2014Data R epresentation 1. b. F rom the discussion of dissonance, includ- ing the content of the question, you know that b eats occur in close, but not mutually divisible, frequencies and that the number of beats per second equals the difference in cps between the two tones. Tone a is 8 cps, so b is 7 cps. The difference is 1, so there should be one beat for every eight vibrations of tone a. You can count the bumps and nd that b oth the largest and the smallest amplitude occur once every eight cycles. Answer choice c is wrong for two rea- sons. If a combination of a and d produced beats, they would be one every six cycles because that is the difference between 8 and 2.Second, the wave in e actually remains in a v ery small amplitude range but floats up and down, as if sound wave a is riding on the back of sound wave d. 2. j. H igher frequencies mean higher pitches. Tone a is 8 cps and d is one-fourth that, which is 2 cps. One octave up from 2 cps is 4 cps. Another octave up is 8 cps. Answer choice h has the direction in pitch wrong. Answer choice g is totally confused. 162 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 3. a. T he tones that compose c and e, respectively, have a maximum amplitude of 1. They can never do more than add their maxima together, so the maximum for each is no more than 2. 4. h. N oise-canceling devices depend on the prin- ciple that positive and negative wave motion canc el each other out. If any sound wave pattern, such as the ones shown here, is flipped over and played against itself, the sum of the two waves will be zero. 5. d. La ypersons are very familiar with the prob- lem of noisy buildings, but a number of sp ectacular collapses over the past century have made it mandatory that buildings be designed without any strong resonance potential. Passage II\u2014Conflicting V iewpoints 6. f. I f the velocity of separation, v, equals the speed of light, c, then T would equal 1 \u00f7 1 \u0012 12 , which = 1 \u00f7 11\u0012 or 1 \u00f7 0. 12 7. c. The rules of time dilation as given apply to how an observer reads a clock that is moving away. A and B are both moving away from each other and both observing each other. Therefore, each will measure the other's clock as slowing down. No distinction is made in the question between observer A and observer B. Therefore, answer choices a and b cannot be correct, because they say the two react differently. Answer choice d incor - rectly states that observed time speeds up, b ut the time dilation theory says it slows down. 8. j. A nswer choices f through h are relatively simple statements of proportionality. The formula for time dilation is more complex, as stated in answer choice j. 9. b. T he question asks for an answer based on what is presented on the test, and no evi-dence is presented here of the light lter e ffect described in answer choice a. There is no support for answer choice c. Answer choice d is incorrect because higher frequen- cies mean more cycles per second. If time on the e mitting object is slower than time here, its emissions would have fewer cycles per our seconds than similar radiation originating here. 10. j. A ccording to the formula, the time dilation 10 1factor will be 1 \u00f7 1 \u0012 . That is 1 or 1,2 c which is 1, which means there would be no time dilation in that case. 11. d. A ll three are consistent with the explanation of time dilation and relativistic length con-traction presented here. 12. h. I t seems intuitive that if time slows down for the objects relative to each other when they move apart, it should speed up when they move together, but answers must be based on the material presented. The formula and the model illustrated by Figure 2 produce the same results whether the objects are moving toward or away from each other. Passage III\u2014Resear ch Summary 13. c. T his is a control experiment to make sure the apparatus functions as intended. Answer choices a and b involve well-understood issues that have nothing to do with the pur - pose of the experiment. Answer choice d is inc orrect because the control experiment demonstrated only that what was put in came out. It demonstrated nothing about what always happens to DNA. 163 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 14. f. A nswer choice g is not correct because the experiment is designed to make sure all of the original DNA is heavy and all of the nitrogen newly incorporated into DNA is light. Answer choice h ignores the fact that the old heavy DNA is still in the culture. Answer choice j is incorrect because it makes an assumption contrary to the stated pur - pose of the experiment and contrary to the wa y chemical combination works. It falsely assumes that in the process of replication DNA can convert light nitrogen to heavy nitrogen. 15. c. I n the conservative method, whole DNA molecules are replicated, so the original heavy molecules would remain, and all new ones would be light. There would be no other weights represented. In the semicon- servative method, each of the two DNA st rands is preserved and forms a second strand using only light nitrogen. The disper - sive method, in which the strands are broken up and r eplicated in pieces, is the only one in which uneven mixtures of heavy and light can exist. 16. j. I f the conservative method were used, the only possible result is half heavy and half light DNA. In subsequent trials, the disper - sive method could produce various weights, as diff erent-sized pieces of the strands are broken up and replicated, but the rst trial would, like the semiconservative method, produce half heavy, half light DNA. 17. a. A nswer choice c is incorrect because once a principle is denitively proven, no extra insurance is required. Answer choice d is incorrect for the reasons given in answer choice a. 18. j. U sing the semiconservative method, which is what the experiment proves nature does, every replication cycle means that each strand produces a new DNA strand out of itself plus one created using only light nitro-gen. The existing light nitrogen DNA will p roduce new light nitrogen DNA. The exist- ing intermediate DNA will produce half int ermediate and half light nitrogen DNA. Hence each cycle will halve the percentage of intermediate DNA. Answer choice f ignores the fact that the square of a negative number is positive. Answer choice g changes the for - mula from what is presented by the question w ithout presenting any scientic reason for doing this. Passage IV\u2014R esearch S ummary 19. c. T he fact that all of the charges are multiples of the same number, rather than having a continuous or random change in value, sug- gests that 159 is the charge on a single parti- cle and that all of the other charges equal the n umber of particles \u00d7 159. Answer choice a simply states what the passage said was the order in which the table was arranged. Answer choice b points to a clue that there are even multiples in the result, but it does not correctly identify the fact that all of the numbers are even multiples of a least factor. Answer choice d is not signicant, because this is a random sampling of oil droplets. 164 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 20. g. Knowing the ratio of mass to charge means that you can calculate either mass or charge from the other as stated. Once the charge per particle was known, calculating the mass was easy. Answer choice f would give the mass of oil, not the mass of an electron. Answer choice h is incorrect because it assumes the weight of an electron equals the weight of a proton, even though the second sentence of the passage states that it does not. Answer choice j would give the average charge, but the question is asking about the mass. 21. d. Answer choice a draws conclusions not pre- sented in the report of the experiment. Answer choices b and c refer to things already known through experiment 1. 22. f. Answer choices g , h, and j refer to issues not mentioned in the description. 23. d. Answer choices a and b were known already by experiment 1. Answer choice c was known by experiment 2. The importance of experiment 3 is the combination of proving that the charge exists only in discrete units and proving how minuscule the mass of these units is. That combination is not estab- lished before experiment 3. 24. j. Answer choices f and g are true but do not prove the theory. Answer choice h is a state- ment of arithmetic usage but is not a physi-cal principle. Passage V\u2014Data Representation 25. a. I t shows the pendulum hanging vertically, which is what 0\u00b0 from the vertical is, and then swinging up to a nearly horizontal position, which is what 89\u00b0 from the vertical is. Illustration b swings in the right direc-tion, but the pendulum chain shrinks out as it g oes. Illustration c swings from 89\u00b0 to 0\u00b0. Illustration d swings only halfway, and it stretches as it goes. 26. h. T hey are both 14.142 m. This makes sense because at 45\u00b0 the height and radius form an isosceles right triangle with the pendulum chain. 27. d. T he sin and cosine are the most important trigonometric functions used in mathemati-cal physics. They follow the same pattern but ar e always 90\u00b0 out of synch with each other. Answer choice a is not true, as they are both measured from the center of the circle, not from the pendulum bob. Answer choice b makes a true statement in support of the incorrect answer. Answer choice c is a true statement in support of the correct answer, but the fact that they cross at the midway point does not demonstrate that they are the same shape. 28. j. T his is conrmed by the formula for veloc- ity, V = tan(0-)RAg . The tangent function is the opposite leg of a right triangle divided by the adjacent leg. At 90\u00b0 the adjacent leg shrinks to zero and the opposite leg increases innitely, so the tangent function always zooms up to innity at 90\u00b0. 29. c. T his follows from the discussion of question 28. Answer choice b has a conceptual error. It is true that when the pendulum is func-tioning, R H equals the force of gravity divided by the centripetal force. However, it is the forces of gravity and velocity that control the centripetal force, not the centripetal force that controls the force of gravity. That pro- portionality means that as H approaches zero, the centripetal force will have to increase toward the innite. 165 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 Passage VI\u2014Research S ummary 30. f. Answer choice g is plausible based on gen- eral knowledge of biology and chemistry, but it is not what was discussed in the pas-sage. Answer choice h confuses material included in the passage. Answer choice j is accurate, with some exceptions, and the passage makes it clear that carbon 14 dating depends on this fact, but the fact does not explain how carbon 14 dating works. 31. c. The ratio decreases as the artifact ages. The spear shank with an N/N r atio of 0.500 is o the oldest artifact. 32. h. The passage says that the half-life of carbon 14 is 5,732 years. The N/N r atio of the spear o shank is 0.500, which means that half of the original carbon 14 is gone. 33. b. Bone fragment 2 and the ivory fragment are in adjoining decades and could have begun dying at the same time, but bone fragment 1 is at least a decade away. Answer choice a is wrong as to timing, but even if the timing were correct, there is no information given to indicate these artifacts might be from the same animal. Answer choice c gives the wrong order. Higher numbers in the years ago column indicate earlier years than smaller numbers. Answer choice d seems to be correct for most of this small table, but the rate of radioactive decay is logarithmic, not constant. 34. j. N /N is the ratio of the remaining carbon 14 o concentration to the original concentration. The original concentration is one part in 1 trillion, so when the graph crosses the 0.1 line, it is one in 10 trillion. Figure 1 makes answer choice g's statement about the dif- culties in using the method beyond 50,000 y ears clear. Answer choice h cannot be pre- cisely determined from this long-range g raph, but the passage states that the half-life of carbon 14 is 5,732 years. On questions with an \"all of the above\" choice, if two of the three answers are denitely correct, \"all of the above\" is a safe choice even if the third answer is uncertain. Of course, if the third answer is denitely wrong, reconsider whether the other two are correct. 35. c. T he description of study 1 and other refer - ences throughout the passage make it clear that the car bon 14 method is based on the idea that carbon 14 concentrations remain at their original level within living organisms and begin decaying when the organisms die. Answer choice a is the common denition of age applied to living organisms. Answer choice b may or may not be correct for the particular instance it presents, but it does not apply in all cases. Passage VII\u2014Data Representation 36. g. A nswer choice f is based on a preconceived idea of what the ordering should be, but it is not supported by the data. Answer choice h attempts to explain away the unexpected result, but the data are an average of the samples, not a total. Answer choice j dis-misses the ndings as uninteresting rather than r eporting on them. 37. c. R eading the scatter plot from the top down makes this very clear. 166 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 38. j. T he similarity between the densities of the two types of samples from the iron cap, and the clustering of the soil samples in two nar - row ranges indicates an environmental d ependence, but there are not enough data on which to state its precise nature. The data tend to refute answer choice g because iron ores are richer in iron than soil is, yet the soil seems to have more MTBs. Answer choice h is not at all supported, because the relation-ship between color characterizations and MTB d ensity is quite random. 39. a. T he data from the soil samples make it clear that the bacteria can take in iron in relatively iron-poor environments as well as from iron ore. No evidence is provided to support answer choice b. Given the limited condi-tions in which nuclear transformations o ccur, choice c would be highly unlikely. 40. j. S ample M3 has only 90.5 mg of MTBs, but sample M10 is the highest in the study, with 4,139.0 mg. The range in the primary ore samples is less than 2,000 mg, in iron cap soil it is about 1,100 mg, and in iron cap ore it is about 100 mg. ACT Writing Practice Test 2 Sample \"S core 6\" Essay Picture your beloved pet\u2014a dog, cat,bird, or hamster\u2014being killed, thenshipped to one of thousands ofschools to be dissected by students,many of whom are just taking thecourse for credit and who have no real interest in learning about healthor biology. Now picture an unknownanimal. Does the fact that the animal wasn't someone's pet make it any dif- ferent? Your pet has emotions; itshows love, loyalty, fear, and pain.Obviously, these attributes are not unique to animals that are pets. Allanimals have these feelings. That iswhy using any animal for dissection iscruel, a violation of the animal's rights, and completely unnecessary. The use of animals for dissec- tion in schools is cruel. No matter how \"humanely\" the animals are putto death, they are still losing theirlives. Some of them lose their lives quite young\u2014before they even have achance to live. Some schools use piglets as dissection animals inclasses. Beyond that, some of theseanimals are specifically bred for dis- section purposes. They live their lives in cages basically only being providedthe bare necessities until they are putto sleep. Not only does this maketheir death cruel; it makes their lives cruel as well. Animals have rights. Just like humans, animals have the right to livetheir lives and pursue happiness. Manyanimals enjoy their lives. You can tellwhen an animal is happy. Whether itbe a dog that runs and plays and wagsits tail, a cat that contentedly curlsup on your lap, a horse that prancesin the field, or a bird that singsfallanimals show their enjoyment of life.We have no right to take that lifeaway just because we are bigger orstronger or have more power thanthey do. This is the worst form ofbullying. Opponents to this idea citesurvival of the fittest or the biblical tradition of having dominion over theearth to support the use of animalsin this way. However, simply becausehumans have advanced technologicalknowledge does not necessarily mean 167 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 that the human species is morally or emotionally better than other animals.Therefore, we should not simply useanimals for our purposes. Finally, the use of animals for dissection in school classes is com- pletely unnecessary. Because we as humans have advanced knowledge oftechnology, we should use it. It isnow entirely possible to re-create theinternal and external images of animals(and humans) via computer technol- ogy. Rather than continuing to take the lives of innocent animals, stu-dents should use the information already gained and catalogued in com-puter programs to study scienceissues. Not only does this save thelives of animals, but it is probablysafer for students because now theydo not have to be concerned with contracting a disease while dissectingan infected animal. We have been destroying animals for our own selfish purposes longenough. It's time to use the brainswe were given (or have developed) tomake the world a better place for allits inhabitants, not just humans. Critique This essay shows an excellent and insightful under - standing of the prompt. The student takes a clear stand on the issue and uses specic details and exam- ples (explaining how animals enjoy their lives) to s upport the thesis. The student provides a counterar - gument in paragraph 3: H owever, simply because humans have advanced technological knowledge does not necessarily mean that the human species is morally or emotionally better than other animals. In the fourth paragraph, the student provides a strong argument combined with a solution to the problem (using computer-generated images). The essay is well orga-nized with good use of transitions. It shows a strong c ommand of written language and contains virtually no grammatical errors while showing sophisticated vocabulary and varied sentence structure. Sample \" Score 5\" Essay What's more important\u2014animals or humans? The students on campuswho are crying out against the use ofanimals for dissection in science classes obviously think animals aremore important. This is a nice senti-ment, but what will those same stu-dents say when someone in theirfamily contracts an illness and a trialdrug to cure the illness needs to betested on an animal? Then they mighthave a different story. I believe thatwe should continue to use animals in science classes. First of all, using animals for dissection is not cruel. People believethat animals feel the same way aboutdeath as humans do. I disagree. Maybeanimals show emotion or maybe wejust think they show emotions. Ani- mal behaviorists have a difficult time figuring out how much emotion ani-mals have as opposed to how muchwe just perceive. Either way, animalsjust do not have the higher thinkingpower to worry about death the waywe do. As long as they are put todeath humanely, I don't think the ani-mals even understand that they aredying. They just feel very sleepy. Another argument these student activists have is that the animals are bred for dissection and don't have fulfilling lives. Again, I don't thinkanimals have the higher order of 168 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 thinking to worry about whether or not their lives have been fulfilled. Because it would be dangerous to use a diseased animal in a class dissection, the animals we dissect are healthy andusually adult. So they have lived theirlives, and they have been well-caredfor or they wouldn't be healthy. Andthe bottom line again is, I don't thinkthe animals even know any better. Finally, it is necessary to use ani- mals for dissection in science classes. Students learn a great deal bystudying real organs and tissues.Some of these students will eventu-ally go on to become doctors orresearchers who will eventually save people's lives. I think the sacrifice of a frog, rat, or pig is well worth that. I don't think reading or looking at pic-tures in a book has the same educa- tional value or will spark the same passion in students to advance their scientific education and careers. Ultimately, there are more impor- tant things in the world to protest than whether or not a rat or a frogwinds up on a dissection table. Stu-dents should put their energies intomore worthwhile causes\u2014causes that will help humankind, the way animaldissection ultimately does. Critique This essay shows a good understanding of the prompt and offers some specic arguments to support the idea that animals should be used for dissection. The indirect thesis statement is a bit weak, but it clearly states the writer's point of view. The essay uses logical arguments and contains counterarguments in para-graphs 2 and 3. The essay shows a good command of written language but lacks the style and sophistica-tion of a model score 6 essay. Sample \" Score 4\" Essay I have been brought up to believe that all life is precious and that the lifeof an animal is not to be taken unless it's for a very good reason. I love allanimals and I am very upset about theanimal dissections that occur in sci-ence classes. I think this is cruel both for the animals and for the students. Dissecting an animal is cruel for the animal itself. Even though the ani-mals are already dead when they aredissected, I still think the whole process is cruel. The poor animalsthat are used in science class are bred just for dissection purposes.It's like they don't even have a reallife. As soon as they're big and oldenough, they are killed and shipped toschools for dissection. Even the dis- section is cruel. Sure the animal is dead, but now instead of being able tojust rest in peace, the poor thing iscut up and all its parts are taken out.Think about your favorite pet. Wouldyou like it if your cat or dog died andthen someone came in and started cutting it all apart? The whole process of dissection is also cruel for students. Some students actually get sick from thesmell and from having to handle theinsides of an animal. I've been in classes where students had to stopdissecting because they felt faint andnauseated. Emotionally, it is hard onsome students to have to deal with death. They see something that was 169 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 once alive, and it is now dead. It reminds them of pets or even peoplewho have died. This can be veryupsetting to some students. There are also other students like me who simply become upsetwhen they think about how these ani-mals died for no reason. Some stu-dents may even have moral or religiousideas that state that killing a livingthing is wrong. The school shouldnot force these students to goagainst their beliefs by making themhandle a dead animal. School should be an enjoyable place for students to learn. Cuttingup animals makes school an uncom- fortable place and a place that brings up a lot of bad feelings in some stu- dents. School should be a place where values are supported, especiallythe value of life. Critique This essay shows a good understanding of the assign - ment. The thesis statement is clear and fairly well sup- ported in the body of the essay with details and e xamples, although some ideas in paragraphs 3 and 4 are a bit repetitive. The essay contains a weak attempt at a counterargument in paragraph 2: Even though the animals are already dead when they are dissected, I still think the whole process is cruel. The arguments against dissection of animals are logical. This essay is well organized overall, with each body paragraph develop - ing an idea to support the thesis that dissection is cruel f or animals and students. The essay shows an adequate command of written language but lacks sophistication in vocabulary use and sentence structure. Sample \" Score 3\" Essay There are some students in this school who refuse to dissect animals. They say they feel sorry forthe animals. I think they are wrong.Dissecting animals is part of what wehave to do for our grade, and the ani- mals are allready dead so they don't know what's going on. Dissecting animals gives us the chance to see some really coolthings. Seeing stuff in a book is notthe same as seeing it in real life. Itsimportant for students to haveexperiances like this in life. We willlearn and remember stuff better if we see it and do it for ourselves. Learningabout pigs or frogs will help us learnmore about ourselves and how our body works. Another thing is that the animals are dead allready, so we don't have tokill them. They do it in a humane way,which means the animals do not feel anything, they just die. Once theirdead, they don't feel anything, so cut- ting them up is not a problem. Plus, its not like were just going to hackthem to pieces. We are going to care-fully cut and remove some of theorgans. You could think of it as theanimals are doing a good thing in theirlife by helping us learn. I don't feel sorry for the ani- mals. That's part of what their therefor, to help students learn. I thinkdissecting them is fine and studentsshould'nt worry so much about theanimals. Critique This essay shows an adequate understanding of the assig nment. The thesis statement is a bit weak: Dis- secting animals is part of what we have to do for our g rade, and the animals are allready dead so they don't 170 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 2 know what's going on. However, the rest of the essay supports it adequately with some logical arguments. The essay would have been stronger with better orga-nization and better development using specic exam- ples. The essay is a bit repetitive in paragraphs 1 and 3. It contains a weak counterargument in paragraph 3: Plus, its not like were just going to hack them to piec es. We are going to carefully cut and remove some of the organs. The essay shows some command of writ- ten language but contains some simplistic sentences w ith simple vocabulary (Seeing stuff in a book is not the same as seeing it in real life, Another thing is that) and some awkward sentences (That's part of what their there for, to help students learn). There are some spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, but they do not make the composition very difcult to read or understand. Sample \" Score 2\" Essay Some people think dissecting animals in class is wrong, others don't care.I don't like to dissect animals but I don't think it's really wrong either.Animals can be pets or they can belike lab rats. You wouldn't want to dissect a pet, but its ok to dissect alab rat. A pet gives you love and com- panionship. You would be upset if it died. A lab rat is just a thing in acage. Its purpose is bassically to getdissected. As long as the animal wasment to be dissected I don't have a problem with it. But I wouldn't wantto see )ifi on my lab table. Critique This essay shows a very weak understanding of the p rompt. The writer does not take a clear stand on the issue, as shown in the weak thesis statement. The essay drifts a bit off track by focusing on the differ - ences between pets and lab animals. It is undeveloped and shows a weak command of written language, as e videnced by grammatical and spelling errors. Sample \" Score 1\" Essay I do not want to dissect animals in sience class.

I will have toleave class and not come back until its done. I think frogs and pigs arecute and I will get very sad to have tocut it up. We did a worm once and Ieven fealt bad about that. Also the smell. It is grose and makes me sick. Please don't let us have to dis- sect animals. We can just look at apicture and that's it. Critique This essay shows a poor understanding of the assign-ment. The writer makes it clear that he or she does not want to dissect an animal but does not give logi- cal arguments against animal dissection as a school p olicy. There is no clear thesis statement; therefore, the body paragraph does not really support a particu-lar belief. It simply explains what will happen if the w riter has to dissect an animal. The essay is not devel- oped enough to show an overall organizational pat-tern, and the paragraphs themselves lack strong o rganization. For example, paragraph 2 deals with several different topics at once, without developing any one of them. The language used shows a weak command of written language with simplistic sen-tence structure and simple vocabulary. There are sp elling, grammar, and punctuation errors that sometimes make the composition difcult to read and understand. 171 ACTPP_03_93_172.indd 172 9/27/11 3:36 PMCHAPTER4 ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 This is the third of four complete practice ACT tests in this book.

Passage I\u2014The Weekly Visit The requisite visit happened most typically1 on sunny Saturdays, when my child spirits were at their highest and could be most diminished by the cramped interior of her house. My mother, accustomed to the bright spacious farmhouse 2 that was once Grandma's, seemed no less sus-ceptible to the gloom. She would set her jaw as G randma described the many ailments atten- dant on age and would check her watch\u2014an hour is 3 the minimum she expected herself to withstand. Her barely contained impatience, and4 my grandmother's crippling age radiated out around me. We were the women of the Carlson clan, each throbbing with agitation, like eccentric, 5 blinking circles on a radar screen. (1) I would sit at the white, red, metal tab le6 with the pull-out leaves and built-in sil- verware drawer, cracking almonds. (2) I would b e lifting7 the lid carefully and try to set it down on the metal table quietly, and then attempt to cr ack the nuts without scattering the shell crumbs. (3) This was the one good thing at Grandma's house, the almonds, which she kept in a green Depression glass bowl. (4) It was not good to draw attention to myself at Grandma C arlson's house.8 Sounding angry, she would call to me in her croupy drawl. When I failed to understand her, she would reach out to me with her palsied, slick, wrinkled hand and shout, \"Here\"! 9 She would be offering some of her horehound candy, which tasted like a cross between butterscotch and bitter sticks. There was this lamentable air in the dim house with its itchy mohair furniture and its dark colors, an awareness\u2014Grandma's\u2014 underlaying 10 the mentholatum, that her age scared her grandkids. I would during the duti- ful visit yearn11 to get outside into the yard, where Grandma had transplanted a few flowers when she moved from the farm. But even the yard, with its overgrown hedges and rusted metal lawn chairs, 12 seemed dreary. When I came back inside, light and air would burst in with me. Grandma, her hair up in a gray bun, would rock a little and smile. 13 I would lean then against my mother's chair, Grandmas' fond eyes14 peering at me, and whisper out of the corner of my mouth, \"Mom, can we go?\" 1. a.

I am very close to most of my siblings and I treasure my relationships with them. But when I have had 17 my own family someday, it won't be as big as the one I grew up in. As much as my large family was full of love, and as much as I learned about sharing, giving, and patience, I think having too many kids strains the parents and the oldest child, both in terms of emotion and money. 18 (1) When I think back on my early years w ith my family, I remember playing with my siblings and grandparents. (2) However, I19 don't remember spending a whole lot of time with my mother and father. (3) They were always around, but they were always busy. (4) My mother was always cooking, cleaning, nurs-ing, changing a diaper, shopping, or had to tak e20 someone to baseball practice, and my father was always working. (5) He needed over - time whenever he could get it; and weekends21 were always full of projects around the house. (6) Money was also a constant worry for my famil y. (7) With so many children, our budget was always tight. (8) Back-to-school shopping was always a stressful time as we 22 all wanted the latest fashions, but we could only get a few things. My younger siblings lived in hand-me-downs. We shopped at bargain stores and often got clothes that we didn't really like simply b ecause they were on sale and cheap.23 Our house always needed repairs, and there was never enough money to keep up. And yet another 24 problem with large families is that the older siblings always end up being a babysitter. 25 Like it or not (and most of the time I didn't like it), I had to watch my younger brothers and sisters. At age six, I could change a diaper like a pro. I was getting my brothers and sisters dressed, giving them breakfast, and helped them get ready for bed. 26 I don't want to give the impression that I didn't have a happy childhood; I most denitely did. I was loved as much as my parents could love me, and I have had 27 wonderful fun with my broth- ers and sisters. But I always wanted a little more t ime with Mom and Dad, and I often resented having so much responsibility. I wished my mom wasn't always so tired and my dad didn't have to work so much. Because I want to be there more for my kids, because I want 28 them to be kids throughout their childhood, I plan to have a much smaller family. 16. f.

Passage III\u2014The Internet Revolution In today's world, when a question needs to be answered, information needs to be located, or people contacted, 31 the rst place people turn to is often the Internet. The Internet has supplanted the traditional encyclopedia. As 32 well as a number of other sources of service and information. We can make reservations, plan vacations, play interaction 33 games, learn a language, listen to music or radio programs, read the newspaper, and nd out about a medical condition, without coming face-to-face with another person.

Passage IV\u2014The Letter As many of you knew, but some do not,46 an extraordinary charity has existed for the last nine years. The Scotty W. Memorial Fund was created by Scotty's extended family and spearheaded by his brother, Rob, to honor the memory of Scotty, who died when the World Trade Center towers were attacked on 9/11. The fund has achieved some extraordinary things, including creating a college scholarship in Scotty's name in perpetuity,47 and donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Kane Cancer Research Center. The fund's sponsors 48 hold a variety of fund-raising events year-round, and the centerpiece of these events is the Play Ball Weekend, held annually in Woodstock, New York, on the anniversary of 9/11. It is about this event that we contact 49 you. First, let me mention that we were, and will be,50 extremely hesitant to send this note, for a number of reasons. Many people are not big fans of impersonal, group mailings when they receive them, and we initially cringed at the idea of sending one. We were also excep - tionally 51 hesitant to solicit donations by e-mail. At any rate for any number of reasons,52 fund-raising for our event this year has been more difcult than usual, and we are trying to explore all possible fund-raising means. Please 184 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 accept our apologies if anyone feels the least bit offended or feel 53 this to be inappropriate. Back to the event, which will take place Saturday, September 11, in Woodstock New York. 54 If you have a moment to go to the Scotty IX website, perhaps you can get a sense55 of the event. In short, it is a joyous, loving, wonderful weekend\u2014quite remarkable, given the horric nature of its roots. People travel from all around the country to attend. The premise is an athletic (although as we all get older it becomes increasingly less athletic) com- petition56 between teams of four people; the purpose is to remember and honor Scotty's life, to remember to celebrate life itself, and to raise money for great causes. Simplier put, 57 it's our favorite weekend of the year. Any size donation would be wonderful and deeply appreciative.58 For every $100 donated you will receive one raffle ticket, with prizes ranging from flat screen TVs to $10,000 cash. Event hats and T-shirts are provided to all donors. These are difcult nancial times for many, and you may understandably not be in a position to make a donation. We also understand that many of you already donate to other important charities. If you would, however, care to make a donation, you would be becoming 59 part of a growing group who support our efforts. You would become part of the extended Scotty W. family. In any case, thanks for taking the time to read this, and please except in advance 60 our gratitude for any donation you make. 46. f. NO CHANGE g. As many of you know, but some did not, h.

It is hard not to marvel at the fact that these sh travelling 62 hundreds of miles, back to where their lives began, to spawn. Folklore claims that in order to spawn the sh return to the exact spot where they were born, and recent tracking studies have shown this to be true; but 63 the nature of how this memory works has long been debated. Some travel as many as 900 miles to lay their eggs, which are also known as roes. 64 While only a small percentage of the eggs the salmon lay ever survive to adulthood, the trip they make to lay these eggs remain 65 remarkable. The life cycle of the salmon are66 fairly simple to understand. After nding their way into the salt water as baby sh, salmon spend from between one to ve years in the ocean. 67 When it is time for them to breed, they start their journey back to their original breeding grounds, which is where they deposit their roe. The sh face many numerous dangers 68 and obstacles as they go. Swimming upstream against the current and going past rapids are two obstacles, but 69 some salmon even jump up waterfalls, which shows how intense their instinct is. One type, the Snake River salmon, climbs 7,000 feet to their spawning grounds above the Pacic Ocean\u2014all to return home and continue the cycle of life, a process that's imperative giving 70 the Snake River salmon's classication as an endangered species. In addi- tion to the perils of the water, the salmon must also o vercome another71 obstacle, shermen who are anxious to catch these tasty sh. When they do make it back to their original breeding grounds, they lay thousands of eggs. 186 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 Salmon has a long history as a sustain- 65. a.

Read each passage carefully and then select the best possible answer for each question. Passage I\u2014Humanities In 1804 President Thomas Jefferson sent army ofcers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on an expedi - tion to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase a nd beyond and to look for a waterway that would connect the Atlantic and Pacic oceans. This passage describes the collision of cultures that occurred between Native Americans and the representatives of the U.S. government. 1W hen Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark 2into the West, he patterned their mission on the 3methods of Enlightenment science: to observe, 4collect, document, and classify. Such strategies 5were already in place for the epic voyages made 6by explorers like Cook and Vancouver. Like 7their contemporaries, Lewis and Clark were 8more than representatives of European ratio - 9 nalism. They also represented a rising American 10 empire, one built on aggressive territorial 11 expansion and commercial gain. 12 But there was another view of the West: 13 that of the native inhabitants of the land. Their 14 understandings of landscapes, peoples, and 15 resources formed both a contrast and a counter - 16 po int to those of Jefferson's travelers. One of 17 Lewis and Clark's missions was to open diplo - 18 m atic relations between the United States and 19 the Native American nations of the West. As Jef - 20 f erson told Lewis, \"It will now be proper you 21 should inform those through whose country you 22 will pass . . . that henceforth we become their 23 fathers and friends.\" When Euro-Americans and 24 Na tive Americans met, they used ancient diplo - 25 mat ic protocols that included formal language, 26 ceremonial gifts, and displays of military power. 27 But behind these symbols and rituals there were 28 often very different ways of understanding 29 power and authority. Such differences some - 30 t imes made communication across the cultural 31 divide difcult and open to confusion and 32 misunderstanding. 33 An important organizing principle in 34 Euro-American society was hierarchy. Both sol - 35 die rs and civilians had complex gradations of 36 rank to dene who gave orders and who 37 obeyed. While kinship was important in the 38 Euro-American world, it was even more funda - 39 me ntal in tribal societies. Everyone's power and 40 place depended on a complex network of real 41 and symbolic relationships. When the two groups 42 met\u2014whether for trade or for diplomacy\u2014 43 each tried to reshape the other in the group's 44 own image. Lewis and Clark sought to impose 45 their own notions of hierarchy on Native 46 Americans by \"making chiefs\" with medals, 47 printed certicates, and gifts. Native people 49 tried to impose the obligations of kinship on 40 the visitors by means of adoption ceremonies, 50 shared names, and ritual gifts. 51 The American republic began to issue 52 peace medals during the rst Washington 53 administration, continuing a tradition estab - 54 lishe d by the European nations. Lewis and 55 Clark brought at least 89 medals in ve sizes in 56 order to designate ve \"ranks\" of chief. In the 57 eyes of Americans, Native Americans who 58 accepted such medals were also acknowledging 59 American sovereignty as \"children\" of a new 60 \"great father.\" And in a moment of imperial 61 bravado, Lewis hung a peace medal around the 62 neck of a Piegan Blackfeet warrior killed by the 63 expedition in late July 1806. As Lewis later 64 explained, he used a peace medal as a way to let 65 the Blackfeet know \"who we were.\" 198 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 66 In tribal society, kinship was like a legal 67 system\u2014people depended on relatives to pro- 68 tect them from crime, war, and misfortune. 69 People with no kin were outside of society and 70 its rules. To adopt Lewis and Clark into tribal 71 society, the Plains Indians used a pipe cere- 72 mony. The ritual of smoking and sharing the 73 pipe was at the heart of much Native American 74 diplomacy. With the pipe the captains accepted 75 sacred obligations to share wealth, aid in war, 76 and revenge injustice. At the end of the cere- 77 mony, the pipe was presented to them so they 78 would never forget their obligations. 79 Gift giving was an essential part of diplo- 80 macy. To Native Americans, gifts proved the 82 giver's sincerity and honored the tribe. To Lewis 82 and Clark, some gifts advertised the technologi- 83 cal superiority and others encouraged the 84 Native Americans to adopt an agrarian lifestyle. 85 Like salesmen handing out free samples, Lewis 86 and Clark packed bales of manufactured goods 87 to open diplomatic relations with Native Amer - 89 ican tribes. Jefferson advised Lewis to give out 90 corn mills to introduce the Native Americans to 91 mechanized agriculture as part of his plan to 92 \"civilize and instruct\" them. Clark believed the 93 mills were \"verry Thankfully recived,\" but by 94 the next year the Mandan had demolished 95 theirs to use the metal for weapons. 1. The goals of the Lewis and Clark expedition inc lude all of the following purposes EXCEPT to a. expand scientic knowledge. b. strengthen American claims to western t erritory. c. overcome Native American resistance with militar y force. d. introduce native inhabitants to the ways of E uro-American culture. 2.

Miss T emple, through all changes, had thus far c ontinued superintendent of the seminary; to her instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace: she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly, companion. At this period she married, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me. From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to me. I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better-regulated feelings had become inmates of my mind. I had given in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued character. But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. N asmyth, came between me and Miss Temple: I saw her in her traveling dress step into a post-chaise, shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill and disap-pear beyond its brow; and then retired to my o wn room, and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honor of the occasion. I walked about the chamber most of the t ime. I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery 200 - - IIIACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 38 dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I 39 had undergone a transforming process; that my 40 mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss 41 Temple\u2014or rather that she had taken with her 42 the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in 43 her vicinity\u2014and that now I was left in my nat- 44 ural element, and beginning to feel the stirring 45 of old emotions. It did not seem as if a prop 46 were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were 47 gone; it was not the power to be tranquil which 49 had failed me, but the reason for tranquility 40 was no more. My world had for some years 50 been in Lowood: my experience had been of its 51 rules and systems; now I remembered that the 52 real world was wide, and that a varied eld of 53 hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, 54 awaited those who had courage to go forth into 55 its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life 56 amidst its perils. 57 I went to my window, opened it, and 58 looked out. There were the two wings of the 59 building; there was the garden; there were the 60 skirts of Lowood; there was the hilly horizon. 61 My eye passed all other objects to rest on those 62 most remote, the blue peaks: it was those I 63 longed to surmount; all within their boundary 64 of rock and heath seemed prison ground, exile 65 limits. I traced the white road winding round 66 the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a 67 gorge between two: how I longed to follow it 68 further! I recalled the time when I had traveled 69 that very road in a coach; I remembered 70 descending that hill at twilight: an age seemed 71 to have elapsed since the day which brought me 72 rst to Lowood, and I had never quitted it 73 since. My vacations had all been spent at 74 school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to 75 Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family 76 had ever been to visit me. I had had no com- 77 munication by letter or message with the outer 78 world: school-rules, school-duties, school- 79 habits and notions, and voices, and faces, and 80 phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and 81 antipathies: such was what I knew of existence. 82 And now I felt that it was not enough: I 83 tired of the routine of eight years in one after - 84 noon. I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for 85 liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on 86 the wind then faintly blowing. I abandoned it 87 and framed a humbler supplication; for change, 88 stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off 89 into vague space: \"Then,\" I cried, half desperate, 90 \"grant me at least a new servitude!\" 11.

Passage III\u2014Social Sciences This passage describes the public's growing interest in alternative medicine practices in twenty-rst-century United States. 1Once people wore garlic around their necks to 2ward off disease. Today, most Americans would 3scoff at the idea of wearing a necklace of garlic 4cloves to enhance their well-being. However, 5you might nd a number of Americans willing 6to ingest capsules of pulverized garlic or other 7herbal supplements in the name of health. 8 Complementary and alternative medicine 9 (CAM), which includes a range of practices 10 outside of conventional medicine such as herbs, 11 homeopathy, massage, yoga, and acupuncture, 12 holds increasing appeal for Americans. In fact, 13 according to one estimate, 42% of Americans 14 have used alternative therapies. A Harvard 15 Medical School survey found that young adults 16 (at the time of the study, those born between 17 1965 and 1979) are the most likely to use alter - 18 native treatments, whereas people born before 19 1945 are the least likely to use these therapies. 20 Nonetheless, in all age groups, the use of 21 unconventional healthcare practices has 22 steadily increased since the 1950s, and the trend 23 is likely to continue. 24 CAM has become a big business as Ameri- 25 cans dip into their wallets to pay for alternative 26 treatments. A 1997 American Medical Associa- 27 tion study estimated that the public spent $21.2 28 billion for alternative medicine therapies in that 29 year, more than half of which were out-of- 30 pocket expenditures, meaning they were not 202 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 31 covered by health insurance. Indeed, Americans 32 made more out-of-pocket expenditures for 33 alternative services than they did for out-of- 34 pocket payments for hospital stays in 1997. In 35 addition, the number of total visits to alterna- 36 tive medicine providers (about 629 million) 37 exceeded the tally of visits to primary care phy- 38 sicians (386 million) in that year. 39 However, the public has not abandoned 40 conventional medicine for alternative health- 41 care. Most Americans seek out alternative ther - 42 apies as a complement to their conventional 43 healthcare, whereas only a small percentage of 44 Americans rely primarily on alternative care. 45 Why have so many patients turned to alterna- 46 tive therapies? Frustrated by the time con- 47 straints of managed care and alienated by 49 conventional medicine's focus on technology, 40 some feel that a holistic approach to healthcare 50 better reflects their beliefs and values. Others 51 seek therapies that will relieve symptoms asso- 52 ciated with chronic disease, symptoms that 53 mainstream medicine cannot treat. 54 Some alternative therapies have crossed 55 the line into mainstream medicine as scientic 56 investigation has conrmed their safety and 57 efcacy. For example, today physicians may 58 prescribe acupuncture for pain management or 59 to control the nausea associated with chemo- 60 therapy. Most U.S. medical schools teach 61 courses in alternative therapies, and many 62 health insurance companies offer some alterna- 63 tive medicine benets. Yet, despite their gaining 64 acceptance, the majority of alternative therapies 65 have not been researched in controlled studies. 66 New research efforts aim at testing alternative 67 methods and providing the public with infor - 68 mation about which are safe and effective and 69 which are a waste of money, or possibly 70 dangerous. 71 So what about those who swear by the 72 health benets of the so-called smelly rose, 73 garlic? Observational studies that track disease 74 incidence in different populations suggest that 75 garlic use in the diet may act as a cancer-ghting 76 agent, particularly for prostate and stomach 77 cancer. However, these ndings have not been 78 conrmed in clinical studies. And yes, reported 79 side effects include garlic odor. 21. The author's primary purpose in the passage is to a. conrm the safety and effectiveness of alt ernative medicine approaches. b. convey the excitement of crossing new me dical frontiers. c. describe the recent increase in the use of alt ernative therapies. d. explore the variety of practices that fall into the cat egory of alternative medicine. 22. The author describes wearing garlic (lines 1-2) as an e xample of f. an arcane practice considered odd and s uperstitious today. g. the ludicrous nature of complementary and alt ernative medicine. h. a scientically tested medical practice. j. a safe and reliable means to prevent some f orms of cancer. 23.

Dentine is a mineralized connective tissue 41 with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. 42 The inorganic component of dentine consists 43 of dahllite. Dentine contains a microscopic 44 structure called dentinal tubules, which are 45 micro-canals that radiate outward through the 46 dentine from the pulp cavity to the exterior 47 cementum border. 48 These canals have different congurations 49 in different ivories, and their diameters range 50 between 0.8 and 2.2 microns. Their length is 51 dictated by the radius of the tusk. The three- 52 dimensional conguration of the dentinal 53 tubules is under genetic control and is therefore 54 a characteristic unique to the order of the 55 mammal. 56 Exterior to the dentine lies the cementum 57 layer. Cementum forms a layer surrounding the 58 dentine of tooth and tusk roots. Its main func- 59 tion is to adhere the tooth and tusk root to the 60 mandibular and maxillary jawbones. Incremen- 61 tal lines are commonly seen in cementum. 62 Enamel, the hardest animal tissue, covers 63 the surface of the tooth or tusk that receives the 64 most wear, such as the tip or crown. Amelo- 65 blasts are responsible for the formation of 66 enamel and are lost after the enamel process is 67 complete. Enamel exhibits a prismatic structure 68 with prisms that run perpendicular to the 69 crown or tip. Enamel prism patterns can have 70 both taxonomic and evolutionary signicance. 71 Tooth and tusk ivory can be carved into 72 an almost innite variety of shapes and objects. 73 Examples of carved ivory objects are netsukes, 74 jewelry, flatware handles, furniture inlays, and 75 piano keys. Additionally, warthog tusks, as well 76 as teeth from sperm whales, killer whales, and 77 hippopotamuses can also be scrimshawed or 78 supercially carved, thus retaining their origi- 79 nal shapes as morphologically recognizable 80 objects.

Ivory skin, Ivory Soap, Ivory Snow\u2014we hear i vory used all the time to describe something fair, white, and pure. But where does ivory come from, and what exactly is it? Is it natural or man-made? Is it a modier, meaning some-thing pure and white, or is it a specialized and discr ete substance? Historically, the word iv ory has been applied to the tusks of elephants. However, the chemical structure of the teeth and tusks of mammals is the same regardless of the species of origin, and the trade in certain teeth and tusks other than elephant is well established and wide-spread. Therefore, ivory can correctly be used to de scribe any mammalian tooth or tusk of com - mercial interest that is large enough to be carved o r scrimshawed. T eeth and tusks have the same origins. T eeth are specialized structures adapted for food mastication. Tusks, which are extremely large teeth projecting beyond the lips, have evolved from ordinary teeth and give certain species an evolutionary advantage that goes beyond chewing and breaking down food into digestible pieces. Furthermore, the tusk can be used to actually secure food through hunting, killing, and then breaking up large chunks of food into manageable bits. The teeth of most mammals consist of a r oot as well as the tusk proper. Teeth and tusks have the same physical structures: a pulp cavity, dentine, cementum, and enamel. The inner - most area is the pulp cavity. The pulp cavity is an e mpty space within the tooth that conforms to the shape of the pulp. Odontoblastic cells line the pulp cavity and are responsible for the production of dentine. Dentine, which is the main component of carved ivory objects, forms a layer of consistent thickness around the pulp 205 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 81 substitutes is based on the physical and chemi- 82 cal class characteristics of these materials. A 83 common approach to identication is to use 84 the macroscopic and microscopic physical 85 characteristics of ivory in combination with a 86 simple chemical test using ultraviolet light. 31.

Passage I\u2014Research Summary The forces affecting an object on an inclined plane are F G, the force due to gravity; FN, the normal force of the plane against the object; FF, the force due to friction between the object and the plane; and any other external forces applied. For the purpose of cal- culating the effects of these forces, it is usually neces- sary to analyze F G as two forces: FI, the force directed down the plane, and FP, the force perpendicular to the plane opposing the normal force. Note that FF always works against the motion of the object. If the object is sliding down the plane, friction will tend to hold it up. If the object is being pulled up the plane, friction will tend to hold it down. Figure 1 is a free body diagram illustrating the f orces that act on an inclined plane. These experiments were to test and calibrate a t ow rope that is used to pull skiers up a ski slope. The skiers hold the rope and are pulled up the slope by a FG FP FE FI FN Figure 1 207 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 motorized pulley system. Skiers can hold on to or release the tow rope at any desired point on the slope. Figure 2 illustrates the tow rope mechanism and shows the mass of four skiers (including all clothing and equipment), who participated in these experi- ments. As shown, their masses total 420 kg. The pulley engine must exert a tension force of 5,000 N (ne wtons) on the rope to balance the weight of the rope when no skiers are being towed. This is FS, the force of the system. The total tension force applied by the pulley engine on the rope is FT. A B 35 kg 210 kg 70 kg 105 kg 250 m C D FT FI FF 500 m FS Figure 1 Each skier is affected by FT, the tension force of the rope; FG; and FF. FG is the vector sum of FP and FI according to the third formula given here. The six formulas for the various forces are as fo llows: 1. FI = FG[sin(V)] 2. FP = m/s2), FG in mass in kg 4. FF = \u00b5FP where \u00b5 is the coefcient of friction 5. FS = 5,000 N 6. FNET = FT + FI + FF + FS Note that the downward direction is indicated as negative and the upward as positive. Acceleration due to gravity, FG, FI, FF, and FS, are negative. The only upward force exerted on the skiers is FT, the ten- sion force applied by the rope. The tow rope is expected to be able to tow any n umber of skiers from 0 to 40, up to a maximum mass of 4,200 kg at a constant velocity of 1.0 m/s. The total mass of all of the skiers on the rope can be treated as a single mass. To maintain a constant velocity, F NET, the net force on the skiers, must be zero. To speed up to the target velocity, there must be a net force heading up the slope. To slow down to the target velocity, there must be a net force headed down the slope. 208 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 Experiment 1 To determine what force the pulley engine must be a ble to apply, we must determine the highest coef - cient of friction that the mechanism will have to de al with. The pulley system is equipped with monitoring and regulating equipment that tracks both the veloc- ity of the rope and the force of tension (FT) applied by the rope. It also adjusts FT as necessary to maintain a constant velocity. Table 1 is a record of the results of trials on three kinds of snow towing a total skier mass of 420 kg. In each case, the highest F T for each type of snow was recorded when the tow rope was moving at a constant rate of 1.0 m/s. Experiment 2 Once a coefcient of friction has been determined for ea ch of the types of snow and it is determined which type of snow requires the greatest force, experiments are conducted with a fully loaded tow rope system to determine how closely the force actually applied to maintain the target velocity agrees with the calculated force required. Table 2 indicates the F T calculated to be required to maintain the full 4,200 kg of skiers at a constant velocity and the actual F T recorded in four different trials when they were being towed at a con- stant 1.0 m/s. 1. Which Table 1 column values are either deter - mined by the design of the experiment or cal-culated from the determined values? a. F S, FG, and FI b. FS, FG, FI, and FI + FS c. FI, FI + FS, and FF d.

Figure 1 illustrates how tsunamis are created. Overriding plate Subduction Ocean plate Figure 1a Over time the subduction plate strains the overriding plate by forcing it upward. Ocean rises Ocean Overriding plate collapses Subduction plate Figure 1b An underwater earthquake occurs when the overriding plate collapses downward, causing an upsurge of water. Coastal Coastal Ocean Open sea Figure 1c The tsunami moves away from the earth - quake site both toward the shore and out to sea. Approaching the shallow coastal water, the tsu- nami waves can be 2 to 10 meters or more high with wa velengths in the 100 meter range. In deep ocean water, they can be 10 cm to 1 m high with wave- lengths of hundreds of kilometers. A tsunami traveling on the high seas is a stealthy k iller. Much effort has been applied to developing means of detecting tsunami activity and forecasting what kind of impact one will have when it strikes land. Factors that must be taken into account for tsu- nami forecasting include the force and location of the init iating event, the ocean depth at all points affected by the tsunami or in its path, and the interaction 210 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 between the tsunami and the normal astronomical tides at all relevant points. Figures 2a and 2b illustrate the influence on t ides of the two most signicant factors. Figure 2a shows the effect of the moon's gravity, and Figure 2b shows the effect of the sun's. The earth rotates daily relative to both the sun and the moon, but the daily, or diurnal, tidal cycles do not coincide precisely with 3 a day. The moon also revolves in an approximately 28-day cycle around the earth, and the earth revolves in an approximately 365-day cycle around the sun. These and many other factors, most of which are ignored by Figures 2a and 2b, operate together to account for the day-to-day variations, even in the normal tidal cycles. Figure 2c illustrates the lunar and solar effects working in combination.

Look at the simplied model of the normal t ides in Figure 2. What in Figures 2a and 2b, which illustrate the lunar and solar influences, accounts for the marked decline over the 11-day period shown in the strength of the cumulative tides illustrated in Figure 2c? a. At the beginning of day 1, the peaks and t roughs of Figures 2a and 2b coincide, but the lunar cycle has a shorter wavelength, so that by day 9 the solar cycle's trough is almost simultaneous with the lunar cycle's peak. b. At the beginning of day 1, the peaks and t roughs of Figures 2a and 2b coincide, but the lunar cycle has a longer wavelength, so that by day 9 the solar cycle's trough is almost simultaneous with the lunar cycle's peak. c. The moon and sun each move closer and fur ther away from the earth. d. The tilt of the earth toward the sun changes da y by day. 8. Look at the graphs in Figure 3. In Figures 3d and 3e, the line labeled \"Solar tide\" indicates the level of the solar tide. The line labeled \"Lunar tide\" indicates the combined effect of the solar and lunar tides, and the \"Tsunami effect\" line indicates the cumulative effect of all three. For the four-hour periods illustrated, which factor has the greatest impact on the cumulative changes in sea level illustrated by Figures 3d and 3e? f. tsunami effect g. lunar tide h. solar tide j. The strongest individual factor cannot be d etermined. 9. Refer to Figure 2. What is the difference b etween the tsunami curves in Figures 3d and 3e and how is that related to the time at which these models begin? a. The curve in Figure 3d shows the tsunami o ccurring almost entirely above mean sea level, but the curve in 3e is largely below mean sea level. This is because at day 1, hour 4, the solar and lunar tidal influences are both reaching their peak levels, but at day 11, hour 0, they are both near the bottom of a trough. b. The height of the curve in Figure 3e is less than that in Figur e 3d because 3e begins at the highest tidal peak in the 11-day period, and 3e begins at the lowest tidal trough. c. The height of the curve in Figure 3e is less than that in Figur e 3d because 3d begins at the highest tidal peak in the 11-day period, and 3e begins at a tidal trough. d. The curve in Figure 3d shows the tsunami o ccurring almost entirely above mean sea level, but the curve in 3e is largely below mean sea level. This is because the lunar and solar tidal influences shown in Figures 2a and 2b are moving in opposite directions. 10. Look at the amplitudes of the lunar and solar t idal influences illustrated in Figures 2a and 2b. If the graph in Figure 2c were continued beyond day 11, approximately what would be the lowest peak height above mean sea level shown? f. zero g. 1.5 me te rs h. 2.0 me ters j. 4.1 me te rs 215 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 11. Based on Figure 3a and the description of a tsu- nami provided in the passage, what is occurring o n shore as the curve goes up and down? a. At minute 0, water recedes from the shore. A fter several minutes, it begins steadily returning for about 10 minutes, when it reaches a peak of 10 meters above normal sea level. It then steadily recedes and returns in approximately 30-minute cycles for almost four hours as the high and low sea levels gradually decrease. b. Every 30 minutes a huge wave breaks on the sho re and then recedes. c. At minute 0, water recedes from the shore. A fter several minutes, it begins returning for about 10 minutes, when it reaches a peak of 10 meters above normal sea level.

The inputs and the results o f photosynthesis have long been understood to be that 6 moles of carbon dioxide plus 12 moles of water, in the presence of light and chloroplasts, produces 1 mole of glucose, 6 moles of oxygen, and 6 moles of water. Chloroplasts are the complex structures con-taining chlorophyll found in green plant cells. Glu-cose is a leading storehouse of energy, not only for plants but for animals that feed on plants and for processes that use it as an energy source in abiotic reactions. The chemical formula is as follows: light energy 6CO2 + 12H2O + 6O2 + 6H2O C6H12O6chloroplasts It was also known that in between the input and output, there are many complex steps. One of these is named the Hill reaction, after its discoverer, Robert Hill. His experiments proved that oxygen is released directly from water, in the presence of chloroplasts and light, without any CO 2 involvement at all, and without necessarily occurring in living cells. The chemical formula for the Hill reaction is as f ollows: light energy 2H2O + 2A 2AH2 + O2chloroplasts In this formula, A can be any suitable electron acceptor. Within a plant cell, this would normally be adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The hydrogen and oxygen in water (H 2O) are bound together because the single excess electrons orbiting each hydrogen nucleus ll the two electron places that are available in oxygen's outer orbit. The Hill reaction requires an electron acceptor to replace oxygen's role in relation to the two hydrogen atoms and free it up to combine with other oxygen atoms, forming the normal oxygen gas molecule, O 2. Experiment 1 These experiments are based on using 2,6-dichloro-p henol-indophenol (DCPIP) as an electron accepter to free oxygen from water. DCPIP is a convenient electron acceptor to use because it changes color as the reaction occurs. In its normal oxidized form, it is blue, but when it is reduced (by giving up its oxygen and accepting electrons from hydrogen) it turns col- orless. One drawback is that it quickly takes on oxy- gen and regains its color, which makes truly accurate r eadings very difcult. The main ingredient for the experiments is a sl urry of chloroplasts extracted from green leaves. The objective is to compare how the Hill reaction proceeds under differing circumstances, so it is essen-tial that slurry from the same batch of chloroplasts, 216 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 preserved by refrigeration in between trials, is used For experiment 1, all trials are conducted under iden- for each experiment. tical lighting with the test mixture at a temperature of For each experiment, three different prepara- 20\u00b0C.

It is measured from the vicinity of the earth's surface through three primary parameters: north or south directionality, angle of inclination or dip up or down, and intensity. Figure 1 illustrates how this works. The earth has north and south magnetic poles, which are close to, but not identical with, the north and south geographical poles. By convention, what is called the north pole of a magnet is the end that points towards the earth's North Magnetic Pole. Opposites attract, so the North Pole is actually a magnetic south pole, and the South Pole is actually a magnetic north pole. At the north magnetic pole, a magnet's north p ole will point straight down toward the magnetic pole. As the magnet moves toward the equator, it will continue to point upwards toward the North Mag- netic Pole at a decreasing angle, until it becomes hori-zontal near the equator. Then it will incline upwards unt il, at the South Magnetic Pole, it points straight up away from the pole. For thousands of years, human beings have used m agnetic compasses to navigate. In the mid-nineteenth century, evidence began to accumulate that many other creatures also use the magnetic eld to nd their way around. N North magnetic South magnetic pole S pole Magnetic equator Geographic equator Figure 1 219 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 Experiment 1 It is known that European robins migrate northward in the spring and southward in the fall. Caged robins that cannot join in the migration tend to gather at the side of the cage facing in the desired direction of migration. In this experiment, an articial magnetic eld is i ntroduced that shifts the magnetic north experienced by the caged birds. Figure 2a indicates the way the birds gather under the natural geomagnetic eld and Figures 2b and 2c indicate this under two articial magnetic elds. For each environment, the direction of magnetic north (mN) and the inclination are given. The dots indicate where each bird placed itself. The vector arrow drawn from the center of each circle indicates the direction and intensity of the birds' consensus on the direction of migration. Experiment 2 In this experiment, rather than changing the direc-tion of magnetic north, the birds are exposed to arti-cial magnetic elds with reversed inclinations by r eversing either the polarity or the direction of incli- nation. As illustrated in Figure 1, magnetic eld lines ar e roughly horizontal near the equator but incline downward toward the north in the northern hemi-sphere and upward toward the south in the southern he misphere. Figure 3 illustrates the experimental elds. This studies a spring migration of birds that remain in one hemisphere. Their pattern is to migrate toward the pole of their hemisphere where it will be cooler in summer. The two left-hand diagrams repre-sent magnetic elds as they exist in the northern and sou thern hemispheres. The two right-hand diagrams represent magnetic eld lines that occur only articially. mW mE mS mN 360\u00b0, 66\u00b0 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000- - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 N geographic north S geographic south p poleward e equatorward direction faced by birds the direction the north pole of a compass will point S N S N e p e pN S N S e p e p Natural Natural northern hemisphere southern hemisphere Figure 3 18.

The compass can point north, south, east, w est, or toward the points of the compass in between them. g. The inclination of the compass changes fr om pointing straight up at the south magnetic pole to horizontal and northward at the equator, to straight down at the north magnetic pole. h. The compass points north in the northern he misphere and south in the southern hemisphere. j. The geographical and geomagnetic North and S outh Poles are different. Artificial Artificial 19. What is the preferred migration direction of the robins shown in Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c and the apparent magnetic directions based on magnetic north? a.

Based on Figure 3, what magnetic eld inclina- tion and direction will induce robins to migrate no rthward in the springtime? f. downward and northward, upward and sou thward g. downward and northward, upward and no rthward h. downward and southward, upward and no rthward j. only downward and northward 21. Look at Figure 3. What is the same about both o f the magnetic elds in which the birds tend to migrate northward? a. The magnetic eld points to the north. b. The magnetic eld points downward. c. The slope of the magnetic eld is inclined d ownward toward the north in all cases where the birds migrate north. d. The magnetic eld inclines upward. 22. Examine Figure 3 in light of the model of the g eomagnetic eld presented in Figure 1. Which answer is the best statement of the difference in the polarity of the apparent geomagnetic elds represented in the rst and third diagrams? f. They are the same. g. In the rst (leftmost) diagram the apparent mag netic north is in the same direction as geographic north. In the third diagram the apparent magnetic polarity of the North and South Poles has been reversed so that a compass needle will point south, not north. The inclination is down toward the pole in both cases. h. The polarity is the same, but in the rst diag ram the eld lines incline upward and in the third they incline downward. j. The polarity in the rst diagram is reversed fr om the normal geomagnetic polarity illustrated in the third diagram. 23. Based on the report in this passage, including e xperiment 1 and experiment 2 and Figures 1, 2, and 3, which answer is the best summary of the implications of these experiments? a. Birds have an internal compass, operating o n the same principle as the ones that people use, to help them fly in the direction they want to. b. Birds seem to be influenced by magnetic e lds, but they are as likely to fly in the wrong direction as the right one when guided by magnetism. c. Experiment 1 seemed to demonstrate that b irds fly according to an internal compass, but experiment 2 disproved that. d. Birds are influenced by magnetic elds, but the y cannot distinguish north from south polarity. When it is time to migrate toward a pole, they tend to fly toward the direction in which magnetic eld lines dip. 222 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 Passage V\u2014Data Representation universal part of the aging process, but can be more Osteoporosis is a medical condition that involves the or less severe depending on various factors.

Early life was limited to prokaryotes (creatures that had no cellular nuclei) that processed sulfur, not oxygen, to gain energy. These early microbes are called bacteria and archaeans. Something happened to change this in the course of the 3 billion years ending about 400 million years ago. Earth now has an atmosphere consisting of 21% free oxygen, and there is enough oxygen dis-solved in the seas so that respiration of oxygen to p roduce energy is viewed as almost synonymous with being alive. The few remaining anaerobic (non-oxygen-breathing) bacteria and archaeans reside in deep, dark underground and underwater habitats. Two scientists present their understanding of ho w this occurred. 225 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 Scientist 1 About 2.5 billion years ago most existing species were kil led by exposure to a dangerous gas, oxygen. The oxygen was produced by a family of bacteria, cyano-bacteria, that used chlorophyll to free oxygen from water through the process of photosynthesis. Cyano-bacteria had existed for about 1 billion years before this Great Oxygen Catastrophe, but the oxygen they produced was absorbed by carbon, iron, and other substances. The catastrophe occurred when the pro- duction of free oxygen exceeded the ability of the ear th to absorb it. Anaerobic species largely died off, and oxygen-using (aerobic) species proliferated. This led to the development of eukaryotes (complex celled creatures) and large and complex species. Geological evidence, including patterns of iron o re formation, demonstrates that the Great Oxygen Catastrophe increased levels of atmospheric oxygen from virtually zero to about 15%. Through a combina- tion of gradual and not so gradual increases, this level r eached about 20% approximately 400 million years ago. Cyanobacteria are still a major type of bacteria. They form huge colonies in the ocean that have been misidentied as blue-green algae, and they live inside green plant cells, where they are called chloroplasts. Scientist 2 There was no so-called Great Oxygen Catastrophe. T he cyanobacteria slowly introduced oxygen into the oceans for about 1 billion years before oxygen levels reached the vicinity of 1%. At that point, approxi-mately 2.5 billion years ago, eukaryotes and the rst m ulticellular creatures began to develop. The iron deposits and other evidence my colleague points to can be explained by factors other than a huge leap in free oxygen. For about 2 billion years after the so-called G reat Oxygen Catastrophe, no creatures appeared in the sea that required more than 1% to 1.5% oxygen to survive. About 550 million years ago sh several centimeters in length and other species appeared that would have required oxygen concentrations of several percent. Then, approximately 400 million years ago, an expansion in new species types indicates a larger increase in oxygenation approaching our modern 21%. Fish species increased from several centimeters to a meter or more in length. On land, plants with complex water transport systems arose. 29. Which answer does NOT reflect Scientist 1's v iewpoint? a. Cyanobacteria introduced the rst sig nicant levels of free oxygen to the sea and the air. b. About 2.5 billion years ago, atmospheric o xygen levels rose from minimal trace levels to about 15%. c. Oxygen eliminated the anaerobic p rokaryotes and replaced them with eukaryotes. d. After the Great Oxygen Catastrophe, oxygen le vels continued to rise to modern levels. 30. Which statement best summarizes Scientist 2's diff erences with Scientist 1? f. The iron sediment record does not a ccurately reflect free oxygen levels. g. Until about 550 million years ago, increase in o xygen levels was gradual and remained under 1.5% concentration. Two events, one 550 million years ago and another 400 million years ago, not a catastrophe 2.5 billion years ago, brought free oxygen up to modern levels. h. Biological, not geological, data are the only r eliable record of free oxygen concentrations. j. Cyanobacteria played no signicant role in the d evelopment of free oxygen. The increasing size of sh species and the complexity of plant species on land caused the two major oxygenation events. 226 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 31. Which statement is a point on which Scientist 1 and 2 ag ree? a. Anaerobic prokaryotes began losing their d ominant role in biology approximately 2.5 billion years ago. b. Oxygen levels reached at least 10% 2.5 b illion years ago and have subsequently increased to 21%. c. Oxygen levels remained under 5% until 400 mil lion years ago. d. Cyanobacteria have now been replaced by p hotosynthetic plants. 32. Which of the following statements directly con-tradicts Scientist 2's hypothesis? f. Free oxygen was largely produced by p hotosynthesis, beginning with the cyanobacteria. g. More complex biological forms require hig her levels of oxygenation. h. Free oxygen levels in the atmosphere might ha ve been as high as 10% prior to 550 million years ago. j. none of the above 33. Which of the following statements directly con- tradicts Scientist 1's stated views? a. Archaean species became extinct in the G reat Oxygen Catastrophe. b.

With which statement have both Scientist 1 and Scie ntist 2 stated or implied their disagreement? f. Oxygen is a dangerous gas. g. Oxygen is absolutely essential to modern life. h. Increased oxygen levels play no role in b iological evolution. j. Complex life may be possible without o xygen. 35.

Here we will measure specic heat in joules/gram/\u00b0Celsius. The heat of fusion is the quantity of heat energy required to melt a given mass of a substance when it is at its melting temperature. We will measure the heat of fusion in joules/gram. A substance at its melting tem-perature maintains that temperature as heat is added t o it until it is completely melted.

ACT Mathematics Practice Test 3 Multiply 60 by the decimal equivalent of 95% (0.95). This is 60 \u00d7 0.95 = 57. The two integers that add up to 26 with the smallest product are 1 and 25. Distribute the 4, and then isolate the vari-able. C hange the equation into y = mx + b format, and b = 3. To nd the area of a parallelogram, multiply the base times the height. So, in this case, divide the area by the height to nd the base. 1 2First, 1 - 1 2 = . Then 2 3 of 1 is 2 6. 6 added to 1 is2 2 2 5 5 6, so of the collection is gone, and 1 6 6 remains. Break up 40 into factors of 4 and 10, and then remove the square root of 4. (3x + 5) 2 = (3x + 5)(3x + 5) = (9x2 + 215x + 15x + 25) = (9x2 + 30x + 25) = 9x 30x - 25. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180\u00b0, so 180 = 111 + 2x + x. Solving for x, x = 23 and 2x = 46. Substitute the given values into the equation and solve for h. Solve the rst equation for m, then substi- tute the value of m in 14m. Isolate the absolute value sign in |x + 7| 8 = 14, so |x + 7| = 22. Since |22| and |22| both equal 22, x + 7 can be 22 or 22, and x = 15 or x = 29. Thus, the solution set is {-29,15}. Find the equation of the line containing (2,3) and (6,1).

The height of the triangle is therefore 12, and the base is 5, so the area, found by 1bh, is 30. The f [g(x)] = f (2x 1), so replace every x in f (x) with (2x 1). f [g(x)] = 3(2x 1) + 2, or f [ g(x)] = 6x 3 + 2, and nally f[g(x)] = 6x - 1. The expression log464 means 4? = 64; 43 = 64. Therefore, log464 = 3. (x - 5) must equal (x + 2) or -(x + 2). The two former terms cannot be equal, and x = 1.5 satises the second possibility. U sing the formula for circumference = 2Ur, where r is the radius, nd that the radius = 28.Now use the formula for area = Ur , or a = 64U, which is approximately 200. The slope of the given line is -2.5. Since par - allel lines have the same slope, the slope is also -2.5, or - 5.2 Because the triangle is a 30-60-90 right tri - angle, the hypotenuse is twice the shorter le g, and the longer leg is therefore x 3 . The perimeter is 3x + x 3, and when set equal to 30 + 10 3, x must be 10. The total cost is represented by (cost per week)(# of weeks) + (cost per magazine)(# of magazines). The length of one edge of cube Y is 1 of 15, 5 or 3. The volume of a cube is s3, where s = length of one edge, so the volume is 27 cubic inches. The gure created by all points 10 units from any single given point on the y-axis is a circle; thus the gure created using all the points on the y-axis would be a cylinder. While the % increase is found by change in price \u00f7 original price, % of original is found by new price \u00f7 original price. 1.2 1.4Set up a proportion where 200 = x .

S ince the shortened sides of the rectangle are 9 and 12, the two legs of the right triangle must be 4 and 3. Thus the hypotenuse of that triangle is 5, and when added to the other sides of the polygon, the perimeter is 54. 29. b. Fir st, WZ - WY = YZ , so YZ = XY , so XY = 6. 30. k.

Use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the hypot-enuse, which is the distance in question. 36. f. y 2 is a common factor of the two terms, so if y were any given value greater than 3, the square of that value would become the greatest common factor of the two terms. 37. d. S ince the distance, 17.5, is 5 times as much as 3.5, the time will likewise be 5 times greater. 38. g. A ny line parallel to the x-axis is also a hori- zontal line, and all horizontal lines have a slo pe of 0. 39. d. Three factors assure that the result will be even: raising the value to an even integer, multiplying the resulting value by an even integer, and adding an even integer to that total. 40. f. Plug in values to start, such as 20 and 5, for the length and width. The perimeter of this rectangle would be 50. If the lengths are tri- pled, to 60 and 15, the perimeter would be likewise tripled, to 150. 41. e. Trial and error, which should logically start with the largest answer, reveals that 144 and 160 are multiples of 16, so no multiple of 16 is found between 145 and 159. 42. k. Since the bases of a trapezoid are parallel, angle DCA is an alternate interior angle to angle BAC , and therefore also has a measure of 35\u00b0. Angle DCE is a straight angle, and therefore measures 180\u00b0; thus angle ACB must measure 35\u00b0 (180\u00b0 - 110\u00b0 - 35\u00b0). 43. c. The average of any odd number of consecu-tive integers is also the median, so the sum of the least and greatest will be the same as the double of the average. 44. j.

The maximum value for the sine func- tion is 1, which occurs at 90o, or 2 U, and then every 360\u00b0 the reafter. So the minimum posi - tive value for 2x is 2 U, and the minimum posi- Utive value for x is 4. 58. j. S ince the radius is 15, the area of the circle is (15)2U, or 225U. The central angle is 120\u00b0, or one-third of the circle, so the sector area is the equivalent portion of the circle, or one-third of 225U, which is 75U. 59. d.

I n the rst few lines, the narrator states that Miss Temple was the superintendent of the seminary and that the narrator received both instruction and friendship from Miss Temple, who was also like a mother to her\u2014she had stood me in the stead of mother. 12. g. C ombined with the earlier use of usually, the word appeared conveys a temporary state\u2014 in this case, of being disciplined and sub- dued. When Miss Temple departs, the nar rator is left in her natural element, and she feels the stirring of old emotions, thus afrming the earlier implication. 13. a. T he narrator states that with Miss Temple, I had given in allegiance to duty and order; I w as quiet; I believed I was content (lines 18-20). 14. h. T he context here suggests existence or habi- tation, not captivity or illness. 15. c. W e can assume that the narrator would go home during vacations, but she spent all of her vacations at school because Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead (lines 74-75). Thus we can infer that Mrs. Reed was her guardian, the one who sent the nar - rator to Lowood in the rst place. 16. g. T he narrator describes her experience with school-rules and school-duties (line 78) and how she tired of the routine (line 83) after Miss Temple left, and describes a view from her window that seemed a prison ground, exile limits (lines 64-65). Thus it can be inferred that Lowood is both a structured and an isolated place. 17. a. T he narrator states in lines 51-54 that she remembered that the real world was wide, and . . . awaited those who had courage to go forth.

All of these columns have the same value regardless of the type of snow. FS is a feature of the tow rope mechanism and is always the same. The experiment was designed to test the same mass in each case. According to the formulas given, F G = mass(10.0 m/s2) and FI = FG[sin(V)]. 2. f. The description of experiment 1 explains that F T is recorded by the towing device. FF can be calculated based on formula 6. FNET = 0 because the velocity is constant. T hen, FF = (FT + FI + FS). The coefcient of friction (\u00b5) is calculated from formula 4 by rearrang-ing it and substituting F G[cos(V)] (formula 2) for FP. All of the other values are either predetermined by the experiment's design or derived from the predetermined values. 3. a. The only force not determined by the system design specications is FF. According to for - mula 2, the largest value of \u00b5 produces the largest F F. If the system can handle the larg- est force necessary, it can handle the smaller ones. Do not be confused by the question calling this the minimum force required. The least this system is designed to do is to adequately handle the highest force require- ments of the design specication. 4. h. The explanation for formula 3 says that FG is given in newtons. All of the forces are derived from F G and FS. FS is also given in newtons. 5. b. A s formulas 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 illustrate, all of the forces involved, except for FS, are directly pro - portional to the mass of the skiers. The mass i n experiment 2 is exactly 10 times the mass in experiment 1, so FI + FF can be calculated by multiplying the Table 1 values for powder by 10. F S is always 5,000 N , regardless of the mass of the skiers. Answer choice a will give the cor - rect result, but it is not the easiest way to do t hat because it involves recalculating values already calculated for Table 1. Answer choices c and d mistakenly multiply F T by 10, even though its FS component does not increase with the mass of the skiers. Answer choice d makes the additional mistake of averaging the three Table 1 results instead of taking the one involving the largest F T. The concern of this experiment is not to nd the average force but the greatest force required. 6. j. F = ma. The mass is 4,200 kg, and the accel- eration required is 0.5 m/s. The result is 2,400 kg m/s. That is the same as 2,400 N. Answer choice f does not multiply the mass by the acceleration. Answer choices h and g multiply by sin(V) and cos(V). Sin(V) and cos(V) are used to divide a force or other vector into two perpendicular components. In this case, the force applied is in the same direction as the acceleration required, so it is not divided into components. Passage II\u2014Data Representation 7. b.

Answer choice j is true, but it would be moving in opposite directions, but describes the Hill reaction, not an aspect of the cumulative height would be above mean it being tested by these experiments. sea level. 241 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 13. a. C arbon dioxide is one of the most impor - tant compounds involved in photosynthesis, and g lucose, which contains carbon, is one of its most important products. Answer choices c and d are not correct, because hydrogen and oxygen occur as inputs and products in both reactions. Answer choice b is not correct for two reasons: A is part of the Hill reaction, which is a stage in the pro- cess of photosynthesis, so it is present in p hotosynthesis; less importantly, it is not an element. Neither ADP , the A normally involved in photosynthesis, nor DCPIP , the A used in these experiments, is an element. 14. j. T his and many other experiments have dem- onstrated that light and chloroplasts are nec-essary conditions for photosynthesis, but the r ole they play is to aid the reactions, rather than become incorporated as part of the results. 15. c. T rial 1-C involves no chloroplasts, and 2-A involves no light. In each case, there is virtu- ally no change in the color of the DCPIP . T he passage warns that these results lack precision, so no signicance should be attached to small differences. As explained in the passage, it was necessary to allow some light in during trial 2-A to get the colorime-ter reading. It is after that that the DCPIP fa des slightly. Answer choice d is not correct because the release of oxygen from water is very important. 16. f. T he difference between high and low chloro- plast concentration (trials 1-A and 1-B) and hig h and low light (trials 2-B and 2-C) is very similar. The DCPIP fades more rapidly in the trials with more light or more chloro- plasts but levels off at a color intensity very c lose to that achieved by the trials with less light or lower chloroplast concentration. Answer choice g is not correct. The passage warns that DCPIP does not give precise results. The difference between the results in trials 1-A and 2-C does not warrant making any distinction between the impact of chlo-roplasts and light, and answer choice j does. T here is no means presented in the passage to compare concentrations of chloroplasts to intensities of light in any case. 17. c. T he passage says that DCPIP is blue in its normal oxidized form but loses its color when it loses its oxygen. Answer choice d is tricky because it is true that DCPIP gives up its oxygen to combine with hydrogen, but it is the loss of oxygen, regardless of the sur - rounding events, that is identied as the cause o f DCPIP's loss of color. Passage IV\u2014Research Summary 18. g. U nderstanding experiments 1 and 2 depends on understanding the relationship between compass direction and inclination, and that is what Figure 1 illustrates. Answer choice h is not true. The north pole of a compass will always point toward the North Magnetic Pole, which is a magnetic south pole. Answer choice f is a popular view of how a compass is used, but it is not accurate. The compass needle always points northward. Answer choice j is a true statement but of little importance in these experiments. It is important always to answer the question asked. The best answer is usually true, but not every true statement is a good answer. 242 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 19. a. Figur e 2a has magnetic north pointed upward in the usual manner. The vector arrow points slightly to the right or east. Fig-ure 2b has its articial magnetic north p ointing southeast. The vector arrow points slightly to its left or west. Figure 2c has its magnetic north pointing west. Its vector arrow points to its right or east. Answer choice b treats the gures as if magnetic north pointed up in all of them. Answer choice c gives the answer that is the strongest conrmation of the experimental results, but it is not accurate. Answer choice d con - fuses left and right (west and east) for Fig-ures 2b and 2c. 20. f. T he leftmost and rightmost diagrams in g- ure 3 are the only ones in which the birds p oint north. The magnetic eld arrow points down and to the north in the rst diagram and up and to the south in the last diagram. 21. c. T he magnetic eld arrows are parallel in the two diagrams in which the birds migrate northward. They are lower in the north and higher in the south, but their magnetic polarities are in opposite directions. 22. g. 23. d. In the rst diagram, the magnetic north ar row points toward geographic N, but in the third it points toward geographic S. In both diagrams the magnetic north arrow points toward the pole (the North Pole and the South Pole, respectively). The point of this experiment is to show that the birds respond to the magnetic inclination or dip, not the polarity. In either hemisphere, they \"know\" that the magnetic lines go down toward the pole, but they cannot distinguish a north magnetic pole from a south mag- netic pole. Answer choice h reverses the inc lination of the two. Answer choice j reverses the polarity by stating that the third diagram represents normal polarity. In fact, it shows magnetic north pointing to the geo-graphic south, which is not the way the geo-magnetic eld works. I t is actually less puzzling than it seems. After all, people distinguish polarity of a magnet only if it is marked or it is placed close enough to be attracted or repelled by one that is marked. We do know, however, when something is attracted by a magnet. Answer choice a is wrong because humans generally use compasses to determine direc- tion based on polarity. When inclination is meas ured it is almost always for geodetic purposes, not direction nding. Answer choice b is wrong because it was only when birds were deliberately misled by the experi-mental conditions that they made the wrong d ecision on direction. Answer choice c is also wrong. Experiment 2 proves that birds do not distinguish the polarity of a magnet, but it shows that they do follow magnetic elds by, in some way, sensing their inclina-tion. 243 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 Passage V\u2014Data Representation 24. h. T he high point on the curve occurs between 30 and 40 for both males and females. 25. a. W ith this kind of question it is important to look at all elements of each answer. Answer choice a's description is correct in every-thing said. The one thing it says nothing ab out, the different pattern of spinal fracture rates, is not highly signicant because the differences are relatively small, and the rates end up at about the same level. Answer choices b, c, and d each contain actual errors. None of them indicate, as answer choice a does, that males experience no sig-nicant wrist fracture increases. Answer c hoice b says they are similar except that the wrist and spinal fracture rates are signi-cantly higher. This is only partly true of the spinal r ates, and it ignores the female hip fracture rate, which is the most dramatic dif-ference on the chart. Answer choice d says nothing ab out the difference in wrist frac- ture rates. 26. h. A nswer choice h points to the need for closer study. One subject per time period is not adequate data on which to base the con- clusions of answer choice f or g. Answer c hoice j is irresponsibly incorrect. A loss of 4% bone density in 80 days is signicant in itself. For trips of six months to years, a loss at that rate would mean the danger of frac-tures is signicantly increased. 27. b. T he signicance of data is based on its importance in developing new knowledge or pinpointing areas where more attention is required. Bones break according to their individual density, not the average density of all bones in the body. The correct answer choice is b because that is the most marked indication of a problem. Answer choices a and c point to auxiliary data. The total body average is derived from the other data. It is apparently relatively low due to the insigni- cant loss (four parts per thousand) in the ar ms. Answer choice d refers to a signicant loss but not as signicant a loss as the tro- chanter's. 28. h. L oss per month would provide a picture of how bone mass changes over time. Averages by age and sex would be less signicant additions, although monthly details divided in that way would be more interesting. We know that most cosmonauts are younger than the age at which signicant bone loss begins in either males or females. Relative weight of each bone type is readily available outside this study, but the level of risk and the signicance of risk to each bone type do not depend on the relative mass of each type in the body. Passage VI\u2014Conflicting Viewpoints 29. c. Scie ntist 1 did not say anaerobic prokaryotes were eliminated and replaced with eukary- otes. He said that most anaerobic prokaryote sp ecies were eliminated, and they were replaced with aerobic prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes and more complex species. 244 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 30. g. A nswer choice g correctly states Scientist 2's overall view of the rise in oxygen levels. Answer choice f accurately reflects one of her statements but says nothing about the hypothesis that that statement supports. She does rely on the biological record, but she does not make a blanket statement like that of answer choice h. She also never makes a statement like that of answer choice j. She points to the increasing size and complexity of species as evidence that oxygen levels had increased, not as the cause of that increase. 31. a. Scie ntist 1 says that the great catastrophe killed off most anaerobic prokaryotes 2.5 billion years ago. Scientist 2 says that the eukaryotes and other complex creatures expanded their role at that time. They dis-agree on the rapidity of the change at that t ime, but they agree, as the passage says most scientists do, that the anaerobic prokaryotes lost their virtual monopoly on life beginning at that time. Scientist 2 is not specic about what oxygenation levels were 2.5 billion years ago, but she disagrees with answer choice b's statement that they were at least 10%. Scientist 1 explicitly disagrees with answer choices c and d. 32. j. A nswer choices f and g are explicitly sup- ported by Scientist 2. Answer choice h may se em to contradict her views, but a careful reading reveals that she said there was no evidence of oxygen levels above several per - cent; she does not put a denite upper limit o n the level as of 550 million years ago. Her hypothesis is that the increase was gradual, with no sudden catastrophe, until a sharp increase 550 million years ago. That leaves 2 billion years for a gradual increase from 0% to 10%. 33. b. 34. h. 35. d. Scientist 1 explicitly points to the important c ontinuing role of cyanobacteria, both in the form of blue-green algae and as cytoplasts, in photosynthesis. Answer choice a is not true and is not a part of his theory, but it is not in direct disagreement with his reported statements. Answer choice c is a key part of Scientist 2's idea, but Scientist 1 never denies that oxygen levels continued to increase after the catastrophe of 2.5 billion years ago. Some kind of marked increase at the times specied by Scientist 2 does not contradict Scientist 1's theory. With these questions it is important to keep in mind that if there is no \"none of the above\" or \"all of the above\" answer, there must be one best answer. Answer choice h is clearly something that both scientists dis- agree with. Scientist 1 says most known spe- cies were eliminated by oxygen, and Scientist 2 sa ys oxygen was necessary for the develop- ment of more complex species. There is nothing r eported indicating that either sci- entist disagrees with answer choice f, althoug h we probably all do. Scientist 1, in fact, made an ironic statement of agreement with answer choice f. They both implicitly support answer choice g. They say nothing about answer choice j. This question calls on the test taker to see how people with contradictory viewpoints may have overlapping positions. Views that conflict about part of a process may reach consensus about other parts. 245 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 Passage VII\u2014Data Representation 36. f. The specic heat for solid A is 3 J/g/\u00b0C, and the melting point is 1,000\u00b0C. One gram must be raised 500\u00b0 at 3 J/g/\u00b0C. The answer is 3 \u00d7 500 or 1,500 J. 37. d. The melting point appears as a horizontal (constant temperature) line in Figure 2 at -20\u00b0C. Substance D is the only one in Table 1 with that melting point. 38. h. This can be calculated by using either the heating formula on the heating segment of the graph or the melting formula on the melting segment. The melting formula is the simplest, so substitute the values shown in Figure 2 and Table 1 into the melting for - mula: J M = HF \u00d7 m 400 J = 40 J/g \u00d7 m m = 10g 39. b. First 10 grams of substance B must be raised from 1,000\u00b0C to its melting point, 1,200\u00b0C. By the formula J H = )T \u00d7 m: JH = 200\u00b0C \u00d7 5 J/g/\u00b0C \u00d7 10 g = 10,000 J Then the 10 grams has to be melted. Using JM = HF \u00d7 m: JM = 6.0 J/g \u00d7 10 g = 60 J Adding the two gives us 10,060 J. 40. f. The heat required to melt a substance is shown in the HF (heat of fusion) column of Table 1. It is 8 for substance C and 40 for 8substance D; 40 = 5 1 or 1:5. ACT Writing Practice Test 3 Sample \"Score 6\" Essay When the founding fathers of ourConstitution included the Bill of Rights, they wanted to guaranteeAmerican citizens the right to freespeech. Although freedom of speechis a valuable right of all American cit-izens, it has been abused by thosewho are manipulating the Constitutionand its writers' intent so that theymay gain fame, wealth, or attention.The only way to amend this problemis to impose censorship on theseabusers. Unfortunately, the Internethas become a hotbed of abuse of free speech and needs to be censored,especially in our schools so thatstudents are protected, educationcontinues, and the authors of the offensive websites will eventuallyshut down their sites. Use of the Internet in school has skyrocketed in the past fewyears. It has opened a door to anaspect of education never dreamed ofbefore. Students and teachers can use the Internet for research, dem- onstration, and to learn and practice new skills. +owever, these benefits can occur only when the Internet isused wisely. Of all the websites avail-able through the World Wide Web,only a small percentage is reallyworthwhile. Many others simply usethe Web to exercise their warped ver-sion of free speech. Students mustbe protected from this abuse. Somestudents who are curious purposelygo to questionable Web sites. Once there they find it difficult to turn away. As humans, we have a natural 246 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 inclination toward the bizarre and even salacious. That's why it's up toschools to protect their studentsfrom themselves\u2014and their natural curiosity\u2014by imposing restrictions onthe Internet. Other students inno-cently type a word into a searchengine and are directed to an offensiveWeb site. It is well known that cer- tain violent and sexual images become imprinted on the brain and are nearlyimpossible to eradicate. Again,schools should protect their stu-dents from exposure to a potentiallong-lasting horror. Another reason schools should have tight control over the Internet isto ensure that education continues uninterrupted. It's too easy tobecome sidetracked by intriguing, butunhealthy, Web sites and games. Yes,people should exercise some self-control, but if the school is in the business of education, it should make sure that all of its accoutrements enhance education, not distract from it. It's a waste of time and energy forschool administrators to try to huntdown Internet abusers. That time and energy can be saved if the school hasonly an intranet with preapprovedsites. Schools should be educatingstudents, not policing them. Finally, if more schools make the decision to curb Internet access, maybe the people who create theseoffensive sites will be shut down. Most of these people make money offadvertising on their Web sites. Theypromise advertisers that many peopleview their Web sites. If a large percentage of computer users weresuddenly not included in that calcula-tion, maybe these abusers would findbetter uses of their time and talents. An intranet is a great solution to t he problem of Internet abuse. It allows students quick and easy access to preapproved, educational material. But it protects students from people who do not really understand the idea behind freedom of speech. \"Censor- ship\" is not a dirty word; it is a way t o ensure that people do not abuse the right of free speech and make life more difficult for others. Critique This essay shows an excellent understanding of the assig nment. It includes interesting ideas and insight- ful treatment of personal observations in connection w ith the assignment. The thesis statement is strong and clear. The essay contains strong supporting details that are well developed and explained throughout the essay, including three strong and logi- cal reasons for the establishment of an intranet in the sc hool. The essay is well organized with paragraphs appropriately broken out and good transitions between ideas. It remains focused and on topic throughout. The language used is highly sophisti-cated, and the essay contains few, if any, spelling, g rammar, or capitalization errors. Sample \"Score 5\" Essay Members of the community are con-sidering limiting Internet access in the schools. They believe that young peo-ple are at risk of being exposed to i nappropriate material on the Internet. I disagree with this proposal for a variety of reasons. 247 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 The Internet contains a wealth of information for students. It is a valuable educational and resource tool. By using the Internet studentscan \"visit\" great places like museumsand government offices. 6tudents canget the very latest, up-to-date infor-mation on science, health, and world events. To cut students off from this wealth would be a great disser-vice to them. While it's true that many Web sites are offensive andinappropriate, most are not. Weshould not \"throw out the babywith the bathwater\" by completelyeliminating student access to theWorld Wide Web. There are some students who purposely investigate questionableW eb sites. These students are usually just curious or they may be chronicoffenders who need to be dealt with. +owever, it would be very easy to fig-ure out who these students are and limit their access to the Internet. If every student had his or her ownpassword and login name, this problemwould be eliminated. We shouldn't punish all students for the actionsof a few. Censoring the entire Inter- net from all students just because a few can't control themselves is a vio-lation of the students' rights. I think an intranet will be too limiting to be useful to students. Itwill take too much time and effort to research websites and then uploadthem one by one once they haveapproval. Plus doing this will causeall students doing research to havethe same information from the same source. We might as well just all copy off one another and then therewould be even more trouble! The point is, what's the use of doingresearch if we're all going to look inexactly the same place for informa-tion? The idea behind research is to find new, interesting ideas and information. Replacing the Internet with an intranet is a bad idea. It will be too limiting and cumbersome and there arebetter ways to deal with the problemof inappropriate websites. Critique This essay shows a good understanding of the prompt and offers some specic arguments to support the idea that an intranet should not replace the Internet. The indirect thesis statement is a bit weak, but it clearly states the writer's point of view. The essay uses logical arguments and contains counterarguments in paragraphs 2 and 3. The essay shows a good com-mand of written language but lacks the style and so phistication of a sample score 6 essay. Sample \"Score 4\" Essay C ensorship is when anything that is considered offensive or harmful is limited so that people cannot have access to it. For some people that includes many things from realistic video games to certain types of music. I think censorship is not a good idea in America because that's part of what we fought for\u2014free- dom. Many people think the Internet s hould be under censorship, but I don't agree. Because it was invented, the Internet has been a great thing for many people. I enjoy doing research for school on it. There are many Web 248 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 sites that have great information on them. I especially like to go on Web sites that deal with science and health. But some people think the Internet should be censored. They think students will go on Internet sites that are violent or have improper content on them. Its true that some students may go to these sites. But most students don't. Also, if you censor the Internet who will decide what gets censored and what doesn't. There are things on the Internet that are fi ne for older students but not for younger ones. The problem with censorship is that it means different things to everybody. I don't think there shouldbe pornography or super violent stuffon the Internet. But I do think some stuff is ok even if it may have somequestionable things on it. For example,a health website may have a picture ordrawing of a naked person, but that'snot pornography. Or a website aboutwar may have violent images on it, butthat's what war is about, and youcan't really censor it or you don'thave the truth. I think that everyone needs to decide what is a problem for them-selves and censor his own Internet i nstead of having the school do it. This will help teach students responsibility and make it so that all students don't have to pay for the actions of a few. Make students sign an agreement that they will not abuse the Internet at the school. A good compromise might be to block some obviously non-educational Web sites. Critique This essay shows a good understanding of the assign-ment. The writer takes a clear stand on the issue even thoug h the thesis statement is a bit weak and unde- veloped. This essay is well organized overall with so me specic examples, but again, it lacks some development. The essay shows an adequate command of written language but lacks sophistication in vocab-ulary use and sentence structure and contains a few g rammatical and spelling errors. Sample \"Score 3\" Essay The school board is thinking aboutcutting off the Internet and going toan intranet at the school. I think this is probably a good idea. A lot of students waste time on the school computers. They say theirdoing research but their really justfooling around. They may not be play- ing games or anything, but they go to websites that have pretty much noth-ing to do with school or anythingeducational. If we had an intranet we could still use the computers for researchand stuff but it would be for stu-dents who are serious about it, not students who just want to wastetime. Anyone who wanted to do moreresearch outside of school could do it at home or at the public library. School is a place for learning and not fooling around on the Internet allday. The intranet would avoid thisproblem and make it so that real stu- dents could do their work and the people who don't really want to usethe computer seriously will think it'sboring and not take up all the computers. 249 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 3 Critique This essay shows an adequate understanding of the assig nment. The thesis statement is a bit weak: I think this is probably a good idea. The rest of the essay, how- ever, supports the thesis with some logical arguments. T he essay would have been stronger with better orga- nization and better development using specic exam-ples. It shows some command of written language b ut contains some simplistic sentences with simple vocabulary and some awkward sentences. There are some spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, but they do not make the composition very difcult to read or understand. Sample \"Score 2\" Essay Censoring the Internet at school is just another way for the school tocontrol us. The school doesn't want people going on the Internet and seeinga bunch of stuff that they think isbad for us. The problem is that the school thinks it knows everything about howto get us to learn things. They don'trealize that the Internet is probablythe most used thing that studentshave to learn. A lot of students who don't really learn that much in classbecause the books and teachers are boring will learn more on the Internet. So what if sometimes you see something that's supposebly notappropriate. Who cares. Its not likeits really anything new, most peoplesee all that junk on tv anyway. Leave the Internet in the schools, it's the best thing aboutthem, I probably wouldn't even go ifwe didn't have computers. Critique This essay shows a very weak understanding of the p rompt. The writer does take a stand on the issue, but the support for it is weak and repetitive. The introduction does not contain a thesis statement at all. The essay drifts a bit off track by focusing on how students learn more from the Internet than from books and teachers. It is undeveloped and shows a weak command of written language, as evidenced by the grammatical and spelling errors. Sample \"Score 1\" Essay Censorship is when peple wont let you see or watch things that theythink are bad for you. Like the Inter-net, the school doesn't want us to have the Internet cause people arelooking at things that they shouldn'tbe. It really doesn't matter to mewhat the school does with the com- puters cause i have one at home I use and I can just go on that one anddo stuff. Most students have the same thing, so the school proballyshouldn't even bother doing anythingcause the students will just go onthe sites at home anyways. Critique This essay shows a lack of understanding with regard t o the assignment. The student shows some under - standing about censorship, but does not take a clear stand on the issue in the prompt and does not develop the essay with specic examples. The essay drifts off topic by repeatedly stating that students can use the Internet at home. The essay is poorly devel- oped and lacks a logical form of organization. The languag e used shows a serious lack of command of written language, and there are numerous spelling, grammar, punctuation, and capitalization errors. 250 CHAPTER5 ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 This is the nal practice ACT in this book.

Passage I\u2014The Art of Lawn Tennis This passage is taken from The Art of Lawn Tennis, by William Tatem Tilden. Tennis is at once an art and a science. The game as pla yed by such men as Norman E. Brookes and R.N. Williams is1 art. Yet like all true art, they have their basis2 in scientic methods that must be learned and learned thoroughly for a foundation before the artistic structure of a great tennis game can be constructed. Every player who hopes to attain a high d egree of efciency should of had3 a clearly dened method of development and adhere to it. He should be certain that it is based around 4 sound principles and, once assured of that, fol- low it, even though his progress seems slow and disc ouraging. I began tennis wrong .5 My strokes were wrong and my viewpoint clouded. I did not have early training just like 6 many of our American boys have at the present time. No one told me the importance of the fundamen- tals of the game, such as keeping the7 eye on the ball or correct body position and footwork. A r acquet was given to me to hit the ball.8 Natu- rally, like all beginners, I acquired many very se rious faults. I went along with moderate suc- cess until I graduated from school, beating so me fairly good players, but losing some matches to men below my class. The year fol-lowing my graduation the new captain of my alma mat er's team asked me if I would aid him in developing the squad for next year. Well, \"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,\" so I said Yes. 9 At that point my tennis education began. (1) Our tennis squad, comprising10 over a dozen youngsters, all knew me well and felt at perfect liberty to ask me as many questions as they could think up. (2) Frankly, I did not know, but I answered them something at the moment and said to myself it was time I learned some fundamentals of tennis. (3) I was seized 11 with requests to explain why Jones missed a forehand drive down the sideline, or Smith couldn't serve well, or Brown failed to hit the ball at all. (4) So I began to study 12 the rea- sons why certain shots are missed and others ma de, why certain balls are hit so much faster though with less effort than others, and why some players are great while most are only good. (5) I am still studying, but my results to date have resulted in a denite system to be learned, and it is this which I hope to explain to you. Tennis has a language all its own. The idi- oms of the game need to be learned, as all b ooks on the game are written in tennis par - lance. The technical terms and their counter - parts in slang need to be understood to tho roughly grasp the idea in any written tennis account. I do not believe in wasting time by carefully dening each rule of the game or 257 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 examining each blade of grass on a court. It gets y ou nowhere.13 I do, however, advocate teach- ing the terms of the game. 1. a. NO CHANGE b. game as played, by such men as Norman E. B rookes and R.N.

Passage II\u2014The Geography and Geology of Hartford, Connecticut This passage is taken from Historic Towns of the Con- necticut River Valley, by George S. Roberts. The rugged hills that compose the western, and, in lesse r degree, the eastern areas, are16 formed of rocks resembling in many respects the group to which granite belongs\u2014rocks that are very ancient, dating far back into the early history of the world. The rivers that flow among these hills have open valleys, showing that the por - tion of the land above the sea level has been p ractically unchanged for ages. But in the cen- tral portion of the state these ancient highlands sink 17 down into a broad trough running from Long Island Sound far up in to Massachusetts, and this trough is lled with rocks of much later date\u2014who's 18 history is one of the most interesting to be found in the great book of nature. Long before man lived upon the earth, w hen huge reptiles, long since utterly passed away, clambered over the hills or roamed along the muddy shores, the trough by a great lake or arm of the sea was lled. 19 Into its quiet waters ran streams from the surrounding hills, bring- ing down into the lake mud and sand from the land over which they flowed. These sank to the b ottom and there formed beds of sand and clay. Then a strange thing happened. Somewhere in this region, which is now so peaceful, a volcano bursted 20 forth and rolled floods of molten lava over the whole area. This lava turned much of the wat er in the lake to steam,21 and, spreading itself over the beds of land-waste at the bottom, there cooled and hardened into rock. Three times more has the lake lain in the trough, its bottom covered by beds of clay and sand, and three times has the lava overflowed the region, for we nd now in central Connecticut three great sheets of volcanic \"trap,\" as the rock is called, lying one above each other . 22 Each one resting23 on beds of clay, sand, or pebbles, now hardened into rocks known respectively as shale, sandstone, and conglomerate. Now, how can we see these three layers of la va, if they lie one above another? How is it that we can see more than the top of one, even if we should nd that there is no land-waste on top of that? It is in some way such as this, long aft er24 the last lava had hardened, the region was greatly disturbed and everything was tilted, so that the sheets of lava and the rocks lying between them, instead of lying horizontal, sloped strongly to the east. Since then there has been great wearing away 25 of the land caused by the weathering of the rocks, and the streams have carried away the land-waste to the sea. But the t rap26 is much harder than the sandstone and shale, so that it stands up above the coun-try in high ridges running north and south. At the t ime, the rocks were tilted they were also largely broken so vast fragments27\u2014miles in length\u2014have been separated from each other in different parts of central Connecticut. But for all this, the geologist nds plainly that these fragments belong to three different sheets of lava, which marks three 28 different periods of volcanic action. 259 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 The second volcanic eruption was appar - ently the greater one,29 for it left a sheet of lava that is in some places 500 feet thick. It is the upturned edge of this great sheet that forms the various so-called mountains of central Con- necticut. Perhaps the most remarkable remains o f life, those which are certainly the most famous, are the so-called Connecticut River Bird Tracks. These are footmarks left in the mud of the ancient shores by the creatures that roamed over them long ago. They are found in v arious places, but probably the most famous localities are Turner's Falls, in Massachusetts, and the great sandstone quarries at Portland, Connecticut. But the footmarks remain intact to the present time, even though the mud has lo ng since hardened into shale.30 16. f.

Passage III\u2014The Wonderful Magnet By Arthur Brisbane. Everybody knows something of the peculiari- ties of the magnet. As a boy you led tiny painted d ucks through31 the water basin, holding a magnet in your hand, or you owned a horse-shoe magnet that would pick up nails and nee-dles. You now know in a general kind of way that the mag net is a very useful, as well as a so mewhat mysterious thing .32 The old Greeks and Romans simply knew that some remark- able iron ore found in Lydia, near the town of M agnesia, and hence called magnet, was capa- ble of drawing and holding pieces of metal. A ncient cultures had the wildest theories con- cerning the magnet, just as we have wild theo-ries about things that are new and strange to us t oday. They thought that the magnet could be used in cases of sickness, could attract wood and flesh, and influences 33 the human brain, causing melancholy. They believed that the power of a magnet could be destroyed by rub-bing garlic on it, and that the power could be b rought back again by dipping the magnet in goat's blood. They believed that a magnet could be used to detect bad conduct in a woman; b elieved34 that it would not attract iron in the presence of a diamond. They believed as much othe r nonsense quite as ridiculous as the non- sense that we believe today.35 The magnet was rst made actually and wonderfully useful in the compass. Who dis- covered the compass nobody knows.36 It was probably invented by the Chinese and brought to Europe through the Arabs. Anyhow, some genius found out that a small needle brought in contact with the so-called lodestone, or mag- netic ore, absorbs the qualities of the lodestone, and w hen placed on a pivot will always point to the north. 261 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 (1) There were and still are many myster - ies around the magnet.37 (2) A form of perpet- ual motion seems to be embodied in the p rinciple of magnetism. (3) One strange fact is this; that38 the weight of the metal is exactly the same before it is magnetized and after it is mag-netized. (4) Early students 39 thought that the magnet pointed toward some particular spot in the sky, perhaps some magnetic star. (5) This suggestion was followed by ingenious yarns to the effect that in the extreme North ships had to be built with wooden nails, instead of iron nails, as the magnetic mountains would draw the iron nails out of the ship . 40 (6) One genius felt sure that there must be huge mountains of lodestone near the North Pole. (7) After this came the more rational conception that our own earth is a great magnet, and that the little magnet in the compass simply obeys in point-ing according to the greater force of the earth mag net. This essay is brought about by an incident t elegraphed from Vallejo, California. John Gettegg, apprentice in the Navy Yard, had in his cheek embedded a flying piece of steel.41 To get it out would apparently have demanded a pain-ful and difcult surgical operation, as the piece o f steel had entered the bone. The head electri- cian, however, simply near the wounded boy's fa ce placed an electromagnet capable of lifting 500 pounds,42 and the sharp piece of steel instantly flew out of the cheek and attached itself to the magnet. (1) In the great steelworks where armor plat e is made, powerful magnets are used to carry the hot plates from one place to another. (2) The magnet lifts up the hot, soft metal w ithout denting it or damaging it and drops it down where it is wanted. (3) The power that moves trolley cars through the streets is noth-ing in reality but an application of the force of the mag netic principle. (4) That the earth itself is a great magnet cannot be questioned. (5) And there is no doubt that each of us h uman beings is a compound magnet on his own account, depending for his welfare on magnetic force. (6) The millions of red corpus-cles in the blood, each with its innitesimal par ticles of iron, absorb in43 the lungs and dis- tribute throughout the body the electric forces o n which we depend, and with which we do our work. (7) When you read of men and women dealing in a blundering kind of a way with abstract, obtuse 44 speculations and prob- lems, do not laugh at them too heartily. (8) And the ir wild theories of today may settle down into great utility centuries from now. (9) They are no more ridiculous than the old Greeks who thought that a magnet could be regulated by garlic or goat's blood. 31. a. NO CHANGE b. over c. within d. around 32. f.

Passage IV\u2014The Soul of the Far East This passage is taken from The Soul of the Far East, by Percival Lowell. The belief that on the other side of our globe all thing s are by necessity upside down is star - tlingly brought back to the man when he rst se ts foot at Yokohama. If his initial glance does not disclose the natives in the everyday feat of standing calm 46 on their heads, an attitude that his youthfully47 imagination conceived to be a necessary consequence of their geographical position, it does at least reveal them looking at the world as if from the standpoint of that eccentric posture. For they seem to him seeing 48 everything topsy-turvy. Whether it be that their antipodal situation has affected their brains, or whether it is the mind of the observer himself that has hitherto been wrong in undertaking to rectify the reverted 49 pictures presented by his retina, the result is undeniable. The world stands reversed, and, taking for granted his own uprightness, the stranger unhesitatingly 50 imputes to them an obliquity of vision. If the inversion is not precisely of the kind he e xpected, it is none the less striking, and impressively more real. If personal experience has denitely convinced him that the inhabit- ants of that underside of our planet do not a dhere to it head downwards, like flies on a ceil- ing (his early51 a priori deduction), they still appear antipodal. Intellectually, at least, their attitude sets gravity at deance. For to the minds eye 52 their world is one huge, comical antithesis of our own. What we regard intui- tively in one way from our standpoint, they as int uitively seen53 in a diametrically opposite manner from theirs. To speak backward, write backward, and read backward are but the ABCs of their contrariety. The inversion extends deeper than mere modes of expression, down in 54 the very matter of thought. Ideas of ours that we deem innate nd in them no home, while methods that strike us as preposterously unnatural appear to be their birthright. From the standing 55 of a wet umbrella on its handle instead of its head to dry to the striking of a match away in place of toward one, there seem to be no actions of our daily lives, however triv-ial, that does 56 not nd with them its appropri- ate reaction, equal but opposite. Indeed, to one anxious ab out conforming to the manners and customs of the country; the57 only road to right lies in following unswervingly that course that his inherited instincts assure him to be wrong. Yet these people are human beings; with al l their eccentricities, they58 are men and women like us. Physically we cannot but be cognizant of the fact, nor mentally but be con-scious of it. Like us, indeed, and yet so unlike were 59 they that we seem, as we gaze at them, to be viewing our own humanity in some mirth-provoking mirror of the mind, a mirror that shows us our own familiar thoughts, but all turned wrong side out. Humor holds the glass, and we become the sport of our own reflec-tions. But is it otherwise at home? Does not e very one of us, looking in the mirror, conceive ourself60 to be a very different-appearing per - son from what he or she is, forgetting that his o r her right side has become the left, and vice versa? Perhaps, could we once see ourselves as others see us, our surprise in the case of foreign peoples might be less pronounced. 264 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 46. f. NO CHANGE 54. f.

In the heat of the glowing July afternoon, the r oom, with blinds carefully closed, were61 full of a great calm. From the three windows, through the cracks of the old wooden shutters, came only a few scattered sunbeams which, in the midst of the obscurity, made a soft bright- ness that bathed surrounding objects in a dif-fused and tender light. It was cool here by c omparing with62 the overpowering heat that was felt outside, under the erce rays of the sun that blazed upon the front of the house. Standing before the press that faced the w indows, the paper that Dr. Pascal had come to lo ok for remained missing.63 With doors wide open, this immense press of carved oak, adorned with strong and handsome mountings of metal, dated 64 from the last century, dis- played within its capacious depths an extraor - dinary collection of papers and manuscripts of al l sorts, piled up in confusion and lled65 every shelf to overflowing. For more than 30 years the doctor had thrown into it every page he wrote, from brief notes to the complete texts of his great works on heredity. Thus it was that 66 his searches here were not always easy. He rum-maged patiently among the papers; and 67 when he at last found the one he was looking for, he smiled. (1) For an instant longer he remained near the b ookcase, reading the note68 by a golden sunbeam that came to him from the middle window. (2) In this dawnlike light, he appeared, with his snow-white hair and beard, strong and vigorous; although he was near 60, his color was so fresh, his features were so nely cut, his eyes were still so clear, and he had so youthful an air that one might have mistaken him, in his close-tting, maroon velvet jacket, as 69 a young man with powdered hair.70 \"Here,\"71 he said at last, \"you will copy this note. Raymond would never have been able to decipher my diabolical writing.\" He crossed the room and lied72 the paper beside the young girl, who stood working at a high desk in the embrasure of the window to the right. She did not even turn round, so engrossed was her attention with the pastel that she was at the moment rapidly sketching in with broad strokes of the crayon. Near her in a vase bloomed a stalk of hollyhocks of a singular shade of violet, striped with yellow. The prole of her small round head, with its short, fair hair, was clearly distinguishable; an exquisite 73 and serious prole, the straight forehead con-tracted in a frown of attention, the eyes of an azure blue, the nose delicately molded, the chin rm. Her bent neck, especially, of a milky whiteness, looked adorably youthful under the gold of the clustering curls. In her long black blouse 74 she seemed very tall, with her slight gure, slender throat, and flexible form, the flexible slenderness of the divine gures of the Renaissance. In spite of her 25 years, she still retained a childish75 air and looked hardly 18. 61. a. NO CHANGE b. is c. was d. are 62. f.

Read each passage carefully and then select the best possible answer for each question. Passage I\u2014Humanities These excerpts concern themselves with the nineteenth-century arguments made for and against women's right to vote in the United States. Excerpt 1 is from an address by Isabella Beecher Hooker before the International Council of Women in 1888. Excerpt 2 is from an 1878 report from the Senate's Committee on Privileges and Elections in response to a proposed constitutional amendment that would give women the right to vote. Excerpt 1 1 Fir st let me speak of the Constitution of the 2 United States, and assert that there is not a line 3 in it, nor a word, forbidding women to vote; 4 but, properly interpreted, that is, interpreted by 5 the Declaration of Independence, and by the 6 assertions of the Fathers, it actually guarantees 7 to women the right to vote in all elections, both 8 state and national. Listen to the preamble to the 9 constitution, and the preamble, you know, is 10 the key to what follows; it is the concrete, gen - 11 e ral statement of the great principles which 12 subsequent articles express in detail. The pre - 13 amb le says: \"We the People of the United States, 14 in Order to form a more perfect Union, estab - 15 lish justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide 16 for the common defence, promote the general 17 Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to 18 ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and 19 establish this Constitution for the United States 20 of America.\" 21 Commit this to memory, friends; learn it 22 by heart as well as by head, and I should have 23 no ne ed to argue the question before you of my 24 right to vote. For women are \"people\" surely, 25 and desire, as much as men, to say the least, to 26 establish justice and to insure domestic tran - 27 q uility; and, brothers, you will never insure 28 domestic tranquility in the days to come unless 29 you allow women to vote, who pay taxes and 30 bear equally with yourselves all the burdens of 31 society; for they do not mean any longer to 32 submit patiently and quietly to such injustice, 33 and the sooner men understand this and gra - 34 ciousl y submit to become the political equals of 35 their mothers, wives, and daughters\u2014aye, of 36 their grandmothers, for that is my category, 37 instead of their political masters, as they now 38 are, the sooner will this precious domestic tran - 39 q uility be insured. Women are surely \"people,\" I 40 said, and were when these words were written, 41 and were as anxious as men to establish justice 42 and promote the general welfare, and no one 43 will have the hardihood to deny that our fore - 44 mothe rs (have we not talked about our forefa - 45 the rs alone long enough?) did their full share in 46 the work of establishing justice, providing for 47 the common defense, and promoting the gen - 48 e ral welfare in all those early days. 49 The truth is, friends, that when liberties 50 had to be gained by the sword and protected by 51 the sword, men necessarily came to the front 52 and seemed to be the only creators and defend - 53 e rs of these liberties; hence all the way down 54 women have been content to do their patriotic 55 work silently and through men, who are the 56 ghters by nature rather than themselves, until 57 the present day; but now at last, when it is 58 established that ballots instead of bullets are to 59 rule the world . . . now, it is high time that 60 women ceased to attempt to establish justice 61 and promote the general welfare, and secure the 62 blessings of liberty to themselves and their pos - 63 t erity, through the votes of men. 277 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041- - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 Excerpt 2 This proposed amendment forbids the United Stat es or any State to deny or abridge the right to vote on account of sex. If adopted, it will make several millions of female voters, totally inexperienced in political affairs, quite gener - ally dependent upon the other sex, all incapable o f performing military duty and without the power to enforce the laws which their numeri-cal strength may enable them to make, and c omparatively very few of whom wish to assume the irksome and responsible political duties which this measure thrusts upon them. An experiment so novel, a change so great, should only be made slowly and in response to a general public demand, of the existence of which there is no evidence before your com-mittee. Petitions from various parts of the c ountry, containing by estimate about 30,000 names, have been presented to Congress asking for this legislation. They were procured through the efforts of woman-suffrage societies, thor - oughly organized, with active and zealous man- agers. The ease with which signatures may be p rocured to any petition is well known. The small number of petitioners, when compared with that of the intelligent women in the coun-try, is striking evidence that there exists among the m no general desire to take up the heavy burden of governing, which so many men seek to evade. It would be unjust, unwise, and impolitic to impose that burden on the great mass of women throughout the country who do not wish for it, to gratify the comparatively few who do. It has been strongly urged that without the right of suffrage women are and will be subjected to great oppression and injustice. But everyone who has examined the subject at all knows that without female suffrage, legislation for years has improved and is still improving the condition of women. The disabilities 42 imp osed upon her by the common law have, 43 one by one, been swept away until in most of 44 the States she has the full right to her property 45 and all, or nearly all the rights which can be 46 granted without impairing or destroying the 47 marriage relation. These changes have been 48 wrought by the spirit of the age, and are not, 49 generally at least, the result of any agitation by 50 women in their own behalf. 51 Nor can women justly complain of any 52 partiality in the administration of justice. They 53 have the sympathy of judges and particularly of 54 juries to an extent which would warrant loud 55 complaint on the part of their adversaries of 56 the sterner sex. Their appeals to legislatures 57 against injustice are never unheeded, and there 58 is no doubt that when any considerable part of 59 the women of any State really wish for the right 60 to vote it will be granted without the interven- 61 t ion of Congress. 62 Any State may grant the right of suffrage 63 to women. Some of them have done so to a lim- 64 it ed extent, and perhaps with good results. It is 65 evident that in some States public opinion is 66 much more strongly in favor of it than it is in 67 others.

Passage II\u2014Prose Fiction In excerpt 1, from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein explains his motive for creating his crea-ture. In excerpt 2, from H.G. Wells's 1896 novel T he Island of Dr. Moreau, Dr. Moreau explains to the nar - rator why he has been performing experiments on ani-mals to transform them into humans. Excerpt 1 1 I se e by your eagerness, and the wonder and 2 hope which your eyes express, my friend, that 3 you expect to be informed of the secret with 4 which I am acquainted; that cannot be: listen 5 patiently until the end of my story, and you will 6 easily perceive why I am reserved upon that 7 subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and 8 ardent as I then was, to your destruction and 9 infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my 10 precepts, at least by my example, how danger - 11 ous is the a cquirement of knowledge, and how 12 much happier that man is who believes his 13 native town to be the world, than he who 14 aspires to become greater than his nature 15 will allow. 16 When I found so astonishing a power 17 placed within my hand, I hesitated a long time 18 concerning the manner in which I should 19 employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of 20 bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for 21 the reception of it, with all its intricacies of 22 bers, muscles, and veins, still remained a work 23 of inconceivable difculty and labor. I doubted 24 at r st whether I should attempt the creation of 25 a being like myself, or one of simpler organiza- 26 t ion; but my imagination was too much exalted 27 by my rst success to permit me to doubt of my 28 ability to give life to an animal as complex and 29 wonderful as man. The materials at present 30 within my command hardly appeared adequate 31 to so arduous an undertaking; but I doubted 32 not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared 33 myself for a multitude of reverses; my opera- 34 t ions might be incessantly baffled, and at last 35 my work be imperfect: yet, when I considered 36 the improvement which every day takes place in 37 science and mechanics, I was encouraged to 38 hope my present attempts would at least lay the 39 foundations of future success. Nor could I con- 40 sid er the magnitude and complexity of my plan 41 as any argument of its impracticability. It was 42 with these feelings that I began the creation of 43 my human being. As the minuteness of the 44 parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I 45 resolved, contrary to my rst intention, to make 46 the being of a gigantic stature; that is to say, 47 about eight feet in height, and proportionally 48 large. After having formed this determination, 49 and having spent some months in successfully 50 collecting and arranging my materials, I began. 51 No one can conceive the variety of feelings 52 which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the 53 rst enthusiasm of success. Life and death 54 appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should 55 rst break through, and pour a torrent of light 56 into our dark world. A new species would bless 57 me as its creator and source; many happy and 58 excellent natures would owe their being to me. 59 No father could claim the gratitude of his child 60 so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursu- 61 i ng these reflections, I thought, that if I could 62 bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might 63 in process of time (although I now found it 64 impossible) renew life where death had appar - 65 en tly devoted the body to corruption. 280 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 66 These thoughts supported my spirits, 67 while I pursued my undertaking with unremit-68 ting ardor. My cheek had grown pale with 69 study, and my person had become emaciated 70 with connement. Sometimes, on the very 71 brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the 72 hope which the next day or the next hour 73 might realize. One secret which I alone pos-74 sessed was the hope to which I had dedicated 75 myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight 76 labors, while, with unrelaxed and breathless 77 eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-78 places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my 79 secret toil, as I dabbled among the unhallowed 80 damps of the grave, or tortured the living ani-81 mal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now 82 tremble, and my eyes swim with the remem- 83 brance; but then a resistless, and almost frantic, 84 impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have 85 lost all soul or sensation but for this one 86 pursuit. Excerpt 2 1 \" Yes. These creatures you have seen are animals 2 carven and wrought into new shapes. To that\u2014 3 to the study of the plasticity of living forms\u2014 4 my life has been devoted. I have studied for 5 years, gaining in knowledge as I go. I see you 6 look horried, and yet I am telling you nothing 7 new. It all lay in the surface of practical anat - 8 o my years ago, but no one had the temerity to 9 touch it. It's not simply the outward form of an 10 animal I can change. The physiology, the chem - 11 ical r hythm of the creature, may also be made 12 to undergo an enduring modication, of which 13 vaccination and other methods of inoculation 14 with living or dead matter are examples that 15 will, no doubt, be familiar to you. 16 \"A similar operation is the transfusion of 17 blood, with which subject indeed I began. 18 These are all familiar cases. Less so, and proba - 19 b ly far more extensive, were the operations of 20 those me dieval practitioners who made dwarfs 21 and beggar cripples and show-monsters; some 22 vestiges of whose art still remain in the prelimi - 23 nar y manipulation of the young mountebank 24 or contortionist. Victor Hugo gives an account 25 of them in L'Homme qui Rit. . . . But perhaps 26 my meaning grows plain now. You begin to see 27 that it is a possible thing to transplant tissue 28 from one part of an animal to another, or from 29 one animal to another, to alter its chemical 30 reactions and methods of growth, to modify 31 the articulations of its limbs, and indeed to 32 change it in its most intimate structure? 33 \"And yet this extraordinary branch of 34 knowledge has never been sought as an end, 35 and systematically, by modern investigators, 36 until I took it up! Some such things have been 37 hit upon in the last resort of surgery; most of 38 the kindred evidence that will recur to your 39 mind has been demonstrated, as it were, by 40 accident\u2014by tyrants, by criminals, by the 41 breeders of horses and dogs, by all kinds of 42 untrained clumsy-handed men working for 43 their own immediate ends. I was the rst man 44 to take up this question armed with antiseptic 45 surgery, and with a really scientic knowledge 46 of the laws of growth. 47 \"Yet one would imagine it must have been 48 practiced in secret before. Such creatures as 49 Siamese Twins. . . . And in the vaults of the 50 Inquisition. No doubt their chief aim was 51 artistic torture, but some, at least, of the 52 inquisitors must have had a touch of scientic 53 curiosity. . . .\" 54 \"But,\" said I. \"These things\u2014these ani - 55 mals talk!\" 56 He said that was so, and proceeded to 57 point out that the possibilities of vivisection do 58 not stop at a mere physical metamorphosis. A 59 pig may be educated. The mental structure is 60 even less determinate than the bodily. In our 61 growing science of hypnotism we nd the 281 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 62 promise of a possibility of replacing old inher - 63 ent instincts by new suggestions, grafting upon 64 or replacing the inherited xed ideas. . . . 65 But I asked him why he had taken the 66 human form as a model. There seemed to me 67 then, and there still seems to me now, a strange 68 wickedness in that choice. 69 He confessed that he had chosen that 70 form by chance. 71 \"I might just as well have worked to form 72 sheep into llamas, and llamas into sheep. I sup- 73 pose there is something in the human form 74 that appeals to the artistic turn of mind more 75 powerfully than any animal shape can. But I've 76 not conned myself to man-making. Once or 77 twice. . . .\" He was silent, for a minute perhaps. 78 \"These years! How they have slipped by! And 79 here I have wasted a day saving your life, and 80 am now wasting an hour explaining myself!\" 81 \"But,\" said I, \"I still do not understand. 82 Where is your justication for inflicting all this 83 pain? The only thing that could excuse vivisec- 84 tion to me would be some application\u2014\" 85 \"Precisely,\" said he. \"But you see I am dif- 86 ferently constituted. We are on different plat- 87 forms. You are a materialist.\" 88 \"I am not a materialist,\" I began hotly. 89 \"In my view\u2014in my view. For it is just 90 this question of pain that parts us. So long as 91 visible or audible pain turns you sick, so long as 92 your own pain drives you, so long as pain 93 underlies your propositions about sin, so long, 94 I tell you, you are an animal, thinking a little 95 less obscurely what an animal feels. This 96 pain\u2014\" 97 I gave an impatient shrug at such 98 sophistry. 99 \"Oh! But it is such a little thing.

Few words in a contractor's vocabulary carry mo re negative connotations than asbestos. According to the Asbestos Network, \"touted as a miracle substance,\" asbestos is the generic term for several naturally occurring mineral bers mined primarily for use as reproof insu-lation. Known for strength, flexibility, low elec-trical conductivity, and resistance to heat, asb estos is comprised of silicon, oxygen, hydro- gen, and assorted metals. Before the public kne w asbestos could be harmful to one's health, it was found in a variety of products to strengthen them and to provide insulation and re resistance. Asbestos is generally made up of ber b undles that can be broken up into long, thin bers. We now know from various studies that when this friable substance is released into the air and inhaled into the lungs over a period of time, it can lead to a higher risk of lung cancer and a condition known as asbestosis. Asbestosis, a thickening and scarring of the lung tissue, usually occurs when a person is exposed to high asbestos levels over an extensive period of time. Unfortunately, the symptoms do not usually appear until about 20 years after initial expo- sure, making it difcult to reverse or prevent. In a ddition, smoking while exposed to asbestos bers could further increase the risk of devel-oping lung cancer. When it comes to asbestos e xposure in the home, school, and workplace, there is no safe level; any exposure is considered harmful and dangerous. Prior to the 1970s asbestos use was ubiquitous\u2014many commer - cial building and home insulation products c ontained asbestos. In the home in particular, there are many places where asbestos hazards 283 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 38 might be present. Building materials that may 39 contain asbestos include reproong material 40 (sprayed on beams), insulation material (on 41 pipes and oil and coal furnaces), and acoustical 42 or soundproong material (sprayed onto ceil- 43 ings and walls); it is found in miscellaneous 44 materials, such as asphalt, vinyl, and cement, 45 used to make products like roong felts, shin- 46 gles, siding, wallboard, and floor tiles. 47 We advise homeowners and concerned 48 consumers to examine material in their homes 49 if they suspect it may contain asbestos. If the 50 material is in good condition, bers will not 51 break down and release the chemical debris 52 that may be a danger to members of the house- 53 hold. Asbestos is a powerful substance and 54 should be handled by an expert. Do not touch 55 or disturb the material\u2014it may then become 56 damaged and release bers. Contact local 57 health, environmental, or other appropriate 58 ofcials to nd out proper handling and dis- 59 posal procedures, if warranted. If asbestos 60 removal or repair is needed, you should contact 61 a professional. 62 Asbestos contained in high-trafc public 63 buildings, such as schools, presents the oppor - 64 tunity for disturbance and potential exposure 65 to students and employees. To protect individu- 66 als, the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response 67 Act (AHERA) was signed in 1986. This law 68 requires public and private nonprot primary 69 and secondary schools to inspect their build- 70 ings for asbestos-containing building materials. 71 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 72 has published regulations for schools to follow 73 in order to protect against asbestos contamina- 74 tion and provide assistance to meet the AHERA 75 requirements. These include performing an 76 original inspection and periodic reinspections 77 every three years for asbestos-containing mate- 78 rial; developing, maintaining, and updating an 79 asbestos management plan at the school; 80 providing yearly notication to parent, teacher, 81 and employee organizations regarding the 82 availability of the school's asbestos manage- 83 ment plan and any asbestos abatement actions 84 taken or planned in the school; designating a 85 contact person to ensure the responsibilities of 86 the local education agency are properly imple- 87 mented; performing periodic surveillance of 88 known or suspected asbestos-containing build- 89 ing material; and providing custodial staff with 90 asbestos awareness training. 21.

In Manhattan's Eighth Avenue/Fourteenth St reet subway station, a grinning bronze alliga- tor with human hands pops out of a manhole c over to grab a bronze \"baby\" whose head is the shape of a moneybag. In the Bronx General Post Ofce, a giant 13-panel painting called Resources of America celebrates the hard work and industrialism of the country in the rst half of the twentieth century. And in Brooklyn's MetroTech Center just over the Brooklyn Bridge, several installations of art are on view at any given time\u2014such as an iron lasso resem-bling a giant charm bracelet, a series of wagons that pla y recordings of great American poems, and a life-sized seeing-eye dog that looks so real people are constantly stopping to pet it. There exists in every city a symbiotic rela- tionship between the city and its art. When we hear the t erm art, we tend to think of private art\u2014the kind displayed in private spaces such as museums, concert halls, and galleries. But there is a growing interest in, and respect for, public art: the kind of art created for and dis-played in public spaces such as parks, building lo bbies, and sidewalks. Although all art is inherently public\u2014 cr eated in order to convey an idea or emotion to others\u2014public art, as opposed to art that is sequestered in museums and galleries, is art specically designed for a public arena where the art will be encountered by people in their normal day-to-day activities. Public art can be purely ornamental or highly functional; it can be as subtle as a decorative doorknob or as con- spicuous as the Chicago Picasso. It is also an esse ntial element of effective urban design. The more obvious forms of public art inc lude monuments, sculptures, fountains, 285 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 39 murals, and gardens. But public art also takes 40 the form of ornamental benches or streetlights, 41 decorative manhole covers, and mosaics on 42 trash bins. Many city dwellers would be sur - 43 prised to discover just how much public art is 44 really around them and how much art they 45 have passed by without noticing, as well as 46 how much impact public art has on their day- 47 to-day lives. 48 Public art fullls several functions essen- 49 tial to the health of a city and its citizens. It 50 educates about history and culture\u2014of the art- 51 ist, the neighborhood, the city, and the nation. 52 Public art is also a place-making device that 53 instantly creates memorable, experiential land- 54 marks, fashioning a unique identity for a public 55 place, personalizing it and giving it a specic 56 character. It stimulates the public, challenging 57 viewers to interpret the art and arousing their 58 emotions, and it promotes community by stim- 59 ulating interaction among viewers. In serving 60 these multiple and important functions, public 61 art beauties the area and regenerates both the 62 place and the viewer. 63 One question often debated in public art 64 forums is whether public art should be created 65 with or by the public rather than for the public. 66 Increasingly, cities and artists are recognizing 67 the importance of creating works with meaning 68 for the intended audience, and this generally 69 requires direct input from the community or 70 from an artist entrenched in that community. 71 At the same time, however, art created for the 72 community by an outsider often adds fresh per - 73 spective. Thus, cities and their citizens are best 74 served by a combination of public art created 75 by me mbers of the community, art created with 76 input from members of the community, and art 77 created by others for the community. 31. The primary purpose of the opening paragraph is t o a. dene public art. b. introduce readers to the idea of public art. c. show the prevalence and diversity of public ar t. d. get readers to pay more attention to public ar t. 32. The word inherently in line 26 most nearly means f. essentially. g. complicated. h. wealthy. j. snobby. 33. According to the rst sentence of paragraph 2, pub lic art is differentiated from private art mainly by a. the kind of ideas or emotions it aims to c onvey to its audience. b. its accessibility. c. its perceived value. d. its importance to the city. 34. The use of the word sequestered in line 29 s uggests that the author feels f. private art is better than public art. g. private art is too isolated from the public. h. the admission fees for public art arenas p revent many people from experiencing the art. j. private art is more difcult to understand than pub lic art. 35. According to the next to last paragraph, public ar t serves all of the following functions EXCEPT a. beautication. b. creation of landmarks. c. the fostering of community. d. the promotion of good citizenship. 286 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 36.

Passage I\u2014Conflicting Viewpoints For hundreds of years, it has been known that volca - nic rock is often magnetized with the same polarity fo und in a north-pointing compass. Accidental obser - vation conrmed by careful experimentation has p roven that many minerals or mineral-containing substances such as clay will become similarly magne-tized when heated. By the early nineteenth century, it was recog- nized that many volcanic rocks were magnetized with a polarity the reverse of that produced by the earth's magnetic eld, which is called the geomagnetic eld, and that others had polarities that diverged from nor - mal, but were not entirely reversed. In the 1950s and 1960s, extensive mapping of the ocean floor was undertaken using technologies developed during World War II. It was discovered that the ocean floor was magnetically striped. There were clearly measurable strips of reverse polarity in between larger strips of normal polarity. Scientists 1 and 2 accept this general under - standing of the situation, but they disagree on the cause of reversed polarity in some mineral specimens. 287 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 Scientist 1 The phenomenon of reversed polarity is too wide-spread to be accounted for by local peculiarities. The same phenomenon exists at many volcanic sites on land and also in widespread areas of the sea floor. Some scientists point to self-reversal of polarity, but this occurs only in limited types of rock specimens, while the reverse polarity phenomenon exists in min-erals that have never been observed to self-reverse. The magnetic stripes on the seabed occur b ecause molten lava seeps up through large seams in the underwater crust and hardens with the polarity induced by the existing magnetic eld, just as volca-nic rock on dry land does. There are deep trenches on the seafloor into which seabed material sinks after spreading out from the ocean ridges, so that crust material is constantly recycled without an overall expansion of the earth's crust. The only thing that can account for the wide- spread reversal in polarity is a history of reversals in the e ntire geomagnetic eld. Scientist 2 There is not adequate evidence to explain the p henomenon of magnetic reversal in some mineral specimens, but there is nothing unexpected in it. Vol-canic rock in any given location is magnetized by the lo cal, not the global, magnetic environment. Local magnetic elds often differ from the direction of the geomagnetic eld. It is also proven that some mineral compositions undergo what is called self-reversal. They reorganize their own magnetic polarity under certain heat and other conditions. If there were a geo-magnetic reversal for every magnetic stripe on the seaflo or, there would have to have been hundreds, perhaps thousands, of total reversals of the planet's magnetic eld in the course of its 4.5-billion-year his-tory. Yet there is no evidence of the catastrophic dis- ruption of all systems on the earth that would occur if the magnetic poles were reversed. Magnetic striping on the ocean floor may be e xplained by ocean currents, geophysical strains on the earth's mantle beneath the crust, or other factors that must be determined. The idea that lava is con-stantly seeping up and spreading out over the ocean flo or is absurd. If that were the case, the oceans would quickly ll up with rock and the earth would be con-stantly expanding and becoming hollow inside. 1. Which of these statements do Scientists 1 and 2 ag ree on? a. Molten or heated minerals are often mag netized by the magnetic eld they are heated in. b. The earth's magnetic eld periodically r everses itself. c. What appears to be a single geomagnetic e ld is actually an accumulation of magnetic elds in each locality on the planet. d. There is no relationship between what hap pens to minerals in volcanoes and what happens beneath the sea. 288 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 2. What is the major disagreement on geomag- netic reversal between Scientist 1 and Scie ntist 2? f. Scientist 1 believes that most differences in mine ral polarity are caused by radical changes in the geomagnetic eld. Scientist 2 believes that all minerals are magnetized with the same polarity, but that local conditions or the internal composition of minerals sometimes cause them to reverse their polarity. g. Scientist 1 believes that the geomagnetic e ld remains virtually constant. Scientist 2 believes that minerals' polarity is xed by local conditions, which may or may not accord with the geomagnetic eld. h. Scientist 1 believes that the geomagnetic e ld accounts for almost all magnetization of minerals, but that the geomagnetic eld periodically changes polarity. Scientist 2 believes that the geomagnetic eld has consistently had the same polarity and that local differences in the polarity of magnetized minerals are explained by local conditions. j. Scientist 1 believes that the geomagnetic e ld reorganizes the structure of hot and molten rock regardless of its orientation. Scientist 2 believes that volcanoes eject minerals in all directions, so there is no reason to believe they will be magnetized in the same direction. 3. Which of these statements would both Scientist 1 and Scie ntist 2 disagree with? a. The geomagnetic eld is highly variable. b. There is a denite pattern to changes in the mag netic polarity on the seafloor. c. Heated minerals become magnetized by the ir magnetic environment. d. The geomagnetic eld is uniform thr oughout the entire planet. 4. Improved techniques for determining the age o f rock specimens demonstrate that the anom- alies in polarity are consistent among speci-mens produced at the same time from many sit es on land and beneath the sea in minerals formed anywhere from several hundreds of thousands of years to hundreds of millions of years ago. Which answer is the best statement of the impact of this new evidence on the controversy? f. This makes the case for Scientist 1's views on p eriodic geomagnetic reversal. Neither self- reversal nor any local magnetic conditions can explain polarity being reversed in almost all minerals created anywhere on the planet at a given time. g. This is not conclusive. There is still only a limit ed sampling of minerals available, and there may be some reason why the samples available for study share this characteristic. h. The process of mineral formation beneath the sea diff ers from volcanic formation on the surface. Therefore, no conclusion can be reached simply because the results beneath the sea agree with those on land. j. There are astronomic and other events that aff ect the entire planet at once. Geomagnetic reversal is not the only possible explanation for this. 289 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 5. A theory was advanced in the early twentieth c entury that the continents were slowly but constantly moving farther apart from each other without changing the overall size of the earth. This had been generally rejected as being based on only circumstantial evidence without any explanation of how continents could suc-cessfully slide over the ocean floor. In what way mig ht acceptance of Scientist 1's views change the view of the theory of continental drift? a. If the ocean floor is spreading out from und ersea ridges, the continents can be moving apart by moving with the ocean floor. b. If large sections of the earth's crust are mo ving in relation to each other, this might explain other phenomena, such as why earthquakes and volcanoes seem to occur mainly along certain established lines. c. The theory does explain a number of int eresting things, such as why the continents seem to be shaped as if they would t together, and how various plant and animal species developed at the same time on what are now widely separated continents. d. All of the above are reasonable. 6. How might Scientist 1 reasonably answer Sci- entist 2's objection that geomagnetic reversal w ould have a catastrophic effect on the earth? f. In fact, the earth has had a series of calamit ies: floods, snowball Earth, mass extinction of species, and so on, which may be explained by geomagnetic reversal. g. It's not clear what the overall impact of g eomagnetic reversal would be, other than changing the polarity of rocks created under its influence. Most substances, biological or not, experience the intensity of a magnetic eld, not its polarity. This is an issue requiring further investigation. h. The geomagnetic reversal affects only small p ortions of the earth at any given time. j. Since geomagnetic reversals have occurred w ithout these calamities, we know they are not a concern. 7. The oceans have been with us since before the da wn of humans. Why was magnetic striping of the sea floor not recognized until the 1950s? a. This did not become an interesting question unt il the process of geomagnetic reversal was understood. b. The submarine was invented during World W ar II and not available for scientic use until the 1950s. c. Magnetic polarity is much more difcult to meas ure than its intensity. d. Technologies for measuring magnetism on the sea flo or became available after World War II and were used for this purpose beginning in the 1950s. 290 - - lution ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 Passage II\u2014Research Summary Living cells consist of various structures in the cyto- plasm fluid that protects and nourishes them, sur - rounded by a permeable membrane. The cells are us ually immersed in some kind of fluid. Single-celled plants and animals are surrounded by seawater or freshwater. Other cells are immersed in a fluid deliv- ered to them by the organisms of which they are part. T he regulation of the movement of materials between the cytoplasm and the fluid outside the cell is an important factor in the health and well-being of the cell. This transport of materials is divided into passive and active transport processes. The former are pro-cesses that cells share with nonliving fluids and mem-branes. The active processes are processes in which the living activity of the cell selects materials to be moved into or out of the cell. Osmosis is the tendency of fluids to equalize the ir concentration across a permeable membrane. This passive transport process is one of the most important features of cell life. High-concentration solutions extract water from low-concentration solu- tions until they are equalized. If the fluid surround- ing the cell has a higher concentration than the cy toplasm, it is hypertonic. If it has a lower concen- tration, it is hypotonic. If it has an equal concentra-tion, it is isotonic. Larger differences in concentration b etween the fluids on either side of a membrane will cause larger osmotic pressure and faster rates of transport across the membrane. Plasmolysis is the process of extracting fluid from a cell. Deplasmolysis is the process of replenishing the fluid in a cell. Hypertonic so Plasmolysis Hypotonic solution Deplasmolysis Healthy green plant cell Figure 1 Figure 1 illustrates what happens when a cell is treated rst by a hypertonic solution and then by a hypotonic solution. Experiment 1 Test various plant cell preparations. For each prepa- ration, transfer plant cell material to three different micr oscopic slides. Treat each slide with solutions of 1%, 2%, and 5% NaCl (sodium chloride). Observe them over a 10-minute period. 291 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 Experiment 2 First, bathe a batch of plant cells having a 20% inter - nal sucrose solution in a solution of 40% sucrose. S ucrose cannot pass through the cell membrane, but water can. After observing the result under a micro-scope, gently rinse the sucrose solution from the cells w ith distilled water. Prepare slides and observe the samples in a distilled water bath for 20 minutes. 8. What would you expect to observe in experi-ment 1 if the original plant cells had a 1.5% N aCl concentration? f. Plasmolysis in all cases. It will be quickest in the 1%, slower in the 5%, and slowest in the 2% solution. g. Plasmolysis in all cases. It will be faster in hig her-concentration and slower in lower- concentration solutions. h. Deplasmolysis in the 1% solution, modest plasmol ysis in the 2% solution, and rapid plasmolysis in the 5% solution. j. Plasmolysis in the 1% solution, modest d eplasmolysis in the 2% solution, and rapid deplasmolysis in the 5% solution. 9. If the cytoplasm of the plant cell tested in e xperiment 1 has a 3% NaCl concentration, what would be the proper term for describing the 1%, the 2%, and the 5% hypotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic 10. If a group of plant cells were tested using a se ries of test solutions with the resulting plas- molysis (P) or deplasmolysis (D) as indicated, w hat would be the concentration of the solu- f. 1.8% g. 1.5% h. 2.0% j. 1.0% 11. What is the best description for the expected stat e of the plant cells after the rst phase of experiment 2? a. isotonic b. deplasmolytic c. plasmolytic d. hypertonic 12. Which answer best describes what would be e xpected to occur at the beginning of the obser - vation period of experiment 2? f. osmosis g. deplasmolysis h. plasmolysis j. isotonicism 13. What is the most reasonable prognosis for the c ells in experiment 2? a. Deplasmolysis will continue until the mixt ure becomes isotonic. b. Plasmolysis will continue until the cells are c ompletely shriveled. c. Deplasmoysis will continue until the cells b urst from the pressure of the internal fluid. d. Deplasmolysis will continue until the osmot ic pressure increases sufciently to force a change back to plasmolysis. 292 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 Passage III\u2014Research Summary Coulomb's law on the strength of the electrostatic force between two objects is one of the many \"inverse square\" laws encountered in the study of physics. Its formula is: k \u00d7 Q1 \u00d7 Q2 F = 2d The force between the two objects equals a constant (k), which depends on the medium in which the charged objects are located, multiplied by the force on each object (Q 1 and Q2), divided by the square of the distance (d) between them. The charge on either object can be positive or negative. If both charges have the same sign, their product and the calculated force (F) will be positive, which means the forces will repel the objects. If the charges have different signs, F will be negative, meaning the objects will be attracted to each other. Charged objects can be treated as if the entire charge were located at the center of charge of the object. For a spherical object, this would be the center of the sphere. Figure 1 illustrates an apparatus that is used to d emonstrate Coulomb's law. It consists of a 1-meter- high frame in the shape of a triangular prism. Two identical spheres are used. Sphere A is suspended from two equal-length dielectric (nonconducting) cords from the top ends of two of the vertical struts of the frame. Sphere B is attached to a dielectric rod that can be slid up and down the third strut and clamped into position at any height. The clamp's length is such that sphere B will be located directly above or below sphere A. The effect is that sphere B can slide toward sphere A from either above or below, and its distance above or below sphere A can always be measured. In order to avoid accidental charge or discharge of the two spheres, the entire frame, includ- ing the base it rests on, is dielectric. A B Figure 1 Experiment 1 Spheres A and B each have a mass of 1 gram. Sphere B is positioned well below sphere A, near the base of the apparatus. Both spheres are positively charged with 1 unit of charge. Sphere B is then carefully moved up toward sphere A. When sphere B reaches a distance of 10 cm from sphere A, sphere A moves. Experiment 2 Sphere B is positioned above sphere A near the top of the apparatus. Both spheres are negatively charged with 1 unit of charge. Sphere B is moved toward Sphere A. 293 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 14. Look at the explanation of Coulomb's law and the d escription of experiment 1. What is the best description of why sphere A moves? f. The charge on sphere B pulls it down. g. The repulsive force between the two spheres b ecomes strong enough at a distance of 10 cm to overcome the force of gravity holding sphere A in place. h. At 10 cm, the charged spheres are close e nough so that a spark is generated between them. The thermal force of the spark causes sphere A to jump. j. The strings prevent sphere A from moving d ownward, so it moves sideways. 15. Experiment 1 is repeated with each sphere neg- atively charged to 2 units. According to Cou- lomb's law, at what distance from sphere B will sp here A move? a. -40 cm b. 20 cm c. 40 cm d. 200 cm 16. Repeat experiment 1 once more with a positive c harge of 1 on sphere A and a negative charge of 2 on sphere B. At what distance from sphere B will sphere A move? f. when sphere B touches it g. 10 cm 1 h. 10 \u00d7 22 cm j. 20 cm 17. Consider experiment 2 based on the result r eported for experiment 1. At what distance from sphere B will sphere A move in experi-ment 2? a. 10 cm b. never c. 20 cm 1 d. 10 \u00d7 32 cm 18.

Figure 1 illustrates the main structures of the earth. The thickness of the crust would be seen only as a boundary line at the scale of this drawing. It is approximately 10 km thick under the ocean floor and 20 km thick under the land surface. Shock waves radiate outward in all directions fr om the point of origin (the epicenter) of an earth- quake. Primary (P) and secondary (S) body waves t ravel through the earth. Surface waves, called Love or Rayleigh waves after the scientists who identied them, travel on the surface of the earth. The body waves move the fastest, but the surface waves cause the most damage because they strike where we live. P , S, Love, and Rayleigh waves emanating from an earthquake epicenter about 300 km below the surface are illustrated in Figure 1. 294 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 Rayleigh and Love waves Epicenter P and S waves Crust Mantle Outer core Inner core Figure 1 The velocities and frequencies of these waves vary with distance from the epicenter and with the com-position of the material they are traveling through. Our modern network of seismographs is used t o track and forecast the course of an earthquake. One early warning calculation is based on the rule of thumb that in the range of 50 to 500 km from the epicenter, P waves travel at approximately 8 km/s and S waves at approximately 4 km/s. Knowing this, we know the following: D km/s TP is the time it takes the P wave to travel from the epicenter to the recording station, and TS is the time it takes the S wave. D is the distance to the epicenter. Study 1 Seismographic stations A, B, and C are positioned as in Figure 2. S and P waves were recorded at each of the stations as indicated in Table 1. Using the preced-ing formula, the distance to the epicenter from each stat ion is calculated, and a circle is drawn to scale at the appropriate distance to the epicenter from each station. 295 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000- - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 A 30\u00ba C BA 2 3 B 120\u00ba C 30\u00ba 4 1 250 km 250 km 433 km Figure 2 TABL E 1 STATION P WAVE S W AVEDIFFERENCE ( SECONDS) A 05:33:10 05:33:25 15 B 05:33:15 05:33:35 20 C 05:33:43 05:34:31 48 Study 2 On the following day, the same three stations report ne w evidence of earthquake shocks.

Look at Table 2 again. Based on the explanation in the passag e of how to approximate the dis- tance from readings of P and S waves to the e picenter of an earthquake, provide a complete explanation for why these readings should be considered reliable or suspect reports of a single shock. f. There is no reason to question them. All of the t ime intervals given are correctly computed from the arrival times of the P and S waves given. g. The reported times are off. Station C r eported the P wave at the same time as station A, but the difference between the P and S wave times was 8 times as great at station C. h. The reports cannot be accurate. The distance o f the epicenter from station C would have to be at least 500 to 600 km. That would be on a circle outside the circles determined for both station A and station B. No single epicenter could be determined from this report. j. Answer choices g and h are both reasons to r eassess this report. 25. Look at Table 2 again.

Acids and bases occur in conjugate pairs consisting of an acid and the base formed when it loses its proton. When the reac-tion is reversed, the base of the pair adds a proton to f orm the acid once more.

Based on the denition of acids and bases given and an e xamination of Table 1, which of the following statements best characterizes this denition? f. It clearly distinguishes acids from bases by the nat ure of the ionic bonding in the compounds. g. Some compounds change their charge from ne gative to positive and can be either acids or bases. h. The denition is based on the way each c ompound functions in specic chemical reactions. j. It is o verly dependent on the role of hydrogen. Passage VI\u2014Data Representation Conditions on Earth are very much affected by the interaction between the earth's magnetic eld, the sun's magnetic eld, and the solar wind consisting of hot ionized plasmas constantly streaming around and through the earth's magnetic eld and atmosphere. The solar wind includes storms, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with sunspots and solar flares. Often, the earth's magnetic eld is described as a dipole magnet, but there are signicant differences other than its size and nearly spherical shape that dis-tinguish the earth's so-called magnet from the ones w e are familiar with handling. Figure 1 illustrates the magnetic eld lines sur - rounding a typical oblong dipole magnet. Figure 2 il lustrates the earth's magnetosphere in relation to the solar magnetic eld and the solar wind. Every 11 years, the sun goes through a cycle of incr easing activity and then decreasing activity, reversing magnetic polarity at the low-activity point, and then increasing activity with reversed polarity. Periods of high activity include greater density of CMEs. Figure 3 illustrates this cycle. When the curve is positive, the sun's polarity is aligned with the earth's; when the curve is negative, its polarity is opposed to the earth's.

Look at Figure 1 and Figure 2. What best d escribes the difference in shape between the earth's magnetosphere and a typical dipole magnetic eld? a. The earth's magnetosphere is extended ho rizontally more than vertically. b. The earth's magnetic eld is much larger in c omparison to the size of the earth than the dipole's is in comparison to the size of the magnet. c. The dipole's eld is nearly symmetrical, but the ear th's magnetosphere is compressed on the side closest to the sun and extended out into a long tail on the side opposite the sun. d. The earth's magnetic eld is much stronger than the dip ole's. 32. Figure 2 shows the magnetic elds of the earth, the s un, and a CME. The CMEs carry highly active ionized plasmas to the earth. The CME in Figure 2 illustrates how most CME magnetic elds orient in relation to the sun's magnetic eld.

When CME magnetic elds are aligned with the ear th's, up to 20 times as many plasma ions will inltrate the earth's magnetosphere as when the elds are opposed.

However, the usual mineral and gaseous additions to water turn it into a very good conductor. An aqueous solution of electrically charged ions makes an excel- lent conductor.

It is based on the conductivity of the electrolytic solution, the effective contact area of the electrodes, and the dis-tance between the electrodes. Electrolytic Cell Electrolytic fluid Electr odes Figure 1 These elements are determined as follows: The specic conductivity of the cell, mS, equals the conductivity of the solution, k, multiplied by the area of the electrodes and divided by the distance between the electrodes. 2 Formula 1: Sm (or mS) = k(A)m 1 The conductivity of an electrolytic solution is pro- portional to the molar conductivity of the electrolyte, 1 , multiplied by the molar concentration, c. The m molar conductivity is a measure of how much con- ductivity is added by each mole/liter concentration of the e lectrolyte in an aqueous solution: Formula 2: 1 = k or k = 1 c c m m where c is the molar concentration of the electrolyte. Higher concentrations of electrolyte increase the specic conductivity. The last thing to know is that molar conductivity is not the same at all levels of concentration. Lower levels of concentration have higher molar conductivity according to this formula: 1 Formula 3: 1 = 10 Kc 2 m m K is a constant specic to each electrolyte, and 10 is m the 1 at nearly zero concentration.

The modifying clause as played by such men as Norman E. Brookes and R.N. Williams should be both preceded and followed by a comma. 2. h. The game of tennis, not the men who play it, has its basis in science. 3. d. This form agrees with the present form of the earlier verb hopes and the later verb adhere. 4. h. In this case the proper preposition is on. 5. c. In order to modify the verb began, an adverb\u2014in this case, inc orrectly\u2014must be used. 6. g. All the other choices would indicate that the author had the same training as the Ameri - can boys have at the present time, which is counter to the intended meaning of the sentence. 7. d. The indenite article an is appropriate here. 8. j. T his is the proper and logical sequencing; answer choice h mistakenly uses giving instead of given . 9. d. T he word yes, when used singly, is not enclosed in quotation marks except in direct discourse. 10. f. C omprising, or being made up of, is the cor - rect word choice. 11. d. T he word besieged, meaning pressed with requests, is appropriate here. 12. f. T he sentence is correct as it is. 13. d. T he narrator has already described the pro- cess as wasting time, so this sentence is unne cessary. 14. h. T he sentence describing the questions (sen- tence 3) should precede the sentence e xplaining how the narrator answered them (sentence 2). 15. d. T he text ends abruptly and would benet from a paragraph that ties things together. Passage II\u2014The Geography and Geology of Hartfor d, Connecticut 16. h. The only commas needed are those required to set apart the modifying clause in lesser degree. T he sentence would not require com-mas without that phrase. 17. a. The sentence is correct as is. The present verb sink agrees with the plurality of the ancient highlands and the present tense of the sentence. 18. h. The possessive form is correct here. 19. c. This option correctly connects the subject the trough with its verb, w as lled, and prop- erly places the modifying clause immediately after them. 20. g. This puts the verb to burst properly in the past tense. 21. a. The sentence is correct as it is. 22. h. This employs the correct verb form and the correct idiom one above another. 23. d. The verb form rests, rather than the adjective form resting, is required in this case. 24. h. A colon is necessary to present the explana- tory statement that follows. 25. b. The word implosion, deriving from the verb implode, to burst inward, is not appropriate for this sentence. 26. f. The sentence is correct as it is. 27. b. The comma, together with the conjunction so, should separate the two independent clauses. 28. j.

T he author's ridicule is not mean-spirited but instead an attempt to make foolish theo-ries seem quite normal. 41. b. T his is the most logical order with which to present the information. 42. h. T his option provides the sentence with cor - rect structure\u2014subject, adverb, verb, object, o bject modier, and prepositional phrase. 43. d. I n this case the best preposition is into, indi- cating not just a location but also the process o f becoming part of something. 44. h. Whereas obtuse can be used to mean dull or dim-witted, abst ruse indicates esoteric and hard to understand, and thus works with the rest of the sentence. 45. d. Sentence 9 should follow sentence 7, because it follows the admonition to not laugh at them too heartily by adding that the people who present such speculations are no more ridiculous than the old Greeks; sentence 8 should be the nal sentence because it expands on sentence 9.

Passage V\u2014Doctor Pascal 61. c. T he verb should agree with the singular room, not the plural blinds. 62. h. W hen using a form of the verb to compare, combine it with to in order to emphasize similarities, but combine it with with to emphasize differences. 63. c. T he subject of the sentence, Dr. Pascal, must be introduced immediately after the modify- ing clause and the comma. 64. g. T he appropriate expression in this case is dating from, meaning going back to a speci-ed time. 65. d. T he present participle of the verb\u2014lling\u2014 is appropriate for the second of a tandem of verbs occurring contemporaneously, in this case piled up and lling. 66. h. T he conjunction because by itself does not have the meaning\u2014for this reason\u2014 necessary to the sentence. 67. d. T his sentence contains two independent clauses, which need to be separated by a coordinating conjunction\u2014in this case, and\u2014and a comma. 68. f. T he sentence is correct as it is. 69. d. T he proper expression is mistaken for, not mistaken as; the modifying clause that is placed in between\u2014in his close-tting, maroon velvet jacket\u2014has no bearing on this usage. 70. h. The sentence as it is structured is grammati-cally sound (except as should be for), and the deletion of such phrases as snow-white hair and beard, color was so fresh, features were so nely cut, and close-tting, maroon velvet jacket would lessen the descriptive power of the sentence. 71. a. The appropriate punctuation, a comma, is properly placed inside the quotation mark. 72. h. The sentence calls for the past tense of the transitive verb to lay (to place down), which is laid, as opposed to the past tense of the intransitive verb to lie (to be or place oneself at rest). 73. b. A comma is appropriate to separate an inde- pendent clause from a dependent clause. In this case, everything after the comma describes (modies) the prole mentioned in the preceding independent clause. 74. h. The two adjectives, long and black, both modify the same noun, dr ess; they are there- fore coordinate adjectives and should be separated by a comma. 75. d.

T he numerical parts of the factors must have a product of -18 and a difference of +3, so the factors would be (x + 6) and (x - 3). 310 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 5. a. T he absolute value of (5 - 3) is 2, and the absolute value of (12 - 6) is 6, so the value of the equation is 2 minus 6, or -4. 6. h.

There- 1fore, 25% of y, or of y, is 4. This is also 4 10%, or 1 of x, so x must equal 40. 10 9. e. T he area of a rectangle is found by multiply- ing length times width. The original length, x , is increased by 7 and becomes (x + 7); the original width, y, is decreased by 8 and becomes (y - 8). 10. h. B ecause the two sides are congruent, the tri- angle is an isosceles triangle, and the two base ang les are also congruent. Those angles add up to 84\u00b0, and because the three angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0, the remaining angle must be 96\u00b0. 6 + x11. e. To solve, set up a proportion where = 8+ x 2, and solve for x. Or, use trial and error by 3 substituting in the given answers. Adding 34 to both -6 and 8 yields the fraction 28, which 42 is equal to 2 3. 12. g. Fir st, convert all three bases to base 3; the equation becomes (3x)(32) = (33)2. Accord - ing to the rules of exponents, this means that x + 2 = 6, and x = 4. 13. a. T o solve, systematically go through the mul- tiples of 6 to determine those that are also fa ctors of 180. They are 6, 12, 18, 30, 36, 60, and 90. 14. k. A dd the parts of the ratio (5 and 6) together. This indicates there are 11 units in total, and these units add up to 242, so one unit equals 22.There are six units of tulips in the gar - den, so multiply 6 times 22 to nd the answ er. 15. b. Fir st, multiply 30 times 42 to nd the total square footage in the dormitory. Then take this total (1,260) and divide it by 35 to nd the new square footage per man. Subtract that gure, 36, from the original gure of 42 to nd the difference. 16. j. Find 20% o f $85 by multiplying 0.20 times 85.Subtract the answer, 17, from 85 to nd the o n-sale price of $68. Now nd 10% of 68 by multiplying 0.10 times 68, and add that gure to $68 to nd the nal price of the coat. 17. a. T he given statement can be put into if/then form by saying If it is Sunday, then Isabelle is running. Thus it can be denitively con-cluded using deductive reasoning that if Isa-belle is not running, it could not be Sunday. 18. h. S ince line AB is perpendicular to line GH, then angle ABC is a right angle. Angle EAD creates a linear pair with angle DAF, and since DAF equals 120\u00b0, angle EAD must equal 60\u00b0. Angle BCA is a corresponding angle to angle EAD, and therefore also 60\u00b0. Thus triangle ABC is a 30-60-90 right trian-gle, and side AB is the long leg of this trian- gle. By rule, the short leg is half the h ypotenuse, or 5, and the long leg is equal to the short leg times 3. 19. c. S imply use x and y to represent the original dimensions. In this case, the area would equal x times y, or xy. Now triple the dimen- sions to become 3x and 3y. The new area is 3 x times 3y, or 9xy, which is 9 times larger than the original area. 20. j. T he chart indicates that buying balloons 1,000 at a time costs $0.60 per balloon, or 2,000 times $0.60, which equals $1,200, for 2,000 balloons. Buying balloons 10 at a time costs $0.90 per balloon, or 2,000 times $0.90, which equals $1,800, for 2,000 bal- loons. The difference between $1,800 and $1,200 r epresents the amount saved. 311 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 21. e. S even cards have been removed from the deck. Of the remaining cards, three numbers\u20144, 20, and 40\u2014are both multiples of 4 and factors of 40. The probability of one of these cards being selected is 3 out of 33, or 1 out of 11. 22. h. Fir st, apply the operation to the expression inside the parentheses, and you get the 2quantity (n - m). Now, again apply the 2operation to the expression m#(n - m). 2The resulting expression is m2 - (n - m), and distributing the negative sign yields m 2 + m - n2. 23. a. U sing the distance formula determines the length of the line. Simply put, this formula derives from the Pythagorean theorem by creating a right triangle between any two points. The length of each leg of this triangle can be found by nding the difference of the two x-coordinates and the difference of the two y-coordinates. Now square each of these values, add the two values together, and then take the square root of this sum. This is the distance between two points. In this case, the distance is given as 13, so the sum of the squares of the differences in the x and y coordinates must total 169. The point (1,13) creates a difference of 5 in the x value and a difference of 12 in the y value; the squares of these values are 25 and 144, which add up to 169. 24. j. T his sequence is actually two different sequences merged into one sequence. The odd terms are a geometric sequence with a ratio of 2. The even terms are an arithmetic sequence with a difference of -4. Since the next term would be the seventh term, simply multiply the fth term times two. 25. b. U se trial and error to test each of the possi- ble lowest integers offered as solutions. By star ting with 12, a set of 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 is created. The sum of the elements of this set is 102. 26. h. W orking backward from an area of 6.25U in.2 by using the formula area = Ur2, we can determine that the radius of the original circle is 2.5. Doubled, the new radius is 5, and 25U in. 2 is the new area. 27. d. T o solve, plug in the coordinates of the ver - tex, (3,-2), into the equations provided and d etermine which equation is made true by these coordinates. In this case, -2 = (3 - 3)2 - 2, so choice d is correct. 28. f. T o solve, nd a value for x that creates a value of zero in the denominator, and thus an undened equation. Factor the denomi-nator into (x + 9)(x - 2), and the two solu- tions for x are -9 and +2. 29. b. If r = 30, then 30% of r is equal to 9. If 75% 75of s is equal to 9, then 9 = , and by cross s 100 multiplying and then dividing by 75 we nd that s is equal to 12; 50% of 12 is 6. 30. k. F or a line to be perpendicular to another line, their slopes must be negative recipro-cals, or when multiplied their slopes create a p roduct of -1. Therefore, the slope of a line perpendicular to a line with a slope of 2 3 must have a slope of -3 2. 31. c. I f the job takes 8 people 12 hours each, then 96 hours of labor are required; thus 6 people would have to work 16 hours each. 32. h. A cub e has six congruent faces, therefore each face must have an area of 384 divided by 6, or 64 cm 2. Because each face is a square, the sides of the square, and thus the cube, must be 8 cm, and the volume must be 8 3, or 512 cm3. 312 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 33. d. I f the volume has decreased by 20%, then 80% of the original volume remains, and the question is solved by the proportion 240 80 = . x 100 34. j. T he area of the shaded region can be found by nding the difference between the area of the larger circle and the area of the smaller 2circle. The area of a circle is equal to Ur . Using r = 7 for the larger circle and r = 3.5 (half of 7) for the smaller circle, we nd their areas to be 49U and 12.25U, respec - tively. The difference is 36.75U. 35. e. T o solve, factor 2xy - 4x into 2x (y - 2). This indicates that any time that y, or the second term, is equal to 2, the expression will have a value of 0. In all three instances given the second term can have a value of 2, so in all three instances the expression could have a value of 0. 36. h. U se the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the third side of the triangle by solving 26 2 - 102 = x2. In this case, x will equal 24, and the third side of the triangle has a measure of 24 units (you might also have recalled the Pythagorean triple of 5-12-13, which when doubled is 10-24-26). tan C is found by opposite/adjacent, or 24, which 10 is 2.4. 237. a. B y factoring both x y2 and xy3, we nd the 2greatest common factor to be xy2. Thus xy = 45.The only perfect square that is a factor of 45 is 9, and y must therefore be equal to 3. 38. h. W orking backward, if $54 is 25%, or 1 of the 4 money spent on food, then the money spent on food totals $216. Continuing, this amount represents 18% of the budget, so the entire budget, x, can be found using the pro- 18 216portion = . By cross multiplying and 100 x then dividing by 18, x equals 1,200, and the budget must be $1,200. 39. a. Let r = radiation and d = distance; in this case, using inverse variation we know that rd2 = k, where k is a constant. When d = 1, r would be equal to k. If r were to be reduced by 1, then d2 has to equal 16 in order to keep 16 k constant. Thus d equals 4. 40. h. Fir st, because line OA is congruent to line OB, then angle B is congruent to angle A. These two angles total 110\u00b0, meaning the third angle of the triangle is 70\u00b0. This is the angle that intercepts the arc in question, and because it is a central angle (an angle whose vertex is the center of a circle), the measure of the intercepted arc is equal to the measure of that angle. 41. a. T he maximum value of sin is 1, which is attained at an angle of 90\u00b0, so 2x must equal 90\u00b0, and x must equal 45\u00b0. Because a circle contains 360 o, or 2U, U is the equivalent of 45\u00b0. 4 42. f. tan A is found by dividing the opposite, or y, side of the triangle by the adjacent, or x, side of the triangle. Because angle A is in the sec-ond quadrant (between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0), then c os A, found by dividing the adjacent side by the hypotenuse, would also be negative, because x is negative in the second quadrant. The third side of the right triangle in ques-tion would be 5, because it is the hypotenuse o f a 3-4-5 triangle. cos A would equal the adjacent side of the angle, or -4, over the hypotenuse, or 5. 43. e. T he area of the circle, Ur2, would be 81U. The area of a sector of a circle, relative to the entire area of a circle, is proportional to the ratio between the central angle that creates 120s that sector and 360\u00b0. Because s equals 1 3,360 the area of the sector would be 1 3 the total area. 44. k. Fir st, substitute 69 for f(x) and solve for x. If 69 = 3(x2 - 2), rst divide both sides by 3, and then add 2 to both sides. Thus x2 = 25, and x = 5 or -5. Plug those values into the equation 2x - 3. The answers are 7 or -13. 313 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 2 45. b. 3The expression w can be read as \"the cube 1 2root of w squared.\" If w = , then w8 = 1 64, and the cube root of 1 is 1 64 4. 46. g. The area of the shaded region can be found by nding the difference between the area of the outer circle and the area of the inner cir - cle. The outer circle has a radius of 1.2(5), or 6, and thus has an area of 36U; the area of the inner circle is 25U. The shaded region therefore has an area of 11U. 47. d. If the arc length is 9U inches, the circumfer - ence is therefore 72U inches. Since circum- ference, C , is equal to 2Ur, 72 must equal 2r, and r equals 36. 48. j. Fir st, use trial and error to factor the equa- tion, keeping in mind that the rst terms of the fa ctors must be 5x and x, the second terms of the factors must have a product of 4, and the terms in both cases must be sepa- rated by a minus sign to produce the nega- tive middle term of the original trinomial. T he equation factors to (5x - 4)(x - 1); now, set each factor equal to zero and solve for x. 49. c. c os equals adjacent/hypotenuse, so the trian- gle has a hypotenuse of 9 and the side adja-cent to angle x has length 8. Because sin e quals opposite/hypotenuse, we need to determine the length of the remaining leg. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we nd that this leg has length 17. So, the sine of x is 17 .9 50. g. The problem can be solved two ways. First, systematically move clockwise from one ver - tex to the next and connect each vertex to all othe rs. There will be 14 lines drawn. To solve this mathematically, notice the pattern from the other two polygons. Take the number of vertices and multiply that times the number of diagonals that can be drawn from each vertex; in the square, this is 4 times 1, in the pentagon this is 5 times 2. Then take the resulting product and divide by 2; for the square, the answer is 2, and for the pentagon the answer is 5. In both cases, this number represents the total number of distinct diag- onals that can be drawn. For a seven-sided 7 \u00d7 4 gure, the equation would be , which 2 equals 14. 51. d. F or a system of linear equations to have no solution, the lines must be parallel, and in order to be parallel and not be the same line they must have the same slope. The slope of a graphed line is - 4, found by taking the 5 change in the two y terms and dividing it by the change in the two x terms. The standard-form equation 5y + 4x = -4, when put into slope/intercept form y = mx + b (m = slope), also has a slope of - 4 5. 52. j. T here are four ways the lines can be drawn: as three parallel lines, as two parallel lines and a third line intersecting both, as three lines intersecting at one point, and as lines intersecting at three different points. The rst case creates four regions, the next two cases each create six regions, and the nal case creates seven regions. 314 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 53. d. The problem is easier than it might seem. 58. j. The line y = x starts in the third quadrant, Since the geometric sequence goes from x to has a slope of 1, goes through the origin, and xy, the common ratio between terms must continues into the rst quadrant. Therefore, be y. For each of the ensuing terms the y the point (5,-7), which is in the fourth would simply be raised to the next power, quadrant, would be reflected in the second and since the second term contains y to the quadrant, and the x and y coordinates would 54. f. rst power, the 97th term would contain y to the 96th power. Because a logarithm is the inverse operation 59. d. be reversed. Volume of a cylinder is found with the for - mula V = Ur2h, where h is the height of the of an exponential expression, log3243 can be cylinder. If the radius of the cylinder is 4, read as \"3 to what power equals 243.\" The and we plug that value into the formula for 55. c. answer is 5. First, apply the Pythagorean theorem to the volume, we can solve for the height, which equals 10. Because the edge of the cube is right triangle in question. This tells us that A2 + B2 = C2, where A and B are legs of the triangle and C is the hypotenuse. So (2x)2 + 2(5x)2 = C2, and 29x = C2. Now simply take 60. h. half this measure, the edge is 5, and the cube has a volume of 53 or 125 square units. The measure of the missing side can be found by subtracting 4 2 from 102; the miss- 56. k. the square root of both sides to solve for C. This is a classic combination problem and is ing side is 84 , or 2 21. The value of sin C is opposite over hypotenuse, or 2 21 over solved using multiplication. There are three 10.

F rankenstein asks his listener to [l]earn from me . . . how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge (lines 9-11). He is telling his tale as a warning and does not want to lead his listener into the same kind of destruction and infallible misery (lines 8-9). 12. f. T he context reveals that Frankenstein was prepared for a multitude of reverses or set- backs that would hinder his operations. 13. d. F rankenstein describes himself as pursuing his undertaking with unremitting ardor and that his cheek had grown pale with study, and [his] person had become emaciated with con-nement (lines 67-70). He also says that a r esistless, and almost frantic, impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit (lines 83-86). These are the marks of a man obsessed. 14. g. M oreau states in lines 33-36 that this extraordinary branch of knowledge has never been sought as an end, [ . . . ] until I took it up!, and later adds that he was the rst man to take up this question armed with antiseptic surgery, and with a really scientic knowledge of the laws of growth (lines 43-46). This, and the detail with which he explains the back- ground of his investigations, reveals that he is a calculat ing and systematic scientist. 15. d. R ight after he says these things, the narrator says these animals to clarify that he is refer - ring to the creatures that Moreau created. A n additional context clue is provided by Moreau's response, in which he explains how animals may be educated so that they may talk. 16. g. T he narrator asks Moreau to justify all this pain (lines 82-83), implying that he has inflicted great pain on the animals he has used in his experiments. 17. c. B oth men make remarkable discoveries in their elds; in the other aspects the men are different. Dr. Moreau uses live animals to change their form, and there is no evidence in the passage that he wants his creatures to worship him or that he has kept his experi- ment a secret. Passage 2 also suggests that M oreau did not have a specic application or justication for his work; he responds to the narrator's request for a justication by philosophizing about pain. 316 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 18. f.

The three examples in the rst paragraph show that there is a wide range of styles of public art in New York City and that public art can be found in a variety of places, including more mundane locations such as the subway and post ofce. 32. f. Inherently is an adverb that describes the essential nature of something. The context clue to answer this question is found in the same sentence. A ll art is inherently public because it is created in order to convey an idea or emotion to others. The author is saying that an essential characteristic of art is that it is created for others. 33. b. Paragraph 2 denes public art as the kind of art created for and displayed in public spaces, and lines 30-32 in paragraph 3 state that public art is specically designed for a public arena where the art will be encountered by people in their normal day-to-day activities. This is in contrast to private art, which is less accessible because it is kept in specic, non- public places such as private museums and galleries. 34. g. To s equester is to seclude or isolate. Thus the use of this word suggests that the author feels private art is too isolated and cut off from the public. 35. d. The many functions are listed in paragraph 5: educating, place making, stimulating the public, promoting community, beautifying, and regenerating. While promoting good citizenship may be a side benet of public art, it is not discussed in the passage. 36. f. After dening public art, the rest of the pas-sage discusses the functions of public art and its impact on the city. 37. d. The examples in the rst paragraph and the list of different kinds of public art will make readers more aware of public art; paragraphs 2 and 3 explain the difference between pub- lic and private art; paragraph 5 explains how public art affects the community; and para- graph 6 discusses how public art should be created. A few readers may be inspired to create public art after reading this passage, but that is not one of its goals. 38. h. Although the opening of paragraph 2 states that There exists in every city a symbiotic rela- tionship between the city and its art, and paragraph 5 explains how public art affects the city, there is no discussion of how the city affects art. 39. b. Because the main purpose is to show what public art is and how public art affects the city, the passage would be best served by an expanded discussion of how public art ful- lls each of the important functions in paragraph 5. 40. g. While the passage addresses all of the choices, the overall theme, cited at the end of paragraph 2 (there is a growing interest in, and respect for, public art) is the growing importance of and interest in public art.

Passage II\u2014Research Summary 8. h. T he concentration in the cell is 1.5%, so it is stronger than the 1% solution and weaker than the 2% and 5% solutions. It will draw in water to balance the 1% (deplasmolysis) and lose water to balance the others (plas- molysis). Higher differentials in concentra- tion cause higher osmotic pressure and higher rates of osmosis. 319 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 9. d. T he relationship between the solution sur - rounding the cell and the cell is hypotonic if the s urrounding fluid is lower in concentra- tion, isotonic if it is of equal concentration, and h ypertonic if it has a greater concentra- tion. P lasmolytic and deplasmolytic (choice a) are terms that are not dened in the pas- sage. They refer to the state of the cell, not the r elationship of the solutions. Hyper - and hypo-osmotic were also not used in the pas-sage. They refer to the fluid relationship fr om the standpoint of the internal cell fluid, not the external fluid. Hypo-osmotic, hypo- osmotic, and hyperosmotic is a correct deni-tion of the cells in relation to the three test fluids, but answer choice b as stated is not. 10. f. T he test solution causes deplasmolysis (water entering the cell) when its concentra- tion is lower than the cell's and plasmolysis (wat er drawn out of the cells) when its con- centration is higher. Therefore, the cell's c oncentration must be higher than the con- centrations that cause deplasmolysis and lo wer than the concentrations that cause plasmolysis; 1.8% is the only possible answer. 11. c. W ater would be drawn out of the cells by the surrounding hypertonic (higher- concentration) solution, resulting in plasmolysis. 12. g. T he distilled water, with a solute concentra- tion of 0%, is extremely hypotonic. Water w ill ll the cells. This is called deplasmolysis. 13. c. T his is a case where the correct answer may seem extreme or absurd to those not familiar with the phenomenon. It is, however, the only answer consistent with the scientic principles presented. The others are all demonstrably impossible. Since sucrose can- not leave the cell, the distilled water mixture w ill always be hypotonic and never become isotonic as long as the cell membranes are intact. Water will be drawn into the cell until the cell walls can no longer expand. At that point they will burst. This is not merely a logical conclusion; it actually happens to cells in extremely isotonic environments. Some protozoa avoid this fate by having mechanisms to squirt out excess water. Most plant cells do not. Answer choice a is not correct for the reason just given. Answer choices b and d are not correct because plasmolysis can occur only when there is a higher-concentration solution outside the cell than inside. Passage III\u2014Research Summary 14. g. B oth charges are positive, so the force between them will be repulsive, not attrac-tive. Sphere A is held down by the force of g ravity, which is approximately 10 gm/s2. When sphere B is close enough so that the repulsive force exceeds 10 gm/s 2, sphere A moves. Answer choices f and j are incorrect because sphere B is repelling sphere A upward, not attracting it downward. Answer choice c is incorrect because sparks do not fly between like-charged objects. 320 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 15. b. T he weight of sphere A is still 1 gram, so the same force will be required to move it. Nei- ther F nor k have changed between experi-ments, so we can ignore them in this c omparison. By Coulomb's law, F is propor- Q \u00d7 Q1 2tional to . In the original experiment 2d 1, this was as follows: \u00d7 1 11 = 102 100 Now, the charge on each sphere is 2, but we do not know the distance, so we can write the following formula: 1 \u00d72 2 = 2 100 d 1 4 = 2 100 d d2 = 4100 d2 = 400 d = 20 16. f. T he charges are opposite, which means sphere A will be attracted down toward sphere B, but the strings will prevent it from moving downward until sphere B physically moves sphere A with kinetic force. 17. b. T he charges are opposite, which means sphere B will push sphere A away from it downward. The strings, however, will pre-vent sphere A from moving. 18. f. T he charge is the same magnitude as in the rst version of experiment 1, but the prod-uct of the two charges is negative, not posi-tive. That means that sphere B will pull sp here A up toward it, not push it away. The distance at which the force will overcome the gravitational force on sphere A is the same as in experiment 1. 19. d. T his can be calculated as was done for ques- tion 15, but no calculation is necessary in this case. The description of experiment 1 established that if both charges = 1, the force of the charge will overcome the force of gravity at 10 cm. It is also known that the greater the charge is, the greater the force will be at any given distance. Therefore, the distance at which charges of 2 and 3 will overcome gravity must be greater than the distance for charges of 1 and 1. The only answer greater than 10 cm is choice d. Passage IV\u2014Research Summary 20. g. A ccording to the formula, the distance to the epicenter is 15 s \u00d7 8 km/s or 120 km. 21. d. Ea ch circle represents the approximate dis- tance from one of the stations to the epicen-ter. The place where all three circles come c losest to intersecting is the estimated location of the epicenter. 22. f. T he other times listed are the times at which the P wave reached each seismographic sta- tion, respectively. The earthquake had to ha ve started earlier. Specically, the calcu- lated distance of the epicenter from station A is 120 km. The passage states that P waves travel at approximately 8 km/s, so the earth- quake started 15 seconds before the P wave r eached station A, or 05:32:55. 23. c. A ccording to the formula, the distance to the epicenter is 10 s \u00d7 8 km/s or 80 km. 24. j. T he P wave is reported to arrive at the same time at stations A and C, but the S wave arrives 70 seconds later at C than A. This would, at minimum, require a very extraor - dinary geological situation. Also, even thoug h the rule of thumb provided may not hold for station C, if it is anywhere close to being accurate, the distances to the epicenter computed for the three stations cannot intersect at anything close to a single point. 321 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 25. d. A ccording to the method provided in the passage for estimating distances from a seis- mic reading to the epicenter, the wave veloci- ties provided for P and S waves function o nly up to 500 km, but the estimate by that method would be 640 km to the epicenter. No information is given as to whether the distance should be estimated to be either greater than or less than 640 km. Passage V\u2014Data Representation 26. h. C ompound A and compound D give up H's, so they are acids. Compounds B and C receive H's, so they are bases. Answer choice h correctly pairs the acid compound A with the base compound C and the acid com- pound D with the base compound B because those ar e the pairs that transform into each other by gaining or losing an H. Answer choice f reverses the acid/base order for the second pair. Answer choice g does not pair the conjugates. Answer choice j reverses the acid/base order for the rst pair. 27. a. W ith the indicated changes, compound D would have to become H3O to preserve the correct number of atoms of each element. The resulting conjugates are as in answer choice a. Answer choice b gives the correct conjugates for this line without the changes asked for. Answer choice c mismatches the conjugate pairs. Answer choice d gives the wrong acid/base order for the second pair. 28. g. T hose are the compounds that give up hydrogen ions in the reactions shown. 29. d. T hose are the compounds that accept hydro- gen ions in the reactions shown. 30. h. T his is a functional denition, not a xed denition, based on the composition of each compound. Answer choice f is clearly not true. Answer choice g is not indicated any- where in the passage and does not explain the diff erent roles some compounds play. Answer choice j is a fair statement. In fact, some denitions of acids and bases rely entirely on the question of electrons accepted or given up. The statement does not characterize this denition, though. Passage VI\u2014Data Representation 31. c. A s the drawing indicates, the side of the magnetosphere facing the sun follows a pat- tern similar to that of a normal dipole. The sid e away from the sun, however, sweeps away from the earth as if driven by a strong wind. That is the effect of the solar wind. Answer choice a is not really accurate. The lines of force, representing equivalent mag-netic strength, are swept away from the sun, b ut the magnetosphere extends indenitely in all directions, as does the magnetic eld of the handheld dipole. Answer choice b is incorrect. Magnetic elds do not really have a measurable size. They become weaker and weaker as they get farther from their magnet, but there is no point at which they entirely disappear. Answer choice d is not directly related to shape. It is also ambiguous. As is clear from the fact that a small handheld magnet will act more forcefully on a com- pass needle than will the earth's magnetic e ld, the intensity of the earth's magnetic eld is much less than that of anything we would recognize as a magnet. 32. j.

ACT Writing Practice Test 4 Sample \"Score 6\" Essay Obesity has become a major problemin the United States. This health problem leads to other seriousissues such as heart disease and dia-betes. The school board is consider-ing a plan to help students fight thisproblem. The new lunch programbased on nutritious food and the elimination of soda machines is nec-essary for students to obtain nutri-tious food, and the program will helpstudents become healthier, more ener- getic, and even smarter. Many students in our schools have a weight problem. More and more children and teenagers are battling obe-sity than ever before. Much of this isdue to poor food choices. At home,many families have two parents whowork or even just one parent whoworks two jobs. This leaves littletime for shopping for and preparingnutritious meals. It's simply quickerand easier to go to a fast-food res- taurant or throw some macaroni and cheese into the microwave than to prepare a well-balanced meal. That'swhere the school comes in. At least the school can provide students witha nutritious lunch. It may be theonly really nutritious food the stu-dents get. While there might be some resistance at first, students will eventually begin to eat and enjoy thenew food. If students become hungry enough, they'll try it and find that they actually like it. They will begin to feel and look better. The soda machines do provide money for theschool, but is the money worth thehealth of the students? Additionally,if we replace the soda vendingmachines with water vending machines,we will still make some money. Eating healthy lunches will help students have more energy throughoutthe day. Students and teachers com-plain that many students tend tocrash during the early afternoonclasses. This is usually becausestudents have eaten a lunch high insugar and carbohydrates. This type offood gives a quick burst of energy,which the student typically uses upduring the period itself, and thencauses a rapid decline of energy,causing the student to feel sluggishand sleepy. Nutritious food wouldeliminate this problem. If studentseat a meal of protein, whole grains,and vegetables, they will have asteadier supply of energy to keep them going throughout the day. Some oppo- nents say that many students will boycott the new lunch program andnot eat lunch at all, making them tiredduring the day. This may happen a fewtimes, but most teenagers do not likethe feeling of being hungry and tired. 324 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 They will eventually begin to eat the food, even if it's just one part of thelunch that they like. Finally, this new lunch program will actually help students increasetheir academic performance. Healthyfood makes people feel better and per- form with more energy and alertness.This means students will pay moreattention in class, have more energy todo required work, and think moreclearly and creatively. This can onlylead to better grades and better testscores, something students andteachers alike are always pursuing. The new lunch program may intimidate some students. People arecreatures of habit and are initiallyresistant to change of any kind. Butmuch of eating is an acquired tastefor certain foods. While students may miss their tacos and chocolate chipcookies, they will eventually come toappreciate and hopefully prefer grilledchicken and a nice juicy apple. Critique This essay shows an excellent and insightful under - standing of the prompt. The writer takes a clear stand o n the issue with a strong, direct thesis statement: The new lunch program based on nutritious food and the elimination of soda machines is necessary for stu- dents to obtain nutritious food, and the program will he lp students become healthier, more energetic, and even smarter. The essay is well developed with specic examples, reasons, and sound logic. It contains two counterarguments in paragraphs 2 and 3, stating that money from the soda machines should not take pre-cedence over student health and that students who b oycott the lunches will eventually begin to eat them. The essay shows excellent command of written lan-guage with sophisticated vocabulary and varied sen-tence structure. Sample \"Score 5\" Essay School cafeterias are not well known for gourmet food, but over the years,they've gotten better at knowing whatteenagers like to eat. Now the schoolwants to change all that by starting anew lunch program with nutritiousfood and eliminating the sodamachines. Doing this will actuallyharm the students and waste a lot of money. Lunch is one of the most impor- tant parts of a student's day atschool. It's a time when students can relax and have fun. Part of that fun is enjoying the food. Studentshave their likes and dislikes, but usu-ally there's something they will eat,even if it's just the packages ofchocolate chip cookies that everyonelikes so much. The point is to havesomething in the middle of the daythat will give students some energy tomake it through the rest of the day.It doesn't need to be a full meal of chicken, vegetables, and whole-grainrolls. Teenagers are picky about theirfood and they are also a little rebel- lious. If the school offers only food that many teens don't like, they justwon't eat it. Then many students willbe trying to make it through the daywithout lunch. Many students do noteat breakfast, so now they will havemissed two meals. This could lead to students fainting or losing a lot ofweight, which could also be danger-ous. If the students do eat the full meals presented in the cafeteria, this 325 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 could also be a problem. The lunches we have now are light food\u2014sand-wiches, tacos. If students eat a full meal and then go right out to playgym, they could get sick. Having a program like this will also waste a lot of money. We allknow that better food costs more money to buy and takes more skill toprepare. The school will have toincrease its food budget and possiblyhire different people to prepare thefood. All this money will go to wastebecause most of the students won't eat the food. Burgers and tacos maynot be the healthiest foods but theyalso don't cost very much and teenag- ers will actually eat them. Eliminating the soda machines will also cost the school a lot of money. The moneyfrom those machines goes towardschool supplies that benefit the stu- dents. So once again, if we have this new lunch program students are beingharmed. Yes, we could replace thesoda machines with water machines, but they will definitely not generate asmuch income and students will have to sacrifice things such as sportsequipment, uniforms, or art supplies. People will say that the school has a responsibility to provide nutri-tious food for the students. First of all, burgers and tacos do have nutri-tion; it's not like students are eatingnothing but candy for lunch. Sec-ondly, we're only talking about onemeal a day; many students get verynutritious food at home. One meal is not going to make that muchdifference. This new lunch program could do more harm than good. I appreciate theschool trying to make studentshealthier, but that really is a personalchoice and the responsibility of stu- dents and their parents. The school should concentrate on educating stu- dents, not trying to change their diets. Critique This essay shows a good understanding of the p rompt, and the writer takes a strong stand on the issue. The essay is well developed with the exception of paragraph 4, which contains only a counterargu- ment and could have been developed a bit more to mak e the essay more balanced. The essay gives spe- cic examples and is logically sound. The writing sho ws a strong command of written language but lacks some of the sophistication of the model score 6 essay.

Some people think that thestudents won't eat this food, but that's not really a problem. If theteenager is overweight, skipping a mealmight not be a bad idea. Getting rid of the soda machines is also a good idea. I know theschool makes some money off ofthem so losing the money would bebad, but not having soda around all thetime would be more healthy. I hadthree cavities last year and I thinkit's mostly because I drink so muchsoda. I definitely think a healthier lunch program is a good idea. It maytake some getting used too but Ithink it will be better for everyone inthe long run. Critique This essay shows a good understanding of the p rompt, and the writer takes a strong stand on the issue. The introduction is somewhat of a restatement of the prompt, but it works. The essay lacks some development. It's only four paragraphs in length, and the writer focuses a bit too much on personal issues related to the topic (cavities due to drinking soda). The writing shows a good command of written lan-guage but lacks sophistication. Sample \"Score 3\" Essay The school board is considering changing the school lunch program sothat all the food is low-fat. They arealso interested in getting rid of all the soda machines. I think this is a terri-ble idea. No one likes low-fat food, espe- cially teenagers. We like to eat junkfood. We have to eat enough healthyfood at home, we don't need it pushedon us at school. Actually I don'teven think the food at school is that unhealthy. It's not like it's fast foodor anything. OK, there's burgers, buttheir not all greasy or anything. If weget low fat food no one will eat it.No one wants to eat whole grain pitaswith tuna in them. I've tried low-fat cookies and they were terrible. Theytasted like cardboard. As far as getting rid of the soda machines, that will cause a big prob- lem. We all like to drink soda. It's refreshing and picks us up in theafternoons. Also the soda machines make money for the school. We getsupplies and stuff from that money.I think the students will probablyrebel if we get rid of the sodamachines or you'll have a bunch ofpeople cutting just to get to thestore to buy some soda. This program is a bad idea. I wouldn't put it in, but if you dowatch out because the students and probably even some teachers are notgoing to like it. Critique This essay shows a basic understanding of the p rompt, and the writer takes a clear stand on the issue. It is undeveloped, as it is only four paragraphs. This essay focuses on the writer's personal dislike of eating healthy foods, as well as what will happen if the plan is implemented, rather than citing specic, 327 - - ACT PRACTICE BATTERY 4 logical reasons for not implementing the plan. The writing shows some command of written language, but it is very casual and unsophisticated. Sample \"Score 2\" Essay I think the school should maybe go into a healthier lunch plan. I alsothink that the soda machines should also be out. The soda machines never work anyway. I loose so much money inthem. Or if I don't loose the moneyI get the wrong soda. So I don't careif those go away. The lunches are pretty bad. All we eat is hamburgers, tacos and somekids only eat chips and cookies forlunch. Thats pretty bad and I can seethat a lot of people need to looseweight too. The new lunch plan mighthelp people eat better and looseweight. But it would be hard to always eat healthy food. Everyone likes a treatonce in awhile so maybe a totallyhealthy lunch might not be so great. Critique This essay shows a weak understanding of the p rompt. It does not take a very clear stand on the issue because, although the writer makes a clear state-ment about wanting the new lunch program in the int roduction, the essay drifts off focus by discussing the fact that the writer loses money in the soda machines. In addition, in the conclusion, the writer says that the new program might not be so great. The essay is very undeveloped and lacks logical reasoning. The writing shows some grasp of written language, but it is very unsophisticated and contains spelling and grammatical errors that make some of the essay difcult to understand. Sample \"Score 1\" Essay There are good and bad things aboutthe new lunch plan. Its always a goodidear to eat better but ususually itsnot that fun. So the school should think about it before they do it. Most kids and adults like soda. No one really likes to drink water, butthey will if that's all there is so ifthe soda machines go out and theresonly water that would be good. But ifyou do that the water fountians needfi[ing theyre always broken or actuallyits kind of dirty so maybe we shouldnot use them and just go back to thesoda machine. Im not really shure what the best thing is. Well the best thing isto eat healthy and not drink soda butwhose really gonna do that. Critique This essay shows a lack of understanding of the p rompt and does not take a stand on the issue at all. The body of the essay drifts off topic by focusing on the condition of the water fountains. The writer admits in the conclusion that he or she is not sure what to think of the issue. The writing shows a poor grasp of written language, and there are many spell-ing and grammatical errors that make much of the essa y difcult to understand. 328 CHAPTER6 SCORING YOUR ACT PRACTICE TESTS The way that ACT reviewers arrive at your ofcial test scores is more complicated than just adding up your correct answers. The rst thing they do is take the number of correct answers on each test and then convert them to scaled scores, which allow each test, regardless of the number of questions, to have the same range, 1 being the lowest and 36 being the highest. The composite score is the average of all four mul- tiple-choice scaled scores, rounded off to the nearest whole number. If you take the optional Writing test, you will receive two additional scores beyond what you would receive if you took only the ACT multiple-choice tests. Y ou must take both the English and Writing tests to receive writing scores. Y ou will receive a Writing test subscore and a combined English/Writing score, plus comments about your essay. The combined English/Writing test score is created by using a formula that weighs the English test score as two-thirds of the total and the Writing test score as one-third of the total to form a combined score. This combined score is reported on a 1-36 scale, 1 being the lowest and 36 being the highest. I f you'd like approximate ACT-like scaled scores for the individual practice tests in this book, as well as a composite score for each of the practice batteries, you can follow these simple steps. Remember, however, that the scores you earn here are only an approximation of what you might earn on your ofcial ACT. 329 - - SCORING YOUR ACT PRACTICE TESTS Scoring the Four Multiple- Choice P ractice T ests Chapters 2 through 5 in this book each contain a full battery of ACT practice tests\u2014the four multiple-choice tests (English, Mathematics, Reading, and Sci- ence), as well as an optional Writing practice test. The r st step for each practice battery is to nd your indi- vidual scores on the multiple-choice tests. You must rst nd your raw score for each m ultiple-choice test. Y our raw score is simply the number of questions on each test that you answered correctly. Remember, on the ACT there is no penalty for guessing, so don't subtract any points for ques-tions you answered incorrectly. Use the following Multiple-Choice Scale Score C onversion Chart to help compute your scaled scores. Y ou must take the raw score for a test, multiply it by 36, divide that product by the number of test ques-tions, and then either add or subtract a specic a djustment number provided to you in the chart. If the nal number you arrive at for your scaled score isn't a whole number, it be should rounded to the nearest whole number; so, for example, 34.5 should be rounded up to 35; 29.3 should be rounded down to 29.

To begin, look at the fol- lowing scoring rubric. To determine your score, sim-ply refer to the categories on the rubric to see how y our writing measures up. If you have difculty gur - ing out your score, ask someone knowledgeable, such as a teacher, counselor, writing coach, or college pro- fessor, to help you. If this is not an option, you can refer to the sample essays (at each ACT score level: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1) included for each practice prompt. Y ou can use these as benchmarks to compare and contrast your writing. Each model response at every scoring level is a ccompanied by a critique. The critique will help you see the strengths and weaknesses of the response. Y ou will be able to understand what the ACT writing scor - ers are looking for\u2014both pitfalls to avoid in your o wn response and the signs of good writing.
