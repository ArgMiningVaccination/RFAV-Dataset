Introduction of New DUR Board Members Ms. Judith Clark welcomed new members and conducted introductions. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 5 O ld Business: The m otion for approval of the minutes was made by Dr. Hubble and seconded by Dr. Proctor received unanimous approv al. Dr. Banahan provided feedback to the board about actions taken from previous board recommendations. During the August meeting, MS- DUR presented i nformation on Synagis utilization during the 2014- 15 season and indicated th at MS -DUR was working on an outcomes based report . Due to the small sample size and limitations in identifying at risk children using claims data it was determined that an outcomes analysis could not be completed . In September 2015 the DUR Board recommended that the Pharmacy &Therapeutics (P&T) Committee change triazolam and methadone to non- preferred status on the MS DOM preferred drug list. T he P&T Committee approved this recommendation and MS - DUR conducted an educational mailing to notify prescribers of the change . Dr. Banahan reviewed other educational mailings currently in progress that ad dress high morphine equivalent doses and doctor shopping, adherenc e to chronic medications , metab olic monitoring related to antipsychotic use in children, and ADHD treatment follow- up care in children. The recent update to the Cough and Cold Quick List was mail ed to high utilization prescribers of these products. Dr. Noble updated the board on the cl inical edit and the manual prior authorization ( PA) process being implemented when a third antipsychotic is prescribed. Resource Utilization Review : Dr. Banahan stated that the analysis of utilization among F ee-For-S ervice (FFS) and the two C oordinated Care Organizations (CCO s) noted no major exceptions . The Board was asked for recommendations regarding a value amount to use for high cost prescription s in order to separat e these high cost products from other products in the resource reports. After discus sion, Mr. Smith recommended a cut off of $1500 per claim. Ms. Clark asked that MS- DUR begin with carving out hemophilia factor and to add the numbe r of claims and number of unique beneficiaries in the top product reports. Pharmacy Program Update: Ms. Clark suggested that the DUR Board consider adopting a procedure which would allow for the co- chair to be mentored by the current DUR Board chair. This would allow for succession planning provided that the term limits of the co -chair allow this member's par ticipation after the next election . Dr. McIntosh made a motion that Mr. Smith remain as chair and Dr. Wales be co -chair. The motion was seconded by Dr. Hubble and passed unanimously. Ms. Clark reviewed major items related to pharmacy that will be included in the December Provider Bulletin . A major update in the Universal Preferred Drug List ( UPDL ) will become effective January 1, 2016. Additionally, Division of Medicaid (DOM) will add varicella vaccine to the adult vaccines covered through pharmacy services on January 1, 2016. Feedback and Discussion from the Board Mr. Smith asked that MS -DUR consider a review of respiratory care agents and impact due to guideline changes for short -acting and long- acting beta agonists that occurred in April 2015. Dr. Hubble reported it has been difficult getting Pulmicort for infants less than 12 months of age since it is n ot an FDA approved indication. She noted that it is the only agent with nebulizer. Ms. Clark asked the board about prob lems with opiate use and the need for DOM to re consider current parameters and recommendations for \"lock -in\" program regarding beneficiaries utilizing multiple pharmac ies and Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 6p rescribers for opiate s. Drs. Proctor and Rick reported that pain management contracts require patients to use on ly one pharmacy except in emergency situations. It was reported that p ain management clinics monitor th e use of multiple pharmacies closely. Several members of the Board commented that five pharmacies was too many for patients to be allowed to use for opiates prior to being \"lock ed-in\". Members from the DUR Board expressed a strong belief that use of one pharmacy was sufficient for beneficiaries in lock -in for suspicious use of opiates , with the understanding that speci al circumstances will require the use of a second pharmacy occasionally . New Business: Jadenu / Exjade Utilization and Costs Dr. Banahan provided an overview of the MS-DUR analysis of Jadenu and Exjade utilization and costs . Results indicated that ut ilization of deferasirox has increased significantly with the introduction of Jadenu but there was no indication of inappropriate use. T he Board concurred with the recommendation that MS -DUR continue to monitor use of these products to see where utilizatio n levels off but no action was needed at this time. Daraprim Price Increase and Utilization Dr. Banahan reported that when Turing Pharmaceuticals bought Daraprim from Impax Laboratories in August 2015, the company immediately raised the price of one pill from $13.50 to $750. As a result of this action, MS- DUR conducted an analysis of Daraprim utilization and the estimated impact of the price increase to DOM . Results indicated that current utilization is appropriate and a lthough the price increase will r esult in a major increase in the amount DOM pays to pharmacies for Daraprim therapy, the net impact on DOM may be an actual reduction in net cost due to mandatory Federal rebate guidelines. The Board agreed that no actions were needed at this time. Changes in Mental Health Medication Use Among Children Transitioning From Fee- for-Service (FFS) to Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) Dr. Banahan informed the board that during the August 2015 P&T Committee meeting a committee member expressed concerns that children were not being allowed to remain on multiple stimulants when transitioning to coordinated care organizations (CCOs). Results of an analysis conducted by MS - DUR indicated that no systematic changes were occurring in the number of agents children were taking before and after transitioning to CCOs. Exceptions Monitoring Criteria Recommendations Dr. Banahan introduced the six new exceptions monitoring criteria that were being proposed. All criteria are based on recent warnings or updates from the Food and Drug Administration. 1. Concomitant administration of Stribild (elvitegravir, Concomitant administration of Etopophos (etoposide with antiepileptic medications. 3. Use of Daytrana (methylphenidate transdermal system) in patients with chemical leukoderma. 4. Co-administration of ACE inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors leading to increased risk of angioedema . 5. Concomitant use of PDE5 Inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors leading to increased risk of hypotension. 6. Proglycem (diazoxide) Capsules and Oral Suspension use in neonates and infants . Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 7 D r. Hubble made a motion that the six new exceptions be approved as a group. The motion was seconded by Dr. Proctor and passed unanimously. Next Meeting Information : Ms. Clark explained that the 2016 schedule for DUR meetings is somewhat different than in the past years due to DOM's desire for the DUR meeting to be conducted prior to the P& T Committee . This would allow DUR Board r ecommendations to be shared with the P&T Committee during the same quarter. M r. Smith announced that the next meeting date is January 21, 2016 at 2:00p.m. He thanked everyone for their attend ance at the DUR Board meeting. Mr. Smith stated that there was good discussion surrounding the agenda and wished everyone a happy holiday. The meeting adjourned at 3:25 pm.

The issue, as summarized by the FDA, is outlined in the excerpt below. http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm463499.htm Tramadol is not FDA -approved for use in children age 17 and younger. Although the FDA safety notice refers to children age 17 and younger, indicated age limits vary by formulation and are not consistently listed by the FDA and various compendia . Microm edex \u00ae (see box below) reports the following age limits: 16 and above - tramadol immediate- release tablets , orally disintegrating tablets, and extended release (Ryzolt TM) 18 and above - tramadol extended- release (Ultram \u00ae ER, ConZip \u00ae) Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 26Clinical Pharmacology (see box below) reports the following age limits: 16 and above - tramadol extended- release tablets (RyzoltTM) 17 and above - tramadol immediate- release tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, and extended -release tablets (RyzoltTM) The Clinical Pharmacology listing mentions RyzoltTM in each reference to extended -release tablets but does not clearly indicate where Ultram \u00ae ER or ConZip \u00ae are included. The prescribing information for Ultram\u00ae ER states in the dosage and administration section that it is for use in adults (18 years of age and older). The prescribing information for Con Zip\u00ae also states that safety and efficacy in patients under 18 years of age have not been established and use in the pediatric population is not recommended. In response to the FDA safety notice, MS -DUR has conducted an analysis of tramadol utilization in children. Utilization was examined by age and formulation in order to evaluate use at all of the potential age limits. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted using pharmacy claims data from J uly 2014 - November 2015 from fee-for-service (FFS) and coordinated care organizations (CCOs) . All claims were extracted for NDCs related to all tramadol formulations . Age and pharmacy program enrollment was determined for beneficiaries at the time each prescription was filled. Prescriptions were classified as being filled for children below the indicated age if age at time of fill was less than 18 years for Ultram\u00ae ER and ConZip \u00ae prescriptions and less than 16 years for all other tramadol formulations. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 27RESULTS Table 1 shows the number of tramadol prescriptions by formulation and age for each pharmacy program. Generic tramadol and generic acetaminophen/tramadol are the preferred product s on the Preferred Drug List (PDL) with branded immediate -release products and all extended - release products being non- preferred. All utilization was for generic products. Tramadol produ cts are included in the product list for the FFS SmartPA Short -acting Narcotics rule but there are no age or product specific edits in place. These data indicate th at the CCOs also do not have age edit in place for use of tramadol.

The FDA has identified safety concerns about tramadol use in an age 17 and under population . The recommended age limit for immediate -release tramadol is unclear: FDA safety notice implies age 18 and above for use Microm edex \u00ae states age 16 and above Clinical Pharmacology states age 17 and above MS-DUR presents the following recommendations for consideration by the DUR Board. 1. The DUR Board recommends that DOM add the following age limits to the Universal Preferred Drug List (UPDL). a. Minimum age limit: 18 years - Ultram \u00ae ER, ConZip \u00ae b. Minimum age limit: 17 years - all other generic and brand formulations of tramadol 2. The DUR Board recommends that DOM add these age limits to the SmartPA Short -acting Narcotics rule used for the FFS program. 3. The DUR Board recommends that DOM share these limitations on the use of tramadol with the coordinated care programs to assure constancy in the pharmacy program. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 30ANTI PSYCHOTIC QUALITY MEASURES : METABOLIC MONITORING IN CHILDREN TAKING ANTIPSYCHOTICS BACKGROUND Increasing concerns regarding obesity and diabetes emergence in children and adolescents1 are heightened for youth prescribed antipsychotic medications due to adverse metabolic and other physical effects .2 A multi -year study of youth enrolled in three health maintenance organizations found that exposure to antipsychotics (AP) was a ssociated with a four -fold increased risk of diabetes in the following year, compared to children not prescribed psychotropic medication3. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) established the Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP), an initiative funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to support the development of new measures in child health care. The National Collaborative for Innovation in Quality Measurement (NCINQ) is the group responsible for developing and proposing measures for inclusion in the Child Core Set used in Medicaid programs. The Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) is a tool used by more than 90 percent of America's health plans to measure performance on important dimensions of care and service. Both of these sources recommend use of quality measures addressing metabolic monitoring in children taking antipsychotics. HEDIS Measure: Metabolic Screening for Children and Adolescents On Antipsychotics. The percentage of children and adolescents 0 -17 of age who had two or more antipsychotic prescriptions and had metabolic screening (during the observation period). NCINQ Proposed Measure for inclusion in Child Core Set: Metabolic Screening for Children and Adolescents on Antipsychotics. The percentage of children 0 to 20 years of age taking any antipsychotic medication who had metabolic screening documented during the measurement year. At the November 2014 DUR Board Meeting, MS -DUR presented an analysis that showed that during the period July 2013 to June 2014 only 13% of chil dren and adolescents enrolled in Mississippi Medicaid taking antipsychotic medications had claim s documenting blood glucose and cholesterol tests had been performed during the observation year. 1 Eisenmann JC.

Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 31 Unfortunately, since there was no quorum at the November 2014 DUR board meeting, there was no vote and recommendations were tabled until the February 2015 meeting. During the February 2015 meeting, the DUR Board recommended that MS -DUR initiate an educational intervention to notify prescribers of the need for metabolic monitoring, evaluate the impact of the intervention, and report back to the Board for consideration of further ac tions that might be needed to address this issue. EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION The educational intervention was conducted from February 2015 through September 2015. The intervention each month consisted of the following actions: We identified all beneficiaries under the age of 21 who had a prescription filled for an antipsychotic and determine d if they had medical claims for metabolic monitoring within one year prior to the prescription fill. Providers were ranked based on the number of their patients who had filled antipsychotic prescriptions during the previous month and had not had medical claims documenting appropriate metabolic monitoring during the previous year. The providers with the largest number of patients not receiving monitoring were mailed a letter informing them of the importance of metabolic monitoring and reporting their rates for the prior month and the overall rate for all providers in the state during that month. Up to 100 providers were contacted monthly. N o provider was contacted more often than once every three months. Each month, providers were ranked based on their rate of compliance with metabolic monitoring for beneficiaries filling prescriptions that month. The top 100 providers were sent the educational mailin g notifying them about the importance of metabolic monitoring and their performance on the quality measure during the previous month. A total of 179 different providers were contacted as part of the intervention. 70% of these providers were contacted mor e than once. The prescribers contacted during the intervention accounted for more than 80% of the children filling prescriptions for antipsychotics during this time period. EVALUATION Analyses were conducted t o evaluate the pre- vs post -intervention period behavior among providers contacted during the intervention. In order to compare pre - and post -educational intervention periods and to measure lab monitoring in a manner similar to what could be detected through prospective DUR, modific ations were made in the technical specifications for the quality measures. The quality measure is defined as the percentage of beneficiaries taking an Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 32antipsychotic at any time during the observation period who have claims for metabolic monitoring anytime during the same observation period. For purposes of the evaluation, th e measure was converted into a prospective DUR edit in which each prescription fill was c hecked to determine if claim (s) for metabolic monitoring were found within a one -year look back period. This criteria was applied to all antipsychotic prescriptions filled for children during the pre and post observation periods. The pre observation period was April - November, 2014 and the post observation period was April - November, 2015. The sa me months were used for each period to control for any seasonal variations that might occur. For each observation period, beneficiaries with at least one prescription meeting metabolic monitoring criterion were classified as having met the criteria. When calculating physician rates, children were attributed to the prescriber of the last antipsychotic prescription filled during the observation period. Performance r ates for prescribers were calculated for each observation period as the percentage of children attributed to the provider who met the metabolic monitoring criteria. This modification in the measurement resulted in higher percentages for obtaining metabolic monitoring than did the technical specifications used in the quality measure . This occurs be cause there was a full year look -back for every prescription filled because th e look -back period include d months prior to the beginning of the observation period. Beneficiar ies were included in the analysis if they met all of the following inclusion criteria: Age < 21 years at time of prescription fill; and Enrolled in Medicaid at least 3 months during observation period ; and Not dual -enrolled or a resident in a long -term -care facility ; and Had > 3 prescription fills for antipsychotics . The percent of beneficiaries classified as meeting the metabolic monitoring requirement during each observation period are reported in Table 1 , which describes whether they had a visit with the provider prescribing their antipsychotic prescription during the observati on period. Overall, the percentage of children taking antipsychotics who had metabolic monitoring did not change significantly between the 2014 and 2015 observation periods. It was assumed that p rescribers would most likely wait until the next patient visi t to perform metabolic monitoring after receiving the educational letter , therefore, we examine d changes in the rates for metabolic monitoring for children having office visits and those not having office visits during the two observation periods. Among c hildren having office visits, a slight increase (+2.9%) in the rate for lipid monitoring was observed .

NOTE: Includes all beneficiaries with 3+ prescription fills during each period ALL Children Taking Antipsychotics Children WITH Visit During Observation Period Children WITHOUT Visit During Observation Period The rates for children receiving metabolic monitoring by whether the prescribing provider was contacted in the educational initiative or not are shown in Table 2 . The educational initiative increased the rate of monitoring among children on antipsychotics prescribed by providers contact ed during the intervention by only 1.4%. A decrease was seen in the percentage of children having glucose monitoring. Among prescribers who were not contacted as part of the educational initiative, the percentage of children being prescribed APs that had glucose monitoring went down -7.0% and the percentage having lipid monitoring went down -5.5%. It appears that the initiative had a small beneficial effect among the providers contacted. # Children on APsGlucose monitoringbLipid -7.0% -5.5% -7.2%TABLE 2: Percentage of Children Taking Antipsychotics Having Metabolic Monitoring Within One Year of a Prescription Fill by Whether The Prescriber Was Contacted During Educational Initiativea (Prescription fills between April - November 2014 and April - November 2015; FFS and CCOs) NOTE: Includes all beneficiaries with 3+ prescription fills during each period Children With Prescribers CONTACTED in 2015 Children With Prescribers NOT CONTACTED in 2015 a Educational intervention letters were mailed from February 2015 - September 2015. 2014 data are reported as baseline information for the contacted providers. b Monitoring was considered to have occurred if a medical claim containing a procedure code included in the measure technical specifications was found within one year of the prescription fill. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 34As previously noted, providers are not likely to schedule lab tests until the next patient visit. Table 3 compares provider rates for monitoring by whether the prescriber was contacted as part of the educational initiative and whether the beneficiary had an office visit during the observation period. Comparing the two observation periods in this breakdown provides a method of examining whether provider behaviors actually changed with respect to ordering lab tests during office visits. Performance on monitoring actually decreased among providers not contacted through the educational initiative. Among p roviders who were contacted the rate of monitoring for lipids increased by 5.2% and the rate for glucose monitoring decreased by 2.4% for beneficiaries who had office visits during the observation periods.

Priority was given to contacting providers with high numbers of children without monitoring. As such, few of the providers with only one or two patients were contacted. As shown in Table 4, providers with only a few children on APs had the lowest rates for metabolic monitoring. These providers do not account for a very large percentage of t he children on APs, but do continue to present a problem with respect to metabolic monitoring.

TABLE 4: Prescriber Performance Rates For Metabolic Monitoring by Number of Children Prescribed Antipsychotics During 2015 Observation Period (Prescription fills between April - November 2015; FFS and CCOs) Number of Children Prescribed APs in 2015 CONCLUSION The educational intervention conducted in 2015 appears to have had a small positive effect on metabolic monitoring rate s. However, the program did not increase rates as much as would be desired , even among the providers who were contacted. Additional educational actions and/or clinical edits or procedures are needed to adequately address metabolic monitoring in children taking antipsychotics . However, when beneficiaries saw prescribers at their offices, rates for metabolic monitoring were higher. The number of children taking antipsychotics and not having office visits during the 8 -month observation periods is a concern and may indicate that increased supervision of beneficiaries taking antipsychotics is needed. Next Steps : In the next few months, DOM and MS -DUR will be participating in a committee of 10 state Medicaid programs selected by the American Drug Utilization Review Society (ADURS) that will meet with representatives from CMS to discuss programs for monitoring antipsychotic use among children. MS-DUR will present findings from this meeting to the DURB at the April 2016 meeting. At this time, MS -DUR seeks input from the DUR Board regarding what might be more effective methods for communicating the importance of metabolic monitoring to providers.

Traditionally, the DEA focused on abuses amongst independent pharmacies, but have recently increased their scrutiny and enforcement to large pharmacy chains, long term care providers , and drug wholesalers. 7 In December 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sent information to state agencies ( Appendix B) announcing updates in the Adult and Child Core Set qu ality measures . In response to concerns about opioid abuse and overdose, CMS announced the inclusion of the Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) quality measures focused on opioid prescriptions from multiple providers and high dose opioid use (see Table 1) . Measure Sponsor: Measure Name Measure Description PQA: Use of Opioids from Multiple Providers or at High Dosage in Persons Without Cancer: Opioid High DosageThe proportion (XX out of 1,000) of individuals without cancer receiving a daily dosage of opioids greater than 120mg morphine equivalent dose (MED) for 90 consecutive days or longer. PQA: Use of Opioids from Multiple Providers or at High Dosage in Persons Without Cancer: Multiple prescribers and multiple pharmaciesThe proportion (XX out of 1,000) of individuals without cancer receiving prescriptions for opioids from four (4) or more prescribers AND four (4) or more pharmacies. PQA: Use of Opioids from Multiple Providers or at High Dosage in Persons Without Cancer: Multiple-provider, high dosageThe proportion (XX out of 1,000) of individuals without cancer receiving prescriptions for opioids greater than 120mg morphine equivalent dose (MED) for 90 consecutive days or longer, AND who received opioid prescriptions from four (4) or more prescribers AND four (4) or more pharmacies.TABLE 1: Opioid Quality Measures Added to the CMS Adult Core Measurement Sets for 2016 6 OIG Work Plan 2016, p 31. http://oig.hhs.gov/reports - 2016.pdf 7 Keast SL, Nesser N, Farmer K (2015) Strategies aimed at controlling misuse and abuse of opioid prescription medications in a state Medicaid program: a policymaker 's perspective, The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse, 41:1, 1 -6, DOI: 10.3109/00952990.2014.988339. Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/00952990.2014.988339 Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 38During the February 2014 DUR Board Meeting the board recommended and approved an educational intervention program to be implemented by MS -DUR based on the quality measures that were being developed by PQA. For the previous 18 months, MS -DUR conducted an analysis of the monthly mailings notifying providers about beneficiaries recei ving prescriptions from four or more unique prescribers. The previous educational activity was directed at notifying prescribers when suspected doctor/pharm acy shopping was occurring. This intervention primary addressed possible abuse and safety problems that could occur from lack of coordination among prescribers. When the intervention was implemented , the maximum morphine equivalent daily dose (MED D) compon ent was not included due to uncertainty within the PQA workgroup about the specific criteria for maximum daily doses. The Mississippi Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (MPMP) was established to help providers, professional boards , and drug enforcement agencies track prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances. The Board of Medical Licensure required all physicians to be enrolled in the MPMP by December 2013. Last year, the Board of Pharmacy required all pharmacists to be enrolled by Dec ember 2015. Providers can use the MPMP to identify potentially inappropriate use by patients when they are considering writing a prescription or when they are requested to fill a prescription for an opiate. Although physicians and pharmacists are require d to register, utilization review of Medicaid claims still indicates not all providers are using the MPMP system to detect poten tial overdose or abuse. As PQA has finalized their opiate related quality measures and CMS has added the measures to the Adult Core Set, MS -DUR proposes a revised educational intervention to address concerns about safety and the potentials for abuse. The Opioid High Dosage measure addresses higher than recommended daily doses of opioids for an extended period of time. The o utlier to the first measure in Table 1 would occur when a beneficiary without cancer receiv ed a daily dosage of opioids greater than 120mg MEDD for 90 consecutive days or longer. Long- term use of opioids at high doses can contribute to the likelihood of overdose, a major safety concern and e xtended use at high doses can increase the risk of addiction and subsequent abuse. The Multiple Prescriber and Multiple Pharmacy measure address the concept of \"doctor shopping.\" The outlier to the second measure in Table 1 would occur when a beneficiary without cancer receiv ed prescriptions for opioids from four (4) or more prescribers AND four (4) or more pharmacies . Obtaining prescriptions for opiates from multiple prescribers and utilizing multiple pharmacies is an indicator of potential abuse, especially when the geographical locations of the prescribers and/or pharmacies does not reflect a reasonable utilization pattern. Even when abuse is not occurring, use of multiple prescribers represents a potential safety problem d ue to the potential for uncoordinated care and an increased risk of overdose. The combined measure using high dosage and multiple providers is a strong indicator of potential abuse and/or a significant safety problem. The outlier to the t hird measure in Table 1 would occur when a beneficiary without cancer receiv ed a daily dosage of opioids greater than 120mg ME DD Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 39for 90 consecutive days or longer AND the beneficiary received prescriptions for opioids from four (4) or more prescribers AND four (4) or more pharmacies . Exceptions occurring to any of these quality measure concepts are a serious concern. Providers need to be informed when exceptions to these quality measures occur in order to alert them to potential coordination of care issue s resulting from multip le providers being involved and increased safety concerns due to high dosages and the potential for addiction/abuse . An important part of the educational intervention needs to be encouraging appropriate use of the MPMP database. RECOMMENDATIONS: In order to more completely address the new Adult Core measures, MS -DUR proposes the following recommendations for the DUR Board: 1. MS-DUR initiates an educational intervention based on the Opioid High Dosage measure. Each month beneficiaries filling an opioid prescription during the previous month will be identified if they exceed the criteria in the first measure during a six -month look back period. ALL prescribers and pharmacies involved in the prescriptions contributing to the exception will be notified. 2. MS-DUR initiates an education intervention based on the Multiple Prescriber and Multiple Pharmacy measure. Each month beneficiaries filling an opioid prescription during the previous month will be identified if they exceed th e criteria in the second measure during a six-month look back period. ALL prescribers and pharmacies involved in the prescriptions contributing to the exception will be notified. 3. MS-DUR will conduct a quarterly analysis base d on the combined Opioid High D osage and Multiple Prescriber/Pharmacy measure. Beneficiaries will be identified who exceed the criteria in the third measure and a report will be provide d to Medicaid Program Integrity for further investigation and evaluation for DOM consideration for lo ck-in. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 40CDC GUIDELINE FOR PRESCRIBING OPIOIDS FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND DUR ACTIONS: BACKGOUND FOR INITIAL DISCUSSION BACKGROUND As described in the background section of the previous report on the High Morphine Equivalent Dosing (Med) and Doctor Shopping Educational Initiatives , the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) has strongly recommended that steps must be taken to address opioid misuse and diversion. The OIG 2016 Work Plan will focus on state actions taken through drug utilization review (DUR) programs to address opioid misuse and abuse in state Medicaid. 1 Effort s are directed to protect \"an expanding Medicaid program from fraud, waste, and abuse.\" Various efforts have been underway in Mississippi to address the opioid abuse problem. The Mississippi Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (MPMP) was established to help providers, professional boards and drug enforcement agencies track prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances. The Board of Medical Licensure required all p hysicians to be enrolled in the MPMP by December 2013. The Board of Pharmacy required all pharmacists to be enrolled by December 2015. Providers can use the MPMP to identify potentially inappropriate use by patients when they are considering writing a pre scription or when they are requested to fill a prescription for an opiate. Mississippi Medicaid uses the MPMP to evaluate potential drug abuse cases , to make decisions about prior authorization (PA) approvals and to make decisions about assigning beneficia ries to the lock -in program. The lock -in program limits which and how many providers and pharmacies a beneficiary can use. Recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a new tool that allows providers and others to track the number of opioid prescription claims in their communities, counties and states. The tool - The Opioid Heat Map - shows local level data of de -identified Medicare Part D opioid prescription claims, comparing the local area to data across the country 1 OIG Work Plan 2016, p 31. http://oig.hhs.gov/reports -and- publications/archives/workplan/2016/oig -work -plan - 2016.pdf Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page ). The data currently used in this mapping tool is from 2013 Medicare Part D prescription drug claims. The tool was developed in response to the increasing amount of deaths each year related to drug overdose for both opioid - based pain relievers and from illicit drugs like heroin. CMS noted that in 2013, overdose from prescription opioid pain relievers claimed more than 16,000 lives, with more than 145,000 people dying from these overdoses in the last decade. Two images from the mapping tool show the ratings by state and the statistics for Hinds County with the state and national averages. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 42The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released draft Guidelines for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain for public comment , whic h is due by Jan uary 13. The draft guideline summarizes scientific knowle dge about the effectiveness and risks of long -term opioid therapy and provides recommendations for when to initiate or continue opioids for chronic pain; opioid selection, dosage, duration, follow -up, and discontinuation; and assessing risk and addressing harms of opioid use. The draft Guideline identifies important gaps in the literature where further research is needed. It is intended to be used by primary care providers who are treating patients with chronic pain (i.e., pain lasting longer than 3 months or past the time of normal tissue healing) in outpatient settings. The draft Guideline is intended to apply to patients aged 18 years of age or older with chronic pain outside of palliative and end -of-life care. The Guideline is not intended to apply to patients in treatment for active cancer. The Guideline is not a federal regulation; adherence to the Guideline will be voluntary. The complete guideline and background materials are available and comments can be provided at: http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC -2015- 0112- 0001 The following is an excerpt from the CDC document. Opioid s are commonly prescribed for pain. An estimated 20% of patients presenting to physician offices with non- cancer pain symptoms or pain -related diagnoses (including acute and chronic pain) receive an opioid prescription .2 In 2012, health care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid pain medication, enough for every adult in the United States to have a bottle of pills .3 Opioid prescriptions per capita increased 7.3% from 2007 to 2012, with opioid prescribing rates increasing more for family practice, general practice, and internal medicine compared with other specialties .4 Rates of opioid prescribing vary greatly across states in ways that cannot be explained by the underlying health status of the population, highlighting the lack of consensus among providers on how to use opioid pain medication .3 Prevention, assessment, and treatment of chronic pain are challenges for health providers and systems. Pain might go unrecognized, and patients can be at risk for inadequate pain treatment, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, women, the elderly, persons with cognitive impairment, and those with cancer and at the end of life . 5 Patients should receive appropriate pain treatment based on a careful consideration of the benefits and risks o f treatment options. Chronic pain can be the result of an underlying medical disease or condition, injury, medical treatment, inflammation, or an unknown cause5. Estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain vary, but it is clear that the number of persons experiencing chronic pain in the United States is 2 Daubresse M, Chang HY, Yu Y, et al.

The 1999- 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey estimated a prevalence of current widespread or localized pain lasting at least 3 months of 14.6%. 6 The overall prevalence of common, predominantly musculoskeletal pain conditions that can be chronic (e.g., arthritis, rheumatism, chronic back or neck problems, and frequent severe headaches) was estimated at 43% among adults in the United States 7 based on a survey conducted during 2001- 2003. Most recently, analysis of data from the 2012 National Health Interview Study revealed an estimated prevalence of daily pain of 11.2% .8 It is hard to estimate the number of persons who could potentially benefit from opioid pain medication long term. Although evidence supports short -term efficacy of opioids for reducing pain and improving function in non- cancer nociceptive and neuropathic pain in trials lasting <16 weeks ,9 few studies to assess the long- term benefits of opioids for chronic pain (pain lasting >3 months) with outcomes examined at least 1 year later have been conducted.10 On the basis of data available from health systems, researchers estimate that 9.6 to 11.5 million adults, or approximately 3%-4% of the adult U.S. population, were prescribed long -term opioid therapy in 2005.11 In the past decade, while the death rate for the top leading causes of death such as heart disease and cancer has decreased substantially, the death rate associated with opioid pain medication has increased substantially .12 Since 1999, more than 140,000 persons have died from overdose related to opioid pain medication in the United States .13 More than 16,000 deaths occurred in 2013, four times the number of overdose deaths related to these drugs in 1999. 14 Sales of opioid pain medication have increased in parallel with opioid -related overdose deaths .15 The Drug Abuse Warning Network estimated that >420,000 emergency department visits were related to the misuse or abuse of narcotic pain relievers in 2011, the most recent year for which data are available .16 6 Hardt J, Jacobsen C, Goldberg J, et al.

In 2013, an estimated 1.9 million persons abused or were dependent on prescription opioid pain medication (based on DSM -IV criteria) .17 Having a history of a prescription for an opioid pain medication increases the risk for overdose and opioid use disorder ,18, 19, 20 highlighting the value of guidance on safer prescribing practices for providers. The CDC guidelines have sparked considerable controversy21 with regard to the secrecy surrounding the development process and concerns about overly restricting patients' access to needed medications. M ajor recommendations included in the proposed guidelines is provided in Appendix B. Regardless of changes that might result from comments received, the final guidelines will probably be very similar to the proposed guidelines and should have significant impact on criteria that will be used by drug utilization review (DUR) programs.

Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 48 Appendix Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 49Table 1 was updated on August 13, 2015 March 31, 2015 Improving the Quality of Care: Antipsychotic Use in Children and Adolescents Key Points: Prescribing of antipsychotic medications to children and adolescents is increasing, despite a lack of safety data and a high risk of neurologic, psychiatric, and metabolic adverse effects. Antipsychotic medications should be prescribed for a specific clinical indication only when the scientific evidence supports the likelihood that benefits will exceed harms. For children and adolescents, use of antipsychotic medication for United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications generally implies more certainty that benefits will exceed risks, compared to off-label use. Prescribing beyond FDA-approved indications must be approached cautiously. No antipsychotics are FDA-approved for patients under three years of age. Only two older, first-generation antipsychotics are FDA-approved for patients under five years of age. FDA-approved indications for children under 10 years of age are very limited, especially among newer, second-generation antipsychotics. As of October 1, 2014, any use of antipsychotics for Medi-Cal beneficiaries 0 - 17 years of age requires an approved Treatment Authorization Request (TAR). Concurrent use of more than one antipsychotic medication is not recommended. Among all children and adolescents in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service population with at least 90 consecutive days of antipsychotic medication treatment, almost 6 percent were taking two or more antipsychotic medications concurrently for at least 90 consecutive days. Serious adverse effects are common with antipsychotic medication use, particularly weight gain, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. While both baseline and periodic metabolic monitoring is recommended, only 37 percent of children and adolescents in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service population had appropriate metabolic testing during a one-year time period. Psychosocial care, which includes behavioral interventions, psychological therapies, and skills training, among others, remains the recommended first-line treatment option for children and adolescents for nonpsychotic conditions such as attention deficit disorder and disruptive behaviors. Antipsychotic medications, when prescribed, should be part of a comprehensive, multi-modal plan for coordinated treatment that includes psychosocial care. The safest use of antipsychotic medications in children and adolescents requires close, in-person clinical monitoring by prescribers for both clinical response and adverse neurologic, psychiatric, and metabolic effects. Background Prescribing of antipsychotic medications to children and adolescents has increased rapidly in recent decades, driven by new prescriptions and by longer duration of use.1 The frequency of prescribing antipsychotics to children and adolescents increased almost fivefold from 1996 - 2002, from 8.6 per 1,000 to 39.4 per 1,000.2 A national study found that prescribing of atypical antipsychotics increased 62 percent from 2002 - 2007 among children and adolescents enrolled in Medicaid.3 Although some clinical evidence supports the efficacy of antipsychotics in patients under 18 years of age for certain narrowly defined conditions, according to a 2011 report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), children taking antipsychotic medications receive an APPENDIX A Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 50 atypical antipsychotic 90 percent of the time, and in the majority of patients the use is for an off-label indication, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior.4 One study found that in the Medicaid population, more than 3/4 of children and adolescents were taking antipsychotics for an indication that is not FDA approved.5 For reference, current FDA-approved indications for selected antipsychotic medications are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Antipsychotic Medications: FDA-approved Indications for Children and Adolescents Age (years) <1 1 - 2 3 - 4 5 6 - 9 10 - 11 12 13 - 17 Second -Generat ion (Atypical) Antipsychotics NONE molindone* NONE S NONE S pimozide T thioridazine* NONE S thiothixene* NONE S trifluop erazine* NONE S * As of the date of publication of this article, these drugs appear on the Medi-Cal List of Contract Drugs, although some medications have restrictions on manufacturer codes.

Key: B Severe behavioral problems marked by combativeness and/or explosive hyperexcitable behavior and short -term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders D Acute depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder (along with fluoxetine) H Hyperactivity I Irritability associ ated with autism disorder M Manic or mixed episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder P Psychosis S Schizophrenia T Tourette's Syndrome While antipsychotic medications can be of significant benefit, these drugs also have serious common side effects, including weight gain, hyperprolactinemia, and metabolic disturbance, Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 51 which may result in children and adolescents developing into adults who struggle with obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemias.6 In addition, serious neurologic side effects, such as tardive dyskinesia, are associated with both first- and second-generation antipsychotic medications.7 Even when used for approved indications, antipsychotic medications can complicate treatment by creating or unmasking additional psychiatric symptoms, including sedation, agitation, anxiety, and suicidal thinking and behavior.7 Therefore, antipsychotics should be prescribed for a specific clinical indication only when the scientific evidence supports the likelihood that benefits will exceed harms, and the risk of treatment should be considered and periodically re-evaluated for each individual patient . Considering that atypical antipsychotics already have the greatest mean prescription cost of any psychotropic medication and are the most costly drug class within the Medicaid program, the additional costs associated with potential long-term treatment of chronic diseases makes it even more important for providers to carefully balance the economic and medical consequences with the potential benefits of treatment.5,8 In addition, a recent systematic review found that among children and adolescents prescribed any antipsychotic, 10 percent were taking multiple concurrent antipsychotics.9 One study of a large state Medicaid fee-for-service program found that approximately seven percent of children 6 - 17 years of age taking any antipsychotic were prescribed two or more antipsychotics for longer than 60 days.10 These rates are of particular concern given that none of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) practice parameters recommend concurrent use of multiple antipsychotic medications, due to a lack of high-quality studies on the side effects and clinical efficacy of multiple concurrent antipsychotics.11,12 Measuring Quality Care: Safe and Judicious Use of Antipsychotics in Children and Adolescents For 2015, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS\u00ae) added the following three new measures focused on the safe and judicious use of antipsychotic medications in children and adolescents:13 1. Metabolic Monitoring for Children and Adolescents on Antipsychotics (APM), which assesses the percentage of children and adolescents who have ongoing use of antipsychotic medications and metabolic testing during the measurement year. AACAP practice parameters for the use of atypical antipsychotic medications in children and adolescents state: \"The acute and long -term safety of these medications in children and adolescents has not been fully evaluated and therefore careful and frequent monitoring of side effects should be performed...Ideally, monitoring of BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and fasting lipid profiles should follow, whenever feasible, the recommendations found in the consensus statement put forth by the American Diabetes Association and the American Psychiatric Association.\" (Recommendation 10, Clinical Guideline ).11 Table 2. American Diabetes Association Screening Guidelines for Patients on Second- Generation Antipsychotics14 Baseline 4 weeks 8 weeks 12 weeks Annually Personal & family history X X Weight (BMI) X X X X Waist circumference X X Blood pressure X X X Fasting plasma glucose X X X Fasting lipid profile X X \"Careful attention should be given t o the increased risk of developing diabetes with the use of atypical antipsychotic agents (AAA), and blood glucose levels and other parameters should be obtained at baseline and monitored at regular intervals.\" (Recommendation 12, Clinical Standard ).11 Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 52 \"In those patients with significant weight changes and/or a family history indicating high risk, lipid profiles should be obtained at baseline and monitored at regular intervals.\" (Recommendation 13, Clinical Guideline).11 2. Use of Multiple Concurrent Antipsychotics in Children and Adolescents (APC), which assesses the percentage of children and adolescents who were taking two or more concurrent antipsychotics for at least 90 days during the measurement year. AACAP practice parameters for the use of atypical antipsychotic medications in children and adolescents state: \"The simultaneous use of multiple AAA has not been studied rigorously and generally should be avoided.\" ( Recommendation 8, Not Endorsed).11 3. Use of First-line Psychosocial Care for Children and Adolescents on Antipsychotics (APP), which assesses the percentage of children and adolescents who had a new prescription for an antipsychotic medication without a primary indication for it and had documentation of psychosocial care as first-line treatment. AACAP practice parameters for the use of atypical antipsychotic medications in children and adolescents state: \"Prior to the initiation of and during treatment with an AAA, the general guidelines that pertain to the prescription of psychotropic medications should be followed.\" (Recommendation 1, Clinical Standard).11 \"When selecting any AAA for use in a child or adolescent, the clinician should follow the most current available evidence i n the scientific literature.\" ( Recommendation 2, Clinical Standard) . Medi-Cal Policy Aligns with Clinical Guidelines Medi-Cal has always required an approved TAR for the use of antipsychotics for non-FDA approved indications, and for any use in children less than 6 years of age. Of note, it was found that requiring an approved TAR for non-FDA approved indications was often difficult to enforce. Since May 1, 2012, antipsychotic use for Medi-Cal beneficiaries 6 - 17 years of age has been restricted to the use of one antipsychotic, except during titration period and, within this age group, concurrent use of two or more antipsychotics has required an approved TAR. As of October 1, 2014, any use of antipsychotics for Medi-Cal beneficiaries 0 - 17 years of age requires an approved TAR. For additional information about this policy, a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document is available on the California Department of Health Care Services Pharmacy Benefits Division website at http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/Pages/PharmacyBenefits2.aspx . Antipsychotic Use Among Children and Adolescents in the Medi-Cal Fee- for-Service Population A retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate two of the HEDIS performance measures for antipsychotic medication use among children and adolescents (APM and APC) in the Medi- Cal fee-for-service population, using medical and pharmacy claims data. Study population selection criteria were adapted from HEDIS performance indicators and included all Medi-Cal beneficiaries who m et the following inclusion criteria: Continuously eligible beneficiary enrolled in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service program for the duration of the measurement year (October 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014) 1 - 17 years of age as of September 30, 2014 At least one paid pharmacy claim for an antipsychotic medication during the measurement year Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 53 Descriptive statistics were used to summarize beneficiary characteristics and HEDIS rates. Data were stratified into three age groups, per HEDIS specifications. Results A total of 6,688 Medi-Cal fee-for-service beneficiaries met the inclusion criteria, and within this group there were a total of 58,598 paid claims for antipsychotic medications. Demographic characteristics of the beneficiaries are listed in Table 3 including gender and race/ethnicity. Table 3. Demographic Characteristics of the Medi-Cal Fee- for-Service Study Population 1 - 5 years 6 - 11 years 12 - 17 years Overall Population (n = 6,688) 82 (1%) 2,038 (30%) 4,568 (55%) 2,348 (51%) The was almost 2/3 male (n = 4,439; 65%) and almost half of these beneficiaries identified as white/Caucasian race, non-Hispanic ethnicity (n = 3,173; 47%). Overall rates for APM (Table 4) and APC (Table 5), as well as rates stratified by the three age groups are listed below. Of note, for the APM calculation, a total of 675 beneficiaries were excluded as they only had one paid claim for an antipsychotic medication during the measurement year (leaving a denominator of 6,013 beneficiaries) and, for the APC calculation, a total of 1,313 beneficiaries were excluded as they had less than 90 days of continuous antipsychotic medication treatment during the measurement year (leaving a denominator of 5,375 beneficiaries). Table 4. Metabolic Monitoring in Child ren and Adolescents with 2 Paid Claims for Antipsychotic Medications During the Measurement Year (October 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014) Age Group Numerator Denominator Percentage of children and adolescents with 2 paid claims for antipsychotic medications and metabolic testing Children and adolescents with 1 test for both blood glucose/HbA1C and LDL-C/cholesterol Children and adolescents with 2 paid claims for antipsychotic medications 1 - 5 years 18 68 26.5% 6 - 11 years 575 1,838 31.3% 12 years 1,653 4,107 40.2% TOTAL 2,246 6,013 37.4% Although the 37.4 percent figure calculated using HEDIS measure parameters gives the rate at which both tests were completed (blood glucose or HbA1C and LDL-C or cholesterol), individual testing rates were also calculated for the study population. The rate of glucose or Hb1AC monitoring (n = 3,151; 52.4%), was much greater than LDL-C or cholesterol monitoring Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 54 (n = 2,279; 37.9%), suggesting there is an opportunity for outreach to providers, who could raise the metabolic monitoring rate calculated in the HEDIS measure by ordering both tests at the same time. Of note, the HEDIS documentation for this measure included an analysis using the 2008 Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data files. These data showed an average metabolic monitoring rate across data collected from 11 states of 18.5 percent (range: 4.8 percent - 36.2 percent), more than half the rate found in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service population.13 Table 5. Children and Adolescents on Multiple Concurrent Antipsychotic Medications During the Measurement Year (October 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014) Age Group Numerator Denominator Percentage of children and adolescents on 2 concurrent antipsychotic medications Children and adolescents on 2 concurrent antipsychotic medications 90 consecutive days Children and adolescents with 90 consecutive days of antipsychotic medication treatment 1 - 5 years 0 53 0.0% 6 - 11 years 61 1,665 3.7% 12 - 17 years 245 3,657 6.7% TOTAL 306 5375 5.7% This calculated rate of 5.7 percent of Medi-Cal fee-for-service beneficiaries on multiple concurrent antipsychotic medications is close to the published rates for this measure found in the HEDIS documentation, which used the 2008 MAX data files and found average rate of 6.0 percent across 11 states (range: 2.8 percent - 9.4 percent).13 Within the 306 beneficiaries identified on greater than two concurrent antipsychotic medications for at least 90 consecutive days, concurrent use of aripiprazole, risperidone, and/or quetiapine accounted for 65.4 percent of concurrent antipsychotic medication use, including concurrent use of risperidone-aripiprazole (n = 70), quetiapine-aripiprazole (n = 68), quetiapine-risperidone (n = 62). Clinical Recommendations Psychosocial care, which includes behavioral interventions, psychological therapies, and skills training, among others, is the recommended first-line treatment option for children and adolescents diagnosed with nonpsychotic conditions such as attention-deficit disorder and disruptive behaviors. Prior to the initiation of treatment with antipsychotic medication, obtain a personal and family history of diabetes and hyperlipidemia, seizures and cardiac abnormalities, as well as any family history of previous response or adverse events associated with antipsychotic medication. When prescribed, antipsychotic medications should be part of a comprehensive, multi-modal plan for coordinated treatment that includes psychosocial care. Antipsychotic dosing should follow the \"start low and go slow\" approach and seek to find the lowest effective dose. Determination of an appropriate target dose should follow both the current scientific literature and the clinical response of the patient, while also monitoring the patient for side effects and tolerability. Multiple clinical guidelines suggest that higher than approved dosages of antipsychotic medications should be avoided.14 Periodically review the ongoing need for continued therapy with antipsychotic medications. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 55 Monitor BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and fasting lipid profiles according to the recommendations found in the consensus statement put forth by the American Diabetes Association and the American Psychiatric Association.

Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 57CMCS Informational Bulletin DATE: December 11, 2015 FRO M: Vikki Wachino Director Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services SU BJECT: 2016 Updates to the Child and Adult Core Health Care Quality Measurement Sets Thi s informational bulletin describes the 2016 updates to the core set of children's health care quality measures for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (Child Core Set) and the core set of health care quality measures for adults enrolled in Medicaid (Adult Core Set). Background The C enter for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) has worked with stakeholders to identify two core sets of health care quality measures that can be used to assess the quality of health care provided to children and adults enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP sets are tools states can use to monitor and improve the quality of health care provided to Medicaid and CHIP enrollees. The goals of this effort are to: Enc ourage nat ional reporting by states on a uniform set of measures; and Support states in using these measures to drive quality improvement. Par t of implementing an effective \"quality measures reporting program\" is to periodically reassess the measures that comprise it since many factors, such as changes in clinical guidelines and experiences with reporting and performance rates , may warrant modifying the measure set. In addition, CMCS continues to prioritize working with federal partners to promote quality measurem ent alignment across programs (e.g., Meaningful Use, Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program, Physician Quality Reporting System) recognizing that this reduces burden on states reporting data to multiple programs and helps to drive quality improvement across payers and programs. For the 2016 updates to the Child and Adult Core Sets, CMCS , once again, worked with the National Qualit y Forum's (NQF) Measure Applications Partnership (MAP),1 a public-private partnership that reviews measures for potential use in federal public reporting, to review and identify ways to improve the core sets. Collaborating with NQF's MAP process for core set updates promotes measure alignment across CMS since NQF also reviews measures for other CMS reporting programs. 1 http://www.qualityforum.org/Setting_Priorities/Partnership/Measure_Applications_Partnership.aspx APPENDIX B Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 58CMCS is encouraged by state reporting on the core measures. For the Child Core Set, fifty states and the District of Columbia voluntarily reported , for federal fiscal year (FFY) 201 4, a median of 16 measures. For the Adult Core Set, 3 4 states reported a median of 17 measures in FFY 2014. Additional information on state reporting and performance on each core set can be found in the forthcomi ng respective 2015 Annual Report on the Quality of Care for Children in Medicaid and CHIP and the 2015 Annual Report on the Quality of Care for Adults Enrolled in Medicaid . CMCS looks forward to working with states on the core measures reporting for FFY 2015. 2016 Child Core Set Since the release of the initial Child Core Set in 2011, CMCS has collaborated with state Medicaid and CHIP agencies to voluntarily collect, report, and use the measures to drive quality improvements. Section 1139A of the Social Security Act , as amended by Section 401(a) of the Children's H ealth Insurance Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) of 2009, provides that, beginning annually in January 2013, the Secretary shall publish recommended changes to the core measures. 2 For the 2016 Child Core Set update, CMCS will add two measures: Use of M ultiple Concurrent Antipsychotics in Children and A dolescents3 Audio logical Evaluation no later than 3 months of age4 The addition of these two measures allows CMCS to expand the measurement of quality of care for two populations - children prescribed psychotropic drugs and children at -risk of hearing problems. CMCS also is engaged in a pilot of a reporting process for the child version of the hospital Consumer Assessment of Heal thcare Providers and Systems survey (Child HCAHPS) 5 in order to determine whether or not to include HCAHPS in a future Child Core Set. This measure was recommended by the 2014 MAP to help address gaps noted in the measure set in three areas: inpatient care; patient experience; and care coordination. Additional information about the 2015 Child Core Set MAP review process and their recommendations to CM CS can be found at: Core Set In January 2012, CMCS released its initial Adult Core Set. Section 1139B of the Social Security Act, as amended by Section 2701 of the Affordable Care Act, notes that the Secretary shall issue updates to the Adult Core Set beginning in January 2014 and annually thereafter.6, 7 2 The first update was issued via a State Health Official Letter \"2013 Children's Core Set of Health http://www.medicaid.gov/Federa l-Policy -Guidance/downloads/SHO issued via a CMCS Informational Bulletin \"2014 Updates to the Child and Adult Core Health Care Quality Measurement Sets.\" http://medicaid.gov/Federal- Policy -Guidance/Downloads/CIB -12-19-13.pdf as was the \"2015 Updates to the Child and Adult Health Care Quality Measurements Sets.\" http://www.medicaid.gov/federal- policy - in surement (NCINQ), Not NQF Endorsed 4 Measure steward: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NQF #1360 5 Measure steward: Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety -Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, NQF#2548 6 The first update was iss ued via a CMCS Informational Bulletin \"2014 Updates to the Child and Adult Core Health Care Quality Measurement Sets.\" http://medicaid.gov/Federal -Policy -Guidance/Downlo ads/CIB -12-19-13.pdf Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 59 For the 2016 Ad ult Core Set update, CMCS will add two measures: Use of Opioids from Multiple Providers at High Dosage in Persons Without Cancer: Opioid High Dosage8 Diabetes Screening for People With Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder Who Are Using Antipsychotic Medications9 The addition of these two measures allows CMCS and states to expand the measurement of quality of care in Medicaid for two population groups - adults with substance use disorders and/or mental health disor ders.

Describe high-risk prescribing of prescription opioids within the Medi-Cal fee-for-service program. Summarize best practices for responsible opioid prescribing. Key Points: While there is no completely safe dose of opioids , MEDD can be used as an indicator of potential dose-related risk for adverse drug reactions, including overdose. While there are differing opinions as to the maximum MEDD threshold that should trigger additional action by clinicians, the Medical Board of California (MBC) recommends proceeding cautiously once the MEDD reaches 80 mg. In the Medi-Cal fee-for-service population, the vast majority (87%) of paid claims for opioids were well under the 80 mg MEDD threshold recommended by the MBC for a yellow flag warning. Online MEDD calculators are available to help clinicians determine morphine milligram equivalency. These calculators are not intended for dosage conversion from one product to another, but can be used to assess the comparative potency of opioids using a morphine equivalency standard. All providers who prescribe opioids need to e nroll in and access California's prescription drug monitoring program, available on the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES) Web page of the Office of the Attorney General website. In order to be most effective, MEDD calculations need to include all opioid prescriptions written for a patient, including those written by other providers. Background Each day in the United States, 46 people die from an overdose of prescription opioid or narcotic pain relievers.1 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes the following groups as particularly vulnerable to prescription opioid overdose: 1) people who obtain multiple controlled substance prescriptions from multiple providers; 2) those who take high daily dosages of prescription painkillers and those who misuse multiple abuse-prone prescription drugs , especially other CNS depressants, such as benzodiazepines, carisoprodol, or other sedatives ; 3) low-income people and those living in rural areas; and 4) people with mental illness and/or those with a history of substance abuse.2 Morphine Equivalent Daily Dose (MEDD) Recent studies demonstr ate that a patient's cumulative MEDD is an indicator of potential dose-related risk for adverse drug reactions to opioids, including overdose.3,4 The terminology for daily morphine equivalency may vary depending on the resource used, and may be described as MEDD, morphine equivalent dose (MED), or morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Daily morphine milligram equivalents are used to assess comparative potency, but not to convert a particular opioid dosage from one product to another . The calculation to determine morphine milligram equivalents includes drug strength, quantity, days' supply and a defined conversion factor unique to each drug. By converting the dose of an opioid to a morphine APPENDIX C Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 61 equivalent dose, a clinician can determine whether a cumulative daily dose of opioids approaches an amount associated with increased risk. Online calculators are available to estimate MEDD. It should be noted again that these calculators are not intended for dosage conversion from one product to another, but only to assess the comparative potency of opioids . Furthermore, calculated morphine equivalency may vary between tools for certain drugs, depending on the algorithm used. Commonly used websites that offer MEDD calculators include the following: Washington State Agency Medical Directors' Group Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Training and Technical Assistance Center (PDMP TTAC) The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Equianalgesic dose ratios are only approximations and do not account for genetic factors, incomplete cross-tolerance between various opioids, and variable pharmacokinetics that may affect relative potency . If used to estimate a conversion, it is recommended that after calculating the appropriate conversion dose, the prescribed dose be reduced by 25 - 50% to assure patient safety.4 Compared with patients receiving an MEDD of 1 - 20 mg, who had a 0.2% annual overdose rate, patients receiving an MEDD of 100 mg or more had almost nine times as much risk of overdose and a 1.8% annual overdose rate as compared to the lowest doses.3 The CDC review of opioid prescribing and overdose found that among patients who are prescribed opioids, an estimated 80% are prescribed low doses (<100 mg MEDD) by a single provider, and these patients account for an estimated 20% of all prescription drug overdoses. Another 10% of patients are prescribed high doses (100 mg MEDD) of opioids by single prescribers and account for an estimated 40% of prescription opioid overdoses. The remaining 10% of patients seek care from multiple doctors, are prescribed high daily doses, and account for another 40% of opioid overdoses.5 While there are differing opinions among experts and organizations as to the maximum MEDD threshold that should trigger additional action by clinicians (Table 1), the MBC r ecommends proceeding cautiously ( a yellow flag warning) once the MEDD reaches 80 mg.6 There is no completely safe opioid dose.

In addition, as of federal fiscal year 2013 (FFY 2013), nine state Medicaid programs reported having an established policy with a recommended maximum MEDD (Table 2 ).16 Table 2. State Medicaid Drug Use Review (DUR) Programs with Established Recommendations for Maximum MEDD State MEDD Threshold (mg/day) Additional Information Delaware 120 All long -acting opioids require prior authorization. The total dose for all narcotic t herapy must be <120 mg MEDD. Kansas 200 Massachusetts 360 Individual dose limits for each opioid were determine d based on utilization trends. Maine 30 Prior authorization is required for any dose over 30mg; maximum allowable dose 300 mg Michigan 30 North Carolina 750 Maximum allowable dose Oregon 120 Washington 120 Based on Agency Medical Directors Association Interagency Guidelines Wyoming 120 Both Massachusetts and Washington have described in detail the impact of implementing an established policy and predetermined maximum MEDD threshold for triggering a detailed patient review.17,18 Massachusetts defined a specific maximum MEDD for oxycodone, fentanyl, morphine, Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 63 and methadone (they selected two standard deviations outside the mean dose noted in their drug utilization review). In addition to requiring prior authorization for the specified dose, a multidisciplinary team including a physician, pharmacist, and behavioral specialist reviewed high-dose utilization profiles every two weeks. The team participated in phone interventions for clarification of prior authorization requests, treatment care plans, or specific restrictions. Over a three-year period (2002 - 2005), the number of unique utilizers decreased by 17.8% (p <0.0001) and the number of claims by 4.1% (p <0.0001).17 Claims for oxycodone decreased by 34.9% and claims for fentanyl decreased by 25%.17 In 2007, the Washington State Agency Medical Directors ' Group , which represents all public payers in Washington, developed a collaborative interagency guideline on opioid dosing (updated in June 2015 ).4 The guideline recommends that at an MEDD of 120 mg providers must obtain consultation from a pain medicine expert for patients whose pain and function have not substantially improved as a result of opioid treatment. An evaluation of the impact of the guideline was conducted through 2010, and showed the number of prescriptions for Schedule II opioids plateaued during 2006 - 2008, then declined sharply in 2009 and 2010.7 The total number of paid prescriptions for Schedule III opioids had peaked in 1999 (93,550), then declined through 2008 (79,882), 2009 (63,808) and 2010 (52,499).7 The average MEDD among beneficiaries declined from a peak of 144.7 in 2002 to 105 in 2010.18 MEDD in the Medi-Cal Fee-F or-Service Population A retrospective cohort study was conducted to calculate the MEDD for all paid pharmacy claims for prescription opioid medications in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service population (dates of service between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015). The National Drug Code (NDC), days supply, and drug quantity fields were extracted from Medi-Cal pharmacy claims data and matched (via NDC) to the drug strength and MME conversion factor using the Morphine Equivalent Calculator Tool developed by the PDMP TTAC at Brandeis University, in collaboration with the CDC. The following equation was used to calculate MEDD: (Drug Strength) x (Drug Quantity) x (MME Conversion Factor) (Days Supply) All instructions for MEDD calculation were followed using the technical assistance guide provided by the PDMP TTAC.19 An additional analysis was performed on a subset of Medi-Cal fee-for-service beneficiaries who were continuously eligible in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service program between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2015, and who had at least one paid claim for a prescription opioid medication between April 1, 2015, and June 30, 2015 (the measurement period). Medical and pharmacy claims data were reviewed for all beneficiaries in the study population with a calculated cumulative morphine equivalent dose >120 mg for at least one day during the measurement period. Data fields specifying diagnostic codes and place of service were extracted from medical claims data and were used to identify those beneficiaries in the study population who had a primary or secondary diagnosis of cancer and/or who were receiving hospice care. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize MEDD values and claims data. Data analyses were performed using IBM\u00ae SPSS\u00ae, version 23.0 (Chicago, IL). Results Between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2105, a total of 529,681 paid pharmacy claims for prescription opioid medications were filled by a total of 262,017 Medi-Cal fee-for-service beneficiaries. The summary of paid claims exceeding MEDD thresholds of 80 mg, 100 mg, and 120 mg for all paid claims is shown in Table 3 . Also shown in Table 3 is the distribution among a subset of paid claims with a days supply >14 days, as over half (56%) of all paid claims for opioids between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015, were for a days supply 7 days. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 64 Table 3. Total Paid Claims Exceeding Recommended MEDD Thresholds in the Medi-Cal Fee-F or-Service Population (Dates of S ervice Between July 1, 2014, and June 30, Thresholds >80 mg/day 47,769 (26.4%) 54,060 (22.8%) (18.5%) The vast majority of paid claims for opioids were well under the 80 mg/day threshold recommended by the MBC for a yellow flag warning (87% of all paid claims and 74% of paid claims >14 days supply) . However, during one year there were 47,769 paid claims identified that exceeded 120 mg MEDD. As the CDC identified people who obtain multiple controlled substance prescriptions from multiple providers as one of the high-risk groups for opioid overdose, a summary of the total number of prescribers and pharmacies is shown in Table 4 for all Medi-Cal fee-for-service beneficiaries who had a paid claim for an opioid during that same year. Table 4. Crosstabulation of Total Prescribers and Total Pharmacies for Opioid Paid Claims in the Medi-Cal Fee-F or-Service Population (Dates of Service Between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015) Total Utilizing Beneficiaries (n = 262,017) Total Pharmacies 1 2 3 4 5 - 9 10+ Total Prescribers 1 208,071 8,131 886 129 24 66 0 4 648 790 533 249 102 1 5-9 300 403 365 241 208 7 10+ 2 5 3 5 22 7 The majority of these beneficiaries (n = 208,071; 79%) had only one paid claim for a prescription opioid medication during this one-year period. However, a total of 3,611 beneficiaries (1%) had paid claims for opioids from three or more prescribers and filled these claims at three or more pharmacies. A total of 22,505 beneficiaries were included in an analysis of cumulative MEDD. Each of these beneficiaries was continuously eligible in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service program between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2015, and had at least one paid claim for a prescription opioid medication between April 1, 2015, and June 30, 2015. This 90-day window was selected in order to identify the distribution of beneficiaries who exceeded a cumulative total of >120 mg MEDD for at least one of those days, and to identify beneficiaries who exceeded >120 mg MEDD for the entire 90 days, which would make this group at high-risk for overdose due to sustained high-dose opioid use over time. As shown in Table 5, a total of 3,904 beneficiaries (17%) were identified in this group with at least one day out of 90 that exceeded >120 mg cumulative MEDD. Results are stratified by those who had a primary or secondary diagnosis of cancer and/or who were receiving hospice care, and those who did not have a primary or secondary diagnosis of cancer and no indication of hospice care in the medical claims data. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 65 Table 5. Summary of Medi-Cal Fee-F or-Service Beneficiaries Days >120 mg Cumulative MEDD (Dates of Service Between April 1, 2015, and June 30, 2015) Days with MEDD >120 mg Cancer/Hospice (n = 1,306) Non-cancer/ 1,028 beneficiaries that exceeded >120 mg cumulative MEDD for all 90 days, almost half (n = 410; 40%) had only one prescriber and one pharmacy for all opioid claims, while 49 beneficiaries (5%) had paid claims for opioids from three or more prescribers and filled these claims at three or more pharmacies. There was no statistically significant difference between the number of days that exceeded >120 mg cumulative MEDD when stratified by cancer/hospice status. Conclusion/Discussion While there is no completely safe dose of opioids, the ability to calculate morphine equivalent dose adds an additional assessment tool to combat potential opioid overdose and/or overuse. Federal and state agencies should provide guidelines and instructions for calculation of MEDD and promote case management and, as needed, referrals to appropriate pain specialists as higher doses of opioids are considered. Finally, all providers who prescribe opioids need to enroll in and access California's prescription drug monitoring program, CURES. In order to be most effective, MEDD calculations need to include all opioid prescriptions written for a patient, including those written by other providers. Clinical Recommendations Review materials and resources for preventing prescription drug abuse available through the California State Board of Pharmacy , Medical Board of California , and the California Department of Public Health . Weigh the benefits and risks of opioid therapy, especially for opioid therapy when alternative treatments are ineffective. Discuss with patients the risks and benefits of pain treatment options, including those that do not involve prescription painkillers. Follow best practices for responsible opioid prescribing, including: Consult CURES initially and at every subsequent visit Conduct a physical exam, urine drug test, and document pain history prior to prescribing opioids Screen for substance abuse, mental health problems, and other physical conditions that are contraindicated for opioid use Advise against concomitant use of alcohol, sedatives, and hypnotics Implement pain treatment agreements Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 66 Prescribe the lowest effective dose of short-acting opioid producing analgesia and improved function (no more than 80 mg MEDD) in a limited supply with no refills Regularly evaluate the role of opioid therapy beyond 3 months for non-cancer chronic pain Use tapering (not abrupt cessation) to discontinue or reduce dose of opioids Track and document levels of pain and function at every visit Exercise vigilance at high doses Consider prescribing naloxone as a rescue medication in the event of a potentially life-threatening overdose and instruct caregivers on proper use and administration. For detailed information on dosing and administration of naloxone, please go to the Prescribe to Prevent website Enroll in and access CURES reports to establish whether or not an individual is receiving controlled substances from multiple prescribers. The CURES report should be requested frequently for patients who are being treated for pain and/or addiction. References 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Detailed information, the clinical background and rationale for each recommendation can be found in the full report. htt p://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CDC -2015- 0112- 0002 Det ermining for Chronic Pain 1.Nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy are preferred for chronic pain. Providers should only consider adding opioid therapy if expected benefits for both pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient (recommendation category: A, evidence type 3). 2.Before starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, providers should establish treatment goals with all patients, including realistic goals for pain and function. Providers should not initiate opioid therapy without consideration of how therapy will be discontinued if unsuccessful. Providers should continue opioid therapy only if there is clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function that outweighs risks to patient safety (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4). 3.Before starting and periodically during opioid therapy, providers should discuss with patients known risks and realistic benefits of opioid therapy and patient and provider responsibilities for managing therapy (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 3). Op ioid Selection, Dosage, Duration, Follow -Up, and Discontinuation 4.When starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, providers should prescribe immediate - release opioids instead of extended -release/long -acting evidence type: 4). 5.When opioids are started, providers should prescribe the lowest effective dosage. Providers should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should implement additional precautions when increasing dosage to 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day, and should generally avoid increasing dosage to 90 MME/ day (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 3). APPENDIX D Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 696. Long- term opioid use often begins with treatment of acute pain. When opioids are used for acute pain, providers should prescribe the lowest effective dose of immediate -release opioids and should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. Three or fewer days usually will be sufficient for most nontraumatic pain not related to major surgery (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4). 7. Providers should evaluate benefits and harms with patients within 1 to 4 weeks of starting opioid therapy for chronic pain or of dose escalation. Providers should evaluate benefits and harms of continued therapy with patients every 3 months or more frequently. If benefits do not outweigh harms of continued opioid therapy, providers should work with patients to reduce opioid dosage and to discontinue opioids (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4). Assessing Risk and Addressing Harms of Opioid Use 8. Before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, providers should evaluate risk factors for opioid -related harms. Providers should incorporate into the management plan strategies to mitigate risk, including considering offering naloxone when factors that increase risk for opioid overdose, such as history of overdose, history of substance use disorder, or higher opioid dosages ( 50 MME), are present (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4). 9. Providers should review the patient's history of controlled substance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data to determine whether the patient is receiving high opioid dosages or dangerous combinations that put him or her at high risk for overdose. Providers should review PDMP data when starting opioid therapy for chronic pain and periodically during opioid therapy for chronic pain, ranging from every prescription to every 3 months (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4). 10. When prescribing opioids for chronic pain, providers should use urine drug testing before starting opioid therapy and consider urine drug testing at least annually to assess for prescribed medications as well as other controlled prescription drugs and illicit drugs (recommendation category: B, evidence type: 4). 11. Providers should avoid prescribing opioid pain medication for patients receiving benzodiazepines whenever possible (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 3). Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 7012. Providers should offer or arrange evidence -based treatment (usually medication - assisted treatment with buprenorphine or methadone in combination with behavioral therapies) for patients with opioid use disorder (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 3).

The implications of this struggle are widespread and involve many individuals and institutions including healthcare policymakers. State Medicaid pharmacy programs, in particular, undergo significant scrutiny of their programs to curtail this problem.While recent efforts have been made by government agencies to both quantify and offermethods for curbing this issue, it still falls to each state's policymakers to protect its resources and the population it serves from the consequences of misuse and abuse. This paper details the history of one state Medicaid's management of this issue at the pharmacy benefit level.Examples of various methods employed and the results are outlined and commentary isprovided for each method. Regardless of the methods used to address this issue, the problem must still be a priority at all levels, not just for payers.Keywords Health spending, healthcare policy, Medicaid, opioid abuse, prescription diversion, public health, state issues, substance abuse History Received 6 June 2014 Revised 7 November 2014 Accepted 10 November 2014 Published online 8 December 2014 Introduction The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) stated in January 2012 that state Medicaid programs areseeing increases in drug diversion (defined as:''diversion oflicit drugs for illicit purposes'') (1). Diversion is a form ofprescription drug abuse. Use of prescription drugs for reasonsother than originally intended or by persons other than forwhom prescribed can be considered misuse and abuse. Thisstruggle with misuse and abuse of prescription opioids is not new. The problem is societal in nature, with implications for all entities from individuals to governments. The source andpayment of prescription products abused makes prescriptionopioid misuse and abuse unique compared to other types ofillicit drug use (2). Though theft is one way for prescriptiondrugs to end up ''on the street'', diversion through normaldistribution channels also occurs. When such diversionoccurs, payment for the prescription products is often through legitimate third party payers such as commercial or govern- ment-sponsored insurance, like Medicaid or Medicare (1). Ina study by McAdam-Marx et al., costs for Medicaid patientswith abuse/dependence-related diagnoses were higher thancosts for patients without a related diagnosis. The authorssuggest interventions targeted at preventing abuse andmanaging comorbidities in these patients can reduce costsand potential abuse (3). Suggested methods for intervention were proposed by Katz et al. based on a meeting sponsored by Tufts Health Care Institute Program on Opioid Risk Management. Proposed methods included pharmacy and prescriber controls, promo-tion of abuse-deterrent opioid products, monitoring ofprescription claims, data sharing among insurance providers,and promoting strategies at the provider level to reduce risk ofabuse (2). Over the past 10 years, Oklahoma Medicaid (MOK) has considered misuse and abuse of prescription narcotics a priority area of concern. At least nine unique prescription policies for opioid products were recommended by the DrugUtilization Review (DUR) Board and implemented by theOklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA)with the goal ofdecreasing misuse and abuse of opioids. The objective of thispaper was to discuss the historical steps which MOK hastaken to limit potential misuse and abuse of opioids. Review of Oklahoma Medicaid policies The policies that the DUR Board developed for OHCA'sSoonerCare pharmacy benefit program are listed in Table 1 anddiscussed further below. Each policy has an alphabeticalidentifier which correlates with the graph in Figure 1. Thisfigure demonstrates the trend in opioid prescription claimsover time. The vertical lines on Figure 1 indicate the points ofpolicy implementation.

The limit is typically set based on maximumdaily dosage or duration approved by the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA). The first opioid products givenquantity limits by MOK butorphanol products, hydromorphone,methadone, meperidine, and oxycodone immediate and controlled-release products in October 2003 (Table 1, Identifier A). Quantity limits were applied to other productsin subsequent years until all opioid products were included(Table 1, Identifier G). Pharmacy Lock-In program Lock-In programs, common to all Medicaid and some commercial insurance plans, typically function by creating aprescription gatekeeper for beneficiaries who are deemed to have potential for misuse of their prescription benefits based on their prescription and medical services utilization history.Most programs include at minimum a restriction to a singlepharmacy for these beneficiaries and may include a singlephysician source that also controls access to other health careservices. A few states restrict members to a specific hospitalfor emergency services. While the research regarding theeffectiveness of these programs is limited, the stateswhich studied their effect found reductions in opioid utiliza-tion (4-6). MOK transferred the responsibility for the program to their DUR vendor in January 2006 (Table 1, Identifier B). Anevaluation of the program found mean monthly opioid prescriptions were reduced after a beneficiary was locked-in to a single pharmacy, with no apparent effect on non-opioidrelated medications (7). The results of the analysis indicatedthe average per member per month (PMPM) number of opioidprescription claims decreased by 0.09 ( p50.0001) while there was no statistically significant change in the PMPM forthe number of medications considered by the MOK DURBoard as maintenance for chronic disease states (Figure 1, Identifier B). However, this study was unable to determine if the Lock-In program changed actual behavior outside of thepatients' Medicaid prescription usage because the programadministrators were not authorized to review the Oklahoma Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data, abarrier which remains. Even though dispensers of controlled substances are required to report details of the transaction tothe PDMP within 5 minutes, it does not change prescribing when a practitioner is not routinely checking the PDMP (8,9). Prior authorization programs Several prior authorizations (PA) of single opioid prescription products were implemented (Table 1, Identifiers C, I, and K).The PA process for MOK typically consists of manualrequests initiated by the physician or pharmacy for theTable 1.

Individual products included weretramadol extended-release (C), buprenorphine (I), and genericoxymorphone extended-release (K). Step therapy programs Step therapy programs are PA programs which MOK utilizes for entire classes of medications. These programs require theuse of products designated as first step before use of second orthird step products. An example is requiring use of immedi-ate-release generic opioid medications in opioid-na \u00a8ve patients before moving to extended-release products. Steptherapy programs can use manual or automated (computer generated) approvals for products placed on ''higher'' steps. Step therapy was implemented on the entire class of opioidprescription products in July 2008 (Table 1, Identifier E). Theintent of this step therapy was increased use of short-termimmediate release products for acute pain situations andbreakthrough therapy for chronic pain situations and reservinglong-acting opioids for opioid tolerant patients. Preferredlong-acting generic products were established as the second step before patients were allowed to move to the third step of non-preferred long-acting brand products. Preferred and non-preferred short-acting categories were also established.This policy resulted in a reduction in utilization of secondand third step products (10); however, research was notperformed to measure other possible outcomes such as anincrease in overall short-acting use over preferred long-actingproducts. Prospective drug utilization review MOK first used Prospective DUR POS programming in 2007 to limit prescriptions for hydrocodone to one claim per daysupply, thus allowing a patient to have only one prescriptionfor a hydrocodone containing product at a time (Table 1,Identifier D). In 2009, MOK implemented a second Prospective DUR ingredient duplication which examines prescription claims as they are submitted for hydrocodone-containing products and reviews each patient's medicationprofile to determine if hydrocodone products from previousprescription claims are still available to the patient (Table 1,Identifier F). If a duplication of hydrocodone is found, thenthe new claim rejects at POS and an override is required forclaim payment. This POS programming resulted in approxi- mately 70 000 denied claims in the first year (11). However, it is unknown if pharmacies dispensed these products to thepatients as cash transactions. Limit on number of prescriptions An additional POS programming method was implemented based on the number of hydrocodone prescriptions filledduring a 360-day period (Table 1, Identifier H). This programming limits patients to 13 prescriptions per year unless authorization is granted and resulted in just over 28 000 denied prescription claims for hydrocodone the first reporting year after implementation (12). Again, it is not knownwhether patients received the prescriptions on a cash basisfrom the dispensing pharmacies.Preferred brand prior authorization Recently a preferred brand PA was initiated for the new abuse- deterrent formulation of oxymorphone extended-release (Table1, Identifier K). Abuse-deterrent products are formulated todecrease the likelihood of abuse by targeting known orpotential routes for each specific product. This PA restrictslower-cost generic versions of the original brand product andallows only use of the new abuse-deterrent brand. There has notbeen sufficient time to determine if this policy will result in decreased misuse of oxymorphone in the MOK population. Age restrictions A final POS programming method was implemented on opioid products based on the patient's age (Table 1, IdentifierL). These age restrictions were placed on products containinghydrocodone and allow the liquid formulations for use bychildren and the solid oral products for use by adolescents and adults. The objective of this policy was to limit the more costly liquid formulations to the most appropriate age group. Exceptions are allowed for members with physical disabilitieswho require non-solid dosage forms. Prescriber contract requirement Previously, prescriptions written by any licensed prescriber could be covered by the MOK pharmacy benefit. However, aspart of compliance with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), in 2011, MOK restricted payment of pharmacy claims to those written by prescribers contracted to serve MOKmembers(Table 1, Identifier J). The rationale for the contractrequirement was based on patterns noticed by states and CMSof narcotic utilization by members with prescriptions writtenby non-contracted prescribers. If the prescriber was notcontracted and thus not being paid by the Medicaid agenciesfor office visits, they must have been charging patients directly for services. Additionally, prescribers were under no obligation to comply with agency policy or submit patientrecords upon request. Discussion Oklahoma was in the highest category of state prescriptiondrug overdose age-adjusted death rates in 2008 (15.8 per100 000 compared to the national average of 11.9 per 100 000) (13). Faced with the significant issue of opioid abuse in the state, policymakers through MOK have attemptedto curb misuse by implementing various policies over timewithin the pharmacy benefit. The number of different policiesenacted by MOK reflects efforts to curtail misuse and abuse without interference where high utilization of opioid products may be medically appropriate. Although it is not within thescope of this report to determine if these efforts had an overall effect on the state, it is interesting to highlight some changes in mortality rates in Oklahoma. According to a report in 2013by the Oklahoma Department of Health, unintentionalpoisoning mortality rates for Oklahoma increased signifi-cantly over the US average from 1999-2010. Oklahoma alsosaw an increase in the number of prescribed opioids duringthis time period and prescription opioids remained the mostcommon product listed in unintentional poisoning deaths.DOI: 10.3109/00952990.2014.988339 Strategies to control prescription opioid abuse 3Downloaded by [170.253.164.22] at 05:24 30 September 2015 Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 74And although mortality rates increased for all ages over the entire time period reported, it can be noted that there was anincrease from 16.0 in 2007 to 17.7 in 2009 but a subsequentdecrease in the rate to 17.2 by 2011. Likewise, there was a decrease in the number of deaths attributed to prescription drugs from 2009-2011 (14). Unfortunately while heroinappears to be an increasing issue of concern nationally (15),Oklahoma currently is not able to clearly distinguish heroindeaths from other morphine-related deaths and it is unclearwhether heroin use is replacing prescription opioid use inOklahoma as it is in other areas of the US. MOK, in conjunction with its DUR Board, believes that misuse and abuse of these substances is an important societalissue and should be confronted at all intersections of the lives of these individuals, not just at an insurer level. Reachingpatients before misuse and abuse occurs is vital. However,MOK has implemented and continues to implement policieswhich are intended to limit potential misuse and abuse whileproviding good stewardship of resources and maintainingpositive health outcomes. Programmatic implications of policy changes For MOK, basic restrictions such as quantity limits, number of prescriptions, and limits based on age, may be most effective interms of reducing numbers of paid prescription claims forproducts. While these restrictions are not difficult to imple-ment, maintain, and operate, they do result in additional questions to call centers and higher PA or claim override volumes. These restrictions also place a higher burden onphysicians and pharmacies if they wish to move forward with payment of the prescription claim by MOK. An additionallimitation of these programs occurs when the dispensingpharmacy simply instructs the patient that the prescription isnot covered by MOK and does not attempt to receivereimbursement by MOK for potentially legitimate claims. The result is patients not receiving necessary prescriptions or patients paying out-of-pocket for appropriate opioid prescrip- tions. PAs and step therapy programs are more complicated toimplement and maintain, with step therapy being the mostdifficult to continually monitor. They also generate highernumbers of phone calls and PA requests. For instance, when thestep therapy program was implemented, the number of priorauthorizations for opioid products increased from approxi- mately 100 requests monthly to 400 requests monthly. The current average number of requests for this category for allreasons is 650 per month. Based on a recent analysis ofOHCA's prior authorization program, the cost for each PA inOklahoma is $12.50 (lower than the national benchmark) (16).If implemented today, the step therapy program would havecost the state an additional $3750 per month. A simple PA on asingle product such as buprenorphine typically requires a manual review and approval for all initial prescription requests. Products which are placed in step therapy typically have automated pathways which are processed at POS by the claims processing software. Of these two methods, the manual PAprocess typically results in the highest reduction in approvedprescription claims due to the review by clinical pharmacists.Automated approvals are limited to more explicit criteria anddo not allow for clinical judgment.Outcome evidence from policy implementation Some first efforts at curbing misuse in the Medicaid system were the Lock-In programs. As early as 1977, Singletonpublished a review of the effects of state Lock-In programs,reporting that the Missouri Medicaid Lock-In program mayhave reduced the 1976 state Medicaid budget by 1.7% (or $1.8million) (5). The Hawaii Medicaid Lock-In program esti-mated a total of $909 992 in saving for 1983 (4). And a reviewby Blake in 1999 of the Louisiana Medicaid Lock-In program showed reductions in multiple pharmacies, poly-pharmacy, opioid analgesics and overall pharmacy expenditures (6). Lock-In programs have appeared once again on the national radar. In August 2012, the Center for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) convened an expert panel to discuss''Medicaid Patient Review and Restriction (PRR)'' (or Lock-In) programs. The final report issued after this panel meetingconcluded that PRRs are important programs to reduce accidental deaths, particularly for Medicaid patients (17). In December 2012, researchers at the University of California,Davis prepared a report for the CDC which evaluated the costand health impacts of PRR programs. A tool was developedthat simulated patterns of opioid use and evaluated the resultsof different restriction policies on health outcomes and costs.The goal is to allow state policy makers to improve theirdecision making using evidence-based information and allow specific state reviews of current or proposed PRR programs (19). Finally, the preferred brand PA is a new area for consideration. Medicaid programs may achieve lower netcosts for brand name drugs than generics when one of thefollowing situations occurs: (1) Brand product has a high federally mandated rebate which renders the net cost below that of the generic; or (2) Brand product has a sufficient supplemental rebate from the drug manufacturer paid directly to the state whichrenders the net product cost below that of the generic. These situations typically occur when only one manufac-turer's generic is available on the market; however thesesituations might also arise when multiple manufacturers'products are available. However in the case of the preferredbrand for oxymorphone extended-release, the policy imple-mentation is based on the expectation that the new abuse-deterrent formulation will decrease misuse and abuse of theproduct. The result of this new ''experimental'' policy requires further review. As previously mentioned under Lock-In programs, MOK under current state law does not have the legal authority to examine and review the PDMP data. Only providers of care(prescribers and pharmacies) and law enforcement officialshave access to PDMP data. This creates a significanthindrance in attempts to evaluate programmatic initiativesto impact abuse and misuse outside of MOK financial responsibility for these prescriptions. From a public health perspective, the goal of program initiatives is to improve thehealth of plan members by decreasing or eliminating opioidabuse, not to just avoid financial responsibility for abuse.Access to the PDMP would allow MOK and other payers tocoordinate monitoring and treatment activities with 4 S. L. Keast et al. Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse, 2015; 41(1): 1-6Downloaded by [170.253.164.22] at 05:24 30 September 2015 Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 75prescribers and pharmacies even when patients elected to pay cash and avoid plan oversight. Figure 1 displays the opioid prescription claims per utilizer per month (PUPM) from January 2003 through June 2013. PUPM is a measure based on the number of enrollees who utilize the benefit; this number is a subset of the entireenrolled population. Several events affected the total popu-lation of MOK during the time period, including carve-in of amanaged care program (January 2004) and carve-out of duallyeligible Medicare beneficiaries as a result of Medicare Part D(January 2006). However, by reviewing the claim PUPM foropioids, the effect of the changes in the overall utilizer base is reduced. Upon review, the most noticeable change in the trend is the drop in claims PUPM after the step therapy program was initiated in July 2008. While not all of the policies MOK implemented over the years were evaluated either for safety and effectiveness or forcost savings, several were. The Prospective DUR duplicationof hydrocodone-containing products was estimated to have anannualized cost avoidance of $325 755 (2010 US$) (11). The hydrocodone annual prescription limit was estimated to have an annualized cost avoidance of $83 823 (2011 US$) (12).Overall, the Lock-In program was estimated to have an annualcost reduction of $606 (2006 US$) per locked-in member permonth (7). Finally, the restriction of prescribers to thosecontracted with OHCA, resulted in a decrease of 6% in overall opioid prescription claims (19). Efforts at limiting misuse and abuse of opioid prescriptions are necessary regardless of payer type. Not only do misuse and abuse of opioid prescriptions contribute to rising healthcarecosts, but unchecked misuse and abuse will ultimately lead to addiction for the patient, and/or to fraud on the part of thepatient and possibly the provider. Currently MOK is planningto review more of its policies for opioid prescription misuseand abuse. It is hoped that the policy preferring the abuse-deterrent formulation will result in a slower uptake of the generic product by those seeking to misuse it. Although the step therapy program shifted market share from the highest tier to the lower tiers, concern remains over whether this programmay have increased use of short-acting opioid products. According to CMS, opioid abuse and diversion is a leading problem faced by all state Medicaid programs (1). In a studydone in Kentucky by Manchikanti et al. on 400 patientstreated at a pain management clinic, when compared to commercial insurance, Medicare only, and Medicare and Medicaid (dually eligible), those in the Medicaid-only grouphad the highest percentage of patients with illicit drug use(39%). Additionally, the Medicaid-only group had the highestcombined rate of both illicit drug use and inappropriate use ofprescription drugs (60%) (20). CMS partners with the DrugEnforcement Agency (DEA) and state agencies to promoteappropriate use of opioid prescriptions. A law enacted in October 2008 established a ''tamper-resistant'' prescription paper policy for all non-electronic prescriptions written for Medicaid outpatient drugs. Further, the ACA includes add- itional measures which can be used to combat abuse. Thesenew measures are: ''establish enhanced oversight for newproviders, establish periods of enrollment moratoria or otherlimits on providers identified as being high risk for fraud andabuse, establish enhanced provider screening, and requirestates to suspend payment when there is a credible allegationof fraud which may include evidence of overprescribing bydoctors, overutilization by recipients, or questionable medicalnecessity'' (1). CMS also promotes measures which states can incorporate to detect abuse: using retrospective DUR processes to identify potential patterns of abuse, improvingprospective DUR screenings at POS for high opioid doses orpotential overuse, reviewing prescriptions written at painmanagement clinics, searching for fraud across programs,forming collaborative workgroups with other state agenciesand neighboring states, using PDMPs, developing new orenhanced Medicaid patient Lock-In programs, promoting the national ''Take-Back'' campaign, and encouraging both providers and patients to take appropriate steps to safeguardtheir identities (1). Recommendations Any payer contemplating actions similar to MOK should carefully consider the potential for increased work load totheir current staff and the overall healthcare system whenplanning their policies. In general, each of the policies implemented by MOK achieved the desired result in the short term. It is the experience of these policymakers that as oneproduct or sub-category is identified and acted upon, anotherquickly takes its place. Therefore it is not enough to simplyimplement a policy and consider this complicated problemsolved. Simultaneous implementation of multiple policiesmay have a higher initial effect on opioid utilization; however,as with most policies, these effects may be greatest in the shortterm. And while policies may seem to meet short-term goals, review of the outcomes for unintended clinicalconsequences should also occur (21). The current epidemic should be addressed on the patient level in areas unrelated to prescription utilization. Payersshould ensure that addiction treatment and counseling servicesare readily available and affordable. Nationally, programsshould continue encouraging people to seek help or encoura- ging family members to seek help for loved ones. Most people do not plan to become physically and psychologically addictedto prescription pain medications and should not face stigmawhen seeking treatment. Payers should address the provider side of this epidemic. Analysis of physician prescribing patterns is necessary tocontrol misuse and abuse of opioid prescription drugs. Whenprescribing patterns are reviewed in combination with a thorough physician peer quality panel assessment, a higher impact on prescribing may be possible. State boards ofmedical licensure must become more active in monitoringnarcotic prescribing patterns and in providing assistance aswell as disciplinary measures when needed. Informationprovided by payers should be used by physicians to reviewand revise their prescribing habits, and not assumed to bepunitive or invasive. Only by working together can we prevent serious problems before they arise. Regardless of the nature of policies for deterring misuse and abuse of opioid prescription drugs, it is imperative that these efforts continue and results from these policies beshared across payer types. To that end, the CDC and theNational Institutes of Health - National Institute on DrugDOI: 10.3109/00952990.2014.988339 Strategies to control prescription opioid abuse 5Downloaded by [170.253.164.22] at 05:24 30 September 2015 Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver:3) - January 2016 - Page 76Abuse (NIH-NIDA) are currently funding research to deter- mine the impact of policies such as those outlined above oninappropriate prescribing of opioids (22). Conclusions Despite multiple efforts currently in effect for the pharmacybenefit, misuse and abuse of prescription opioids continues.As health plans, regulatory agencies, and law enforcementofficials introduce more complex countermeasures, a thor-ough review of new policies should be performed todetermine their effectiveness so others may adopt successfulpolicies and avoid poor or overly expensive options. With newabuse-deterrent formulations for long-acting products coming to market, real-world evaluations are needed to determine whether these products effectively reduce misuse, or simplydivert users to other drugs of abuse. Only by continuedcombined effort to treat not only abuse, but also to intervenebefore more devastating consequences occur, can we begin toconquer this serious social problem which touches us all.
