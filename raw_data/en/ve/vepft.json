Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program Assistant Commissioner, Christopher Shields, BS, EMT -PBureau of Public Health Preparedness and Emergency Response Initiated within Chicago in 2002 to develop plans for health & medical consequences of disasters Focus on vulnerable and at -risk populations Facilitates pharmaceutical and medication ancillary distribution Close collaboration with various city agencies and offices: The Mayor's Office The Office of Emergency Management & Communication Emergency Responders (Fire, Police, Paramedics) Hospitals (Hospital Preparedness Program) Coordinates with local organizations and coalitions to empower the public to take action 2Public Health Potential Emergencies Severe weather Special events Communicable or Infectious Disease Pandemic capable disease Chemical, Biological, Radiological release Contamination of water or food supplies Synthetic narcotics or recreational drugs 3Preparedness All measures taken before an event occurs Preparedness includes: Defining the potential threats Developing All -Hazard management strategies Coordination of Organizational roles Conducting drills and exercises Evaluation and Improvement planning 4Planning / Exercise 5Planning The city of Chicago utilizes various data components to inform the construction of programming, plans, polices and procedures. The activities drive training, which drives exercises, which drives corrective actions. The Chicago Department of Public Health captures the population framework (Health Indicators) through our Healthy Chicago 2.0 program: https://www.chicagohealthatlas.org/ Population density Economic Hardship Race / Ethnicity / Spoken Language Area resources (Health / Food / Services, etc.) Underlying disease trends and other social determinants All of the data points inform predictive planning to support our population during emergencies, but allow for specific modifications based on the incident dynamics, i.e., Cold / Heat, Civil Unrest, Outbreaks 6Planning Once we capture the data sets (indicators), we visualize the city via heat mapping, turning layers on / off to better understand potential impacts to community areas or targeted populations. Through planning scenarios and our Threat Hazard Analysis, we apply predictive analytics to identify positive and negative impacts on our city, based on the planning assumptions and the underlying data sets. For seasonal influenza as the example, we utilize previous years data (negative impacts or outcomes) to inform response changes to the upcoming season: Did we see outbreaks in specific setting (Schools, Congregate housing, Churches, etc.) Did we see unusual clusters of disease, outside of the baseline groups Did hospitalizations trend as expected against virulence of disease burden What additional co -morbidities, social or environmental conditions impact response operations 7Pandemic Influenza Annex Chicago maintains an active Pandemic Influenza plan / annex as part of our Communicable Disease program, which undergoes internal / external peer review with our strategic partners (Emergency Management, Fire / EMS and trusted coalition partners) every 2 years, in alignment with EOP refreshes This annex was amended and reviewed as part of the Crimson Contagion \"All of Nation\" exercise during the summer / fall of 2019 Annex is built based on two novel influenza categories (Spanish Flu - high mortality and the H1N1 Pandemic -low mortality) Unlike many plans, this document was built as a decision matrix structure; providing \"Courses of Action\" discussion points, spread across an 18 -month pandemic timeline 8Crimson Contagion Exercise A National Full -Scale Exercise undertaken during August 13 -16th, 2019, which involved multiple Chicago Departments and Sister agencies, 17 states, and multiple Federal agencies to focus on a Pandemic Influenza (H7N9) incident. The exercise series included local Tabletop Exercises, a Federal Seminar, and a Functional Full -Scale Exercise. 9Crimson Contagion: Goals 2019 Chicago co -authored and participated in the \"All of Government\" Pandemic Influenza Exercise series \"Crimson Contagion\" to: Examine what administrative and fiscal actions are required by the City of Chicago to initiate and sustain coordinated response actions during a Pandemic Influenza Incident. Examine available coordination mechanisms between HHS/CDC, IDPH and CDPH to develop priority groups, incident specific messaging and medication protocols (anti - viral, vaccine, etc.) for a sustained Pandemic Influenza response (assumes event duration 9 -18 months) Examine the effectiveness of adapting CDPH/IDPH and CDC/HHS communicable disease surveillance systems and tools to address a pandemic influenza response. Examine the Political, Economic, Social and Health impacts associated to the implementation of Non -Pharmaceutical Interventions to the public and at -risk populations, to include but not limited to: School, University and venue closures within the city of Chicago. 10Crimson Contagion: CDPH Activities Initiate a local Public Health Emergency (Declaration), follow -on to MPO, OEMC and Governor's office Activate our cached resources and deploy Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to 12 hospitals (self - selected for exercise) Conduct multiple conference calls with local stake -holders, while generating guidance, press releases and safety messaging Initiate Federal resource requests for medical materiels (anti -viral pharmaceuticals, PPE, etc.), and fiscal support through existing grant streams and an available Crisis Notice of Funding Opportunity with CDC. Initiate cost tracking of all resources for personnel, equipment and supplies. (costs projected to have exceeded 42 million at day 47) Validate a syndromic monitoring process, over -laid with GIS to identify geo -spatial clusters and work with our hospital partners to track First Responder illness rates Activation of our Fatality Management mobile morgues; to assist the Cook County Medical Examiner's office with the significant increase in local deaths. Convene Citywide senior leadership to discuss the need for non -pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and the closure of schools, universities and major venues.11Crimson Contagion: Lessons Learned Inventory Management Systems (IMS) were not utilized at the Federal level, indicating potential challenges for Chicago to receive and further deploy assets in an efficient manner Coordination calls (Federal, State and local applications); ability to quickly assemble necessary agencies engage in multi -layered strategy discussion were not efficient -requires follow -up Emergency Operations Coordination -highly effective locally, scaled activations (health to all of city) worked effectively, information dissemination broadly utilized Logistics mission could be highly dynamic; PPE, Oral medication and Vaccine sustainment through duration of campaign Examine the Political, Economic, Social and Health impacts associated to the implementation of Non -Pharmaceutical Interventions to the public and at -risk populations, to include but not limited to: School, University and venue closures within the city of Chicago.
