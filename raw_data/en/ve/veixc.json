What Nuvaxovid is and what it is used for Nuvaxovid is a vaccine used to prevent COVID -19 caused by the SARS -CoV -2 virus. Nuvaxovid is given to individuals 12 years of age and older. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, to give protection agai nst COVID -19. None of the ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID -19. 2. What you need to know before you receive Nuvaxovid Nuvaxovid should not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine ( listed in section 6). Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given Nuvaxovid if: you have ever had a severe or life -threatening allergic reaction after receiving any other vaccine injection or after you were given Nuvaxovid in the past, you have ever fainted following any needle injection, you have a high fever (over 38\u00b0C) or severe infection. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold, you have bleedi ng problems, you bruise easily , or you use a medicine to prevent blood clots, your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you are taking medicines that weaken the immune system (such as high -dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or cancer medicines). 2 There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Nuvaxovid (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a f ew days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should the se occur. If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given Nuvaxovid. As with any vaccine, the 2 -dose vaccination course of Nuvaxovid may not fully protect all those who receive it , and it is not known how long you will be protected.
