With communities fully engaged and actively participating through the full cycle of planning, delivery and assessment for new biomedical tools, demand for these tools can be increased, leading to widespread and effective uptake and use. The empowerment of people and communities is not an abstract idea and there are concrete and measurable steps that can be taken to ensure citizens are engaged and ready to support new biomedical tools. Though communication needs may be slightly different for each tool, the principles that promote their safe and successful introduction remain the same. The following 10 steps are well established risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) principles that have proven their power. Together, they put communities at the heart of the roll-out of new vaccines, treatments and tests, and promote trust - the critical ingredient for all community action. Informed, engaged and empowered communities are the bedrock for the arrival of new vaccines, treatments and tests that will be introduced to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and save lives 3 People are more likely to take action if they are involved in decision- making. Engage communities early and work to involve, collaborate and empower them. Leave no community behind. MaKe deCISIoNS aBoUt tHe PeoPLe, WItH tHe PeoPLe g Initiate discussions with communities to understand sociocultural contexts and power dynamics. Map networks and influencers in the community. g Identify what type of engagement interventions are safe, feasible and acceptable. 1STEP 4 Coordinate action through the widest set of stakeholders possible. A whole- of-society approach works best. Trust brings communities together for action and is paramount for the delivery of health care and services. MaINtaIN & S t R e NG t H e N t RUSt tHRoUGH F oRMaL aNd INFoRMaL CoNN e Ct I o NS g Activate or strengthen RCCE coordination mechanisms and use existing health and response structures to support health system readiness at all levels. Ensure representation of civil society and vulnerable groups. Work closely with other committees and advisory groups such as the National Immunization Advisory Group. g Launch or strengthen an independent national \"alliance\" of influencers and stakeholders who can listen, advocate, educate, address rumours and misinformation, and build vaccine and health literacy. 2STEP 5 Regularly seek out and respond to feedback from communities. This improves the relationship and trust between communities and public health authorities. LISte N M o R e , ta LK L e SS g Establish community feedback mechanisms to promote accountability and ensure that community beliefs, questions, concerns and suggestions are heard. g Guide the continuous adaptation of the COVID-19 response in an effective, agile, safe and confidential manner.3STEP 4STEP 6 g Include community feedback, social listening, polling and survey data to best understand community knowledge gaps, perceptions and behaviours. g Use this knowledge to inform decision making at all levels. Social data give an important perspective on community knowledge gaps, perceptions and behaviours. Understanding the drivers of behaviour is also critical to understand why people may or may not be practising public health and social measures. For something as complex as human behaviour, a mix of data sources is best. USe data FoR deCISIoN-MaKING & Co URS e Co RR e Ct I o N 5STEP 7 g Ensure communities are involved in co-designing solutions. g Use social data analysis to develop and regularly review and update RCCE action plans. g Crisis communication preparedness plans should be developed as part of this process. PLaN, PL a N, PL a N WI t H t H e P eo PL e Community participation in planning can improve services, ensure services are equitable and help to remove barriers. This is especially important when introducing new tools and services such as vaccines, treatments or new types of tests. 6STEP 8 g Promote community participation in developing the monitoring and evaluation process. Include civil society and community groups in monitoring, reporting and joint accountability efforts to increase the likelihood of broad community uptake and responsibility for new interventions. Let tHe PeoPLe MeaSURe SUCC eSS We have learned over time that widespread community participation in monitoring and evaluation supports programme sustainability and promotes joint accountability and best use of resources. 7STEP 9 g Carefully map where RCCE expertise is needed and recruit immediately. g Establish RCCE leadership at all levels with the necessary authority to coordinate partners. g If not already established, introduce and enforce Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for RCCE as a central coordination and quality assurance tool. HIRe & eMPoW e R M o R e RCC e eXPe Rt IS e Risk Communication and Community Engagement support provides the critical links between communities and health services. This expertise supports national authorities in making informed decisions to prepare and protect the health of individuals and the community. 8STEP 10 g For best results, initiate a continuous peer-to-peer support system for community mobilizers and networks. BUILd CaPaCI ty & deV e L o P SKILLS to Go BeyoNd CoVI d -19 Training of the community health workforce allows local issues to be solved locally. Include frontline workers, volunteers, community leaders and community/social mobilizers from civil society organizations, faith-based organizations, local women and youth groups in capacity-building events for long-term sustainability. 9STEP 11 g Ensure access to trusted information and effectively manage misinformation and rumours. g Activate or strengthen national fact- checking and rumour-monitoring capacity recognizing, that rumours and misinformation can be as dangerous as COVID-19. MaNaG e t H e INF ode MIC An infodemic is an overabundance of information - good or bad - that makes it difficult for people to make decisions for their health. The COVID-19 infodemic can harm health. 10STEP 12 g Establish and agree on priority communication channels with communities as soon as possible. g Where possible, adapt science and health messaging to new contexts with communities.
