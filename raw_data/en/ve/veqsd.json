It uses small doses of substances found in nature to stimulate the body's natural healing capacity. In your homeopathy appointment, your doctor will listen to your story and strive to understand your pattern of physical, mental and emotional symptoms and your unique way of experiencing the world. With this pattern in mind, she will prescribe a homeopathic remedy that is tailored to you, not to your diagnosis. The central philosophy of homeopathy is the law of similars which states that Like Cures Like. Each of the available homeopathic remedies has been studied individually and found to cause a certain, unique pattern of symptoms when taken in excess. When a remedy is given in very low doses to a person who is experiencing that same symptom pattern for which the remedy is known, it is able to bring about healing. The remedy essentially delivers a \"packet\" of information to your system, describing a stuck symptom pattern that your body has been playing out over and over. When the correct remedy is given, your body is able to receive this information and make adjustments, leading to improvement or resolution of symptoms and an overall strengthening of your constitution. Homeopathic remedies are quite safe, non-allergenic and non-toxic. They are prepared by homeopathic pharmacies from botanical, animal and mineral substances. Start with homeopathy if you are: - Feeling stalled in your pathway to healing. - Looking for a highly tailored approach that addresses and works with the unique way you experience your health concerns. - Noticing the same stuck symptom patterns (whether emotional, mental or physical) playing out over and over again. - Sensitive to many supplements and herbs and looking for a different approach. - Experiencing odd or quirky symptoms that nobody can explain. Note: This service is only available at the Lacey location. PRICING FOR HOMEOPATHIC CONSULTATIONS: - $260: Initial 60-minute session - $175: 1-hour follow up "}
