China 14 15 Abstract 16 Background: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deat h in women 17 worldwide. Hirudin has been shown to inhibit the growth and me tastasis of several 18 types of cancers in experimental tumor models. However, whether hirudin exerts 19 antitumor effects on breast adenocarcinoma cells has not yet been investigated. The 20 objective of this study was to evaluate the antitumor eff ects and explore the 21 underlying mechanisms of hirudin in breast adenocarcinoma MCF- 7 cells. 22 Methods: The viability of MCF-7 cells was assayed by Cell Counting Kit- 8. The 23 adhesion ability of the cells was evaluated by cell adhesio n assay. Besides, cell 24 migration was detected by wound healing assay. Cell invasion was examined using 25 Transwell chamber assay. The underlying molecular mechanism was investigated by 26 immunofluorescence . In addition, In vivo zebrafish xenogra ft model was used to 27 verify the proliferation and metastasis of hirudin on MCF -7 cells. 28 Results: The results showed that hirudin significantly inhibited th e cell viability and 29 suppressed cell adhesion, migration , invasion compared with the control group . 30 Importantly, hirudin significantly decreased the expressi on of CHD1L , MDM2 31 protein, and increased the expression of p53 protein. Moreove r, the zebrafi sh 32 xenograft study revealed that hirudin inhibited the proliferat ion and metastasis of 33 MCF-7 cells in vivo. 34 Conclusion: The present findings demonstrate that hirudin suppressed metast asis of 35 MCF-7 cells and the mechanism may involve with the CHD1L/M DM2/p53 axis. 36 Hirudin is a promising antineoplastic agent for the treatm ent of breast cancer with 37 significant antimetastatic activities. 38 Keywords: Breast cancer, Hirudin, Metastasis , Zebrafi sh, CHD1L 39 40 Introduction 41 Breast cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer (24.2% of the total cancer 42 cases) and the leading cause of cancer-related death (15% of the total cancer deaths) 43 among females worldwide in 2018[1]. Metastatic disease accounts for more than 90% 44 of breast cancer-related deaths. It has been reported t hat the occurrence of breast 45 cancer is closely related to the instability of the geno me, such as gene amplification, 46 deletion, mutation[2]. Therefore, it is of great significance to further study and reveal 47 the key targets and regulatory mechanisms of tumor metasta sis for seeking more 48 effective treatment. 49 Chromodomain helicase/A TP DNA binding protein 1-like gene (CHD1L) is a 50 member of the SNF-2 protein family, which exhibits an oncogeni c role during 51 malignant transformation[3]. CHD1L is overexpressed in many highly aggressive 52 tumors, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer and i ntrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 53 [4-6]. Therefore, CHD1L is a novel biomarker for predicting tumor progression, 54 prognosis, and survival. Murine double minute 2 (MDM2), an important downstream 55 target of CHD1L , is an oncogene closely related to malignant tumors . It is a 56 ubiquitin-protein ligase that is involved in the identificatio n of target proteins by 57 ubiquitin, leading to the degradation of target proteins thro ugh the proteasome. The 58 protein encoded by MDM2 can bind to p53 protein and negatively regulat e p53 59 protein . It leads to the inactivation of tumor suppressor gene p53, and ultimately 60 enhances the ability of cell transformation, proliferation and malignant transformation . 61 The first MDM2 inhibitor to enter human clinical trials, RG7112, can achieve good 62 pharmacokinetic properties by oral administration[7]. Meanwhile, the activation of p53, 63 the increase of p21 protein and the induction of apoptosis we re detected in tumor cells, 64 which effectively inhibited the growth of cancer cell lines[8]. In conclusion, CHD1L 65 promotes the progression of tumor cells through the MDM2/p53 si gnaling pathway. 66 Hirudin is the main active component of animal medicine hi rudo, and has 67 demonstrated antitumor effects in different types of tum ors including lung, laryngeal 68 cancer[9-10]. Thus, targeting hirudin is a promising strategy for the deve lopment of 69 anticancer therapeutic modalities. However, whether hirudin e xerts antitumor effects 70 on breast adenocarcinoma cells has not yet been investig ated. In the present study, we 71 evaluated the antitumor effects of hirudin and explored th e underlying mechanisms in 72 breast adenocarcinoma cells. We treated MCF-7 cells wi th various dosages of hirudin 73 and analyzed cell viability, adhesion, migration and invasio n. We additionally 74 assessed the proliferation and metastasis of hirudin on M CF-7 cells in vivo zebrafish 75 xenogra ft model. 76 Materials and Methods 77 Cell culture and reagents 78 The human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells were provide d by China 79 Infrastructure of Cell Line Resource. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium 80 (Gibco, USA) with 10% FBS (Gibco) plus 1% penicillin and streptomycin in a 81 CO 2 atmosphere at 37C. Hirudin (purity 95%) was purchased from Combination 82 Botai Biotechnology (Dalian, China). 83 Cell counting Kit-8 assay 84 The viability of breast adenocarcinoma cells was assayed by Cell Counting Kit-8 85 (CCK-8; Dojindo, Beijing, China) assay. First, 5\u00d7103cells/well were added to a 86 96-well plate, with 100l of suspe nsion in each well. Twenty-four hours after seeding, 87 the medium was replaced with media containing differe nt concentrations of hirudin 88 created through serial dilution. After culturing the cells for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h , 10 l 89 of CCK-8 solution was added to each well, and the cells were i ncubated for 30 min. 90 Optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm with a microplate reader, and the 91 inhibition rate was calculated as follows: Relative cell viability inhibition rate (%) = 92 Absorbance of experimental group/ Absorbance of control group) \u00d7 100%. 93 Cell adhesion assay 94 MCF7 cells were plated in 6-well culture dishes with or without hirudin and allowed 95 to adhere for 1 h. Subsequently, corresponding medium with non-adhered cel ls was 96 discarded and cells were gently washed twice with PBS in orde r to remove any 97 loosely attached cells. Adhered cells were then counted using a 0.1% crystal violet 98 staining solution at room temperature for 20 min subsequent to being fixed with 99 methanol for 30 min at room temperature. Data are expresse d as a percentage in 100 adhered cells treated with hirudin relative to the contro l cells. 101 Wound healing assay 102 Cell migration was analyzed using a wound healing assay. MCF7 ce lls (1.5\u00d7105) were 103 seeded onto 12 well plates until they reached con fluence. A scratch wound in 104 confl uent monolayer was made using a 10 \u00b5l sterile pipette tip. Sub sequent to 105 washing away all detached cells with PBS, the remaining cells were treated with or 106 without hirudin (0.5, 1, 2 mg/ml). Photographs were taken at 0 a nd 24 h after 107 treatment. 108 Transwell chamber assay 109 Invasion assay was performed using 24-well Transwell chambers wi th 8- m pore 110 filters (Corning, USA). The inserts were coated with a 50 mg/l Matrigel (1: 4 dilution, 111 BD, USA) and cultured at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. Cells (1\u00d7105/ml) suspended in 200 \u00b5l of 112 serum-free RPMI1640 medium were transferred to the upper chambe r, while 600 \u00b5 l 113 of RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 20% FBS (fetal bovine ser um) was added 114 to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. The medium was then discarded and 115 invaded cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal 116 violet. The invading cells were counted in 5 different random ly selected 200\u00d7 117 magnification fields under light microscopy. 118 Immunofluorescence 119 Cells at a density of 1\u00d7104 cells/well were seeded into 96-well plates. After exposure 120 to the indicated treatments, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min 121 at room temperature. Then, the cells were blocked with 5% goa t serum and 0.3% 122 Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h. After the blocking solution was as pirated, the cells were 123 incubated with a primary antibody against CHD1L (1:500, Abcam, U (1:100, Abcam , UK) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, the 125 cells were incubated with a fluorochrome-conjugated anti- rabbit secondary antibody 126 (1:1000, CST, US) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Subse quently, the cells 127 were stained with DAPI (Beyotime, Shangh ai, China) for 30 min. Images were 128 obtained under a fluorescence microscope. 129 Zebrafish embryos 130 Wild type AB strain of zebrafi sh (Danio rerio ) was obtained from Nanjing Xinjia 131 Biotechnology Co., Nanjing, China. Embryos were generated by natural pairwise 132 mating . Zebrafish es were cultured under photoperiod of 14 h light /10 h dark at 28 \u00b0 C. 133 After disinfection and washing, the fertilized eggs were trans ferred into zebrafish 134 embryo culture water. 135 In Vivo Antitumor Assay 136 Fluorescence-labeled MCF-7 cells were injected into the ab dominal perivitelline 137 space of zebrafish embryos with a nanoliter injector . The tumor-bearing embryos were 138 incubated at 0, 0.05, 0.5, 5 mg/mL hirudin 24 h after transplantation. Th e tumor 139 growth and metastasis were observed and imaged using fluoresce nce inverted 140 microscope (Nikon Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The mean fluorescen ce intensity was 141 analyzed using Image J software. 142 Statistical analysis 143 All data were expressed as means \u00b1Standard Deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was 144 performed by oneway analysis of variance based on Student's twotailed unpaired or Dunnett's comparisons GraphPad Prism 5.0 software 146 (GraphPad Software , CA, USA). ImagePro Plus software 6.0 ( Media Cybernetics, 147 Inc., Silver Spring, MD, USA) was used for processing images. A value of P<0.05 148 was considered to be a statistically significant difference for all tests. 149 150 Results 151 Hirudin inhibits the proliferation of MCF7 cells 152 The eect of hirudin on cell growth in human MCF7 cells was detected by CCK- 8 153 assay. After treatment with hirudin varying from 0.25 to 2mg/mL after 24, 48, and 72h, 154 the results revealed that cell viability was inhibited by hirud in compared with the 155 control group ( p<0.05) (Figure 1). 156 Hirudin suppresses the adhesion, migration and invasion of MCF7 cells 157 In the present study, a non specific cell adhesion assay was used to investigate the 158 effect of hirudin on cell attachment. Compared with the c ontrol group , hirudin 159 significantly inhibited the adhesion of MCF7 cells ( p<0.01) (Figure 2) . Wound 160 healing assay w as performed to determine the eects of hirudin on migration of 161 MCF7 cells . Migration of MCF7 cells treated with hirudin was blocked com pared 162 with the control group ( p<0.01) (Figure 3). In a consistent manner , hirudin suppressed 163 invasion of MCF7 cells ( p<0.01) (Figure 4) . Taken together, these results 164 demonstrated that hirudin by acting directly on MCF7 cells to inhibit the processes of 165 adhesion, migration and invasion. 166 Hirudin suppressed the protein levels of CHD1L and MDM2 , upregulated the 167 protein levels of p53 168 The expression of protein levels was detected by immunofluo rescence . As shown in 169 Figure 5, hirudin significantly decreased the expression of CHD1L , MDM2 protein , 170 and increased the expression of p53 protein ( p<0.05 or p<0.01). 171 Hirudin inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in the zebrafish xenogra ft model 172 In vivo zebrafish xenogra ft model was used to verify the proliferation and metastasis 173 of hirudin on MCF-7 cells. Fluorescence-labeled MCF-7 cel ls were localized by 174 fluorescence imaging and expression intensities were proce ssed with image analysis 175 software. Compared with the control group, hirudin (0.5-5mg/ mL) significantly 176 inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 cells , while 0.05mg/mL did not (Figures 6A metastatic incidences in tumor-bearing zebrafi shes 178 detected with concentration of hirudin (Figures 6C an d 6D) . 179 180 Discussion 181 Breast cancer usually has a poor clinical outcome and low s urvival rate due to high 182 rates of metastasis at a late stage of the tumor devel opment. Therefore, novel 183 approaches are urgently required for the treatment of this di sease and the prevention 184 of its metastasis[11]. Animal drugs have widely attracted attention due to their 185 preventative and treatment effects on cancer without se rious side effects in recent 186 years[12]. The results of the present study demonstrated that anima l medicine hirudin 187 served an important functional role in suppressing the invasi on and metastasis of 188 breast adenocarcinoma cells. 189 Cancer metastasis is a complicated multistep process invo lving the dissociation 190 of malignant cells at the primary sites, invasion thro ugh the extracellular matrix, 191 intravasation of invading cells into the vasculature or lymphatic systems, survival and 192 finally proliferation at a distant organ[13]. In the present study, it was revealed that the 193 cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion in MCF -7 cells decreased when 194 treated with hirudin. 195 We explored the possible explanation for its suppression o f human breast 196 adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells migration and invasion. Recent studies have shown tha t 197 CHD1L is related to proliferation, migration, invasion, an d metastasis of tumor 198 cells[14-15]. Therefore CHD1L may become a new independent marker of tumo r 199 progression, prognosis, and survival time. The role of the CHD1L/MDM2/p53 200 pathway loop in cancers has been widely studied. p53 coordinates a transcription 201 program to stall the cell cycle, promote DNA repair, and i nitiate senescence or 202 apoptosis. The primary modulators of p53 the E3 ligase 203 MDM2 which constitutively polyubiquitinate p53 for proteasomal degradation, 204 maintaining p53 at low levels[16]. Our result suggests that down-regulation of CHD1L , 205 MDM2 and up-regulation of p53 might be responsible for the a nti-metastasis 206 mechanisms of hirudin in breast cancer. 207 The zebrafish has become a powerful vertebrate system for modeling human 208 cancers and is an excellent platform to study all stages of metastasis[17]. The 209 transplantation of cancer cells into zebrafish embry os is most frequently used in 210 zebrafish models. Briefly, human cancer cells labeled w ith a fluorescent marker are 211 inoculated into larvae or embryos of zebrafish[18]. Hence, the purpose of the study was 212 to confi rm anti-proliferation and anti-metastasis effect of hirudi n using a zebrafish 213 xenograft model. 214 In conclusion , the present study demonstrated that hirudin may inhibit the 215 viability, migration and invasion of breast adenocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. 216 Furthermore, it was revealed that the inhibitory effect of hirudin was primarily 217 associated with the suppression of CHD1L , MDM2 and an increase in p53 . These 218 results suggested that hirudin may possess great potential fo r the treatment of breast 219 cancer metastasis partially through CHD1L/MDM2/p53 signaling. 220 221 Abbreviations 222 double minute 2; FBS: Fetal bovine serum. 224 225 Ethics approval 226 The study was carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE gui delines.
