As a trusted [chiropractor in Canton, Ohio](https://mycantonchiropractor.com/), we combine our skills in physical therapy and cold laser therapy to treat pain and inflammation, helping you heal without going through invasive procedures. Our practice offers Multi Radiance Super Pulsed Cold Laser Therapy, which has one of the most sophisticated and safest laser classifications in the world. The therapy is non-toxic, poses no contraindications, and is cost-effective and easy to apply. It works by utilizing multiple specific wavelengths, allowing effective tissue penetration at different levels. It is powered by LaserSweep technology, which can change the number of pulses emitted per second as it scans the targeted superficial and deep tissues. This prevents the body from adapting and being resilient to its effects. The generated pulses travel deep into the target tissues, strongly reducing pain and improving micro-circulation in the affected areas of the nueromusculoskeletal system. Moreover, a static magnetic field keeps the tissues' ionized molecules in a dissociated state, increasing the body's energy absorption capabilities.
