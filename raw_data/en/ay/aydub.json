What are the Doshas in ayurveda? Ayurveda works on the principles of the physical constitution, emotional nature and spiritual outlook of the person. According to Ayurveda, the life forces manifest themselves as three forms of energy or doshas - Vatta, Pitta and Kapha. We are all made up of unique combinations of these three doshas which are determined at the time of conception. However, these dosha combinations fluctuate throughout life according to age, diet, season, environment, moods, etc. When there is a fluctuation, it can become a cause for concern or inconvenience. Vatta dosha - Such personalities are physically and mentally active; they enjoy creative endeavours and travelling. Vatta types also tend to eat and sleep erratically, often ingesting stimulants to sustain their intense physical/mental activities. They enjoy warm weather and tend to have issues with cracking joints, dry skin, constipation, etc. Pitta dosha - Pitta types are characterised by the fire element and this makes them innately strong and intense. They tend to be medium-built and well-muscled, immensely competitive and fiery in nature. They suffer from conditions such as inflammations, rashes and loose stools. Kapha dosha - These types are influenced by the earth and water elements and are innately loyal, stable and compassionate. They tend to exercise regularly and appreciate methodology in their personal and professional lives. When imbalanced, they tend to become stubborn and unmotivated.
