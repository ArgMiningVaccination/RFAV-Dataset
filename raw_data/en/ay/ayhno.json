It is one of the oldest health and well-being systems, which evolved on the Indian subcontinent over 5,000 years ago. Unlike the conventional approach, it is more than symptom management in that it addresses the root cause of disease, focusing on breaking the disease process and preventing it in the future by re-establishing equilibrium through dietary and lifestyle modifications alongside herbal and mind-body healing therapies. Mamta started her career in healthcare as a Research Assistant at the Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest. Her natural curiosity about yogic sciences and desire for personal development lead her to train in Hatha and Kundalini yoga and eventually to become an ayurvedic practitioner. Her practice is patient-focus as she listens and personalized each treatment to ensure patients get the care they need. Her goal is to help people achieve optimum well-being through a holistic approach.
