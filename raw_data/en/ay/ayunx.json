From developing strategies to fight the Climate Crisis to fixing our nation's infrastructure to addressing inequity through energy justice, our research has real-world impact across sectors. Learn about the Energy Technologies Area's strategic research initiatives and ten-year milestones. Our Strategic Plan covers ETA's priority research areas: energy storage, resilience, integrated energy systems, the water-energy nexus, and science of manufacturing. Our researchers are organized into three research Divisions, which are dedicated to science and delivering results that are tangible. Our Divisions host expertise and facilities and foster partnership to bring energy solutions to the world. Hydrogen Storage from Material Innovation to Deployment Chemical engineer [Peng Peng](/people/peng-peng) is helping develop a 100% renewable energy grid by investigating new materials for storing hydrogen gas, which can be used like a battery to stash power generated from solar and wind farms. Watch the video on the right to learn how Peng uses computer models to study how lab-scale material prototypes would perform at the industrial scale, and how much they would cost - accelerating the green hydrogen movement from discovery to deployment. The Energy Technologies Area is building on energy efficiency expertise to deliver strategies and technologies that mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis in buildings, manufacturing, transportation and air quality.
