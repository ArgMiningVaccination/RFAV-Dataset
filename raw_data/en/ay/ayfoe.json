Vol. 02-7Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is published once each month by the Department of Administration, Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a compilation of alladministrative rulemaking documents in Idaho. The Bulletin publishes the official text notice and full text of such actions. State agencies are required to provide public notice of rulemaking activity and invite public input. The public receives notice of a rulemaking activity through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and the Legal Notice published monthly in local newspapers. The Legal Notice provides reasonable opportunity for public input, either oral orwritten, which may be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the Legal Notice. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted in regard to the rule. Comment periods are not provided in temporary or final rulemaking activities. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is cited by year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 00-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2000, Bulletin 01-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2001, etc. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; Volume No. 1 refers to January; Volume No. 2 refers to February; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January of 2001 is citedas Volume 01-1, the December 1999 Bulletin is cited as Volume 99-12. The March 2000 Bulletin is cited as Volume 00-3. RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the reader with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rules that have been adopted and approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthlyIdaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are not printed in the Administrative Code and are published only in the Bulletin. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Index of Administrative Rulemaking , printed in each Bulletin. TYPES OF RULEMAKINGS PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The state of Idaho administrative rulemaking process comprises five distinct activities; Negotiated, Proposed, Temporary, Pending, and Final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings consist of all five. At a minimum a rulemakingincludes proposed, pending, and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when meeting required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate concensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begins withproposed rulemaking and ends with final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKINGIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 5 July 3, 2002 - Vol. 02-7Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested parties and the agency seek a consensus on the content of the rule. Agencies are encouraged to proceed through this informal rulemaking whenever it is feasible todo so. Publication of the text in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should lead the rulemaking to the temporary and/or proposed rule stage. PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency in which the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish anotice of proposed rulemaking in the Bulletin. The notice of proposed rulemaking must include: a) the specific statutory authority for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the substance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format; d) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; e) the manner in which persons may make written comments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to whom comments on the proposal may be sent; f) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation; and g) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to the pending rule stage. A proposed rule does not have anassigned effective date unless published in conjunction with a temporary rule docket. An agency may vacate a proposed rulemaking if it decides not to proceed further with the promulgation process. TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) the protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; or c) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets any one or all of the above requirements, a rule may become effective before it has been submitted to the legislature for review and the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular session of the legislature unless the rule is approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution or when the rule has been replaced by a final rule. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is the same as that of the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a temporary/proposed rule. State law requires that the text of a proposed or temporary rule be published in the Administrative Bulletin. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 6 July 3, 2002 - Vol. 02-7An agency may rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect if the rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or has been published concurrently with a proposed rulemaking that is being vacated. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking process and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the Notice of Pending Rule. This includes: a) the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective; and d) an identification of any portion of the rule imposing or increasing a fee or charge. Agencies are required to republish the text of the rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is notalways necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are republished. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the Notice of Pending Rule is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking process and is in effect. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that the agency has violated the legislative intent of the statute under which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution will be adopted rejecting, amending, or modifying the rule orany part thereof. A Notice of Final Rule must be published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made. A rule that has been reviewed by the legislature and has not been rejected, amended, or modified will become final with no further legislative action. Norule shall become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule was submitted for review. However, a rule which is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin are organized by a numbering system. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are\"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections with a number of subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.060.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"IDAPA 38. \" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration. \"05.\" refers to Title 05 which is the Department of Administration 's Division of Purchasing. \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing \". \"060.\" refers to Major Section 060, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid \". \"02.\" refers to Subsection 060. 02. \"c.\" refers to Paragraph 060.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subparagraph 060.02.c. ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 8 July 3, 2002 - Vol. 02-7DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER \". The \"Docket Number \" is a series of numbers separated by a hyphen \"-\", (38-0501-0101). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAPA designation (e.g. the two- digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-0101\" \"38-\" denotes the agency 's IDAPA number; in this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing \" (Chapter 01). \"0101\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket submitted and published during the year; in this case the first rulemaking action of the chapter published in calendar year 2001. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section\"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: \"(BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) \" INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITATIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows : \"...as found in Section 201 of this rule. \" OR \"...in accordance with Subsection 201.06.c. of this rule. \" It may also be cited to include the IDAPA, Title, and Chapter number also, as follows: TITLE number of the agency rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the agency rule. \"201\" references the main Section number of the rule that is being cited. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAPA, Title, and Chapter numbers. The following is a typical example of an external citation to another rule chapter: \"...as outlined in the Rules of the Department of Administration, IDAPA 38.04.04, 'Rules Governing Capitol Mall Parking.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed regular rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section(s) 54-204(1) Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than July 17, 2002. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The rules implement the changes to the way Idaho licenses and regulates CPA based upon HB 485, which was passed during the 2002 Legislative Session. It is a complete rewrite regarding the way CPAs and LPAs are licensed andregulated in the state of Idaho. It reflects a national model on regulatory language. Specifics include: the education and experience requirements to sit for the CPA Exam and to become licensed; the ability for licensees to practice across state lines via a streamlined process; a recognition of foreign credentials; non-licensee ownership of firms; theacceptance of commissions and contingent fees; issuance of inactive and retired status licenses; and allowing licensees to issue plain paper financial statements. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: HB 485 was passed during the 2002 Legislative Session with an effective date of July 1, 2002. Temporary rules are necessary to implement the new facets of the law at the time the law becomes effective. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: The new law creates two new license types, Inactive and Retired. It also implements Substantial Equivalency as a basis for granting practice privileges to licensees from other states. The temporary rules implement the fees for these new license types. Our license year runs from July 1st to June 30th, so the new fees need to be assessed immediately upon the bill 's effective date. Without the ability to assess the fees, the Idaho State Board of Accountancy would not be able to grant the new types of licenses. Inactive and Retired licenses would be $100 per year. Practice Privileges would be $50 per year. The American Institute of CPAs is increasing its Uniform CPA Examination grading fee to $36 per section effective November 2002. Spending authority to cover the increased cost was approved in the FY 2003 budget. The rule change is to cover the fee increase. The Board currently collects $22.50 per section for the exam. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was conducted . The Board of Accountancy held public hearings around the state, conducted surveys of interested parties, and sentmultiple newsletters on the issues.

The action is authorized pursuant to Section(s) 54-204(1) Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than July 17, 2002. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The rules update the fee structure to allow the Board to recover the actual expenses incurred for providing services and administering programs. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: HB 485 was passed in 2002 with an effective date of July 1, 2002. It is a complete rewrite regarding the way CPAs and LPAs are licensed and regulated in the state of Idaho. It reflects a national model on regulatory language. All fees and fines were analyzed in relation to HB 485. Most fees and fines can be maintained at their current level, with the following exceptions. 1) The late license renewal fine has been at $50 since 1993. The late filing fines for continuing education reporting and for firm registration are each $100. This creates an inequity. Additionally, failure to timely renew a license initiates suspension activity. This requires notice and opportunity for hearing. Staff time to do so exceeds the$50 that is collected. The costs are subsidized by licensees who renew timely. This change places the burden on those who are not in compliance. The proposed rule increases the late fee from $50 to $100. 2) Firm Registration fees were set in 1993 under the old rulemaking process, with a 1996 implementation date. Somehow the fee structure that the Board adopted was not incorporated into the rule. The inconsistency was not found until the rule drafting began to go with HB 485. This change brings the firm registration fee into line with thestructure the Board previously developed. The current rule sets the fee at $100 per firm. The proposed rule would charge $25 for a firm with one licensee, and an additional $5 per licensee within the firm up to a maximum of $200 per firm. 3) Two administrative processes that provide services to candidates, applicants or licensees are not generating the revenue to cover their costs. Wall certificates cost about $20 each to generate. Current charge is $10.The proposed rule would increase the fee to $20. Interstate exchange of information forms cost about $10 each to complete. Currently there is no fee. The change allows the Board to recover its actual costs. The proposed rule authorizes a $10 charge to complete the form. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was conducted. The fee structure analysis was undertaken simultaneously with the other rule drafting activity which included input for amultitude of stakeholders.

The action is authorized by Sections 39-105, 39-107, and39-3601 et seq., Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency.Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before July 17, 2002. If no such writtenrequest is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Under Docket No. 58-0107-0201, the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has initiated proposed rulemaking for the adoption of a new rule implementing DEQ 's authority to regulate underground storage tank systems (UST systems). This proposed rule covers design, construction, installation, operation, release detection, closure and financial assurance requirements for UST systems. With some modification,this proposed rule incorporates the technical standards for UST system owners and operators found in 40 CFR Part280. DEQ currently regulates leaking petroleum storage tank systems (PST systems) through the requirements of IDAPA 58.01.02, \"Water Quality Standards and Wastewater Treatment Requirements, \" Sections 851 and 852. Sections 060 and 070 of proposed rule Docket No. 58-0107-0201 contain the language, without modification, currently found in Sections 851 and 852. The purpose of this rulemaking is to repeal Sections 851 and 852, to allow, for ease of use, the requirements for UST systems and leaking PST systems to be located in the same rules. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in October 2002 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2003 session of the Idaho Legislature. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Due to the nature of this rulemaking, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted. ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on questions concerning the proposed rulemaking, contact Rick Jarvis at (208)373-0502 or rjarvis@deq.state.id.us.

The action is authorized by Chapters 1 and 36, T itle 39, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this proposed rulemaking will be held as follows: July 18, 2002, 7 p.m. Department of Environmental Quality Conference Center1410 N.

For arrangements, contact the undersigned at (208)373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: DEQ is evaluating the various conditions and circumstances that are used for making determinations of when public or central wastewater treatment facilities are reasonably accessible to undeveloped property. DEQ conducts reviews of proposed subdivisions at the request of city and county governmental agencies. The purpose of this rulemaking is to provide greater detail to DEQ and the health districts in making decisions as to when central wastewater treatment facilities are reasonably accessible for new development and for issuing subsurface sewage disposal permits. The rule is needed to protect public health from ground water degradation due tonitrate contributions from septic systems in areas where subdivisions may be better served by central wastewater facilities. The rule establishes the conditions in which septic systems are an acceptable alternative to central wastewater treatment facilities. The rule revises the estimate of wastewater flow from single family dwellings. The current rule uses the number of bedrooms in a single-family dwelling to estimate wastewater flow and starts with a base amount of 250 gallons perday for a three-bedroom home. The base amount is below the national average and under estimates the wastewater flow from single-family dwellings. The revised rule eliminates this problem by estimating wastewater flow by using a per capita wastewater generation rate and setting the number of persons per bedroom at 1.5. The estimated flowfrom large single-family dwellings is modified by a margin of safety based on dwelling square footage. This rule will also revise the list of systems installed by complex septic system installers; delete the exemption from licensure requirement for public works contractors and specify that general contractors do not qualify for the exemption; revisethe separation distance to surface waters by adding additional categories for watertight pipe (irrigation) and tiled ditches; and adopts additional siting criteria. The rule allows local jurisdictions to adopt rules, standards, or ordinances that are more stringent than these rules. The rule title is changed from Individual/Subsurface Sewage Disposal Rules to Individual/Subsurface Sewage Treatment and Distribution Rules. The rule also sets down the procedures to revoke permits and to issue failingpermits. This proposed rule is an amendment to longstanding administrative rules which regulate activities that are not regulated by the federal government. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the proposed rule has been drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during a negotiation conducted pursuant to Idaho Code Section 67-5220 and IDAPA 04.11.01.812 -815. The negotiation was open to the public. Participants in the negotiation included Central District Health and Southwest District Health, Boise City, Garden City, members of the public, and DEQ staff. The Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Volume 02-2, February 6, 2002, page 37.

The action is authorized by Sections 39-105 and 39-107, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency.Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before July 17, 2002. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This proposed rule implements Department of Environmental Quality 's (DEQ) authority to regulate underground storage tank systems (UST systems). This proposed rule covers design, construction, installation, operation, release detection, closure and financial assurance requirements for UST systems.With some modification, this proposed rule incorporates the technical standards for UST system owners and operators found in 40 CFR Part 280. DEQ currently regulates leaking petroleum storage tank systems (PST systems) through the requirements of IDAPA 58.01.02, \"Water Quality Standards and Wastewater Treatment Requirements, \" Sections 851 and 852. Sections 060 and 070 of this proposed rule contain the language, without modification, currently found in Sections 851 and 852.Concurrent with adoption of this rule, DEQ will repeal Sections 851 and 852, to allow, for ease of use, the requirements for UST systems and leaking PST systems to be located in the same rules. The Department provides notice that the language in Sections 006, 012, 013, 021, 022, 023, 026, 028, 050, 051, 052, 082 and 084 of the proposed rules differ from the language in comparable federal regulations located in 40 CFR Part 280 and, therefore, may be interpreted as broader in scope or more stringent than the comparable federal regulation. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in October 2002 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon theconclusion of the 2003 session of the Idaho Legislature. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the rule has been drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during an informal negotiation. An advisory committee made up of industry representatives participated in the negotiations. GENERAL INFORMATION: For more information about DEQ 's programs and activities, visit DEQ 's web site at www.state.id.us/deq. ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on questions concerning the proposed rulemaking, contact Rick Jarvis at (208)373-0502 or rjarvis@deq.state.id.us. Anyone can submit written comments by mail, fax or e-mail at the address below regarding this proposed rule.

Operation And Maintenance . When an UST system is temporarily closed, owners and operators must continue operation and maintenance of corrosion protection in accordance with Section 023 of this rule, and any release detection in accordance with Sections 027 through 052 of this rule. Sections 060 and 070 must be compliedwith if a release from a PST system is suspected or confirmed. However, release detection is not required as long as the UST system is empty. The UST system is empty when all materials have been removed using commonly employed practices so that no more than two point five (2.5) centimeters (one (1) inch) of residue, or three tenthspercent (0.3%) by weight of the total capacity of the UST system, remain in the system. ( ) 02. Temporary Closure . When an UST system is temporarily closed for three (3) months or more, owners and operators must also comply with the following requirements: ( ) a.Leave vent lines open and functioning; and ( )DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0107-0201 Underground Storage & Leaking Petroleum Storage Tanks Proposed Rulemaking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 304 July 3, 2002 - Vol. 02-7b.Cap and secure all other lines, pumps, manways, and ancillary equipment. ( ) 03. Permanent Closure . When an UST system is temporarily closed for more than twelve (12) months, owners and operators must permanently close the UST system if it does not meet either performance standards in Section 013 of this rule for new UST systems or the upgrading requirements in Section 020 of this rule,except that the spill and overfill equipment requirements do not have to be met. Owners and operators must permanently close the substandard UST systems at the end of this twelve (12) month period in accordance with Sections 081 through 084 of this rule, unless the Department provides an extension of the twelve (12) monthtemporary closure period. Owners and operators must complete a site assessment in accordance with Section 082 of this rule before such an extension can be applied for. ( ) 081. PERMANENT CLOSURE AND CHANGES-IN-SERVICE. 01. Notification . At least thirty (30) days before beginning either permanent closure or a change-in- service under Subsections 081.02 and 081.03 or within another reasonable time period determined by the Department, owners and operators must notify the Department of their intent to permanently close or make the change-in-service, unless such action is in response to corrective action. The required assessment of the excavationzone under Section 082 of this rule must be performed after notifying the Department but before completion of the permanent closure or a change-in-service. ( ) 02. Permanent Closure . To permanently close a tank, owners and operators must empty and clean it by removing all liquids and accumulated sludges. All tanks taken out of service permanently must also be either removed from the ground or filled with an inert solid material. Subsection 085.14 may be used to comply withSubsection 081.02. ( ) 03. Change In Service . Continued use of an UST system to store a non-regulated substance is considered a change-in-service. Before a change-in-service, owners and operators must empty and clean the tank by removing all liquid and accumulated sludge and conduct a site assessment in accordance with Section 082 of this rule. Subsection 085.14 may be used to comply with Subsection 081.03. ( ) 082. ASSESSING THE SITE AT CLOSURE OR CHANGE-IN-SERVICE. 01. Site Assessment . Before permanent closure or a change-in-service is completed, owners and operators must measure for the presence of a release where contamination is most likely to be present at the UST site. In selecting sample types, sample locations, and measurement methods, owners and operators must consider themethod of closure, the nature of the stored substance, the type of backfill, the depth to ground water, and other factors appropriate for identifying the presence of a release. Owners and operators must submit to the Department the results of the site assessment conducted pursuant to Subsection 082.01 within thirty (30) days of completion of UST closure. ( ) 02. Corrective Action . If, with resect to PST systems, contaminated soils, contaminated ground water, or free product is discovered under Subsection 082.01, or by any other manner, owners and operators must begin corrective action in accordance with Section 070 of this rule. ( ) 083. APPLICABILITY TO PREVIOUSLY CLOSED UST SYSTEMS. When directed by the Department, the owner and operator of an UST system permanently closed before December 22, 1988 must assess the excavation zone and close the UST system in accordance with Sections 080 through 084 ifreleases from the UST may, in the judgment of the Department, pose a current or potential threat to human health and the environment. ( ) 084. CLOSURE RECORDS. 01. Record Maintenance . Owners and operators must maintain records in accordance with Section 026 of this rule that are capable of demonstrating compliance with closure requirements under this Rule. For UST systems closed before the effective date of this rule, the results of the excavation zone assessment required in Section 082 of this rule must be maintained for at least three (3) years after completion of permanent closure or change-in-service. For UST systems closed on or after the effective date of this rule, the results of the excavation zoneDEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0107-0201 Underground Storage & Leaking Petroleum Storage Tanks Proposed Rulemaking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Page 305 July 3, 2002 - Vol. 02-7assessment required in Section 082 of this rule must be maintained for at least ten (10) years after completion of permanent closure or change-in-service.

The action is authorized by Chapter 1, Title 39, Idaho Code and Chapter 21, Title 37, IdahoCode. In addition, states which have primary enforcement responsibility for the Safe Drinking Water Act are required by 40 CFR 142.10(a) and 40 CFR 142.12(b) through (d) to adopt within two years of promulgation, national primary drinking water regulations that are no less stringent than the federal regulations in effect under 40 CFR Part 141. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this proposed rulemaking will be held as follows: July 18, 2002, 7 p.m. Department of Environmental Quality Conference Center 1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Idaho. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made no later than five (5) days prior to the hearing. For arrangements, contact the undersigned at (208)373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Engineering standards dealing with design, construction, and operation of public water systems have not been systematically revisited since the mid-1980 's. Advancing technologies and new national regulations have combined to make some portions of the rules increasingly dated and, in some instances, overly restrictive. This rulemaking is to update obsolete provisions, add flexibility where possible and appropriate, and clarify certain language that has presented interpretive difficulties in the past. Additionally, a number of housekeeping changes are included in this rulemaking as a matter of convenience. These changes address spelling, punctuation, and syntax problems throughout the rules. Addresses and phone numbers oforganizations referenced in the rules have been changed where necessary. In addition, provision is made for temporarily waiving continuing education requirements for certified operators who are called to active military service and are unable to comply. The engineering standards apply to newly designed public water systems and to significant modifications proposed for existing public water systems. As such they affect consulting engineers, developers of new systems, and ownersof new and existing systems. The housekeeping changes included in this rulemaking are for the benefit of all users of the rules and also serve to meet standards established by the Legislature and the Department of Administration. The engineering standards for design, construction, and operation of public water systems regulate activities that are not regulated by the federal government. These standards were promulgated to fulfill the requirements Section 39- 118, Idaho Code and pre-date the Safe Drinking Water Act. This rulemaking proposes only to update and clarify long-standing administrative rules. The changes made in this rulemaking are no more stringent than the applicable federal regulations. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2002 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule isexpected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2003 session of the Idaho Legislature. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the rule has been drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during a negotiation conducted pursuant to Section 67-5220, Idaho Code, and IDAPA 58.01.23.812 - 815. The negotiation was open to the public. Participants in the negotiation included representatives from regulated public water systems, Idaho Rural Water Association, the American Water Works Association, private engineering firms,and professional geologists. The Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Volume 01-12, December 5, 2001, page 114.

The action is authorized by Chapter 1, Title 39, Idaho Code and Chapter 21, Title 37, IdahoCode. In addition, states which have primary enforcement responsibility for the Safe Drinking Water Act are required by 40 CFR 142.10(a) and 40 CFR 142.12(b) through (d) to adopt within two years of promulgation, national primary drinking water regulations that are no less stringent than the federal regulations in effect under 40 CFR Part 141. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency.Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before July 17, 2002. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promulgated the Filter Backwash Recycling Rule and the Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule on June 8, 2001 and January 14, 2002. These are national primary drinking water regulations. As a State that has primacy for administering the SafeDrinking Water Act, Idaho must adopt these rules within two years of promulgation. Filter Backwash Recycling Rule: Requires public water systems that use surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water to notify the State if they recycle and waste fluids from their treatment process. Systems must provide the State with a description of their recycling practices and identify the point at which these recycled streams enter the treatment train. Systems may be required to modify recycling practices if it isdemonstrated that these practices adversely affect the ability of the system to meet surface water treatment requirements. Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule: Requires public water systems that use surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water and serve less than 10,000 persons to meet tighter standards for turbidity, to monitor individual filter bed turbidity continuously, and to undertake corrective actions if turbidityexcursions occur. Systems must prepare a disinfection profile of their treatment plant unless they can demonstrate to the State that they have disinfection by-product levels that are less than 80% of the maximum contaminant levels set forth in the Stage 1 Disinfection By-products Rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should beaddressed. After consideration of public comments, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2002 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2003 session of the Idaho Legislature. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Due to the nature of this rulemaking, negotiations were not held. GENERAL INFORMATION: For more information about DEQ 's programs and activities, visit DEQ 's web site at www.state.id.us/deq.

At least once per day, the system shall monitor the following parameters to determine the total inactivation ratio achieved through disinfection: (12-10-92) (1) Temperature of the disinfected water at each residual disinfectant concentration sampling point; and (12-10-92) (2) If using chlorine, the pH of the disinfected water at each chlorine residual sampling point. (12-10-92) (3) The disinfectant contact time, \"T,\" must be determined each day during peak hourly flow. Disinfectant contact time, \"T,\" in pipelines used for Giardia lamblia and virus inactivation shall be calculated by dividing the internal volume of the pipe by the peak hourly flow rate through that pipe. Disinfectant contact time, \"T,\" for all other system components used for Giardia lamblia and virus inactivation shall be determined by tracer studiesor equivalent methods. (12-10-92) (4) The residual disinfectant concentrations at each residual disinfectant sampling point at or before the first customer, must be determined each day during peak hourly flow, or at other times approved by the Department. (12-10-92) iii. The purveyor may demonstrate to the Department, based on a Department approved on-site disinfection challenge study protocol, that the system is achieving disinfection requirements specified in Subsection 300.03 utilizing CT99.9 values other than those specified in 40 CFR 141.74(b)(3) (Tables 2.1 and 3.1) for ozone,chlorine dioxide, and chloramine. (10-1-93) iv. The total inactivation ratio shall be calculated as follows: (12-10-92)(1) If the system applies disinfectant at only one (1) point, the system shall determine the total inactivation ratio by either of the two (2) following methods: (12-10-92) (a) One inactivation ratio (CTcalc/CT99.9) is determined at/or before the first customer during peak hourly flow; or (12-10-92) (b) Sequential inactivation ratios are calculated between the point of disinfectant application and a point at or before the first customer during peak hourly flow. The following method must be used to calculate the totalinactivation ratio: (12-10-92) (i) Step 1: Determine (CTcalc/CT99.9) for each sequence. (12-10-92)(ii) Step 2: Add the (CTcalc/CT99.9) values for all sequences. The result is the total inactivation ratio. (12-10-92) (2) If the system uses more than one point of disinfectant application at or before the first customer, the system must determine the CT value of each disinfection sequence immediately prior to the next point of disinfectantapplication during peak hourly flow. The sum of the (CTcalc/CT99.9) values from all sequences is the total inactivation ratio. (CTcalc/CT99.9) must be determined by the methods described in 40 CFR 141.74(b)(4)(i)(B). (12-10-92) v. Log removal credit for disinfection shall be determined by multiplying the total inactivation ratio by three (3).
