Welcome to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center's Together We STRIDE Project. STRIDE is an acronym for Strategizing Together Relevant Interventions for Diet and Exercise. STRIDE is an academic -community partnership project, that is, the community mem bers in the Lower Yakima Valley gave input throughout the project to make it relevant to the community. The community members who are part of our community advisory board (CAB) represent schools, outreach programs, and agencies including social services, c linics, and community advocates. History of Together We STRIDE (Juntos, Pasos Adelante) In 2011, we met with the CAB to ask them about health concerns of the community, and the group collectively said childhood obesity . In January of 2013, we received a g rant from the National Institutes of Health to build a youth obesity prevention program in the Yakima Valley. Together with our CAB and the Center for Community Health Promotion in Sunnyside (WA), we created and launched nutrition and physical activity (PA) programs in the Yakima Valley on a smaller scale. Where We Are Today A second grant from the National Institutes of Health has enabled us to scale up the nutrition and PA programs for children, their families, and the community. We met with the district superintendents and principals who have been very supportive of the work. We implemented several programs in the community, including at schools. We now plan to disseminate our program across the communities in the Yakima Valley. Your Role and the Handbo ok As a community Health Worker, or Health Educator, you have an opportunity to impact families to eat healthier and be more physically active. The eight nutrition and PA m odules are developed to be fun, focus on learning, and promote PA through guided group exercise. The purpose of this handbook is to serve as a \"how -to\" manual for motivating families to eat healthy and be physically active. Each class session is structured to include: 1) an ice breaker, 2) nutrition or PA education, 3) a cooking demonstration, 4) a guided group exercise, and 5) goal setting. The handbook includes curriculum for eight class sessions, take -home materials, and resources on how to conduct the activities with families in your community. Sincerely, Together We STRID E Team Together We STRIDE The goal of Together We STRIDE is to implement a community -wide program to improve nutrition and PA among children, their families, and their community. The program was developed based on findings from many scientific studies which showed that children are able to adopt healthier behaviors if programs are implemented not only at the individual level but also at other influential levels of society, such as families, organizations, and the community as a whole. This way of thinking is called a socio -ecological model, which is illustrated in the picture on the right. To impact the nutrition and PA of the gir l in the far-left (circled in yellow), programs and policies need to be aimed at her, her family, friends, school, church, the local community, and nationally. Together We STRIDE was created following this model, and the program consists of 4 different components aimed at children, their families, their schools, and their local community. Together We STRIDE programs: Educational comic books for children Nutrition and PA classes for families School classroom activities Annual community -wide nutrition and PA event Farmer's market support Family Classes Family -based nutrition and PA classes can be a great way to help families work together to learn about healthy eating and PA. The classes can take several forms, such as a series of multi - generational nutrition and PA classes for children, parents, and grandparents to build knowledge about healthy eating and PA, improve skills for healthy cooking and staying physically active, and learn goal setting skills. The Together We STRIDE program developed an 8 -week nutrition and PA curriculum in English and Spanish. Each class was two hours long: 10 minutes for participant arrival and light snack, 30 -minute didactic seminar, 30-minute cooking demonstration & tasting, 40 -minute grou p PA, and 10 -minute wrap -up and take -home material distribution. At the end of each session, families set weekly goals and received a give - away item based on the theme of the class (e.g., measuring cups, water bottle, jump rope). Of the 8 -week sessions, three of the sessions included \"food baskets\" for families to take home. These food baskets contained all the ingredients necessary for the family to replicate the meal demonstrated in class at home. Class modules included: 1. Discussion about family values and health - Our Values 2. Physical activity benefits, guidelines and examples - Physical Activity is Key to Living Well 3. Benefits of eating fruits and vegetables - Catch a Rainbow 4. Discussion about My Plate I - My Plate Part I 5. Discussion about My Plate II - My Plate Part II 6. Choosing between organic vs. conventional food products - To Be or Not To Be Organic 7. Gardening - Kitchen Gardens 8. Shopping healthy foods products on a budget - Eating Healthy on a Budget How to Use This Handbook In this handbook you will find comprehensive lesson plans to implement nutrition and PA family classes similar to what was done in the Together We STRIDE project. The structure of the Together We STRIDE family classes is provided a s a guide and can be adapted for your specific program. Module Structure There are eight modules. Each module contains a lesson on a PA or nutrition topic. The PowerPoint presentations for each module will help guide you through each lesson and their activ ities. Below is a list of the components associated with each module. Ice breaker: Following an introduction to each topic, ice breakers can help the group get comfortable sharing and talking with each other. My Family Can: At the end of each lesson, families will be encouraged to set goals for the week using the My Family Can sheets to track weekly progress. There are two versions of My Family Can sheets (nutrition and PA), which should correspond with the main topic of the lesson (e.g., use PA sheet for Module 2 Physical Activity is Key to Living Well). Completed sheets should be brought back each week to demonstrate family progress and can even serve as record for earning incentives/prizes for meeting set goals. Tip sheets/handouts: Most lessons also include tip sheets/handouts so that families have a reference for the information learned to then practice at home. Cooking demonstration: The cooking demonstration is intended to engage families in healthy cooking, u sing the week's recipe as an example. We recommend sending families home with food baskets some weeks to help incentivize trying new recipes together and to build their confidence in cooking healthy at home. Group -based PA : The group -based PA is how we lik e to end each class. Not only does the PA component allow families to experience being active together, but also helps show them that it doesn't take much to be physically active at home. GoNoodle and YouTube are great places to find short PA videos for all ages. Preparing for Lessons We recommend doing a \"dry run\" of each lesson before implementing the lessons with families or other groups. Print out a copy of the PowerPoint to take notes on. Getting to know the lessons in and out will help you gain confidence in your understanding of the material and your ability to answer questions as they come up in the lesso ns. It helps to organize the lessons by module (including all relevant materials) so that everything is kept together. For example, we kept a box with a file for each module, including copies of all handouts needed for that lesson. And don't forget the foo d for the cooking demonstration! We recommend cooking enough food during the demo for everyone to try. We believe seeing the meals prepared in front of the group (the smells, the sounds, the colors) adds to the experience and excitement of eating healthy! Implementation Now that you know the overall structure of the modules, you are ready to use this handbook! Here you will find all that you need to get started. Once again, these modules and materials are meant as a guide. It is up to you to make it your own, adapting to the needs and culture of your community to make it more impactful and meaningful. If you have any questions about the handbook or the materials provided, please feel free to contact Emily Brown at evbrown@fredhutch.org .

THEN, ASK THEM TO SHARE WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO STAY ACTIVE INDIVIDUALLY AND AS A FAMILY TOGETHER. \"Now I'm going to ask everyone to share with the class what their family is eating at home for breakfast, lunch, di nner, and snacks. For example, my family commonly eats fried eggs and cereal for breakfast. For staying active, my family goes to the school playground once a week.\" 3. WRITE DOWN THE PARTICIPANTS' RESPONSE ON THE BOARD. AFTER ALL THE PARTICIPANTS HAVE FINIS HED GIVING THEIR RESPONSE, GIVE THEM FEEDBACK BASED ON THE CURRENT RECOMMENDATION FOR MY PLATE [SEE RESOURCES FOR CURRENT RECOMMENDATION) AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (30 MINUTES MODERATE -VIGOROUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DAILY FOR ADULTS AND 60 MINUTES OF VIGOROUS PHYS ICAL ACTIVITY DAILY FOR CHILDREN). EXAMPLE ON HEALTHY EATING: IF A PARTICIPANT SAYS THAT THEY HAD FRIED EGG AND TOAST FOR BREAKFAST, A BEEF BURRITO WITH MEAT AND GRAINS FOR LUNCH, AND SPAGHETTI WITH SALAD FOR DINNER. TELL THEM THAT THEY NEED TO THINK ABOU T MAKING HALF OF THEIR PLATE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND THAT THEY MAY CONSIDER ADDING SOME FRUITS FOR BREAKFAST AND SOME VEGGIES OR SALAD FOR LUNCH. EXAMPLE ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: TELL THEM THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST 10 MINUTES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SEV ERAL TIMES DURING THE DAY FOR HEALTH BENEFITS. SO AN ADULT COULD WALK BRISKLY FOR 10 MINUTES THREE TIMES A DAY. A CHILD COULD RUN FOR 10 MINUTES SIX TIMES A DAY.

This is an easy recipe that you all probably know how to cook. Today, I will make some simple changes. I will use whole grain tortillas instead of flour tor tilla and use low -fat cheese. At the end of the session, we will all get to try it. Before we get started, does anyone have a food allergy we should know about?\" [PRINT THE RECIPE FROM RESOURCES AND GIVE A COPY TO THE PARTICIPANTS AT THE END OF THE CLASS]. \"Now, let's go back and grab onto those awesome values we learned earlier and let's get ready to have some fun moving together to this music.\" PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: 30 MINUTES We are gradually building up to moderate to vigorous level of physical activi ty. So remember to keep at a pace that is best for you, for those of you who are not that active start at a low to moderate level of activity and those of you who are active start at a moderate level of activity . 5 minutes - warm up Let's begin by slowly building up our pace until we are at our exercise pace [ALLOW 5 MINUTES FOR WARM UP ] Healthy Community - Module 1 Page 8 of 12 20 minutes - Physical Activity - Group Aerobics 5 minutes - cool down Hew , that was a nice workout wasn't it. Now let's take 5 minutes to cool down and begin to slow down our pace until we are walking in place. [ALLOW 5 MINUTES TO COOL DOWN] . WHILE DOING COOL DOWN SAY: \"Now, as we are cooling down I will take a few minutes to talk about something th at you may have experienced before or you might experience in the next few days; that is delayed muscle soreness . Some of you may feel your muscles being sore in the next day or two. And that is normal . Muscle soreness often occurs 24 -72 hours after exerci se. Part of the reason is because our body is in the \"repair\" mode. Some of the activities that can cause delayed muscle soreness are the ones that apply force to the muscle. For example, walking down hills, jogging, step aerobics, strength training such a s weight lifting. This usually happens when our body is not used to a type of activity. The best way to prevent muscle soreness is to start slow with the physical activity and progress slowly over time. Also, to reduce pain, we can try ice packs, massage, and over the counter pain relief such as ibuprofen. It's unlikely that we will avoid muscle soreness when starting new exercise program, but it's important to remember that we will avoid muscle soreness when starting new exercise program, but it's important to remember that if you experience pain while during the exercise/activity, then you need to stop the exercise. PLEASE REMEMBER TO ENGAGE EVERYONE AND ENCOURAGE THE SHY ONES TO BE ACTIVE AND JOIN THE FUN. ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO MOVE AT THEIR PACE. IF A PARTICIPANT NEEDS TO TAKE A BREAK, IT'S OK TO DO SO, BUT ENCOURAGE THEM TO STAY MOVING AND JOIN BACK IN WHEN ABLE. IF THEY NEED WATER, THEY CAN TAKE STOP AND TAKE A SIP. \"Hew , that was a nice workout wasn't it.

Healthy Community - Module 2 Page 6 of 14 [PROVIDE EXAMPLES IF NEE DED SO THAT ALL ANSWERS LISTED ABOVE ARE ON CHART] 2. WRITE WHAT KIND AND HOW MUCH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DO I NEED? FLIP CHART \"Engaging in physical activity is easier than we all think. How many times a week do you think we should be physically active? [WRITE THE RESPONSE ON THE FLIP CHART]. These are all great answers. Before we get into specifics of what the healthy guidelines are for physical activity, it's important to have an understanding of some of the terms used to talk about physical activity. First is moderate versus vigorous activity level. What do you think is the difference between the two? [GIVE A FEW SECONDS FOR PAR TICIPANTS TO RESPOND] For moderate level activity the heart will beat faster than normal and breathing will be harder than normal. When you do moderate activities, you can talk while you do them, but you can't sing. So an example of a moderate activity would be a brisk walk. For vigorous level activity the heart will beat much faster than nor mal and breathing will be much harder than normal. When you do vigorous activities, you can only say a few words without stopping to catch a breath. An example of a vigorous activity would be running. We've created a simple handout as a reminder of differe nt types of moderate and vigorous activity. Our goal over this project is to help you understand the importance of movement and activity. Perhaps there are things on this list you do already. [REVIEW HANDOUT WITH GROUP] Now we've covered briefly moderate a nd vigorous activity, it's also important to know the difference between aerobic activity and strength training. Aerobic activity sometimes called \"cardio\" activity gets your heart pumping blood to deliver oxygen to your working muscles. Examples of aerob ic activity could be walking, dancing, swimming, bicycling, running and any activity that gets your heart pumping. Strength training is using resistance to induce muscle contraction which builds strength. Strength training is especially important because i t protects bone health and muscle mass. So let's go back to our initial question - How much Physical Activity Do I need? [REFER BACK TO FLIP CHART] The amount of physically activity is slightly different for adults than for children or youth. Let's take a few minutes to learn about physical activity in a little more depth.\" For adults Healthy Community - Module 2 Page 7 of 14 If you are choosing an activity at a moderate level , you should be active for a minimum of 30 minutes for at least 5 days per week. The goal should be 2 hours and 30 minutes per week. The activities should be performed at least 10 minutes at a time, and preferably, it should be spread throughout the week. If you are choosing an activity at a vigorous level , you should be active for at least 25 minutes 3 days a week for a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Like moderate activity, the activities should be performed in periods of at least 10 minutes, and preferably, should be spread throughout the week. For children/youth: \"Children and youth should strive for 60 minutes (1 hour) or more of physical activity daily. You can break up the activity into periods of at least 10 minutes if 60 minutes seems li ke a lot.\" \"Most of the 60 or more minutes a day should be either moderate - or vigorous -intensity aerobic physical activity. Children and adolescents should include vigorous -intensity physical activity at least 3 days a week.\" \"As part of the 60 or more minutes of daily physical activity , muscle -strengthening physical activity should be at least 3 days of the week. Examples are : Modified push -ups, sit-ups and rope or tree climbing.\" HEALTH PROMOTOR INFORMATION [DEFINITIONS] Muscle -strengthening activity (also known as strength training, resistance training, or muscular strength and endurance exercises). Physical activity that increases skeletal muscle strength, power, endurance, and mass. \"As part of their 60 or more minutes of daily physical activity, children and adolescents should include bone -strengthening physical activity on at least 3 days of the week. Examples are: Running, jumping rope, hopping, skipping, gymnastics.\" HEALTH PROMOTOR INFORMATION [DEFINITIONS] Bone -strengthening activity. Physical activity is primarily designed to increase the strength of specific sites in bones that make up the skeletal system. Bone strengthening activities produce an impact or tension force on the bones that promotes bone gro wth and strength. Healthy Community - Module 2 Page 8 of 14 \"Now that you know this, for adults we need to think about doing at least 30 minutes of moderate activity at least 5 days a week or 25 minutes of vigorous activity at least 3 days a week. And for youth/children you need to think about doing at least 1 hour every day. You don't have to do it all at once, you can do at least 10 minutes of physical activity at a time and add it up over the day.

Pedometers count the steps we walked and you will be able to see how many steps you walked each day. Pedometers don't count movement from bicycling, rowing, or upper body exercises. Wearing a pedometer is a good way to see how active or sedentary you are during the day. In order to get an ac curate count of your steps, attach the pedometer to a firm waistband or belt. For most healthy adults 10,000 steps is a reasonable goal and for kids 16,000 steps a day is a good goal. You can see how active you are for a week by wearing the pedometer and k eeping track of your step. Once you know your usual level of activity then you can set a goal to help you build toward either 10,000 steps for adults or 16,000 steps for kids.

EATING FR UITS AND VEGETABLES ARE GOOD FOR MY FAMILY Topic 15 minutes Healthy Community - Module 3 Page 5 of 13 Purpose The participants will learn about the nutritional value of eating a wide range of colorful fruits and vegetables. Resources Title board \"EATING THE RAINBOW\" poster Variety of Fruits and Vegetables to illustrate the 5 color groups Instructions 1. WRITE \"PUTTING DIVERSITY OF COLORS ON YOUR PLATE\"ON BOARD. 2. USE THE \"EATING THE RAINBOW\" POSTER TO EXPLAIN AND GIVE EXAMPLES OF THE BENEFITS OF COLORFUL FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. BEGIN BY ASKING THE PARTICIPANTS WHY THEY THINK COLORFUL FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE BENEFICIAL TO OUR HEALTH: \"Can someone tell me why it's important to eat colorful fruits and vegetables?\" 3. WRITE DOWN THE PARTIC IPANTS' RESPONSES, ACKNOWLEDGE THEM AND CONTINUE: \"Eating a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables has many nutritional and beneficial values in our bodies. Often the different colors and textures correspond with certain vitamins and minerals. For exam ple, many fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants. These are natural chemicals that are beneficial because they destroy free -radicals which occur naturally but can easily damage our cells when present in large quantities. We know that the deeper the color of a fruit or vegetable, the greater the number of antioxidants they have and thus, the greater the protection they provide. Another important characteristic of fruits and vegetables is that they contain phytochemicals that protect us from illnesses. Ea ting a variety of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis will help us prevent chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer and strengthen our mental capacity and our immune system. In addition to the antioxidants and phytochemicals that fruits and vegeta bles offer, they are also a great source of fiber and are great low -fat foods that can complement a healthy plate. Eating these colorful fruits and vegetables will decrease our risk of high blood pressure, lung diseases, stroke, cataracts, constipation, ur inary tract infection, diabetes, and obesity.\" Healthy Community - Module 3 Page 6 of 13 [CAUTION ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS : Some people assume that because phytochemical supplements come from \"natural\" sources, they must be safe and free from side effects, but this is not always true. Check with your doctor and pharmacists before consuming any phytochemical] . \"So we have now learned that incorporating a variety of fruits and vegetables in our meals is important, we are going to ensure that we get ma ny of the vitamins and minerals that are required for our bodies to function properly. Vitamins are needed to release the energy from the foods we ingest and also to regulate the billions of chemical processes that continuously occur in our bodies. The vi tamins are divided in two groups. The first group is water -soluble vitamins group. These vitamins are not stored in our body and thus must be consumed every day. Examples of water -soluble vitamins are the vitamin B complex that helps build red blood cells and proteins, and vitamin C that is an antioxidant and also helps increase absorption of minerals like iron. The second group, are the fat -soluble vitamins that are normally stored in our liver and fat cells, and therefore we need just small amounts of them from our diet. The fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E & K; they are needed to keep our teeth and tissues strong, and to mainta in proper blood clotting in of our blood. Of note, vitamin D is mainly found in fortified dairy products, eggs and fish with a small amount also found in mushrooms. It is really important for those of us that live in less sunny areas (like Seattle) to get enough dietary vitamin D in the winter because we are not able to make it in our skin, which is how we synthesize vitamin D. Minerals are also very important in our diets for maintenance and regulation of all processes. For example, calcium helps keep our bones and teeth strong and healthy; this mineral is important as we age because our bones become fragile and have the tendency to easily break, especially in women. Another important mineral is iron, which is found in meat, but there is another form found in some green vegetables. In order to increase the absorption of the iron in vegetables, you can pair them with citrus fruits. With adequate intake of iron, we keep our blood strong, which provides us with more energy.\" 4. USE THE \"EATING THE RAINBOW\" POSTER AND POINT OUT AND EXPLAIN TO THE PARTICIPANTS THE 5 MAJOR FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COLOR GROUPS THAT SHOULD BE Healthy Community - Module 3 Page 7 of 13 INCLUDED FOR A HEALTHY DIET. ALSO USE REAL FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AS A DEMO FOR THIS DISCUSSION. \"As you can see in the Eating the Rainbow poster, 5 different colors stand out. The reason for this is that each of these colors represents a group of fruits and vegetables that have a unique set of beneficial properties. What is useful about this image is that we don't have to know what is beneficial about each fruit or vegetable, all we need to remember is what is beneficial about the color group and then select our fruits and vegetables based on their color . So let's look at each of the col or groups. The first is red. The red pigment in fruits such as these cranberries or vegetables such as this beet , they contain beta -carotene, an important antioxidant that is good for your eyes and also to reduce the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disea se. Cranberries like these are great to avoid urinary tract infections. Another important fruit in the red category is the tomato . The pigment in this tomato contains lycopene, which helps protect against certain cancer such as prostate. The next color ca tegory is the orange/yellow group. The pigments in fruits like this orange yellow squash or carrot contain carotenoids that help protect our skin, mucous membranes, eyesight, and our immune system. They also contain powerful antioxidants that protect our cells from free -radical attack. Next is the green category. The chlorophyll in green fruits and vegetables such as this chayote squash , avocado or lime help lower the risk of some cancers, reduce risk of heart disease, keep a healthy vision, and keep our red blood cells healthy. The next color category is made up of blue , purple and black fruits and vegetables. These also provide antioxidants that help lower the risk of some cancers, promote healthy aging, and help maintain a healthy urinary tract. They also improve our memory function and heart health. Blueberries such as these have the hi ghest antioxidant activity of any other fruit. The last color group included is white , tan or brown fruits and vegetables. These may not be as bright or colorful as the other ones we discussed but nonetheless, they contain important minerals such as potas sium and vitamin C to help us keep a healthy heart and immune systems. Examples are bananas , dates , pinto beans , and white corn like these.\" 5. REMIND THE PARTICIPANTS THE IMPORTANCE OF INCORPORATING COLORFUL FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SERVINGS IN THEIR DIET. MENTI ON THAT HALF OF THE PLATE OF A Healthy Community - Module 3 Page 8 of 13 MEAL WHETHER IS BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER, AND SNACK NEED TO BE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. \"As you saw from the great variety of colorful fruits and vegetables, we can include man y of them in traditional cultural dishes. Also because of such variety, it's fun to include different types in different tasty dishes. Finally, because there are many different types, we can include them at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even for snacks.\" 4.

PORTION CONTROL Feedback 5 minutes Purpose The participants will learn about the difference between serving size and a portion and understand what a healthy portion size is. Resources Title board \"Portion Distortion\" poster Measuring cup Slice of bread (wheat) 2 Pair (4) of dice One (1) racquetball One (1) deck of cards Instructions 1. WRITE \"PORTION CONTROL\" ON BOARD. 2. BEGIN BY EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SERVING SIZE AND A PORTION AND HOW WE SHOULD AIM TO MAKE OUR FOOD PORTIONS CLOSER TO WHAT A SERVING SHOULD BE TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY DIET: \"There is a clear distinction between the term 'serving' and 'portion'. On the one hand, a serving means the size or amount of food that is recommended for you to eat; for example, in the old food pyramid guide, two servings a day are recommended from the protein group. On the other hand, a food portion is what people actually eat. Often these two terms are used interchangeably and people don't feel there is much of a difference. However, because many restaurants are serving bigger and bigger portions and people's perception of what an appropriate portion size looks like is much bigger than what health professionals would recommend; they ar e eating larger quantities of food than they should be. That's why we need to be mindful about keeping our portion sizes appropriate and be careful not to overeat. Remember, even healthy food must be consumed in moderation .\" Page 6 of 14 Version 02 3. USE THE \"PORTION DISTORTION\" POSTER AND THE PROPS TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT A PORTION IS AND WHAT ITS CORRECT SIZE SHOULD BE: \"Now I want to visually show you, with common objects, how serving size and portion relate to each other. The current food guidelines recommend the following servings of grains per day: - 5 ounces for children ages 4-8 - 5 ounces for girls ages 9-13 - 6 ounces for boys ages 9-13 - 6 ounces for women 19-50 - 8 ounces for men 19 -30 (7 ounces for ages 31-50) A serving size equals about 1 ounce of bread which translates to a slice of bread such as this one. A serving of rice is approximately \u00bd cup cooked, like this. You can also visualize a \u00bd cup as being the same size of this racquetbal l. So, you need to eat 6 of those per day.\" \"For fruits, the current daily servings are: - 1-1.5 cups for children ages 4-8 - 1.5 cups for girls ages 9-18 - 1.5 cups for boys ages 9 -13 (2 cups for ages 14-18) - 2 cups for women ages 19 -30 (1.5 cups for ages 31+) - 2 cups for men 19+ For vegetables, the current daily servings are: - 1.5 cups for children ages 4 -8 - 2 cups for girls ages 9 -13 (2.5 cups for ages 14-18) - 2.5 cups for boys ages 9 -13 (3 cups for ages 14-18) - 2.5 cups for women ages 19 -50 (2 cups for ages 51+) - 3 cups for men ages 19 -50 (2.5 cups for ages 51+) A serving of cut fruits or vegetables is about a \u00bd cup. Again, you can also visualize as having the same size of this racquetball. [SHOW \u00bd CUP OF FRUITS AND VEGGIES].\" \"For the protein group which includ es red meat, poultry, fish and legumes such as beans, and nuts, the current recommendation is to eat: - 4 ounces for children ages 4-8 - 5 ounces for girls ages 9-18 - 5 ounces for boys ages 9 -13 (6.5 for ages 14-18) - 5.5 ounces for women ages 19 -30 (5 ounces for ages 31+ Page 7 of 14 Version 02 - 6.5 ounces for men ages 19 -30 (6 ounces for ages 31 -50 y 5.5 ounces for ages 51+) Some examples of food that contain 1 ounce of protein include 1 egg , \u00bc cup cooked beans , or 1 Tablespoon of nut butter . To help you figure out the ounces of meat you normally eat, 3 ounces is usually the size and thickness of your palm or the size and weig ht of this deck of cards.\" \"The recommended daily intake of dairy products is 3 cups or servings (2 cups for children ages 2 -3 years of age and 2.5 cups for children ages 4 -8). In the case of milk or yogurt, a serving would be a full cup like this. In the case of cheese, a serving would equal 1\u00bd ounces or the weight of a thin pre -sliced sandwich slice or 4 dice like these .\" \"Important: Per USDA's Choose MyPlate website, note that these amounts are appropriate for individuals who get less than 30 minutes per day of moderate physical activity, beyond normal daily activities. Those who are more physically active may be able to consume more while staying within calorie needs.\" 4. MYPLATE Topic 10 minutes Purpose The participants will learn about the MyPlate dietary recommendations for the major food groups. Resources Title board: o MYPLATE My plate poster What is on your plate poster \"Can anyone tell me what are the major food groups that should be included in our diets?\" [ACKNOWLEDGE RESPONSES AND POINT TO MYPLATE POSTER AS A PROP TO EXPLAIN THE 5 MAJOR FOOD GROUPS]. Page 8 of 14 Version 02 \"The MyPlate is a communication initiative based on USDA's 2010 dietary gui delines for people living in the United States. It is designed to help people make better food choices. This guideline replaces the Food Pyramid recommendations by making them easier to understand and to follow. As you can see, there are 5 food groups indi cated in it. These are fruits, vegetables, grains (that are used to make breads, cereals, tortillas, oatmeal, and rice), protein (from meat, milk, eggs and legumes), and dairy like milk, yogurt and cheese. This image stresses the importance of a balanced diet at every meal. Of course, you are not going to consume the same proportions of these food groups at every meal. For example, at breakfast you may eat more dairy and fruit products or at dinner you may eat more protein. But overall for your total day f ood intake, the proportions of these foods should be roughly as indicated in the figure. In addition, as you can see, fruits and vegetables would cover about half of the plate with the vegetable portion being slightly higher . The grains and protein should cover the other half of the plate with the grain group being slightly higher . The dairy group is indicated as an important addition to your diet.\" \"The first recommendation for creating a healthy plate is to make half of your plate fruits and vegetables. Fruits and Vegetables are often avoided because they can take more preparation, require washing, might be expensive and can spoil quickly so it is important to find ways to include these in your diets in a way that will wo rk for your family.\" \"Another recommendation is to make at least half of the grains you consume whole grain. That is, of the total amount of grains making up breads, cereals, pasta and rice you eat, they should be whole wheat or brown rice instead of refi ned white bread or rice. This will give you more fiber and a higher nutritional value.\" \"As far as your protein intake, you should try to vary it as much as you can, including poultry and fish as much as possible. This will ensure that you not only will c ut down on red meats but also that you are including the nutritional value of fish and poultry in your diet. Finally, the MyPlate recommends that you consume low -fat milk and cheese. My own opinion is that unless you are consuming large quantities of milk and cheese, over 3 servings a day, or unless you are actively trying to lose weight, you do not need to change your dairy fat.\" Page 9 of 14 Version 02 Now discuss the MyPlate daily dietary recommendations with the participants. W rite them down and also handout a \"What's on your plate\" laminated poster to each of the participants and the plate to the kids: \"One of the nice things about the MyPlate daily serving recommendations is that it is much simpler than the ones in the old fo od pyramid guide. For example, to eliminate the confusion between serving a portion size, the recommendation simply lists the number of cups or ounces that should be eaten. These are basically the same as the number of servings. Now, that you learned what a correct -size portion and thus serving is, let's review how much of each of the major 5 groups we should be eating every day. Please refer to your laminated poster and follow along. For example, for vegetables, the recommended daily intake for girls ages 9-13 is 2 cups. So throughout the day you should try to consume at least 2 cups of vegetables including cut raw or cooked pieces, leafy vegetables, or vegetable juice. For fruits, the recommendation is 1.5 cups a day. Again, this could be freshly cut frui t, dry fruit, or 100% fruit juices. Another note about weight maintenance, if you are trying to lose weight, try to think about eating your fruits and vegetables rather than drinking them in juices. It is an easy way to reduce calories and has more fiber t han the juice forms. For grains (we are still looking at the recommendation for girls ages 9 -13) the recommendation is to eat 5 ounces or servings each day. As we saw, an ounce is equal to one slice of bread or \u00bd cup of rice. The recommendation for dairy products including milk, yogurt and cheese, is to eat 3 cups every day. And finally, the recommendation for protein is to eat 5 ounces on a daily basis. Remember that protein can include different lean meats, poultry, fish and legumes such as beans and nut s. If possible, try to include 8 ounces of fish per week in order to increase the variety of protein, as well as increased exposure to healthy fats such as omega -3s which help maintain healthy cholesterol and decrease risk for heart disease.\" 5.

NUTRITION LABELS Feedback 15 minutes Purpose The participants will learn to read nutrition labels and how to interpret the information from the labels. Resources Title board Nutrition Label poster Nutrition Label Handouts Maruchan Instant Soup Package Mini containers of multiple sugar packets Regular soda can Instructions 1. Write \"NUTRITION LABELS\" on board. 2. Use the \"Nutrition or Food Label\" poster, the Nutrition Label handouts, and the props for discussion. \"Does anyone know how to read nutrition labels? [IF PEOPLE RAISE THEIR HANDS, SAY \"that's great; this will be a review for you.\"] For the rest of you, you will learn something very important today, and we will make it fun. Let's take a look at a nutrition label and talk about the most important things that we should know or be familiar with. The first thing is the serving size. This is the amount of food listed on a product's Nutrition Facts Label. [BASED ON YOUR NUTRITION LABEL EXAMPLE, ADAPT THE REST OF T HIS PARAGRAPH.] In this example, the serving size of this food is 6 crackers . But it's important to point out that many times, a package contains more than one serving. This is why it is important to read the number next to the words \" Servings Per Containe r\", 13 in this case. That means that if you eat the entire package, all the numbers you see next to the categories should be multiplied by 13 . So, if you eat only 6 saltines, or one serving, you will consume 120 calories ; however, if you consume the whole package you will consume 120 x 13 = 1560 calories. Let's look at the nutrition labels more carefully. In here, it says Calories . Does anyone know what calories are? Calories are the amount of energy that our body needs; sort of like gasolines to start a ca r. Does anyone know how many calories people need? [IF SOMEONE SAYS, 2,000, SAY \"yes and no; sometimes I wish answers were straight forward.\"]. The amount of calories we need depends on our age, height, weight, gender, and our daily Page 6 of 16 Version 01 activity level. For example, a woman who is 5' 5\", 160 lbs , 35 years of age, who does light physical activity will need 1,700 -1,900 calories per day to maintain her weight, and 1,200 to 1,400 calories per day if she wants to lose weight. Also, a boy who is 4'1\", 100 lbs, 10 years of age, who does heavy physical a ctivity will need 1650 -1850 calories per day to maintain his weight, and 1150 to 1350 calories per day if he wants to lose weight. [CALORIE KING HAS WEB -BASED CALCULATORS.] http://www.calorieking.com/interactive -tools/how -many - calories -should -you-eat/?ref=nav Different types of foods provide diffe rent amounts of calories. Therefore, we need to choose what we eat wisely. Now, let's talk about the Percent Daily Value ; this is a guide to the nutrients in one serving of food. For example, if the label lists 15% for calcium, it means that one serving provides 15% of the calcium you need each day. The Percent Daily Value is based on a 2,000 calorie diet for healthy adults . The Percent Daily Value can help you determine whether a food is high or low in specific nutrients. An important thing to remember is that if you consume more calories than the body actually needs, your body will end up storing them resulting in weight g ain. One general rule of thumb is that: If a food has 5 percent or less of a nutrient, it's considered to be low in that nutrient. If it has 20 percent or more, it's considered to be high in that nutrient. The next category is fat content . Fat is one of th e three nutrients in our diet. It is important because it provides a concentrated form of energy that helps maintain a normal body temperature and protects our tissues and organs. However, just like excess intake of carbohydrates and proteins can lead to w eight gain, it is important to note that each gram of fat provides more calories per gram than grams of either protein or carbohydrate. As you can see in the poster, the main category is listed as total fat. There are different types of fats, some of which are more important to consume less than others. These are the saturated fats which are solid at room temperature such as butter or lard. The other type is trans fats which are a synthetic (or fake) form of fat used in frying oils for chicken and French fr ies. Trans fats are especially harmful to us because of issues with cholesterol as I will mention shortly. The healthier types of fats which are not often included in the label are monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats which can be obtained from corn, c anola, peanut or olive oils, fish and nuts. The next item listed in a nutrition label is cholesterol . Cholesterol is a type of chemical substance produced by our liver and found in foods from animal sources (eggs, meats, dairy products). There are two main kinds of cholesterol in our blood. This is LDL, which is often referred to as the \"bad\" cholesterol, and HDL, which is the \"good\" cholesterol. As I mentioned earlier, trans fats are especially harmful to us because they lower the good cholesterol and incr ease the bad cholesterol, but poly and monounsaturated fats help make Page 7 of 16 Version 01 the good cholesterol. In the end a balance of appropriate fat and portion control in the diet are key. The next category is sodium. This nutrient is needed in our bodies to maintain our cell stability. However, too much sodium, commonly consumed as table salt or as a preservative in processed foods, can lead to increased blood pressure and increase risk for hypertension. To illustrate this , I'm going to pass around this package of Maruchan Instant Soup. As you can see, the soup's nutrition label indicates that one serving contains 830 mg of sodium . Now, since there are 2 servings per package , this means that by eating the entire package, you will have consumed 1660mg of sodium . So what does that mean? Well, when you read the total daily requirements in the bottom section of the nutritional label, 2400mg of sodium is the maximum requirement . So, just by consuming a package of Maruchan soup you will have consumed more than half or 70% of your daily requirement to be exact. In the example in the poster, one serving of sodium is 180 mg which is 7% of the 2400 mg daily requirement . But since there are 13 servings in this package , if you eat the entire package, you need to multiply the 180 by 13 which gives you 2340mg which is 98% of your daily sodium requirement. These percentage values are called the % Daily Values, which as you can see, are indic ated for most of the nutrients on the label. Packaged or processed foods often contain large quantities of sodium to preserve the contents. This is another reason why it's important to fit in more fresh foods in your cooking. Keep in mind that salt added t o cooking, or at the table, also counts towards your daily values. Only 1 teaspoon of salt equals 2000mg of sodium. A carbohydrate is a second nutrient that we eat. It provides a large amount of energy in our diets. Most carbohydrates are metabolized faste r than fats. For example, if eating steak, rice and salad for dinner, the rice and salad will be digested and the nutrients metabolized first, while the protein and fat in the steak will take longer. Carbohydrates can be divided into complex carbs that are obtained from foods like breads, cereals, pasta, and simple carbohydrates found in sugary products such as candy, soda and jellies. Dietary fiber, which is listed here in the poster, is also a type of carbohydrate, and is often a part of the more complex carbohydrates. Let me turn your attention to the poster here. As you can see, the daily total carbohydrate requirement for a 2000 -calorie diet is 300 grams . So how is that important to me? Well, let's take a look at this little container that is filled wit h the amount of sugar contained in a can of regular soda. Now, each of these sugar packets contains about 3 grams of sugar. A can of soda contains about 12 of these packets of sugar , which means that the total carbohydrate content from sugar in this can is going to be about 36 grams. So by consuming just one can of regular soda , you will have consumed about 12% of your total daily Page 8 of 16 Version 01 requirement of all carbohydrates . Just think of the effect of this and how soda is so popular in our community. We are consuming large amounts of sugar, which not only contributes to our weight increase and increasing the risk for diabetes, but it also can ta ke the place of more nutrient rich carbohydrates like fruits, vegetables and grains. Protein is the third nutrient in our diet and is vital to maintain the proper function of the cells in our blood, to repair damaged tissue and maintain our immune system. Meats, poultry, fish, dairy products, eggs, whole grains, beans, rice, and corn all contain protein. Protein should make up about 25% (or \u00bc as shown in My Plate) of our daily intake. For a 2000 calorie diet this equals about 125 grams (or 500 calories) . Finally, a few nutrients, or vitamin and minerals, are listed in the nutrition label. These chemicals are required to help adjust the body's metabolic function; that is, to help all the biochemical processes in our bodies stay within normal levels. Much can be said about vitamins and minerals. It's important to know that fruits and vegetables naturally contain the amounts that we need, so let's make sure that we consume plenty and different fruits and vegetables. To end the food label discussion, I want to sa y that, to attain a healthier diet, we need to limit or decrease the number of total calories limit unhealthy fats and choose sources of healthy fats like PUFAs and MUFAs (olive oil, canola oil, fish, grass fed meats when able, etc.), and limit the sodium we consume. On the other hand, we need to increase the quantity of potassium, dietary fiber, fruits and vegetables we consume.\" 4. MY FAMILY CAN Page 9 of 16 Version 01 Topic 5 minutes Purpose The participants will come up with a plan to continue to add more fruits or vegetables into their daily family meals.

TRANSITION TO NATURAL VS. PROCESSED. \"We should give ourselves a big round of applause for keeping up with the goals.\" [EVERYONE GIVES A NICE ROUND OF APPLAUSE]. Today, we are going to continue to talk about what we eat. We will talk about natural vs. processed foods.\" 3. NATURAL VS. PROCESSED FOODS Feedback 5 minutes Purpose Participants will learn the difference between natural vs. processed foods. Resources Title board Table Natural and Processed Foods Page 5 of 16 Version 02 Instructions 1. WRITE \"NATURAL VS. PROCESSED FOODS\" on board. \"Now, we are going to talk about natural vs. processed foods. First, I would like to ask for your help in filling this table. I'm going to write down foods that are packaged and claim to have a high nutritional value. I want you to help me with a natural a lternative to these types of foods, and I 'll write your answers on the board.\" Table 1. Examples of Natural and Processed Foods FOODS PROCESSED NATURAL Fruits and vegetables Fruit or vegetable juices, fruits canned in heavy syrup, fruit snacks/fruit roll ups, veggie or potato chips, salted/seasoned nuts Fresh fruits and vegetables Meats Bacon, sausage, chicken fingers, fish sticks, hot dogs, deli meats, potted meats and spam Fresh lean meats, fresh fish/shellfish, eggs Grains Instant rice and beans, processed breads and cereals Natural rice, beans, corn and other grains for meals, bread and cereals Diary Ice cream bars, processed cheese such as Velveeta, sweetened yogurt/parfaits low-fat milk (skim or 1%), plain yogurt, low-fat cheese and cottage cheese Drinks Packaged juices and diet sodas 100% fruit juices, water, or Aguas Frescas \"Traditional Hispanic cooking includes a lot of fresh fruits, vegetables and grains, as well as freshly -butchered meats, which provides a great basis for healthy eating! However, studies have shown that the longer anyone from another country lives in the United States and the need to adapt to a fast -paced society, there is more consumption of packaged or processed foods. While packaged and processed foods save us time in the kitchen, their nutritional values do not compare to that of natural foods. Try to limit the amount of processed or factory -produced foods consumed each week. To be clear, there are many frozen fruits and vegeta bles, as well as some meats and fish that are equally healthy. When looking for an unprocessed frozen food, look at the ingredients label (usually under the Nutrition Facts label) and if all it lists is the food item being sold, then it is unprocessed. For example, if a bag of frozen peas says \"Ingredients: peas\" then that is just as healthy as buying fresh peas\" [SHOW REAL EXAMPLE.] \"It can be very confusing because we think that commercial products are healthy because they are made from natural foods such as juices that come from oranges or potato chips that say they are made from natural potatoes. But don't forget that the manufacturing process to Page 6 of 16 Version 02 produce these items include adding high amounts o f sugars, salts or other synthetic additives to enhance the flavors or help these items last longer on the shelf. The addition of all of these chemicals reduces the nutritional value of the original natural foods and the added salt and sugar can increase r isk of, or worsen, illnesses such as diabetes, and hypertension and increase risk for weight gain.\" 4. ORGANIC FOOD PRODUCTS Topic 5 minutes Purpose Participants will understand the definition of organic food products and its benefits. Resources Board title \"ORGANIC FOOD LABEL\" poster Food items (fruits, vegetables and packaged food) containing the USDA \"Organic Food\" label (optional) Instructions 1. WRITE \"ORGANIC FOOD PRODUCTS\" board. Begin by asking the participants what comes to thei r mind when they hear organic food . \"What comes to your mind when you hear the word organic food?\" 2. WRITE DOWN THE PARTICIPANTS' RESPONSES, ACKNOWLEDGE THEM AND CONTINUE TO THE NEXT STEP. \"The word 'organic' is basically a labeling term that indicates that the product was produced through certain methods that promote recycling of resources, ecological balance, and biodiversity conservation. This term can be applied to agricultural products, meats, poultry, eggs, and dairy products. So, what a re the ways in which food products can be called organic? Well, the federal government has established that pesticides and synthetic or sewer -sludge fertilizers are not used in agricultural products; that genetically -engineered seeds are not used for crops ; that Page 7 of 16 Version 02 antibiotics are not used in farm animals for meat or milk production; and finally, that artificial ingredients or synthetic additives are not used in plant or animal products.\" NOW EXPLAIN WHY ORGAN IC FOOD IS IMPORTANT TO US. \"So why are organic foods important for us? Well, if a product is truly organically -produced, it will be good for our health in the sense that we are not consuming traces of pesticides many of which have been shown to increase risk of cancer. In the same way, we will avoid chemical fertilizers or avoid potential disease if we consume products grown in human waste -derived fertilizers. We will also avoid consumption of additives and other chemicals that could potentially cause ill ness. Additionally, we will avoid consuming traces of antibiotics or growth hormones from meat and dairy products. By following all of these guidelines in food production, the quality of the food is increased and thus, our health is better protected. But that's not all. Organically -produced foods also help protect the environment by not having all kinds of different chemicals go into the soil. This leaves nature in a more balanced state with no added material that overtime damages it permanently. And since we are part of the environment, it will help protect our health.\" NOW USE THE ORGANIC FOOD LABEL POSTER TO TALK ABOUT USDA LABELING. \"Let's talk a little about what the government's organic label means. This is the official label used by the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA is a government agency responsible for establishing and enforcing rules regarding agricultu ral products. As you can see, the label simply says 'USDA Organic'; this means that the product is certified to be at least 95% organic . This leaves some room for products that require the use or addition of a small amount of non -organic material. Again, t his applies to fruits and vegetables and packaged materials such as milk, soups, grains, etc., that have been produced with methods that meet the organic labeling guidelines. There are other rules that apply to organic foods. For example, if a product con tains less than 70% organic ingredients, the government will allow a manufacturer to list the organic ingredients as organic on the side of the box , but will not allow the front of the package to be labeled organic. I'm going to pass around these products that are labeled as organic for you to look at so you can get an idea of what I'm talking about.\" TRANSITION TO THE NEXT SECTION. Page 8 of 16 Version 02 \"OK, now that we understand what organic means and how to interpret an \"organic food\" label, we will continue to talk next week about whether organic food items are right for your family.\" 5. ARE ORGANIC FOODS FOR YOUR FAMILY? Feedback 10 minutes Purpose Participants will be empowered to make the best choice whether to purchase organic or conventional foods . Resources Title board Instructions 2. WRITE \"ARE ORGANIC FOODS FOR YOUR FAMILY\" ON BOARD. 3. SHOW THE TABLE (SEE BELOW) AND USE THE EXAMPLES IN THE TABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY SOME FOOD PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED AS ORGANIC VS. NOT AND THE PROS AND THE CONS OF ORGANIC VS NOT. \"Last week, we talked about the benefits that organic food products bring to human health and the environment. Today, let's talk about how this happens.\" Topic Food type Process Pros Cons Cost Insect control Conventional Use of pesticides, fungicides, herbicides Larger yields, Stronger F&Vs Traces of dangerous chemicals Lower Organic Use of beneficial insects, mating disruption, traps No risk of chemical exposure on people Less product yield, Insects are hard to maintain Higher Topic Food type Process Pros Cons Cost Animal products Conventional Use of hormones and antibiotics on animals Higher meat and dairy yields Traces of hormones and antibiotics Lower Organic Feed animals organic foods like grains; give more space and care to animals No risk of exposure on people Lower product yield and higher production cost Higher Page 9 of 16 Version 02 Topic Food type Process Pros Cons Cost Plant products Conventional Use of genetically -altered seeds Higher and disease - resistant modified yields Economic disadvantage to small farmers; exposure to people Lower Organic Use natural seeds No risk of exposure on people Fragile and less - abundant yields Higher Topic Food type Process Pros Cons Cost Bacterial or fungal contamin ation Conventional Use of irradiation Reduces bacterial/fungal contamination Exposure to irradiated products on people Lower Organic Use of home methods to prevent microbial contamination No exposure of irradiated products on people Chance of bacterial/fungal contamination Higher Topic Food type Process Pros Cons Cost Food spoilage Conventional Use of preservatives and additives Shelf life extended Exposure of chemicals on people Lower Organic No added chemicals No risk of chemical exposure on people Shorter self -life Higher 3. Transition to the next section: \"As you saw on the table, there are many health benefits of eating organic food products, but there are also drawbacks; for example, it's more costly than conventional food products. But, you don't have to buy all your food organic. There are some food pro ducts that tend to retain more pesticides than others. And you may choose to avoid those. Now, let's go back to those piles that you separate them earlier today, and talk more about them.\" 6. OFFENDERS VS. CLEANEST Discussion 10 minutes Purpose Participants will learn about food products that tend to retain more pesticides. Page 10 of 16 Version 02 Resources Title board \"OFFENDERS\" cards \"CLEANEST\" cards Instructions 1. Write \"OFFENDERS VS. CLEANEST\" on board. 2. Use the cards \"top offenders\" and \"top cleanest\" for this lesson. \"According to the Environmental Working Group, the \"offenders\" are foods that are reported to retain the highest chemical residue from pesticides and therefore may be better to buy o rganic. On the other hand, the \"cleanest\" foods have the least chemical exposure and thus may be option for people who do not want to buy them organic.\" \"In the beginning of the class, we asked you to separate pictures of fruits and vegetables into two s eparate piles. Now, let's see how we did. [REVIEW ANSWER; SEE RESOURCES]. Other food products that we tend to eat often and are known to retain a lot of pesticide residues are fresh tomatoes, cilantro, and lettuce. At the same time, food products such as avocados, corns, asparagus, and rice tend to retain less pesticide residues. So, although it may be difficult for your family to completely switch to organic from one day to the next, your family may want to think about substituting some of the food product s (especially those that retain high pesticides residues) to organic products.\" \"We also wanted to tell you a few general tips for handling food products. Do not purchase produce with visible mold, bruises or cuts and buy only the amount you will be able to use in a week. Opt to buy fruits and vegetables that are in season . This will assure higher likelihood of freshness. They also tend to be more economic than usual . Conventional (non -organic) food products may contain pesticides residues on the surfaces, so make sure to wash, scrub, and disinfect them properly. Similarly, organic foods also need to be washed to remove fertilizer, bacteria and insects. Use cool running water and scrub and remove pesticides and dirt immediately before you plan to eat or cook the produce. With certain foods you can always peel, but it may cause you to lose some of the fiber content. Page 11 of 16 Version 02 Wash a ll produce. Even if you plan to remove a peal; be sure to wash the produce thoroughly so bacteria from the peel are not transferred to the edible part by the knife. You can buy a vegetable brush to scrub surfaces of produce you will not peel, such as squas h, potatoes, apples, cucumbers, etc. Refrigerate fresh produce within 2 hours of peeling or cutting. Discard cooked vegetables after three to four days . Finally, read your food labels! Just because a product says organic, it does not always mean it is heal thier; especially with processed and packaged foods. Some may still have higher sugar, salt, fat, or caloric content. 7. MY FAMILY CAN Topic 10 minutes Purpose The participants will continue learn to identify organic labels in food products. Participants will also continue to make a plan for adding physical activity into their daily life. Resources Title board My Family Can...Handout (Nutrition) Instructions 1.

If gardening is something you are well versed in, I hope that you wi ll share your knowledge with the class today to help others start gardening. First off, why garden? What's the point when we can go down the street to the supermarket and find vegetables and fruits? [WRITE DOWN REASONS FOR GARDENING ON BOARD]. The benefit s of gardening are as abundant of the garden's crop itself! Gardening burns calories - gardening can be physical activity. Light gardening burns about 330 calories an hour. You'll try new tastes - there are countless examples of research that show that yo uth that refuse to try vegetables in most circumstances will take a risk and try a vegetable in the garden that they have helped to grow. One example of this is a sixth grade class that grew kale, harvested it, and made kale chips for snacks. Kale chips ar e now a favorite snack at the school. Kids learn responsibility - gardening tasks can be delegated according to age and a child's ability. This allows even the littlest members of your family a sense of ownership and competence. Children learn firsthand th at if they plant a seed, water and take care of it, it will grow into a plant that can provide them food. Saves money - the cost for seeds, is minimal for the amount of produce you could receive (one seed is between 3 -10 cents). A garden allows for fresh an d great tasting organically grown food that costs tiny in comparison to the grocery store. And if you plan well, you can have food from summer, early fall and even the winter months. Healthy Food right at your back door - you know what you put into your garden. When you have your own garden you can ensure that your family gets fresh food that is thoroughly safe and is the most 'local' you can get. Starting a Kitchen Garden Let's take a couple of minutes to discuss the steps for starting to garden. It always helps to start with a plan. Choose your location. Page 6 of 13 Version 02 Are you starting from a patch of lawn, using raised beds, or using containers? Either way, you want to choose a location that gets full sun (at le ast six hours of direct sunlight per day), and one where the soil drains well. If you are using containers, container plants tend to dry and wilt more quickly than plants in the ground. So you need to be aware of the amount of direct sunlight, and if place d on a covered porch or patio or close to a wall, be aware of the ambient heat. Once you have figured out what will work best for you, the next step is to define your kitchen garden goals. We recommend for first gardeners to start small (NEED TO PROVIDE EX AMPLES OF WHAT IT MEANS TO START SMALL), tuck a few successes under your belt in one year, and scale up little by little. If you are really interested in gardening, even in one year, you may be able to meet your family's produce needs. Prepare the Garden S ite Whether planting directly in the ground or raised beds, you will need to decide what to do with the sod/grass. You can remove it and compost it, which is hard work but it makes sure you don't have grass and weeds coming up in your garden. If using con tainers figure out what kinds of containers work best for you, whether it's repurposed items like coffee cans, kiddie pools, plastic sandboxes, storage bins, wooden crates, guttering, buckets or reused nursery pots make sure you have good soil and ample dr ainage. If possible drill or punch several holes in the container as over and under watering are the number 1 cause of plant failure. Choosing the right plants/crops Once you have your plants, location and or containers, the sky's the limit! The most important recommendation after \"start small\" is \"start with what you like to eat\". One of the easiest and most rewarding kitchen gardens is a simple salad garden. Lettuces and other greens don't require much space or maintenance, and grow quickly. Natural cooking enhancers like herbs such as parsley, chives, sage, basil, tarragon, mint, rosemary and thyme. If using containers many tomato, zucchini, cucumber and pepper plants do well as \"patio\" varieties. Consider the depth of the container and the plant's r oot system. Carrots for example don't do well in standard pots, but lettuce does. How to Plant - Get Growing! There are two ways you can plant. You can plant seeds or transplant seedlings. You can plant the seeds of crops like peas and beans directly into your garden soil, while other crops like tomatoes need to be started indoors and later transplanted outside. Hardy vegetable for growing include: peas, beans, lettuce, melons, cucumbers, broccoli, peppers, onions, tomatoes, Page 7 of 13 Version 02 and radishes. If you are unsure on whether to plant the inside or outside to start, check out the seed packet. How to Read a Seed Packet The back of your vegetable seed packets provide a lot of great information to help the gardener be successful. No matter what company you buy your seeds from, there will be helpful information. Plant Information Your seed packet will provide you with information on what the vegetable will look like either by color, by shape, and/or by size. Where to Plant Information on the location of the plant in a garden is also provided. In general, a good vegetable garden must have at least six hours of full sun each day in order for full maturity. Fences can help keep animals out. Some packets will suggest planting by a fence (or a trellis) so the fence can be used for supporting some of the plants. When to Plant Your seed packet will provide you the basic information you need for when to plant. There may also be a map with the months that your vegetables can be planted based on the area of the country. How to Plant The seed packets will also provide information on how to plant the seeds: the space needed for the plant and how deep they must be planted. In general, the length of two seeds is how deep one should plant their seed. Planting depth will also depend on your soil. Seed can be planted slightly deeper in sandy soils and closer to the surface in clay soils. Cover seeds with soil and lightly press or pat the ar ea, do not compact the soil. When to Water Water as soon as you plant your seeds. Water lightly as to not uncover the seeds. Each day make sure the soil is moist. You want moist soil until sprouts appear. Then water as needed. Page 8 of 13 Version 02 During dry periods (no rain), vegetable gardens need extra watering. Most vegetables will benefit from an inch or more water each week. Use of a soaker hose will help free up your time to check your plants or pull weeds that have sprouted. If you are using containers for your gardening [PLEASE DEMONSTRATE THIS TECHNIQUE VISUALLY] Wait for the plant to show very slight signs of wilt, then add water. Feel the soil \u2014poke your finger down about an inch; if it's dry to that depth, then water. Pick up the pot when it's dry and gauge its weight; when the pot feels light, that's a clue that it's time to water. Top watering \u2014use a spouted watering can to apply water on the surface of the soil (not on the plant), until you see water pouring out the drainage hole at the bottom. Bottom watering \u2014set the container (or nursery pot) into a bucket or saucer of water, saturating the root system through the drainage hole. When to Fertilize Fertilizing is not necess ary while waiting for seeds to germinate (emerge from the soil). Compost and aged manure can supply nutrients to plants after they have sprouted. Synthetic liquid fertilizer like Miracle Grow can be applied after seeds have sprouted and developed two sets of leaves. Then you will need to add liquid fertilizer to every other watering of the vegetables. If using Synthetic solid fertilizers, add to the soil and work in with a hand claw or hand shovel. Synthetic fertilizers do not provide benefits to soil healt h like the addition of organic matter which supports a healthy growing environment. Use of synthetic fertilizers should be limited for this reason. When to Harvest The types of vegetables you grow will also determine when you will be ready to harvest. The days till harvest on the seed packet will help you on when you should start getting ready to be on the lookout to harvest your vegetables. Enjoy your harvest! When your fruits or vegetables are ready for harvest, plan a family dinner together! Consider sharing your extra harvest with neighbors, friends or family members. To end our gardening discussion, I want to say that gardening can be fun and doesn't have to be a lot of hard work. The key to a kitchen garden is Choosing your location - in the ground in containers Prepare your garden site Page 9 of 13 Version 02 Choose crops right for you and your family - Start small if gardening is new!

Resources Page 5 of 14 Version 02 PowerPoint Title board Smart Shopping Poster Game Plan Tip Sheet Smart Shopping Tip Sheet Instructions 1. Use the \"Smart Shopping\" poster, and the tip sheets for discussion. Today's workshop is focused on how we can make healthy choices and shop within our budget. In the current economy, many of us are living on a budget and looking for ways to reduce food expenses while still enjoying tasty, nutritious meals. With the right tips and a little planning, it is possible to enjoy healthy food on a fixed or limited budget. Maki ng smart choices saves money. So the first step in new activity is to make a plan . Step 1. Plan ahead before you shop Before heading to the grocery store, make a \"game plan\". So what's a game plan? It's just simply taking the time to think about your budget, your shopping needs before you go and shop. This can help you get organized and save money. It also allows you to rethink you food choices and pick healthier options. Things you should think about when making your plan are: What is your grocery budget? Do you shop weekly, buy in bulk but then weekly for fresh produce? The first step in any plan is to figure out how much money you have available in your food budget. Once you kn ow how much you can spend weekly or monthly on food it's then easier to make a specific food plan. Plan meals and snacks for the week according to your budget. This means taking the time to look at your week, and plan a grocery list accordingly. If there a re after school activities, evening church events or activities that you are aware of, think about your schedule. Choose meals you can prepare easily on your busiest days. Save recipes that take longer for days off or less busy. Shop according to your week ly needs. Step 2. Make a grocery list. Before making a list, write down meals you want to make for the week. Buying for the week means you will make fewer shopping trips and buy only items you need. Here are a few tips [USE BOARD TO LIST TIPS]: Page 6 of 14 Version 02 1) Look in your freezer, cabinets, and refrigerator. Make a note of what you currently have on hand. You can save money by using these items in the upcoming week's meals. 2) Use a worksheet [HAND OUT GROCERY PLA N WORKSHEET] to plan your meals and figure out what items you need to buy. 3) Create a list of recipes to try. Find new ideas for healthy and low -cost meals based on what you have on hand, foods your family enjoys, and foods that are good buys. Include meals that will \"stretch\" expensive food items (stews, casseroles, stir -fries). Be sure to include some family favorites along with any new recipes. 4) If you have access online, find quick and easy healthy recipes online. Use tools such as the USDA interactive website What's Cooking? USDA Mixing Bowl . This type of tool can help with healthy meal planning, cooking, and grocery shopping. Step 3: Shop to get the most value out of your budget - Shop Smart to fill your cart! The smartest shoppers know th at saving money is more than luck. When shopping for groceries, it is about having a game plan and making smart decisions about what to put in your cart. Let's go over 12 of the best tips for smart shopping [HAND OUT \"SHOP SMART TO FILL YOUR CART - TO FOLL OW ALONG] There are so many shopping tips out there, so we are going to focus on tips that are budget friendly, and provide healthier options. Let's break it down by food group. Fruits and Vegetables [HAND OUT \"PRODUCE IN SEASON CHART\" TIP SHEET] Buy \"in season\" produce. These are usually less expensive and are at their peak flavor. Buy only what you can use before it spoils. Try buying canned. Choose fruit canned in 100% fruit juice and vegetables with \"low - sodium\" or \"no salt added\" on the label. These products are just as nutritious as fresh, and often cost less. When buying canned, buy store brands as they are often cheaper. If you have freezer space, buy frozen vegetables without added sauces or butter. They are as good for you as fresh and may cost less. Canned and frozen fruits and vegetables last much longer than fresh and it's a quick way to add fruits and vegetables to your meal. Precut fruit and vegetables, while convenient, usually cost more. Grains (bread, pasta, cereal) Page 7 of 14 Version 02 Make half your grains whole grains. Throughout the store, check ingredient lists and pick the items that have a whole grain listed first. Whole grains include whole wheat, brown rice, bulgur, buckwheat, oa tmeal, whole - grain cornmeal, whole oats and whole rye. Rice and pasta are budget -friendly grain options Choose hot cereals like plain oatmeal or whole grain dry cereal Try new whole grain snack ideas, like switching to whole -wheat crackers or popping your own popcorn. Protein Foods Some great low cost choices include beans and peas, such as kidney and pinto beans, split peas, and lentils. Use these good sources of protein for main or side dishes. Beans and peas cost far less than a similar amount of other protein foods. To lower meat costs, buy the family -sized or value pack and freeze what you don't use. Choose lean meats like chicken or turkey. When choosing ground beef, make sure it's lean (92% lean 8% fat) ground beef. Seafood doesn't have to be expensive, Try buying canned tuna, salmon or sardines. These store well and are a low cost option. Don't forget eggs. They are a great low -cost option that's easy to prepare. Dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese) Choose low -fat or fat -free milk. They provide just as much calcium, but fewer calories than whole and 2% milk. Buy the larger size of low -fat plain yogurt instead of individual flavored yogurts. You can add your own flavors by mixing in fruits. When it comes to cheese, look for \"reduced fat\" o r \"low -fat\" on the label. Always check the sell by date to make sure you are buying the freshest dairy products. Note that stores often stock shelves from back to front, placing the newest items behind the older ones. Reach in the back for the freshest ite ms. Others Drink water instead of buying sodas or other sugary drinks. Tap water is easy on your wallet and has zero calories. It's easy to infuse your water with fresh fruits like lemons, oranges or cucumbers for added flavor. A reusable water bottle is a great way to have water with you on the go. Save time, money and calories by skipping the chip and cookie aisles. Page 8 of 14 Version 02 And for final t ips - keep these 5 rules in mind! 1) Buy groceries when you are not hungry and when you are not too rushed. Grocery shopping hungry can lead to impulse buying and unhealthy food choices 2) Use coupons - but only for items you know you will use. If you don't nee d an item right away, save the coupon and see if it goes on sale. Try to combine coupons with items on sale for more savings. 3) Look up and down for savings. Stores often stock the priciest items at eye level. You can save big by looking at the upper and lower shelves too. 4) Shop the perimeter of the store first. This way you will fill your cart with healthy whole foods like fresh produce and meat, leaving less room for the \"junk food fillers\" and thus save money. 5) Stick to the grocery list! The more prepared you are when you get in the store the less impulse purchases you will make. To end the Smart Shopping discussion, I want to say that we went through a lot of useful tips. The handouts can be used to help you make your shopping plan in the future. The key points that I would like to remind you of one last time are: Make a plan! Every lifestyle change can be successful with a plan of action to help guide you in the healthy eating choices and shopping for those foods. Make a list! Writing out a list b efore shopping and taking it with you is an anchor to help you stay focused on your list and within your budget. Take Time! It takes time to make a plan, write out your list and shop without being rushed. It may seem overwhelming at first, but like any lif estyle change it takes a few weeks of trying before it becomes habit and part of your routine. 4.

A good cool -down is often neglected, due to time or the thought that it's just not needed. But taking a few minutes to cool -down is important. Gradually slow down your pace until you are at a slow walk As you progress to yo ur cool -down after a workout, your body is given a chance to slowly allow your heart rate and blood pressure to return to normal. When you cool down, you give blood a chance to re - circulate throughout your body, which also reduces your risk of fainting an d dizziness. When stretching exercises are part of your workout routine, it's best to do them after the warm -up or cool -down phase, when your muscles are already warm. Stretching helps prevent muscle soreness, stiffness and injury with a good cool -down. H old each stretch 10 to 30 seconds. The stretch should be strong, but not painful. If you feel you need more, stretch the other side and return for another set of stretching. Breathe while you're stretching. Exhale as you stretch, inhale while holding the s tretch.
