Types of massage therapy offered may differ at listed locations Craniosacral Therapy (CST) Craniosacral therapy (CST) is a gentle hands-on treatment that may provide relief from a variety of symptoms including headaches, neck pain and side effects of cancer treatment among many others. CST uses a light touch to examine membranes and movement of fluids in and around the central nervous system. Relieving tension in the central nervous system promotes a feeling of well-being by eliminating pain and boosting health and immunity. The therapist uses gentle pressure techniques to assess the existence of possible disruptions and/or restrictions in your fascial system. Light touch and fascial release may help your muscles and organs naturally relieve stress, which improves function. Other patients often report feeling a sense of deep relaxation. CST can benefit almost everyone. With a few conditions, however, craniosacral therapy may not be appropriate, and you'll need to talk with your CST practitioner and physician. Your session needs to wait if you have experienced any of the following and have NOT been released for treatment by your physician: - Recent concussion - Cerebral swelling - Structural defects in the cerebellum such as Arnold-Chiari malformation - Brain aneurysm - Traumatic brain injury - Blood clots - Any disorder that causes instability of cerebral fluid pressure, flow or build-up Cupping Deep Tissue Integrative Massage Myofascial Release Therapy Manual Lymphatic Drainage Neuromuscular Therapy Neuromuscular massage therapy is a specialized form of massage that involves firm, sustained, and controlled pressure over painful, tight bands of muscle called trigger points.
