Indian healthcare industry overview Figure 1: Segmenting India's healthcare market The Indian healthcare sector can be broadly categorised into pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumables and healthcare services. HLL's operation span across the entire healthcare value chain with a focus on addressing underserved reproductive health needs. Indian pharmaceutical sector 2 Indian pharmaceutical sector is estimated USD 42 billion in 2021 and ranks 13th in value terms and 3rd in volume terms worldwide. With over 10,500 manufacturing units and the largest number of US FDA approved facilities outside the US, India has emerged as a leader in generics manufacturing. The Indian drugs and pharmaceuticals sector received cumulative FDIs worth USD 17.99 billion between April 2000 and March 2021. India is the largest exporter of formulations in terms of volume, with 14% market share and ranks 12th in terms of export value. India's drugs and pharmaceutical exports stood at USD 24.44 billion in FY 2021. India's cost of production is ~33% lower than that of the US as of 2019, which is a source of competitive advantage in the exports market. On the domestic front, Indian pharmaceutical market is expected to grow threefold in the next decade in terms of market size to USD 120-130 billion by 2030. Medicine spending in India is expected to increase at 9-12% CAGR from 2020 to 2025, leading India to become one of the top 10 countries in terms of medicine spending. Increase in the size of middle-class households coupled with the improvement in medical infrastructure and increase in 2 IBEF pharmaceutical report Pharmaceuticals Medical devices & consumables Healthcare services Formulations Diagnostics Hospitals Medical equipment Hospital consumables Others HLL presence Indian healthcare market API Preliminary Information Memorandum PwC Page 87 of 147 the penetration of health insurance in the country will be the key drivers for growth of the domestic pharmaceuticals market. Indian medical equipment and consumables market The medical device industry in India was estimated at USD 10.36 billion in 2020 and is set to grow at 37% CAGR to reach USD 50 billion by 2025. Currently, India is counted among the top 20 global medical devices market and is the 4th largest medical devices market in Asia following Japan, China and South Korea.3 Medical equipment and consumables industry has strong growth prospects, driven by multiple factors like rise in affordability levels, growing hospitalisation rates, greater reach of modern healthcare infrastructure and thrust towards improving availability of healthcare services for underserved sections of the society. Indian healthcare sector The hospital industry in India was estimated at USD 193.83 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach USD 372 billion by 2022.4 Within the healthcare system, diagnostic services play the role of an information intermediary, providing useful information for correct diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Diagnostic services have lower share in overall healthcare spends (~4% of total) but play a vital role in identifying problem areas and major illnesses. Increased disposable incomes, rising insurance penetration, urbanisation, private investments and government inclusion initiatives will drive the growth in the Indian healthcare sector. With a view to move towards universal health coverage, the government has announced the National Health Protection Scheme, which will provide coverage of up to INR 5 lakhs per family per year to 10 crore poor families. This scheme will cover around 50 crore people and will be the largest of its kind in the world.5 3 IBEF medical devices industry report 4 IBEF healthcare industry report 5 https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/ayushman-bharat-national-health-protection-mission Preliminary Information Memorandum PwC Page 88 of 147 7. Indian reproductive healthcare market Figure 2: Segmenting India's reproductive health segment The Indian reproductive health sector can be broadly categorised into contraceptives, gynaecological formulations and male reproductive wellness products. The contraceptives segment may be further divided into barrier (male and female condoms, IUDs, tubal rings, etc.) and non-barrier contraceptives (OCPs and injectable contraceptives) markets. Gynaecological formulations include products for female reproductive wellness such as menstrual cycle regulators, ovulation inducers, pregnancy supplements, pregnancy management formulations, hormones and others. Male reproductive wellness products include erectile dysfunction formulations, fertility supplements, hormones and others. 7.1. Indian contraceptives market India - male condom wellness products HLL Product Male reproductive wellness products Barrier contraceptives Non-barrier contraceptives Indian reproductive health market Gynaec formulations Consumables Condoms Other barrier contraceptives Moods, Nirodh, Ustad Novex, Unpill, Saheli Preliminary Information Memorandum PwC Page 89 of 147 Male condoms were first introduced in India in the 1960s, when the government decided to offer affordable condoms under the 'Nirodh' brand as a method of population control. HLL was incorporated in 1966 to produce barrier contraceptives for 'Nirodh' brand and other brands to support government's family planning programmes. Currently, condoms are marketed to Indian consumers through the following three different channels: Free supply : Distribution of condoms free-of-cost for family planning and HIV / AIDS prevention programmes of the central and state governments of India and allied governmental and non- governmental organisations. HLL has hitherto served as a captive unit for the manufacture of condoms for GoI initiatives. Social marketing : Marketing of condoms at subsidised prices through institutional and retail channels to meet social welfare objectives. HLL, along with other government and non-government organisations are currently involved in social marketing of condoms under \"Nirodh\", \"Masti\" and \"Ustad\" brands. Social marketing initiatives have played a key role in increased adoption of condoms as a method of contraception in rural and semi-urban India. Retail channel / brand marketing : Condoms sold through the private distribution channels are a key segment of the urban Indian market. Branded products of this segment typically reach consumers through retail and chemist channels. HLL and various private sector players compete on the basis of pricing, product quality, features, and brand positioning in this market. HLL's brand Moods is the second- largest brand in this segment and competes with the likes of Manforce (by Mankind), KamaSutra (by JK Investo), Skore (TTK Healthcare) and Durex (Reckitt Benckiser). Condoms have been supplied for the family planning and HIV / AIDS control programme through two schemes of MoHFW - free supply scheme and social marketing scheme. Intra Uterine Contraceptive / Device (IUC / IUD) The global IUD market was estimated at USD 4.23 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach USD 5.89 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 5.1% during the forecast period of 2021 to 2027. The global IUD market is broadly segmented based on the type and product. Based on the type, the market is further segmented into hormonal intrauterine device and copper intrauterine device market.6 Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs) OCPs can be categorised as steroidal (daily), non-steroidal (once-a-week) and emergency contraceptive pills. The Department of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for implementation of the national family welfare programme by, inter-alia, encouraging the utilisation of contraceptives and distribution of the same to the states / UTs through free supply scheme and PPP under social marketing scheme. The channel for supply of these contraceptives under free supply scheme is government network comprising sub-centres, primary health centres, community health centres and government hospitals, state AIDS control societies throughout the country. The national family welfare programme initiated the social marketing programme of condoms in 1968 and that of oral pills in 1987. Under the social marketing programme, both condoms and oral pills are made available to the people at highly subsidised rates, through diverse outlets. The extent of subsidy ranges from 70% to 85% 6 Global Intrauterine Devices (IUDs) Market - BlueWeave Consulting Preliminary Information Memorandum PwC Page 90 of 147 depending upon the procurement price in a given year. Both these contraceptives are distributed through Social Marketing Organisations (SMOs). HLL is the chief SMO under both categories. The quantities given to the states under free supply scheme during the last 5 years is given in the following tables: Quantities supplied to states / UTs Contraceptive 2016 - 2017 2017 - 2018 2018 - 2019 2019 - 2020 2020 - 2021# Condoms (in million pieces) 433 527 0.0 378 397 Oral pills (in lakh cycles) 312 275 394 592 473 IUDs (in lakh pieces) 48 23 89 88 74 Tubal rings (in lakh pairs) 6 15 12 19 22 Emergency contraceptive pills (in lakh packs) 61 50 128 196 132 Centchroman contraceptive pills (lakh strips) 7 24 170 117 118 Injectable contraceptives (lakh doses) 0 27 0 32 29 Pregnancy test kits (in lakhs) 125 180 187 293 212 # upto 31st November 2021 Performance of social marketing programme in sale of contraceptives Contraceptive 2016 - 2017 2017 - 2018 2018 - 2019 2019 - 2020 2020 - 2021* Condoms (in million pieces) 399 483 460 508 92 Oral pills (social marketing) (in lakh cycles) 194 205 159 147 16 * upto 31st November 2021, figures are provisional HLL pioneered the use of non-steroidal oral contraceptive pills in India. Centchroman (ormeloxifene 30mg), the world's first non-steroidal Pill was launched as \"SAHELI\" by HLL in 1991. Extensive research carried out by the CDRI, Lucknow has proved the drug Centchroman to be highly safe by the medical fraternity. SAHELI, a once-a- week pill is more convenient to use and free from side effects that are associated with conventional hormonal oral contraceptives. HLL also promotes ormeloxifene 30 mg ethically, under the brand name NOVEX. Brands Mala-N and Mala-D are manufactured specifically for supplies to the GoI. Mala-N is supplied free of cost through all PHCs, urban Preliminary Information Memorandum PwC Page 91 of 147 family centres etc. whereas Mala-D is made available to the consumer through social marketing at a minimal price. Other social marketing brands manufactured by HLL are Arpan, Khushi, Ecros, Sunehri, Apsara, Pearl, etc. HLL also markets a double dosage ormeloxifene tablet in the brand name 'NOVEX-DS'. It is an ideal medication for a long term dysfunctional uterine bleeding management. In the steroidal segment of oral contraceptive pills, HLL is marketing formulation containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol, under the brand names NOGESTOL and ARPAN. 7.2. Reproductive health market: growth drivers Some of the factors that are driving the adoption and usage of reproductive health products in the country are: Increasing awareness The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) estimated that 2.14 million people lived with HIV/AIDS in India in 2017,7 a number surpassed only by South Africa and Nigeria worldwide (as of 2018). This highlights the importance of the condom usage in a country like India. Figure 3: Increasing awareness of sexually transmitted diseases Persons in the age range 15-49, all figures in percentage Source: National family health survey There has been a steady increase in awareness of sexual related diseases and contraceptives. With increasing awareness programs and the reach of internet, there will be more knowledge and acceptability on reproductive health Large population in reproductive age 7 National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) annual report 2018 - 2019 21.6%20.9% - 2016Women who have comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS (%) Women who know the importance of contraceptives in reducing STD (%) Men who know the importance of contraceptives in reducing STD (%) Preliminary Information Memorandum PwC Page 92 of 147 Figure 4: Percentage of population in various age groups Source: Edelweiss report on India retail India is a very young country with 50% of the population under the age of 24. The younger population is more aware about problems related to reproductive health and there is more acceptability with respect to the topic.

On an arms-length basis from existing business activities of the Confirmed Selected Bidder or any related parties thereof 17. The ultimate beneficial owner for any IB should not be the same as that of any other IB or of any Consortium Member. In case of a Consortium, the Ultimate Beneficial Owner of any member of the Consortium should not be the same as that of any member of any other Consortium or that of any sole bidder. In this regard, the IB/consortium member shall submit an undertaking in form of Annexure 1A.

The Bidder further acknowledges that the confidentiality obligations contained in this Undertaking shall survive even if the Bidder fails to submit an expression of interest as per the terms and conditions mentioned in the PIM. 10. The Receiving Party shall not deal or communicate (except in the ordinary course of its business) with any officer, director or employee of the Government or the Company regarding the business, operations, prospects or finances of the Company, without the Advisors' prior written consent, unless otherwise agreed to in executed definitive agreements entered into in connection with the purchase by the Bidder and the Consortium Members and / or any company formed and promoted by them, of equity shares of Preliminary Information Memorandum PwC Page 135 of 147 the Company. It is understood that the Advisors will arrange for appropriate contacts for due diligence purposes in connection with the Transaction. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Advisors in writing (i) all communications regarding any possible transaction, (ii) any requests for additional information, (iii) any requests for management meetings, and (iv) any queries regarding the Transaction, will be directed exclusively to the Advisors. However, if the Receiving Party is called upon by the Government and / or the Company for any discussions regarding the Transaction, the Receiving Party will do so or meet the Government and / or the Company only after duly informing the Advisors in writing. 11. The Government reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals made by the Receiving Party with regard to the Transaction and to terminate discussions and negotiations with the Receiving Party at any time. Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, nothing in this Undertaking (i) requires either the Bidder or the Government to enter into the Transaction or to negotiate such Transaction for any specified period of time or (ii) requires the Advisors, the Government or the Company to enter into an agreement or an understanding, or prohibits the Advisors, the Government or the Company from entering into any agreement or understanding, for proceeding with the Transaction with any other Person. 12. For a period of 1 year from the date of this Undertaking or till six months from the completion of the Transaction, whichever is later, the Receiving Party, unless selected as the Successful Bidder, shall not, directly, or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any employee of the Company. 13. The Receiving Party agrees that from the date of this Undertaking till the completion of the Proposed Transaction or as the case may be, till the time the Government decide not to proceed with the Proposed Transaction, whether pursuant to Clauses 8 or 9 or 11, or the Bidder and / or Consortium Members decide to withdraw from the Transaction, whichever is earlier, the Receiving Party shall not, directly or indirectly, buy, sell, negotiate, or enter into any arrangements for the purchase and / or sale of any of the shares of the Company, or advise any other person directly or indirectly to buy, sell, negotiate or enter into any arrangements for purchase and / or sell any of the shares of the Company. 14. The Bidder understands, acknowledges, and agrees that the Government, the Advisors, and the Company retain the right to determine, in their sole discretion, the information that they wish to make available to the Receiving Party and the personnel through whom the same will be made available. Further, nothing in this Undertaking shall amount to or be construed as the Disclosing Party making any representations or warranties, express or implied, as to the accuracy and / or completeness of the Confidential Information and the Disclosing Party shall have no liability whatsoever to the Receiving Party resulting from the Bidder's use of the Confidential Information. The Bidder also agrees that if it determines to proceed with the Transaction, its determination will be based solely on the terms of the definitive agreements as well as on its own investigation, analysis and assessment of its investment and the Transaction. Moreover, unless and until such agreements are entered into, neither the Government nor the Bidder will be under any legal obligation of any kind with respect to the Transaction except for the matters specifically agreed to in this Undertaking or in another written and duly executed definitive agreement. 15. The Bidder hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold the Advisors, the Government and the Company indemnified and harmless from all and any damages, losses, costs, or liabilities (including legal fees and the cost of enforcing this indemnity) arising out of or resulting from any unauthorized use or disclosure by the Receiving Party of the Confidential Information or other violation of this Undertaking (notwithstanding that a Receiving Party may not be party to this Undertaking) or of any similar undertaking or agreement. In addition, because an award of money damages (whether pursuant to the foregoing sentence or otherwise) would be inadequate for any breach of this Undertaking or any similar undertaking or agreement by the Receiving Party and any such breach would cause the Disclosing Party irreparable harm, the Bidder also agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Undertaking or such similar undertaking or agreement, the Advisors, the Government or the Company Preliminary Information Memorandum PwC Page 136 of 147 will also be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. Such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Undertaking but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Advisors, the Government and / or the Company. 16. The Bidder understands, acknowledges, confirms, and agrees that each of the Government, the Company and the Advisors are beneficiaries under this Undertaking. The Bidder further agrees and confirms that each of the Government, the Company, and the Advisors, will be entitled to and may enforce, either individually or jointly, the obligations imposed on the Receiving Party under this Undertaking. 17. The Bidder agrees that no failure or delay by the Advisors / the Government / the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power, or privilege hereto. 18. The terms of this Undertaking may be varied only with the Company's and the Government's prior written agreement. This Undertaking shall be effective as of the date first above given on the first page of this Undertaking. 19.

Preliminary Information Memorandum PwC Page 144 of 147 DIPAM guidelines for employees bids No. 4/38/2002/DD-II Government of India Ministry of Disinvestment Block No.14, CGO Complex, Lodi Road, New Delhi. Dated: 25th April, 2003 OFFICE MEMORANDUM Subject: - Guidelines for management-employee bids in strategic sale. Employee participation and protection of employee interests is a key concern of the disinvestment process. The practice of reserving a portion of the equity to be disinvested for allocation to employees, at concessional prices, has been adopted in a number of cases. It is necessary and expedient to evolve and lay down guidelines to encourage and facilitate management-employee participation in the strategic sales and thus to acquire controlling stakes and manage disinvested public sector undertakings. The undersigned is directed to state that Government has, therefore, decided to lay down the following guidelines for evaluating employee / management bids: - i. The term 'employee' will include all permanent employees of a PSU and the whole-time directors on the board of the PSU. A bid submitted by employees or a body of employees will be called an \"employee bid\". ii. At least 15% of the total number of the employees in a PSU or 200 employees, whichever is lower, should participate in the bid. iii. An employee bid would be exempted from any minimum turn over criterion but will be required to qualify in terms of the prescribed net worth criterion. They will be required to follow the procedures prescribed for participation by Interested Parties in the process of strategic sale including, but not limited to, filing the expression of interest along with all details, as applicable to other investors, furnishing of bank guarantee for payment of the purchase price etc. iv. Employees can either bid directly and independently or, for the purpose of meeting the financial criteria like net worth, can form a consortium or bid through a JV or a SPV, along with a bank, venture capitalist or a financial institution. However, employees will not be permitted to form consortia with other companies. v. If the bidding entity of the employees is a consortium, JV or SPV, employees must have a controlling stake and be in control of the bidding entity. vi. If the bid is submitted through a consortium, JV or SPV, employees must contribute at least 10% of the financial bid. vii. If the employees form a consortium, the consortium partners would be prohibited from submitting individual bids independently. viii. If it is not the highest bid, the employee bid shall be considered only if the said bid is within 10% of the highest bid. ix. The employee bid shall, subject to fulfilling the conditions above, have the first option for acquiring the shares under offer provided they match the highest bid and the highest bid being equal to or more than the reserve price. x. If the employee bid is not the highest bid and there are more than one employee bids within the 10% band, the highest of the employee bids will have precedence for purchase at the highest bid. If such employee bidder is unwilling or unable to match the highest bid, the option will pass on to the next highest employee bid and so on till all the employee bids, within the 10% band, are exhausted. xi. In the event of no employee bidder, within the 10% band, being willing or able to match the highest bid, the shares under offer will be sold to the highest bidding entity. Preliminary Information Memorandum PwC Page 145 of 147 xii. There will be a lock-in period of three years for the shares disinvested by the Government. All the bidders for the management-employee buy-outs will also have to satisfy the provisions of the 'Guidelines for qualification of bidders seeking to acquire stakes in Public sector Enterprise through the process of disinvestment' issued vide the then Department of Disinvestment's Office Memorandum No.6/4/2001-DD-II dated 13th July 2001 or as amended subsequently along with other qualification criterion as generally applicable and not specifically excluded herein.
