Yesterday, it has been reported that he lost the Tory whip, i.e. he was expelled from the Tory party. The reason for this step is that he had taken to social media and claimed the Covid vaccine to be the \"biggest crime against humanity since the holocaust\". The North West Leicestershire MP has been vocal in remarks questioning the coronavirus vaccine. On Wednesday he shared an article on vaccines on Twitter, adding: \"As one consultant cardiologist said to me, this is the biggest crime against humanity since the Holocaust.\" Renouncing Bridgen's right to sit as a Tory MP in Parliament, Conservative chief whip Simon Hart said: \"Andrew Bridgen has crossed a line, causing great offence in the process. \"As a nation, we should be very proud of what has been achieved through the vaccine programme. The vaccine is the best defence against Covid that we have. [ \"Misinformation about the vaccine causes harm and costs lives. I am therefore removing the whip from Andrew Bridgen with immediate effect, pending a formal investigation.\"](https://edzardernst.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/422290-1.webp) Earlier, former Cabinet minister Simon Clarke had condemned his colleague's tweet referencing the Holocaust, calling it \"disgraceful\". Bridgen is currently already suspended from the Commons after he was found to have displayed a \"very cavalier\" attitude to the rules in a series of lobbying breaches. MPs agreed on Monday to suspend the North West Leicestershire MP for five sitting days from Tuesday. [Comments from different sources](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/11/tory-mp-andrew-bridgen-loses-whip-over-covid-vaccine-comments) are not flattering for Bridgen: - Karen Pollock, the chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said Bridgen's tweet was \"highly irresponsible, wholly inappropriate and an elected politician should know better\". - Anneliese Dodds, the Labour chair, said: \"Andrew Bridgen has been spreading dangerous misinformation on Covid vaccines for some time now. He could have been disciplined weeks ago. \"To invoke the Holocaust, as he did today, is utterly shameful, but it should never have reached this point.\" - Andrew Percy, the Conservative MP who is vice-chair of the all-party group against antisemitism, called the comment \"disgusting\". Asked by Times Radio if Bridgen should be allowed to stand again, Percy said: \"I don't think anybody who believes this kind of crap should, but that's a matter for the whips not for me.\" - John Mann, the former Labour MP who is now a non-affiliated peer and the government's independent adviser on antisemitism, said Bridgen should not be allowed to stand again as a Tory. \"There is no possibility that Bridgen can be allowed to stand at the next election,\" he said. \"He cannot claim that he didn't realise the level of offence that his remarks cause.\" ____________________________ To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that a UK politician has been punished in this way. But it may well be also the first time that a sitting UK politician has uttered such insane stupidity. Bridgen's chronic ineptitude is all the more significant as he really should know better. He studied genetics and behaviour at the University of Nottingham and graduated with a degree in biological sciences! Here are some reactions from people commenting on Twitter about the twit: - Tory MP, Andrew Bridgen highlights... - Lies in court over family dispute and ordered by judge to pay \u00a3800k - Suspended for breaching MP lobbying rules - Thought all Brits entitled to Irish passport after Brexit - Likens vaccines to holocaust What a guy. - Spreads a dangerous, baseless smear his party colluded in a vaccine Holocaust and at the same time manages to insults victims of a grotesque wartime Holocaust. Conspiracy theorist Andrew Bridgen's lost the plot. See no way back for the Tory MP now. - Grubby and despicable: Tory MP Andrew Bridgen loses whip over 'dangerous' Covid vaccine claims - To be fair, Bridgen kept the whip after saying the MI5 knew about the pandemic six months early, then colluded with shadowy elites to impose needless restrictions for their own nefarious ends. So the bar is high. - Politicians like Andrew Bridgen have succeeded in bringing conspiracy theories into the mainstream. They need to be called out, their arguments dismantled and their political influence cast out to the fringes where it belongs. - A Holocaust survivor has condemned a Tory MP's \"mind-boggling ignorance\" after he compared the mass genocide of Jewish people during World War II to the COVID vaccine rollout - Many congratulations to Andrew Bridgen on his imminent selection as the Reform Party candidate for North West Leicestershire in the 2024 election - Andrew Bridgen. Perjury, bullying, misuse of money, months of anti-vaccine garbage, finally loses whip after comparing vaccination to the Holocaust. Scum. - Six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. COVID vaccines have saved millions. The false and outrageous comparisons must end. - Andrew Bridgen suspended as Tory MP he said: \"As one consultant cardiologist said to me, this is the biggest crime against humanity since the Holocaust.\" Crucially a cardiologist saying this too. Who are they? Should GMC act in same way as Whips Office? The prime candidate for the cardiologist in question must, of course, be [Aseem Malhotra](https://edzardernst.com/2022/01/dr-aseem-malhotra-and-dr-steven-james-candour-and-complacency/) who also appeared on September 27, 2022, in a [press conference](https://perma.cc/6SSF-ZZ3T) with the [World Council for Health](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7nqm7/mysterious-medical-organizations-are-calling-for-an-end-to-covid-vaccines) \u2014 a group that has previously spread vaccine misinformation \u2014 to call for the \"immediate and complete suspension of Covid-19 vaccine.\" Who was it that coined the bon mot: We were all born ignorant but to remain so requires hard work "}
