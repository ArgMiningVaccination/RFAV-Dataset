Traditionally, depression is treated using a combination of therapy and medication. However, seeking complementary options is beneficial, especially for those who suffer from treatment-resistant depression or are interested in natural remedies. What Is Depression? [Depression](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/depression/) is a mood disorder characterized by a wide range of symptoms that may be mild, moderate, or severe. Symptoms deeply impact an individual, making it difficult for them to navigate life. In the United States, depression is the leading cause of disability in those between the age of 15 and 44, and affects one in every ten people.1 It's important to recognize that [depression is different from sadness](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/depression-vs-sadness/). Whereas depression is a persistent mental health condition, [sadness](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/sadness/) is an emotion that everyone will experience at some point in their life.

How an individual wants to pursue treatment is very personal, and treating depression may look different for everyone. Before pursuing alternative treatments, it is important to consider traditional methods, too. For example, participating in psychotherapy alongside complementary therapy approaches is one option. The combination of the two can be even more beneficial than utilizing one or the other on their own. Below are nine alternative treatments for depression: 1. St John's Wort [St John's wort](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/st-johns-wort/) is an herb that is commonly taken as a supplement for depression.3 It may be helpful for those who experience mild to moderate symptoms, but is not intended to treat major to severe depression.3 St John's wort comes in different forms, and is believed to positively affect serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine levels in the brain.3 2. Physical Exercise Not only does it help one feel better physically, but [exercise is also beneficial for one's mental health](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/exercise-mental-health/). When starting a new exercise routine, consider scheduling a set time and day for weekly activity-this way, you're more likely to make it a habit. Physical exercise does not have to include going to a gym. You could choose instead to go for a walk, bike, or even engage in [ecotherapy](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/ecotherapy/) or [adventure therapy](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/adventure-therapy/).

Because this approach utilizes physical activity as its key component, walk and talk therapy provides the same benefits of exercise for clients. 7.

Acupuncture Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine that is believed to aid in rebalancing one's energy flow, thus improving their health.9 Thin steel needles are inserted into specific areas of one's body, with each location depending on the health issue being treated.9 In one study, findings found that acupuncture resulted in similar effects to that of an antidepressant in participants.9 Potential Risks of Alternative Treatments for Depression It is always recommended to seek medical advice from your provider before seeking any form of treatment, whether this includes taking a supplement or engaging in physical activity. A doctor will take your physical health into account when helping you understand any possible risks associated with a treatment approach. Individuals should consider alternative treatments for depression with caution if they are: - Pregnant or may become pregnant - Breastfeeding - Experiencing a pre-existing medical condition - Taking other medications or supplements - Children or elderly Are Alternative Treatments for Depression Effective? Some alternative treatments appear to be more effective than others, but research is often mixed. For example, numerous studies show a positive correlation between physical exercise and the improvement of depressive symptoms. Other research suggests that St. John's wort may be effective in treating mild to moderate depression, while findings are mixed regarding the efficacy of acupuncture.3,8,9 As mentioned, it is always encouraged to speak with a medical professional before pursuing a new supplement or treatment method. A variety of complementary approaches can easily be added into your treatment plan after confirming it is safe to do so. Any treatment method will not work the same way for everyone, so it may take some trial and error to identify what best suits your needs. In My Experience My thoughts on alternative therapies remain open. I believe that it is important to consider your own symptoms and lifestyle before choosing the approaches that are best for you. Psychotherapy is a powerful tool in the treatment of depression, but I also feel that it is important to implement positive activities in between sessions-such as the methods addressed in this article. Yoga, meditation, physical exercise, and developing healthy coping skills are highly effective alternative options that I encourage my own clients to practice. "}
