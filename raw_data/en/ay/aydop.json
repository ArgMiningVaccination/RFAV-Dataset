ETH - 1-8. The Complaint goes on to allege violations of the I.R.S. tax code and other undefined illegal electioneering activities. Id. Vaccinate Your Family is a non -profit organization based in Washington D.C. The organization was founded in 1991 by Former First Lady Rosalynn Carter an d its stated primary mission is to protect people of all ages from vaccine preventable diseases . Vaccinate Your Family spent $20,000 on the digital ads complained of by Yes on 1, which linked to a page on the organization's website that discussed the history of vaccines in Maine. ETH - 14-21. On February 25, 2020, Commission staff responded to Yes on 1 that under 94-270 C.M.R. Ch. 1 \u00a7 4(2)(C), the Complaint must set forth facts with sufficient details as are necessary to specify an allegation of Maine's campaign finance law. ETH - 9-10. The staff's letter explains that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over I.R.S. violations and that most of the Complaint does not set forth sufficient facts for the Commission to investigate. Id. The one alleg ation with sufficient facts is whether or not Vaccinate Your Family was required to include a paid -for disclaimer on the advertisements under 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1055- A. Id. Commission Meeting 06/24/2020 Agenda Item #32 On April 30, 2020, Vaccinate Y our Family provided its initial response to the Commission staff's April 13, 2020 letter. ETH - 14-21. Vaccinate Your Family provided two (2) invoices paid to MiQ Digital USA, Inc. to run the digital advertisements ,1 totaling $20,000. Id. These advertisements read \"Keep Maine's Children Safe from M easles\" and \"Maine's children are at risk of diseases. Keep them safe.\" These advertisements link to the Vaccinate Your Family's webpage in Maine. Id. All webpages on Vaccinate Your Family contains the following information: Vaccinate Your Family 1012 14th Street NW, Suite 415 Washington, DC 20005 Disclaimer: The Vaccinate Your Family website contains links to external sites and resources. We are not responsible for the accuracy or content of those external sites or resources. 202-783-7034 202-783-7042 info@vaccinateyourfamily.org ETH - 71-72. After considering the initial response by Vaccinate Your Family, the Commission staff sent additional correspondence inquiring into whether Vaccinate Your Family could qualify as a ballot question committee (\"BQC\"). ETH - 22-62. On June 10, 2020, Vaccinate Your Family provided its follow-up response to the Commission staff's May 29, 2020 letter. ETH - 63-66. Vaccinate Your Family agrees that they qualify as a person under Maine law and spent more than $5,000, but disputes that the purpose of the expenditure was to influence an election. Id. The advertisements and Maine specific webpage do not include a position on LD 798 or the people's veto and \"simply provid[es] information consistent with the core mission of the organization.\" Id. 1 The invoices are itemized by \"Influencers,\" \"Contextual,\" and \"CAST.\" These terms represent different computer algorithms t hat target a specific type of audience and di splay the advertisements for that audience. For example: the algorithm could target Maine residents between the ages of 25 and 35 and display the advertisements to individuals who fit that description . Commission staff does not know the criteria used by Vaccinate Your Family. 3 LEGAL REQUIREMENTS The Standard for Opening a Requested Investigation The Election Law authorizes the Commission to receive requests for investigation and to conduct an investigation \"if the reasons stated for the request show sufficient grounds for believing that a violation may have occurred.\" A person may apply in writing to the commission requesting an investigation as described in subsection 1. The commission shall review the application and shall make the investigation if the reasons stated for the request show sufficient grounds for believing that a violation may have occurred. 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1003(2). Definition of a BQC A person, not defined as a political action committee , that receives contributions or makes expenditures aggregating in excess of $5,000 for the purpose of initiating or influencing a campaign shall register as a ballot question committee and file reports with the commission . 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1056- B. The Commission interprets this to include communications and activities which expressly advocate for or against a ballot question or which clearly identify a ballot question by apparent and unambiguous reference and are susceptible of no reasonable interpretation o ther than to promote or oppose the ballot question. Guidance on Reporting as a Ballot Question Committee (June 30, 2008). Definition of Expenditure The term \"expenditure\" includes: (1) A purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit or gift of money or anything of value made for the purpose of initiating or influencing a campaign; (2) a contract, promise, or agreement, expressed or implied, whether or not legally enforceable, to make any expenditure for the purposes set for this in this paragraph; and (3) the transfer of funds by a political action committee or another candidate or political committee; but, does not fall within one of the outlined exceptions. 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1052(4). 4 Definition of Influence To promote, support or oppose or defeat. Express Advocacy In the context of a ballot question election, the Commission staff recommends interpreting \"expressly advocate\" to refer to that are \"susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a clearly identified candidate.\" See 94-270 C.M.R. Ch. 1 \u00a7 10(2)(B) (defining \"expressly advocate\" in the context of a candidate election). Political Communications to Influence a Ballot Question When a person makes an expenditure exceeding $500 to expressly advocate through a publicly accessible site on the internet, the communication must clearly and conspicuously state the name and address of the person who financed the communication s, unless the name or address would be so small as to be illegible or infeasible . 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1055- A. DISCUSSION AND STAFF RECOMMENDATION Alleged Disclaimer Violation Commission staff recommends that the Commission find that Vaccinate Your Family did not violate 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1055-A. In viewing the two advertisements by themselves, neither reference L.D. 798 or the people's veto effort. ETH - 3, 8. The language also does not contain any key express advocacy terms, such as \"vote no\" or \"oppose.\" The messages themselves (\"Keep Maine's Children Safe from Measles\" and \"Maine's children are at risk of diseases. Keep them safe\") are reasonably susceptible to non - election com munications consistent with Vaccinate Your Family's general purpose, to protect all ages from preventable diseases. Id. Additionally, even if the Commission found that the advertisements themselves contained express advocacy, the Commission should consider whether the inclusion of the name and address would be impractical due to size or character limitations. Vaccinate Your 5 Family's advertisements are not large banner ads that are displayed at the top of a website, nor are they large sidebar advertise ments; comparatively, the advertisements are relatively small block s. It is important to understand that digital advertisements are designed to be displayed across multiple types of devices. For instance, an ad on a phone will be displayed more prominently than one on a computer, but it is the same advertisement. Compare ETH - 3, 8. The Commission should consider the practicality of requiring these inclusions when the ad is viewed from a computer, rather than a phone or tablet because that is generally the most accurate representation of the size of the advertisement relative to the space. The Commission staff believes that the Commission could reasonably decide either way on whether the advertisements meet the exception under 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1055- A(2). Alternatively, if the Commission chooses to view the advertisements , not in a vacuum and to also consider the Vaccinate Your Family's website, then the Commission should also find no violation of 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1055-A. At the bottom of the webpage that t he advertisements link to is the organization 's name and address. ETH - 5. In viewing the webpage and the advertisements together, Vaccinate Your Family complied with the disclaimer requirement. Finally, if the Commission were to find that Vaccinate Y our Family violated 21- A M.R.S. \u00a7 1055-A, the Commission could impose a penalty of not more than $5,000. Id. at (3). The advertisements were widespread, having over 3 million impressions2. Commission staff does not believe that the violation was intentional; Vaccinate Your Family is a national organization and has had limited interactions with Maine campaign finance laws. It does not appear that the violation occurred as the result of an error by a printer or other paid vendor. The communications in no way concealed the identity of the organization. In conclusion, it is the recommendation of Commission staff that the Commission find that Vaccinate Your Family did not violate 21- A M.R.S. \u00a7 1055- A for the reasons stated 2 An impression is when the ad is displayed on a website to a person. It is likely that one person would receive multiple impressions. 6 above. If the Commission were to find a violation, staff would recommend a financial penalty of $2,000, or 10% of the total cost of the advertisements. In making this recommendation, staff considered the high number of impressions, limited experience of the organization with Maine campaign finance law, and that the communications did not conceal the identity of the organization. BQC Registration Requirement Whether Vaccinate Your Family qualifies as a BQC is an issue raised by staff after receiving their initial response to the Complaint filed by Yes on 1. There is no dispute that Vaccinate Your Family qualifies as a person and spent more than $5,000. Accordingly , the only issue for the Commission to address is whether the expenditures were to influence an election. After reviewing Vaccinate Your Family's response, it is the recommendation of Commission staff that Vaccinate Your Family is not required to register as a BQC. 3 For Vaccinate Your Family to qualify as a BQC, the $20,000 expenditure must have been made to influence an election. 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1056- B. The term influence includes \"communications and activities which expressly advocate for or against a ballot question or which clearly identify a ballot question by apparent and unambiguous reference and are susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than to promote or oppose the ballot question.\" Guidance on Reporting as a Ballot Question Committee (June 30, 2008). The term \"express advocacy\" is not defined in the context of ballot questions but this language is modeled after 94- 270 C.M.R. Ch. 1 \u00a7 10(2)(B) (defining \"expressly advocate\" in the context of a candidate election). The advertisements by themselve s very clearly do not contain express advocacy. They do not clearly identify a ballot question and do not contain phrases or slogans that would usually be interpreted to be express advocacy. ETH - 3, 8. Accordingly, if the Commission views the advertisements in a vacuum then the 3 Vaccinate Your Family, as a national organization, does not qualify as a PAC because its major purpose is not to influence Maine elections. 21 -A M.R.S. \u00a7 1052(5)(A)(4). 7 advertisements do not contain express advocacy and Vaccinate Your Family presumably did not spend any funds to put up the webpage; therefore, Vaccinate Your Family does not qualify as a BQC. Likewise, if the Commission views the webpage and the advertisements collectively then the Commission should still find that Vaccinate Your Family does not qualify as a BQC. The webpage and the advertisements still do not contain phrases or slogans that would usually be interpreted to be express advocacy. ETH - 3, 8, 71-72. The webpage clearly identifies a ballot question. The issue before the Commission is whether the language is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than to promote or oppose the ballot question. In reviewing Vaccinate Your Family's activities, Commission staff believes that the advertisements and webpage are reasonably susceptible to interpretations other than to promote or oppose the ballot question. Vaccinate Your Family publishes the \"State of the Immunion\" annually, which discusses current national outbreaks, and solutions to those outbreaks. ETH - 73-96. The organization also routinely publishes updates for outbreaks nationally and solutions to resolve those outbreaks. While Commission staff cannot locate another instance of these updates referencing a referendum, the advertisements and webpage appear wholly consistent with the organization's approach to raise awareness of outbreaks and discuss targeted solutions to resolve those outbreaks. Additionally, Vaccinate Your Family had limited interactions in this election. The organization ran $20,000 worth of digital advertisements, publ ished a webpage at no additional cost, and made an in-kind contribution of $45,000 to a registered committee. For reference, the two committees registered to oppose the referendum spent approximately $667,000 on the election. Seventy- three percent (73%) of voters voted against the referendum. Commission staff does not suggest that $20,000 is minimal financial activity. However, if the true purpose of Vaccinate Your Family was to influence an election, staff would expect to see additional activity and more coordination with the registered committees. 8 The absence of additional election -related activity and the consistent approach to disseminate information to regions with outbreaks of diseases strongly indicates to Commission staff that there is a reaso nable non- campaign related purpose to these expenditures. Conversely, if the Commission finds that the communications contained express advocacy and that Vaccinate Your Family is required to register as a BQC, the Commission could impose a penalty of up to $2,500. 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1062-A(1). In assessing a fine, the Commission shall consider whether the violation was intentional, the amount of campaign and financial activity that occurred before registration, whether the committee intended to conceal its activity and the level of experience of the committee's staff. Id. Commission staff does not believe that the violation was intentional. The unreported amount of activity is $20,000. Vaccinate Your Family did not conceal its activity and it's officers had limited experience with Maine campaign finance laws. Commission staff recommends that the Commission find that Vaccinate Your Family is not required to register as a BQC for the reasons stated above. If the Commission finds that Vaccinate Your Fami ly is required to register as a BQC, Commission staff recommends a $2,000 (10% of the unreported financial activity) penalty for the late registration.

Box 5688 Augusta, ME 04332 Re: Complaint against Vaccinate Your Family Dear Ms. Sacks: The staff of the Maine Ethics Commission has conferred with the Commission's Chair and Counsel concerning your letter emailed on February 19, 2020 requesting an investigation of Vaccinate Your Family . Under 94 -270 C.M.R. ch.1 \u00a7 4(2)(C), a complaint must s et forth facts with sufficient details as are necessary to specify an allegation of Maine's campaign finance law . All allegations must be based on personal knowledge or must identify the source of the information which is the basis for the request so that respondents and the Commission staff may adequately respond to the request. Id. In reviewing your complaint, the only alleged violation that appears to meet this standard is whether Vaccinate Your Family has failed to include the name and address of the person who financed the communication pursuant to 21 -A M.R.S. \u00a7 1055 -A. For a violation to occur, the ad expenditure must exceed $500 and the ad must expressly advocate for or against a referendum. Id.; see also, e.g., 94-270 C.M.R. ch. 1 \u00a7 12(10). In the opinion of the Commission staff , neither banner ad in the screenshots attached to your complaint appears to expressly advocate for or against a referendum . As you have indicated in your complaint, clicking on the ad s takes the user to a webpage that clearly references the referendum . In viewing that page , however, the name and address of Vaccinate Your Family are displayed at the bottom of the page. Therefore, even if the cost of that single webpage on Vaccinate Your Family's website was over $500 and contained express advocacy, it would appear to be compliant with the requirement in the staff's view . It is not clear if you are asking t he Commission to investigate whether Vaccinate Your Family is violating I.R.S. regulations as a 501 (c)(3) organization . However, the Commission does not have jurisdiction to consider matters involving federal tax law. The complaint does not set forth any facts supporting an allegation of \"illegal campaign expenditures\" with sufficient details to allow respondents or Commission staff to respond. Other than the questions relating to the digital ads, t he questions listed under \"Questions We Have\" also do not provide any facts with sufficient details alleging a specific violation that would allow respondents or the Commission staff to respond. ETH - 9 2 Under 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1002(1), the Commission shall meet within two business days of the filing of a complaint, unless the Commission Chair determines that the complaint involves allegations of minor violations, such as omitted disclaimer statements on campaign communications. The Commission Chair has been informed about your complaint and determined that it involves a minor violation and has deferred your complaint until after the election. The Commission will schedule your complaint regarding whether a violation of 21 -A M.R.S. \u00a7 1055 -A occurred at its April 29, 2020 meeting. If at some time in the future, you obtain additional facts for the Commission's consideration you may refile the matter for review.

The Commission staff considers this complaint to be a request to conduct an investigation pursuant to 21 -A M.R.S. \u00a7 1003. This letter is to provide Vaccinate Your Family with an opportunity to respond to the request for investigation and to provide any factual information or legal argument that it believes is relevant. At its public meeting on May 27, 2020, the Commission will consider : (1) whether to conduct a formal investigation , and (2) whether, after receiving preliminary information from the parties, a final decision can be made. Potential Scope of Investigation The scope of any investigation will be determined by the Commission. An investigation could include the following issues: Whether Vaccinate Your Family spent more than $500 on advertisements that expressly advocated for or against the people's veto of LD 798. Whether those advertisements failed to include the name and address of the person who financed the advertisement; and if so, whether there were mitigating factors for that failure. Whether Vaccinate Your Family made any other expenditures or received any contributions for the purpose of campaigning for or against the people's veto of LD 798. ETH - 11Amy Pisani Page 2 June 15, 2020 2 Relevant Law Standard for Initiating an Investigation The Commission is required to review every request to investigate an alleged violation of campaign finance law and to conduct an \"investigation if the reasons stated for the request show sufficient grounds for believing that a violation may have occurred.\" (21-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1003(2)). Definition of Expenditure. The term \"e xpenditure\" includes: (1) A purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit or gift of money or anything of value made for the purpose of initiating or influencing a campaign; (2) a contract, promise, or agreement, expressed or implied, whether or not legally enforceable, to make any expenditure for the purposes set for this in this paragraph; and (3) the transfer of funds by a political action committee or another candidate or political committee; but, does not fall within one of the outlined excep tions. 21- A M.R.S. \u00a7 1052(4). Political communications to influence a ballot question. When a person, including an organization, makes an expenditure over $500 to expressly advocate for or against an initiative or referendum that is on the ballot, the communication must clearly and conspicuously state the name and address of the person who financed the communication. If the name or address would be so small as to be illegible or infeasible because of size or character limitations, then the name and ad dress of the financer do not need to be included on the communication. A violation of this section may result in a penalty of no more than $5,000. In assessing the penalty, the Commission shall consider, among other things: (1) how widely the communicati on was disseminated, (2) whether the violation was intention, (3) whether the violation occurred as the result of an error by a third party vendor, (4) whether the communication conceals or misrepresents the identity of the person who financed it. 21- A M.R.S. \u00a7 1055 -A. Express Advocacy. In the context of a ballot question election, the Commission staff recommends interpreting \"expressly advocate\" to refer to that are \"susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a clearly identified candidate.\" See 94-270 C.M.R. ch. 1 \u00a7 10(2)(B) (defining in of a candidate election) .

You are welcome to submit any factual information or legal argument you believe would be relevant to the Commission's decision whether to investigate. In addition, please address the following points: How much did Vaccinate Your Family pay for the advertisements referenced in the complaint? When did the payments occur? Has Vaccinate Your Family paid for any additional public communications that reference vaccination of Maine residents?

Most organizations that raise or spend money to influence a ballot question in Maine form a political action committee (PAC) for that purpose, and file regular PAC reports with the Commission. Some advocacy, charitable, or other organizations do not qualify as PACs under the Election Law, but they are interested in rais ing and spending money to influence a ballot question. In 2000, the Maine Legislature enacted 21- A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1056- B to create a reporting requirement for these non-PAC organizations. The Election Law designates these organizations as \"ballot question c ommittees \" (BQC s) and they are required to register with the Commission. Under these requirements , [a]ny person not defined as a political action committee who solicits and receives contributions or makes expenditures, other than by contribution to a political action committee or ballot question committee, aggregating in excess o f $5,000 for the purpose of initiating or influencing a campaign ... shall register as a ballot question committee and file reports with the commission in accordance with this section. The complete language of 21-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1056-B and the definition of \"campaign\" attached to this memo. Does the requirement apply only to individuals? No. Under Maine Election law, the term \"person\" includes individual s, committee s, firms, partnerships , corporations, associations, or organizations. When do es a ballot qu estion c ommittee have to register with the Commission? Within seven days of receiving contributions or making expenditures to initiate or influence a campaign that exceed $5,000, a ballot question committee must register with the Commission. ETH - 24 2 How do es a ballot question committee register with the Commission and file financial reports? The committee must register and file the initial campaign finance report using the Commission's e -filing website . The committee may also use the Commission's paper forms available for download on the Commission's website. After registering, the committee must file all other campaign finance reports electronically . What contributions must be reported by a ballot question committee ? Section 1056- B covers \"contributions [r eceived] for the purpose of initiating or influencing a [ ballot question] ....\" This includes : funds that the contributor specified were given in connection with a ballot question; funds provided in response to a solicitation that would lead the contributor to believe that the funds would be used specifically for the purpose of initiating or influencing a ballot question; funds that can reasonably be determined to have been provided by the contributor for the purpose of initiating or influencing a ballo t question when viewed in the context of the contribution and the recipient's activities regarding a ballot question; and funds or transfers from the general treasury of an organization filing a ballot question report . Funds provided in response to a sol icitation that would lead the contributor to believe that the funds would be used to support an organization's general activities, rather than activities relating to a ballot question, do not need to be reported. A ballot question committee must report but is not required to itemize contributions from a single source that aggregate $50 or less. What expenditures must be reported by a ballot question committee ? Section 1056- B covers expenditures for communications and activities made \"for the purpose of i nitiating or influencing a [ballot question] .\" The Commission interprets this to include communications and activities which expressly advocate for or against a ballot question or which clearly identify a ballot question by apparent and unambiguous reference and are susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than to promote or oppose the ballot question. Expenditures to be reported include: expenditures for communications to voters for the purpose of promoting or opposing a ballot question, including advertising on television, radio, and print media; literature that is mailed or distributed by hand to voters; automated ETH - 25 3 telephone calls and scripted calls from live callers; signs, bumper stickers, and other forms of outdoor advertising; staff time promoting or opposing the ballot question at public or press events; staff time canvassing (conducting door -to-door visits to) voters; travel expenses paid to employees or volunteers who are conducting activities to promote or oppose a ballot question; staff time preparing presentations, testimony, letters to the editor, opinion pieces, articles for publication, or press releases to promote or oppose a ballot question; research or analysis, including written reports and legal opinions, where the organi zation knows or reasonably should know that the results will be used to promote or oppose a ballot question and where the results are used for that purpose; and expenditures to distribute research or technical analysis regarding a ballot question for the purpose of encouraging voters to vote yes, or no, on the question. This list is not intended to be exhaustive and is similar to the types of expenditures reported by political action committees to promote or defeat a ballot question. What expenditures a re not covered by \u00a7 1056-B? The Commission interprets \u00a7 1056- B as excluding expenditures for communications or activities that do not clearly identify a ballot question by apparent and unambiguous reference. In addition, expenditures made merely to educate voters or others about a ballot question in a neutral way are not covered by \u00a7 1056- B, even if a ballot question is clearly identified. These would include expenditures for : hosting a meeting at which advocates or members of the public are invited to present their views on the ballot question, provided that the sponsors of the event make reasonable efforts to ensure that the forum is balanced; distributing news stories, commentary, or editorials concerning a ballot question through the facilities of a broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication, unless the facilities are owned or controlled by persons otherwise engaged in other advocacy activities to promote or oppose the ballot question; and research or analysis concerning a ballot question paid by an entity which is not otherwise participating in the ballot question campaign, provided that the ETH - 26 4 research or analysis does not clearly express support for or opposition to the ballot question or urge others to vote for or against the ballot question. Do \"expenditures [made] ... for the purpose of initiating ... a [ ballot question]\" include payments to staff o r other expenses incurred in drafting legislation intended as a direct initiative ? Yes. If an organization pays its employees (or incurs other expenses) to draft legislation that the organization intends will be submitted to the Secretary of State as a direct initiative (even if submitted by a different organization or individuals ), those expenses should be counted as expenditures made to initiate a ballot question. What about expenditures to circulate ballot question petitions to collect signatures, and other expenses of advocates for and against a ballot question during the signature -gathering phase ? In 2006, the Legislature amended the term \"expenditure\" to clarify that payments of money to collect signatures for a ballot question must be reported. The Commission interprets the \"expenditures [made] ... for the purpose of ... influencing \" includes payments made by opponents o f the ballot question during the time period in which proponents may gather petition signatures. Are donors required to register and file reports as a BQC? If an individual or organization makes contributions to a PAC or BQC, those contributions do not count toward the threshold of making expenditures that total more than $5,000 to initiate or influence a campaign. Consequently, if an individual's or organization's only financial activity to initiate or influence a ballot question is to make a contribut ion to a PAC or BQC, that individual or organization would not need to register and file campaign finance reports as a BQC. That is to say, if an individual or organization uses their own funds to make the contribution, the contribution is not counted tow ards the $5,000 threshold. What if an individual or organization raises money to give to a PAC or BQC? If an individual or organization receives funds for the purpose of influencing a ballot question, and gives those funds to a PAC or BQC , the funds received by the individual or organization count towards the $5,000 threshold. For example, if a trade association solicits funds from its members in order to make a contribution to a PAC or BQC involved in a ballot question, the trade association may have to register as a ballot question committee if it raised more than $5,000. It is not the contribution to the PAC or BQC that triggers the registration requirement; it is the fund- raising activity by the trade association that triggers it. ETH - 27 5 What if an organization contributes or transfers funds to another organization which is not a PAC or BQC? A contribution or transfer of funds from one organization to another organization for the purpose of influencing a ballot question counts towards the $5,000 threshold as an expenditure made by the first organization. The other organization may also have to register as a BQC . What if an organization donates the time of its paid employees to a PAC or BQC to influenc e a ballot question or make s payments to vendors for goods or services to influence a ballot question in coordination with a PAC or BQC? Donating paid staff to a PAC or BQC , and coordinat ing expenditures with a PAC or BQC are in- kind contribut ions to the PAC or BQC . They do not count toward the $ 5,000 expenditure threshold that would trigger filing of a \u00a7 1056 -B report by the donor ; however, the PAC or BQC must report them as in- kind contributions. An organization's expenditures to influence a ballot question may be considered an in- kind contribution t o a PAC or BQC only if they are coordinated with the PAC or BQC or are accepted by a PAC or BQC . Expenditures to influence a ballot question made independently of the PAC or BQC should not be considered contributions to the PAC or BQC and would count toward the $5,000 threshold. Guidance to PACs and Contributors on the Reporting of In -Kind Contributions Some PACs and BQCs involved in ballot question campaigns have reported receiving significant in -kind contributions from other organizations , but provided little detail regarding the goods and services they received. PACs or BQCs must provide more detail about large in- kind contributions they have received. For example, if a PAC or BQC reports that it received significant paid staff time from another orga nization, it shoul d include a description of those staff activities and the number of hours of staff time that were contributed. A PAC's or BQC's reporting of coordinated spending made by a contributor should include a brief description of the goods and s ervices that were purchased and their value. Contributed staff and coordinated expenditures should not be lumped together as a single contribution for the reporting period, but should be itemized as separate contributions. Other Guidance If you have any questions, please contact the Commission's Political Committee and Lobbyist Registrar at 287- 4179 or ethics@maine.gov .

ETH - 70[Taken by Commission Staff on 06/12/2020 from https://www.vaccinateyourfamily.org/meimmunizations/ ] Keep Maine 's Children Safe from Diseases To help protect the health of all of Maine's citizens, the state has required certain immunizations for school entry since 1868. However, too many of Maine's parents have been opting their children out school vaccination requirements for non- medical reasons. As a result, Maine has one of the worst \"opt -out\" rates in the nation. This has led to dangerous outbreaks of whooping cough and chickenpox in Maine's daycare centers and schools. It also makes the state vulnerable to potentially serious outbreaks of other dangerous diseases like measles. When even a few parents refuse to vaccinate their children they put us everyone in their community at risk of dangerous diseases, including people with weakened immune systems due to chemotherapy, transplants or other health problems. Maine legislators recently passed LD 798, a law which keeps medical exemptions to school vaccination requirements, but removed \"philosophical reasons\" and \"religious belief\" exemptions. Removing these non- medical exemptions: ETH - 71 Ensures a safe learning environment for all children, including those who cannot receive immunizations and those who are at risk for vaccine -preventable diseases and serious health complications due to their weakened immune systems. Results in fewer missed school days from preventable outbreaks. Allows school administrators, school boards, and nurses to adequately protect students from preventable diseases . On March 3, Maine will put this new law to a popular vote. Learn more about this by visiting our partner's website - Maine Families for Vaccines . Learn how vaccines protect communities.

Nearly 20 years later, in 2019, the United States almost lost its measles elimination status. Across 31 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 1,282 cases of measles\u2014the highest number of cases in any year since 1992. 1 Of these individuals with measles, 128 people were hospitalized and 61 had serious complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis. 2 The fact that the majority of people in the U.S. are vaccinated against measles is the only thing that prevents these clusters of measles cases from becoming even more serious epidemics. Beyond measles, outbreaks of hepatitis A continue to occur throughout the country, with 29,804 cases, 18,143 hospitalizations and 302 deaths reported by states between 2016 and January 2020. 3 Cases of mumps, whooping cough (also known as pertussis) and hepatitis B continue to occur as well.We also continue to fall behind other countries such as Australia on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates and as a result have higher rates of cervical and five other HPV-associated cancers. Each year, HPV causes approximately 35,000 cancers in the U.S. including about 10,900 cases of cervical cancer. HPV vaccination could prevent 90% of these cancers from ever developing. 4 Meanwhile Australia, a country with much higher vaccination rates than the U.S., is on track to eliminate cervical cancer by the year 2028. 5 Unfortunately, as the decade came to a close, flu once again had a significant impact on our nation's health. By the end of 2019, the CDC estimated we had already lost between 2,900 and 7,200 people to flu, 6 including 27 children.7 That's more children than we've lost in any other year that early in the flu season. 2020: STATE OF THE IMMUNION | VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 2 ETH - 74Why are some vaccine- preventable diseases on the rise in the U.S.? And what can we do to reverse this dangerous trend? In this report, Vaccinate Your Family will examine three key areas in which Congress can help enhance our country's protection from vaccine-preventable diseases, namely: Improv ing access to vaccinations. CDC's most recent National Immunization Survey shows that children living below the poverty level and those residing in rural areas, as well as those who are on Medicaid, are less likely to be fully vaccinated by as much as 20% for some vaccines. Uninsured children are also less likely to be protected than those who are privately insured. 8 The difference is startling - over 7% of uninsured children receive no vaccines compared to less than 1% of privately insured children. 9 This is particularly concerning since the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program was authorized by Congress specifically to address disparities based on income and insurance status and provides vaccines at no cost to qualifying children whose families otherwise may not be able to afford them. There is no similar federal program for adults 19-64 years of age, nor are all CDC-recommended vaccines available at no cost to seniors on Medicare. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) does require health insurance plans to cover the cost of recommended immunizations without cost sharing, some older and more limited plans do not have to follow this law.

While the majority of parents in the U.S. ultimately choose to vaccinate their children, many have questions about immunizations. When looking up the word \"vaccine\" online, search results provide a mix of dubious websites alongside credible, science-based websites such as the CDC. Intentionally misleading information online about the safety, ingredients and effectiveness of vaccines, along with false stories about vaccine-related injuries, may lead parents and parents-to-be to decide to delay or refuse vaccinations for their family and themselves. Reminding pe ople of the dangers of vaccine-preventable diseases and their role in protecting the health of their community. Vaccines have done such a good job of reducing and eliminating infectious diseases that many people no longer remember how dangerous these diseases can be. As a result, they may not prioritize getting themselves and their family members vaccinated. When an outbreak of a disease happens in the U.S., such as measles, we often see a temporary increase in immunization rates. But, in order to avoid future outbreaks, we must help people understand the immense importance of following the recommended vaccination schedules. This report will offer solutions to help ensure the 2020s are a decade of healthy families and communities, not a roaring return of vaccine-preventable diseases. 2020: STATE OF THE IMMUNION | VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 4 ETH - 76VACCINES CAN KEEP PEOPLE Vaccines are one of the greatest public health interventions in modern times, second only to clean water. We have the ability to protect babies, children, adolescents and adults, including pregnant women, from 27 diseases.OF ALL AGES HEALTHY 2020: STATE OF THE IMMUNION | VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 5 ETH - 77Over the years, vaccines have prevented countless cases of disease and disability, and have saved millions of lives. The CDC estimates that vaccination of children born between 1994 and 2018 in the U.S. will prevent 419 million illnesses, help avoid 936,000 deaths, and save nearly $1.9 trillion in total societal costs (that includes $406 billion in direct costs). 10Vaccines help prevent infectious diseases that once killed or seriously harmed many children. Without them, children are at risk for serious illnesses such as measles, hepatitis B, whooping cough, polio and flu, which can result in disability or even death. Through timely vaccinations, we have the power to protect children from 14 dangerous diseases by the time they turn two. Without the protection offered by vaccines, people would once again have to fear these diseases. In fact, before a child is even born, we have the ability to protect them from dangerous diseases thanks to vaccination. All vaccines for infants, except for hepatitis B, start at two months of age or later, so the only protection for newborns from vaccine-preventable diseases is through vaccination of their mothers, who transfer antibodies to their babies across the placenta. These antibodies protect the infants until they can develop their own immunity through vaccination. While currently only influenza, pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus are preventable through maternal vaccination, researchers are working on the development of immunizations for many other devastating infant conditions. Maternal vaccines may soon be used to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and group B streptococcus (GBS). DID YOU KNOW? We could eliminate nearly all cervical cancers, and 5 other HPV-associated cancers, with the HPV vaccine. 4 in 5 people in the U.S. will be infected with HPV at some point.iv 32,000 OF 35,000 CASES OF HPV-ASSOCIATED CANCERS could be prevented each yearCHILDHOOD VACCINES SAVE LIVES AND MONEY III The vaccination of children born between 1994 and 2018 will prevent: 419 MILLION ILLNESSES: More than the population of the U.S. TRILLION IN TOTAL SOCIETAL COSTS: $5,000 for each person in the U.S.$1.9 936,000 DEATHS: Greater than the population of Seattle, WA 2020: STATE OF THE IMMUNION | VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 6 ETH - 78Later, as children grow into adolescents, their disease risks change. Preteens and teens are at risk of contracting certain vaccine-preventable diseases as they engage in common activities such as sharing drinks and utensils, kissing, and attending summer camps. There are now five vaccines recommended for adolescents: Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis), HPV, meningococcal ACYW, meningococcal B, and annual flu vaccines. Unfortunately, parental concerns about safety and lack of knowledge about vaccines, combined with weak provider vaccine recommendations, and fewer well visits with healthcare providers can cause this population to remain undervaccinated and thus at risk of deadly diseases both now and in the future. For example, meningococcal disease can kill 15% of people who get it, sometimes within a matter of hours, 11 while HPV can cause cervical and other HPV-associated cancers years after becoming infected with the virus. 12 Vaccine-preventable diseases also pose threats to adults. Influenza and pneumonia are together among the top ten leading causes of adult deaths in this country. 13 Low vaccination rates contribute to substantial, yet preventable, national healthcare expenses and productivity losses. The nearly $27 billion that is spent each year treating four vaccine-preventable diseases (flu, pneumococcal disease, shingles and whooping cough) in adults includes the cost of medical visits, hospitalizations and prescription coverage. 14 This does not cover the astronomical costs of absenteeism and short-term disability from work. One of every four workers is now over the age of 55. 15 The costs of addressing the health challenges within this segment of the workforce are significant, as treatments for conditions like diabetes and heart disease number in the hundreds of billions of dollars annually. 16 Many current vaccines, as well as those in development pipelines, prevent diseases that can cause dangerous illnesses, and lead to severe and sometimes deadly complications in individuals with chronic conditions. Vaccines are a proven means of preventing and reducing the inevitably huge cost of maintaining the health of our aging workforce. Immunizations have the ability to keep each person in the U.S. healthier. It is therefore vitally important that we ensure confidence in, and access to, vaccines.DID YOU KNOW?

Developing a new vaccine begins with an exploratory stage and a pre-clinical stage before advancing to three stages of clinical trials. Additionally, concomitant studies must be conducted to ensure new vaccines can be safely given with those already on the schedule. Together, this scientific process can take over a decade and cost millions of dollars. 17 The FDA then examines these studies and determines whether a vaccine is safe, effective, and ready to be licensed for use. The FDA only licenses vaccines that have data that shows that the vaccines' benefits outweigh the potential risks. If there is any question or concern about the data, the FDA will request further studies before deciding whether to approve the vaccine. 18 After a vaccine is licensed for use in the U.S., there are four systems in place that work together to help scientists monitor the safety of vaccines and identify any rare side effects that may emerge after clinical trials. These systems are critical because even large clinical trials may not be big enough to find very rare side effects. For example, some side effects may only happen in 1 in 100,000 or 1 in 500,000 people. Second, vaccine trials may not include certain populations like pregnant women or people with specific medical conditions who might have different types of side effects or who might have a higher risk of side effects than the volunteers who got the vaccine during clinical trials. These four systems are: Vac cine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS):19 VAERS is a passive reporting system. That means it relies on individuals to report vaccine reactions. Anyone can report a reaction or injury, including healthcare providers, patients and patients' representatives, such as caregivers or attorneys. The system is co-managed by the FDA and the CDC. However, it is important to note that VAERS data alone can't be used to answer the question, \"Does a certain vaccine cause a certain side effect?\" This is because adverse events (health problems) reported to VAERS may or may not be caused by vaccines. There are reports in VAERS of common conditions that occur just by chance after vaccination. Further investigation may find no medical link between vaccination and these conditions. Instead, the purpose of VAERS is to see if unexpected or unusual patterns emerge, which may indicate an issue that needs to be researched further. Vac cine Safety Datalink (VSD):20 Established in 1990, VSD is a collaboration between the CDC's Immunization Safety Office and eight healthcare organizations across the country. It conducts studies based on questions or concerns raised from the medical literature and reports to VAERS. In addition, when new vaccines are recommended or if changes are made in how a vaccine is recommended, VSD will monitor the safety of these vaccines. 2020: STATE OF THE IMMUNION | VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 9 ETH - 81 Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project (CISA):21 CISA, which was created in 2001, is a national network of vaccine safety experts from the CDC's Immunization Safety Office, seven medical research centers and other partners. CISA addresses vaccine safety issues, conducts high-quality clinical research and assesses complex clinical adverse events following vaccination. CISA also helps to connect clinicians with experts who can help consult on vaccine safety questions related to individual patients. Post -Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring System (PRISM):22 PRISM is a partnership between the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and leading health insurance plans. It actively monitors and analyzes data from a representative subset of the general population. PRISM links data from health plans with data from state and city immunization information systems (IIS). PRISM has access to information for over 190 million people, allowing it to identify and analyze rare health outcomes that would otherwise be difficult to assess. In summary, because vaccines are given to the entire population, they are one of the most scrutinized and well-tested products on the U.S. market. The systems that have been put in place to ensure their ongoing safety are expansive and have time and again proven to be effective at determining any safety signals that require further investigation.

Adults face similar challenges with additional racial and ethnic disparities. 2020: STATE OF THE IMMUNION | VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 11 ETH - 83Last year, the U.S. celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Vaccines For Children (VFC) program. VFC was first implemented in 1994 as a way to ensure all children had access to vaccines, regardless of their families' ability to pay. The program has been an enormous success. The CDC estimates that by 2018, nearly 1 million lives have been saved in the U.S. as a result of VFC. While there is no denying the success of this program, eligible families may still face obstacles in utilizing VFC. For example, some may be unaware of VFC and its benefits, while others may not realize that additional fees they may be charged for vaccine administration and office visits are not mandatory. While these fees help providers offset their costs of doing business, CDC is clear that anyone who cannot pay should not be required to do so. Unfortunately, while VFC was an important step forward, gaps in vaccine access remain. The results of CDC's most recent National Immunization Survey showed that among children two years of age and younger, there were sociodemographic disparities in coverage, especially by location and health insurance status. Children who live in rural areas as well as those who are on Medicaid are less likely to be fully vaccinated by as much as 20% for some vaccines. Uninsured children are also less likely to be protected than those who are privately insured. 23 The difference is startling: over 7% of uninsured children receive no vaccines, compared to less than 1% of privately insured children. 24 In their discussion of these findings, CDC recommends that vaccination rates for young children can be improved with increased access to healthcare providers and health insurance, and suggests providers administer all recommended vaccines during office visits to avoid missed opportunities. CDC also suggests prioritizing local-level data to assist states and communities in creating targeted interventions to prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Challenges in accessing vaccines is not limited to children. There is no program such as VFC for adults, leaving many without a means to pay for recommended vaccines. First dollar coverage of vaccines can greatly improve the likelihood that an adult will be immunized. 25 2020: STATE OF THE IMMUNION | VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 12 ETH - 84DID YOU KNOW? Whites 38%Hispanics & Asians 22%Blacks 16%Disparities in Adult Vaccination Rates Adult vaccination rates for shingles, as seen in the following statistics from 2016, varied greatly among racial/ethnic groups: xiExpanding first dollar coverage of vaccines to Medicare Part D and encouraging Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Prescription Drug Plans to include immunizations in the zero-cost sharing tier is critical to reducing the barriers to access for seniors. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, which are both covered by Part B, have been received by 70.4% and 66.9% of seniors over the age of 65, respectively. This same population must spend between $14 and $102, on average to receive either the shingles or the Tdap vaccine. These two vaccines, which protect against four diseases, have only been received by 37.4% and 20.4% of seniors, respectively. 26 The cost savings for our economy, coupled with increased workplace productivity, are well worth the investment. We must also help state Medicaid programs understand the value of first dollar coverage, particularly for pregnant women. Nearly half of all births are covered by Medicaid. 27 Depending on the state, however, women may not have access to vaccines recommended during their pregnancy. To help remove financial barriers, many, but not all state Medicaid programs remove vaccination copays for maternal vaccinations. 28 Racial and ethnic disparities also continue in vaccine coverage among adult populations, as Whites are consistently better vaccinated than minority groups. 29 People of color have traditionally been at disproportionate risk for being underinsured, lacking access to quality treatment, and preventive care through health insurance coverage. Unfortunately, this trend extends to pregnant women. Pregnant women of color, particularly Black women, and women who live below the poverty line have up to 20% lower vaccination rates than White women or those with higher socioeconomic statuses. 30 Lower maternal vaccination rates among pregnant women living below the poverty level and/or participating in Medicaid could be a result of many factors including financial barriers, poor access to care, and lack of vaccination recommendations from providers. 31 Insurance Coverage Should Not Dictate Access to Childhood Vaccinesxii PRIVATE INSURANCE VACCINATION RATES FOR MEDICAID | VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 13 ETH - 85WHAT CAN CONGRESS DO? Increase the federal appropriations to the CDC, states and territories so that they are prepared to respond to existing and potential emerging vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks; conduct community outreach; educate providers and the public; maintain and increase onboarding of providers to immunization information systems (IIS); and offer vaccine services to the community. Ensure all children enrolled in state CHIP programs are eligible for VFC vaccines. Such a step will reduce confusion for providers and families and ensure children more timely access to vaccines. Support the Protecting Seniors Through Immunization Act (S. 1872/H.R. 5076 ) to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for vaccines covered under Medicare Part D and improve vaccine awareness and education for beneficiaries.Also increase funding to the Indian Health Service that includes a specific line item for immunizations to support immunization activities, clinical service delivery and electronic health record systems.ONLY 1 IN 3 pregnant women receive both flu and Tdap vaccines ONLY HALF receive either flu or Tdap Black, non-Hispanic women and those who live below the poverty line had up to 20% LOWER VACCINATION RATESPREGNANT WOMEN ARE DRAMATICALLY UNDERVACCINATEDXIII 2020: STATE OF THE IMMUNION | VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 14 ETH - 86Rumors spread quickly both online and among communities.

The issue for many people is finding the right sources to answer their questions. While healthcare providers are usually the best people to ask, we live in an age where many people turn to the internet for answers. Unfortunately, it can often be difficult to tell whether the website or social media page you have found is science-based. When looking up the word \"vaccine\" online, search results provide a mix of dubious websites alongside credible, science-based websites such as the CDC. Intentionally misleading information and false stories about vaccine-related injuries online may lead parents and parents-to-be to decide to delay or refuse vaccines for their children and themselves. MEASLES IS SERIOUSVIII 2020: STATE OF THE IMMUNION | VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 16 ETH - 88In the past year, social media platforms have made great strides in elevating science-based information on vaccines and discontinuing the practice of recommending pages and profiles that contain disinformation about vaccines. Companies such as Facebook, which also owns Instagram, and Pinterest have placed a box at the top of all vaccine-related searches encouraging users to visit the CDC for reliable information about immunizations. Others, such as YouTube, have removed ads from videos promoting false information about vaccines in order to discourage users from posting it. Vaccinate Your Family continues to work closely with these and other companies, along with national and international partners, to offer expertise and support for ongoing efforts to ensure the scientific accuracy of vaccine information available online. In addition to information found online through websites and social media, it is often in-person interactions that can motivate a person to vaccinate. Healthcare providers are key in these types of discussions, but not everyone relies on their doctors' advice as much as they do on their friends' and family members' advice. Many of the measles outbreaks in 2019 happened in tight-knit communities that relied on each other for medical information rather than government agencies, healthcare systems or other \"outside\" organizations. Therefore, it is critical that states and local officials have the resources they need to identify communities with serious concerns about vaccines and create culturally and racially sensitive materials and programs to address their hesitations.WHAT CAN CONGRESS DO? Support the VACCINES Act of 2019 (H.R. 2862) which has been included in the Lower Health Care Costs Act of 2019 (S. 1895), which authorize CDC to begin funding local responses to communities who are hesitant about vaccinating. Become a vaccine champion in your own community. As a leader in your community, many constituents look to you for advice on immunizations.

People have forgotten why it's important to take the time for immunizations, both for themselves and their loved ones. 2020: STATE OF THE IMMUNION | VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 18 ETH - 90At the beginning of the 2019-2020 flu season, the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases conducted a poll and asked: How many adults were planning to receive their flu vaccine during the upcoming season? Only 52% said they planned on receiving it, and one in four who were at higher risk of complications from the disease were planning to skip the vaccine. 32 In the same survey, nearly half of adults at high risk of complications from pneumococcal disease reported they had never even heard of the disease. 33 The fact is that vaccines have done such a good job of reducing and eliminating infectious diseases in the U.S. that many people no longer remember how dangerous these diseases can be. Additionally, many people are not aware that people with chronic health conditions such as heart disease, asthma and diabetes are at increased risk for complications from certain vaccine-preventable diseases. Many of these individuals don't think of themselves as \"sick\" and therefore don't consider themselves to be particularly vulnerable to these serious, and sometimes deadly, diseases. As a result, they may not prioritize getting themselves and their family members vaccinated. Even doctors and other healthcare professionals have not seen these diseases and often call in an older colleague to consult when they suspect a patient has measles or another vaccine-preventable disease. When an outbreak of a disease happens, such as measles, we usually see temporary boosts in immunization coverage in that community. But, in order to avoid future outbreaks, we must help people understand the immense importance of vaccinating on time, every time. People also need to understand the role they play in keeping their communities healthy through \"community immunity.\" Diseases can spread quickly through a community, making a lot of people sick. However, when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, the germs can't travel as easily from person to person, and the entire community is less likely to get the disease. This is known as \"community\" or \"herd\" immunity. Community Protection Thresholds A community protection threshold is the percentage of vaccinated individuals needed in a population to prevent a disease from spreading. VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 19 ETH - 91The levels of vaccination rates needed to protect communities from diseases vary based on several factors, including how infectious the disease is and how well the vaccine works. As a society, it is important that we work together to protect one another from deadly diseases. By maintaining high vaccination rates we not only protect ourselves, but we also protect vulnerable infants who are not fully vaccinated yet and people of all ages with weakened or failing immune systems. If we stopped vaccinating, the limited number of vaccine-preventable disease cases we have in the United States could very quickly become tens or hundreds of thousands of cases. Share your own story. If you remember these diseases, or remember your parents or grandparents talking about vaccine-preventable diseases, share those stories with your constituents. Research shows that personal stories can help people better understand the dangers these diseases pose and possibly influence their behavior. Let your local media know you support vaccines. Reporters want to know where legislators stand on vaccination policy. Let them know that you believe in the value of vaccinations and that you support strong immunization legislation.Learn how your constituents have been affected by vaccine-preventable diseases. Unfortunately, these diseases do still affect people in the U.S. Ask your constituents about their experiences and use your platform to share those with your broader community. Reach out to major hospital networks in your state to discuss the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases. Additionally, Vaccinate Your Family is available to assist if you wish to connect with immune-compromised individuals that rely on community immunity to keep them safe from vaccine-preventable diseases. WHAT CAN CONGRESS DO? 2020: STATE OF THE IMMUNION | VACCINATE YOUR FAMILY | 20 ETH - 92Congress has a critical role to play in preventing and eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases. Your work on national policy sets the stage for many people on the state and local levels to raise immunization rates.

Historically, federal vaccine appropriations have remained fairly stagnant and are far below the levels requested in CDC's Congressional budget justifications, and state budgets for vaccine infrastructure are nearly non-existent. This has resulted in a loss of essential immunization program personnel and the disbanding of several highly effective statewide immunization coalitions, which supported vaccination programs for decades. Also increa se funding to the Indian Health Service that includes a specific line item for immunizations to support immunization activities, clinical service delivery and electronic health records.

These bills will then require appropriations to ensure CDC has enough funds to enhance, not detract from, current vaccination education activities. Suppo rt the Protecting Seniors through Immunization Act (S. 1872/H.R. 5076), which eliminates out-of-pocket costs for vaccines covered under Medicare Part D and improves vaccine awareness and education for beneficiaries.

The public must be reas sured that the timing of vaccines is carefully considered prior to CDC's recommendations and that prior to and following licensure, vaccine safety is heavily monitored by various departments within HHS, CDC, and FDA, and through long-term health plan collaboratives. There are many disproven myths about the safety of vaccines that continue to circulate, negatively impacting your constituents' understanding of the safety and value of vaccines, and threatening the health of your communities. You can be an immunization champion by knowing how to respond to your constituents' concerns and offering evidence-based responses.
