Conventional medicine, on the other hand, focuses on managing symptoms through medication. Homeopathic remedies, such as Belladonna, Natrum Muriaticum, and Glonoinum, have shown effectiveness in treating migraines by reducing the frequency, intensity, and duration of headaches.

They may also assess the patient's reflexes, balance, and coordination. In homeopathy, the diagnostic process may involve a more in-depth analysis of the patient's symptoms and overall health, including their mental and emotional state.
