In these current times it's important, now more than ever, to really look after our health. Recently, I've been getting many questions and messages from people concerned about their immune system, and asking what they can do, or take, to boost their immune system. As we tackle isolation, as well as the end of daylight savings and a change in season (lucky us!), I've compiled a list of my top tips to help support your immunity and overall health. An important note: There is no magic pill, food or supplement that will completely protect you against, or cure, coronavirus. The best method of prevention is by washing your hands, social distancing, avoiding touching your face, and of course practicing proper hygiene. If you begin to feel unwell, seek medical advice by calling Healthline for free on [0800 358 5453]or call your doctor immediately. Reduce and manage your stress levels It's well known that stress weakens the immune system. When we're stressed, our lymphocytes (the white blood cells that help fight off infection) are reduced. The lower the lymphocyte level, the more at risk we are for viruses. If you're stressed, it's really important to add some \"me time\" into your day and make calming your nervous system a priority. Practicing meditation, breathing exercises, yoga or tai chi are all ways that are scientifically shown to help reduce stress levels as well as boost the immune system. Remember, a problem shared is a problem halved, so make sure you also speak to someone you trust such as a friend, family member, or a registered counsellor or psychologist. Sleep, sleep, sleep While many of us might be staying up late watching Tiger King (no? Just me??) it's important to hit the hay at an appropriate time and ensure you're getting enough sleep each night. Too little sleep lowers our immune function, and [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4568388/)have shown that those who don't get enough sleep or a good quality sleep are more likely to get sick after being exposed to a virus. Aim to get a good 8 hours of sleep each night. If you're struggling to get to sleep or stay asleep, try having a hot shower or a bath with epsom salts before bed, limiting your screen time, reading a good book to relax and making sure your room is completely dark. If you're still struggling, [contact me](/contact)for a personalised herbal sleep formula. Look after your gut There is a MAJOR connection between the health of our gut and our immune system. In fact, up to [70% of our immune cells actually live in our intestine](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-90545-7_8). Eating fermented foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi and yoghurt, as well as eating enough fibre is a good way to support a healthy gut microbiome and balance of good gut bacteria. Supplementing with a good quality probiotic is another way to help support your gut and your digestion, as well as your immune system. Move your body Getting in some form of exercise each day is a great way to give your immune system a boost. Exercise such as walking, jogging, biking, swimming and yoga can not only [improve immune function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26477922), but can also help to lower inflammation in the body. But don't over do it! Too much intense exercise such as HITT training can actually have the opposite effect, so make sure you balance out your workouts or have rest days between intense session. Get enough zinc Zinc is a trace mineral that is essential for proper immune function. [Studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003986116300741)have shown that zinc deficiency lowers immunity, which therefore can put us at risk of infection from bacteria or viruses. Other [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28515951)has also shown that supplementing with zinc can reduce the duration of the common cold by up to 33%. Zinc is found naturally in foods such as oysters, mussels, red meat, chicken, yoghurt, wholegrains, nuts and seeds. When it comes to supplementation, I recommend 15-30mg per day to support the immune system. [Contact me](/contact)to see if a zinc supplement is right for you. Cut back on the sweets Many of us are spending our days at home with frequent trips to the pantry for treats or simply baking a shitload of banana bread. While there can be some comfort found in yummy food, the bad news is that too much sugar can lower our immune system. It's best to cut back on the sweets and treat food and load up on fresh vegetables and fruit which are high in nutrients and antioxidants, which brings me nicely to my next tip... Eat colourful, antioxidant rich foods Colourful fruits and vegetables such as carrots, capsicum, tomato, broccoli, kale, berries, oranges and lemons are all rich in vitamins and antioxidants which play an important role in supporting a strong immune system and keeping us healthy. Herbs such as turmeric, garlic and ginger are also great sources of antioxidants and are known to have anti-viral properties which may help to support the immune system to fight off bugs. Elderberry Elderberry (Sambucus nigra) is well known to have anti-viral properties and has also shown to help [boost the immune system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1756464619300313). [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848651/)have shown that taking elderberry can reduce cold and flu symptoms as well as the shorten the duration of influenza. For the best immune support, I recommend elderberry in a herbal tincture, alongside other immune supporting herbs such as ginger, licorice, withania and echinacea.

Olive leaf Olive leaf (Olea europaea) is another one of my favourite immune supporting herbs which has powerful [anti-viral effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002804/). One [recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744092)found that olive leaf given to high school athletes during their competitive season reduced their number of sick days by 28%. Like elderberry, olive leaf can be taken either on its own, or as part of a personalised herbal formula for full health and wellness support.
