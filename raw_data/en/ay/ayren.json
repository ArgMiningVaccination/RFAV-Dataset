Heat Sensitive Products Frequently Asked Questions We understand that many customers have concerns about receiving a heat sensitive item in the mail and we hear a lot of questions about this. We have put together this list of Frequently Asked Questions to help you understand our process and to help alleviate any concerns you may have. Q: How do you store heat sensitive products in your warehouse? A: All heat sensitive products are stored in a refrigerated area of our warehouse from the moment we receive them in from the manufacturer to the day your order ships. Q: Do you ship heat sensitive products with a cold pack? A: Yes, all heat sensitive products are shipped with a cold pack for no additional cost. Q: My package arrived and the cold pack isn't frozen. Is the product ok? A: Yes, the product is fine. We include cold packs to keep the product cool in transit, but thawing over time is natural. Q: My heat sensitive product is warm or even hot. Is it ok? A: Yes, heat sensitive products can be exposed to high temperatures over short periods of time without concern of the heat harming the product. This also includes Probiotics. Cold packs are included in these shipments to keep the product cool in transit. Q: Why do you recommend I ship it One or Two Day Shipping? A: A heat sensitive product shipped via Standard Shipping (3-7 business days) is not within the manufacturers' shipping standards for this type of product; therefore we cannot guarantee that the product has maintained 100% of its potency. Q: I placed my order for One Day Shipping on a Friday. When will I receive it? A: Since expedited shipping companies don't normally deliver on Saturdays or Sundays we hold all One or Two Day Shipping orders containing a heat sensitive product until Monday to ensure they are only in transit for one or two days based on the following criteria. Heat Sensitive products ordered after 2:00 pm ET Wednesday will be shipped out Monday when Two Day Shipping is selected. Heat Sensitive products ordered after 2:00 pm ET Thursday will be shipped out Monday when One Day Shipping is selected. Q: How do I store my heat sensitive product? A: To maintain maximum potency, you should refrigerate the heat sensitive product as soon as you receive it. We recommend allowing the product to cool for several hours before opening the bottle and storing it in your refrigerator with the lid tightly closed immediately after each use. Q: Can I return my heat sensitive product? A: Yes! While other online retailers do not allow for returns of heat sensitive products, we stand behind our 90-Day Hassle Free Returns policy for all items we sell. Heat sensitive products that are returned to us are never resold. Q: I still have more questions. What can I do? A: Please call us at 800-921-4271 and one of our trained Customer Service Representatives will assist you. We are available to answer your calls from 9 am - 5pm ET. You may also email us at customerservice@thenatural.com. Thank you for choosing The Natural. "}
