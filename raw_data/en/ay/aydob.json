For any assistance please call on 1800-209-0144 Of late, traditional and alternative forms of treatment like Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Unani etc. have been garnering a lot of popularity. People highly revere Ayurveda, because of its natural foundations and plant-based medication with no side-effects. This trend shift is visible not only in India but all across the globe. Similarly, homeopathy has also surfaced as a highly preferred alternative to the allopathy treatment. Insurance cover for alternate treatment In 2013, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) proposed insurance coverage for Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) treatments as well, which was accepted by the insurers. A policy document released by AYUSH explicitly listed the diseases, specific therapies, treatment procedure, average period of hospitalization and other expenses that could be considered for coverage under the [health insurance](https://www.bajajallianz.com/health-insurance-plans.html) plan. AYUSH cover in a heal [th insurance policy] Medical coverage for AYUSH treatments is offered by many health insurers in India. However, a healthcare plan that provides coverage for Ayurveda, Homeopathic and other alternative treatments might have an upper cap on the coverage limit. This limit can be quoted either as a percentage of the sum insured or as a lump sum. So, in case a policyholder makes a claim for Ayurvedic and Homeopathic treatment, it will be settled up to the limit specified in the health insurance policy. How to file a claim for AYUSH treatment? To claim coverage for AYUSH treatments, one has to be hospitalised for at least 24 hours in any government recognised Ayurveda hospital or institute. However, if the purpose of hospitalisation is only medical evaluation, then the claim will not be entertained by the insurer. Also, treatments for the rejuvenation of the body, which is an integral part of Ayurveda, is generally excluded from the cover. This means that therapeutic or wellness related treatments must be paid out of pocket.
