Our store happens to be across the way from an amazing Crystal shop and it is always busy, sending off vibrations down the hall of our beloved [Grove Arcade](https://grovearcade.com/stores/adoratherapy/) and attracting anyone and everyone. Not everyone knows why they are so attracted to crystals but they do know they can't keep away from these colorful shiny and carved stones. We have our share of books on crystals and love learning each crystal's unique properties. But did you know that crystals can support your chakras? That is why, during our [aura reading](https://adoratherapy.com/products/aura-products-test-landing-page) we gift a [crystal heart](https://adoratherapy.com/collections/accessories) to support, always choosing a stone to work on a chakra that needs more support, love and balancing. Why do we do this? Crystals are a part of the vibrational healing tool kit and having a crystal in your pocket, on your altar can make a difference. Crystals are Vibrational Crystals have long been used in technology applications, especially electronics like lasers and solar power. Quartz is especially good and that is why it is used in watches. When stimulated with electricity (a form of energy), it creates regular oscillations that are so precise it helps keep time. Crystals can produce measurable electrical voltage, and they induce mechanical movement. Crystals have frequencies and as a result have impact on the subtle energetics of our bodies. When used in healing, not only by an experienced practitioner but by anyone who has the intention for their own healing, crystals can amplify and direct energy. We like to amplify our crystals with a \"Mother-Father\" crystal, typically a larger crystal that has been amplified itself. When we create these grids we allow source energy from the master crystal to inspire and activate the other crystals. This technique called a \"crystal grid\" is powerful and beautiful. Around our house we have many grids, for protection, abundance, meditation and love. Holding a crystal in your hand while touching the body, yours or the person you are healing uses the energy of the palm chakra. As the energy passes through the crystal it can be used to rebalance and cleanse healthy and blocked chakras. Both the healer and the subject can amplify the crystal energy. Part mind, part matter, adding the intention to the healing matters. You can direct the energy inwards to flow, or outwards to leave the body. Placing numerous crystals on the body or around the body in a grid like pattern is a wonderful way to activate all the chakras and anchor the subject wholly. Anointing Crystals with essential oils Crystals can charge elixirs, liquids made with crystal energy, similar to how flower essences are made, and are called \"gem elixirs\". Crystals are often imprinted by the places and people who have held them before. Therefore crystals should be reprogrammed and cleared before using them. We always cleanse our crystals when they arrive, putting them in the sun, bathing them in water and anointing them with essential oils, therefore claiming them as our own with an affirmation and invitation. Anointing crystals can be a one time effort or it can be an ongoing practice. We anoint when we want to introduce ceremony into our spiritual practices such as meditation. It is recommended to hold your crystal in your left hand when meditating because it is connected to the right side of your brain, which is attuned to your consciousness and your third eye. We like to anoint our crystals in our hand, adding oils to our palm and then placing our crystal inside the palm. Close your fist and send intention and white light. You can then open your hand and cover the stone on all sides. You can then wipe your stone off or lay it in the sun to dry. Using the oil left in your hand, rub your palms together and make prayer hands and breathe in deeply placing them in front of your face and nose. Connecting our breath, the oils and the crystal is a powerful ceremony that will have benefits beyond the chakras. You can also put your stones in a a small bowl and anoint them. You can choose a simple oil, using about 1% of the pure oil and a carrier like jojoba or a massage oil for the rest. Keep the oil in a bottle you can reuse for your other crystals. They will appreciate the homecoming! You can even use this oil for a massage or self anointing before a hot bath when oils are safely diluted. If you have our [Chakra Boost ](https://adoratherapy.com/collections/chakra-perfume-oils)products you can get match the chakra balancing oil to the stone and chakra, creating a specific stone and healing for each chakra point. Many crystal stores sell chakra stone kits and so do we with our recent addition of an [Abundance](https://adoratherapy.com/collections/accessories/products/abundance-crystal-grid-kit-with-anointing-oil) and [Meditation](https://adoratherapy.com/collections/accessories/products/meditation-crystal-grid-kit-with-anointing-oil) grid kit. We have sourced beautiful heart shaped crystals and they are available on [our website](https://adoratherapy.com/collections/accessories). Crystals and Chakras Crystals and gemstones are classified by their seven unique crystalline structures: - Triclinic - Monoclinic - Orthorhombic - Tetragonal - Hexagonal - Cubic - Trigonal It is said that the structure of the crystal provides its healing qualities. Cubic crystals are good for meditation and include: diamonds, garnets and fluorites. Whereas hexagonal crystals like emeralds and aquamarines are best for building energy and vitality so can be used for healing, balancing and communicating. Tetragonal stones are good for absorbing negative energy, providing protection and positive vibrations. You can spend a lot of time learning about each crystal and how to apply its unique properties to specific chakra healings. Many of us associate the color of the stone to a specific chakra and there is nothing wrong about this. Knowing that crystals work in many ways is key to using them in your healing rituals and practices. More important than anything is knowing that each crystal is unique and possesses a spiritual, energetic and resonance that you can activate for your maximum healing. This is the \"pet rock\" we've all been waiting for. Crystals enhance the action of essential oils. Quartz varietals are extremely popular, easy to come by and affordable. There are so many types and colors and matching the vibration of stones to the vibration of oils takes our healing practice to the next level. From rose, to smoky, amethyst to strawberry, quartz stones are a mixture of silicon dioxide and other elements. Quartzes are the perfect stones for chakra healing. At Adoratherapy, we take crystals and oils seriously and have matched stones, our packaging colors and oils vibrations to create maximum healing: [Vitality Chakra Boost](https://adoratherapy.com/collections/chakra-perfume-oils/products/adoratherapy-vitality-chakra-perfume-oil), in its red box, for the root chakra contains sandalwood and is associated with carnelian energy.

Crystal Chakra Healing Rituals Creating breathtaking rituals is a beautiful way to heal ourselves. There are so many ways to do this on our own our in ceremony with another or a group. Chakra Body Grid Lay on the floor and with the assistance of someone or, on your own, place a corresponding [crystal on each of the chakras](https://adoratherapy.com/blogs/chakras-in-motion/7-crystals-for-your-chakras). Focus on each chakra starting with your root and add the color of that chakra to that area of the body, imagining a swirling colorful tornado inside and around that area. Imagine the crystal acting as an amplifier and the energy transferring from the chakra to the crystal and back. Move up the body repeating this for the six remaining chakras, each time adding an intention for flow, balance and maximum vibration and healing. End the ceremony by adding white light all around. your body, purifying and amplifying your auric field. You can add obsidian or tourmaline at your feet, hands and neck around you for protection and grounding. Third Eye Meditation Anoint your your amethyst or lapis crystal with [Clarity](https://adoratherapy.com/collections/chakra-perfume-oils/products/adoratherapy-clarity-chakra-perfume-oil) Chakra Boost or your favorite oil using your left hand and close your hand while sitting in a comfortable position. Bring your palms together up to your face and nose and breathe in deeply. Use your favorite meditation and breathing technique to anchor into a calm state while your hands move up to your forehead. Holding your crystal in your prayer hands or directly on your third eye with your thumb and first finger, with your closed eyes stare at the back of your eyelids as though your eyes are open. You will have a strong pulling sensation and eventually your eyes will want to roll up. Allow them to and relax the eye muscles as though you were gazing softly with half opened eyes while the eyes are still closed. Invite in the opening of the third eye, trusting your intuition and clairvoyance. Swirl the colors indigo and purples inside your head until they turn white and clear. Protection Ritual with Obsidian Another way to cleanse your crystals is with incense or smudge sticks. Our obsidian protection wand is a favorite, made with oregano, lavender, yarrow and adorned with an obsidian crystal, this protection wand is all about banishing negative energies, calming and stepping forth in confidence and strength in support of our root chakra grounding. Obsidian is commonly associated with neutralizing negative energies and protection, decreasing stress and sharpening the mind. Lavender invites in calm and relaxation, and oregano and rosemary are associated with healing and protection. Black sage banishes negative energies, while wormwood severs negative cords. Adding smudging rituals to your breath-taking practice when you want purification and amplification of your intention is a powerful ritual. The sacred smoke released from burning specific herbs can be used to open energetic pathways between chakras, bring chakras into alignment, and clear out stagnant energy. Create a ceremony for each chakra and set your intention. We adore adding crystals to the smudging rituals as they absorb and intensify emotions, situations, memories and vibration. Light your smudge, set your intention and breathe. Crystals are powerful, energetic tools that when added to rituals and healing practices amplify your intention. Trust your intuition and create your own or follow some of ours and continue to enhance your healing journey with confidence. "}
