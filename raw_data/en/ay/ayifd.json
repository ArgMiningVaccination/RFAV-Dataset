Brown, Executive Secretary State Conservation Commission FROM: Michael J. Walker, NM Regional Coordinator State Conservation Commission SUBJECT: Nutrient Management Plan Review (1) Northumberland County, Pennsylvania Action Requested Action on a Nutrient Management Plan for the following operation in Northumberland County: 1.Burnell & Sharon Nolt , 197 Hunters Junction Dornsife, PA 17823 (crop years 2020 - 2022 ) Background I have completed the required review of the subject nutrient management plan listed above. Final corrections to the plan were received at the PD A Region 2 office on January 28, 2019 . As of that date, the plan was considered to be in its final form. The operation, located in Northumberland County, is considered to be a concentrated animal operation ( CAO) under the PA Nutrient and Odor Management Act. The Commission is the proper authority to take action on this plan, because Northumberland County Conservation District has not been delegated plan review and action responsibil ities under the PA Nutrient and Odor Management Act Program. A brief description of the operation, concluding with the staff recomme ndation, is attached. Also attached is a copy of the complete nutrient management plan for the operation. Thank you for considering this plan for Commission action. Agenda Item B.2.a542 COUNTY FARM ROAD, MONTOURSVILLE, PA 17754 -9621 PHONE 570 -433-2640 (FAX) Sharon , Northumberland County - Burnell and Sharon Nolt are operating a broiler chicken operation in southern Northumberland County. The farm consists of 2.7 acres of cropland, 0 acres of hayland, 0 acres of pasture and 13.3 acres of farmstead. The cropland acres owned by Nolt are rented to a neig hboring crop farmer, so no lands are under control of the Nolts. The broiler poultry operation average 70, 000 broiler chickens that are housed in two barns (35,000 per barn). The chickens are totally confined to the barn. Manure is handled as a solid a nd collected and removed after each flock. Manure is either exported directly from the barns or stacked in the 40 by 64 by 6 roofed manure storage facility. There is also a roofed mortality facility attached to the manure storage, which measures 40 by 8 by 6, with 5 bins for composting the mortality. The mortality compost is mixed with the manure when exported. Approximately 730 tons of broiler manure is generated at Nolt's animal o peration . All collected manure and mortality compost is exported to the neighboring crop farmer for land application to cropland. The proposed NMP includes Nutrient Balance Sheets (NBSs) for the neighboring operator to utilize the manure from Nolt animal operation. The combined animal equivalent units on the Nolt's animal operation are planned at 183.82. The animal equivalent units per acre for Nolt's animal operation equals to 183.82, classifying the operation as a concentrated animal operation under Act 38 of 2005. Based on my review, the NMP developed for Burnell & Sharon Nolt animal operation meets the requirements of the PA Nutrient and Odor Management Act and Regulations, and I therefore recommend Commission approval.

The nutrient management plan has been developed as a: (check one) 1-Year Plan for Crop Year (annual updates will be completed) X 3-Year Plan for Crop Years 2020 2021 2022 Records required to be maintained include the following: 1) Annual crop yields 2) Manure and fertilizer application rates, locations and date of application 3) Manure production figures for the various manure groups listed in your plan 4) Soil test reports (testing required every 3 years per crop management unit) 5) Manure test reports (testing required once a year for each manure group) 6) Number of animals on pasture, number of days on pasture, and hours per day on pasture 7) For operations exporting manure, Manure Export Sheets 8) BMP designs and certification for new liquid and semi -solid manure storage facilities The following has been confirmed: X Verification of Ag E&S Plan X Verification of Existing Site Specific Emergency Response Plan Verification that owners of rented/leased lands have been notified that a nutrient management plan has been developed which calls for manure to be applied to their lands and that they have no objections to the plan requirements. Owners Notified X No Rented/Leased Lands Specialist Signature I affirm that the information contained in this nutrient management plan is true, accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, based on information provided by the operator ; that this plan has been developed in accordance with the criteria established for the program(s) indicated above ; and that I have presented the final complete plan to the operator and discussed the content and implementation of this plan with the operator, subject to the penalties of 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4904, relating to unsworn falsification to authorities . Specialist Signature Date 01/21/19 Version 6.3 - August 2018 Appendix 2 - Operation Information Page 1 Appendix 2 Operation Information Operation Description Animal types and numbers; cropland, hayland and pastureland acreage; farmstead acreage; crop rotation (crops, sequence of crops, and number of years for each crop); manure group management, including atypical manure (contributing animal groups, collection, storage and handling procedures); mortality composting management. Burnell and Sharon Nolt raise broiler chickens at their farm in Northumberland County , PA. The farm consists of 2.7 acres of cropland, 0 acres of hayland, 0 acres of pasture and 13.3 acres of farmstead. All cropland acres are rented to another farmer who utilizes them to raise corn grain and soybeans. All crops are established u sing no -till planting methods. The poultry operation average s a total of 70 ,000 broiler chickens housed in two barns (35,0 00 broilers per barn). Broiler chickens are 100% confined to the barns and do not have access to pasture . Collected poultry manure is handled as a solid and removed from the barns between each flock of chickens. Stacking areas for sawdust bedding are located outside the east end of each building. Depending on the time of year, when manure is removed from the barns it is either immediately exported off of the operation or stored in an existing roofed concrete manure stacking stru cture located north of the poultry barns. Manure export typically take s place in the spring, fall and winter. Exported manure gen erated by this operation is imported by the farmer currently ren ting and operating the Nolt's owned cropland. These fields are included in the Nutrient Balance Sheets in Appendix 8. Poul try moralities are composted on the operation in a roofed bin composter attached to the north end of the roofed concrete manure stacking structure. Mortality compost is mixed in with the collected poultry manure as needed during manure export off the operation . A rabbit barn built by the previous owner of the farm exists on the operation; however the Nolt's do not have any rabbits housed in the barn at this time and are not planning on raising rabbits in the future.

Briefly describe, for each manure group, manure storage management during removal (degree of agitation, method of man ure removal, extent the storage is emptied, type of unremoved manure, etc.) and manure sampling procedures. A 40' x 64' x 6' roofed concrete manure stacking structure is located on the operation. This structure is used to store solid poultry manure. With manure stacked to a height of 10 feet in the center of the structure, the storage holds approximately 22,43 7 cubic feet of manure with sawdust bedding. No runoff or waste water is added to this structure. Manure is added to the storage by being hauled from the barns with a loader tractor and dump truck and then dumped into the structure. The majority, if not all of, the manure is removed from the storage during clean out. A representative manure sample was taken directly from the manure storage in the structure. A 40' x 8' x 6' - 5 bin mortality composter is attached to the north end of the structure. Mort ality compost is mixed in with the collected poultry manure as needed during manure export off the operation. Manure Application Equipment Capacity & Practical Application Rates Description of application equipment, practical application rates based on calibration and calibration method used, the data recorded during equipment calibration is to be retained on the farm. If applicable, name and Act 49 certification number of custom applicator. This section is not relevant to this farm situation because n o cropped fields are included in this plan.

October 2017 Version Exporter/Importer Agreement Manure Used For Agricultural Land Application Developed consistent with the PA Nutrient and Odor Management Act Program 1) This agreement is entered into on December 18 , 2018 , by Burnell Nolt (the \"exporter\") who will supply manur e, and Paul Billow (the \"importer\"), who will receive the manure from the exporter. 2) The purpose of this agreement is to set forth the mutual responsibilities and understanding of the parties with respect to the export of manure from the exporter to the importer. 3) The exporter is located at (county, twp, and address): Northumberland County, Washington Township 197 Hunters Junction Road, Dornsife, PA 17823 4) The exporter will, as the supply of manure allows, provide the following amounts of manure during the seasons outlined below: Tons of Poultry manure, per season: Spring 244 tons or Summer 0 tons or Fall 244 tons or Winter 244 tons Gallons of N/A manure, per season: Spring 0 gallons or Summer 0 gallons or Fall 0 gallons or Winter 0 gallons Total planned manure exported: (supply of manure may be less than what is planned) Tons of Poultry manure: up to a total of 730 tons per year Gallons of N/A manure: 0 gallons If multi-species are planned, please add additional lines: 5) The importer's location and other relevant information as it relates to this manure export, is as follows (maps indicating the location of importing fields must be attached to the supporting Nutrient Balance Sheets if manure is to be land applied at the importing site): a) Phone number : 570- 850-9512 b) County(s) Spring Dornsife, PA 17823 d) Township(s) : Washington d) Owner(s) of the property receiving manure: Paul Billow, Dennis Kieffer, Kathy Paul e) Total cropland acres managed by the importer : 325 acres f) Number and type of animals raised by the importer : None g) Number of acres available for this imported manure: 303.1 acres h) Other manures (type, amount) imported to the site AND/OR utilized on the site : (Note- this would include manure that is generated on the site by the importers animals, etc.) None If other manure is generated, imported and/or utilized, is it applied to the same acres as indicated in item \"g\" above (relating to \"acres available\") : N/A If other manure is generated, imported and/or utilized, is it applied during the same season as the imported manure: N/A October 2017 Version 6) The exporter will use a Manure Export Shee t to record all manure export ed to the importer. These Manure Export Sheets are available from the county conservation district or the State Conservation Commission. Computer generated forms other than the manure export sheet may be used if they con tain the same information as, and are reasonably similar in format to, the forms available from the State Conservation Commission or the conservation district. 7) Records relating to the export of manure shall be prepared by the exporter in accordance wit h the following requirements of the Nutrient and Odor Management Act regulations: a) A Manure Export Sheet shall be used to document all manure exports for their records A copy of the Manure Export Sheet shall be provided to the importer A copy of the Manure Export Sheet shall be retained on site by the exporter b) When the exporter (or someone working for, or contracted by the exporter) applies the exported manure, the exporter shall maintain the following exported manure records: Application dates, areas, rates and methods c) Records shall be maintained by the exporter for a minimum of 3 years d) A manure export informational packet (as supplied by the conservation district or State Conservation Commission) shall be provided to the importer by the time of the manure export. This information only needs to be provided once to the importer. The manure export informational packet must include the following: i. Exported Manure Informational Packet Guidance Sheet ii. Nutrient Management Planning an Overview (Agronomy Facts 60) iii. Manure Management for Environmental Protection iv. Land Application of Manure - A supplement to the Manure Management Manual Plan Guidance v. Manure Export Sheet vi. Manure Transfer Summary Sheets vii. Manure Field Stacking Requirements Fact Sheet 8) Where applicable, the importer shall properly store manure received from the exporter in accordance with the provisions of the Manure Management Manual and the Pa Technical Guide and shall not cause contamination of surface or ground water. This shall i nclude manure stacked in application fields which may not be retained in fields for > 120 days unless covered or otherwise protected . 9) Manure received by the importer shall be applied to the land at the rate(s) and method(s) provided in the attached \"N utrient Balance Sheet(s)\", or in accordance with a Nutrient Management Plan approved for the importing operation. If the importer wishes to change the lands used for imported manure, the nutrient balance sheet must be revised to reflect the changes and be submitted to the conservation district or State Conservation Commission (and DEP if the exporter is a CAFO) prior to implementing the changes. 10) The importer shall comply with applicable manure application setbacks for the imported manure, as outlined in the Nutrient Balance Sheet map(s). 11) For any lands not owned by the importer where the manure will be applied (i.e., rented lands), the importer hereby confirms that the importer has the authority to apply manure on those lands.

If the spill involves a public road: a. Contact the police for traffic control: State Police - 911 b. Use flares, safety cones, etc. to warn approaching motorists 2) Stop the source of the spill: a. If the spill occurs while emptying the barn / storage: i. Stop removal of manure from the structure ii. Take measures to ensure that the spilled solid manure is not entering surface water b. If the spill happens while on the road: i. Pull off to the side of the road ii. Plug the leak or otherwise stop the flow of manure from the spreader iii. Take measures to keep manure from entering into streams, ditc hes, etc. iv. Call the police for traffic control: State Police - 911 3) Contain and control the spill: a. Build a containment area to capture and aid in collecting the manure using soil, grav el, hay bales, etc. Limit the area in contact with manure. Local individuals with access to excavation and manure hauling equipment are: i. Paul Billow - ii. Stacy Snyder - 570- 850- 3752 b. If necessary, locate an emergency field stacking areas using the following guidelines: i. Stacked piles should be stacked in a cone or windrow shape so as to shed rainwater. This shape limitation would not be necessary if, upon stacking, the stack will be covered with an impermeable cover. ii. Stacks should be setback 100 feet from streams (intermittent and perennial), lakes, ponds, open existing sinkholes, and active water wells. iii. Stacks should not be located in water concentration areas, such as a swale, ditch, or waterway. iv. Stacks should not be located on areas th at have excessively drained soils. This limitation would not be necessary if, upon stacking, the stack will be covered with an impermeable cover. v. Stacks should not be located within 3 feet of the seasonal high water table. vi.

If a spill enters a sinkhole or otherwise has the potential to enter groundwater, notify adjacent landowner s who use private wells for their water supply. 5) Clean up the spill: a. Clean up procedures may be directed by the authorities listed above. b. Pick up absorbent materials (if required) you used and properly dispose of the material. c. Restore damaged areas if necessary. DATE: February 20 , 2019 TO: State Conservation Commission Members FROM: Frank X. Schneider Director, Nutrient and Odor Management Programs THROUGH: Karl G. Brown Executive Secretary, State Conservation Commission REFERENCE: Nutrient Balance Sheet - Phosphorus Planning The State Conservation Commission (SCC) and the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) reviewed how Phosphorus is planned, handled , and managed in Act 38 Nutrient Balance Sheets (NBS). The SCC and PSU briefed the Nutrient Management Advisory Board (NMAB) at their August 16, 2018 meeting on two topics and possible changes that include: 1.Removal of Phosphorus Banking in Option 1 (Phosph orus Removal) of the NBS. 2.Planning Options for Option 3 (Phosphorus Index) in the NBS . The SCC and PSU hosted a webinar on September 12, 2018 to introduce the topic to the planning and review community. At the conclusion of the webinar, the SCC opened a comment period on the two topics addressed above. The comment period ended November 16, 2018. On October 30, 2018, the NMAB had a subcommittee meeting to discuss the two topics presented. A total of 24 comments were received during the open comment period and the NMAB subcommittee meeting . The comments and responses are attached . In regards to topic #1 - Removal of Phosphorus Banking in Option 1 (Phosphorus Removal) of the NBS, t he SCC workgroup and NMAB recommend that the P -Banking Option be removed from Option 1 of NBS development. In regards to topic #2 - Planning Options for Option 3 (Phosphorus Index) in the NBS , the SCC workgroup and NMAB recommend that the next version of the NBS have the following: 1.Two separate input decks (One deck for Option 1 and 2 and One deck for Option 3) . 2.One Summary sheet for the farmer or hauler/broker (combining both input decks) . 3.Post crop grouping, to combine fields with similar application recommendation, etc., for ease of i mplementation . Agenda Item B.2.bAt this time, staff is asking for an approval action. If approval is granted, SCC and PSU staff will update the NBS development tools and time the release with changes made under the next version of the Technical Manual, to be brought to th e SCC at a later date. ATTACHMENTS: - Comment Document Agenda Item B.2.bNutrient Balance Sheets and Phosphorus Management Summary of Comments Received January 29 , 2019 Page 1 of 8 A Meeting to discuss comme nts received during the Nutrient Balance Sheets and Phosphorus Management Open Comment Period was held on December 12, 2018 . Meeting At tendees: Frank Schneider Kate Bresaw Arthur Ulrich Charlie White Jerry Martin Johan Berger Peter Vanderstappen Michael Aucoin Mark Jackson Mark Goodson Don Orner Listed below are comments received during the Nutrient Balance Sheets and Phosphorus Management open comment period. Recommendation s were made to incorporate or dismiss the comment . There were a total of 24 comments received during the open comment period. The comment and response are listed below and were presented to the Nutrient Management Advisory Board at their January 17, 2019 . The NMAB agreed with the recommendations of the workgroup. Commentators: 1 - Martin Krone 2 - RoseTree Consulting 3 - TeamAg Meeting 4 - Melissa Rubano, R&R Engineering 5 - Lisa Blazure, Clinton County Conservation District 6 - York County Conservation District Comment 1 - Phosphorus Banking Comment As a Plan writer, I have rarely used i t. If it was not available, I doubt if I would miss it. I think y our argument #1 regarding soil tests is a valid argument. I think your argument #2 for equipment improvements may not be valid. Some of your commercial haulers and more progressiv e farmers will have application equipment that can apply low rates. However, there are some farmers wi th older equipment yet. Still, I think it is a moot point. P -Banking can be deleted and not missed in my book. (1 , 5, 6 ) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12 /18 The workgroup recommends that the P -Banking Option be removed from Option 1 of NBS development . Issue Comment 2 - Phosphorus Banking Comment Plan Development Costs: A portion of managing fertilizer needs on a farm is also about managing the costs associated with NBS development. Producers choose to use manure as a lower cost alternative to commercial fertilizer. Plan development costs influence that decision. Traditionally, Option 1 NBS are the least costly alternative for clients, while Option 3 are the highest cost alternative. Option 1 seems to be the most restrictive way of writing NBS with manure rates that equal or are less than P removal of the crop and increased Nutrient Balance Sheets and Phosphorus Management Summary of Comments Received January 29 , 2019 Page 2 of 8 manure application setbacks from surface water. We would support removing Option 1 from the planning process only if an equally low -cost alternative was developed. (2, 4) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The proposal was not to eliminate option 1 from NBS development but to ONLY eliminate the P Banking portion of Option 1 . Issue Comment 3 - Phosphorus Banking Comment Tracking Compliance: Any method used to track compliance relies on the honesty of the indiv idual operating the farm, the relationship they have with their plan writer, and the integrity of the plan writer. Option 1 can be misused as often as Option 3. We rely on the integrity of farm operators when recording where manure was applied, if setback s were adhered to, what manure application rates were, and what supplemental fertilizer was applied. Eliminating Option 1 will not improve this process. Additional clarity surrounding recordkeeping requirements for manure applications may be helpful for agencies and farmers to track manure applications. (2) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The proposal was not to eliminate option 1 from NBS development but to ONLY eliminate the P Banking portion of Option 1 . Issue Comment 4 - Phosphorus Banking Comment Ability to Apply Manure at Lower Rates : SCC staff stated on the webinar that on today's farms, farmers have the ability to apply manure at lower rates due to advances in equipment design and manufacturing. This is true - but on ly for farms that have invested in such equipment. In recent years, a number of our clients have invested in new equipment not purchased with low application rates as their end goal. For example - a dairy/beef operation invests $30,000+ on a vertical beate r spreader to apply solid manure. This equipment would be able to apply pen manure at a consistent rate of 4 to 10 ton/A but may struggle to apply poultry manure at a 1 -1.5 ton/A rate - especially on rolling hills where the delivery of manure to the beater s would be inconsistent. Many operations will not rent low -rate application equipment due to the added cost of manure application, particularly when they have viable spreading equipment on the farm. (2) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup considered this comment and doesn't disagree, but the workgroup recommends that the P -Banking portion be eliminated from Option 1 of NBS development. Issue Comment 5 - Phosphorus Banking Comment P Banking is an important tool for NBS development where fields do not have excessive (+200 ppm) P. It allows for a conservative plan (conservative in manure application rates and setbacks) to be developed at a lower cost to the producer. It should not relieve the producer from their soil testi ng responsibilities and fields with soil test phosphorus in excess of 200 ppm should not be allowed to use P banking. (2) Nutrient Balance Sheets and Phosphorus Management Summary of Comments Received January 29 , 2019 Page 3 of 8 Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The w orkgroup agrees, if soil tests are below 200 ppm P they can apply more than required P, thr ough Option 2 (N -Based planning). If soil tests are available and gre ater than 200 ppm, then Option 3 (P -Index ) is required . The workgroup recommends that the P -Banking portion be eliminated from Option 1 of NBS development. Issue Comment 6 - Phosphorus Banking Comment The water quality benefits to NBS development and implementation are being maximized by using the Phosphorus Index for NBS development. We feel that Option 1 can provide a similar return, with a few tweaks. If any of the NBS options are to be eliminated, we would prefer Option 2 be eliminated. (2) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The proposal was not t o eliminate option 1 from NBS development but to ONLY eliminate the P Banking portion of Option 1 . Issue Comment 7 - Phosphorus Banking Comment Commentator understands the SCC's concern but have run into the situations where soil tests are not available, for a variety of reasons, and would encourage the P Banking still be allowed for these situations. (3) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The w orkgroup felt this comment was valid for the transition period when P - Banking was allowe d, but it has been known for years that soil tests were /are required. The workgroup recommends that the P -Banking portion be eliminate from Option 1 of NBS development. Issue Comment 8 - Phosphorus Banking Comment It should be noted that P Banking does not always necessarily fit the crop rotation in which it was planned. Example would be using P Banking for Corn Grain in year one, years 2 and 3 assume corn grain again, but the 2nd and 3rd years could be soybeans, or some other crops (3) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup recommends that the P -Banking portion be eliminated from Option 1 of NBS development. Issue Comment 9 - Phosphorus Banking Comment I have witnessed the complexity of the Nutrient Balance Sheets and soil sampling requirements become a \"deal -breaker\" for importing operations. This limits the outlets for manure and results in a time -consuming search for a new export situation. (4) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The proposal was not to eliminate option 1 from NBS but to ONLY eliminate the P Banking portion of Option 1 . Nutrient Balance Sheets and Phosphorus Management Summary of Comments Received January 29 , 2019 Page 4 of 8 Issue Comment 10 - Phosphorus Index Comment I don't like the idea of requiring a Volunteer NMP for importers requiring Phosphorous Index. As the process of importing manure gets more complicated, importers will say \"Count me out. I will just buy commercial fertilizer.\" That will make finding a home for excess manure more complicated. (1 , 3) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup agrees and does not recommend the Voluntary NMP option . Issue Comment 1 1 - Phosphorus Index Comment As a Plan writer, I don't think I want Option 3 in a separate planning tool, apart from Options 1 & 2. Splitting Option 3 into a separate tool is another step in the wrong direction. We would encourage you to take a close look at separate pages for Optio n 3 on the same Excel document. Right now, we are filling out input pages; when we are done, we go to the Summary page, and click on the Import button to import that information into the Summary Page. I think you should be able to have separate input pag e for Option 1 & 2 vs Option 3; then when you click on the import button, it would import Option 1 & 2 information, then import Option 3 information after that. But all Summary information would be in one document, and when a Planner goes to print, it wo uld all be in the same document. ( 1, 3) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup is recommending that the next version of the NBS have the following: - Two separate input decks (One deck for Option 1 and 2 and one deck for Option 3) - One Summary sheet for the farmer or hauler/broker (combining both input decks) - Post crop grouping, to combine fields with similar application recommendation, etc., for ease of implementation Issue Comment 12 - Phosphorous Index Comment Develop Separate NBS planning tools vs. modify the existing tool for multiple input pages. Will multiple input pages slow down the processing speed of the program? One tool that does it all would be great; however, we still need grouping to reduce paperwork and complexity (2, 3) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup agrees with this comment and is proposing two input decks with one summary sheet. The workgroup believes that this will not slow down the Excel program that runs NBS. Issue Comment 13 - Phosphorous Index Comment Eliminate Option 3 from the NBS planning tool, requiring a VAO plan: a. This is not a feasible option b. Will the NBS VAO plan require separate board approval, or would approval Nutrient Balance Sheets and Phosphorus Management Summary of Comments Received January 29 , 2019 Page 5 of 8 of the NBS VAO plan be tied to the CAO/CAFO exporter's plan? c. Would a NBS VAO be held to the same standards as a \"normal\" VAO plan - does the NBS VAO now need annual manure analysis of their own generated manure and would conservation districts be required to perform site visits? d. This seems to be a long -term solution. PA, with multiple layers of NM regulation (Manure Management Plans, VAO, CAO, NRCS 590, CNMP, CAFO, etc.) should look to streamline planning options. Moving MMP requirements toward VAO, or re placing NBS with MMP would be a logical step. (2) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup agrees and does not recommend the Voluntary NMP option . Issue Comment 14 - Phosphorous Index Comment Post Gr ouping modification to the PA Phosphorous Index - Post Grouping would be great! Any way to have less paperwork and easier understanding by clients would be appreciated. This would be our preferred option for NBS development. The old NBS version 3.2 allowed post grouping in an easy, efficient manner. (2, 3) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup agrees and is recommending to combine fields with similar application recommendation, etc., into post crop groupings, for ease of implementat ion. Issue Comment 15 - Phosphorous Index Comment Crop Grouping : We strongly believe in the utilization of crop grouping for NBS development. This tool simplifies plans and thereby improves the ability for compliance and, as a result, provides a positive impact to water quality. Field - specific information is important, but often leads to thicker plans which increases the likelihood that plans will not be implemented / adhered to. Farmers operate a complex business, with many moving parts. Their NBS should not be one of them. Simplicity is easier for farmers to remember and easier for them to implement. We understand that, to some extent, the development of \"simple\" NBS is in the hands of the plan writer. However, without a NBS development tool that allows for easy to understand plans to be developed, our hands are tied. If a farm has 20 fields where manure is to be applied, and 18 of those fields can be managed with the same application rates and overall management philosophy, nobody (farmer, plan writer, plan reviewer) needs to see 20 lines in the NBS, when 2 or 3 lines would suffice. The extra paperwork does nothing to improve water quality. Increased complexity of plan development and the overall size of the document increases farmer frustration and resentment. This reduces the success of plan implementation and the ability of our farms to be compliant. We have used crop grouping extensively to write Option 3 NBS in the past versions of the NBS template (version 3.2 specifically). In version 3.2, the Phosphorus Index was a separate worksheet, allowing data entry of al l fields into Nutrient Balance Sheets and Phosphorus Management Summary of Comments Received January 29 , 2019 Page 6 of 8 the Phosphorus Index. This format allowed you to see which fields had issues and group fields accordingly in the NBS. All fields with no Phosphorus Index problem can be grouped together, as can fields with Phosphorus Index restricted applicat ions and fields where Phosphorus Index eliminates manure application. This information could then be easily transferred to a visual representation (map) for a quick and easy reference / implementation guide for the farmer which serves to increase complianc e and have a positive impact on water quality. Crop Grouping simplifies paperwork. (2) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup is recommending that the next version of the NBS have the following: - Two separate input decks (One deck for Option 1 and 2 and one deck for Option 3) - One Summary sheet for the farmer or hauler/broker (combining both input decks) - Post crop grouping, to combine fields with similar application recommendation, etc., for ease of implementation Issue Comment 16 - Phosphorous Index Comment Phosphorus Index as a Yearly, Site Specific Tool: The SCC webinar seemed to indicate that the Commission is viewing the Phosphorus Index as an annual tool, meaning a NBS using Option 3 needs to be updated every year to reflect the site - specific crop plans of the operation. Again, for simplicity, consistency and ability to comply, this is not ideal. Phosphorus Index should be a multi -year / multi -crop tool if we want to increase compliance and simplify management. Multi -year / multi -crop NBS is possible if NBS are developed around a rotation's \"limiting crop.\" Using this methodology, a NBS could be developed to last for as long as the farm management practices remain unchanged. For example, if a farmer raises 50 bu ./A soybeans, 160 bu ./A corn and 70 bu ./A wheat, the soybeans are the limiting crop in terms of P -Removal. A NBS developed using Option 3 manure applicati on rates would then be based on soybean P -removal, thus assuring manure applied at that same rate to corn and wheat would result in a negative P balance and an eventual decline in soil P levels. The Phosphorus Index would not need to be re -run for the othe r cropping scenarios listed in the rotation. This is how our staff has successfully utilized older versions of the NBS template and our clients appreciate the consistency this approach brings to their annual management. (2, 4) Open Comment Period Discussi on Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup appreciates the comment, but for the P -Index (Option 3), planning is required for each crop and specific field. With the recommended two separate input decks and one summary sheet with post crop grouping, this comment can be addressed to a certain extent. It is unknown at this time how the revise d P-index will look and function, so we will keep this comment in mind, when developing the next generation of tools. Issue Comment 17 - Phosphorous Index Comment NBS version 3.2 met our needs for crop grouping and PI development. Consider Nutrient Balance Sheets and Phosphorus Management Summary of Comments Received January 29 , 2019 Page 7 of 8 an Option 3 NBS that allows Phosphorus Index information to be entered for all fields, then allows for calculated or manual grouping of fields based on Phosphorus Index results. (2, 3) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup 's recommendation is to combine fields with similar application recommendation, etc., into post crop groupings, for ease of implementation . Issue Comment 18 - Phosphorous Index Comment With the new requirements that came with version 4.3 of the NBS spreadsheet, the NBS is often as many sheets of paper as the Nutrient Management Plan and results in a product that the importing operation can't (or more likely, won't spend the time) to understand. Although developing 2 summary sections (1 for planners/districts and 1 for manure applicators) could help, it does not address the underlying problem of the NBS being too complicated. (4 , 5) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/1 8 The workgroup understands the comment. The workgroups recommendation is to combine fields with similar application recommendation, etc., into post crop groupings, for ease of implementation . Issue Comment 19 - Phosphorous Index Comment If the importing operation is not a CAO or CAFO, why can't the Manure Management Plan format for spreading rates be used? (4) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The Act 38 regulations at 83.301 require the use of NBS. Issue Comment 2 0 - Phosphorous Index Comment When needing to run the P -index, the current NBS format creates a very complicated summary sheet for the farmer to understand and implement. (5) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroups recommendation is to combine fields with similar application recommendation, etc., into post crop groupings, for ease of implementation . Issue Comment 21 - Phosphorous Index Comment Documenting the phosphorus environmental risks should be a stand -alone process used by the plan writers and reviewers. This information does not need to be shared with the farmer and included in the farmer copy. (5) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup understands the comment and will take under advisement . Issue Comment 22 - Phosphorous Index Comment Does it make sense to only have an Option 1 & 2 NBS spreadsheet and use stand -alone P-index and winter matrix spreadsheets like we used to do? If the results of the P -index require manure application adjustments, th en the planner would separate those individual fields from the crop grouping in the NBS and add a note saying that application rates in that fields are adjusted based on the Nutrient Balance Sheets and Phosphorus Management Summary of Comments Received January 29 , 2019 Page 8 of 8 results of the P -index or winter matrix. The map should show a highlighted color for those high -risk fields so the farmer has a reminder that those fields have a different application rate then the rest of the farm. (5) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup is recommending that the next version of the NBS have the following: - Two separate input decks (One deck for Option 1 and 2 and One deck for Option 3) - One Summary sheet for the farmer or hauler/broker (combining both input decks) - Post crop grouping, to combine fields with similar application recommendation, etc., for ease of implementation Issue Comment 23 - Phosphorous Index Comment We support either of the following: Develop separate Input & NBS Summary pages within the NBS planning tool Develop a component in the next version of the PA P Index that would enable \"Post Grouping\" and planning on crop group basis (6) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup is recommending that the next version of the NBS have the following: - Two separate input decks (One deck for Option 1 and 2 and One deck for Option 3) - One Summary sheet for the farmer or hauler/broker (combining both input decks) - Post crop grouping, to combine fields with similar application recommendation, etc., for ease of implementation Issue Comment # 24 - NBS is general Comment Reduce the paperwork associated with NBS to deliver a concise document to the client that can be easily adhered to and implemented. Our clients would be comfortable receiving the following information from us: a. Cover page and Importer/Exporter Agree ment b. Two-page NBS Quick Reference Guide c. NBS Summary d. Site Maps with application rates and setbacks (2) Open Comment Period Discussion Meeting 12/12/18 The workgroup understands the comment and will take under advisement .

Issue Comment 2 - Decommissioning Manure Storage Comment Suggest that the decommissioning of a manure storage structure, particularly liquid, be considered as a Level II BMP. I realize that a new storage may replace an existing one but often the older structure has some flaws or issues that are being corrected. I have had ca ses where the liquid system is not replaced. With the plight of the dairy industry we may see liquid structures unused and the farm converted to another purpose perhaps some credit should be given for removing a storage structure.

Schneider Director, Nutrient and Odor Management Programs Karl Dymond Odor Management Coordinator THROUGH: Karl G. Brown Executive Secretary, State Conservation Commission REFERENCE: Odor Management Program - Vegetative Buffer Standard The State Conservation Commission (SCC) and the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) have developed an Odor Management (OM) Vegetative Buffer Standard. Vegetative Buffers are plantings of grasses, trees and/or shrubs that are strategically located around animal housing facilities and/or manure storage facilities on poultry and livestock operations. V egetative Buffers filter and trap dust, odor, particulate matter, an d ammonia from the odor plume. Vegetative Buffers also serve as a means of disruption of the odor plume. This allows heavier odorous molecules and odor -carrying material to settle out in a reas of decreased air velocity and 'dead spots'. Lighter molecules may lift up and away. Vegetative Buffers are considered Level II Odor Best Management Practices (Odor BMPs). Since the Odor Management Program was established, the SCC looked to the Soil and Water Technical Guide(eFOTG) maintained by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and utilizes the eFOTG standard and specifications for buffers, etc. Seeing that the eFOTG is based on soil and water and t he buffers needed for OM are s imilar, but also somewhat different, SCC and PSU staff believes a standalone Vegetative Buffer Standard for Odor Management is warranted . The OM Vegetative Standard was developed in order to provide consistent program guidance to be utilized in the develo pment, review, and implementation of odor management plans. T he SCC standard incorporates concepts of the USDA NRCS eFOTG conservation practice standards for Windbreak Shelterbelt (380) and Hedgerow Plantings (422). The mai n audience for this standard consists of those Pennsylvania certified odor management specialists who will be developing, reviewing, or assisting with implementing plans to meet the requirements and intent of Pennsylvania's Act 38 Odor Management program. The secondary audience would be Operators that need to implement their plans . The proposed vegetative buffer standard includes: a. Overview b. Design Plans and Specification c. Implementation Specification d. Operation and Maintenance specifications e. Design - Plant Material Selection f. Example OMP g. References Attached you will find a draft of the OM vegetative buffer standard for your review. The NMAB passed a motion to recommend approval of the Vegetative Buffer Standard at their January 17, 2019 meeting . At this time, SCC staff is asking for an approval action ATTACHMENTS: - Draft SCC Vegetative Buffer Standard 1 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania State Conservati on Commission Odor Management Program March 2019 LEVEL II ODOR B EST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP) GUIDE FOR VEGETATIVE BUFFER ESTABLISHMENT I. OVERVIEW Vegetative Buffers are plantings of grasses, trees and/or shrubs that are strategically placed around animal housing facilities and/or manure storage facilities on poultry and livestock operations for different purposes . When designed to reduce odor transport through filtering and buffering, Vegetative Buffers are considered Level II Odor Best Management Practices (Odor BMPs) and are specifically established to address potential odors from the animal housing facilities and manure storag e facilities being evaluated in an Act 38 Odor Management Plan (OMP). Additionally, when used for their Visual Screening capacity, Vegetative Buffers may be located along property lines, or other locations on the poultry or livestock operation. Vegetativ e Buffers filter and trap dust, odor, particulate matter, and ammonia from the odor plume. When used for their Vegetative Bio -Filtering and Windbreak capacities , Vegetative Buffers serve as a means of d isruption of the odor plume. This allows heavier odorous molecules and odor -carrying material to settle out in areas of decreased air velocity and 'dead spots'. Lighter molecules may lift up and away. Turbulence allows fresh air from above to mix with odorous air, diluting the concentration of odorous molecules toward or below odor detection thresholds. Vegetative Filtering and Buffering Concept - Vegetative Buffers , when used for their Vegetative Bio- Filtering and Windbreak capacit ies, are plantings of multiple rows of grasses, trees and/or shrubs that are strategically located around animal housing facilities and /or manure storage facilities on poultry and livestock operations. This active filtering helps to reduce the odor transport. Visual Screening Concept - Vegetative Buffers, when used for their Visual Screening capacity, are plantings of single or multiple rows of grasses, trees and/or shrubs . Attractive trees and shrubs visually screen farm management activities and can serve as landscape plants to beauti fy the barn and farm. Research concludes that farms judged as \"attractive\" have fewer odor complaints. 2 Figure 1. Vegetative Filtering & Screening Vegetative Buffers have a direct impact on odor transport and odor perception in the odor generation -transport -perception continuum . Additionally, Vegetative Buffers can provide other useful benefits for the farm setting such as: Slow and buffer roof , road / lane , and barnyard runoff in addition to filtering nutrients and sediment. Protect animal housing facilities from winter winds . Act as a living snow fence by strategically depositing snow in acceptable locations . During hot we ather, shade trees block solar load on barns, improving animal comfort and reducing energy expense . Trees provide nesting habitat for wild birds and ground level habitat for wild animals . When grown for Biomass, can be harvested and used as animal bedding or combusted as a renewable, carbon -neutral source of heat for animal housing facilities . This odor management guide is consistent with the general criteria of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS ) Field Office Technical Guide (Pa Tech Guide) conservation practice standards for Windbreak/Shelterbelt Establishment (380) and Hedgerow Planting (422). Additional purposes and design criteria for these practices may need to be met for funding site -specif ic installations to meet the conservation goals and objectives of the operation. Filter Strips (393) and Riparian Forest Buffers (391) practices are other common vegetative buffers to consider in designing a holistic treatment of air and water pollution an d providing shade, biomass, and habitat.

For selecting woody plants suitable for placing general purpose Vegetative Buffers in most places on a poultry operation, refer to 'Windbreak Plant Species for Odor Management around Poultry Production Facilities', USDA MD PMC Technical Note 1(2007). For grasses, trees, and shrubs with best survival results when placed in front o f poultry facility exhaust fans, refer to 'Plants Tolerant of Poultry House Emissions in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed' USDA MD PMC (2015). LOCATION & LAYOUT Figure 2. Example Location & Layout Map Location & Layout Map. A Location & Layout Map must be included to visually show where the Vegetative Buffer will be located and how it will be laid out. Alternatively, this information can be added to the Odor Management Plan (OMP) Site Map, provided that all of the required i nformation can easily be seen and interpreted . Design Plans & Specifications 4 | P a g e Level II Odor BMP Guide for Vegetative Buffers Establishment PA SCC March 2019 Effectiveness for intercepting particulates and odors improves when rows are oriented perpendicular to prevailing winds. Wider (deeper) and taller plantings are more effective than narrower, shorter ones. Rows positioned closer to the odor source, e.g. poultry house, manure storage facility, etc., contain or limit dispersion of more emissions than those further away. Long, uninterrupted rows (at least 10 times as long as high) are more effective than shorter ones with gaps. The closer the row is located to the odor source, e.g. poultry house, manure storage facility, etc., the more effectively the odor and dust will be trapped and dispersed. Particulate trapping efficiencies may be significantly reduced beyond 100 feet, depending on height of trees, wind speed/direction, and atmospheric conditions. Proximity of the plants for trapping efficiency must be balanced with plant survival, which decreases the closer the plants are to the ventilation fans. A. VEGETATIVE FILTERING To reduce odor transport, the vegetative buffer must be situated so that the odor plume (from a concentrated source like the fans or manure storage) must pass through the buffer before reaching the odor receptor. In most cases, this means that th e vegetation should concentrate around fans or outdoor manure storage structures. A vegetative buffer expected to reduce odor transport must be at least 3 layers deep. The layers should consist of one row of fast -growing grasses or shrubs (positioned near est the odor source), one row of fast -growing deciduous trees or shrubs , and finally a row of evergreens planted furthest from the fans. NRCS practice standard Hedgerow Planting (422) is used for this purpose and location directly in front of exhaust fans. Refer to Conservation Practice Hedgrerow Planting (422) Fact Sheets for Trees and Shrubs for Poultry Houses and Warm -Season Grasses for Poultry Houses for specific instructions to establish and manage each type of vegetation when applying to NRCS for fina ncial assistance with establishing this practice for this purpose and location. Plant Materials Multiple row plantings (> 2 rows) should contain a variety of species to lessen the chance of loss due to species specific insects or disease. In multiple row plantings containing more than 3 rows, the leeward rows may be planted in groups or segments containing 5 or more plants of one species in a series to enhance wildlife values. See the Plant Materials section (V. Design - Plant Materials Selection) for info rmation on individual plant materials. Rows First Row Placement . Remember to account for changes in the site topography , e.g., you would not typically plan t in a depression. Every poultry house will differ as to the location of ventilation fans, access roads, drainage ditches, etc., so each planting design will need to accommodate these features. Where vehicle access is needed, locate the first row a minimum of 50 feet from the sidewall fans and 80 feet from the end wall fans of the poultry house. If th e house does not have tunnel ventilation and has a south or west exposure, use a minimum setback of 100 feet to provide for air movement. Plantings in fan impact areas. For plant survival in fan impact areas, the nearest row of plantings must be set back from the fans by a distance that is at least 10 times the exhaust fan Design Plans & Specifications 5 | P a g e Level II Odor BMP Guide for Vegetative Buffers Establishment PA SCC March 2019 diameter. (For example, if the ventilation fan has a diameter of 4 feet, then the first line of plants needs to be planted at least 40 feet away.) Where multiple fans are used in one location, this planting distance formula may be increased a minimum of 5 feet for each fan, depending on the number of fans that are likely to be running at the same time (e.g., bank of two 4 -ft. diameter fans may need a 50 -foot setback, four fans may need a 60-foot setback, etc.). Length of Rows . Length of the buffer should be a minimum of 10 feet longer , at each end, then the odor source. For a single 48 -inch sidewall fan, the buffer should be 24 -feet long, centered at the mid-point of the fan. For a bank of fans spanning the entire end of a 40 -foot building, the buffer should be 60 feet long. All individual fans and fan banks must be fitted with a vegetative buffer to meet the requirements of this standard . Spacing Between Rows Spacing between adjacent rows can vary or be uniform. Plan the between -row spacing wide enough for maintenance equipment to operate freely between rows. Usually this requires about 4 additional feet to allow mower access during the establishment period . Alternatively, Weed Control Barriers may be used, e.g. landscape fabric and woody mulch, etc. Maximum between -row spacing should depend on site conditions and planned vegetative buffer function but should not exceed 20 feet. Except ions to these between -row spacing include the use of vegetation as a living snow fence and when the landowner plans to remove every other row prior to excessive crowding. Row Types/Heights Spacing Between Rows Between shrubs less than 10 ft. tall 10 feet Between shrubs and small trees (10 to 25 ft.) tall 12 feet Between small trees less than 25 ft. tall 12 feet Between small and tall trees (> 25 ft.) in height 16 feet Between tall trees > 25 ft. tall 16 feet Between any wide -crowned s pecies and conifers 20 feet Between faster growing species and conifers 20 feet Spacing Withi n Rows Where plantings exceed the minimum number of rows , a plant -to-plant spacing of up to 20 feet in those additional rows may be planned for any appropriate tree/shrub species. Closer spacing's result in protection in the shortest time. Where appropriate, plantings with narrow spacing's can be designed with future thinning required to achieve the ultimate required spacing and density. Design Plans & Specifications 6 | P a g e Level II Odor BMP Guide for Vegetative Buffers Establishment PA SCC March 2019 Plant types at 20-year heights Spacing Within Rows Shrubs < 10 feet tall 3 to 6 feet Shrubs and trees (10 - 25 ft.) tall 5 to 16 feet Trees > 25 ft. tall 8 to 16 feet Vegetative Filtering Exception In the case of an animal housing facility that uses both side -wall fans and end -wall fans (tunnel fans), the individual fans (side -wall fans) may use less than 3 rows of plant material only when there are also 3 or more rows of Vegetative Filtering being used to address the end -wall fans or tunnel fans . B. VISUAL SCREENING Since the goal of visual screening is not explicitly to filter odors and dust, the plant material requirements are lessened. One or two rows of plant material are sufficient to visually enhance and beautify the facility. For year -round visual screening, use at least one row of evergreen trees . NRCS practice standard Windbreak/Shelterbelt Establishment (380) is typically used for this purpose. Plant Materials See the Plant Materials section (V. Design - Plant Materials Selection) for information on individual plant materials. C.

Implementation Specifications 10 | P a g e Level II Odor BMP Guide for Vegetative Buffers Establishment PA SCC March 2019 III. IMPLEMENTATION SPECI FICATIONS Containerized and balled -and-burlapped (B&B) plants are usually available throughout the year. The preferred planting times are in the fall or spring, but plants can also be installed during the summer months and irrigation must be used. Planting during the dormant period (winter and early spring) is also an option if the ground is not frozen. Ask your plant supplier for recommendations. The site should be flagged to identify exactly where each plant will be placed. A. Site Preparation Follow Conservation Practice Hedgrerow Planting (422) Fact Sheet for Trees and Shrubs for Poultry Houses and Warm -Season Grasses for Poultry Houses for specif ic instructions to prepare challenging sites along poultry facilities for establishing trees and shrubs. Remove debris and control competing vegetation to allow enough spots or sites for planting and planting equipment. Prepare supplemental moisture (irrigation) materials for installation if required by trees and/or shrubs. Because vegetative buffers can take years to become large enough to reach full effectiveness, good site planning will establish the plants as soon as possible. It is recommended that p lant establishment occur prior to construction where possible. Good site planning and construction management will make efforts to leave soil undisturbed in the areas where the buffer will be established. Prior to establishment, the site should be limed in accordance with a soil test recommendation . Disturbed sites around a newly constructed livestock facility often have poor fertility. Soil quality remediation should be accomplished as far in advance of planting as possible. Appropriate site preparation w ill be sufficient for establishment and growth of selected species and suitable for the site. Perform necessary site preparation at a time and manner to support the survival and growth of planted species. Avoid sites that have had recent applications of pe sticides harmful to woody species. If pesticides are used apply only when needed, and handle and dispose of properly within federal, state and local regulations. Follow label directions and precautions listed on containers. Always check for utility lines ( gas, water, cable, electricity) before planting. Avoid planting on top of buried utility lines or under low -hanging overhead lines. Contact Pennsylvania One Call or Call 811 before you dig. B. Irrigation Installation of a trickle or emitter irrigation system is highly recommended for all plantings. Drip irrigation lines should be installed prior to planting. Grasses - Between rows of grasses, use \u00bd -inch polypropylene irrigation line with 0.5 gallon per hour emitters placed every 12 -18 inches, or 15 mil thickness drip tape with 12 -inch dripper spacing. Implementation Specifications 11 | P a g e Level II Odor BMP Guide for Vegetative Buffers Establishment PA SCC March 2019 Shrubs & Trees - For the irrigation line, use \u00bd -inch polypropylene with 0.5 gallon per hour emitters placed at each tr ee and shrub. A 15-mil thickness drip tape with 12 -inch dripper spacing may be appropriate for closely spaced plantings. C. Weed Control Barriers Weed control will be part of the required maintenance activities. To ease weed control, place a layer of landscape fabric/ weed barrier cloth over the planting area. Wood products, such as shredded or chipped hardwood bark, pine bark, bark chips, and wood chips, can be used as mulch around the plants, but will not provide long- term weed control unless more mulch is periodically added. Apply mulch to a depth of 3 to 4 inches. Use a minimum of a 3- foot wide strip of mulch in the planting row, or a 3-foot diameter circle of mulch around each plant. Black polyethylene sheeting (6 mil thickness) or woven plastic landscape fabric can also provide an effective weed barrier. Black poly is generally cheaper than landscape fabric and works well if trickle or emitter irrigation is also implemented. Be aware that woven plastic fabric can be difficult to remove after plants are established because roots will grow into the material. Additional drawbacks to these artificial weed control barriers include increased soil temperatures that may limit beneficial microbial activity, and the inconvenience of disposing of the materials when they are no longer needed. Treatment of the site with a pre - and post-emergent herbicide before planting is also helpful for controlling weed growth. Natural or synthetic fabric weed mats may also be used around individual tree and shrub plantings to suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture. Mats should be at least 3 feet square, or 3 feet in diameter if round, and installed according to the manufacturer's instructions. D. Temporary Storage Instructions for Plantin g Stock Planting stock that is dormant may be stored temporarily in a cooler or protected area. For stock that is expected to begin growth before planting, dig a V -shaped trench (heeling -in-bed) sufficiently deep and bury seedlings so that all roots are co vered by soil. Pack the soil firmly and water thoroughly. E. Planting Methods Refer to the NRCS Conservation Practice Standard for Tree/Shrub Establishment (612) for planting criteria for establishing trees and shrubs. Criteria concerning, planting stock, s tock handling, survival rates, planting dates and all other criteria for establishing woody plants are found in this standard . For container and bareroot stock, plant stock to a depth even with the root collar in holes deep and wide enough to fully exten d the roots. Pack the soil firmly around each plant. Cuttings are inserted in moist soil with at least 2 to 3 buds showing above ground. Plant Materials . Unless written approval is obtained from State Conservation Commission staff and documented in Appendix 5 of the Odor Management Plan, t he plant material must come from the approved lists in the V. Design - Plant Materials Selection section . All plant material options are proven to withstand dust accumulation and thrive near livestock fans. Implementation Specifications 12 | P a g e Level II Odor BMP Guide for Vegetative Buffers Establishment PA SCC March 2019 Rows sh ould be staggered so that plants in row #2 are planted -in adjacent to the gaps in row #1. See figure 3 in the V. Design - Plant Materials Selection section. Operation & Maintenance Specifications 13 | P a g e Level II Odor BMP Guide for Vegetative Buffers Establishment PA SCC March 2019 IV. OPERATION & MAINTENA NCE SPECIFICATIONS Perform the following actions to ensure that this practice functions as intended throughout its expected life. These actions include normal repetitive activities in the application and use of the practice (operation) and repair and upkeep of the practice (maintenance): A. Inspections Year 1. Inspect the Vegetative Barrier twice a month from spring until fall. Identify areas damaged by heavy rainfall, animals, chemicals, tillage, or equipment traffic, and any other areas where the vegetation is not adequate to achieve the intended purpose of the practice. Replant during the growing season. Years 2 - 4. Inspect the Vegetative Barrier monthly during the growing seasons. Identify areas damaged by heavy rainfall, anima ls, chemicals, tillage, or equipment traffic, and any other areas where the vegetation is not adequate to achieve the intended purpose of the practice. Replant during the growing season. A higher level of care is required until 3 years after plant establ ishment. Years 5 and on. Inspect the windbreak at least annually. Identify areas damaged by heavy rainfall, animals, chemicals, tillage, or equipment traffic, and any other areas where the vegetation is not adequate to achieve the intended purpose of the practice. Replant during the growing season. B. Maintenance Activities Pruning. Thin or prune the rows of plantings to maintain its function only after trees and shrubs are established. Refer to Use NRCS Conservation Practice Standards Tree/Shrub Prunin g (PA660), and Forest Stand Improvement (PA666) and for these maintenance activities. Fertilize . Apply nutrients periodically as needed after the first year, but only if needed to maintain plant vigor and at a rate based on soil test results. Protect from damage . Protect the planting from wildfire and damage from livestock, wildlife, and equipment, to the extent feasible. Refer to the NRCS Conservation Practice Standards Access Control (PA472) or Fencing (PA382). Weed Control. Control undesirable pl ants by pulling, mowing, or spraying with a selective herbicide. Replace woody mulch; reapply mulch to a depth of 3 to 4 inches. Refer to NRCS Conservation Practice Standards Brush Management (PA314) and Herbaceous Weed Treatment (PA315) . Irrigation. Provide supplemental water to plantings via a localized or drip irrigation during the growing season for the first 3 -years' post -establishment. Ensure irrigation equipment is properly working; replace components as needed. Refer to NRCS Conservation Practice Standard Irrigation System, Micro -irrigation (PA 441). D e s i g n -Plant Materials Selection 14 | P a g e Level II Odor BMP Guide for Vegetative Buffers Establishment PA SCC March 2019 V. DESIGN - PLANT MATERIALS SELECTION This standard includes four groups of plant materials ; Grasses, Shrubs, Deciduous Trees, and Evergreen Trees. Mixed Species Note - Since dust (particulate matter) carries odors, incorporating a mixed species of native plants in the plant design is encouraged. By using a mixed species of plant material, ther e will be a higher chance of the Vegetative Buffer filtering out the different sizes of Particulate Matter, i.e. PM 2.5 & PM 10, which in turn helps to disrupt the odor transport pathway. Additionally, incorporating a mixed species planting should provide for better plant health - more diversity equals a more resilient stand of plants, or at least minimize monocultures by mixing up the cultivars if you're planting a buffer of just willow, for example. Invasive Species Note - Invasive species need to be avoid ed! Highly invasive species examples - Ailanthus (Tree of Heaven) , Bradford or Callery Pear, Multiflora Rose, and Euonymus . Please refer to other plant resource sources such as the Invasive Plant Atlas of the United States ( https://www.invasiveplantatlas.org/index.html ) for more information. Plant Materials Selection Note - This section V. Design - Plant Materials Selection will be updat ed as more research and plan t species recommendations emerge. The below plant material recommendations are based off of research current at the time of the publication of this standard. Figure 3. Grass planting layout. D e s i g n -Plant Materials Selection 15 | P a g e Level II Odor BMP Guide for Vegetative Buffers Establishment PA SCC March 2019 A. Grasses Preferred Plant Materials Selection: 1. Warm Season (Miscanthus giganteus) does well to control odors but the risk for transport of this plant to a natural water body where it can displace native plants is too high to recommend its use in these locations. 2. Cool Season Grasses : Prairie Cordgrass (Spartina pectinate) Planting Methods Note - Use containerized plants (1 -quart containers or larger) that have well -developed root systems. Plants of this size will be able to survive better in the harsh conditions near the ventilation fans than smaller plants or seedlings. In ventilation fan impact areas, planting 1 -quart container stock in the spring, along with irrigation and good weed control, should produce the best results for plant survival and growth. Spacing Within & Between Rows - Plant the grasses 3 feet apart on center within and between rows, with a staggered planting arrangement between rows (see Figure 3). It also is advisable to use more than one species or variety of grass so that a single insect or plant pathogen won't devastate the entire planting. Table 1. Recommended grasses for planting near poultry house ventilation fans. Common Name Scientif ic Name Cultivar Mature Size (width x height) Remarks WARM SEASON GRASSES PANICGRAS S, 3' Quickest to establish, but not as stiff -stemmed as others on this list. 'Dewey Blue' has especially attractive bluish leaves. Do not plant Coastal Panicgrass on wet sites. SWITCHGRASS Panicum virgatum 'Kanlow' Vigorous lowland switchgrass, typically used for biofuel production. Especially good for moist soils. SWITCHGRASS Panicum virgatum 'Northwind' 2' x 6' Does not spread as much as other cultivars. Useful for planting closest to the ventilation fans if space is limited SWITCHGRASS Panicum virgatum 'Thundercloud' 4' x 8' Tallest switchgrass cultivar on this list. If using multiple rows, can be planted downwind of shorter plants. Also, can be placed at greater distances from ventilation fans due to taller height. SWITCHGRASS Panicum virgatum Timber Germplasm 5' x 7' Vigorous lowland switchgrass, typically used for biofuel production. Especially good for moist soils; lodges a little less than 'Kanlow.' Commercial availability of container plants may be limited. COOL SEASON GRASSES D e s i g n -Plant Materials Selection 16 | P a g e Level II Odor BMP Guide for Vegetative Buffers Establishment PA SCC March 2019 CORDGRAS S, PRAIRIE Spartina Common 6' x 8' Prefers wet sites (e.g., swales between poultry houses), but also tolerates dry sites and saline environments. Can spread rapidly by rhizomes, up to 2 feet in a growing season, to make a dense mat. D e s i g n -Plant Materials Selection 17 | P a g e Level II Odor BMP Guide for Vegetative Buffers Establishment PA SCC March 2019 B. Shrubs Preferred Plant Materials Selection: Northern Bayberry, Japanese Holly Planting Methods Note - In ventilation fan impact areas, planting 1 - to 2-gallon container stock in the spring, along with irrigation and good weed control, should produce the best results for plant survival and growth. 1- to 2-gallon container plants are recommended because they generally survive better in fan impact areas than seedlings or balled -and-burlapped plants. If the tree/shrub planting distance will be less than 40 feet from the ventilation fans, use at least one row of stiff-stemmed warm -season grasses in front of the trees/shrubs. Table 2.

Need male and female plants for fruit production. Fruits are attractive to birds. Tolerates partial shade. Plants may be multi - stemmed or pruned to have one main stem when young. Suitable for visual screens and similar uses. Not recommen ded for planting in fan impact areas . Tables # 2 - 4 Notes : 1. Height at 20 Years: Actual height may be shorter than the potential height on an optimal site , especially in fan discharge areas. 2. Growth Rate: Slow = less than 1 ft./year; Moderate = 1 -2 ft./year; Fast = 2 -3 ft./year; Very Fast = more than 3 ft./year. 3. Density: For an individual plant species, defined as the amount of space that is occupied by foliage, twigs, and branches and can be estimated by the amount of light that can be seen through the plant. Low density - 25-35% of space occupied by plant material (with 65-75% open space through which air can travel); Medium density - 40-60% of space occupied by plant material; High density - 60-80% of space occupied by plant material; Very High - more than 80% of space occupied by plant material. The overall density of a hedgerow is affected by the species selected, number of rows, and spacing between plants. 4. Planting Distance from Fans: As a general rule for plant survival in fan impact areas, the nearest row of tree/shrub plantings must be set back from the fans by a distance that is at least 10 times the exhaust fan diameter. (For example, if the ventilation fan has a diameter of 4 feet, then the first line of plants needs to be planted at least 4 0 feet away.) Where multiple fans are used in one location, this planting distance formula may be increased a minimum of 5 feet for each fan, depending on the number of fans that are likely to be running at the same time (e.g., bank of two 4 -ft. diameter fans may need a 50 -foot setback, four fans may need a 60 -foot setback, etc.). 5.

Required Level II Odor BMP: Supplemental Level II Odor BMP: Vegetative Buffers Vegetative Buffers are plantings of grasses, trees and/or shrubs that are strategically located around animal housing facilities and/or manur e storage facilities on poultry and livestock operations. Additionally, when used for their Visual Screening capacity, Vegetative Buffers may be located along property lines, or other locations on the poultry or livestock operation. Vegetative Buffers fi lter and trap dust, odor, particulate matter, and ammonia from the odor plume. I. IMPLEMENTATION Site Preparation Follow the NRCS Conservation Practice Standard Tree/Shrub Site Preparation (490) for site preparation guidance. Remove debris and control competing vegetation to allow enough spots or sites for planting and planting equipment. Prepare supplemental moisture materials for installation. Check for utility lines (gas, water, cable, electricity) before planting. Contact Pennsylvania One Call or Call 811 several working days before you dig or install the plant material. Location & Layout Map Refer to the Location & Layout Map for the placement (location) of the individual rows of plant material. Planting Methods Refer to the Plant Materials Chart. For container , bareroot , and balled & burlapped stock, install the plant stock to a depth even with the root collar in holes deep and wide enough to fully extend the roots. Pack the soil firmly Example OMP 24 | P a g e Level II Odor BMP Guide for Vegetative Buffers Establishment PA SCC January 2019 around each plant and water; repack any voids found from watering . Cuttings are inserted in moist soil with at least 2 to 3 buds showing above ground. Visual Screening , Rows A, B, & C. These rows are creating visual screening for portions of the layer barn.

Date: February 27, 2019 To: State Conservation Commission From: Roy Richardson, Dirt and Gravel Roads Program Coordinator Through: Karl G. Brown, Executive Secretary RE: Recommended Policy for Unspent Funds Under Old C onservation District DGLVR A greement (July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2018) Background - The Dirt, Gravel, and Low Volume Roads Maintenance Program (DGLVR) provides funding to conservation districts through a series of 5 year agreements. The current agreement (new agreement) covers the period from J uly 1, 2018 through June 30, 20 23. The previous agreement (old agreement) cover s the period from July 1 , 2013 through June 30, 201 9. Please note t here is a n intentional one (1) year overlap in these two program funding agreements that is explained below . By the fall of 2016, it became clear that conservation districts would have difficulty using all the funds allocated to them under the old agreement by the end of the agreement in June of 2018 . This was due mainly to the large increase in funding, from $4 million annually to $28 million annually. Districts appreciated the increased funding, but needed time to develop the capacity to properly utilize the funds. As a result, Commission staff worked with the Comptroller's office to obtain a one-year extension to the old 5-year agreement as follows: Conservation district s were given until June 30, 2018 to enter into contracts with eligible entities . Conservation districts were given until June 30, 2019 to complete the contracts. Based on the provisions of the DGLVR Program enabling statute, and Commission DGLVR P rogram policy for allocations, advance payments and reimbursements, a ll funding ($116 million) under the old agreements with conservation district has been transferred from Commonwealth 's DGLVR Program Fund account to county conservation districts accounts over the life of these contracts. Collectively, conservation districts currently hold $ 14.6 million (12.6%) that remains to be spent by June 30, 2019 under the old agreement . Agenda Item B.3 The DGLVR Program maintains an online GIS system that allows staff to track financial data in near real - time. As of 2/27/2019, t his system shows $36.2 million committed to active projects , of which $14.6 million (40 %) is from the old 5 -year agreement. Based on historical data and program experience, it is likely that significant portion of the $14.6 million under the old agreement will be spent by June 30, 2019. Despite that, it is also likely that there will be some conservation districts that will not meet the spending requirements. There are two ways that a conservation district could fail to meet the spending requirements establis hed by the Commission : They could fail to commit the funds from the old agreement to contracts. They could commit the funds from the old agreement to contracts, but fail to complete the contracts by the June 30, 2019 extended deadline. It should be noted that s everal districts have contacted staff about the possibility of requesting another extension of the old program contract . Given the fact that that the comptrollers have already worked with us to extend the existing contract from 5 to 6 years to allow for implementation of projects , staff does not believe this would be an appropriate request . Recommendation - SCC and Penn State Center for Dirt and Gravel Road Studies ( CDGRS ) staff ha ve met with the Policy and Planning Workgroup to develop t hree recomme ndations for the close out of old program agreements (July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2019). These recommendations include the following: 1. Conservation districts should be given until May 24, 2019 to enter all their contract information into the GIS system. Af ter that date , conservation districts that have not committed all their funds under the old agreement shall not be eligible for a new allocation (FY 2019 -20). These conservation districts may be eligible for an allocation in FY 2020 -21 if they meet the spending requirements at that time. 2. Conservation districts that do not have all their funds under the old agreement spent by June 30, 2019 should have their FY 2019 -20 allocation s reduced by the amount of unspent funds remaining in their old agreement . 3. Any funds that are not allocated to conservation district, as per recommendations 1 & 2 above, would be reallocated to other eligible conservation districts for FY 2019 -20. Summary - Ensuring that state funds that are made available to the DGLVR Program are committed to eligible , high quality projects, and that the se projects are designed and implemented on the ground in a timely fashion , is a high priority for the Commission and participating conservation districts. Program staff believe that the above recommended close out procedures and fund allocation process recognize the need for flexibility under the contracting process, while stressing our commitment to contract fund s and implement projects in a timely fashion. Agenda Item B.3February 26, 2019 To: Members State Conservation Commission From: Karl G. Brown Executive Secretary RE: Spotted Lanternfly Suppression Program and Pilot Program Update Additional information pertaining to this agenda item will be provided at our March 12, 2019 Commission Meeting. Agenda Item B.4Agenda Item B.6Agenda Item B.6Agenda Item B.6Agenda Item B.6Agenda Item B.6Agenda Item B.6 1 Governor Wolf's vision for Pennsylvania includes vibrant towns and cities with new development, opportunities in rural and disadvantaged areas, and a modern, interconnected commonwealth. Unfortunately, a fter decades of neglect and disinvestment, Pennsylvania is falling behind. More than 800,000 Pennsylvanians do not have access to high speed internet . Heavy rains throughout 2018 demonstrated vividly and tragically that our flood mitigation planning and in frastructure has not kept up, leaving communities and individuals throughout the state with massive cleanup costs, and few options to turn to for assistance. Our t hird-class cities , towns , and boroughs face blight problems that lower property values , limit new development opportunities, and discourage private investment. Businesses looking to relocate or expand in Pennsylvania struggle to find pad-ready sites to quickly build out new locations. Pennsylvania is not well positioned to take advantage of the manufacturing opportunities created by natural gas. Across the state , too many residents are impacted by contaminants from industries of the past. Many Pennsylvanians live in homes with legacy contamination issues such as lead, while others are learning of risks from recently identified contamination such as PFAS and PFOA. It is time to make sure Pennsylvania is a leader in the 21st century. We need to position all of our communities for success. We need to connect every Pennsylvanian to high speed intern et, whether you live in Sullivan County or North Phil adelphia . We need to protect communities from severe flooding and other natural disasters. We need to re build our neighborhoods and eliminate blighted homes and vacant industrial sites so we can build new manufactur ing facilities and businesses. We need to position Pennsylvania to take advantage of the natural gas beneath our feet, so that we build the next gener ation of advanced manufacturers right here in order to use our natural resources, not just ship them out of state . We need to provide these manufacturers and businesses the support they need to become more energy efficient and competitive . To achieve the se goals, Governor Wolf is announcing a major new infrastructure initiative, RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA , funded by the monetization of a commonsense severance tax. RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will invest $4.5 billion over the next four -years in significant, high -impact projects throughout the commonwealth to help catapult Pennsylvania ahead of every state in the country in terms of technology, development, and infrastructure. Encompassing new and expanded programs to address five priority infra structure areas outlined below , RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA projects will be driven by local input about local needs. Projects identified by local stakeholders will be evaluated through a competitive process to ensure that high priority, high impact projects are funded and needs across Pennsylvania are met . 2 High Speed Internet Access We increasingly live in a knowledge -driven economy, making access to high -speed internet essential to our daily lives and economy. Over 800 ,000 Pennsylvanians lack access to robust, reliable, high-speed internet. Over 520,000 of residents without access reside in rural areas and while another 250,000 reside in urban areas. Lack of quality internet access means businesses are not able to marke t themselves and conduct business online, our children miss out on learning opportunities , and health care facilities cannot share information with specialists. According to Windstream Communications, building a new fiber line can cost up to $50,000 a mile . Pennsylvania must make a significant investment in high speed internet infrastructure to connect every corner of the commonwealth . Connecting Pennsylvanians to high speed internet is the most meaningful rural economic development initiative we can undertake today , and succeeding will require a significant investment from the commonwealth as well as partnerships with the federal government and stakeholders. Although there has been recent pr ogress, like the commonwealth providing a $1.5 million grant to help connect 1,400 Tri-County Rural Electric Cooperative members, it is clear that we need a massive investment to make sure all Pennsylvanians are benefiting from advancements in technology. Additional investments by the state will help leverage available federal funding as well as significant private dollars. RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will provide funding to completely bridge the digital divide in every community in Pennsylvania, making Pennsylvania a better place to work, do business , and live. Grants will be available to support installation of infrastructure to bring high speed internet to every corner of the commonwealth . Funding will suppor t every phase of the process from feasibility testing to connection . Storm Preparedness and Disaster Recovery Critical Flood Control Infrastructure Last year was the wettest year on record in Pennsylvania, and modelling suggests that increased rain will continue . Communities across the state were impacted by record -breaking rainfall, flash flooding and river flooding across the state , from Philadelphia in the east and Allegheny County in the west to Bradford and Columbia in the north and widespread devastation in Schuylkill, Lebanon, York and Lancaster Counties in Central Pennsylvania, among others. A single storm in early August created more than $60 million i n damage to transportation infrastructure alone in the middle of the state. The devastation these natural disasters leave in their wake demonstrate all too clearly that Pennsylvania's legacy infrastructure needs to be updated to handle changing weather and new development. Many needed projects involve streambank restoration to restore flow and prevent future erosion. Other projects will be for floodplain restoration, which allows stormwater to spread out and slow down, so it can be absorbed into the groundwater, rather than flooding over streambanks. Additional critical flood control infras tructure includes dams, levees and flood walls. RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will provide funding for flood prevention that will protect against severe weather and save homes and businesses in flood prone areas across the state . RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will provide funding to help towns and cities prepare for flooding and severe weather , upgrad e flood walls and levees , repla ce high -hazard dams, and conduc t stream restoration and maintenance. 3 Helping Families Rebuild In the aftermath of severe storms and other disasters , homeowners who have in some case s lost everything need immediate assistance to begin to put their lives back together. While Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding is available to assist property owners recovering from events that have been declared a Major Disaster, and fundin g is available from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) for some smaller events, there is currently very limited help available for Pennsylvanians who experience catastrophic losses due to localized flooding or other severe weather events that wer e not declared a Major D isaster by the federal government. RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will establish a disaster relief trust fund to assist individuals who suffer losses that are not compensated by FEMA or other programs. Stormwater Infrastructure Across Pennsylvania, communities large and small are struggling to implement new federal requirements that they manage stormwater to prevent pollution from flowing into local streams and rivers. Nearly a thousand communities with municipal separate storm s ewer systems (MS4) are currently preparing to implement a Pollutant Reduction Plan to reduce discharges from their storm sewers into local waterways. While funding this new infrastructure is a challenge, it is also an opportunity to create local jobs to c onstruct and maintain green infrastructure that captures stormwater where it falls while also beautifying downtowns with rain gardens, parks, and streetscape improvements. RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will provide grants to municipalities moving forward with Pollutant Reduction Plans to help them implement creative solutions to comply with their stormwater mandates and transform their communities. Additional state funding will reduce the need for new stormwater fees, which have proven unpopular where they have been proposed. Additional incentives will be provided for communities that are working collaboratively with their neighbors to tackle the problem in the most efficient manner possible . Downstream Manufacturing, Business Development, and Energy Infrastruc ture Pennsylvania has always been an energy powerhouse. Our coal fueled the industrial revolution, our power plants keep lights on throughout the northeast. Over the past decade, Pennsylvania has emerged as a leading state in production of clean burning n atural gas, and we currently outproduce every state but Texas. The first decade of development has seen a rush to build wells and pipelines to take gas to markets where it can be used. In the second decade, we need to focus on making sure we capture the benefits of this prolific resource in Pennsylvania to spur manufacturing and drive job creation in downstream industries. Royal Dutch Shell is currently undertaking the largest development project that this commonwealth has ever seen in Beaver County north west of Pittsburgh. This is the first major project of its kind in the United States built away from the Gulf Coast region in a generation. When this ethane cracker plant opens early in the 2020s , it will produce millions of pounds of plastic pellets, the building blocks for everything from water bottles to airplane parts. To realize the full potential of this massive investm ent, Pennsylvania needs to seize the opportunity to jump start advanced manufacturing facilities that will 4 take the building blocks, and turn them into high value products, employing Pennsylvanians with well paid, family supporting jobs. To prepare for th is opportunity and assist existing manufacturers and businesses across the state to take advantage of the benefits of locally -produced natural gas to lower costs, reduce emissions, and power an advanced industrial revolution in Pennsylvania, RESTORE PENNSY LVANIA will provide funding for infrastructure that helps build manuf acturing facilities and other downstream businesses for the natural gas produced in Pennsylvania while helping businesses and individuals use more of Pennsylvania's natural gas in their homes, creating job s, lowering costs, and improving energy efficiency. Downstream Ma nufacturing: Pad Development , Business Development, Site Selection , and Energy Efficiency When businesses are looking to relocate or expand, they need move -in ready sites. Especially for larger manufacturers and company headquarters, pad development can be prohibitively expensive. Pennsylvania is a prime location for businesses, and we can make it easier for businesses to move and grow in the commonwealth. RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will provide funding to develop pad -ready locations in prime locations and areas ripe for development with an emphasis on downstream manufacturers and support for businesses . This funding will expand the extremely successful Business in Our Sites program which empowers communities and economic development partners to attract expanding businesses by buildi ng an inventory of ready sites. Approved projects can use the funding for any site development activities required to make the site shovel -ready. Sites can be previously utilized property or undeveloped property that is planned and zoned for development in cluding former or underutilized industrial, commercial, military, mining, railroad , or institutional sites or buildings. Getting Natural Gas to Businesses While we encourage business growth and downstream manufacturing, we also need to make sure that these facilities can become more energy efficient and competitive by tapping into Pennsylvania's natural gas resources . Manufacturing and industrial businesses that convert to natural gas from other energy sources can save 50% or more in their energy costs. As these costs are frequently one of the largest for energy intensive manufacturers and industrial companies, upgrading from traditional energy sources to high efficiency combined heat and power systems can significantly improve companies' bottom lines and make Pennsylvania companies more competitive. When combined with micro -grids, these systems can help manufacturers be resilient and self-sufficient. Since 2 016, the Department of Community and Economic Development's Pipeline Investment Program has provided funding to construct the last few miles of natural gas utility lines to serve business parks , existing manufacturing and industrial enterprises. The goal o f this program is to spur the creation of new jobs in the commonwealth while providing access to utility service for residents and businesses. Eligible applicants include businesses, economic development organizations, hospitals, municipalities, and school districts. RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will provide increased spending flexibility to ensure that more communities and businesses across the state have access to low-cost, clean -burning natural gas. RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will 5 also provide grants to help downstream business es install combined heat and power and micro -grid systems at existing or new facilities. Demolition, Revitalization , and Renewal Blight Demolition and Redevelopment Pennsylvania is a historic state with legacy infrastructure and hundreds of thousands of blight ed buildings - industrial, commercial , and resid ential . Blight hurts communities in many ways. It poses serious health and safety threats, costs local governments for enforcement and main tenance, reduces property values and tax revenue , and makes communities less attractive for investment. In former industrial hubs , long abandoned buildings can prevent the consolidation and development of parcels for reuse in advanced manufacturing . In third class cities like Reading, Johnstown, Erie, and many others that lost population over the last half century but are poised for a comeback, blight ed properties slow the turnaround . The legislature has taken important steps to speed the process for getting a blighted building back on the tax rolls . Leaders like Sen ators Pat Stefano and David Argall have helped expand Pennsylvania's response to blight. However, there a re still an estimated 300,000 blighted structures in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania needs funding for planning, demolition, remediation, and redevelopment of blight to build on the legislature's efforts . RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will increase resources for addressing blight by providing financial resources at the local level to establish land banks and acquire and demolish blighted buildings in order to create new development opportunities or provide new green space. The funding will b e administered by entities established by the legislature as land banks or demolition funds. Brownfield Clean -Up In communities across the state, underutilized and abandoned former industrial and commercial sites sit waiting for cleanup to unlock their potential as a catalyst for new manufacturing and economic development. Frequently these sites have existing infrastructure, historic buildings and close proximity to transportation that make them attractive location s for redevelopment and reuse . Revitalizing these locations improves the health and quality of life of our citizens and injects much -needed revenue into our local communities by returning once lifeless properties to the tax rolls . Pennsylvania's land recycling program has long been lauded as a national model for the successful cleanup of brownfields , with over 6,000 sites having been successfully cleaned up and returned to productive use. With the long -anticipated phase out of the Capit al Stock and Franchise Tax in 2016, which helped fund the program, there is now a need to identify funding to ensure that this critical work can continue. RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will provide funding to ensure the continuation of Pennsylvania's Brownfields program, ensuring that more sites can be returned to use for recreation , or returned to the tax rolls as commercial, residential, or industrial sites. Contaminant Remediation 6 In addition to remaining brownfields, many resident ial homes and neighborhoods still face issues with contaminants like lead and Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances ( PFAS ). Studies continue to find elevated lead levels in blood tests of Pennsylvania's youngest residents, a result of Pennsylvania's older housing stock, 70 percent of which was built before the 1978 ban on lead paint. Long -term exposure to lead paint can have dev astating developmental consequences including lowered - IQ, memory problems, and other neurological and behavioral effects . To help prevent the ongoing exposure of Pennsylvania's most vulnerable populations, we must redouble our level of effort to remediate lead pain t from homes throughout the commonwealth. There have also been recent discoveries of PFAS contaminants in numerous communities across the commonwealth, threatening the safety of residents' drinking water. The cleanup costs associated with addr essing these chemicals can be significant, and without the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Fund there are few funding options available at the state level . RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will fund expanded efforts to remove lead and other contaminants from communities. Green Infrastructure Pennsylvania has long recognized the need to invest to protect open space, address maintenance needs in state parks, preserve working farms, clean up abandoned mines and restore watersheds, provide funds for recrea tional trails and local parks, help communities address land use, and provide new and upgraded water and sewer systems. These projects help create prosperous and sustainable communities, protect the environment, add quality of life value that attracts jobs , contribute to Pennsylvania's outdoor recreation and tourism industries, and improve public health. Moreover, the outdoor recreational opportunities provided by our state's network of parks, trails, greenways, riverfronts and other open spaces are increa singly cited as an important factor in where residents decide to live and work, creating a major incentive to invest in creating these opportunities as a strategy to attract and retain the workforce that will power Pennsylvania's economy tomorrow. Howeve r, significant need continues to exist. Over 19,000 miles of streams and rivers do not meet federal and state water quality standards. Nearly 200,000 acres of abandoned mine land remain across 43 Pennsylvania counties. More than 2,000 working farms remain on county waiting lists to be preserved. Over 200,000 orphaned and abandoned wells pollute our landscape. There is a significant backlog of needed infrastructure work to fix deteriorating buildings, water and sewer treatment systems and trails and roads in the state parks and state forests. The legislature in recent sessions has recognized the need to continue the success of prior initiatives to address these ongoing issues, but no consensus on a new source of funding has emerged. RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will provide significant new funding to enable new environmental projects and new recreational opportunities across the state, including infrastructure and maintenance in state parks, creation and revitalization of new local parks, and funding for new hiking, biking and ATV trail projects. Transportation Capital Projects 7 Pennsylvania has roughly as many state -maintained road miles as New England, New York, and New Jersey combined and keeping our large system in a state of good repair requires continued investment. The American Society of Engineers' 2018 \" infrastructure report card \" gives Pennsylvania a D+ rating for the quality of its roads and bridges and a D for transit. A safe and reliable transportation network is essential for Pennsylvania residents, businesses , and visitors and improving and maintain ing this extensive multimodal system requires stable, sufficient funding. Increased opportunities for reliable modes of transportation help increas e opportunities for employment, expand travel options for students looking for educational opportunities, and increa se options to explore Pennsylvania's tourism destinations, all of which will garner increased economic impacts fo r every industry, community, and Pennsylvania resident. Now is the time to formulate the strategic vision so we are prepared to seize on the opportunities ahead - another Amazon -like employer, transportation technology opportunities , and economic develo pment opportunities, such as transit -oriented development RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will provide funding for local road upgrades , create new flexible funding options for businesses that need local infrastructure upgrades to enable development projects, and multimodal and large -scale capital projects for transit . PA Back Roads With more than 120,000 miles of state and local highw ays, Pennsylvania has one of the largest transportation networks in the country. This sprawling network requires continuous investment to maintain , and needs are particularly pressing for the \"four digit \" state routes, many of which have not received attention for too long. In addition, Pennsylvania has more than 25,000 miles of unpaved roads, about 17,500 of which are owned by local municipalities and provide access for the state's agriculture, mining, forestry, and tourism industry as well as more than 3.6 million residents. Maintenance needs for these roads have been significantly exacerbated by heavy rain throughout 2018 , which created over $125 million in flood s and significant slide damage to state -maintained roads and bridges. PennDOT's Engineering District 11 in the Pittsburgh area alone is working to address damage from over 80 active landslides, including many roads that have been reduced to one lane or clos ed altogether. Conservation Districts across the state that administer Dirt, Gravel and Low Volume Road Programs are facing increased need caused by unprecedented rainfall. RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will accelerate progress of projects to resurface, repave and repa ir four -digit roads and provide technical assistance and funding for dirt and gravel roads throughout the state. Business OnRamp When businesses look to expand, they frequently need transportation infrastructure upgrades to support the inc reased flow of traffic associated with the expansion . While the state is sometimes able to leverage our allocation of federal Transportation Infrastructure Investment Funds (TIIF), these funds come with restrictions and red -tape that prevent them from bein g utilized for important projects, such as where the roads surrounding the expanding facility are locally owned. 8 RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will create a flexible funding tool to enable capacity upgrades needed to support development where TII F funding is not available. Public Transit System Projects Throughout the state transit systems large and small are struggling to provide upgrades required to meet the shifting needs of residents, commuters , and visitors. In some instances, transit systems were built out decades ago and have not yet caught up with the needs of shifting populations . Elsewhere rural transit systems have difficulty funding needs ranging from new bus shelters to maintenance facilities for vehicles through farebo x revenues alone . In numerous communities, high priority expansion projects have been studied extensively and are ready to move forward. In many others, applications for infrastructure upgrades are waiting for funding to become available. RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA will support new capital projects at public transit capit al projects throughout the state. 9 PRICE BASED SEVERANCE TAX PROPOSAL To enable the RESTORE PENNSYLVANIA plan, Governor Wolf is proposing a reasonable severance tax which will be leverage d to provide immediate benefits across Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania remains the only gas -producing state in the country without a severance tax. With every passing year our st ate\u2014the second leading producer of natural gas in the country \u2014is losing out on the opportunity to reinvest the benefits of these resources to stimulate our economy and move Pennsylvania forward. The proposed severance tax will be price sensitive to the na tural gas sector. As producer profitability increases due to rising natural gas prices, the severance tax rate will increase as well. The following chart outlines the price -based tax structure: Natural Gas Price Range Tax Per Thousand The severance tax will not make any change to the natural gas impact fee. The impact fee has assisted local communities where natural gas is extracted to invest in infrastru cture, their economies, and the health and safety of residents. The price -based severance tax will result in the following effective rates, which are in line with other major natural gas producing states tax will only apply to wells that are subject to the impact fee. The following exemptions will be allowed: o Natural gas provided to a lessor for no consideration. o Natural gas severed from a storage field. o Natural gas severed, sold and delivered by a producer at or within five miles of the producing site for the processing or manufacture of tangible personal property. The tax w ill be effective March 1, 2020. DATE: February 28 , 2018 TO: State Conservation Commission Members FROM: Frank X. Schneider, Director Nutrient and Odor Management Programs THROUGH: Karl G.

Schneider , Director Nutrient and Odor Management Program s SUBJECT: Calendar Year 201 8 Nutrient Management Plan D ata Attached is the most recent Nutrient Management P lan (NMP) approval data for Calendar year 201 8 (up to December 13, 2018) . I would like to thank Kate Bresaw from DEP for developing this report based on the data submitted by the delegated conservation d istricts. The report shows that there are a total of 1,217 Pennsylvania farms that have NMPs approved for their operations. These approved operat ions have a net total of 228,296 acres under plan, which does not include the acr es of importing farms with developed Nutrient Balance Sheets (NBS) . The last report given to the commission was on March 29 , 201 8. This report, when compared to the 201 7 report, shows a decrease of 814 operations with approved NMPs, and a decrease of 32,725 planned acres on thes e farms. There could be several reasons for this large decrease that could include: -Report only details active NMPs submitted to DEP prior to December 13, 2018. 4th quarter NMP data did not need to be submitted until January 25, 2019 . -Quarterly reports are being transferred from paper forms (entered into an Access database) to the PracticeKeeper system. -This report has NMP data from both Access Database and PracticeKeeper that was manually combined. -Data clean up from the Access Database is occurring. All plans over 3 years are no longer active, so not reported, where in the past they may have still been reported. -There is a move from Act 38 NMPs to Chapter 91 Manure Management Plans.
