What's more, advocates of the Atkins diet report that it can improve or prevent health conditions such as heart disease and blood pressure. There are four phases of the Atkins diet; Atkins 20, Atkins 40, Atkins 100, and Atkins 120. Each of these four phases poses its own challenges. - Phase 1: Induction: During phase 1 (induction), you're allotted 20g of net carbs per day. This phase of the Atkins diet is intended for individuals who have more than 40 pounds to lose and people with diabetes. - Phase 2: Ongoing Weight Loss (OWL): During phase 2 (continued weight loss), you are permitted to have 40g of net carbs per day; this allotment of carbs is ideal for anyone who wishes to weigh less than 40 pounds. - Phase 3: Pre-maintenance: In phase 3 (pre-maintenance), your starting point is 100g of carbs per day. This phase is perfect for those who have essentially reached their target weight and want to get ready to meet their goal and maintain the weight loss afterward. - Phase 4: Lifetime Maintenance: The last phase (lifelong maintenance) of the Atkins diet allows you to stay between 100-120g of carbohydrates a day. At this stage, you're aware of how many calories and carbs you can consume while still maintaining the weight loss you've achieved by this point. Phase 1: Induction Atkins diet phase 1 features many restrictions for eating carbohydrates. Moreover, it is simultaneously the hardest phase to maintain for an extended period. Phase 1 serves to shock the system\u2014jump-starting your weight loss journey. The ultimate goal is to consume less than 20g of carbs per day. You will lose the most weight during phase 1 from the loss of glycogen stores and water. Benefits Here's a list of the benefits associated with Atkins phase 1. - More energy - Curb food and sugar addictions - Rapid weight loss - Clear guidelines Health Risks Admittedly, the Atkins Diet warns that dramatically reducing carbs during phase 1 of the program can lead to side effects such as weakness, dizziness, and headache.

During this stage, there aren't as many options for what you want to eat, so you'll have to target proteins and high-fat butter and oils to help reach your daily calorie requirement. Phase 2: Ongoing Weight Loss (OWL) Phase 2 is slightly easier to maintain since you can slowly but surely reintroduce certain carbs. Try to stay between 20-40g per day.

Is the Atkins Diet Worth It? The Atkins diet is worth a shot if you understand the implications of engaging in a diet with such a low amount of carbs over an extended period. If you have pre-existing issues with your kidney or problems with your blood sugar levels, it is best to consult your primary care physician prior to starting this diet. Additionally, if you want to lose weight quickly and your body can adjust to the calorie restriction, it is worth trying the diet to achieve your goals on a short-term spectrum. What Is the Importance of the Phases of Atkins Diet? Each phase of the [Atkins diet](https://www.athleticinsight.com/diet/atkins) is important because they build on one another to create a total transformation. The first phase forces your body into such a severe deficit that your weight loss occurs quickly. The second phase adds a little more carbohydrates and calories while keeping your weight down, the third phase continues to increase the foods you can enjoy on high fat, low carbohydrate diet, and the last phase maintains your goal weight which you should have reached by this phase. Which Phase of the Atkins Diet Is the Most Important? The first phase of the Atkins diet is the most important because that is when you will lose the most weight because of the carbohydrates restriction. This phase is also the most difficult because it's such a huge adjustment compared to what you were likely eating before the diet. You get within ten pounds of your target weight, and then you adjust your diet so that your body doesn't gain the weight back too quickly as you increase your calories from a very large deficit. How Long Do Phases Last on the Atkins Diet? The phases of the Atkins diet last for two weeks each, and it is usually centered around you reaching a certain weight. Once you reach your weight, you focus on slowly adding more foods and increasing your carbohydrates intake while also maintaining your desired weight. How Do You Know When to Move to the Other Stage on the Atkins Diet? You know when to move to the other stage on the Atkins diet when you reach your target weight for that phase. For example, after the first two weeks in phase 1, you gauge whether you want to slow down and gain weight more gradually or if you want to stay with the rapid weight loss for a bit longer. Once your body adjusts to the new diet and the low amount of carbs you consume, you may continue to move to the next phase as long as you're not suffering adverse side effects. What is the List of Foods to eat on Atkins Phase 1? The Phase 1 of Atkins is the most strict part of the diet.
