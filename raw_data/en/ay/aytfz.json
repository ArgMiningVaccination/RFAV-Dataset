Date 21st-25th of August 2023 Location Statens Serum Institut, Artillerivej 5, 2300 Copenhagen, Denmark Program [3rd International Summer School on NON-TARGETED METABOLOMICS DATA MINING FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH](https://en.ssi.dk/-/media/arkiv/uk/news/events/summerschool_17082023.pdf) (pdf) Course credits 5 ECTS credits Costs Academic 400 \u20ac, Industry 700 \u20ac, waivers for low-income participants. The costs include lunch for all five course days. Overview The summer school will introduce non-targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics with a strong focus on biomedical research and hands-on training in metabolomics data mining tools. The summer school is offered through a collaboration between Aarhus University, the University of T\u00fcbingen, and Statens Serum Institut. Goals We will briefly introduce analytical hardware, acquisition strategies, study design, sample preparation, and quality control. The main focus will be on working with state-of-the-art metabolomics data mining tools for preprocessing, compound annotation, and statistical analysis.

Form - 5-day hands-on intensive course - Assigned reading package - Active participation in class discussions and working groups - Course assignment in working groups Course requirements The summer school takes place as a five days intensive course. Prior to the course, the participants are expected to have familiarized themselves with the listed literature. It is expected that all participants are highly active in the workshops. On the final day, the participants will present their (workshop) results to have their performance assessed. Learning outcomes and competencies At the end of the course, the student should be able to: - Understand basic principles of high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry - Understand typical mass spectrometry data formats - Carry out data pre-processing using MZmine - Understand and apply metabolite identification confidence levels - Use and understand tools for advanced metabolite identification (e.g. GNPS, MS2LDA, Matchms and Sirius+CSI:FingerID) - Understand and use basic multi- and univariate statistical methods, e.g. PCA, and differential analysis - Perform a full workflow for basic analysis of a non-targeted metabolomics experiment, including data preprocessing, metabolite annotation, statistical analysis, and biological interpretation Prerequisites - MSc in natural sciences or related field - Experience in R, Python, or any metabolomics preprocessing software (e.g. MZmine, is of advantage Contact [maet@ssi.dk](mailto:maet@ssi.dk), [martin.hansen@envs.au.dk](mailto:martin.hansen@envs.au.dk) Registration Registration for both the online and in-person event is closed.
