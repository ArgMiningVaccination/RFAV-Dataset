See [Full Disclosure Here](https://aromatherapyanywhere.com/disclosure/) Meditation encourages you to quiet your mind, connect with your body, and focus on your inner self. This relieves stress and anxiety, calms the mind, and helps you feel more balanced and better prepared to face whatever the day has in store for you. It also improves cognition, focus, and memory. Meditation can take several forms. In its simplest form, you sit comfortably on a mat on the floor with your legs crossed. Try and do this in a slight-darkened room where you aren't likely to be disturbed or distracted. Rest your hands on your lap, close your eyes to avoid getting distracted by things lying around the room, and breathe in through the nose deeply and slowly. Focus on each breath as you inhale and exhale. Closing your eyes and focusing on your breathing is what will help you reach that meditative state so you can enjoy the benefits of meditation. How Aromatherapy Works to Enhance the Benefits of Meditation Aromatherapy involves the use of essential oils and aromatic plant extracts for calming and healing purposes. If you are new to aromatherapy, you may be wondering what are essential oils. These are natural oils extracted from various plants, flowers, fruits, roots, stems, bark, and other botanicals. The distilled oil contains concentrated compounds derived from the original plant they are extracted from. These compounds stimulate the olfactory glands, which then communicate with the brain's limbic system to promote a positive mind and boost physical health. There are several ways to get benefit from the powerful healing and rejuvenating properties of essential oils. These oils can be used individually or combined with other oils to achieve the desired effect. They can be dispersed in the air or used in skincare products, lotions, and salves.
