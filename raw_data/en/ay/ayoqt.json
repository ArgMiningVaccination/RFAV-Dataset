Senior Vice Secretary to the Board of Directors i COMMITTEE REPORTS Capital Committee - July 19, 2012 As reported by Ms. Emily Youssouf Assistant Vice President's Report Alfonso Pistone, Assistant Vice President, Office of Facilities Development, advised members of the Committee that he would like to address some open items. Mr. Pistone noted that the Office of Facilities Development (OFD) had completed its contract analysis in accordance with Operating Procedure 100- 5, and would be submitting the information to the Contract Review Committee. He thanked Joseph Quinones and Jeremy Berman in providing guidance in satisfying the requirements of the operating procedure. He then announced that work on the third floor clinic at 875 Manhattan Avenue had been completed, and the North Brooklyn Network was attempting to have a New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) Article 28 preoccupancy inspection on July 25, 2012. H e noted that the third floor will add 13 exam rooms for Medicine, OB/GYN, pediatric and Specialty Services, and each patient room is outfitted with a provider work station, overhead cabinets and chairs, exam tables are provided in exam room, as well as elect ronic thermometers , wall mounted diagnostic monitors, wall mounted diagnostic sets, electronic blood pressure monitors, height gauges and pulse oximeters. The third floor space will also provide for several clinical support services, including Point of Care Test ing Labs, Immunization Screening and Triage, Social Work, Nutritional Services and HIV counseling/Rapid Testing. Mr. Pistone explained that research of the decommissioning issue regarding the Roosevelt Island Power Plant is continuing, and Jeremy Berman continues to consult with the New York City Law Department and the Roosevelt Island Operating Company regarding HHC's liability with respect to any remediation responsibilities that are necessary once the current operating plant ceases operation on or about Dece mber 2013. He advised that he had submitted a preliminary draft outline of the issues surrounding last month's discussion of the Gouverneur modernization project budget needs, and will utilize the balance of the Board's recess to finalize that report, which will offer recommendations to address those and other issues that challenge HHC's construction program. Mr. Pistone referred to very brief discussion at the conclusion of the June 2012 meeting, regarding the Lincoln Emergency Department Expansion. He explained that the facility is requesting additional capital funding, Mr. Pistone also noted that the Johnson Controls (JCI) outsource contract went live on July 2, and all facilities have succes sfully implemented JCI's Work Order system, and the inventory tagging of all facility assets has been completed and shared with HHC contract managers. 28 HHC managers were transitioned to JCI as JCI employees, and JCI has transitioned over 500 HHC vendors into its procurement systems. Concluding his report, he wished members of the Committee a pleasant August recess. Action Items : Authorizing the President of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (\"the Corporation\" or \"Licensor\") to execute a revocable license agreement with the Staten Island Inter -Agency Council for the Aging, Inc. (the \"Licensee\"), for its continued use and occupancy of space to provide services to seniors at the Sea View Hospital Rehabilitation Center and Home (the \"Facility\"). Angelo Mascia, Executive Director, Sea View Hospital Rehabilitation Center and Home, read the resolution into the record on behalf of Arthur Wagner, Senior Vice President, Southern Brooklyn/Staten Island Health Network. Mr. Mascia was joined by Carol Dunn, S taten Island Inter- Agency Council for the Aging. Josephine Bolus, RN asked what kinds of services are provided. Ms. Dunn advised that the site acts as a hub for the Council to develop all sorts of programs that serve elderly citizens and professionals, and provides counseling to individuals in need of servic e. Mrs. Bolus asked if services are strictly for seniors ages 65 and up. Ms. Dunn said that services typically include individuals 55 and up. Mrs. Bolus asked if transportation is provided. Ms. Dunn advised that transportation is available through a member organizati on as well as through the access a ride. Mrs. Bolus asked what hours the services are provided. Ms. Dunn said typically nine (9) to five (5). There being no further questions or comments, the Committee Chair offered the matter for a Committee vote. On motion by the Chair, the Committee approved the resolution for the full Board's consideration. ii Authorizing the President of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (the \"Corporation\" or \"Licensor\") to execute a revocable license agreement with Atlantic Dialysis Management Services LLC (the \"Licensee\") for use and occupancy of space to provide chronic dialysis services at Harlem Hospital Center, Kings County Hospital Center, Metropolitan Hospital Center, Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center and North Central Bronx Hospital (the \"Facilities\") . Lauren Johnston, Senior Assistant Vice President, Medical and Professional Affairs, read the resolution into the record. Ms. Johnston was joined by Frederick Covino, Assistant Vice President, Corporate Budget, and J. Ganesh Bhat, MD, and Nirmal K. Mattoo, MD, Atlantic Dialysis Management Services, LLC. Ms. Johnston shared a power point presentation discussing dialysis services throughout the Corporation. She advised that appr oximately $24 million annually are lost in providing dialysis services, and added that there is not enough capacity, and patients are routinely referred to outside dialysis providers. She noted that aging equipment and infrastructure throughout acute and chronic dialysis units also presents issues with care. Ms. Youssouf asked approximately how many patients are referred elsewhere. Ms. Johnston said that it varies from facility to facility, but Lincoln refers at least one patient a month, and at North Central Bronx Hospital some patients have waited especially long times for appropriate treatment options to become available, sometimes occupying beds as they wait. Ms. Johnston advised that this agreement would be especially beneficial to reduce exposure to the cost of acute dialysis, the cost of care for patients who are uninsurable and to cover the cost of the attrition of staff. She noted that the vendor would increase capacity and provide more access to patients throughout the system. They would also be responsible for equipment costs and repairs, and there would be a modest revenue stream coming in the form of rent over the nine (9) year term, from just under $380,000 the first year to approximately $1,700,000 by year nine (9). Ms. Johnston noted that Elmhurst Hospital Center has a similar agreement with the vendor and it has been a positive relationship. Ms. Johnston explained that the vendor would be responsible for fit -out, equipping and maintenance of the units and would be replacing most equipment that is currently in place. She explained that rent is based on Fair Market Value (FMV) fees and ranges from $40 per square foot to $54 per square foot. Mrs. Bolus asked how old the unit at Kings County is. Mr. Martin advised that while the space itself had been renovated rather recently and was in good shape the chairs and equipment were in need of replacement. Ms. Youssouf asked whether Harlem Hospital Center had not built a dialysis unit as part of their modernization project. Ms. Johnston advised that a space had been built out but equipment was not purchased and that is something that the vendor would handle. Ms. Johnston advised that FMV numbers take into account the location and efficiency of the space, and improvements that need to be made to the location, and that fair market value was used to ensure that all aspects of the Stark Laws were being followed. M s. Youssouf asked for an explanation of the Stark Laws. Jeremy Berman, Deputy Counsel, Legal Affairs, advised that the Stark Laws pertain to the relationship between two healthcare service providers where goods and services are being exchanged. The law requires that all transactions between two such providers be at fair market value to avoid the possibility that one of the parties is paying above and beyond the norm for some sort of benefit, such as excessive referrals. Mrs. Bolus asked how much oversight the Corporation would have over the outsourcing. Ms. Johnston said that the issue would be discussed further at the Medical and Professional Affairs committee meeting but advised that HHC and the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) will be overseeing, as well as each individual facility and central office. Ms. Youssouf asked whether the facilities being discussed already provided dialysis services. Ms. Johnston advised that Elmhurst has an active agreement with Atlantic Dialysis where a 24 chair unit is operated, and Bellevue has a unit managed by River Renal Services. Ms. Youssouf asked if the Bellevue agreement would be replaced by the proposed agreement with Atlantic Dialysis. Ms. Johnston said no, that agreement would continue through the end of its term. Ms. Youssouf asked whether the facilities being covered under this new agreement are currently providing services. Ms. Johnston said the Lincoln has an eight (8) bed unit that is operating under capacity, there is no service at North Central Bronx Hospital, Harlem Hospital Center has a small 11 bed unit that is operating but would be replaced by the newer, built out, 24 bed location that would be outfitted by Atlantic Dialysis, Metropolitan has an 11 station unit, and Kings County has a great space that is operational but overextended. Ms. Youssouf asked if the operations are simply being turned over to the vendor. Ms. Johnston said yes, the vendor will event ually pick - up the licenses that HHC drops and will manage all aspects of the services. Alan Aviles, President, noted that this agreement would increase capacity to perform dialysis treatment and services would be phased in over a three (3) year period while build- out and equipping took place. Mrs. Bolus asked if there would be any gap in services between HHC turning over the licenses. Ms. Johnston said no. Mrs. Bolus asked whether the vendor would be allowed to service non HHC patients. Ms. Johnston said technically yes but the units being turned over are already over capacity. Mrs. Bolus noted that HHC patients are frequently paying providers through Medicare and Medicaid, which may not be as financially beneficial as outside patients who would likely be using private healthcare to pay for services iii and she wants assurance that HHC patients receive priority. Mr. Aviles advised that the contract would include specific language regarding priority for HHC patients. Ms. Youssouf asked how the staffing would be handled. Ms .Johnston said that once the license is relinquished to Atlantic Dialysis the staffing will be handled 100% by the vendor. Mrs. Bolus asked about salary differentials between HHC staff and Atlantic Dialysis staff. Ms. Johnston advised that no HHC staff would be working in the dialysis unit. All current dialysis unit staff would be moved elsewhere. She noted that this is the same methodology that was used at Elmhurst and Bellevue. Ms. Youssouf asked about oversight. Ms. Johnston advised that there would be plenty of oversight to ensure the best care of the patients. Mr. Aviles added that a companion resolution to be presented at the Medial and Professional Affairs committee meeting would involve much more in detail discussion of the services to be provided. Ms. Youssouf asked that the discussion from that meeting be shared with the Capital Committee so that even though they are approving the real estate side of the agreement/relationship they are aware of all aspects. There being no further questions or comments, the Committee Chair offered the matter for a Committee vote. On motion by the Chair, the Committee approved the resolution for the full Board's consideration. Authorizing the President of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (the \"Corporation\" or \"Licensor\") to execute a revocable license agreement with Eyes and Optics (the \"Licensee\") for use and occupancy of space to operate an optical dispensary at Gouvern eur Healthcare Services (the \"Facility\"). Mendel Hagler, Executive Director, Gouverneur Healthcare Services, read the resolution into the record on behalf of Lynda Cur tis, Senior Vice President, South Manhattan Health Network. Mr. Hagler was joined by Avi Vizel, Eyes and Optics. Ms. Youssouf asked if this is a new agreement or a renewal. Mr. Hagler said that it is a renewal. Mr. Vizel advised that he had operated the optical shop at Gouverneur Healthcare Services for the last four (4) years, fabricating glas ses and selling contact lenses. Ms. Youssouf asked if the space is maintained or if there is any renovation work to be completed. Mr. Hagler said prior renovations to the space were absorbed by the licensee and they will continue to occupy that same space. Mrs. Bolus asked if the licensee would conduct screenings. Mr. Hagler said no. Mrs. Bolus asked if any work performed would go into a patient chart. Mr. Hagler said no, they are a completely separate entity. There being no further questions or comments, the Committee Chair offered the matter for a Committee vote. On motion by the Chair, the Committee approved the resolution for the full Board's consideration. Authorizing the a work order in the amount of $2,600,000 to the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY) to provide planning, pre- construction, architectural and engineering design services, construction management and project management services necessary for the design and installation of an automatic sprinkler system as required by the amendment of Federal regulation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). This request increases the previous authorization level of $25,501,000 to $28,101,000. Robert Hughes, Executive Director, Coler -Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility, read the resolution into the record on behalf of Lynda Curtis, Senior Vice President, South Manhattan Health Network. Mr. Hughes was joined by Michael Buchholz, Senior Associate Executive Director, Coler- Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility, and John Pasicznyk, Managing Director, Construction and Metro New York Operations, Dormitory Authority of the State of New York. Mr. Hughes explained that this increase would provide for renovations to patient areas where the sprinkler installation project is taking place. He noted that in prior capital meetings it had been discussed that with such an extensive and invasive project going on, that performing additional work to the site would be beneficial, and so it was determined that some light renovations should indeed be completed. Mr. Hughes advised that three floors within the facility had already been slightly renovated after sprinkler installation, and this increase would allow for the remaining five (5) floors to be completed. Ms. Youssouf asked what the light renovations would include. Mr. Hughes said painting all patient care units, replacement of ceiling tiles and grids, some floor tile replacement, and the possible replacement of nurse's stations. Ms. Youssouf asked whether this work would be performed in the building being decommissioned. Mr. Pistone responded no. Ms. Youssouf asked whether the requested increase would be adequate to complete the work being discussed. Mr. Hughes said yes. Mrs. Bolus asked whether relocating nurse's stations had been discussed. Mr. Hughes explained that relocating the stations would require much more work and significant cost increase. iv Mrs. Bolus expressed concern in not redesigning the layout if it would provide better service. Mr. Buchholz advised that nursing staff had been involved in the project design. He also advised that making any drastic changes could result in some of the newer codes for nursing homes being imposed and could complicate things. Mr. Hughes added that the time constraints with this project and the closing of the Goldwater facility are impacting what other work can be done. Mr. Aviles agreed that the tight timeframe for decanting Goldwater was very important and is tied to the sprinkler project. Mrs. Bolus expressed concern in not bettering the site while the space would be vacant. Mr. Aviles noted that the capital budget is already stretched but said that estimates could be provided to show how much the additional work would likely cost. It was agreed that estimates would be presented to show the cost differential between simply replacing stations and relocating them all together . There being no further questions or comments, the Committee Chair offered the matter for a Committee vote. On motion by the Chair, the Committee approved the work order. Authorizing a work order in the amount of $915,000 to the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY) to provide planning, project management and construction services required to replace the existing aged boiler and boiler house serving both Coler and Goldwater Hospital. This increases the work order authorization level from $2,943,325 to $3,858,325. Robert Hughes, Executive Director, Coler -Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility, read the resolution into the record on behalf of Lynda Curtis, Senior Vice President, South Manhattan Health Network. Mr. Hughes was joined by Michael Buchholz, Senior As sociate Executive Director, Coler- Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility, and John Pasicznyk, Managing Director, Construction and Metro New York Operations, Dormitory Authority of the State of New York. Ms. Youssouf asked for background on the project. Mr. Hughes explained that since the Goldwater campus will be vacated in the near future the current boiler plant, which services both the Coler and Goldwater sites would be decommissioned and replaced by a unit that would service only the Coler facility. The requested increase in the work order threshold would be used to coordinate with Con Edison the installation of new additional gas lines, high pressure steam lines, and also for asbestos testing and abatement. Ms. Youssouf asked what type of gas or fuel would be used. Mr. Buchholz advised that the current boiler operates using number six (6) fuel oil, but the new unit would be a gas unit. Ms. Youssouf asked whether this was the best option or whether the unit should be both fuel and oil capable. Mr. Pasicznyk said that current studies show that single fuel units are more effi cient. Ms. Youssouf asked whether this work order would cover the decommissioning of the old boiler plant. Mr. Buchholz said that the decommissioning study is covered but not the actual decommissioning. Mrs. Bolus asked where the new structure would be located. Mr. Buchholz said it would be located near the Coler facility. Mr. Pasicznyk added that some pre- construction work would be completed early on in the process so that when the time comes for final design and installation some of that work is already done, allowing the project to stay on the scheduled timeline. Ms. Youssouf asked if this work order includes the actual cost of installing the boilers. Mr. Pasicznyk said no, that would be in the final construction work order. He noted that the total project budget listed on the work order was $13.5 million and the current approval level is at $4 million. There being no further questions or comments, the Committee Chair offered the matter for a Committee vote. On motion by the Chair, the Committee approved the work order. Information Items Project Status Reports North Bronx Health Network South Manhattan Health Network Southern Brooklyn/Staten Island Health Network * Network contains project(s) that require a delay report With no active construction projects in delay by six (6) months or more there were no reports provided. Finance Committee - July 10, 2012 As reported by Mr. Bernard Rosen Senior Vice President's Report Ms. Marlene Zurack informed the Committee that her report would include three items, the City's Adopted budget; an update of HHC's cash on hand (COH) and the impact of the Moody's downgrade of fifteen banks. Included in the City's 2013 Adopted budget, HHC received $18.4 million for the majority of its restorations and $16.5 million in additional capital support. These are major accomplishments that are reflective of the City Council's support for HHC. v Ms. Youssouf asked if the additional capital funding is assigned to certain projects and if so what are some of those projects. Ms. Zurack stated that it is and some of those projects include: $2.5 million per CT scanners at Elmhurst, Queens hospitals; $2.5 million Staten Island Vanderbilt clinic; of unit 6C at Metropolitan hospital; $2 million for a MRI at Kings County hospital; and other small projects/items. Mr. Rosen asked if the $18.4 million included the capital funding. Ms. Zurack stated that it is not included. However, the Council also restored the subsidy cut for the current and a portion of the previous year. HHC ended FY 12 with 32 days of COH or $465 million and as of July 6, 2012, the COH increased to 35 days. As previously reported, next year's cash projections are extremely tighter than prior years. HHC has alerted the City and State of this issue and the State has agreed to accelerate some payments. Dr. Stocker asked if the projections are on a fiscal or calendar year. Ms. Zurack stated that the projections are for FY 13. Continuing with her report, Ms. Zurack stated that Moody's downgrade of some major banks includes some of the banks that HHC is currently doi ng business such as JP Morgan downgraded to Aa3 from Aa1 with an outlook of stable, short term P1 affirmed; Citigroup to Baa3 with a negative outlook; Morgan Stanley downgraded to Baa1 from A2 also with a negative outlook and TD Bank was not downgraded, curr ently at Aa2. JP Morgan is HHC's bank of deposits and also one of HHC's Letter of Credit banks along with TD Bank. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are remarketing agents for HHC's variable rate debt. The biggest impact to HHC as a result of this action is that the Letter of Credit capacity is reduced which has more to do with some of the other banks that have lost the ability to be Letter of credit that would allow banks to take advantage of variable rate debt. However, HHC's letter of credit with JP Morgan does not expire until 2017 and 2015 with TD Bank. Ms. Youssouf stated that given the constraints that HHC has in terms of the ratings on institutions per the indenture and State legislature, is there a direct impact on any of HHC's investments, remarketing agents. Ms. Zurack stated that in the past this was done but has not been done in years. Ms. Youssouf asked if it is included as part of HHC's deal with the banks. Ms. Zurack stated it does appear to be in terms of the deal that was done in 2008 which at that time HHC switched from auction rates to variable rate debt bonds and the roles were maintained as remarketing agents; however, currently HHC is backed by the letter of credit. Ms. Youssouf asked what the restriction on the rating is. Ms. Zurack stated that in terms of P1 versus P2, short term TD Bank and JP Morgan are both P1. Ms. Youssouf asked if that included the letter of credit which is long term. Ms. Zurack stated that it is a part of the contract term to provide the letter of credit. If those banks go down another notch, it would then become risky and could no longer be HHC's credit e nhancement. At that point HHC would be required to seek other options. The other risk is that due to the loss of some of the other banks that lost their short term high ratings of P1, there are fewer banks dong letter of credit which would mean that if there is a need to get a bank for that purpose it would be difficult and costly. However, HHC's contracts with those two banks for its letter of credit are far enough in the future that at the current time there is no major concern. Ms. Youssouf asked if the State is reviewing any of these restrictions given the impact at the various governmental levels. Ms. Zurack stated that it's not apparent at this time whether the State is reviewing that issue. Mr. Rosen asked how much is the variable rate outstanding debt. Ms. Zurack stated that it is in the range of $15 - $18 million. Mr. Rosen added that given that the contracts with those banks are long term, it allows HHC time to take action if necessary. Ms. Youssouf stated that the higher rates and the investments in banks have limits on the rating on long term on its institutions . Ms. Zurack stated that HHC is backed by treasuries, which is good and HHC's investments have been conservative and consistent with its s tatue. Key Indicators/Cash Receipts & Disbursements Reports Mr. Fred Covino reported that the Key Indicators report as of May 2012, utilization for acute discharges is down by 4.4% compared to last year for the same period and is a slight improvement from the prior month. The D&TC visits are down by 5.4%; and skilled nur sing facilities (SNF) days are down by 6.7% which has been trending downward during the year due to the transitioning underway at Coler/Goldwater hospital. The ALOS, all of the facilities are within the corporate average by 0.3 day with the exception of Coney Island and Lincoln, 4/10 day greater than the expected and 0.5 day less than the ALOS, respectively. The CMI reflects the transition this month to the new 2012 NYS AP -DRG model, whereby all of the cases were restated for the current and prior year thru May. The CMI is up by 4.5% compared to last year. Dr. Stocker asked if the variation in the facilities' current CMI compared to last year is related to coding and documentation or other factors. Ms. Zurack stated that an update on the coding issue could be provided to the Committee. Dr. Stocker stated that the update would be helpful. vi Mr.Covino stated that FTEs are down by 383.5 compared to June 2011 and down by 509 FTEs through June 2012. Mr. Rosen asked f or clarification of the 252 FTE reductions in central office as reflected on the report. Mr. Covino stated that it is related to the transfer of the IT staff to the centralized consolidated IT cost center. Ms. Zurack added that the IT staff that was previously transferred from the facilities to central office were move to the recently established corporate IT cost center. Mr. Covino reported that receipts are $2.5 million better than budget and disbursements are $35.6 million under spent resulting in a positive net surplus of $11.1 million year to date. A comparison of the current actuals to the prior year for the same period, total receipts are $262 million worse than last year due to the timing of DSH and UPL payments which are down by $225 million. Appeals and settlements are down by $33 million due to the FY 09 rate take back by the State Disbursements are $155 million worse than last year for the same period of which $67 million is due to the timing of City payments. Actuals versus budget YTD, total inpatients receipts are down by $27 million while total outpatient receipts are up by $47million; all other revenues are down by $45 million. Disbursements, personal services (PS) are $7.5 million over budget due to overtime expenses and the lag in the reduction of FTEs. Other Than Personal Services (OTPS) expenses are under budget by $43 million due to the roll of Networks' surpluses from last year and also the lag in the start -up of IT projects. Affiliation expenses are $10.5 million over budget due to a settlement between Harlem and Columbia Presbyterian, resulting from the termination of the contract. Medicaid Eligibility Inpatient Processing Report Status of Converting Self -Pay Patients to Medicaid Ms. Maxine Katz stated that the Medicaid eligibility report as May 2012 corporate- wide show a continual lag in application submitted compare to last year for the same period. However the gap is narrowing. Eligible decisions are slightly lower but the facil ities ha ve made significant progress in reducing the gap. The approval rate of applications submitted to Medicaid decisions is at 89.5% which is slightly better than last year for the same period at 88%. As reported last month, there will be some changes in the reporting that will link the payor mix reports with the Medicaid application processing. These changes are reflective of the request from the Committee over the year in order to provide a better understanding of the tracking of the performances by the facilities in this process. The reports will be on a quarterly basis given that there are no major changes in the data from month to month. Ms. Youssouf stated that the proposed reports would be an improvement in terms of understanding the relationship between the applications submitted and the eligible decisions. Based on the current data there is no way to determine if the process at any facility is better or worse. Additionally, it is difficult to determine the actual performance of each of the facilities and what the issues are in getting patients enrollment in Medicaid. Ms. Zurack stated that each facility is familiar with its issues relative to the Medicaid application process. The overall majority of the issues affecting the process relate to individuals who are afraid to apply for Medicaid in some of the immigrant communities such as Kings County. Commissioner Doar asked if the report would reflect the changes in the actual self -pay to the Medicaid enrollment increase and eligible decisions. Ms. Katz stated that report will show the number of discharges and the eligible decisions will be reflected. Ms. Youssouf added that as Medicaid enrollment increases, the number of individuals seeking coverage would decrease. Ms. Cohen added that the decrease would be due to the recertification requirement whereby many patients fall off the system due to non -compliance with that requirement. Mr. Rosen stated that PCAP continues to lag compared to the prior year. Ms. Katz stated that Corporate Revenue Management is reviewing this issue and the outcome will be report to the Committee. Dr. Stocker stated that the incentive for the facilities should be the impact of the process on the actual revenue. Ms. Zurack stated that the variations between hospitals is significant and Bellevue Hospital is doing worse than last year and will be reporting at the September 2012 Finance Committee on the status of their improvement efforts; the impact of the models and the Breakthrough events. It is important to note that the Corporation's ability to sustain the level of improvement is steadily decreasing with the increase in the number of patients who come to the facilities with insurance. Ms. Cohen asked if the data for prior years could be added to the report as well. Ms. Katz stated that it could be added. Mr. Rosen stated that the year -end reports would be done at the September 2012 Finance Committee meeting and the new reports would also be presented. Ms. Katz stated that the new reports would be done along with the quarterly payor mix reports which for the current FY 2013 would be in November 2012. vii Medical & Professional Affairs / Information Tech nology Committee As reported by Dr. Michael Stocker - July 19, 2012 Chief Medical Officer Report : Ross Wilson, MD, Senior Vice President/Corporate Chief Medical Officer reported on the following initiatives: Microsoft Care Plan Management System Contract between HHC and Microsoft Corporation for the development and implementation of a Care Plan Management System, including software licenses, a patient health record and support and maintenance was executed this month. The System will ensure that HHC meets NYS Health Home certification requirements and PCMH standards for collaborative care planning by supporting care coordination services for Corporation patients throughout the five boroughs of New York City. The system is a web- based, inter- operabl e tool that aids both patients and their extended care teams in managing and coordinating the medical and non- medical services and resources patients may require. Once implemented the Care Plan management System will ensure that HHC meets NYS Health Home certification requirements and PCMH standards for collaborative care planning. The term of the contract with Microsoft is for five years, and is renewable for two additional one year terms. The software license is perpetual and the annual maintenance and support agreements are auto- renewable. The total cost of the contract over the 7 year period is capped and will not exceed $16,100,000. The contract was successfully developed with the collaboration of HHC IT, Office of Ambulatory Care Transformation and Office of Legal Affairs. Hospital - Medical Home Demonstration Project HHC submitted applications for the New York State Department of Health Hospital -Medical Home (H -MH) Demonstration Program on behalf of our 11 hospitals on July 2, 2012. The H -MH Demonstration Program will make up to $250 million available over the next three years to NYS teaching hospitals to support transition of their outpatient training sites to Patient -Centered Medical Home (PCMH). If successful, HHC is estimated to receive approximately $28 million of the $102 million to be disbursed in the first year of the demonstration, based on a formula derived from Medicaid volume and number of primary care residents receiving training at our facilities. Award notifications are expected sometime in August and successful applicants will then be required to submit a work -plan describing selected resident training continuity of care enhancements, care integration initiatives, and inpatient safety projects. Continued funding will be dependent upon meeting certain performance milestones, including achieving Level 2 or 3 NCQA PCMH re- certification by December 2013. Contract with Microsoft for Care Plan Management System executed. HHC Health Home As announced last month the Health Home \"soft launch\" was initiated this week in the boroughs of Brooklyn and The Bronx with activities for both patients and staff. Announcement letters describing the new program and its services and providing instructions on how individuals should proceed with enrollment were sent out to 200 eligible patients and HHC Health Home our Warm -Line was activated and is ready to provide information about the Health Home Program to callers. Also, a second phase of training focusing on outreach, patient enrollment and care coordination processes was conducted for approximately 20 staff members from Woodhull, Kings and Lincoln hospitals. Six workers are ready to conduct outreach to the 200 patients we've notified and, given our experience in the NYSDOH Demonstration Program with a similar population, we plan to successfully enroll about 25% within the next 4 weeks. Sixth Annual NYC Peer Specialist Conference - Office of Behavioral Health Today, (Thursday, July 19, 2012) Joyce Wale, Sr. AVP, Office of Behavioral Health, provided opening remarks for the Sixth Annual New York City Peer Specialist Conference. This years' conference titled Redesign by Design: Healthcare Reform and the Role of Peers is focused on the ways that individuals whom have reached a point in their recovery can help others and become part of the treat ment team. Over the years HHC has won awards for our work in using Peer Counselors and most recently provided workshops on the use of Peers in discharge planning and as Health Coaches in our Keeping Healthy After Hospitalization groups. Office of Patient Centered Care There were two events recently focused on the culture change needed to improve the experiences our patients have while in our care. On June 27th we worked with the NAPH and three other safety net organizations on some facility -based initiatives designed to engage staff at every level, fostering respect for all. This collaborative will Continue through the fall, with teams reporting in their progress in experimenting with change. The second event was July 11th, when an expert from our new partner, Press Ganey, came and met with viii our senior leaders about their role and influence in fostering the real and lasting culture changes required. Discussions continue regarding next steps. FEMA Reimbursement - Hurricane Irene The HHC Office of Emergency Management recently concluded working with FEMA's Public Assistance Program to obtain reimbursement for expenses incurred in preparation for and response to Hurricane Irene. Expenses considered reimbursable included mitigation measures taken to prepare the facility for the hurricane, staffing for personnel assigned to the Special Medical Needs Shelters or performing hurricane related tasks outside of their normal duties, supplies and equipment provided to the Shelters, costs related to the evacuation of Coney Island Hospital and damage to facilities caused by the hurricane. HHC facilities estimated total expenses (OTPS/PS/Damages) to be $8,600,140 of which $4,165,000 was for damages to facilities. FEMA approved $2,805,896 in reimbursements of which $1,207,506 was for damages and debris removal. HHC will receive $2,455,159 (87.5% of the approved payment). Chief Information Officer Report Mr. Bert Robles, Chief Information Officer was unable to attend. His report was submitted for the record as follows. EITS is a Finalist in the \"Where to Work: Best Hospital IT Departments\" Survey HHC EITS is a finalist in the \"Where to Work: Best Hospital IT Departments\" survey sponsored by Healthcare IT News. The objective of the survey is to identify the top 25 hospital IT departments across the country that are the most desirable places to work - and the unique qualities that make them so. Of the 277 nominated hospitals, EITS is one of the 125 IT departments that have qualified for one of the top 25 spots. In order to qualify, 52% or 440 EITS staff completed a 67-question online survey. EITS staff graded their department across seven (7) categories: day -to-day work, IT team, management, hospital leadership, workplace culture, training and development and compensation. All of the finalists will receive a benchmarking report showing how well they ranked in different areas as compared to their competition. The top 25 hospital IT departments will be profiled in an October 2012 special report distributed by Healthcare IT News in print and also published on- line. I'll keep the committe e posted on how EITS does. Enterprise Single Sign- On (eSSO) and Self -Service Password Reset (SSPR) Project The EITS Corporate Applications team is working to complete deployment of Oracle's Enterprise Single Sign- On (eSSO) and Self -Service Password Reset (SSPR) tool. Estimated completion for all of HHC staff to have eSSO / SSPR deployed on their workstations is on target for December 2012. Presently eSSO / SSPR pilots are underway at all HHC Networks. Pilots generally start with local IT staff and then are pushed to designated users throughout the facility. These tools have been fully deployed at the Enterprise Service Desk. Corporate Appl ications regularly meet with ESD staff to provide follow -up regarding questions or issues encountered with user support. There are a total number of 505 pilot users and as of July 6 th there are over 2300 active users for these tools. Currently, there are 83 Core Applications on Single Sign On - with many more being requested to be built today. Corporate Applications estimates that once fully deployed, eSSO/SSPR will save HHC about $3, 558,000/year. Update on Windows 7 Encryption and Back -Up In April 2012 Enterprise Information Technology Services initiated a project to upgrade all desktop and laptop computers across the Corporation to Windows 7 and Office 2010. To ensure the workforce is familiar with the new features associated with this upgrade we are conducting a 90- minute mandatory orientation class which highlights the differences between Windows XP and Windows 7 and Office 2003 and Office 2010 prior to users getting upgraded. As of July 13, 2012 we have upgraded approximately 8,600 out of 33,000 desktop and trained approximately 11,300 out of 44,000 employees. Percentage wise this 25% of our desktop and employees trained within 3 months of this project. We are on target to finish this project on or before June 2013. In an effort to ensure HIPAA compliance and to protect sensitive data including ePHI from unauthorized access resulting from a loss or theft of a desktop, laptop, or any other removable media device, Enterprise IT Services also initiated an enterprise encryption project ix in conjunction with the Windows 7 project. To date we have encrypted over 9,000 workforce computing devices and have also standardize encryption on any removable media device. We also anticipate this project being completed by the 2nd quarter of 2013 which will significantly improve our security posture and lower or risk of any sensitive or protected health information failing into the wrong hands. Status of Enterprise Encryption of System Back -Ups As mandated by Operating Procedure 250- 16 and 19, the corporation backup policy includes a requirement that we encrypt backups for all systems containing electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and confidential information that are sent to off- site storage in event of disaster. At the present time, we are encrypting 862 out of 888 (business and clinical) systems which means 96% of electronic patient health information and confidential files are secured. For the remaining 4% (26 systems), there are a series of issues stemming from old technology and applications which do not support encryption to the Food and Drug Administration regulated software and hardware. FDA regulated equipment will not allow non- approved software to be installed unless it is first tested and approved by the FDA which can be a lengthy process. We are currently working with non- compliant vendors to explore different options, such as application version upgrades and architectural changes to their application, which will allow us to incorporate the backup of those systems into our Enterprise Backup Environment. Update on Networking Infrastructure Refresh Program In February 2011 the Board of Directors approved a capital spend of $25.3 million for a network infrastructure refresh program. This funding was to be used to upgrade and maintain the first phase of a five (5) year network infrastructure refresh program to assist the Corporation in accommodating application growth, increasing bandwidth for faster application response times and maintaining stability. This program is essential in order to support new initiatives and technologies such as a new EMR, Meaningful Use, Business Intelligence, Soarian, Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACs) and Data Center Consolidation to name a few. To date, Infrastructure and Operations has encumbered purchase orders totaling $20.5 million and is on track to spend the rem aining balance by end of Calendar Year 2012. EITS will be requesting additional funding from the Board of Directors for Phase II of the Network Refresh Program and has estimated that it will cost $40- 45m. One hindering factor to the progress to this program has been the readiness of the environmental requirements at the facilities (power and cooling). These physical and environmental dependencies have slowed down the program's pace. PC Refresh Program Update In December 2011, the Board of Directors approved $8.8 m in a PC Refresh Program. The Board requested that we provide an update as to the status of this program. To date, EITS has spent $ 5.2 million in PC purchases for the facilities. Storage Refresh Program Update Also, in December 2011, the Board of Directors approved $6.0 million for a Storage Refresh Program and requested that we provide an update. To date, a total of $1.0 m has been encumbered. EMR Negotiations Update We are currently in negotiations with two (2) vendor finalists. I expect to bring the new EMR contract to the August 1 st Contract Review Committee and to both the September M&PA/IT Committee and the full Board meetings. MetroPlus Health Plan, Inc. Dr. Arnold Saperstein, Executive Director, MetroPlus Health Plan, Inc. presented to the Committee. Dr. Saperstein informed the Committee that the total plan enrollment as of June 29, 2012 was 435,223. Breakdown of plan enrollment by line of business is as follows: x Medicaid 367,338 Child Health Plus 16,291 Family Health Plus 36,830 MetroPlus Gold 3,130 Partnership in (HIV/SNP) 5,827 Medicare 5,807 This month, MetroPlus added 2,190 members. Their largest growth was in their Medicaid line of business. Month over month, MetroPlus' membership in Child Health Plus has experienced a steady decline since the beginning of the year . This year, they have lost 12.6% of their membership in Child Health Plus. The loss of membership is attributed to their membership aging out and losing eligibility for this product. These members convert from CHP to Medicaid due to changes in financial status. Dr. Saperstein provided reports of members disenrolled from MetroPlus due to transfer to other health plans, as well as a report of new members transferred to MetroPlus from other plans. This month, MetroPlus added 154 new enrollees in Medicare, with the largest growth in their Advantage (Dual - Eligible) product. As Dr. Saperstein reported last month, the New York State Department of Health (SDOH) has provided a draft of the Phase 1 pharmacy rate change analysis. The total rate change for Medicaid in NYC was -7.1%. T he total rate change for FHP in NYC was -11.5%. For MetroPlus, this amounts to approximately three million dollars less in pharmacy revenue per month. The New York Health Plan Association has expressed ongoing concerns about the inadequacy of pharmacy rates. HPA questioned several of the assumptions that were used by Mercer, the SDOH's actuary, to develop the new rate. As a result, Mercer has committed to review the data again and to continue the discussion around the decreased rate change. Dr. Saperstein will continue to keep the Committee informed as discussion around this topic continues. The 2013 Medicare Bids were submitted to CMS on June 4, 2012. The MetroPlus bid is now in desk review with CMS. We expect to know if CMS will require material changes to our proposed submission by the end of the summer. Additionally, in the earlier part of the year, CMS identified the Plan to undergo a financial audit and we are in the process of preparing the data submission that is due on July 27, 2012. CMS will perform an onsite review in August. As Dr. Saperstein reported earlier this year, as of July 2, 2012, all Medicaid managed care plans will be required to cover dental services for their enrollees. The MetroPlus dental implementation is going well and the transition has gone smoothly. We have contracted with Healthplex to administer dental benefits for all our MetroPlus Medicaid and Medicaid SNP members. Also as of July 2, 2012, MetroPlus Family Health Plus, Child Health Plus, and Medicare Advantage members will have management of their dental benefits transition from DentaQuest to Healthplex. MetroPlus continues to work very closely with HHC towards the successful implementation of the HHC Health Home. The go- live date for the start of membership outreach is July 16, 2012. MetroPlus is ready to perform the initial mailing and route calls to HHC for handling. Currently, we are awaiting HHC's signature of the Health Home contract. We hope to have this contract signed in July. Mandatory enrollment for Managed Long Term Care (MLTC) began on July 2, 2012. CMS has provided the state verbal approval for this change, and New York Medicaid Choice has started sending notifications to approximately 500 recipients in Lower Manhattan. The MetroPlus application for a MLTC License was completed and submitted. Representatives from the NYSDOH will be onsite on July 10, 2012 for the MetroPlus readiness review. Dr. Saperstein anticipates that the readiness review will conclude successfully and MetroPlus will be granted a lic ense. This summer, MetroPlus will continue to meet with all network and facility leadership in regards to our strategic initiatives to grow the Medicare product. As of June 29, 2012, we have had three successful meetings in order to build the internal processes and systems needed to facilitate potential enrollment of the nearly 22,000 dual eligible patients in HHC. Action Item : Authorizing the President of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (\"the Corporation\") to negotiate and execute a contrac t with Atlantic Dialysis Management Services LLC (\"Atlantic\") to provide dialysis technical services to HHC patients in the fol lowing facilities: Coney Island Hospital, Harlem Hospital Center, Jacobi Medical Center, Kings County Hospital Center, Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, Metropolitan Hospital Center, North Central Bronx Hospital, Queens Hospital Center, and Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center. The contract shall be for a period of five years with one, four -year option to renew exercisable solely by the Corporation, in an amount not to exceed $83 million for the entire term of nine years. AND xi Further authorizing the President to make adjustments to the contract amounts, providing such adjustments are consistent with the Corporation's financial plan, professional standards of care and equal employment opportunity policy. The resolution was moved for the full Board of Directors consideration. Information Items : Patient Safety Update - FY 2012 Caroline M. Jacobs, MPH, MS.Ed., Senior Vice President, Safety & Human Development presented to the Committee. The targeted efforts in Fiscal Year 2012 included: 1) enterprise-wide strategic priorities in workforce development in TeamSTEPPS and The Just Culture and infection prevention and reduction; 2) medication safety; 3) assessment of staff perceptions of safety culture; 4) new Health and Human Services (HHS) Initiative - The Partnership for Patients; and 5) other activities . The workforce development strategic priority has been to educate and train staff in the following two critical programs: 1) Just Culture for managers - 926 staff trained in FY 12 for a total of 8,539 since FY 11 and Simplified Just Culture - 3,588 staff tr ained in FY 12 for a total of 16,939 since FY 11; and 2) TeamSTEPPS Master Training - 104 staff trained in FY12 for a total of 724 since FY 11 and TeamSTEPPS training 3,802 staff trained in FY 12 for a total of 11,875 since FY 11. The FY 12 strategic priorities around infection prevention and reduction were to: reduce the rate of healthcare acquired infections by 15% and a specific focus on central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSIs) and catheter associated urinary tract infec tions (CUTIs). The Division of Medical and Professional Affairs re- launched the \"Journey to Zero\" healthcare acquired infections campaign and tools such as TeamSTEPPS can be used to support HHC's \"Journey to Zero\" infections and other hospital acquired conditions and enable sustainment. Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center embedding TeamSTEPPS with clinical/programmatic work as demonstrated by the following achievements : Reduction in CAUTIs: 40% between 2009 - 2010; 80% between 2010 - 2011; and overall 98% between 2009 - 2011. Key elements to success included use of TeamSTEPPS tools and techniques including leadership, communication tools, situation awar eness, and mutual support; and interdisciplinary support. Lincoln CAUTI rates in step down unit (# per 1,000 catheter days) decreased from 5.88 in the first quarter of 2009 to 2.4 in the second quarter of 2011, then to 0 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Lincoln's urinary catheter removed on post -op-day was 82% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to 100% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Metropolitan Hospital Center as a result of implementing TeamSTEPPS experienced a 71% reduction in physical altercations from six (6) per month in 2009 to 1.4 per month in 2011. The enterprise- wide medication safety council focus includes: improving rate of medication reconciliation; improving anticoagulation therapy; and appropriate pain management and opioid use. For medication reconciliation the target is zero unreconciled medications. Percentage of unreconciled medications (per 100 medications) for the acute hospitals decreased from 10% in 2009 to 6.6% in 2011. The percentage in the long term care facilities decreased from 5.33% in 2009 to 2.9% in 2011. Improving anticoagulation therapy: the number of patients receiving Heparin whose partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was appropriately managed and monitored increased positively from 84% in 2010 to 94% in 2011. The number of patients successfully recalled to c linic after not showing for an anticoagulation related follow -up visit increased positively from 88% in 2010 to 100% in 2011. Ms. Jacobs provided the Committee with a sample of the facilities anticoagulation therapy resource guides on intranet sites. A Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services Grant supporting joint labor and management collaboration between HHC, CIR/SEIU , 1199 SEIU was obtained with the goal to improve medication safety, with a specific focus on opioids and pain management. Thes e funds supported or will support the following: November 2011 Conference: \"Improving Medication Safety Through Effective Teamwork and Communication\"; Six Medication Safety Grand Rounds for Interdisciplinary Teams at NCB/Jacobi, Harlem, Bellevue, Lincoln, Coney Island and Metropolitan to be completed by the end of September 2012; and the development of a best practice on opioids and pain management. Ms. Jacobs demonstrated the pain management pocket guide that was developed which covers: types of pain; pain scale; assessment and types of severity of pain; evaluation of pain and treatment/management options; and recommended opioid and non- opioid medications and dosages. The patient safety culture survey is based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and includes: hospital survey on patient safety culture; medical office survey on patient safety culture specific to our DTCs; and nursing home survey on patient safety culture. There are 42 - 52 questions per survey that roll up into 12 composites. Evidence- based tools are used to assess staff opinions xii about patient safety issues, medical errors and event reporting in their organization. The survey was available (electronically or hard copy) to all HHC employees, volunteers, and medical staff in all facility work areas from March 18th - April 4th. For the 2012 survey results, 23,415 responses enterprise- wide (61% response rate) was received. The analysis shows clear areas of strength and some opportunities for improvement based on the percentage positive responses to survey questions. Strengths are organizational learning - continuous improvement and management support for patient safety. Opportunities are non- punitive response to error and staffing. Ms. Jacobs provided the Committee with facility specific responses to the following four (4) survey questions: 1) we are actively doing things to improve patient safety; 2) mistakes have led to positive changes here; 3) staff worry that mistakes they make are kept in their personnel files; and 40 when a mistake is made but caught and corrected, how often is it reported?. The percentage of positive responses to frequency or events reported went from 57% in 2007 to 60% in 2010 and 63% in 2012. The Federal initiative from the Health and Human Services (HHS) \"Partnership for Patients\" vision of improvement is achieving the Triple Aim = better health for populations; better health for individuals; and lower costs through improvement. The two following goals are to be achieved by December 2014: reduce hospital -acquired conditions in the aggregate by 40%; and reduce preventable readmissions in the aggregate by 20%. HHC has been selected to participate in the New York State Partnership For Patients (NYSPFP) Collaboration between GNYHA and HANYS. The aim is to w ork with hospitals to achieve CMS' goals by building the organizational capacity for rapid and sustainable improvement. Over 170 hospitals across NYS (including HHC) have joined the NYSPFP. HHC hospitals are partici pating on all 11 focus areas through the NYCPFP are: adverse events; -associated blood stream infections; surgical site infections; preventable readmissions; injuries from falls and immobility; and venous thromboembolism. Other patient safety activities that occurred during FY 12 included: patient and family engagement; the patient safety awareness week large scale event was the Patient Safety Jeopardy \"Battle of the Networks\" which Queens Hospital won & the Patient Safety Champions Awards celebration; large scale education and patient safety forums - From Tears to Transparency: The Story of Michael Skolnik, TeamSTEPPS Master Trainer Update, and Advancing Pat ient Safety through Understanding Human Factors ; new curricula - Connecting the Patient Safety Dots: Bridging TeamSTEPPS, The Just Culture, Disruptive Behavior, and Breakthrough; and Annual Review of TeamSTEPPS and Just Culture; and collaborating on the revamp of the current root cause analysis process to a focus on harm reduction and learning. MetroPlus Health Plan Dr. Arnold Saperstein, Executive Director, MetroPlus Health Plan, Inc. presented to the Committee. Highlights of the presentation follows. MetroPlus Health Plan (Plan) has been licensed since 1985 in New York State as a Managed Care Organization. In 2001 the Plan converted from an HMO to a Prepaid Health Services Plan (PHSP) and became a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC). The Plan's lines of business include Medicaid Managed Care, Family Health Plus, Child Health Plus, Medicare plans, two Special Needs Plans (SNP) for the care of HIV+ members in Medicaid and Medicare, and MetroPl us Gold. MetroPlus' mission is to provide its members with access to the highest quality, cost -effective health care including a comprehensive program of care management, health education and customer service. This is accomplished by partnering with HHC and our dedic ated providers. MetroPlus' vision is to provide access to the highest quality, cost -effective health care for our members, to achieve superior provider, member and employee satisfaction, and to be a fiscally responsible, ongoing financial asset to HHC. MetroPlus will strive to be the only managed health care partner that HHC will ever need. This will be accomplished by our fully engaged, highly motivat ed MetroPlus staff. MetroPlus' values include: performance excellence - hold ourselves and our providers to the highest standards to ensure that our members receive quality care; f iscal responsibility - assure that the revenues we receive are used effectively; regulatory compliance - with all City, State and Federal laws, regulations and contracts; team work - everyone at MetroPlus will work together internally and with our providers to deliver the highest quality care and service to our members; accountability - to each other, our members and providers; and respectfulness - in the way that we treat everyone we encounter. MetroPlus governance: the MetroPlus Board of Director's report up to the HHC Board of Directors. There are five (5) subcommittees of the MetroPlus Board of Directors: finance, audit and compliance, quality assurance, customer services and marketing whi ch meet quarterly; and the executive committee which meets on an as needed basis. Dr. Saperstein also described the MetroPlus table of organization and the various departments within MetroPlus (Human Resources & Organizational Development; Strategic Planni ng; Chief Customer Officer; Chief Operating Officer; Chief Medical Director; Chief Financial Officer; and Internal Audits with a dotted line directly to the HHC Board of Directors). xiii As of June 29, 2012 the MetroPlus membership was 433,794. The table below compares membership numbers of June 1, 2011 and June 1, 2012. The primary areas of growth in the last year were in Medicaid, Family Health Plus, HIV SNP, Medicare, and MetroPlus Gold. Line of Business # of Members June 1, 2011 June 1, 2012 Medicaid 346,665 365,907 Family Health Plus 34,396 36,800 primary care perspective 54% of MetroPlus' members has a primary care doctor assigned at HHC; with 46% of those in the community. The goal of the community doctors, whenever possible, refer into HHC for inpatient and specialty care. In the last year, HHC has lost 2% of its primary care assignment to community providers. MetroPlus Marketing staff is comprised of 150 facilitated enrollment (FE) representatives for Medicaid Managed Care, Child Health Plus (CHP), Family Health Plus (FHP). There are twenty -nine (29) enrollment sales representatives for Medicare Advantage, and four (4) dedicated enrollment sales representatives (ESR's) for Managed Long Term Care marketing. MetroPlus marketing staff are located at HHC facilities, City agencies, CBO's, RVs, and Community Marketing sites. In 2011, 57,089 Access New York applications were submitted electronically to HRA, eliminating errors and increasing the efficiency of the Eligibility Department operations. The Member Retention Department was created in 2006 in order to strategically retain the membership enrolled in MetroPlus' Medicaid (MA), Family Health Plus (FHP), Child Health Plus (CHP) and Medicare lines of business. Member Retention's Document Collection Unit assists with the completion of new enrollments. 2011 member retention performance is as follows: MA/FHP = 70%; CHP = 83%; and Medicare = 97% (average membership retained monthly). MetroPlus' provider network has 14,977 providers as of June 29, 2012. The following table provides the breakdown per specialt y. Primary Care Providers (PCPs) 710 TOTAL 14,977 HHC PCPs have declined while our membership has increased, contributing to our access issues. 2Q10 2Q11 2Q12 HHC PCP sites 553 526 517 xiv MetroPlus' relationship with HHC is excellent. We have a c lose collaboration with HHC at all levels of the clinical and administrative spectrum because we work together in: a forward- thinking environment; mutual population served: low -income, inner city communities, many racial minorities with higher health risk profiles; and mutual achievements. The continued growth of MetroPlus and its expansion into new lines of business will allow for the capture of new populations while assisting HHC in maintaining their patient and revenue base. MetroPlus' financial arrangement with HHC is that: HHC assumes full risk for all members who select an HHC site; HHC assumes risk for all the medical care other than primary care when the member selects a community physician (that is part of the HHC Community Provider network) as their primary care provider; and MetroPlus assumes full risk for all members assigned to a primary care provider not affiliated with the HHC network and for all members in Medicaid HIV SNP and Medicare plans The benefits of HHC risk arrangement are: allows for th e alignment of incentives; improved outcomes and decreased utilization benefits both MetroPlus and HHC; an opportunity to maximize the percentage of plan revenue payable to HHC; and lessons learned from years of partnership will allow MetroPlus and HHC to successfully develop and operate an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) model of care. Dr. Saperstein reviewed the administrative cost comparison for all plans for all lines of business - MetroPlus' weighted average total administrative cost is $19.79. Dr. Saperstein then revised the 2011 budget. He highlighted that MetroPlus' total estimated revenue for 2011 is $1.4 billion and their administrative expense authority is $113 million which is a reflection of their low per member per month administrative costs. Prediction for 2012, revenue will hit $2 billion as a result of new NYS programs being carved in to them. The following table outlines the 2012 NYS DOH Medicaid Quality Incentive Bonus. MetroPlus' preliminary results using last year's rates are 63.52 points. # of Measures Under 50th Percentile # of Measures Between 50th and 74th Percentile # of Measures Between 75th and 89th Percentile # of Measures Meeting or Exceeding 90th Percentile 5 6 5 10 The five (5) QARR measures in which MetroPlus were under the 50th percentile are: antidepressant medication- acute phase; diabetes BP 140/90; seven day follow -up after a mental health hospitalization; follow -up care for children prescribed ADHD medication- initiation phase; and spirometry testing for COPD. MetroPlus will be in receipt of their scores for the QARR portion of the incentive in the fall of 2012. Based on the Consumer's Guide to Medicaid Managed Care in NYC, MetroPlus has been rated #1 Medicaid Managed Care health plan in NYC for six out of the last seven years. Based on indicators chosen by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) and published in the Consumer's Guide to Medicaid Managed Care in New York City. The 2011 guide, based in part on quality ratings submitted by the health plans and a NYSDOH member satisfaction survey, shows MetroPlus with an 82% percent overall rating, ranking it first among New York City's eleven Medicaid Managed Care plans. The ratings are based on measures including plans' preventive and well-care for adults and children, quality of care provided to members with illnesses and patient satisfaction with access and service. For the first time ever, in 2011 MetroPlus was ranked #1 in New York State and New York City. Dr. Saperstein moved on to the discussion of clinical risk groups (CRGs) which is a risk based methodology in which a plan obtains money based on how sick its members are. NYS uses 3M's clinical risk groups (CRG) software to determine the disease classification of Medicaid and FHP plan members and uses those scores to risk adjust health plan premiums. CRGs are assigned using one in- patient claim or at least two outpatient visits per calendar year, otherwise the member is considered healthy - significant co- morbidities and severity greatly influence CRG assignment and lack of complete coding affects the member's CRG score. MetroPlus Network Relations and Quality Management Departments share facility -based information throughout the year with HHC senior leadership and Managed Care, as well as community providers, on: members who have not had a PCP visit (non- users); and members who have not had appropriate tests/follow -up (QARR measures). MetroPlus works with HHC and other providers to get members into care, improving their medical outcomes; and MetroPlus encourages providers to appropriately code all encounters; this has a significant effect on the rates they receive. The ultimate goal is that if a patient has secondary diagnoses and you are thinking about them during the actual care, they should be coded appropriately. 2010 CRG scores will be used for NYS FY 2012-2013 risk adjusted premium rates. MetroPlus' FHP index score declined 0.1% from '09-10 and the Medicaid index score was unchanged. Utilization Management Initiatives (2011 key achievements) to promote appropriate utilization of MetroPlus' risk arrangement with HHC include: Chest Pain Focused Review - 2011 net denial rate was 30% with a $1,064,250 savings; physical occupational/speech therapy review - 2011 net denial rate of 27% with a $562,664 savings; and DRG validation - pre-payment savings of $8.4 million with a post -xv payment of $2.8 million total claims recovery. Medicare SNP model of care implementation received maximum three (3) year approval on Model of Care with a score of 88.75%. Medicare SNP structure and process measures scored 100% in 2011. In 2011, 36% of denials were appealed. Excluding lack of clinical denials, 63% of MetroPlus denials were upheld. The 2012 Case Management key initiatives are: 1) reduction of readmissions - outreac h to all Medicaid members within 48 hours of a hospital admission; and 20 enhanced facility relationships - each HHC facility has a dedicated MetroPlus case manager for assistance with care coordination. MetroPlus processed approximately 4.7 million claims in 2011. Overall, the average non- Medicare claims processing time from receipt to payment for January through December 2011 was 8.4 days. The Claims Department processed to finalization 99.2% of these receipts within the 30- day timeframe and 99.5% within the 45 day timeframe as set out under the State Insurance Department Prompt Pay Law. Dr. Saperstein highlighted the numerous audits that MetroPlus has undergone as follows: 1) Article 44 Regulatory Audit - no findings; SDOH required simplification of language used in denial letters; 2) Child Health Plus Audit - successfully completed on the first round; 3) Medicare SNP Model of Care Implementation - CMS Special Needs Plan application: 88% score in 2011; MetroPlus now has a 3- year exemption to the annual submission requirement, and NCQA Structure and Process Measures: 100% score in last audit - 2011; and 4) Finance Audits: successfully completed 2011 Certified Financial Statements, 2008 Medicare Financial Audit and 2011 Medicare B id Audit - no audit found any material weakness; incorporating suggestions from Bid Audit to enhance future bid submissions. The Network Relations Department was formed in 2005 to improve and expand the level of communication between MetroPlus and it s participating facilities, members and providers. Network Relations Managers meet regularly with top level administrators at network facilities and Community Providers to discuss quality indicators, CRGs and member/patient satisfaction. Provider Services Representatives work with Participating Providers to ensure that they provide the highest level of care to our members: 2,141 encounters in first quarter of 2012. Customer Services Representatives are located at HHC facilities and handle member complaints and inquiries: 37,966 inquiries in first quarter of 2012.Care Coordinators conduct member outreach, education and case management: 3,479 outreaches in first quarter of 2012. The Network Relations Department continues to increase alignment between HHC and MetroPl us by coordinating meetings with Senior Executive leadership to discuss each facility's key performance. MetroPlus' customer services' call center operates six days a week (Monday - Saturday), 12 hours a day (8 AM - 8 PM). Over the past 12 months (June 2011 - May 2012), the Call Center received a total of 975,635 calls. Customer Services Representatives are thoroughly trained to handle calls from members and providers for all lines of business. Call types range from basic plan eligibility, benefit/services, assisting with appointments/referrals, address/demographic changes, selection of PCP, assistance with the homeless population, arranging transportation, provider/claims inquiries, DME and Pharmacy issues, complaint investigations and Utilization Management calls which include referrals to case management, authorization, and Managed Long Term Care. Customer Services Representatives (CSR) speak approximately 15 languages. In addition to handling inbound calls, each CSR is assigned to a project team that is responsible for conducting outbound calls to members. These outbound calls cover three different areas: 1) new member orientations; 2) completion of health risk assessment forms (HRA) for submission to case management team; and 3) member notifications including PCP relocations, PCP terminations, and auto- assignments. Information is key to MetroPlus' current and future success. MetroPlus' IT infrastructure has grown proportionally with Plan growth. Eighty percent (80%) of applications systems are in regular use, run on over 135 servers, 25% of MetroPlus servers are physical and 75% are virtual, 20 servers are dedicated to support telephone applications, and MetroPlus is moving to 100% virtual servers. Server configuration is duplicated and running at MetroPlus' BRP site, SunGard\u00ae, for critical systems. Original contract with DST Health Solutions - PowerStepp System was entered into in 2000. The contract was renewed in 2007 which ends in 2015. A negotiated acquisition process was underway in 2011, and it was decided that MetroPlus did not have the necessary resources or infrastructure to proceed with replacing the current core system. MetroPlus will evaluate their core system again in 2012, beginning with a phase one system review. Major benefits that are delegated to third parties include dental services to HealthPlex and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) to CVS/Caremark. On an annual basis, MetroPlus conducts an operational audit of these vendors to assess operational performance as well as compliance with State and CMS regulations. In 2011, MetroPlus conducted these audits via desk review; in 2012, the audits will perform onsite operational audits. The performance reports and any other issues identified with a vendor are reported on a quarterly basis to the MetroPlus Quality Assurance Committee. MetroPlus has fully transitioned to a new Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM), CVS Caremark, selected through the RFP process. Eff ective October 1, 2011, MetroPlus, in conjunction with CVS Caremark, took over responsibility for managing pharmacy benefits to an additional xvi 388,000 Medicaid and Family Health Plus members (~$400M annually), which were managed by Fee for Service Medicaid. MetroPlus' Child Health Plus, Medicare Advantage and MetroPlus Gold members were also transitioned to CVS Caremark on January 1, 2012. The MetroPlus team has worked very closely with CVS Caremark to ensure a smooth transition and implementation for all of MetroPlu s members and providers. Effective August 1, 2011, personal care services (PCS) will be carved into the MetroPlus benefit package to provide services essential to the maintenance of the member's health and safety in the home, and for assistance with personal hygiene, dressing, feeding, nutritional and environmental support functions. MetroPlus is providing personal care services to approximately 1,210 members. This provision required MMC/FHP plans to contract with a Certified Home Health Agency (CHHA) to conduct assessments and a network of personal care agencies. HHC and NYCHSRO provide nursing assessments. Statewide, there are approximately 12,000 restricted recipients and seventy -five percent (75%) reside in NYC. Mandatory enrollment into managed care began July 2011. MetroPlus is managing restrictions for 1,025 restricted recipients. MetroPlus has maintained current restrictions as set by the SDOH and continually assesses members to determine if the restriction should remain in place. Mandatory enrollment began in New York City in July 2012 for persons 21 and older in need of 120 days or more of service into a Managed Long Term Care (MLTC) or other \"coordinated care\" model. Certain exclusions/exemptions apply (e.g. hospice, Native Americans) and assessments are required every six months. Enrollees will be given 30 days to select an MLTC plan. After 30 days, enrollees will be auto- assigned to a partial cap MLTC plan and it is unclear if the State will auto- assign members to plans with a newly awarded license. MetroPlus has submitted an application to become a MLTC and expects to be awarded a license after a July 2012 readi ness review. The challenges that MetroPlus faces are: 1) Dental carve- in affects approximately 350,000 members - change from FFS to HealthPlex; 2) Health care reform - NYS Exchange must ensure MetroPlus' ability to participate; 3) Medicare membership grow th - 11,000 members by June 30, 2013; 4) Multiple CMS audits; 5) MLTC implementation; 6) Behavioral health integration; and 7) ACO implementation wi th HHC. In summary, MetroPlus has many growth opportunities and challenges and they look forward to working with HHC and sharing their progress. Strategic Planning Committee - July 10, 2012 As reported by Josephine Bolus, RN Senior Vice President Remarks Ms. Brown greeted and informed the Committee that her remarks would include brief updates on federal, state and city issues and the corporation's Breakthrough work. FEDERAL UPDATE Ms. Brown reported that, on June 26, 2012, the Senate had passed bipartisan legislation that would extend the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) authority for five more years to assess user fees on prescription drugs and medical devices. The House passed the bill by a voice vote during the week of June 17th. The President is expected to sign this bill. Ms. Brown informed the Committee that, most importantly for HHC, the legislation included provisions to mitigate prescription drug shortages. The bill would require drug manufacturers to provide the FDA early notification of discontinuations or other situations that could lead to potential shortages; additionally, it would also allow the FDA to expedite approval of manufacturing changes that would help prevent and mitigate shortages. Ms. Brown reported that the bill also included improved public recordkeeping of a drug shortage list and required that the FDA issue updated guidance on repackaging, which would modify current practices to allow hospital systems to share drug shortages among their facilities. Ms. Brown noted that this is an important issue f or HHC. Ms. Brown added that the pharmaceutical industry supported the legislation which included accelerated approval provisions and a provision to extend market exclusivity on some new antibiotics for an additional five years. She added that the reorganization of the Act was an important bipartisan milestone for this Congress. xvii World Trade Center Health Program Update Ms. Brown provided the Committee with an update on HHC's World Trade Center (WTC) Health Center program. She reported that H HC had successfully renewed its contract with the federal government for its Clinical Center of Excellence (CCE) for WTC survivors for nearly $3.5 million; and for its associated Data Center for $1.25 million. The renewed contract period will be for the period starting July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013. Ms. Brown explained that, having signed these contracts was the first step toward negotiating an increase in the contract amounts. Ms. Brown reported that HHC's WTC Health Program had been awarded an additional $187,000 by the federal government to fund HHC's annual WTC Health Center program subway campaign. She explained that this year's campaign will be primarily focused on Staten Island. Additionally, the campaign will entail new bus shelter ads in targeted neighborhoods throughout Staten Island and the remaining four boroughs to reach the Chinese, Spanish and Polish communities. She added that, this was a particular focus bec ause NIOSH's published data had documented that 91 percent of new enrollees for HHC's WTC Health Center program (i.e., not incumbent patients) were primarily English speakers, which caused some concern for HHC. This campaign will be launched for a period of one month, which will begin on September 1, 2012. STATE UPDATE Ms. Brown reported that the New York State Legislature had adjourned on June 21, 2012. HHC and its advocacy partners were successful in advocating against several bills that would have had a significant financial impact on HHC. Such legislation included two safe patient handling bills, which would have required health care facilities, nursing homes and hospitals to pass specific staffing and equipment requirements. Ms. Brown noted that this legislation was driven by nurses' concern about lifting and moving patients . She explained that the second bill would have imposed stringent, inflexible nurse to patient staffing ratios and recording requirements on HHC. Specifically, it would have required HHC to hire 4,100 new nurses in order to comply with that proposed legislation at a cost of more than $400 million. Ms. Brown reported that a medical malpractice bill was also rolled back, which would have increased HHC's malpractice costs by an estimated five percent. That bill also had a requirement that a defendant could decide prior to trial how their liability would be determined if a codefendant settled the case. Ms. Brown explained that a provision of that same bill, which reversed a 2007 Arons Decision, would prohibit defendants from privately interviewing later -treating providers to determine extent of a plaintiff's injuries. Ms. Brown noted that there were other key legislative items that were of importance to HHC that were not addressed in this legislative session. Of these items, a priority concern for HHC is the indigent care methodology that is utilized by the state to allocate charity care funding to hospitals. It is expected that this item will be addressed in the next session. CITY UPDATE Ms. Brown reported that on June 25, 2012, the City Council passed the fiscal year 2013 Budget. She explained that the City Council had restored more than $14.5 million in expense funding and appropriated $21 million in capital funding to HHC. On the Expense s ide, the City Council provided: $6 million - HHC's Unrestricted City Subsidy $5 million - Child Health Clinics $2 million - Expanded HIV Testing $1.46 million - Developmental Evaluation Clinics $50,000 - Substance Abuse training funds Ms. Brown highlighted some key HHC projects that received Capital funding from the City Council. The City Council allocated: $7 million in FY 13 and FY 14 for construction of a comprehensive diagnostic and treatment center (D&TC) at 155 Vanderbilt Avenue on Staten Island $2.5 million for Metropolitan to renovate their Cancer Center and to purchase a new Ultrasound System $2.25 million for Coney Island Hospital to purchase new cardiac monitors for the ED, new pneumatic tubes for the ED as well as a new Communication System $2.06 million for Kings County to purchase a new MRI Ms. Brown stated that every Borough Delegation provided some significant level of funding for capital equipment and/or capital projects for HHC's hospitals. She stated that HHC is very appreciative of the City Council, the Borough Delegations and the Council Speaker's leadership and for their commitment to HHC. xviii HHC Initiative Update Breakthrough Ms. Brown provided the Committee with an update on the corporation's Breakthrough efforts on behalf of her colleague, Joanna Omi, Senior Vice President, Organizational Effectiveness and Innovation. Ms. Brown reported that, as of the end of June, there had been more than 1,000 Rapid Improvement Events (RIEs). This work generated more than $225 million in new revenues and cost savings, with more than that 12,750 employees having now participated in some form of Breakthrough activity. In addition, a total of 5,700 staff has participated in the centralized training program to learn skills including event facilitation, problem solving and process control board development. Ms. Brown reported that Jacobi Medical Center had initiated a model value stream in Perioperative Services. This model value stream will build on the Breakthrough improvements that are already in place in Perioperative Services and will take those improvements to the level of improvement hyper -drive. As Jacobi experiments with improving their staffing models and in- depth value stream mapping it digs deeply to understand the root cause of problems. Ms. Brown noted that the enhanced improvements gained would be transferred to other HHC facilities. Ms. Brown informed the Committee that in May, the first of a new, multilevel Breakthrough manager training program, designed to ensure the maximization of RIE outputs and to prepare managers to sustain the outcomes of those events, was piloted. Additionally, the corporation has expanded its use of Hoshin Kanri, a Lean management tool that will help HHC to achieve greater alignment and focus toward key strategic goals. Ms. Andrea Cohen, who represented Deputy Mayor Linda Gibbs in a voting capacity, asked how many employees have been involved in some form of Breakthrough activity. Ms. Brown responded that 12,750 staff members have participated in some form of breakthrough activity; and another 5,720 HHC staff members have partic ipated in training. Mr. Rosen, Committee Member, asked if the 5,700 total staff members who had participated in training was also part of the 12,000 staff who had participated in Breakthrough. Ms. Brown responded affirmatively. She explained that staff members who had been engaged in Breakthrough activities had also received some form of training as well. Information Item : The Health Care Case: Outcome and Potential Impacts Dominic Perella, Associate, Hogan Lovells Legal Practice, Washington, DC Ms. Brown introduced Mr. Dominic Perella, an associate with Hogan Lovells legal practice located in Washington D.C. She infor med the Committee that Mr. Perella would be walking the Committee through the most recent Supreme Court decision on the Health Care Affordable Care Act or the Health Care Reform Law and would engage the Committee in a conversation about the implications of that decision. Ms. Brown summarized Mr. Perella's background as the following: Dominic Perella concentrates his practice on appellate and Supreme Court litigation. Mr. Perella has argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the D.C. Court of Appeals, and has briefed numerous cases before the Supreme Court and the majority of the federal circuits. He was named, and one of his arguments mentioned, in the National Law Journal's 2011 Appellate Hot List. Mr. Perella's appellate practice has covered constitutional questions, insurance law, environmental regulation, Medicare regulation, and white -collar criminal appeals, among other areas. He also has developed a focus on communications law, and in that capacity has litigated matters on behalf of cable industry clients and participated in rulemakings before the Federal Communications Commission. Mr. Perella began his presentation by stating that the Supreme Court Decision concerning the Affordable Care Act (ACA), announced on June 28, 2012, was momentous in a lot of ways. At first glance, it appeared that the Supreme Court upheld the ACA across the board, but that was not the case. He explained that there were serious ramifications for Medicaid coming out of this decision, and would discuss the implications for the Medicaid program going forward. As background, Mr. Perella informed the Committee that he had drafted, on behalf of the American Hospital Association and the other major hospital associations, the Association's briefs in the Supreme Court. He explained that this work began in 2010, when the first lawsuit suit was filed in Florida, which was elevated to the Supreme Court. The lawsuits covered issues including the ACA's individual mandate, Medicaid, severability etc. A lot of those issues are now off the table after the Supreme Court's decision. xix Mr. Perella reported that the driving force behind the ACA was the uninsurance crisis. There are fifty million uninsured individuals, at last count, in this country. This figure is more than five times the population of New York City. He explained that the goal of the ACA is to expand health insurance coverage to 30 million Americans. Coverage would be expanded in two big ways - through an individual mandate and the expansion of Medicaid to new groups, including individuals up to 133 percent of the poverty level. Mr. Perella stated that the Supreme Court's decision was a surprise to all of the prognosticators including him. It was expe cted that Supreme Court Justice Kennedy would have had the swing vote. It was also widely expected that the original mandate would rise and fall on the Congress' laws. Mr. Perella informed the Committee that Chief Justice Roberts had issued an opinion which upheld the individual mandate and the rest of the law based on Congress' tax power. Mr. Perella commented that it has been widely reported in the media that the Chief Justice Roberts had actually flipped. He originally voted with the other four conservatives to strike down the law. When he began drafting the majority opinion and some point down the line, Chief Justice Roberts changed his mind and decided to uphold the law and joined the Court's four democratic appointees. Mr. Perella explained that the main argument that was made by challengers of the ACA was that the Commerce Clause only authorized Congress to regulate commerce. In the case of the ACA, Congress would not be doing that but would be creating commerce. This would force individuals who were not in the market into the market. Congress had never done so before and should not do that. Mr. Perella stated that there were a number of responses to that argument that had been articulated by the government and by hospital associations in briefs. He stated that an obvious response was what Congress was doing with the ACA was not regulating an activity or regulating something that wasn't commerce. It was regulating the massive interstate commercial problem. That is, the disloc ations caused by the uninsurance crisis. Specifically, the monies that were being forced - that individuals with insurance, insurance companies and providers are being forced to pay to cover those who are not insured. All of that crossed state lines. Mr. Perella stated that a number of well-respected co nservative judges accepted that argument including Lloyd Sullivan of the 18th Circuit, Jeff Sutherland of the Sixth Circuit and Richard Bosner of the Seventh Circuit. Notwithstanding, five Justices accepted the challenger's argument. They said that Congress could not enact the individual mandate as a Congress power. Mr. Perella noted that Chief Justice Roberts ruled for himsel f only in that regard. The same opinion was voiced by the four dissenting conservatives. This resulted in five votes on the Suprem e Court for the proposition that mandates were not permissible under the Commerce Clause. Mr. Perella read Justice Roberts' key quote which states, \"The individual mandate does not regulate existing commercial activ ity. It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product.\" Mr. Perella explained that Roberts' key concern as he voiced throughout the entire proceedings in this case was \"...construing the commerce clause to permit Congress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority.\" Justice Roberts stated that, if Congress could enforce a mandate on Americans in this context, why not with broccoli? Why not with cars? Mr. Perella informed the Committee that, the first part of the decision concerning the Commerce Clause, which claimed that the individual mandate was not a good law under the commerce law powers, led Fox, CNN and other media organizations to place banners on thei r pages stating that the decision to mandate had been struck down. Apparently, President Obama believed that for several minutes because he was watching those stations. That turned out to be wrong but it was quickly corrected. Mr. Perella stated that the Justice Roberts joined by the four Democratic appointees, accepted the federal government's alternative argument, which was that the mandate is permissible under Congress' tax power. He explained that Justice Roberts said, \"...Courts are required to give Congress the benefit of the doubt. If we can read a statute to be constitutional we have to do so. This statute looks a lot like a tax, it functions like a tax, and it is enforced by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We are therefore restrained to read it as a tax in order to save it from invalidation. The government asks us to interpret the mandate as imposing a tax; it would otherwise violate the Constitution. Granting the Act the full measure of deference owed to federal statutes, it can be so read. Therefore, the mandate survives.\" Mr. Perella stated that, because the mandate survived, the rest of the law including some sections with Medicaid also survived. Once the mandate was upheld, the question of severability disappeared. Mr. Perella noted that Democratic appointees were unhappy with Justice Roberts' discussion concerning the Commerce Clause. Mr. Perella explained that Justice Roberts prepared a 20-page discussion of the commerce law to lay down a marker for Congress that mandates would not be permissible going forward. Justice Kagan wrote that Roberts should not have reached the commerce law at all, given the tax analysis. Mr. Perella added that, if another Justice had flipped the whole argument would have been struck down. They had five votes to strike down the mandate. Justice Kennedy seemed to be on board for striking everything else. So Roberts' decision to rest on the tax power, in fact, caused the entire argument to stand instead of fall. Mr. Perella explained that the Medicaid argument was really about an obscure concept in constitutional law called the coercion doctrine. The way the doctrine works is that Congress can offer states money, say $100 million for road construction if you pass such and such a law. The classic example is you can you have this road construction money if you make your drinking age 21 and if you don't you can't. xx But Congress cannot directly demand states to enact legislation to set the drinking age. So Congress couldn't command that states set the drinking age of 21. It has to be theoretically voluntary. He continued to explain that the Supreme Court had suggested is past cases, but never actually held that if the states ever had no choice about whether to accept funds, if the offer for some reason amounted to coercion, that would be the equivalent of a demand and it would violate the Tenth Amendment. Mr. Perella added that, this was the first case after more than 200 years in which the Supreme Court had ever found unlawful coercion to exist. It w as not a five to four vote on this issue; the vote was seven to two. Justices Kagan and Breyer joined with the conservatives in finding that, in this circumstance, the Medicaid condition, which was basically this, Congress said, states expand your Medic aid program as set forth in the ACA or else we will strip from you not just the money that we would have given you for the ACA but all Medicaid funds. The deciding justices said that is coercion. Roberts said \"In this case, the financial inducement Congress has chosen is much more than relatively mild encouragement -- it is a gun to the head. A state that opts out of the ACA's expansion in health care coverage stands to lose not merely a relatively small percentage of its existing Medicaid funding, but all of it.\" As such, the seven to two vote is historic. Mr. Perella stated that, there was a different majority for that remedy. Roberts and the four Democratic appointees decided that the Medicaid provision didn't have to be struck down to fix the problem. Instead, the Medicaid expansion had to be optional. That is, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could not threaten to hold all t aid from the states that refused to expand their Medicaid offers. Mr. Perella emphasized that the bottom line is that the ACA is upheld with some limits on Medicaid. All programs other than Medicaid remain in place and unchanged. States will push ahead with implementation. Agencies will push ahead with rulemakings. The big exception is the Medicaid issue. The first decision appears to mean that states are free to entirely decline to expand the Medicaid programs along the lines ACA suggest s. One question of course is which states would do so. The states with conservative governors, like Texas and Florida have threaten ed not to expand their Medicaid programs. Whether they will go through with it is another question. The second big question is what could the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) do about that? The Supreme Court m akes clear that CMS could not threaten all previous funding. However, it does not make clear whether CMS could withhold other ACA funding or other ACA benefits from states that refuse to expand Medicaid. Notwithstanding, CMS could make a good faith argument that that is permissible under the Roberts ruling. Mr. Perella stated that the third question is whether states can partially expand their Medicaid programs. Some states may want to expand Medicaid to a certain population but not another, which they may have to negotiate with CMS. Concerning Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) funding, Mr. Perella stated that DSH hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income individuals have received extra funds for years under Medicaid. The ACA sets annual dramatic cuts in the DSH funding. The idea was, because Medicaid would be expanded, because of the individual mandate, far more people would have insurance coverage. So the funds that were being given to hospitals for uncompensated care would be reduced. Mr. Perella described the way that DSH cuts would work under the ACA. He added that there will be a set annual amount of cuts. The DSH cut for the first year will be $500 million. CMS is instructed to divide those cuts up among the states. One strategy is to give the least amount of DSH funds to the states with the lowest percentage of uninsured individuals. Mr. Perella described a scenario where a number of states that choose not to expand Medicaid could end up with higher percentages of uninsured individuals. Those stat es w ould actually get more DSH funds. States that went ahead and expanded Medicaid would get less DSH funds. Mr. Perella informed the Committee that, one of the questions he had been asked to address was whether that would be the necessary outcome. His respons e for states that are most likely going to expand Medicaid is that it is not necessarily so. The statute provides two methods for the Secretary to administer this provision. One way is to give these funds to states with the lowest percentage of uninsured individuals. The second way is for CMS to give the least funds to states that do not target hospitals with high volume Medicaid patients and hospitals that have high levels of uncompensated care. He explained that the Secretary can set up the division of the DSH cuts by giving the least DSH funds to states that are doing the worst job of sending the DSH funds to the right places, which would be those hospitals that are helping with the highest percentage of poor people. Mr. Perella stated that the Secretary appears to have complete discretion to choose. xxi SUBSIDIARY BOARD REPORT MetroPlus Health Plan, Inc. - July 10, 2012 As reported by Mr. Bernard Rosen Chairperson's Remarks Chair Rosen welcomed everyone to the MetroPlus Board of Directors meeting of July 10, 2012. Mr. Rosen advised the Board that Dr. Saperstein would present the Executive Director's report and Dr. Dunn would report on Medical Management issues. Mr. Rosen stated that there would be two resolutions presented. The first was to increase the spending authority for the Plan's contract with Buck Consultants and the second resolution was to authorize a contract with McMurry, Inc. to provide member newsletters. Execu tive Director's Report Dr. Saperstein reported that total plan enrollment as of June 18 th, 2012 was 433,872. Breakdown of plan enrollment by line of business is as follows: Medicaid 365,987 Child Health Plus 16,349 Family Health Plus 36,802 MetroPlus Gold 3,123 Partnership in (HIV/SNP) 5,803 Medicare 5,808 Dr. Saperstein stated that MetroPlus enrollment has increased since his last report to the Board. The Plan has experienced an increase of 5,023 members, with the greatest increase reflected in the Medicaid line of business. Mr. Still asked if the Plan was on target for its annual membership goal and Dr. Saperstein stated that the Plan has exceeded its goal. Attached to Dr. Saperstein's report was a graph showing net transfers for the month of May 2012 for Medicaid and Family Health Plus (FHP). Dr. Sapers tein stated that this is updated data that shows the same downward trend to the same health plan. Dr. Saperstein stated that he wants to make sure that the Board realizes these are members leaving MetroPlus to go to the other health plan and after a couple of studies it has been discovered that 80 percent of these individuals are leaving HHC when they go to the other health plan. There was a brief discussion regarding the Affordable Care Act and how it will affect the Plan and HHC. The New York State Department of Health (SDOH) released utilization data for the Managed Care Pharmacy Carve- In that became effective on October 1 st, 2011. The data, a comparison of the three months before the carve- in and the most current three months post implementation, reveal that statewide, utilization is up and costs are down. MetroPlus' cost in the three months prior to the implementation was $76.80 per member per month (PMPM). MetroPlus' costs for the first three months of 2012 were $59.75 PMPM. Due to these declines in cost, seen also by other plans, the state's actuary, Mercer, has recommended significant decreases to the Pharmacy capitation. Ms. Weinberg asked if the $59.75 was and average and Dr. Saperstein replied that it is the MetroPlus average rate for a 3 month period of time. SDOH has provided a draft of the Phase 1 pharmacy rate change analysis. The total rate change for Medicaid in New York City w as - 7.1%. The total rate change for FHP in NYC was -11.5%. The release of this data solidifies the Plan's initial analysis which found that MetroPlus would receive approximately 3 million dollars less in pharmacy revenue per month, retroactive to April 1 st, 2012. The Plan's trade organizations are pushing back on these rate decreases because Mercer is basing the reduction on only three months worth of data. The request is to wait until there is more complete and accurate data and then to retroactively adjust the rate. Dr. Saperstein reported that the 2013 Medicare Bids were successfully submitted to CMS. Cost savings allowed MetroPlus to add benefits in its Medicare Advantage (Dual), Select (Dual) and Platinum (Straight Medicare) lines of business. The Plan was able to reduce co-payments and deductibles and include some value added benefits such as an over -the-counter non- prescription benefit catalog and a gym membership at NYC Parks & Recreation sites. As Dr. Saperstein reported in May, MetroPlus did face challenges in its ability to offer additional services in its Medicare HIV/PIC Special Needs Plan. Unfortunately, MetroPlus' historical utilization especially in pharmaceuticals was very high in its Medicare HIV/PIC Special Needs Plan (SNP). In addition, CMS reduced the risk intensity of HIV members by 15% and the Plan's rates were dramatically reduced. Changes to the HIV SNP product were made to account for this reduction and include an increase in co- payments and reduction in some xxii benefits. These changes affect the 300 members in MetroPlus' HIV/PIC SNP and may make this product more difficult to market and add member ship in 2013. As Dr. Saperstein reported earlier this year, as of July 2nd, 2012, all Medicaid managed care plans will be required to cover dental services for their enrollees. The MetroPlus dental implementation is going well. The Plan has contracted with Healthplex to administer dental benefits for all its MetroPlus Medicaid and Medicaid SNP members. Also as of July 2 nd, 2012, MetroPlus Family Health Plus, Child Health Plus, and Medicare Advantage members will have management of their dental benefits transition from DentaQuest to Healthplex. Also part of Dr. Saperstein's report earlier this year, mandatory enrollment for Managed Long Term Care (MLTC) was scheduled to begin on July 1, 2012. MetroPlus' application was completed and submitted in May. Dr. Saperstein was happy to report that MetroPlus is scheduled for a full day Department of Health onsite readiness review on July 10 th, 2012. The Plan anticipates that after the readiness review is completed, it will be granted a license and can begin to manage this new population. In mid -June, SDOH sent Medicaid MLTC plans premium rates effective April 1, 2012. The rates reflect a net reduction of 1.1% to plan premiums from 2011- 2012 rates. In addition to continued Medicaid Redesign Team rate reductions, the administrative cap amount was reduced by 7%. SDOH is also working on July 1 rates to coincide with the mandatory enrollment for MLTC. However, the Long Term Home Health Care Program (LTHHCP), also known as the Lombardi program, will still be accepting new admissions until September 1. Maximus will be the MLTC enrollment broker only for those individuals that receive a mandatory enrollment notice. Voluntary enrollments will still occur through the plan, as they do now. Mandatory assignments will only be made to partial capitation MLTC plans, not to PACE or MA P. MetroPlus is still waiting for a decision from SDOH if it will receive auto -assignments or if there will be a moratorium for some period of time until the Plan has demonstrated experience. Dr. Saperstein stated that MetroPlus is also in the process of meeting all network and facility leadership in regards to its strategic initiatives to grow the Medicare product. The Plan has had productive meetings with the Generations Plus Network, the South Manhattan Health Network and all of HHC managed care coordinators at their monthly meeting in June. Analysis of data provided by HHC shows that there is a pool of 22,000 fee- for-service dual eligible patients currently seeking care at the HHC facilities. MetroPlus has committed to working with HHC towards building the internal processes and systems needed to facilitate potential enrollment of these dual eligible patients that can aid in the expected expansion of MetroPlus' Medicare membership. Medical Director's Report Attached to Dr. Dunn's report was the most recent copies of the MetroPlus Gold Health News, Medicare Well Being- The Path to Good Health and Medicaid Health Letter. The MetroPlus Gold Health News articles focus on six foods that help fight cancer; being socially active can keep you healthy; protecting joints from aches and pains; staying informed can keep you healthy; and how MetroPlus' care management programs can help you successfully manage your health. The current issue of the Medicaid Health Letter focuses on ways to reduce the adverse health effects of pollen and dust; the importance of getting all children ages 1 and 2 tested for lead poisoning; and an update on health benefits and coverage. Medicare Well Being- The Path to Good Health and Medicaid Health Letter stress the importance of getting all your questions answered by your doctor; the availability of Medicare Case Managers to help members manage their health so they can live a healthier and better life; and five ways to fight allergies. Dr. Dunn reported that the Quality Management (QM) Department completed several mailing since the last Board of Directors Meeting as a part of its ongoing educational campaign to members and providers. All MetroPlus members over the age of 65 were sent a flyer explaining the importance of having an Advance Directive. At the end of the flyer, members were encouraged to have a discussi on with their doctor about an Advance Directive, as well as identified a Health Care Agent. Members were asked to send copies of the form to MetroPlus QM Department as well to their doctor. Flyers were mailed to 5,580 members. All MetroPlus providers were sent an updated QARR Poster highlighting the key quality measures and appropriate interventions. The posters have been proven to be a helpful reference tool for providers as they work towards improving HEDIS/QARR compliance. The poster is also on the MetroPlus website. Dr. Dunn stated that due to the Plan's low response on the Health Outcome Survey: Whether members self-reported that they received a pneumonia shot in the past 10 years, MetroPlus decided to send a mailing to all Medicare members over the age of 65 who hadn' t xxiii received a vaccination shot based on paid claims. The members were sent a letter explaining the signs and symptoms of pneumonia, and why it is important to get vaccinated. Dr. Dunn reported that, effective July 1st, MetroPlus Family Health Plus, Child Health Plus, and MetroPlus Medicare members transitioned from DentaQuest to Healthplex for their dental services. Also, as of July 1st MetroPlus will begin covering dental benefits for its Medicaid and Medicaid SNP members. These members w ere transitioned from fee for service Medicaid to Healthplex. Dr. Dunn stated that, effective October 1st, MetroPlus will be covering Orthodontic services through its Healthplex relationship. SDOH will be conducting secret shopper calls to ensure that members and providers are being provided accurate information. If a member calls inquiring on their dental benefits or is requesting to change their Dentist, they are instructed to contact Healthplex. Customer Services has received a total of 15,117 member calls related to dental services from May until the present. In addit ion, they have mailed 1,000 Dental Provider Directory to members requesting a directory. Dr. Dunn stated that the Plan has received numerous complaints from its providers that obtaining prior authorization for medi cations is very hard. MetroPlus worked with CVS Caremark to develop an electronic prior authorization where the provider from their desk can fill out the form and instantly get a decision. Dr. Dunn stated that the Plan will be doing a presentation to HHC Medical Directors in a few weeks to demonstrate this process. MetroPlus' provider network continues to grow, adding more primary care providers and specialists. Action Items : The first resolution was introduced by Mr. Dan Still, Chairman of the MetroPlus Finance Committee. Authorizing the Executive Director of MetroPlus Health Plan, Inc. (\"MetroPlus\" or the \"Plan\") to increase the spending authority for the contract with Buck Consultants, LLC, dated August 1, 2010, for the remainder of the contract, including two one- year options, with a term ending July 31, 2015, to an amount not to exceed $650,000 per year. Dr. Saperstein gave the Board a detailed overview of the need for the increase to the Buck contract. Dr. Saperstein stated that the Plan will require additional actuarial support due to unexpected audits and potential expansion. The resolution was passed unanimously by the MetroPlus Health Plan Board of Directors. The last resolution was also introduced by Mr. Still. Authorizing the Executive Director of MetroPlus Health Plan, Inc. (the \"Corporation\") to negotiate and execute a contract with McMurry, Inc. to provide member newsletter services for a term of three (3) years with two (2) options to renew, solely exercisable by MetroPlus, each for a one (1) year term for an amount not to exceed $500,000 per year. There was a brief discussion regarding price per issue and postage. Dr. Saperstein stated that these newsletters are sent out quarterly. It was stated that the new contract amount would not increase; it would remain the same as the last contract. * * * * * End of Reports* * * * * 1 ALAN D. AVILES HHC PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS JULY 26, 2012 SEA VIEW RECEIVES HIGH PRAISE IN JOINT COMMISSION SURVEY On July 12th, The Joint Commission completed its tr iennial accreditation survey of Sea View Hospital Rehabilitation Center and Home. The long term care su rveyor praised the processes in place, and was very complimentary of Sea View's leadership, as well as me dical, nursing and front line staff. The Leadership Interview Session, which was attended by HHC Board Me mber Dr. Vincent Calamia, included a discussion on the \"Stages of Maturity in Health Care Organizations' Path to High Reliability.\" The surveyor was particularly complimentary of two Sea View programs: the \"Stop and Watch\" program, which trains staff to identify and report changes in a resident's cond ition; and the Failure Modes Effects Analysis (FMEA) and action plan on reduction of urinary tract infections. The surveyor was impressed with organization's recognition by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for its stellar performance and #1 ranking on the Nursing Home Value-based Pu rchasing Demonstration Project on Avoidable Hospitalizations. The CMS ranking is based on staffi ng, quality measures, avoidable hospitalizations and multiple years of successful regulatory survey results. Congratulations to Senior Vice President Arthur Wagn er, Executive Director Angelo Mascia, Administrator Violet Huie, Medical Director Dr. Maria Pablo, Chief Nu rse Carole Morgan and the staff of Sea View for their outstanding survey performance. The conclusion of Sea View's survey completes The Joint Commission's 2012 multi-facility survey of HHC. In 2013, Elmhurst, Jacobi, Metropolitan, Gouverneur, an d Dr. Susan Smith McKinney are scheduled to be surveyed. PATIENT SAFETY FORUM ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN FACTORS A Patient Safety Forum entitled \"Advancing Patient Safety through the Understanding of Human Factors\" was held on at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Cent er on July 9th. It was attended by approximately 200 people from across HHC facilities. The keynote presentation was provided by Kerm Henriksen, Ph.D., Human Factors Advisor for Patient Safety, Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Sa fety at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). His presentation focused on how patien t and provider capabilities can affect the design of interactive healthcare systems to ensure safety , effectiveness, and ease of delivering care. The second speaker, Aileen Killen, RN, PhD, Director, Patient Safety Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, spoke on \"Human Factors in the Clinical Setting\". She shared her experiences when designing an Operating Room, looking at handoffs, and the value of clinical reminders. Her emphasis was to design work areas to fit the people an d not getting people to fit design. The final speaker was David L. Feldman, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice-President, Hospitals Insurance Company/FOJP, who presented \"Human Factors as a Risk Reduction Strategy: Creating a Culture of Safety in Peri-operative Services and Beyond.\" Th e focus of his presentation was on creating reliable 2 teams, by improving communication, mutual support/respect and leadership skills and encouraging implementation of a Just Culture to encourage open/honest reporting of errors. LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM LAUNCHES ITS FIRST SESSION On July 10th the first session of the corporate-wide Leadership Development program was held at Draper Hall with 121 middle managers and 32 senior staff, serv ing as coaches, in attend ance. The session was the first of five full day workshops to be conducted by the Advisory Board Company. The session focused on characteristics of different leadership styles, examin ed a case study of how change was led at Newton- Wellesley Hospital, and guided the participants throug h a self-assessment to deve lop a Personal Leadership Profile. Between workshops, coaches will work with each mana ger to refine their Leadership Profile, guided by scheduled calls with the Advisory Board instructor. In addition to the program workshops, participants, coaches and executive sponsors will receive access to the Harvard Manage Mentor+, an online resource with additional computer-based learning modules. The remaining workshops will focus on different aspect s of leadership including: instilling accountability; facilitating effective teamwork; critical thinking and problem solving; and impact through influence. The initial session was extremely well received. A second cohort of up to 125 participants is schedule d to begin a similar leadersh ip development program in Spring 2013. LINCOLN HOSPITAL RECEIVES QUEST FOR QUALITY AWARD AT JULY 19 LEADERSHIP SUMMIT OF AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center received the prestigious Quest for Quality award from the American Hospital Association (AHA) for its leadership and innovation in quality improvement and safety at the organization's annual AHA Health Forum Summit this month in San Francisco. Lincoln won the prize by demonstrating its commitment to providing patient-centered care focused on gro und-breaking methods that improve safety and quality. The awar d is presented annually to honor leadership and innovation based on the Institute of Medicine's (IOM's) si x quality aims -- safety, patient-centeredness, effectiveness, efficiency, timeliness and equity. Lincoln is one of four hospitals se lected this year from a nation-wide pool of hospitals competing for the prize. Dr. Melissa Schori, Lincoln's Ch ief Medical Officer, accept ed the finalist award. Lincoln is the second HHC hospital to receive this re cognition from the AHA. HHC's Queens Hospital Center was awarded the Quest for Quality Citation of Merit in 2010. HIV DIRECTOR AT HHC WINS TOP NATIONAL QUALITY AWARD FOR LEADERSHIP IN QUALITY Terry Hamilton, HHC's Director of HIV Services received the National Quality Cent er and Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau Awar d for Leadership in Quality. This national award recognizes work that Ms. Hamilton has done since 2005 as part of the HHC corporate-wide HIV Quality Improvement Learning Network. That work has also been critical in informin g the development of our enterprise Health Home care management program. Under her leadership, quality management has been a 3 primary concern in HIV services, and the quality of ca re has continued to improve measurably as a result. One example is the average retentio n rates, which have increased fr om 79% in 1999 to 91% in 2010. Terry Hamilton has a 22-year record as a leader in the development of quality improvement models of HIV care. During her te nure at HHC, she has spearh eaded several programs, in cluding the 2006 HIV Testing Expansion Initiative focused on making HIV testing part of routine care and decreasing the stigma associated with it. The program has had the three-fold goal of increasing the number of patients who know their HIV status, the proportion of patients who enter ca re early, and the proportion of patients retained in care. On World AIDS Day 2011, HHC was recognized by the Centers for Disease Control for testing more than 1 million patients. Ms. Hamilton has also led the four-year effort to develop HIV clinical documentation screens within the HHC electronic medical record, providing effective tools for easier monitoring and reporting. The National Quality Center, which works with agencies funded through the federal Ryan White CARE act, is the premiere quality improvement reso urce in HIV care. The organization strives to improve the quality of care by recognizing leadership in the development of state-of-the art HIV-related quality improvement services in HIV. I know the Board joins me in congratulating Terry Ha milton on this outstanding award and the additional prestige that it brings to HHC 's extraordinary HIV services. HHC HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD WITH MORE FARMERS MARKETS HHC welcomes back farmers markets at several public hospital campuses this summer, making healthy food available in communities where residents don't always have access to fresh fruits and vegetables at reasonable prices. Farmers markets are open now through November, with one market at Queens Hospital Center open year- round. Farmers markets are also hosted by Metropolitan , Jacobi, North Central Bronx, Lincoln, Coney Island and Elmhurst hospitals. HHC is part of a recently formed city-wide anti-obesi ty task force made up of 10 city agencies. The task force was established to develop strategies and initia tives to help New Yorkers stay healthy and fight the rising obesity epidemic. HHC has for several years had healthy eating and weight loss programs throughout its facilities to help New Yorkers of all ages boost their health an d physical fitness. The farmers markets are hosted in partnership with Harvest Home and Greenmarket. Shoppers can pay for their fresh fruits and leafy greens using EBT cards (food stamps), Health Bucks, Green Checks, Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) coupons and Women, Infants and Children (WIC) coupons. ELMHURST OPENS OBSERVATION UNIT TO IM PROVE EMERGENCY CARE, REDUCE INPATIENT ADMISSIONS This week Elmhurst Hospital opened a new chest pain unit. The 3,550 square foot unit has 13 beds and will be used to observe many of the ne arly 5,000 patients each year who co me to the emergency department at Elmhurst with chest pain. The new unit is a calm environment where patients can be safely observed for up to 23 hours and receive a complete battery of tests wi thin the ED. While in the unit, these patients will receive prompt evaluation and expedited care at the bedside. When appropriate, medical staff can release 4 patients or refer them for community-based services, if they do not need to be admitted. More observation time and more complete testing of pa tients before admission will assist in making accurate initial diagnoses and reduce preventable readmissions. The $1 million un it was financed by Council Member Daniel Dromm and the Queens delegation of the New York City Council. Elmhurst is opening the unit as part of a strategy to expand services and reduce wait times for patients who come to the hospital for emergency services. CARE PLAN MANAGEMENT SYST EM IMPLEMENTATION BEGINS This month, after the Board's a pproval at the May meeting, a co ntract between HHC and Microsoft Corporation was executed for the development and implementation of a Care Plan Management System. The contract includes software licenses, a patient health record and support and maintenance. The system will support care coordination services for HHC patien ts and ensure that HHC meets NYS Health Home certification requirements and Patient-Centered Medi cal Home (PCMH) standards for collaborative care planning. The system is a web-based, inter-operable to ol that aids both patients and their extended care teams in managing and coordinating the medical an d non-medical services and resources patients may require. The term of the contract with Microsoft is fo r five years, and is renewa ble for two additional one year terms. The software license is perpetual an d the annual maintenance and support agreements are auto-renewable. The total cost of the contract over the seven-year period is capped and will not exceed $16,100,000. The contract was successf ully developed with the collabo ration of the HHC offices of Information Technology, Ambulatory Care Transformation and Legal Affairs. HHC HOSPITALS APPLY FOR STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT HOSPITAL-MEDICAL HOME DEMONSTRATION PROJECT This month HHC submitted applications for the New York State Department of Heal th Hospital-Medical Home (H-MH) Demonstration Program on behalf of our 11 ho spitals. The H-MH Demonstration Program will make up to $250 million available over the next three years to NYS teaching hospitals to support transition of their outpatient training sites to Patient-Centered Medica l Homes (PCMHs). If successful, HHC is estimated to receive approximately $28 million of the $102 million to be disbursed in the first year of the demonstration, based on a formula derived from Medicaid volume and number of primary care residents receiving training at our facilities. Award notifications are expected someti me in August and successful applicants will then be required to submit a work-plan describing selected resi dent training continuity of care enhancements, care integration initiatives, and inpatient safety projec ts. Continued funding will be dependent upon meeting certain performance milestones, including achieving Leve l 2 or 3 NCQA PCMH re-certification by December 2013. HEALTH HOME SOFT LAUNCH IN BRONX AND BROOKLYN As announced last month, the Health Home \"soft launch\" was initiated this week in the boroughs of Brooklyn and The Bronx with activities for both patients and staff. Announcement letters describing the new program and its services and providing instructions on how indi viduals should proceed with enrollment were sent out to the initial cohort of 200 eligible patients. The toll-free \"Warm-Line\" wa s activated and is ready to provide information about the Health Home Program to callers. Also, a second phase of training focusing on outreach, patient enrollment and care coordination processes was conducted for approximately 20 staff members from Woodhull, Kings and Lincoln hospitals. Si x workers are ready to conduct outreach to the first group of patients eligible for enrollment. HHC TO ACHIEVE HIGH QUALITY, EXPANDED ACCESSIBLITY AND SAVINGS THROUGH CONTRACT WITH PROVIDER FOR DIALYSIS SERVICES 5 On your agenda today, for your review and approval, is a nine-year agreement with the Atlantic Dialysis Management Services (ADMS) for the provision of dialysis technical services to HHC patients in nine of our hospitals. You will also be considerin g a related real estate transaction for the licensing of space on five of our hospital campuses to be occupied and dedicated to the provision of dialysis services by ADMS. This contract has been structured to ensure that dialysis services continue to be convenient to our patients, meet high quality standards and help us achieve over $150 million in savings over nine years. Additionally, the contract will allow us to expand our capacity to provide these much-needed services by 35% over the next three years. All this will be achieved without any la yoff of employees currently involved in this service. As I have said in the past, HHC continues to stand behind its mission of ensuring access to all the uninsured, including undocumented immigrants, and our contract with the dialysis operator will reflect that. We have more than six years of experience with this dialysis op erator at Elmhurst Hospital and the quality of services has been excellent and no patient has ever been turned away. As the Board knows, HHC continues to struggle with a structural deficit of several hundred million dollars annually. It is very challenging to close that formidab le gap without compromising our mission or reducing our capacity to provide essential services. These agreem ents will contribute significantly to our gap-closing imperative while maintaining high quality dialysis care, and will actually increase access to these services. I urge the Board's support. NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR APPOINTED FO R KINGS COUNTY HOSPITAL CENTER After conducting an extensive search, we have appointed Ernest Baptiste as the Executive Director of Kings County Hospital Center, effective August 20th. Let me take this opportunity to thank Roslyn Weinstei n for her crucial leadership as the acting Executive Director of Kings County Ho spital since October 2011. Ki ngs County is one of our largest and most complex hospitals, with one of our busiest emergency departments. With Roslyn, we were fortunate to have a senior executive with extensive operational knowledge, financ ial acumen, a collaborative leadership style and a deep commitment to our mission. With her steady ha nd as interim Executive Director, Kings County was able to maintain its excellent standard of care and complete a very successful Joint Commission accreditation survey. I know that Roslyn will be equally indispensable in assisting with a smooth transition as Mr. Baptiste takes the rei ns as Executive Director. Ernest Baptiste brings with him more than twenty years of experience as a healthcare executive. Mr. Baptiste served during the last four years as the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of St. Francis Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware. He was also Chief Operating Officer of Duke University Medical Center in Durham North Carolina. Raised in Brooklyn, Mr. Baptiste also has significant local healthcare experience. He was a Vice President at St. Mary's Hospital in Brooklyn, served in various managerial roles at North General Hospital for over twelve years, and wo rked as a manager at Mount Sinai Hospital and Coney Island Hospital. I am confident that Mr. Baptiste's extensive hospital administrative experience, his deep understanding of New York City healthcare landscape, and his familiarit y and love of Brooklyn afford him a strong foundation for leadership at Kings County Hospital Center. I know you join me in welcoming him and offering him our full support. 6 ANNIVERSARY OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID ENACTMENT Next Monday, July 30th, marks the 47-year anniversar y of President Johnson's enactment of Medicare and Medicaid, health insurance programs created through the So cial Security Amendments of 1965. As you know, Medicare was created as a program to cover many healthcare costs for the elderly, a rapidly growing population with increasing healthcare needs and lim ited income. At the same time, Congress created the Medicaid program to provide coverage for other low- income people, including families with children, the blind and the disabled. Prior to the passage of this law, healthcare services for th e indigent were provided primarily through a patchwork of programs sponsore d by state and local gove rnments, charities, and community hospitals. The 1965 creation of Medicare and Medicaid followed many years of le gislative debate on the efficacy of a federal program to assist with coverage of healthcare costs. President Lyndon Johnson decided to sign the bill with former President Truman at the Truman Pr esidential Library in Independence, Missouri, in recognition of Truman's efforts 20 years earlier to establish a national health insurance program.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY EPIC SYSTEMS CORPORATION ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD The accompanying resolution requests approval to enter into a ten year contract with a n additional five year renewal option with Epic Systems Corporation to provide the Integrated Clinical Information System (ICIS) Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation for a total amount, inclusive of $22,971,500 for training and implementation , not to exceed $302,807,986. The existing E MR used a t HHC is a legacy system, which, over several years, continues to lose market share. T he product has had four changes in ownership (HDS, Medaphis, Per Se, Misys, and now QuadraMed). In 2006, HHC r eviewed the status of our current E MR in the marketplace. It found t here w as significant executive turn over inc luding at the CEO level, minimal new client sales during the previous two years, a relatively small budget for research and development, and that other products ha ve surpassed the incumbents' medical record functionalit y. The product (QCPR) and current vendor were determined to be unable to support HHC's future need for the next generation EMR. The Corporation has selected EPIC, a single enterprise- wide EMR to meet the needs of HHC's expansive size, improve patient c are, control costs, and overcome gaps in care transitions. In order to fully realize the benefits provided by the new ICIS system, HHC will undergo an intensive clinical standardization process which, together with the new technology, will position HHC fo r the challenges of an increasingly complex healthcare marketplace. HHC wishes to procure the EPIC solution to be able to increase patient safety through the use of efficien t and effective decision support. The EPIC system is scalable to the size and performance requirements of HHC and able to meet the unique requirements and workflows of facilities and programs throughout HHC. The EPIC System conforms to emerging and evolving HIT standards and utilize s modern technology to allow for interoperability wi th external systems, RHIO's and other providers. The EPIC EMR will be implemented at all eleven (11) HHC acute care hospitals, five (5) long term car e/long- term acute care hospital locations, six (6) diagnostic and treatment centers and over seventy (70 ) other commu nity based clinics. More than 8 ,000 physicians, 2,500 residents, 9,000 nurses, and many other clinical professionals will directly interact with the ICIS system on a daily basis and nearly all 39,000 of HHC's dedicated employees will be impacted by the new clinical system . The solution will be implemented within a scalable highly-available environment with full disaster recovery capabilities to minimize downtime. In 2008 HHC planned and initiated a Negotiated Acquisition for the new E MR. The following year, the Federal Government announced Meaningful Use incentive funding and HHC is currently attesting to meaningful use with an estimated $125,000,000 of incentive payments for the hospital program . These funds will be utilized to support the implementation costs for this software.

EEO Analysis: Approved as of 5/10/2012 Compliance with HHC's McBride Principles? X Yes No Vendex Clearance X Yes No Successful Responden t: EPIC SYSTEMS CORPORATION Contract Amount: $ 302,807,986 Contract Term: TEN YEARS WITH ONE 5 YEAR OPTION TO RENEW HHC 590B (R July 2011) 2 CONTRACT FACT SHEET( continued ) Background (include description and history of problem; previous attempts, if any, to solve it; and how this contract will solve it): HHC is dependent upon robust clin ical information systems to enable it to achieve and maintain excellence in patient care. The Current EMR vendor, QuadraMed is losing resources and market share. Several key programmers have left the organization and the software upgrades have been chall enging. HHC needed to perform 24 upgrades over 18 months, just to reach stage I of meaningful use. These upgrades consumed a tremendous amount of staff time and resulted in several significant periods when entire hospital networks were without the EMR. Our current experience with QuadraMed, as well as escalating costs to maintain eight different EMR systems are compelling reasons why HHC has pursued this Negotiated Acquisition. The healthcare marketplace is gearing up for Accountable Care. This transf ormation will require care coordination and clinical efficiencies that is supported by robust information systems. If HHC is to the meet these upcoming challenges we must have a fully integrated system of care; one which connects centers of excellence and one which can adapt quickly. Changes to our current system take months if not years to complete. There are cost implications of not making this investment as well. HHC has been approached by our incumbent EMR vendor because the vendor does not have en ough resources to work on both eligible provider meaningful use AND Stage II at the same time. HHC will be able to sustain Stage I and II for Hospitals with the current system. However, the long term ability of the vendor to support stage II and Eligible providers is unclear. The financial impacts of not meeting meaningful use are estimated at $70 million for E ligible Provider s (EPs) and Stage III will be worth approximately $40 million. In addition to risks to incentive funding, there are also risks of Medicare penalties (1% of total Medicare revenues in 2015 , which is approximately 9.6 million dollars) for not maintaining meaningful use. Through this Negotiated Acquisition, HHC will procure a new state of the art Electronic Medical Record solution that will increase patient safety through the use of efficient and effective decision support; that is scalable to the size and performance requirements of HHC, is able to meet the unique requirements and workflows of facilitie s and programs throughout HH C, is fo cused on secondary uses of data to improve patient care and outcomes; conforms with emerging and evolving HIT standards, and utilize s modern technology to allow for interoperability with foreign systems, RHIO's and other providers. The system will also streamline care delivery and elimi nate waste and manual processes. Each of these will, in turn, optimize care experiences for patients, care providers and staff. The ICIS EMR Project will be implemented at all eleven (11) HHC acute care hospitals, five (5) long term care/long -term acute care hospitals, six (6) diagnostic and treatment centers and over seventy (70) other community based clinics. More than 8 ,000 physicians, 2,500 residents, 9,000 nurses, and many other clinical professionals will dire ctly interact with the ICIS system on a daily basis and nearly all 39,000 of HHC's dedicated employees will be impacted by the new clinical system as well as the 1.3 million patients served annually by HHC. The ICIS solution will be an integrated EMR utilizing a single database within a single data repository. The application environment will cover all clinical and supporting service lines within the acute care, long term care, and hospital -based and non- hospital -based ambulatory care settings. It will integrate with other existing HHC clinical and enterprise applications and will have extensive business intelligence/reporting functionality. The solution will be implemented within a scalable highly -available environment with full disaster recovery cap abilities to minimize downtime. The existing E MR used at HHC is a legacy system, which has a decreasing market share and has shown several changes in ownership (HDS, Medaphis, Per Se, Misys, and now QuadraMed). In 2006, HHC reviewed the state of our current EM R in the marketplace. It found t here was significant executive turnover inclusive at the CEO level, minimal new client sales during the previous two years, the product had not kept pace with competition and competitive products ha d surpassed the incumbents' medical record functionality. Most recently, the lack of sufficient vendor resources was evident in the extended process leading to meaningful use. HHC 590B (R July 2011) 3 In 2008, HHC planned and initiated a Negotiated Acquisition for a new Electronic Medical Record and received proposals from nine vendors, which were narrowed to five vendors after prequalification in 2009: Allscripts, Cerner, Epic, McKesson and Siemens. Subsequently , the Federal Government announced Meaningful Use incentive funding. HHC estimated total potential incentives at $12 5,000,000 for hospital program. In 2010, HHC began preparing for Meaningful Use attestation with the incumbent system to avoid potential loss of incentive funding. In August 2011, the five vendors were narrowed to three after initial ratings based on vendor functionality and gap analysis: Allscripts, Cerner, & Epic. Finally in mid -2012 , HHC concluded that Epic offered the best proposal with the most integrated functionality . The contract costs are $ 2 15.4 million over the initial ten-year term and one $ 87.4 million five-year renewal option, for a total contract amount not to exceed $302,807,986 . HHC 590B (R July 2011) 4 CONTRACT FACT SHEET( continued) Contract Review Committee Was the proposed contract presented at the Contract Revie w Committee (CRC)? (include date): August 22, 2012 Has the proposed contract's scope of work, timetable, budget, contract deliverables or accountable person changed since presentation to the CRC? If so, please indicate how the proposed cont ract differs since presentation to the CRC: N/A HHC 590B (R July 2011) 5 CONTRACT FACT SHEET( continued) Selection Process: Please see Attachment A for list of selection committee members and firms that responded to NA. The Negotiated Acquisition for a new integrated clinical information system has been carefully designed to maximize stakeholder input with a focus on transparency and process integrity. In 2008, HHC planned and initiated a Negotiated Acquisition for a new Electronic Medic al Record and received proposals from nine vendors . HHC selected five leading vendors in 2009 during the prequalification phase followed by evaluations of the remaining vendors' full proposals. Through this comprehensive review process, the Selection Committee, (consisting of three Corporate Officers; Sr. Clinical Leadership representing Nursing, Medicine, Psychiatry, Long Term Care, Emergency Department, Informatics, and Pharmacy; along with the President's Chief of Staff, the Sr. Assistant Vice President of Finance and HHC's Chief Medical Officer), recommended two semi -finalists with one of them being the preferred vendor. The Selection Committee was reconstituted in 2011 and met approximately twice monthly from July 2011 until April 2012. Member roles i ncluded (1) oversight of the selection activities; (2) review of key vendor documents, market research, and key proposal content; (2) review of progress reports; (3) review of quantitative ratings of integrated vendor demonstration scripts; (4) review of function -specific product evaluations by HHC's expert workgroups; and (5) review of analysis provided by the negotiating team. The Selection Committee has (6) recommended two vendors to proceed to final nego tiation by the Negotiating Team to (7) review the results of the negotiation and (8) ratify and endorse the recommended vendor to the Corporation for ultimate consideration by the Board of Directors . Expert Work Groups: To accomplish the detailed review of the software HHC engaged a broad representation of stakeholders from across HHC's Clinical Councils and other business units. Eight expert workgroups were assembled to review the vendors written responses with respect to system functionality. The workgroups reported directly to the selection committee a nd include d approximately eighty individuals with experience managing and using electronic medical record systems. These workgroups are the same groups that contributed to the over 4,000 functional requirements questions contained within the request for fu ll proposals. Expert Workgroups provided their observations of each vendor's strengths and weaknesses through formal presentations to the selection committee . In addition to attending vendor demonstrations, these groups conducted additional product reviews , attended site visits and participated in reference calls. Expert workgroups provided their impressions of system functionality to the Selection Committee for review, including any significant concerns. The Negotiating Team has review ed other aspects of the Full Proposals including the vendor's current financial position, ongoing vendor investment in research and development, review of the product roadmap, ability and willingness of the vendors to comply with HHC's standard contract terms and other key in formation contained within the full proposals , including the total cost. This group negotiate d with the two semi -finalists and returned a final contract for consideration of the CRC . HHC 590B (R July 2011) 6 CONTRACT FACT SHEET(continued) Scope of work and timetable: The scope of work includes procuring a comprehensive Integrated Clinical Information System (ICIS ) to cover the majority of our Electronic Medical Records needs for all HHC facilities including Long Term Care, Acute Care Hospitals, and Ambulatory Care.

HHC 590B (R July 2011) 7 CONTRACT FACT SHEET ( continued) Provide a brief costs/benefits analysis of the services to be purchased. The Current level of QuadraMed spending, along with the new functionality that would be required to supplement the QuadraMed application , is significant. If HHC were to remain with QuadraMed, it would need to maintai n over 90 existing applications and implement ten to fifteen major new applications. Shown below is the fifteen -year software cost analysis performed to compare the proposed cost of software based on similar functionality. The analysis includes both of the Negotiated Acquisition finalist vendors : Allscripts and Epic . The outcome of this analysis, shown below, is that Epic was the best value due to the integrated functionality available in a single application. This allows HHC to use fewer applications to achieve the same functionality.

Indicate areas of under -representation and plan/timetable to address problem areas): Received By __May,2012_________ Date Analysis 5/10/2012 Date By Manassas Williams__________ Name 1 9/18/2012 EPIC Contract Presentation Summary Background In 2008, HHC determined that it needed to replace the current Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system and launched an initiative, code name iCIS, to replace the current fragmented and disconnected electronic health records with a new, state of the art system. i CIS - The Integrated Clinical Information System (iCIS) will be a single, standardized , enterprise -wide El ectronic Medical Record that will build upon the Corporat ion's twenty years of experience using EMR's . One of the key goals of ICIS is to unite and connect all of HHC's hospitals, community based clinics long term care facilities , centers of excellence, and even our patients. ICIS will be a single, standardized , enterprise -wide El ectronic Medical Record (EMR) that will meet HHC's need for an agile and dependable EMR for decades to come . Utilizing the collective knowledge of our staff and based in Breakthrough improvement and industry - standard technology implementation and management methods , HHC will maintain its reputation for excellence as a safety net organization and continue the transformation into a \"top notch\" Accountable Care Organizat ion. HHC's Accountable Care Organizations will require a highly developed Electronic Medical Record Systems to support complex care management and patient centered medical homes, manage cost , and eliminate waste while maintaining the best medical practice - in other words, to achieve the triple aim. Over its twenty -year life span , the current EMR has enabled HHC to maintain operations and even improve in some areas. H owever, the current system has old functionality, such as clinical documentation and a decision support engine, which have not changed significa ntly for over 20 years. During that same time HHC's need, for this and other functionality , keep s growing. At this pace, HHC will be no match for the fast paced healthcare e nvironment of the 21st Century. Other areas where the current EMR lacks functio nality in clude the emergency department, operating room, long term care, behavioral health, patient portals, and mobile access . The system also lacks the agility to support our complex integrated delivery system. Finally, th e vendor continues to have a l ow share of the EMR marketplace and falls below market expectations according to several industry authorities. iCIS will be implemented a cross every Acute, Ambulatory and Long Term Care Facility including our 80 community -based clinic s and all Behavioral Health areas (inpatient, outpatient, ED, mobile crisis, detox, etc). The advancements of iCIS will touch more th an 8,000 physicians, 2,500 residents, 9,000 nurses and nursing staff, and other healthcare professionals . iCIS will be ab le to adapt to the changing needs in healthcare and meet Federal, State , and Local regulatory requirements. Being the central plexus for the entire Public Health Hospitals across all of the five boroughs in New York City , iCIS is being designed with full redundancy both locally (within each facility) and even across State lines to assure constant availability in the event of anything from a minor downtime to significant disaster. It will integrate with existing HHC enterprise applications for exchange of data and will support advanced extensive business intelligence and up -to-the minute dashboards and reporting functionality. 2 9/18/2012 To put this in perspective, consider the case of Ms. Christie Jones. Ms. Jones is a 68 -year -old female with a histo ry of hypertension and angina who has recently suffered a small stroke. Previous to i CIS, the medical information regarding the care of Ms. Jones was contained in multiple systems making coordination of care difficult and validating the accuracy of her he althcare laborious . With iCIS, all of Ms. Jones' medical care will be captured within a single, robust, integrated EMR - from her arrival to the Emergency Department, admission as an Inpatient, and subsequent discharge, followed by care within the home an d through the ambulatory care services, iCIS will allow all her medications, diagnostics and laboratory tests and clinical documentation to be readily available across HHC . Ms. Jones is just one representati on of the 1.2 million patients, often with even more complex medical conditions, who will benefit from the integrated EMR. Selection Process An EMR purchase of this magnitude requires an extensive, comprehensive, and detailed selection process to ensure that the new vendor and product align strategically with HHC. The EMR's evaluation criteria were divided into three major components: proposed system solution, strategic business partnership, and operational and financial impact. 1. Proposed System Solution - EMR must m eet functional requirements, be intuitive and easy to use, support patient -focused care, provide 24/7 access to data, satisfy regulatory requirements, protect patient data privacy, and support health information exchange. Additionally, the vendor should not have failed implementations . 2. Strategic Business Partnership - Vendor compatibility based on i ntegrity and reputation, focus on enterprise clinical solutions, alignment with HHC vision, proven implementation methodology, and track record in delivering success . 3. Operational and Financial Impact - Cost components include: software licensing & maintenance , hardware & technical infrastructure , implementation staging & resources , and total cost of ownership . Participation To achieve the goals of an endeavor of this magnitude, the engagement and collaboration of both clinical and administrative personnel was essential. HHC engaged a broad spectrum of participants who were representative of every facility type and nearly every service. F ive groups to helped to evaluate the EMR vendors: 1. iCIS Selection Committee - The iCIS Selection Committee was composed of 15 members from HHC's senior leadership from the Networks and Central Office. The duty of this committee was to review the information gathered from the Demonstration participants and Ex pert Workgroup members and choose the EMR vendor that best fit HHC's needs. 2. Expert Workgroups - Eight Expert Workgroups were formed to review and evaluate each EMR's offering based on their extensive experience working at HHC and their experience with th e 3 9/18/2012 current EMR. Examples of expert workgroups include radiology, laboratory, and health information management. 3. Demonstration Participants - Consisted, on average, of approximately 120 clinical and 50 technical Network and Central Office staff members. Th e purpose of this group was to evaluate the initial two -day demonstration of the top five EMR vendors reviewed by HHC. 4. iCIS Negotiating Team - Formed by senior members of HHC Finance, IT, and Legal. This group reviewed and negotiated the terms and conditi ons of the two finalist EMR vendors. 5. Councils - Council members were kept abreast of the progress of the procurement at monthly council meetings which were attended by the iCIS team. These meetings were also used as an opportunity for engagement in some initial set of requirements gathering by the iCI S team. Proposed System Solution In June of 2011, five vendors were invited to a two -day clinical and technical session to review the functionalities of their EMR systems with HHC Participants. The five vendors were: 1. Allscripts 2. Cerner 3. Epic 4. McKesson 5. Siemens Each vendor was provided an identical, detailed clinical scenario and asked to demonstrate their EMR's functionality based on this scenario. HHC participants scored each vendor's demonstration based on their performance in the demonstration and t heir ability to meet the clinical documentation requirements as per the scenario. In August of 2011, based on their performance and scores, the iCIS Selection Committee narrowed the number of vendors to three Finalists: 1. Allscripts 2. Cerner 3. Epic From Septe mber 2011 to March 2012, members from HHC's Expert Workgroups conducted 33 additional review sessions with each finalist to evaluate their system on a more detailed granular level. These reviews included Clinical Documentation, Decision Support, Pharmacy, Laboratory, Ambulatory Care, Clinical Coding, Radiology, Peri-Op, HIM and Long Term Care. Technical reviews were also conducted to assess each system's ease of use and technological capability to support an organization as large as HHC. In addition to reviewing the EMR's functionalities, a small group of Expert Workgroup members attended two reference site visits per vendor to observe live systems at facilities similar in size and scope to HHC. 4 9/18/2012 Strategic Alignment Visits were also made by HHC's Executive Officers to each of the final three vendor's corporate headquarters. The purpose of these visits was to evaluate the alignment of the vendor's long -term strategic goals with HHC's long- term strategic goals. Costs Also during this period, a detailed analysis of each vendor's total cost of ownership (TCO) was conducted. The purpose of the TCO analysis was to evaluate all of the major components required to purchase and implement each EMR. In addition to each vendor's software costs, the TCO includes the additional software and accompanying hardware, interfaces and professional services required to install the new EMR throughout the Corporation. The evaluation of each vendor's costs was structured to provide equivalent comparisons between vendors (\"apples -to-apples\"). Final Evaluation In April 2012, the iCIS Selection Committee evaluated each vendor based on the detailed reviews, Reference and Corporate site visits, and Total Cost of Ownership. The preferred finalist and alternate finalist were determined by the tabulation of structured scorecards which were filled out by each Selection Committee member. Based upon the scores, Epic was voted as the preferred finalist, Allscripts the alternate finalist. Negotiations began in parallel between HHC and each finalist shortly thereafter and continued through August 2012. After negotiations with the finalist vendors, the cost differences between each vendor were de minimis. Based on extensive assessme nts of overall fit, goal alignment and cost, Ep ic was chosen as the finalist and presented to the Contract Review Committee meeting held on August 22 nd, 2012. The major advantages of choosing Epic include: 1. One patient Electronic Medical Record across HHC . Epic is able to extend its EHR func tionality into essential clinical areas, such as behavioral health, anesthesia/operating room, emergency department and long term c are and offer the only true INTEGRATED record. 2. Integrate s with the Soarian Financial System . 3. A Strong Company . Epic is a privately held corporation with substantial growth and little debt . It has been used by large and complicated healthcare systems across the United States and has high ratings in the m arketplace , including highest rated integrated EMR by KLAS, an industry authority on Health Information Technology ratings. Its business model consists of making their clients independent. Many EPIC Customers have received recognition from the Health Informati on Management System Society (HIMSS) and received the prestigious Davies Award. More Epic Clients have achieved the highest stage of EMR functionality, Stage 7, than all other vendors combined . Research has correlated advanced IT systems with improved pa tient safety and also with improved financial performance. EPIC will provide HHC with the technology to continue our tradition of achievements in Health Information Technology. 5 9/18/2012 Fifteen Year Cost Analysis Today, HHC has over 130 clinical applications an d many other clinical databases. This is a large number of clinical applications to manage. Even with this large number there remain significant gaps in several areas as noted earlier. T hese systems are often \"stand alone,\" meaning they do not communicate with one another. Not only is the status quo failing to meet HHC's information system's needs, this large portfolio of stand alone applications is costly to maintain. HHC spends between $24 and $30 million per year on its main clinical syste ms and an additional $6 million annually for all of the stand -alone applications in use today. There are additional costs for infrastructure to run all of these applications. If we add to this estimate, the cost of procuring even more applications need ed to fill the gaps of the status quo, the total fifteen year cost of ownership to maintain our current trajectory , including inflation, would be $1.28 billion over the next 15 years. This is compared to the total cost for the same time period to move to EPIC of $1.44 billion as detailed below. The first item is the 15-year contract cost with Epic of $302.8M, which includes software licenses ($60M) , professional services software maintenance ($204M) , and contingency ($15M) . The software licenses include perpetual enterprise licenses for all modules and third party licenses for Cache database and pharmacy database. Professional services include implementation support for first three networks and training. Software maintenance is annual maintenance for the modules and includes 24x7x365 support . This cost also includes unlimited use of portals and PHR's for patients and the use of HIE communication via RHIO's. These cost components are outlined in Table 1 Table 1: 15 -Year Epic Contract Cost Software Licenses Perpetual Enterprise Licenses for all modules Third Party Licenses for Cache Database & Pharmacy Database $60 Million Professional Services Implementation support for first 3 Networks (including DTC and LTC) Training $23.8 Million Software Maintenance Annual maintenance for modules - paid when implemented $204 Million Contingency $15 Million Total $302.8 Million As referenced above, th e total fifteen -year cost to migrate from the current trajectory to EPIC is $1.4B , which includes both new costs and the cost to maintain existing systems during the transition. A breakdown of these costs is shown in Table 2. 6 9/18/2012 Tabl e 2: Total Project Cost Analysis Contract Time Frame 15-Year Cost Epic Contract Term 2012 -2027 $303 Million QMED Continuation of current contract through 2017 $80 Million Third Party* Software To be installed over the next 5 years and funded through 2027 $144 Million Hardware* To be purchased over the next 3 years and replacements to be funded through 2027 $191 Million Interfaces* To be purchased over the next 3 years and replacements to be funded through 2027 $157 Million Implementation Support* Vendors to be identi fied through RFP; includes cost of non -IT Staff participation, training and clinical staff coverage $203 Million Application Support Team New and existing HHC Staff to be used through the implementation and maintenance period $357 Million Total $1,435 Million * Future contracts to be presented to the Board of Directors Compared to the fifteen -year total cost of ownership of the current system , implementing the new Epic system results in a net cost of $157 million. This net increase is primarily due to implementat ion costs as well as the cost involved with transitioning from one system to another . The bulk of this cost diffe rence can be funded by the CMS meaningful use incentive, which totals $125M. Implementation The iCIS Program is projected to be a five year implementation that will deliver an integrated clinical information system to each HHC acute care facility, diagnostic and treatment center and long term care facility. The Program will be structured according to the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) standards and managed according to the processes defined by the Project Management Institute . The project plan will be developed collaboratively with key HHC stakeholders and the selected EMR vendor. To guide the direction of program work and establish a common und erstanding amongst team members, t he following principles are set forth : 1. Provide strong clinical leadership and engage stakeholders throughout each phase of project 2. Maximize standardization by: Establishing a strong governance structure Following model co ntent & best practice guidelines Maintaining strict change control standards Implementing one enterprise- wide database By dividing the Program into phases, iCIS leadership will be able to effectively sequence and manage the broad scope and complexity of t he Program. The iCIS Program will consist of four phases : 7 9/18/2012 1. Initiation and Ramp Up - E nsure the appropriate planning is conducted and staffing levels defined 2. Enterprise Design and Build - The review, modification, and configuration of the vendor's out - of-the-box Model system to meet HHC's needs. The resulting product is the HHC Enterprise Model System, one that delivers standardized workflows and procedures throughout the Corporation. 3. Deployment to Facilities - The preparation for the installation and go -live of the new EMR at every HHC Facility. 4. Transition to Operations and Maintenance - The activities required to ensure a smooth transition to a fully operational and healthy electronic medical record system. Governance The Governance for this important project is currently being finalized . Strong project governance is one of the most critical components for success . The following are among the roles which will be established to ensure effective and timely decision making: iCIS Executive Sponsor Committee - Provides overall Program oversight including governance and decision -making on key elements of the Program scope . iCIS Program Leader - The cha mpion of the Program and provide s Corporate -wide ownership. Has ultimate r esponsibility for the success of the Program in fulfilling its mission. iCIS Program Director - Responsible for the overall planning, execution and control of the Program . Leads the Program Managers to mobilize and use the Program team to compl ete the Program successfully. Reports to the Program Leader. iCIS Program Management Team - Coordinate s and monitor s the execution of iCIS core activities and sub -project activities. M o bilizes and uses the p rogram team resources to complete the program s uccessfully. Reports to the Program Director. HHC's Clinical Councils - Will be incorporated into the program to provide clinical guidance over the design and build of the HHC Enterprise Model system. Budget Monitoring Program spending will be monitored and regularly reported by the Program Director and Project Management Team to the Budget Director of IT as well the Executive Steering Committee, Corporate Finance and Budget, Capital, and other committees as appropriate. Careful attention to budget availability and cash flow will be required to ensure that the project remains on time and on budget. Risk Management Uncertain events or condition s may have a negative effect on the program's timeline and budget. Adequate risk management is a critical success factor of the iCIS Program. In order to develop effective mitigation plans and responses, multi-dimensional risks that are inherent in the program will be estimated and assessed with sufficient qualitative and quantitative analyses. The methodology and 8 9/18/2012 process of managing program risks will be defined according to the Project Management Institute's Body of Knowledge. Robust Technology with Disaster Recovery and Security The infrastructure platform from which Epic will be run has been designed for high performance transaction speeds and high system availability. The proposed solution is the culmination of nine months of design and system capacity testing working directly with Epic and top tier hardware manufactures. A transaction speed service level agreement has been negotiated with all parties to assure medical staff will be able to perform their duties quickly and efficiently. The transaction speed estimates have been validated by performing specific system testing using a data set of similar size to what HHC can expect with Epic. Further the system includes instrumentation such that the transaction speed will be constantly monitored, allowing for action to be taken immediately if performance falls below present limits. Each element of the system has been designed for high performance and reliability. The selected hardware includes all possible redundant componentry. Major system elements such as servers, storage, and network equipment have been arranged in a fault tolerant redundant configuration following industry best practices for high availability. In the event of interruption of one server the workload will move automatically to another piece of equipment with zero impact to the end user. The design includes a fully duplicated running system located in secondary data center, allowing for full system processing to be switched to a secondary facility within a 1 to 2 hour time frame with data loss of less than 1 m inute. Security is another major consideration for this robust system. Prior to selecting Epic, HHC's security and infrastructure team did a thorough review of all technical and functional security parameters enabled through this technology . The syst em will allow HHC to comply with HIPAA standards as well as Meaningful Use Certification Criteria. In addition, security features were evaluated to determine their level of flexibility to protect specific types of information including highly sensitive i nformation . Change Management A key ingredient in the delivery of a quality solution is to ensure that all changes follow stringent change management procedures . The goal of the process is to ensure that standardized methods are followed for the efficient and prompt handling of all changes, minimizing the negative impact s of change . The change management process, when combined with other Information Technology Infr astructure Library (ITIL) standards -based processes, provide s the necessary guidelines and procedures to efficiently apply changes to the system. Whether the change is to establish/ update a configuration or fix a defect , the established Change Management P rocess will provide a consistent approach to the assessment of the impact of a change request, the associated risk, resource s required , and approvals needed. A Change Management Board consisting of senior members of the Corporation will be instituted to review and approve high impact changes. 9 9/18/2012 Communication As with any large program, iCIS' success will depend on transparent and effective communications both within and outside the HHC community. The iCIS Program will provide regular, timely and appropriate communications to the various stakeholder audiences that relate to the program.

The proposed certificate of incorporat ion is attached. The Corporation will be the sole member of HHC Finance Corporation and so will control its board. The board will initially consist of Alan Aviles, Laray Brown, Marlene Zurack, Antonio Martin and Salvatore Russo. Capitalization of The C orporation will capitalize the Finance Corp with $10, 661,000 Subsidiary: drawn from the Corporation's expense funds. Leveraged Loan The Finance Corp will make a loan of $10,661,000 to H HC and the \"A Loan\" Investment Fund, LLC, an entity created and controlled by U .S. Bancorp C ommunity Development Corporation (the \"Investment Fund\"). The Investment Fund will invest this sum in an intermediary company that will then loan the funds to the Corporation as the \"A Loan\" in the transaction. Terms of the \"A Loan\" 30 year loan; interest only for 7 years; interest at approximately 1.217%. Investor Loan or the \"B $4,339,000 will be invested by the Investment Fund in an Loan: intermediary and then loaned to the Corporation as the \"B Loan.\" Terms of the B Loan 30 year loan; interest only for 7 years; interest at approximately 1.217%. Use of Loan Proceeds The entire amount of the A Loan and approximately $2.670,714 of the B Loan, after paying (or reserving money to pay) a construction debt service account, will be available to the Corporation to supplement its construction budget and, specifically will make possible the construction of a Post- Partum Unit that had been part of the original construction plans for Harlem Hospi tal but that had been de-scoped due to insufficient funding. The Corporation will pay these sums to DASNY pursuant to work orders previously approved by the Corporation's Board. 6 Central Misc./Harlem NMTC/HHC Resolution.9.27.12 REVISED City Funding The City of New York is committed to funding in excess of $10,661,000 for the Harlem Hospital proj ect. These funds will, in effect, reimburse the Corporati on for its capitalization of the Finance Corp and subsequent use for payment to DASNY using the A Loan proceeds. Payment of Interest Interest payments on the two loans will be made from an account funded from the loan proceeds. The approximate amount of $2,670,714 Million available from the B Loan already reflects the deduction of a construction and debt service reserve. Payment of Loan The principal on the two loans does not begin to be payable and, Principal cannot be paid, until the end of the 7 th year following the loan closing. At that point, the princi pal on the two loans is to be re- paid over the remaining 23 years of the term of the loans. The Investment Fund may, however, require the Finance Corp to purchase the entire equity in th e Investment Fund for a price of $1,000 at the end of the 7 th year. If the Investment Fund were not to exercise its \"put,\" then the Fi nance Corp could elect to exercise a right to purchase the equity in the Investment Fund for a purchase price equal to its FMV at the time. Alternatively, the Finance Corp could elect to pay back the B Loan over the remaining 23 years at only its stated interest rate.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE STANLEY M. LEVENSON, M.D. BURN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT JACOBI MEDICAL CENTER The President of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation seeks authorization from the Board of Directors to name the Burn Intensive Care Unit (Burn ICU) on the 2nd floor of Bu ilding 6, the new inpatient building at Jacobi Medical Center (JMC) after Dr. Stanley M. Levenson who died in March 2012 after a career of almost 50 years as a clinician, researcher, educator and innovat or in the treatment of burns and other wounds and in the ro le of nutrition in wound healing. Dr. Levenson trained at Harvard Medical School ( 1937-41) and in 1942, as a Resident in the Burn Service and a Research Associate in Surgery at Boston City Hospital he found hims elf treating many of the victims of the horrific fire that destroyed the Coc oanut Grove nightclub and killed over 400 people. It was then that his lifelong dedication to im proving the clinical care of burn victims and his continuing involvement in research into the role of nutrition in wound care began. Dr. Levenson came to Jacobi in 1961 as an Attendi ng Surgeon, Board certifi ed in both Surgery and Nutrition. In 1971 he became the Director of Surgical Intensive Care Burn Unit and, as the Founder of the Burn ICU provided leadership for almost a quarter of a century. He was active as a clinician, administrator, educator and researcher throughout his long career in varying positions in the Department of Surgery at JMC. His development of pioneering protocols for the treat ment of burns and other wounds and his work on the role of nutrition in wound healing over this period earned him national recognition as an expert, brought countless numbers of young physicians to him for training and made the Burn ICU at Jacobi a unique center of excellence. In conjunction with the naming of the Burn ICU for Dr. Levenson, Jacobi Medical Center will develop public health and other educational material s around the care of burns and other wounds for the use of patients, their families and other visitors to t he Burn ICU. Dr. Levenson is so highly regarded by his colleagues and other physicians he has mentored and trained that it is anticipated that this permanent recognition of his renowned career will serve as an inspiration and attraction to future generations of physicians.

Work Order #2 was issued for $10.1m in February 2006, also for design phase services, which provided funding to procure architectural schematic design phase services for the Project. The selection process conducted by the Dormitory Authority State of New York (DASNY), with participation and approval of HHC, yielded Hillier Archi tects as the design professional. Hunter Roberts Construction Group (HRCG), was selected as the construction manager. Schematic design was completed by Hillier, and in January 2007, HHC approved the design. At that time, the project budget was established at $159m and approved by HHC. DASNY was to manage the project with the exception of four floors of rehabilitation work in the existing facility, which was to be managed by HHC. The approve d budget did not include the four floors to be managed by HHC, or consideration for furnishings, fixtures and equipment (FF&E). Funding for the project was (Work Order #3) was $38.5m. Construction documents were produced, and the first construction contract for soil rem ediation was awarded in June 2008. Foundations and structural steel were awarded following an 'early start' CON approval by DOH. HHC transferred responsibility of the four floors they were to manage to DASNY, and in October 2008 the Project budget was formally increased in writing to $182m, which included the original project scope plus the added four floors. Mechanical, plumbing, electrical and general construction fit out awards followed, after the CON approvals by DOH for D&TC and SNF, with the final major package (\"GHS 11\", representing the interior fit out) awarded in January 2010. This approved budget did not include consideration for FF&E. Funding for the project for Work Order #4 was raised to $60m. Subsequent Work Orders increased the Project's funding to $179.4m (Work Order #7), and with the inclusion of the Soil Remediation funding totaled $182 m. The Project's initial phase included the new construction component (ambulatory care center) and rehabilitation of the 13th floor of the existing facility, dedicated in September 2011. Subsequent phasing for the rehabilitation of floors 2 through 11 followed with additional Work Orders #8 and #9 issued to incorporate FF&E, project program changes and bid overage, bringing the Project funding to $207.2m by June 2011, with a scheduled Project completion date of April 2013. A combination of field conditions, program changes involving code required and infrastructure, design omissions, and the associated coordination of which had a negative impact on the Project's schedule and associated budget. By October 2011, this combination of events led to the extension of the Project schedule from April 2013 to September 2013. By July 2012, these same factors continued to impact the schedule, with the projected substantial completion date of March 2014.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PROJECT APPROVAL RENOVATION LINCOLN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT RENOVATION AND EXPANSION Authorizing the President of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (the \"Corporation\") to modify the Capi tal budget for the Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center Emergency Room Expansion and Annex by $9 million, increas ing the total project budget to $37.3 million. The Lincoln Emergency Room Expansion Project and Annex was developed as a two-phase project. The Annex phase of the project was completed at a cost of $15,270,000. The second phase of the project, encompassing ex pansion of the Emergency Department requires reallocation of capital funds to replace OTPS funds initially identified to fund the project. The project has been budgeted for $28,275,000 million in Capital funds. The work proposed to complete the Emergency Department requires the use of $9 million in additional Capital funding in lieu of OTPS funding. Funding for the additional cost of the project will be provided by reallocating capital funds from other HHC projects. It is intended t hat the capital projects adversely affected will be re-funded by the next HHC bond issue. The project will inc lude requi red swing space, fit-out, moveable equipment, environmental items, make-ready space and relocation costs and therefore increases the total project budget to $37.3 million. Lincoln Medical Center Emergency Department Renovation Project Chronology Originally the project was envisioned in two phases, the first a Medical Clinic Annex and the second the Emergency Department Renovation. The events that impacted the project are as follows: 1. Phase I - Annex a. Department of Health approval process was longer than originally anticipated b. Foundation and dewatering permit delayed by New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP ) c. Inclement weather while building envelope was under construction d. Certificate of Occupancy approval delayed due to issues with controlled inspection sign offs e. Certificate of Occupancy approval delayed due to Department of Buildings (DOB) internal audit. f. Moving Metropolitan from Generatio ns + to South Manhattan network resulted in a need to relocate personn el into the Annex eliminating the ability for it to be used as ED office swing space. 2. Phase II - Emergency Department Renovation a. Behavioral area of ED redesigned due to registration and financial offices inability to be relocated b. Mechanical systems on the third floor needed to be redesigned to accommodate Behavioral Health area c. Additional data closet needed due to expanded computer/network requirements d. Demolition was to be executed by inhouse forces, this option was no longer available requiring immediate change orders to the contractors upon award e. CON submitted on March 17, 2011 did not get approval until January 5, 2012 f. Existing violations delayed the General Contractor from obtaining DOB permits until February 1, 2012 g. Original budget did not include medical equipment, furniture, casework, initial cleaning, computers, phones, printers, monitors or security, these items were to be purchased with expense funds RESOLUTION Approving and ratifying bylaws adopted by HHC ACO Inc.'s Board of Directors, annexed at Exhibit A .
