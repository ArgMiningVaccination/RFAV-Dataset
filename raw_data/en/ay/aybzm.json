In the Ancient Norse tradition, they used Juniper in spiritual and shamanic healing, ritual purification, to invoke spirits and healing powers and to connect with their ancestors. Smudging is the burning of certain wood or herbs to create a cleansing smoke bath. This is done to purify a ceremonial and ritual space, ceremonial tools and objects (your mala beads or crystals) or to purify your home or a person. It is basically a ritual for cleansing, purifying and protecting the physical and spiritual bodies. And the effect of the smoke is to banish negative energies. Smudging can bring physical, spiritual and emotional balance. During the Juniper smudging ceremony, the healing smoke should be fanned over your space, object or person you wish to cleanse. I know some people use a feather, but since I am vegan I either use my hand or just gently wave the Juniper stick in the air. I do a Juniper Smudging Ritual in my home a few times a year, and my mala, crystals, oracle cards and my meditation alter whenever a feel a heavy energy. I feel that it is important to create a sense of ceremony when you are smudging. I usually start with a seated meditation, play my favorite yogic music or healing repeat a mantra and through the smudging ceremony I connect to my breath and keep my thoughts positive. I start at my front door and then walk clockwise through my house. Spend extra time in the corners as they tend to hold on to stagnate energy. As you walk through your house you can repeat \" I am cleansing out all negative energies and spirits, all negative energies and spirits must leave this house and do no harm \". I only use and sell the Swedish Native Juniper ( Juniperus Communis Suecica ). Not only is it a sacred pagan tree, it is also said that if there is a Norse Juniper in your house, the evil spirits will never enter your home. The Swedish Juniper has a clean and lovely aroma and a highly aromatic smoke. I have come across the Juniperus Osteosperma (native to the southwestern USA) but as lovely as that tree is, it does not have the same aroma. In Sweden we use juniper wood to make wooden utensils, like hot plates and butter knives. If you want to get a genuine Swedish Juniper knife, you can find it here (and oh, they also sell Juniper bookmarks!). Make sure you place your Juniper stick in a fireproof container. You can store sand in your container and dipping the stick into the sand when you are done. Do not use water, and do not try to blow on the stick (it is considered to be disrespectful).
