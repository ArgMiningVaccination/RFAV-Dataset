Training in Power Academy teaches a unique energetic healing system, incorporating course work, a meditation system that engages the 'active mind', and healing practice. Learners are introduced to the concepts and relationship between quantum physics, vibrational psychology and ancient energy systems and how to safely manifest a life of passion and personal wellness. Courses were first introduced in 1986 by [Faye Fitzgerald,](http://www.fayefitzgerald.com/) a University of Western Ontario graduate, social worker and advocate for vulnerable clients. Faye's original intent was to assist those in the healing, health care and social services areas, who were suffering from stress, anxiety, depression, addictions and other debilitating effects. In response, she developed a course that was simply called \"Level I\". Today there are eighteen Levels of training; a host of ancillary courses in specific areas of study; a Master Warriors Program; and various workshops. Heal the Self, Heal the World Our mission is to provide the tools and information for your self-empowerment and healing. To facilitate your learning, we offer a community of learning, self-discovery, and answers to all that may have seemed unanswerable in the past. The Training in Power community is a place to seek support, to offer support, and to honour your spirit. Why Train to Your Power? In our world, we are trained to focus only on what we can see with our eyes. We are often taught to ignore what we \"see\", \"hear\", \"feel\" and \"know\". Yet what goes on outside of us is determined by what goes on inside of us. Training in Power invites you to become reacquainted with your own true nature as a being of both the physical (matter) and of energy (spirit) - an energy which can be transformed. With these [courses](http://www.traininginpower.com/courses/level1/), you will transform your life through applying the science of power and healing systems that will free you from unhealthy patterns and habits and bring you to a deeper sense of your true Self. Ultimately you learn how to have conscious choice in your life once more.

For the full details, course descriptions and location of upcoming courses, please go to the [website.](https://www.traininginpower.com/) In My Words: Training In Power is a combination of healing, energetic awareness and safety tools, in which we utilize the power of meditation as a bridge from the conscious mind to the unconscious. We build in an architecture in the unconscious mind and guide you to your own power - the power within. With this systematic approach, we guide you into a rich inner world and that in the realm of the \"physics of thought\" and \"physics of Spirituality.\" The result is an expansion of your intuitive or psychic faculties, energetic safety, overall awareness and the proper placement of many key areas for you including the ego, Spirit, the negative voice in your head, fear, your divine rights, and even where you really came from and who you really are - just to name a few. Once you've chosen to do your Spiritual journey and embrace this new expansion of Self and your true, innate God given abilities, you'll be able to see frequencies, hear vibrations and connect with areas deep within yourself that have always been there, but that aren't detectable through our five senses and that we're not taught to connect with throughout traditional means of education. As you come into alignment with your essence, your Spirit Self, and let the programming -the physical reality that we call the human experience - fall away, you will be healthier, happier and propelled from one exciting, success and experience to the next.
