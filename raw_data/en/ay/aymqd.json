Crystal healing involves the placement of crystals on and around a person to unblock energy and encourage natural healing.", "sitename": "Therapy Directory", "date": "2023-08-30", "cleaned_text": "Crystal healing Crystal healing is a holistic and natural therapy that taps into the energetic power of crystals and how they affect the body and mind. A crystal therapist will place healing crystals on or around a client to help unblock, focus and direct energy. How does crystal healing work? Crystal healing is an [energy-based system](https://www.therapy-directory.org.uk/content/what-is-spiritual-energy-healing.html). This means it is based on the belief that we are all made up of different energies and that when this becomes stagnant, unbalanced, or blocked, it can cause illness. The premise is that crystals help unblock, balance, and direct energy where it is most needed, gently supporting the body to heal in a therapeutic way. Different types of crystals are thought to have different properties and energies. Just holding and being near these crystals is, therefore, thought to affect our own energies on a physical, spiritual, and emotional level. Crystal healers have extensive knowledge of the different stones and how they affect us and are able to use them in healing sessions. There are several different ways this can be done, but the most common is to have the client lie down and place the crystals on or around them in a specific way. The types of crystals used and their positioning will depend on what the client is seeking support for. This could range from a physical concern such as [headaches](https://www.therapy-directory.org.uk/blog/2018/07/26/self-care-for-headache-sufferers/) or stress to more emotional or spiritual concerns. What to expect in a crystal healing session The idea of crystal healing may sound far-fetched, but if you are open and willing to explore the world of energy healing, this is a wonderful place to start. It can also help to know what to expect before you book a session. Sessions will be tailored to you and will differ depending on the nature of your concern. Your session will begin with a consultation. This is when you speak with your crystal therapist about what's brought you to them and what you're hoping for. Your therapist will ask a number of questions; crystal healing is a holistic approach, meaning it looks at all aspects of health (physical, mental and spiritual) and so your therapist will want to get a full picture. Once you have had your consultation, your therapist will know what approach will work best for you, which crystals to use, and how to place them. You will be made comfortable and asked to lie down (fully clothed) on a sofa or on cushions on the floor. When you are relaxed with your eyes closed, your therapist will begin placing crystals on and around your body. Sometimes the therapist will use a dowsing pendulum to help them determine where the crystals should go. Crystals are a part of Mother Earth, connecting, balancing and harmonising. They also connect with all living things not only within but interconnecting with the energy fields around us too. - Therapist [Jacky Jueno]. The crystals will be left in place for a certain amount of time (this will depend on your circumstances but can be anywhere from 20 minutes to over an hour). During this time you are encouraged to breathe deeply and simply relax. Your therapist may add or remove crystals during the session. Some people report feeling sensations (a warmth or tingle) while others feel nothing. Don't worry if you don't feel anything, this doesn't mean your energies haven't been affected. When the session is over, your therapist will remove the crystals and you'll be encouraged to ground yourself in your body by becoming aware of your surroundings and physical sensations. Some people say they feel a difference in themselves immediately, for others it takes longer for the healing to take effect. You may be recommended a number of treatments and often people choose to have ongoing treatments to support their overall health. As the healing takes place, you may experience an energetic detox, when negative energy quickly leaves your body. This can lead to difficult emotions being brought to the surface, so it's important to ensure your crystal therapist is qualified and experienced to support you. How much does crystal therapy cost?

Crystal healing benefits Crystal healing is a complementary and natural approach, meaning it can be used alongside traditional medicine and has no negative side effects. The benefits of crystal healing are varied and take place on several different levels. Perhaps the most common benefit reported is the deep relaxation that takes place during a session. This type of relaxation helps aid general well-being and is particularly useful when treating stress and anxiety. It can also help ease tense muscles which can help improve physical pain and sleeping problems. On an emotional and spiritual level, crystals can help enhance self-esteem, encourage clarity and inspire a sense of peace and centredness.

Whether you're having crystal healing sessions or you just want to dip your toe in the water, having your own crystals at home can be incredibly beneficial. Let's look at what forms of healing crystals you can get: Cut crystals - when raw crystals have been cut and polished into certain shapes, including wands. These are usually more expensive than other types. Tumblestones - polished crystals that are smaller and widely available. These are often cheaper than cut crystals. Raw crystals - uncut and unpolished, these crystals come in chunks and aren't as shiny as other types. As they haven't been cut or polished, they tend to be the cheapest to buy. Cleansing and setting intentions Crystals naturally absorb the energy around them and so this can help to regularly cleanse them, energetically. There are several ways you can do this including burying them in the earth overnight, washing them in salt water, and putting them outside under a full moon. When your crystal is cleansed and ready to be used, you can set intentions for your stone. All this means is taking a few quiet minutes with your stone and setting an intention for how you want it to support you. For example, if you're struggling with the demands of your job, you may pick up a citrine crystal and set this intention: \"I want to feel more energetic, motivated and open to opportunities at work\". You can use Reiki energy to cleanse them and even if you are not trained in Reiki, you can simply hold the crystals between both hands, close your eyes and say out loud or in your head: \"I call a rain shower of divine healing light to cleanse these crystals, right now.\" - Therapist [Sophiero Healing - B-J Raben].
