All chains and wires are adjustable and come in a standard 1 meter ( 39 inches ) length. If you need a longer length: please contact us, and request one upon placing your order. LIGHTING RECOMMENDED MOUNTING HEIGHT A general rule of thumb is to hang the fixture 3 feet ( 36 inches ) above your table or kitchen island or 6 to 8 feet ( 72 - 96 inches ) off the floor. For ceiling height measuring 10 feet or less: Your light fixture must be less than 27 inches tall. For ceiling height measuring more than 11 to 16 feet: Your light fixture can range between 27 inches to more than 40 inches tall. If a ceiling is two stories tall, the chandelier should be have two or three tiers, and hang at least 7 feet above the floor. MEASURING FOR YOUR SPACE Use the following formulas as a guide: Room Length + Width = Diameter of Chandelier Room Height Floor to Ceiling x 2.5 = Height of Chandelier Hang Chandelier: 7 to 8 feet ( 84\" to 96\" ) from floor. LIGHTING INSTALLATION Professional installation by a licensed professional electrician with experience with handling LED drivers is recommended for all our lighting. Luminaire ceiling boxes are typically rated for 50 lbs. of weight. Metal boxes, with a \"Rated for Fan Support\" stamped inside typically hold 150 lbs. of weight. Please verify your electrical system with a professional to ensure that the chandelier will not require additional reinforcements or special mounting hardware. Most of our chandeliers come with a standard 1-meter adjustable wire or chain. If using a fixture in a two-story space: please specify when ordering, and contact us for a custom length. All of our products are 100% genuine K9 crystals with flawless workmanship, precision cutting, and clarity. Crystal assembly is required. Many of our products are hand-forged and may vary in appearance. ABOUT LED LIGHTING What are LEDs and how do they work? LED stands for Light Emitting Diode. LED lighting products produce light up to 90% more efficiently than incandescent light bulbs. How long do LEDs last? LEDs are notable for being extremely long-lasting products. Many LEDs have a rated life of up to 50,000 hours. This is approximately 50 times longer than a typical incandescent, 20-25 times longer than a typical halogen, and 8-10 times longer than a typical CFL. - How to determine the chandelier's diameter Measure spaces' length and width in feet, sum them up and that will be approximate diameter for the chandelier in inches. For example: 16 feet (Room Length) + 8 feet (Room Width) = 24 feet; The chandelier should be about 24 inches for its diameter - How to determine the chandelier's height Measure the space's floor to ceiling distance in feet, multiple by 2.5 will be approximate height for the chandelier in inches. For example: 11 feet (Room Height), 11*2.5 = 27.5 The chandelier should be about 27.5 inches for its height - How to determine how high should the chandelier to be hanged If you are hanging the chandelier on an open floor, chandelier's bottom should at least be 7 feet away from the floor. If you are hanging the chandelier above a dining table, chandelier's bottom should be 30 to 36 inches away from the tabletop. Other rules which can apply for different type of spaces. Dining Room If you are hanging the chandelier above your dining table, you can also decide the size of the chandeliers based on the size of your dining table. We generally recommend that the width or diameter of the chandelier should be between 1/2 and 2/3 of the width of the dining table. For example, let's say that you have a dining table with 32 inches in width and 66 inches in length. - If you are choosing a round chandelier, its diameter should be between 16 (32 x 1/2) to 21 (32 x 2/3) inches. - If you are choosing a rectangular chandelier, its width should be between 16 to 21 inches and length should be 33 to 44 inches (Same here 1/2 to 2/3 of the dining table length) Two-Story Foyer with Staircase Beside the general rule that the chandelier's bottom should be at least 7 and half feet away from the floor. For two story, what you also need to consider is that how will it look from the second floor. In general, staircase chandeliers will be a good choice for the space. In term of placing, below are two commonly seen guidance: - The general guideline is to use the second floor as a reference point. Hanging the chandelier slightly lower than or at the top of the staircase. This way, when you are at the top of the staircase, the top of the chandelier will be at your eye-level. - On the other hand, there are many designers who advocate for independent placement just to make the chandelier the focal point or placing the chandelier in relation to another architectural features. For example. if there is a large transparent window above the door, it should be centered in the window for best visual result from outside. Long Hallways Chandelier size for hall ways should be determined by the width of the hallway. Multiple the hallway's width in feet by 2.5 will be the diameter of the chandelier in inches. For example, the hallway's width is 8 feet. The chandelier's diameter should be about 20 (8 x 2.5) inches If you want to decorate with chandelier for your long hallways. We always recommend having them - Centered in the middle of the hallway - Spaced between 8 and 10 feet apart - At least 7 and half feet clearance from floor to bottom of chandelier.
