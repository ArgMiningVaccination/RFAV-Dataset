We dissect how these influences of sex modify the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple drugs and provideexamples for common drugs acting on specific organ systems. We also discuss how gender of physicians and patients may influence the therapeutic response todrugs. We aim to highlight sex as a genetic modifierof the pharmacological response to drugs, which shouldbe considered as a necessary step toward precisionmedicine that will benefit men and women.

Introduction Historically, women 's health was nicknamed \"bikini medicine \"because medical practitioners considered the only thing making women biologically different from men to be those body parts that could be coveredwith a bikini (Talesnik, 2018). For the safety of women and their offspring, women of fertile age were excluded from clinical trials, turning male physiol- ogy into the reference of the species in medicalresearch and drug discovery (Clayton, 2016). In1993, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Revitali-zation Act in the United States mandated the in-clusion of women in NIH-funded clinical trials, butmany investigators did not follow this policy or failed to analyze the results by sex (Schiebinger et al., 2016; Geller et al., 2018), minimizing the effectiveness ofthis mandate. Preclinical drug discovery has alsopredominantly used male cells and animal models(Danska, 2014; Klein et al., 2015; Mauvais-Jarviset al., 2017). Perhaps as a result of these failures toconsider sex in basic and clinical research, in 2001,a US Government Accountability Office report found that 80% of prescription drugs withdrawn from the market between 1997 and 2000 exhibited greateradverse effects and toxi c i t yi nw o m e nt h a ni nm e n (http://www.gao.gov/). To correct this error, in 2014,the NIH took the next step to mandate researchers toconsider sex as a biologic variable in basic researchby including both sexes in research designs (Claytonand Collins, 2014). Still, the field of sex-based biology and medicine is wrongly considered as peripheral and superficial. In this review, we outline the fundamental genetic and hormonal differences be t w e e nm a l e sa n df e m a l e sa n d the resulting differences i n pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) between male and female bi-ologic systems. We also provide examples of sex-specificresponses to drugs acting on different organ systems. Finally, we discuss the effect of physician and patient gender in drug response. II. Genetic and Hormonal Basis Sex differences in physiology and pharmacological response to drugs begin during development fromthe interaction between genetic and hormonal eventsand they continue after puberty. They stem from thecombination of three major events that have beenrecently reviewed (Mauvais-Jarvis, 2015, 2017, 2020)and are briefly described below. A. Sex Chromosomes The effect of sex chromosomes begins after fecundation in embryos carrying either XX or XY sex chromosomes (Arnold, 2017). The X and Y chromosomes are derivedfrom an autosomal chromosome pair but have evolvedseparately such that the only region that still under-goes recombination between X and Y chromosomes isthe pseudoautosomal region. As a result, the male-specific region of the Y chromosome carries genes that are not present in XX cells. The Y chromosome also carries some genes that are homologous to genespresent on the X chromosome (e.g., ZFY vs. ZFX andUTY vs. UTX), but because of independent evolutionon the X and Y, these gene pairs may exhibitdifferential expression or function. Male-female dif-ferences also arise because of the presence of two Xchromosomes in females versus a single X chromo- some in males. The random inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in female cells prevents differencesin X chromosome gene dosage between male andfemale cells for most genes. However, some X-linkedgenes escape inactivation in females (12% -20% in humans), and therefore those genes are expressed athigher levels in females than in males (Arnold,2017). Differences also exist in the epigenetic marks that are inherited on the X chromosome in males and females. In males, the X chromosome carries mater-nal imprints, which are epigenetic marks that areestablished ( \"imprinted \") in the parental germ cells (sperm or egg cells) and maintained in the somaticcells of the offspring, where they influence theexpression levels of specific genes. Females inheritX chromosomes from both parents and therefore carry both maternal and paternal imprints, which alter the expression of a different group of genesthan males. Thus, there are fundamental differencesin gene expression in human male and female cellsresulting from genetic heterogeneity between the Xand Y chromosome gene dosage as well as parent-of-origin inheritance of epigenetic marks. These sexdifferences persist throughout life and likely con- tribute to sex differences in the pharmacological response to drugs. B. Testicular Testosterone Surge The testis-determining sex-determining region Y gene on the Y chromosome drives the development of testes in males (Arnold, 2017). The differentiatedtestis produces a testosterone surge in the secondtrimester of pregnancy in humans (Forest et al., 1976; Corbier et al., 1992). This surge is critical to mascu- l i n i z et h er e p r o d u c t i v et r a c ta n dt om a s c u l i n i z ea n ddefeminize the brain struct ure and function through the organization of neural circuits responsible for theactivation of male behavior at puberty (Arnold andGorski, 1984; Morris et al., 2004; McCarthy et al.,2009). This organizational effect of testosterone onneural circuits is likely to promote sex differences in the response to neurotropic drugs. Notably, in animal models, developmental testosterone produces epige-netic modifications of histone marks (Sinha et al.,2020) and programs body composition and the mass732 Mauvais-Jarvis et al.and function of adipose tissue, liver, and kidney in adults (Nilsson et al., 1998; Abbott et al., 2005; Noharaet al., 2011, 2013), which likely influence sex differencesin the PK and PD of drugs. C. Pubertal Gonadal Hormones Most sex differences in biology and pharmacology are believed to be the consequence of the gonadal hormones after the onset of puberty. Although theseeffects are reversible, they are the most potent factorsthat make male and female tissues different in re-sponse to drugs. Testosterone is the main male gonadal hormone, whereas 17 b-estradiol and proges- terone (P4) are the main female gonadal hormones. The actions of these sex hormones on pharmacokinet-ics and pharmacodynamics will be described in thenext section. In summary, the combination of all sex-specific influ- ences on cells results in different in vivo environmentsfor male and female cells. Notably, genome-wide tran- scriptome analysis has demonstrated that there are sex biases in expression of genes across the genome; thisincludes genes that are conserved across mammalianspecies, and the differential expression levels in malesand females contribute to sex differences in humantraits (Naqvi et al., 2019). In addition, profiling of sexdifferences in serum metabolites revealed major sexdifferences in concentrations for over three-quarters of the metabolites studied (Mittelstrass et al., 2011). The sum of all genetic and hormonal sex-specific influencesthat affect cellular systems and alter the transcriptome,proteome, and metabolome \u2014known as the \"sexome \" (Arnold and Lusis, 2012) \u2014is likely to confer sex differ- ences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamicsof drugs, as we discuss below. III. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics A. Pharmacokinetics Sex differences in PK are well described and reported in numerous reviews (Anderson, we provide an update of themost well characterized sex differences in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of drugs. They are summarized in Supplemental Table 1. 1. Absorption. Drugs can be administered through numerous routes. The oral route is the most common, although this route poses complications regardingreaching the intended pharmacological target. In gen-eral, drugs are absorbed in the gut and reach the liverthrough the portal circulation. Thus, the oral bioavailabil- ity of a drug depends on first-pass liver metabolism or presystemic metabolism and drug degradation. Duringthis process, a portion of th e drug is lost. For example, propranolol, spironolactone, and lidocaine undergo a sig-nificant first-pass liver metabolism. men, propranololmetabolism is stimulated by testosterone, whereasin women androgen and estrogen do not modify themetabolism of this bblocker (Walle et al., 1994). Gastric secretion and emptying are important for drug absorp- tion. Gastric secretion is higher in men than in women, whereas gastric and intestinal emptying time is shorterin men than in women (Soldin and 2011; Franconi and Campesi, 2014a). Atbaseline, the higher gastric pH of women can elevate theionization of weak acids (e.g., aspirin), attenuating theirabsorption. It can also decrease the ionization of weakbases (e.g., caffeine), increasing their absorption (Soldin et al., 2011; Franconi 2014a). The longer time of gastric and in-testinal emptying in women suggests that they shouldwait longer than men after eating before taking drugsthat should be administered on an empty stomach. Thisis observed with captopril and felodipine (Whitley andLindsey, 2009). Little information is available on the influence of sex on drug absorption for routes other than oral adminis-tration. Still, intramuscular absorption seems to beslower in women than in men. For example, intramus-cular aspirin is absorbed more slowly in women than inmen (Aarons et al., 1989). Interestingly, there is a sexdifference regarding the site of intramuscular injection:After in gluteusmaximus, vastus lateralis, or deltoid muscles, the area under the curve of drug concentration in plasma as a function of time and absorption rate is smaller inwomen than in men, the difference being the strongestwhen intramuscular injection is performed in thegluteus maximus (Vukovich et al., 1975). Notably, thedepth of gluteal fat varies between men and women(Cockshott et al., 1982; Dayananda et al., 2014), but thelength of the injection needle does not vary. In women, the rate of success of intramuscular injections is lower than in men (Soliman et al., 2018). In addition, sexdifferences are described in the composition of skeletalmuscle fiber type. In particular, women have a highercapillarity for type II fibers in the vastus lateralis thanmen (Croley et al., 2005). In women, type II fibers havehigher fiber type -specific capillary length than in men (Lyon et al., 2007). This is associated with over 3000 genes differentially expressed in male and female muscle (Welle et al., 2008; Haizlip et al., 2015). Togetherthese studies highlight the complex differences thatexist in skeletal muscle from both sexes and which maybe associated with differences in blood flow and in-tramuscular drug absorption. Some drugs (clonidine, nitroglycerin, steroid hor- mones) can be administered transdermally. Sex differ- ences exist in the integrity and barrier qualities of the skin (Singh and Morris, 2011). For example, womenhave more subcutaneous adipose tissue than men andmale keratinocytes, and skin pores are larger in malethan in female skin (Soldin et al., 2011). However, theSex-Based Pharmacology 733paucity of data does not permit any clear conclusions about sex-based variations in transdermal absorption.The transdermal absorption of nitroglycerin is influ-enced by body weight, which is higher in obese subjects of both sexes. However, nitroglycerin-induced temper- ature elevation has been reported especially in womenwho are obese (Haebisch, 1995). Given that skinparameters involved in drug absorption, such as hydra-tion, transepidermal water loss, sebum, microcircula-tion, pigmentation, pH, and thickness, differ betweenmen and women (Rahrovan et al., 2018), the trans-dermal absorption drug is likely to be sexually biased. Finally, there is a paucity of data on the effect of sex in pulmonary absorption (Soldin and Mattison, 2009;Soldin et al., 2011), although the architecture of theairways exhibits numerous sex differences (LoMauroand Aliverti, 2018), and therefore sex differences inpulmonary absorption are likely to occur. 2. Distribution. The distribution of a drug is essen- tial to reach its target site and depends on several factors that differ between women and men (Table 1). Compared with men, women are smaller and havea lower total body water volume, extracellular andintracellular water volumes, total blood volume, redblood cell content, cardiac output, and organ blood-flow rate, all of which influence the volume of distri-bution of a drug (Vd) (Fadiran and Zhang, 2015). Inpremenstrual and in late luteal phases, water retention and hyponatremia are observed, and this alters Vd (Ciccone and Holdcroft, 1999). Interestingly, isosorbidedinitrate \u2014a drug used to prevent chest pain in patients with coronary artery disease \u2014penetrates red blood cells where it is metabolized, and the metabolic rate ishigher in men than in women. Thus, penetration in redblood cells not only modifies drug distribution but mayalter drug metabolism, and this seems to be influenced by sex (Bennett et al., 1983). The Vd is also influenced by plasma protein binding (Soldin and Mattison, 2009). Endogenous and exoge- nous levels of a-1 acid glycopro- tein (Kishino et al., 2002), which binds neutral drugsand is the primary carrier of basic drugs, such aslidocaine. As a result, the amount of free lidocaine inthe plasma of women treated with oral contraceptives (OCs) is significantly higher than in men of similar age (Routledge et al., 1981). Albumin does not vary betweensexes, and there is no significant sex difference inalbumin drug binding (Routledge et al., 1981; Soldinand Mattison, 2009; Soldin et al., 2011). Body composition diverges between the two sexes: Women have a greater amount of fat mass, whereasmen have a greater amount of lean mass, and this difference decreases with age (Soldin and Mattison, 2009; Soldin et al., 2011). Therefore, if men and womenreceive the same dose of a water-soluble drug, the Vdwill be higher in men who have greater lean massand total body water volume. Conversely, the Vd of TABLE 1 Sex-specific effects of cardiovascular drugs Drug/Substance Sex- and Gender-Related Aspects References Heart failure Digoxin Greater mortality in women with HFrEF than in men in post hoc analysis Diamanti-Kandarakis et al.

Thus lipid-solubledrugs, such as amiodarone, lidocaine, procainamide,and digoxin, max(peak women, elevating the risk of adverse drugreaction (ADR) (Stolarz and Rusch, 2015), especially with long-term therapy. 3. Metabolism. The first pharmacological sex differ- ence was described in 1932, when Nicholas and Barrondescribed that the hypnotic effect of hexobarbital lastedlonger in female rats than in male rats (Nicholas andBarron, 1932). Years later, Quinn et al. (1958) showed that it depended on the metabolism of hexobarbital. In particular, the presystemic metabolism may divergebetween sexes. This is the case for the calcium-channelblocker verapamil (Dadashzadeh et al., 2006), as nor-verapamil production is higher in women than in menbecause of higher activity of CYP3A4 or lower activity ofP-glycoprotein in women. P-glycoprotein is located inthe gut, liver, and kidney and mediates drug efflux out of the cells. At the level of the intestinal epithelium, it reduces the absorption of numerous drugs, includingdigoxin (Shi et al., 2011). The liver is the main site of drug metabolism, which depends on cardiac output and liver blood flow, both ofwhich are lower in women than in men. It also dependson phase 1 and 2 drug-metabolizing enzymes andtransporters that exhibit sex differences in expression and activity (Soldin and Mattison, 2009; Soldin et 2012; and Campesi, 2014a,b)(summarized in Supplemental Table 1). The expressionand activity of these enzymes and multidrug resistanceprotein are regulated by endogenous factors, such asgenetics, age, sex, sex hormones, and microbiota, aswell as by exogenous factors, such as drugs, diet, andenvironmental pollutants, which in part act through the nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor, pregnane X receptor, and aryl androstane receptor, and pregnane Xreceptor exhibit sexually biased expression and mode ofaction (Hernandez et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2013). Bota-nicals may also induce CYP enzymes through thesenuclear receptors, which is of special interest in women because they are the most prevalent users of botanicals (Campesi et al., 2019). In particular, focusing on374 drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters ina published gene expression data set of human male(n= 234) and female ( n= 193) liver samples, Yang et al. (2012) identified 77 genes showing differential expres-sion due to sex. Finally, the gut microbiota have recentlyemerged as an important player in drug metabolism and drug interactions in a sexually dimorphic manner (Carmody and Turnbaugh, 2014). This will be discussedfurther in a later section. 4. Elimination. Renal elimination depends on tubu- lar secretion, reabsorption, and glomerular filtration rate,which are lower in women than in men (Soldin andMattison, 2009). It also depends on body weight (Soldinand Mattison, 2009). Drugs that are mainly or exclusivelyexcreted unchanged by the renal route are cleared more slowly in women than in men (Schwartz, 2003). This is the case of commonly used drugs, such as gabapentin,pregabalin, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoro-quinolones, or vancomycin, all of which have showndecreased renal clearance in women (Anderson, 2005;2008). Other remarkable examples are methotrexate(Schwartz, 2003) and digoxin (Yukawa et al., 1997),which have a 17% and 13% slower clearance in women, respectively. Similarly, the anticoagulant lepirudin, exhibits a longer half-life in women (up 48 hours) thanin men (2 hours), which increases the risk of bleeding inwomen (Abdel-Rahman, 2017). Being aware of thesedifferences may allow the prescription of lower dosagesof these medications based on glomerular filtrationrate (GFR) in women to avoid adverse effects. Sex differences in expression of drug transporters in human kidney also contribute to changes in sex-specificpharmacokinetics. In a study of human kidney, 23 genescoding for drug transporters exhibited sex differences intheir mRNA expression. Twenty-one of them wereexpressed at higher levels in men, whereas two wereexpressed at higher levels in women (Joseph et al.,2015). 5. Influence of the Gut Microbiome. The absolute bioavailability of a drug administered orally is often lessthan 100% and typically less than 60%. Thus, thegastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is likely to be exposedto drugs during oral administration. In fact, the efficacyof some drugs may be enhanced or worsened becausethey modulate the GI microbiome. Recent data demon-strate sex differences in the GI microbiota populationsof rodents (Bernbom et al., 2006; Markle et al., 2013) and humans (Li et al., 2008; Dominianni et al., 2015). The sexually dimorphic GI microbiome may alterexposure to a drug in females differently than malesby differentially modulating digestion, absorption, dis-tribution, and elimination. Men have faster mean GItransit rates, greater stool weights, greater bile acidexcretion, and less fiber fermentation than women(Lampe et al., 1993). The opposite appears to be true in mice. Male mice consuming a control chow have slower gastric emptying and GI transit rate thanfemale mice (France et al., 2016). Conjugation ofxenobiotic drugs, such as st eroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with sugars is an impor- tant mechanism for detoxifi cation and clearance. If the conjugates are secreted from the hepatobiliarysystem into the small intestine, they can be deconju- gated by b-glucuronidase of several commensal bac- teria species in the gut and reabsorbed (Leung et al., 2001; LoGuidice et al., 2012). Sex differences inabundance of such taxa are reported (Haro et al., GI microbiome may modulate pharmacokinetic Sex-Based Pharmacology 735properties of drugs, particularly those administered orally. 6. Influence of Sex-Specific Factors. In women, PK is influenced by endogenous or exogenous sex hor- mones, menopausal hormone therapy, and xenobiotics, including phytoestrogens, which influence hormonalstatus. In particular, exogenous sex hormones maymodify b-estradiol attenuates CYP1A1/2 gene expression via inhibit ion of AhR transcription (Lai et al., 2004), and treatment with OC may require a modification of the dosage to avoid overdosing or underdosing. In women, oral absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination can be influenced by the phase of themenstrual cycle, pregnancy, and lactation. We focus onpregnancy because 1% -2% of pregnancies are compli- cated by cardiovascular diseases and because morewomen with congenital heart diseases survive reaching reproductive age (Regitz-Zagrosek et al., 2018). In addition, at least in Western countries, pregnancy atan advanced age is increasing, and age may increasecardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension (Regitz-Zagrosek et al., 2018; Cooke and Davidge, 2019). During pregnancy, the physiology of women changes in a time-dependent manner, and these changes alterPK and PD (Supplemental Table 1). In pregnancy, there are additional compartments \u2014the fetus and the amni- otic fluid \u2014that may lead to increased drug accumula- tion and to an apparent increase in Vd of certain drugs (Feghali et al., 2015). Furthermore, cardiac output isenhanced beginning in the first trimester, whereasglomerular filtration rate is increased by 50% startingin the second trimester and until 3 months postpartum.Therefore, during pregnancy, the clearance of drugs that are excreted unchanged in the urine, such as heparin, is increased (Ansari et al., 2016). Furthermore,liver enzymes involved in drug metabolism are in-creased in expression and activity, resulting in en-hanced in drug metabolism (Supplemental Table 1)(Ansari et al., 2016). For example, pregnancy inducesCYP2D6, resulting in increased metabolism of meto-prolol, a bblocker, and thus plasma levels of metoprolol are reduced in women who are pregnant compared withwomen who are nonpregnant (Ansari et al., 2016). A fewliver drug metabolism enzymes exhibit decreased ac-tivity (Supplemental Table 1), such as CYP1A2, whichis the primary enzyme for caffeine metabolism (Ansariet al., 2016). Finally, the placenta and fetus can alsometabolize drugs, thus participating in the changes indrug PK associated with pregnancy (Ansari et al., 2016). The effect of pregnancy on drug transporters is not well understood (Moyer et al., 2019). Significant hormonalchanges that can modify PK profile also occur in womenwho are menopausal and in women taking menopausalhormone therapy. For example, intestinal CYP3A4activity is reduced by about 20% during menopause,reducing the first-pass effect for substrates of (Paine et al., 2005). Conversely, inadult men, testosterone remains quite stable and has minimal effects on PK parameters. Additionally, the excipients [small or large molecules present in the final drug, defined by the US Food and Drug Administration as \"inactive \"substances] can have a role in inducing sex differences in PK. For example,the bioavailability of ranitidine, a selective histamineH2-receptor antagonist, is enhanced by polyethylene glycol in healthy men but not in women (Ashiru et al., 2008). These results suggest the complexity of sex influences in the context of drug delivery. Finally, and most importantly, PK is largely influ- enced by stress, which exhibits a strong sexual di-morphism (Kokras et al., 2019). Stress can modifygastrointestinal function, metabolism, lipid distribu-tion, blood flow, albumin binding capacity, and renale x c r e t i o n( K o k r a se ta l . ,2 0 1 9 ) .T h i si so fp a r t i c u l a r relevance in women who are more frequently exposed to some types of stress conditions than men (AmericanPsychologic Association, 2017). B. Pharmacodynamics Sex differences in PD are less studied than sex differences in PK. In part, this is a consequence of a lower number of women being included in clinical trials than men and the predominance of male animals used in preclinical studies (Franconi et al., 2015, 2017,2019; Regitz-Zagrosek et al., 2017; 2017). Here, wediscuss sex differences in PD with focus on cardiovas-cular signaling and the influence of the gut microbiome. 1. Renin-Angiotensin System. Regarding the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, sex differences are not limited to the receptors but also involve the synthesis of the components of this system (Ahmed et al., 2019).Preclinical evidence indicates that the renin-angioten-sin-aldosterone system is under the control of sexhormones: Estrogens increase angiotensinogen levelsand the number of angiotensin 2receptors and decrease renin levels, increased ACE,and aldosterone production as well as the number of angiotensin II receptor type 1 receptors (Hilliard et al., 2013). Although the role of androgens is poorly studied,testosterone appears to improve renin levels and ACEactivity (Fischer et al., 2002; Komukai et al., 2010). Inaddition, women who are premenopausal have lowerrenin levels than their male counterparts and womenwho are postmenopausal (Schunkert et al., 1997). Thesesex differences may lead to differences in drug treat- ment efficacy and adverse reaction between the sexes (see section A. Pharmacokinetics ). 2. Adrenoreceptors. In the case of adrenoceptors, sex differences are due to estrogens. Vessels of female ratsconstrict less and relax more in response to adrenergic736 Mauvais-Jarvis et al.stimulation compared with males; this sex differences is eliminated by ovariectomy in female rodents (Riedelet al., 2019). Ovariectomy elevates norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction and reduces isoprenaline and b 3-agonist vasorelaxation, and this is associated with reduction of mRNA of b1andb3receptors. Estrogens restore sex-specific differences in b1- and (Riedel et al., 2019). Moreover, the a-adrenergic constriction is lower in human mammary artery from women than it is from men, and this sexdifference disappears with aging (Al-Gburi et al., 2017).Some authors reported that norepinephrine reduces f o r e a r mb l o o df l o wm o r ei nm e nt h a ni nw o m e n , whereas flow increases more in women after selectiveb-adrenergic stimulation (Kneale et al., 2000; Dart et al., 2002). 3. Endothelin Receptors. The expression of endothe- lin (ET) receptor subtypes exhibits sexual dimorphism,even after menopause. Saphenous veins isolated frommen have higher ET receptor density than those isolated from women (Mouat et al., 2018). Thus, the maximum binding capacity for ETA and ETB receptorsis lower in women than in men (Ergul et al., 1998). Theratio of ETA to ETB is also higher in men (3:1) than inwomen (1:1), which explains the stronger vasoconstric-tion induced by endothelin-1 in men than in women(Mouat et al., 2018). There are clinical implications, aswomen with pulmonary arterial hypertension treated with antagonists of ET receptors (ambrisentan, bosen- tan, sitaxsentan) seem to respond better than men(Gabler et al., 2012). 4. Arachidonic Acid Cascade and Aspirin. Arachidonic acid can be liberated by phospholipases A2,C, and D locally lipoxins,and hepoxylins and is a substrate of CYP. The arachidonic acid cascade is regulated by estrogens that decrease theactivity of cyclooxygenase 1 and cyclooxygenase 2through the G protein -coupled estrogen receptor (Mouat et al., 2018). In healthy men, acute testoster-one treatment increases the density of thromboxaneA2 receptors in platelets, thus increasing plateletaggregation (Ajayi et al., 1995). In contrast, estrogens desensitize thromboxane receptors (Mouat et al., 2018). In human endothelial cells, estradiol elevates t h eg e n e r a t i o no fp r o s t a c y c l i ni nad o s e - d e p e n d e n tmanner, which is inhibited by tamoxifen and itsmetabolites that compete with estrogens to occupyestrogen receptors (Mikkola et al., 1995). Addition-ally, the genetic deletion of prostacyclin receptor 1,which is coupled to G aq/11, reduces systolic blood pressure only in men (Audoly et al., 1999). Prosta-glandin E production and activities, the cytochromeP450 metabolic pathway (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid), lypo-oxygenases, andlipoxins are influenced by sex (Pace et al., 2017; Mouatet al., 2018). The administration of low doses of aspirininduces a direct relationship between age and aspirin-triggered 15-epi-lipoxin A 4 in women but not in men(Pace et al., 2017). Furthermore, women absorb aspi- rin more rapidly, distribute it in larger apparent Vd, and hydrolyze it more rapidly than men (M\u00fcller andFromm, 2011; Soldin al., and glucuronic conjugation of aspirinis lower than in men (Ho et al., 1985). However, the useof OC in women elevates glycine and glucuronic acidconjugation and makes aspirin bioavailability similarto that of men (Spranger et al., 1989). Aspirin is effective in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in both sexes (Pace et al., 2017). However, thesituation is less clear in primary prevention: TheAmerican College of Cardiology and the AmericanHeart Association downgraded the recommendationfor aspirin. Some studies indicate that the antithrom-botic effects of aspirin are present only in men (Harris et al., 1977; Canadian Cooperative Study Group, 1978). However, the Women' sH e a l t hS t u d yr e v e a l e d that aspirin reduces the risk of total and ischemic strokes in women, whereas the risk of MI or deathfrom cardiovascular events were not reduced (Ridkeret al., 2005). A meta-analysis including six random-ized studies concluded that in primary prevention,aspirin provides men and women with a similar re-duction of cardiovascular events (Berger et al., 2006). However, these are not unequivocal results, and a second meta-analysis including the same six studiesconcluded that aspirin lowe rs major coronary events only in men (Baigent et al., 2009). Finally, resistancet oa s p i r i ni sh i g h e ri no l dw o m e n( A w i d ie ta l . ,2 0 1 1 ) .Mechanistically, emerging evidence suggest the exis-tence of agonist-dependent sex differences in platelet responses to aspirin. Despite higher cyclooxygenase 1 inhibition in women, daily aspirin exposure for 4 weeks resulted in a paradoxical attenuation of platelet in-hibition in response to epinephrine and ADP over timein women but not in men (Friede et al., 2020). Thesedata could explain at least in part the sexually di-morphic outcome observed with antiplatelet drugs forthe prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The mainadverse effect of aspirin is bleeding, and a Swedish study reported that aspirin-induced bleeding is lower in men than in women (Rydberg et al., 2014). In contrast,aspirin use is associated with a risk of hearing loss onlyin men (Curhan et al., 2010). Beyond aspirin, otherantiplatelet therapies are more efficient in males thanin females (Becker et al., 2006; Mehta et al., 2006;Qayyum et al., 2008; Capodanno and Angiolillo, 2010;Patti et al., 2014). 5. Nitric Oxide. Another important sex-divergent target is nitric oxide (NO) (Ahmed et al., 2019), which isgenerated in part through different NO synthases, someof which are regulated by sex hormones (Duckles andMiller, chemical reduction and ni 2018). In basal conditions and after nitrate supplementa- tion, females reduce oral nitrate to a greater extent, whichl e a d st oh i g h e rl e v e l so fn i t r i t e ,ap r e c u r s o ro fN O( K a p i l et al., 2018). 6. Influence of the Microbiome. As discussed above for PK, the efficacy of some drugs may be mediated via modulation of the GI microbiome. For example, oralantibiotics (Iizumi et al., 2016) are a class of drugs thatinadvertently disrupt the GI microbiome. Metforminwas shown to not only modulate the GI microbiome butlikely has efficacy in improving glucose regulation by GI microbiome modulation (Forslund et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2017; Vallianou et al., 2019). Additionally, PD of an oraldrug, which is at least partially dependent on drug-microbiome interactions, may be confounded by modu-lations of the gut microbiome because of diet (Davidet al., 2014), sex hormones (Markle et al., 2013; Orget al., 2016), and sex-by-diet interactions (Org et al.,2016). Although early studies suggest that the human GI microbiome is relatively stable and adult-like after the first 3 years of life (Yatsunenko et al., 2012), recentdata indicate that the GI microbiota community ofpreadolescent children is d ifferent than that of adults when compared taxonomically (Hollister et al., 2015),suggesting that changes may occur during puberty. GImicrobiota taxonomical shifts occur also during pregnancywith vast expansion of diversity from the first trimester to the third trimester (Koren et al., 2012). Moreover, stress during early pregnancy not only induces a shift inmaternal fecal bacteria community structure but alsodifferentially alters the GI m icrobiome of the offspring in a male-specific manner (Ja /C20sarevi /C19c et al., 2017). Further- more, castration of either adult male or female mice shiftstheir GI microbiome profiles (Harada et al., 2016). Thesedata suggest that sex hormon es influence the community of GI microbiota. The reverse is also documented. Transfero ff e c a lm i c r o b i o t af r o mm a t u r em a l em i c et of e m a l em i c eincreases serum testosterone levels in the recipientfemales (Markle et al., 2013), suggesting that microbiotamay function to regulate sex hormones, at least in rodents.Thus, gut microbiota influence sex differences in both PK and PD, and this needs more specific research in humans. 7. Heart Electrophysiology. There are important electrophysiological sex differences in the heart, in-cluding faster resting heart rates and longer QTintervals in women than in men (Regitz-Zagrosek andKararigas, 2017). These differences seem to be influ-enced at least in part by sex hormones. For example,endogenous testosterone upregulates both rapidly (I Kr) andslowly (IKs)activating delayed rectifier potassium channels leading to a short action potential. In contrast, endogenous estrogens downregulate I Krand I Ks, of Cav1.2 a(primary the L-type calcium-channel protein 1) and sodium-calcium ex-change protein 1 are higher at the base than at theapex of the epicardium only in women who are fertile(Papp et al., 2017). Such differences in ion channelexpression may explain why male sex is a risk factorfor either Brugada syndrome or Brugada drug- induced syndrome and su dden death (Konigstein et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2018), whereas being a female is a risk factor for long QT-interval syndrome (LQTS)(Regitz-Zagrosek et al., 2016). The Brugada syn-drome is induced by sodium -channel blocking drugs prescribed both for cardiac arrhythmias as well asfor non-cardiovascular drugs such as psychotropic and psychotropicdrugs. For example, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, whichare two antibiotics, exert sex-specific effects on the QTsubintervals probably related to the I Ksand I Krinhibi- tory properties of moxifloxacin versus inhibition of I Kr only of levofloxacin (Taubel et al., 2019). Together, theabove data indicate that the heart is a sex-specific toxicological target. This is also confirmed by tramadol adverse reaction, which induces tachycardia and S-waveabnormalities, especially in men, whereas LQTS andright bundle branch blocks prevail in women (AlizadehGhamsari et al., 2016). 8. Role of Genetic Polymorphism and Epigenetics. Sex differences in PD may be influenced by geneticpolymorphisms. For example, a variant of the ACE1 (I and D alleles) modifies the ACEI activity, with these drugs being more renoprotective in women with D/Dgenotype versus men with D/D genotype (Ruggenentiet al., 2008). This polymorphism also affects pharmaco-logical response of hydrochlorothiazide, with mean de-cline in blood pressure being greater in II than in DDhomozygotes among women. In contrast, in men, themean decline in blood pressure is greater in DD than in II homozygotes (Schwartz et al., 2002). Epigenetics modifications could play a role in the sexually dimorphic PD of drugs. First, DNA methyla- tion and differ between the twosexes (Ghahramani et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2015), andepigenetic changes can alter the regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters (Tracyet al., 2016); for example, hydralazine, a vasodilator, and procainamide, blocker, can triggera lupus-like autoimmune disease (Cornacchia et al.,1988). Taken together, the above data suggest that thesexually dimorphic epigenome may participate in sexdifferences in the PD and PK of drugs. IV. Sex-Specific Pharmacology of Drugs Acting in Different Physiologic Systems Sex differences in the therapeutic and adverse effects of drugs are described. Here we focus on acting on cardiovascular and metabolic diseases as well as pain.738 Mauvais-Jarvis et al.A. Cardiovascular Unfortunately, most cardiovascular studies do not report effects and adverse effects specified according to sex, which hampers meta-analysis that might lead to new insights. In this section, we report on sex and gender differences in the most prominent cardiovascu-lar drugs (summarized in Table 1). 1. Digoxin. In 1997, the Digitalis Investigation Group confirmed the efficiency of digoxin therapy for patientswith heart failure (Digitalis Investigation Group, 1997).Thereafter, guidelines strongly endorsed the use ofdigoxin in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) without considering sex. However, in a post hoc subgroup analysis, digoxin was associated withsignificantly higher mortality among women takingdigoxin compared with those taking placebo, an effectthat was not observed in men (Rathore et al., 2002).Subsequently, unfavorable survival effects reportedi nw o m e nw e r ea t t r i b u t e dt oh i g h e rd r u gs e r u ml e v e l sin the upper normal range. In the absence of defini- tive evidence, digoxin plas ma concentration should be below 0.8 ng/ml in women and men (Rathore et al., 2003). 2.bBlockers. bBlockers are cornerstones in the treatment of heart failure. Two major trials, theMERIT-HF (metoprolol CR/XL) study (MERIT-HF,1999) and the Carvedilol Prospective RandomizedCumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) trial (Packer et al., 1996), failed to find a beneficial effect on mortality in the small subgroups of women. In theCIBIS II study, women profited significantly fromtreatment with bisoprolol (CIBIS-II, 1999; Simon et al.,2001). Pooling of mortality results from MERIT-HF,CIBIS II, and COPERNICUS showed survival benefitsin both women and men (Ghali et al., 2002). The lack ofevidence in some large bblocker studies is therefore probably due to the underrepresentation of women inthese trials. Metoprolol and propranolol are primarily lized by liver cytochrome CYP2D6, which has a loweractivity in women than in men (Tanaka and Hisawa,1999; Labb\u00e9 et al., 2000). Propranolol reachesplasma levels that are up to 80% higher in womencompared with men. The optimal effect of the b blocker metoprolol may also be achieved with lowerdoses in women than in men: A 50-mg metoprololdose in adult women provided an approximatelysimilar drug exposure to a 100-mg dose in adult men(Eugene, 2016). Oral contraceptives can also interactwith metoprolol metaboli sm and further increase its plasma levels in women (Kendall et al., 1982). Arecent post hoc analysis in the BIOSTAT-CHF (Biology Study to Tailored Treatment in Chronic Heart Failure) study performed in 11 European countries suggestedthat women with HFrEF might require lower doses ofbblockers and ACEI than men for optimal effects (Santema et al., 2019). The results from the Europeanstudy were confirmed in an Asian cohort (Santemaet al., 2019). 3. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors. In early [e.g., CONSENSUS I, Sur- vival and Ventricular Enlargement and Studies of Left Ventricul ar Dysfunction (SOLVD)], ACEIs led to smaller mortality reductions in womencompared with men (Regitz-Zagrosek, 2006). Latertrials, including Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy(AIRE) and Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation(HOPE) as well as a number of smaller studies, showedsignificant benefits of ACE inhibition in women (Regitz- Zagrosek, 2006). However, the \"Second Australian National Blood Pressure Study \"(ACE inhibitors vs. diuretics) reported a significant reduction in cardiovas- cular events in men but not in women despite similarreductions in blood pressure in both sexes (Wing et al.,2003). Most recently, the Biostat HF trial suggestedthat women with HFrEF reach the same treatmenteffects (i.e., mortality and reduction of cardiovascular events) with lower doses than men and do not benefit from uptitrating to guideline-recommended doses(Santema et al., 2019). Thus, the underlying patho-physiology of cardiovascular disease may interferewith treatment results in a sex-specific manner.Adverse effects of ACEI, especially a typical drycough, that occur early wi th treatment and seem to be dose-independent are more frequent in women than in men (Mackay et al., 1999). 4. Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers. Major ARB studies in patients with hypertension after myocardial infarction and heart failu re found no sex-specific differences and showed the same safety profile inboth sexes. This was true for Losartan Interventionfor Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension, Evaluationof Losartan In (Irbesartan in Heart Failure), and Can-desartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reductionin Mortality and Morbidity (Seeland and Regitz-Zagrosek, 2012). 5. Sacubitril-Valsartan. Recently, completely un- suspected sex differences were found in a large RCTcomparing the combined Neprilysin inhibitor/ARB(sacubitril-valsartan) and valsartan in patients withheart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)(McMurray et al., 2019a; et al., 2019). with increased generation of cGMP, a signaling molecule that is reduced in HFpEF and is beneficial in HFrEF (McMurray et al., 2014a,b). Sacubitril-valsartandid not result in a significantly lower rate of totalhospitalizations for heart failure and death from car-diovascular causes in a mixed-sex cohort of patients Sex-Based Pharmacology 739with HFpEF/HFrEF (Solomon et al., 2019). However, it led to a significant reduction in event rate versusvalsartan in women, which was not observed in men(0.73 in women and 1.03 in men; P interaction = 0.017) (McMurray et al., 2019a). Unfortunately, the study could not provide a definite mechanistic basis for this finding. 6. Renin Inhibitors. Aliskiren, the f irst nonpeptide active renin inhibitor, provided equally effective, dose-dependent blood pressure lowering in women and menwith mild-to-moderate hypertension and also in theelderly, obese, or those with m etabolic syndrome (Gradman et al., 2010). 7. Aldosterone Receptor Antagonists. The Random- ized Aldactone Evaluation Study found no difference inthe effect of spironolactone on symptomatic heartfailure between men and women (Pitt et al., 1999).However, women represented only 30% of the enrolledpatients, and the trial was not powered to detect sexdifferences. The major clinical trial of eplerenonein patients with acute MI and left ventricular dysfunc- tion, Eplerenone Post-AMI Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) showed a trend towardgreater benefit for women treated with eplerenone at 30days, which was not confirmed at 16 months (Pitt et al.,2003). Furthermore, in an exploratory, post hoc, non-prespecified analysis of the TOPCAT (AldosteroneAntagonist Therapy for Adults With Heart Failureand Preserved Systolic Function) trial, evidence for sex differences was found. In TOPCAT, subjects with symptomatic HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction$45% were randomized to spironolactone or placebo. In a post hoc subgroup analysis in which only subjectsenrolled from the Americas were analyzed, spirono-lactone therapy was associated with reduced all-cause mortality in women( h a z a r dr a t i o :0 . 6 6 ; P= 0.01) but not in men (p interaction = 0.02) (Merrill et al., 2019). Thus, even though the interaction between spironolactone and sex in TOPCAT overalland in the present analysis was not significant for theprimary cardiovascular outcome, there was a reduc-tion in all-cause mortality associated with spirono-lactone therapy in women, with a significantinteraction between sex and treatment arm. Moreprospective studies are nee ded for confirmation and mechanistic understanding. 8. Antiarrhythmic Drugs. A number of antiarrhyth- mic drugs prolong cardiac repolarization. As discussedin the PD section, women have longer rate-corrected QTintervals than men and are more prone to adverseeffects with such drugs. Women consistently exhibiteda higher incidence of QT prolongation and torsades depointes The major hyperten- sion trials with calcium antagonists revealed no evidencefor sex differences in outcomes (Seeland and Regitz-Zagrosek, 2012). Only the Amlodipine CardiovascularCommunity Trail trial therapy with amlodipine resultedin more pronounced blood pressure reduction in women than in men. Women also had a higher incidence of edema. The sex differences were small, and furtherevidence is needed to support clinical relevance. No sexdifferences of verapamil treatment were confirmed. 10. Sex-Specific Reporting of Effects and Adverse Effects. Knowledge on sex differences in effects and adverse effects in RCTs is crucial to understand themechanisms of drug action in women and men and to optimize therapy. However, most RCTs do not present their results in a sex-disaggregated manner. A recentRCT reporting positive effects of colchicine for MIincluded only 20% women and did not segregate theresults by sex (Tardif et al., 2019). In a recent systematicsearch of PubMed and EMBASE to collect all availableinformation on ADRs to ACE inhibitors, b-blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid re- ceptor antagonists, ivabradine, and digoxin in both women and men with HF identifying 155 eligiblerecords, only 11 (7%) reported ADR data for womenand men separately (Bots et al., 2019). Three of the 11studies reported a higher risk of ACE inhibitor -related ADRs in women, and one study showed higher digoxin-related mortality risk for women. These results un-derline the scarcity of ADR data stratified by sex. The study investigators called for a more comprehensive reporting of ADR data for women and men separately(Bots et al., 2019). B. Pain and Analgesia Chronic pain, defined as pain lasting over 3 months in duration, is one of the most commonly reported health problems in the United States (Elzahaf et al., 2012; Kennedy et al., 2014). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that over 20% of US adultsexperienced chronic pain in 2016, with 8% experiencinghigh-impact chronic pain (Nahin, 2015). These statisticsare much worse for the elderly population, in which anestimated 45% -80% of persons aged 65 or older suffer from chronic pain on a daily basis. Despite beingintroduced over 5 millennia ago, opioids remain the most common therapeutic treatment of the manage- ment of chronic pain (Brookoff, 2000a,b), and it isestimated that as many as 3% -5% of adults in the United States are prescribed long-term opioid therapy(Boudreau et al., 2009). Among pain sufferers, womenare more likely than men to be prescribed opioids athigher doses and for longer periods of time (Campbellet al., 2010; Frenk et al., 2015; Manubay et al., 2015). This may have potentially important implications for the development of tolerance and addiction to opioids.Indeed, although men are more likely to die from drugoverdose than women, between 1999 and 2010, over-dose deaths due to opioid pain relievers increased by740 Mauvais-Jarvis et al.415% in women compared with 265% in men [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013]. It is becoming increasingly clear that opioids may not offer the same degree of pain relief in women than in men, with research over the last 3 decades implicating sex as a biologic variable influencing opioid modulationof pain. The majority of this research comes frompreclinical studies on rodents. Indeed, despite thesignificantly higher prevalence of pain reports anddisorders in women, very few clinical studies includesex as an independent variable. Among studies thatinclude sex as a factor, the majority demonstrate decreased analgesic efficacy of opioids in women (Berkley, 1997; Cepeda and 2005; Mogil and Bailey, 2010). Notably, one clinicalstudy reported that females required 30% more mor-phine to reach the same level of analgesia as males(Cepeda and Carr, 2003). In contrast, other studiesreport that the analgesic efficacy of opioids was compa- rable between the sexes (Bijur et al., 2005; Glasson 2002; 2000). Sexdifferences in morphine consumption (i.e., patient-controlled analgesia) have also been reported. However,as women consistently experience a greater preponder-ance of the negative side effects associated with acuteopioid consumption, including nausea, dysphoria, head-ache, and vomiting (Myles et al., 1997; Cepeda et al., 2003; Fillingim et al., 2005; Comer et al., 2010), opioid consumption is not a reliable indicator of morphineanalgesia (Myles et al., 1997; Cepeda et al., 2003;Fillingim et al., 2005; Comer et al., 2010). A recentmeta-analysis with moderate quality of evidencereported that in acute pain, the analgesic response toopioid does not diverge between men and women.However, when women self-administer the drug, they take a lower daily amount of opioids. When chronic pain is investigated, the quality of studies decreases, and innoncancer pain, women receive lower daily doses ofopioid, whereas the daily dose of opioids for cancer paindoes not diverge among women and men. The aboveresults were strongly influenced by age, comorbidmental disorders, type of administration, type ofopioids, type of patients, and body weight. However, these factors are not considered in the prescription of opioids, and this may explain the variability in clinicaltrial results (Pisanu et al., 2019). Studies in rodents examining the impact of sex on opioid modulation of acute or persistent pain haveconsistently reported that morphine is more efficaciousin males than in females (Kepler et al., 1989; Boyeret al., 1998; Craft et al., Cicero et 2002; Krzanowska et al., 2002; Holtman et al., 2003; Ji 2006; Loyd 2006; Wang et al.,2006; Loyd 2008; Posillico et 2015). Sexdifferences in morphine action Wang 2006; Bernalet al., 2007; Loyd et al., 2008; Doyle et al., 2017; Doyleand Murphy, 2018) and visceral pain (Ji et al., 2006, 2007, 2008; Murphy et al., 2009; Larauche et al., 2012), the ED 50is approximately 2-fold higher for females than for males. Sex differences in opioid analgesia arenot limited to morphine. Greater pain relief is alsoobserved in male rats for almost every opioid tested(Barrett et 2002; Terner Peckham and Traynor, 2006; Bai et al., 2015).Several factors have been shown to contribute to the sex differences in the ability of morphine to attenuate persistent and/or severe pain, including sex differencesin the neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, and neuro-immunological aspects of central nervous system cir-cuits subserving pain and analgesia. Sex differences inm-opioid receptor expression and signaling (Bernalet al., 2007; Loyd et al., 2008) as well as spinalm-opioid receptor and k-opioid receptor dimerization (Chakrabarti et al., 2010) have all been shown tocontribute to the sexually dimorphic effects of mor-phine. In addition to neural mechanisms, sex-specificdifferences in glial signaling have also been implicated(Sorge et al., Doyle et al., 2017; Doyle andMurphy, 2017, 2018; Averitt et al., 2019). The fact thatso many seemingly competitive theories exist to accountfor the dimorphic response to morphine implies a paral- lel and/or upstream mediator of these effects. The necessity of sex-specific research on pain and pain management is clear. Unfortunately, despite growing literature reporting sex differences in painand morphine analgesia, the overwhelming majorityof preclinical studies of pain (approximately 79%) arestill conducted exclusively in males (Mogil, 2012). Atthis point, it is clear that sex differences in opioid modulation of pain exist and warrant additional, com- prehensive investigation into the underlying mecha-nisms. Building on what is currently known regardingsex differences in pain and analgesia will likely identifyadditional targets for the development of novel paintherapeutics; only then will we be able to advanceeffective pain management in both women and men. C. Body Weight and Blood Glucose From a global view, there are more men living with diabetes but more women who are obese with expected further increase of the combination of obesity anddiabetes (diabesity) in the near future (InternationalDiabetes Federation, 2019; https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight). Over-all women who are diabetic bear a greater excess risk of cardiovascular disease and of excess mortality com- pared with men (Labib, 2003; Kautzky-Willer et al.,2016; Ostan et al., 2016; Kautzky-Willer Harreiter,2017). On the other hand, women more often show\"metabolically healthy obesity, \"which may in part beSex-Based Pharmacology 741ascribed to more favorable fat distribution and sex hormones (Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2013; Kautzky-Willer et al., 2016). The cause of increased vascularrisk in women with diabesity is not entirely known, but both sex and gender differences in treatment modali- ties, clinical inertia, adherence to drug therapy, andmetabolism of drugs (sex-specific cytochrome expres-sion) as well as cultural and lifestyle factors must beconsidered (Rossi et al., 2013; Ostan et al., 2016). Thereis evidence that women reach therapeutic goals forcardiometabolic health less often than men (Kr\u00e4meret al., 2012; Franzini et al., 2013). Women who are diabetic show worse risk control and are less likely to be on target for HbA1c despite comparable antihypergly-cemic treatment (Penno et al., 2013). Therefore, poten-tial sex differences in intensity of pharmacologicalmanagement or quality of care may be ascribed todifferent pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic factors,drug efficacy, or side effects as well as differences incommunication and patient or physician attitudes. 1. Antiobesity Drugs. Most studies show greater weight loss in men compared with women in responseto diet, exercise, or combined lifestyle interventions aswell as after bariatric surgery (Harreiter and Kautzky-Willer, 2018; Cataldi et al., 2019). However, conflictingresults exist in regard to pharmacological therapy, withmany more women taking antiobesity drugs psychosocial problems and stig- matization. Most antiobesity drugs act via central mechanisms by suppressing food intake or increasingenergy expenditure. The serotonergic drugs fenflur-amine and dexfenfluramine were withdrawn from themarket because of palpitations, insomnia, heart valvedisease, and incident pulmonal hypertension, whichwere mainly reported in women (Kautzky-Willer andLemmens-Gruber, 2012). In parallel, the antiobesity drugs adrenergic drug) and rimonabant (selective cannabinoid-1 receptorblocker), which also targeted the central control ofappetite and body weight, were withdrawn from themarket based on serious adverse cardiovascular eventsor psychiatric side effects and safety concerns, includingcases of death and suicide, especially in women(Kautzky-Willer and Lemmens-Gruber, 2012). Data on sex differences in regard to orlistat, a pan- creatic and gastric lipase inhibitor that is commonlyused in Europe and United States as a prescribed orover-the-counter medication, are scarce and in partcontroversial (Kautzky-Willer and Lemmens-Gruber,2012; Cataldi et al., 2019) (Table 2). Otherwise, thisdrug is well studied and appears to have low rates oflong-term side effects. It can cause oily stools and gastrointestinal problems by reduction of fat absorp- tion, thereby reducing energy intake, and may furtherlead to deficiency in fat-soluble vitamins (Bessesen andVan Gaal, 2018). The probability of losing more than5% body weight is modest compared with the otherweight-loss drugs (Bessesen and Van Gaal, 2018).Studies in patients who were orlistat-treated showedgreater weight loss in men but better improvement ofmetabolic parameters in women (Tchoukhine et al., 2011) as well as a decrease in androgen levels and improved ovulation rates in women with polycysticovary syndrome independent of changes in body massindex (Diamanti-Kandarakis et al., 2007; Kautzky-Willer and Lemmens-Gruber, 2012). In addition, orli-stat was shown to be more bene ficial for women for weight maintenance (Robertson et a l., 2016). Orlistat was the most commonly prescribed weight-management drug in the MOVE! Study, with female sex being related both to higher use of antiobesity dr ugs in general and higher use of orlistat in particular (Thomas et al., 2019). Postmarket-ing analysis revealed that u se of weight-loss drugs and orlistat is higher in women and patients who are diabetic,but sex did not affect long-term adherence, which was ingeneral poor and much lower than in clinical trials(Hemo et al., 2011). A large number of (in most cases serious) adverse events reported for antiobesity drugs, including orlistat, were assessed in the Eudra VigilanceDatabase from 2007 to 2014, which reported 159 deathsand a majority of adverse events occurring in women(Aagaard et al., 2016). The GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist liraglutide was originally approved for the therapy of type 2 diabetes.The effects of GLP-1 analogs (GLP-1As) are com- plex, acting at different central and peripheral levels affecting glucose and energy homeostasis and glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Because liraglutide in-duced a marked weight loss in patients who were obeseand diabetics, it was subsequently investigated in RCTsin patients who were nondiabetic with obesity andfinally approved as an antiobesity drug at a higher dose(3 mg vs. 1.8 mg/day). Preregistration trials indicated that women show greater weight loss in response to liraglutide independent of the dosage up to 3 mg(Wilding et al., 2016). Exposure-response analysis fromRCTs further revealed that weight loss increased inparallel with drug exposure; in women, effects ofliraglutide appeared to level off at the highest dose of3 mg, but men did not reach a plateau at this dose(Wilding et al., 2016). Sex differences in pharmacoki- netics leading to greater disposition of liraglutide in females could be responsible for about 50% of thegreater weight loss in women compared with men underthe dose of 3 mg liraglutide (Wilding et al., 2016).Weight-adjusted exposure was increased by about30% in women in comparison with men in the pre-registration trials, and the effect of sex was independentof the effect of body weight (Overgaard et al., 2016). The exact underlying causes for the decreased clearance of liraglutide in women compared with weight-matchedmen (other than different body composition) are notclear. However, sex steroids appear to impact liraglu-tide pharmacodynamics.

In human by amplifying the incretin effect of GLP-1 (Navarro et a l., 2016). GLP-1 regulates feeding behavior at the level of the central nervous system by stimulating anorexigenic proopiomelanocor-tin neurons and attenuating orexigenic et al., 2014). Estrogens modulate GLP-1 effects on feeding behavior and the reward system and its anorexigenicactivity in key nodes of the central reward circuitry(Cataldi et al., 2019). In addition, GLP-1 analogs canstimulate gastric vagal afferents and consequently slowgastric emptying and promote satiety in brain regions.Women exhibit slower gastric emptying in general, butpossible clinically relevant sex differences in gastric emptying by use of GLP-1A are unclear at present. Despite all of the sex differences described above,differential dosing based on sex or body weight hasnot been instituted, and the highest tested dose of 3 mgis currently recommended for women and men based onthe Lorcaserin, a 5HT2c receptor agonist, stimulates serotonin anorectic effects at multiple levels. There are conflicting data in regard to sex differences in response to lorcaserin (Cat aldi et al., 2019). Estradiol is known to modulate serotoninergic neurotransmis-sion, thereby enhancing the anorectic effects of sero-toninergic drugs. It was also postulated that estradiolcould enhance the expression of 5HT2c receptors inthe hindbrain or that estradiol and serotonincould interact at postreceptor levels. A converging signaling pathway in regulation of energy homeosta- sis between serotonin 5HT2c receptors and estrogensappears plausible. Naltrexone/bupropion combination was shown to pro- mote greater weight loss in women in preregistrationtrials (US Food and Drug Administration; Center forDrug Evaluation and Research, 2014). This combina-tion exerts central anorectic effects by blocking trans- porters for dopamine and noradrenaline as well as m-opiod receptors and the b-endorphin autofeedback on POMC neurons (Cataldi et al., 2019). Thus, reuptakeof dopamine and noradrenalin is inhibited. Naltrexonecounteracts the opioid-dependent feedback mechanismpotentiating the anorectic effects of the antidepressive effects thiscombination (Dhir Kulkarni, 2008). There is evi- dence for sexually dimorphic effects of naltrexone on the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,with higher increase of cortisol levels in women andestrogen interactions. Therefore, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis of women appears to be moresensitive to opioid antagonism (Roche et al., 2010). Inaddition, it was shown that hormonal and subjectiveeffects to naltrexone differed across the menstrual cycle(Roche and King, 2015). Greater increase of cortisol and prolactin as well as more pronounced adverse effects were described after acute n altrexone administration in women during the luteal phase compared with theearly follicular phase and in women compared withmen. These findings could have clinical implicationsfor naltrexone treatment in women. In a mouse model,the antiobesity combinatio n of naltrexone and drinking via hypotha- lamic POMC/melanocortin 4 receptor -dependent mechanisms in males but was ineffective in females (Zhou et al., 2019). With phentermin/topiramate, these weight-loss drugs were combined to achieve a prolonged clinicaleffect. Larger effects on relative weight reduction werereported for women compared with men (Cataldi et al.,2019). The effects of topiramate, which is approved for epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis, are complex, multi- level, and not fully understood (Cataldi et al., 2019).Main mechanisms appear to be related to potentiationof insulin and leptin actions mainly in the hypothala-mus as well as an increase in anorectic neuropeptidesincluding POMC and thyrotropin-releasing hormone(Caricilli further con-trol the a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl -4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor expression, which is inhibited by topiramate,sex hormones could be responsible for possible sex differ-ences in topiramate efficacy (Cataldi et al., 2019).Phentermine, a substituted enhancesadrenergic dopaminergic neurotransmission, whichalso appears to be estrogen-dependent. Overall, sex-specific effects of weight-loss drugs are described. Sexand gender differences regarding PK and PD of these drugs are described in more detail in a recent review (Cataldi et al., 2019). 2. Antihyperglycemic Drugs. Gender-dimorphic effects of antidiabetic therapies have been described. Ina German multicenter observational study, womenexperienced greater weight loss after treatment withlifestyle, metformin, or sulfonylurea, whereas menshowed higher HbA1c reductions after therapy with lifestyle and metformin only (Sch\u00fctt et al., 2015). Diabetic males also achieved better glycemic controlunder drug therapy than females in a systematicreview (Mannucci et al., 2014). In addition, a retrospec-tive cohort study showed that female sex predictedearlier secondary failure after metformin monotherapy(Mamza et al., 2016). Some studies reported associa-tions between antihyperglycemic drug treatment and various cancers (Table 2). Overall, insulin-sparing drugs appear to relate to lower cancer risk than insulin-providing drugs, with some sexually dimorphic effects(Kautzky-Willer et al., 201 7), although data are still conflicting. A 9-fold increased risk for colon, liver, and744 Mauvais-Jarvis et al.lung cancer together with a decreased risk for prostate cancer was found in men under insulin or sulfonylureatherapy (Kautzky-Willer et al., 2017). In women, glitazonestreatment was associated with lower risk of skin and colon cancer, and metformin treatment was associated with lower risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in an Austriandiabetic population. In both men and women, insulin andsulfonylureas were associated with higher risk of pancreasand brain cancers. In the analysis of 15 years of postrandomization follow-up of the diabetes prevention trial, the incidenceof diabetes under initial metformin therapy was re- duced by 36%, with a trend of greater risk reduction in males than females in subgroup analysis; however,among women, metformin 's effect was significantly greater for women with a history of prior gestationaldiabetes mellitus compared with women who wereparous prediabetic without gestational diabetes melli-tus (Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group,2019). The diabetes prevention trial also reported no coronary artery calcium differences between lifestyle and placebo intervention groups in either sex, but itshowed lower coronary artery calcium severity andpresence among men in the metformin versus theplacebo group, even after adjustment for age, statinuse, and other confounders (Goldberg et al., 2017). Onthe contrary, no metformin effect was seen in women. For incretin-based therapies, a gender-imbalanced prescription practice was reported with more frequentprescription of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibi-tors to males, particularly patients who were older withcomorbidities, but more frequent prescription of GLP-1analogs to young obese females (Zhang et al., 2010;Hirsch et al., 2011). This gender-specific channelingmay be ascribed to weight-loss effects of GLP-1As inlight of greater stigmatization of obesity in women and low risk of clinical side effects of DPP-4 inhibitors. Studying the effectiveness and tolerability of the GLP-1A exenatide in subgroups showed that women experi-enced greater reduction of weight and fasting glucoseand blood pressure levels but more severe gastrointes-tinal side effects (Pencek et al., 2012). However, ina real-world study, after 1 year of exenatide therapy,glycemic response prevailed in men, whereas weight loss was higher in women without significant gender differences observed in gastrointestinal side effects(Anichini et al., 2013). Based on recent cardiovascularoutcome trials (CVOTs) of new antihyperglycemicdrugs, beneficial cardiorenal effects were shown forthe class of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)inhibitors as well as for GLP-1A (Figs. 1 and 2; Table 2).In all trials, there was a preponderance of males, with participation by women ranging from 23% to 38% in the SGLT2 CVOTs and from Holman Neal Gerstein et al., 2019; McMurrayet al., 2019b; Wiviott et al., 2019). Subgroup analysisshowed a significant reduction of cardiovascular riskand thus a greater benefit in men than in women,although a trend for lower risk was also shown for women, and no sex interaction was reported in some studies. This may be attributed to lower cardiovascularevent rates in females in general, as evidenced in boththe placebo and active compound groups of womencompared with male counterparts. Therefore, longerstudy duration in female subgroups to allow reachingsignificant primary outcome events is warranted. Toconfirm beneficial effects in women, we performed a meta-analysis of MACE as a primary endpoint of CVOTs for both drug classes, and this could showsignificant risk reduction in both sexes (Figs. 1 and 2). Analysis of fracture rates under antihyperglycemic medication is necessary because diabetes, per se, isrelated to alterations of bone quality and increasedfracture risk in both sexes, with particular high risk inwomen who are postmenopausal. Regarding specific classes, data are controversial, but overall, metformin and GLP-1A related to lower fracture risk, whereasinsulin and sulfonylurea therapy was associated withhigher risk in some studies (Gilbert et al., 2016; Napoliet al., 2017; Smieszek et al., 2018). There is evidencethat glitazones are associated with higher rates offractures in women who are postmenopausal and thatonly canagliflozin among the SGLT2 inhibitors relates to decreased bone mineral density and increased frac- ture risk in some analysis (Habib et al., 2010; Mannucciand Monami, 2017). For SGLT2 inhibitors, higher infections, vulvovaginitis, and balanitis with higherincidence of urogenital infections among women weredocumented (Johnsson et al., 2013). In addition, highernumbers of severe adverse events, such as ketoacidosis, were reported for women than for men (Fadini et al., 2017). Moreover, case series of Fournier gangrene weredocumented in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitorswith clear predominance of men (Bersoff-Matchaet al., 2019). The event rate was much higher than thatdocumented for other antihyperglycemic classes in thepast (55 events in 6 years vs. 19 events in a 35-yeartimeframe). Women more often experience severe hypoglycemia when using insulin compared with men. Therapyinitiation or titration with higher insulin doses inrelation to body weight of women could be one reasonfor this finding. Nevertheless, women reach glycemictargets less often than men (Kautzky-Willer et al., 2012;McGill et al., 2013). Furthermore, higher levels ofstress, anxiety or uncertainty, and greater impact of psychologic distress could contribute to the higher risk of hypoglycemia in women, which consequently alsorelates to increased risk of falls and fractures andpossibly cardiovascular problems (Trento et al., 2015;Kautzky-Willer and Pharmacology 745During pregnancy and in the preconception period of women with chronic hyperglycemia, insulin is still the gold-standard therapy, as both metformin and glybur-ide pass the placenta and are associated with worseoutcome in the offspring. However, given the steadyincrease in the use of oral antidiabetic medications in women of reproductive age, better knowledge of their effects on neonatal and long-term outcomes of theoffspring as well as addressing barriers and needs ofwomen who are pregnant and diabetic for inclusion inclinical trials are needed for improvement of clinicalmanagement in the future (Kautzky-Willer and Har-reiter, 2018; Rubin, 2018). D. Lipids Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in both women and men in most developed countries and accounts for a larger proportion of deathsin women (51%) than in men (42%) in Europeanpopulations (Maas and Appelman, 2010). There aresex differences in risk factors and pathology of CAD, andwomen typically develop disease 10 years later than men, which has been attributed to the protective effects of ovarian hormones that dissipate after menopause(Garcia et al., 2016). In both sexes, elevated circulatinglipid levels, particularly cholesterol carried in low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)-C, is a well established riskfactor for CAD (Stone and Grundy, 2019). Severalfactors interact with sex to contribute to the develop-ment of dyslipidemia, including lipid-rich diet, seden-tary lifestyle, and genetic variation in genes thatinfluence lipid metabolism (Link and Reue, 2017). There is wide availability of drugs that effectively lower LDL-C levels and decrease the risk of coronaryevents, including statins, proprotein convertase sub-tilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, and ezetimibe(Last et al., 2017). These drugs act on distinct targets toinfluence LDL-C. Statins, which are among the mostwidely prescribed drugs of all types in the Westernworld, inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterolbiosynthesis, This both reduces endogenous cholesterol synthe- sis and increases LDL uptake from the circulationthrough feedback regulation of LDL receptor produc-tion. PCSK9 inhibitors are injectable monoclonal anti-bodies that LDL receptors bythe PCSK9 proprotein convertase, thereby increasingLDL uptake from the circulation. Ezetimibe partiallyblocks dietary cholesterol absorption by targeting an intestinal receptor for cholesterol uptake: Niemann- Pick C1-like protein 1. All of these drugs are generallymost effective at lowering LDL-C levels in combinationwith lifestyle modifications, such as reducing dietary fatand increasing physical activity.

Although cholesterol-lowering drugs are beneficial to both women and men, there are sexual inequities in theprevalence of use and adverse effects of these drugs.Numerous, large-scale studies indicate that statins andPCSK9 inhibitors also effectively prevent secondarycoronary events in both sexes (Baigent et al., 2010;Kostis et al., 2012; Stein and Raal, 2014; Fulcher et al.,2015; Collins et al., 2016). However, the proportion of individuals that receive and persistently use these drugs to reduce disease risk is lower in women than inmen (Chen et al., 2014; Victor et al., 2014). There appearto be several reasons for this. First, women are un-derrepresented in clinical trials for cholesterol-loweringdrugs, which is due in part to later age of onset fordyslipidemia (Manteuffel et al., 2014). In addition,women are less likely to be evaluated by a cardiologist and more likely to experience adverse effects of statins, as discussed further below (Zhang et al., 2016). Female sex is now recognized as a risk factor for the two most common statin adverse effects: myopathy andnew-onset 2016; Rosenson et al., 2017).Myopathy (muscle pain, weakness, and stiffness) occursin an estimated 10% -15% of statin users (Thompson et al., 2003; Mohassel and Mammen, 2013), and femalesex increases the odds of myopathy by 2-fold (Nguyenet al., 2018). An additional statin adverse effect is thedevelopment of new-onset diabetes. An increased occur-rence of new-onset diabetes (9%) during 4 years afterstatin use has been reported in a meta-analysis of13 placebo-controlled statin trials, but this varied by study (Sattar et al., 2010). A subsequent analysis of several of these same studies plus additional studiesrevealed a positive correlation between the proportionof women in the trial groups and the risk of statin-related incident diabetes. This assessment of 14 statintrials demonstrated a positive correlation betweenfemale sex and statin-related incident diabetes ( r= 0.6,P= 0.036) (Goodarzi et al., 2013). In this meta- analysis, a study consisting exclusively of men [West ofScotland Coronary Prevention Study (WYSCOPS)] hadthe lowest incidence of new-onset diabetes, whereasa study consisting exclusively of women (Women 's Health Initiative) had the highest incidence; studiesthat included both sexes had intermediate levels ofincident diabetes that correlated with the proportion ofwomen. Additionally, stratification of subjects within individual trials revealed important sex effects. For example, in the Justification for the Use of Statins inPrevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvas-tatin study, the incidence of new-onset diabetes was25%. However, stratification by sex showed that the riskof incident diabetes was increased by 49% in women,whereas it was increased by only 14% in men (Moraet al., 2010; Goodarzi et al., 2013). Furthermore, data from 150,000 participants in the Women 's Health Initiative indicated that women who are postmeno- pausal might be particularly vulnerable to developingdiabetes after statin use, with a reported 48% increasein risk of new-onset diabetes (Culver et al., 2012).

CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; seTE, TE.Sex-Based Pharmacology747The mechanisms underlying the increased suscepti- bility of females to statin adverse effects have not been delineated but likely include sex differences in physiol-ogy and PK. Statin adverse effects are thought to be associated with elevated blood concentrations of the drug, allowing increased exposure of tissues, such asmuscle to drug, leading to potential alterations inmitochondrial function and calcium signaling pathways(Ward et al., 2019). Since statin drugs are prescribed atunisex doses, the blood and tissue levels of statins insmaller individuals may be higher than in largerindividuals such that on average women may experi- ence higher concentrations. Sex differences in drug- metabolizing are typically higher in women compared withmen and could lead to differential amounts of bioactive statin in the two sexes (Waxman and Holloway, 2009). The concomitant use of other drugs that are metabo-lized by CYP3A4 (approximately half of widely useddrugs) can alter statin catabolism and lead to elevatedplasma levels. Sex differences in the levels of additionalenzymes that participate in the conversion of statinprodrugs to their active forms, their uptake into hepa-tocytes and other cell types, and their degradation and elimination may differ between males and females and should be carefully examined to better define sexdifferences in statin adverse effects (Thompson et 2017), and their beneficial effects have re-cently been linked with epigenetic changes of the longnoncoding RNA MANTIS (Leisegang et al., 2019). Therefore, epigenetic mechanisms, including altera- tions in microRNAs, could participate to the mecha-nisms responsible for statin-induced diabetes (Pasebanet al., 2019). Statin drug use for the prevention of CAD will likely increase under recent recommendations from TheAmerican College of Cardiology/American Heart Asso-ciation (Stone et al., 2014). Statins may also be prom- ising treatments for conditions such as osteoporosis, fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and Rettsyndrome (Buchovecky et al., 2013; \u00c7aku et al., 2014;An et al., 2017; Chung et al., 2018). However, whetherstatin therapy impacts the risk of osteoporosis isstill debated, and more studies are required toclarify potential effects of statins on bone health. Adose-dependent relationship between statins and the diagnosis of osteoporosis was found in the general Austrian population; although low-dose statin treat-ment was related to an underrepresentation of di-agnosed osteoporosis when compared with patientswho were nonstatin-treated, an overrepresentationof diagnosed osteoporosis was found in those onhigher statin dosages. Overall, the impact wasgreater in women, particularly in younger women(Leutner et al., 2019). Notably, cholesterol is a pre- cursor of steroid hormones, and thus, statins could also lower gonadal hormone levels. In summary, it is critical to optimize statin treatment of members of both sexes through greater inclusion offemales in clinical trials and in basic research of themechanisms that underlie adverse drug effects. E. Kidney 1. Kidney Function and Gender Bias of Glomerular Filtration Rate Equations. Men, in general, have larger and wider kidneys compared with women (Mileti /C19ce ta l . , 1998), and women have higher renovascular resistance, lower renal plasma flow, and lower absolute GFR com-pared with men (Munger and Baylis, 1988). Thus, GFRsare in the range of 15% -25% slower in women (Neugarten et al., 2002; Schwartz, 2007). Because measuring GFR is laborious and expensive, in the clinic we often estimate GFR through equations that use sex, serum creatininelevels, and sometimes body w eight. These equations have been shown to underestimate kidney function in womento a larger extent than in men (Inker et al., 2017). Inhumans, body surface area is the main predictor ofk i d n e ys i z e .T h e r e f o r e ,g i v e nt h a tm e nt e n dt oh a v elarger kidneys than women, the standardization of estimated GFR by a constant body surface area of 1.73 m 2,a sw ed oc u r r e n t l yw i t he s t i m a t e dG F R equations in clinical practice, may introduce genderbias (Carrero et al., 2018). Underestimation of kidney function in women possibly l eads to infratherapeutic dosages and low efficacy for drugs that require strictdose adjustment, such as the direct oral anticoagu-lants (that is, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) (Andrade et al., 2018). 2. Drug-Induced Nephrotoxicity. Medications are a relatively common cause of acute kidney injury, a sudden decline in kidney function. Up to 25% ofhospitalizations for acute kidney injury are attrib- uted nephro toxicity (Uchino et al., 2005). Drug-induced nephrotoxicity is more commonin patients who were hospitalized, particularly patients in the intensive care unit (Hoste et al., 2015). There is evidence to suggest that drug-induced nephrotoxicitymay be in some cases sex-related, but this is an areathat is largely unexplored. For instance, women havebeen reported to be more susceptible to nephrotoxicityfrom gentamicin (Moore et al., 1984) or renin-angiotensinsystem inhibitors ACEi/ARB (Mansfield et al., 2016),b u tm e nm a yb em o r ep r o n et od e v e l o pc i s p l a t i n (Nematbakhsh et al., 2013) or tobramycin (Goodrich and Hottendorf, 1995) nephrotoxicity compared withwomen. Finally, ACEi/ARB are common drugs for the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, myocardial748 Mauvais-Jarvis et al.infarction, and kidney disease. -mediated al., 2013), some patients mayexperience a sudden decline in kidney function after starting on these medications. Such sudden decline in kidney function has been associated with worseclinical outcomes and appears to be more commonamong women (Schmidt et al., 2017b; Sinnott et al.,2 0 1 7 ;F ue ta l . ,2 0 1 9 ) .W h yw o m e na r em o r ep r o n et othis is not well known but may be attributed to drugoverdosing; although ACEi/ARB recommended dos-ages are sex-neutral, experimental studies show an interaction between estrogens and the renal expression and activity of components of the renin-angiotensinsystem (Sandberg and Ji, 2003; Liu et al., 2010).Recent studies indicate that women may need lowerdosages than men to achieve the same therapeuticeffect (Santema et al., 2019) . Unfortunately, many of these complications prob ably remain undetected, given that less than 20% of new users of ACEi/ARB in routine care undergo the guideline-recommended monitoring for serum creatinine during the initialweeks of therapy (Schmidt et al., 2017a; Nilssonet al., 2018). F. Immunity and Vaccines Biologic sex has its most profound impact on the development of innate and adaptive immune responses after vaccination. Most inactivated viral vaccines in- duce predominantly humoral immunity, but viral vac-cines that use adjuvants or live attenuated viruses canalso induce innate and cellular immunity as well.Among adults (18+ years), females often develop anti-body responses that are about two times greater thanthe those of males after receiving vaccines that protectagainst influenza, hepatitis B, herpes, yellow fever, and smallpox viruses (Flanagan et al., 2017). The live attenuated yellow fever (YF17D) vaccine also inducesgreater expression of toll-like receptor signaling andinterferon-associated genes (i.e., innate immune signal-ing) in vaccinated females compared with males (Kleinet al., 2010). Because of mutations in seasonal, circu-lating influenza viruses, vaccination is recommendedannually; thus, there is considerably more data about sex differences in vaccine-induced immunity for vac- cines against influenza than other pathogens. In youngadult (18 -49 years) females, immunization with half- dose of seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine(TIV) induced antibody responses against H1N1, H3N2,and influenza B antigens that are equivalent to theantibody responses in males who received full-dose TIV(Engler et al., 2008). Across diverse ages, females develop higher antibody responses against either in- fluenza monovalent vaccines or TIV (Cook et al., 2006;Talaat et al., 2010; Fink and Klein, 2015). In contrast,pneumococcal vaccines, which are administered toadults 65 years and older, result in greater antibodyresponses in aged males than in females (Brand\u00e3o et al.,2004; Goldblatt et al., 2009). The sex differences invaccine-induced immunity also influence vaccine effi-cacy and effectiveness. For example, in Guinea-Bissau, the efficacy of the measles vaccine in children tested by measles-associated hospitalizations was better in girlsthan it was in boys (Aaby et al., 2010). Likewise,influenza vaccine studies have consistently shown thatthe risk of influenza-associated hospitalization anddeath is lower in vaccinated females than in vaccinatedmales (Dhakal and Klein, 2019). An analysis in Canadaacross seven influenza seasons reported that the overall vaccine effectiveness was greater in females than males, with the female bias being greatest againstA/H3N2 and influenza B viruses (Chambers et al.,2018). The mechanisms mediating sex differences invaccine-induced immunity are only starting to beexplored in humans, which have provided data onpossible immunomodulatory effects of sex-steroid hor-mones (Furman et al., 2014; Potluri et al., 2019). Animal models are currently providing the most detailed mech- anistic insights into how females develop greater im-munity after vaccination. Immunization with sublethaldoses of either H1N1 or H3N2 influenza A viruses inC57BL/6 mice results in neutralizing antibodytiters in both serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid;cellular immune responses, including memory CD8+T cells responses in the lungs (i.e., the site of infection); and crossprotection against heterologous virus chal- lenge (Lorenzo et al., 2011; Fink et al., 2018). Vaccina-tion of mice with H1N1 vaccine, TIV, orthe quadrivalent inactivated vaccine consistentlyresults in significantly greater quality and quantity ofantibody as well as protection against live virus chal-lenge in female mice as compared with male mice(/C20Zivkovi /C19c et al., 2015, 2018; Fink et al., 2018). Greater immunity in females can be passively transferred tomales through transfer of vaccine-induced antibodies(Fink et al., 2018). The greater antibody responses ininfluenza-vaccinated females compared with males in-volve sex chromosome complement. Both estradiolconcentrations as well as greater expression of theX-linked gene toll-like receptor 7 underlie induction ofgreater antibody responses and protection in adult females compared with males (Fink et al., 2018; Potluri et al., 2019). With aging, influenza vaccine - induced immunity is reduced but to a greater extent infemales than in males among both humans and miceand is associated with declining concentrations ofcirculating estradiol with age in females (Potluri et al.,2019). Sex-steroid hormones impart sex differentialeffects on immunity and protection induced by vaccines, including influenza vaccines. A more detailed explora- tion of the direct contribution of X-linked genes as wellas sex-steroid hormones and their interactions inmediating sex differences to other vaccines is lackingand needs further investigation. Understanding the Sex-Based Pharmacology 749mechanisms of sex differences in immunity to vaccines will help with precision in the development of moreefficacious and safe vaccines, including for coronavirusdisease 2019. Males and females also differ in the uptake and acceptance of vaccines and reporting of vaccine-associated adverse events, which ultimately alsoimpacts the protection provided (Flanagan et al.,2017). Because behavior and beliefs about vaccinesas well as biologic responses to vaccines play roles inmale-female differences, it can be difficult to teaseapart the role of sex and gender effects in the context of vaccines in humans. Acceptance of vaccines, in general, is greater in males than in females (Flanagan et al.,2017). For example, the receipt of TIVs is apparentlylower among females (Bean-Mayberry et al., 2009;Endrich et al., 2009). After receipt of inactivatedvaccines (e.g., TIV), which are administered intramus- cularly, local reactions (e.g., redness, itching, pain,swelling) and systemic adverse events (e.g., fever, nausea, myalgia, rash) are more commonly reported in females than males (Flanagan et al., 2017). Greateradverse events in females are reported after immuni-zation with many different vaccines, including influ-enza, hepatitis B, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, tetanus,pertussis, and yellow Even a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of an adenovirus type- 5-vectored coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine in China reported that females are more likely than males toexperience fever postvaccination (Zhu et al., 2020).Whether reporting of adverse events reflects socialnorms associated with reporting biases between malesand females or biologic sex differences in responses tothe vaccine associated with inflammation remains to bedetermined (Flanagan et al., 2017). The role of patient gender in response to drugs will be discussed in detail in section V. Role of Physician and Patient Gender in Drug Response . G. Oncology Overall, females with cancer have a survival ad- vantage compared with pat ients who are male with cancer (Dong et al., 2020). Although the reasons for this disparity are incompletely understood and likely to be complex, a readily obtainable research goal withgreat clinical significance would be a thorough eval-uation of sex differences in cancer chemotherapy PKand PD. Based on the sex differences in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination describedabove, it is expected that the most commonly prescribed chemotherapeutics including anthracyclines, platinum agents, 5-fluorouracil (5FU), methotrexate, PK because theydepend upon biotransformation for activation ordetoxification as well as renal and biliary excretionfor elimination. Variation in chemotherapy clearancewould affect both tumor and normal tissue exposure and, thus, would be predicted to affect concordantly survival and toxicity in c hemotherapy-responsive cancers. 5FU-containing regimens for colon and esoph- ageal cancers provide a case in point. Across multipleclinical trials involving thousands of patients, femalestreated with 5FU experience greater numbers of adverseevents compared with males (Watanabe et al., 2018;Abdel-Rahman, 2019; Lim et al., 2019; Yamada et al.,2019; Athauda et al., 2020; Wagner et al., 2020), with one study documenting that females completed fewer planned chemotherapy cycles than males (Athaudaet al., 2020). Multiple studies have examined whetherthere are differences in survival between male andfemale patients. Although the literature containsreports with inconsistent findings, in colon cancerthe largest study involving 26,908 patients treated at Mayo Clinic sites between 1972 and 2017 indi- cates that women exhibited a longer median sur- vival time compared with men (89.1 vs. 76.4 months)(Wang et al., 2019). A similar survival advantagehas been reported for esophageal cancer (Athaudaet al., 2020). Females exhibit slower clearance of 5FU than males (Milano et al., 1992), and even though 5FU is among themost commonly prescribed chemotherapeutics, this knowledge has never been integrated into study design for sex-specific dosing. 5FU is primarily metabolized bydihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). in DPD have been associated with increased 5FUtoxicity and in prospective clinical trial have been usedto guide dose modifications, which had the expectedeffects on toxicity (Henricks et al., 2018). In addition topatient genotype, DPD expression levels measured in plasma and saliva were predictive of 5FU area under the curve values and severity of adverse events (Netoet al., 2018). Accordingly, lower levels of DPD expres-sion were associated with better outcome in patientswho were pancreatic and treated with 5FU (Elanderet al., 2018). Notably, intratumoral DPD expressionlevels are lower in female colon cancer specimenscompared with male specimens (Yamashita et al., 2002). Interestingly, in a meta-analysis of three clinical trials comparing conventional with chronomodulatedchemotherapy administration for colon cancer, survivalwas affected by the timing of administration, resultingin improvements in male patients but decreased sur-vival in female patients (Giacchetti et al., 2012). In a ratmodel, DPD expression was shown to be modulated ina circadian manner with peak expression during mid- sleep phase corresponding to the decreased toxicity observed with nighttime dosing in human clinical trials(Abolmaali et al., 2009). Together, these findings indicatehow critically important it could be to evaluate PK asthe basis for sex differences in chemotherapy-induced750 Mauvais-Jarvis et al.toxicity and therapeutic responses to treatment. The fact that DPD genotype has been evaluated for 5FUdose modifications in clinical trial raises the question ofwhy sex differences in 5FU metabolism have not been similarly evaluated. In addition to sex differences in PK affecting out- come and toxicity, sex differences in systems level and cellular biology have the potential to impact PD andtherapeutic responses. Cancer responses to immunecheckpoint inhibition (ICI) represent the clearest ex-ample. Immunotherapy has produced robust responsesin subsets of patients with melanoma (Hodi et al., 2010; Robert et al., 2015), nonsmall cell lung cancer (Brahmer et al., 2015; Reck et al., 2016), and other cancers (Motzeret al., 2015; Ferris et al., 2016). Subsequent meta-analyses of data from randomized clinical trials havefound that male patients benefit more from ICI alonethan do female patients (Conforti et al., 2018; Confortiet al., 2019). Although the mechanistic basis for these differences remains to be completely elucidated, two known mech-anisms may be contributing. The first is the differencesin female versus male immune function and responseto vaccines described above in section F. Immunity and Vaccines . Overall, females exhibit more robust immunity, including antigen-driven immune responses.Thus, the therapeutic index (i.e., potential for pharma-codynamic effect) for increasing neo-antigen immune response in cancer may be lower in females than that in males, resulting in the greater therapeutic responsein males. Sex differences in immunity and immune surveil- lance for neo-antigens could also have more indirecteffects on immunotherapy response. As an example, sexand age effects on immunity have been correlated withdriver mutation profiles (Castro et al., 2020) suggesting that less antigenic neo-epitopes are present in male versus female cancers. Thus, it may be easier to enhancemale immune response if male cancers contain morestrong antigens than female cancers. Sex differences inresponse to ICI may also reflect the greater mutationalburden in male cancers. A consequence of sex differ-ences in antigen-driven immune surveillance would bea higher prevalence of strong antigens in male cancers. In addition, tumor mutational burden, which is reported to be a biomarker of ICI response, is greaterin males versus females (Gupta et al., 2015; Xiao et al.,2016), also predicting that ICI response would begreater in males compared with females. Optimal outcomes in cancer like longer survival and decreased toxicity will require greater personalizationaccording to factors that drive variations in PK and PD. Sex is clearly among the important factors to be considered. As more information becomes availableregarding the biology of sex differences in cancer, it willbe essential to consider how they may alter PK and PDconsiderations.V. Role of Physician and Patient Gender in Drug Response A. Epidemiologic Evidence for Differences in PhysicianGender and Response to Treatment The last section of this review examines the role that gender of the treating physician and/or of the patientmay play in the pharmacological response to drugtreatment and indirectly in the quality of care provided.This potential association has been controversiallydiscussed over the years. Some studies have suggestedthat female physicians provide more comprehensive care than male physicians do for both male and female patients, whereas other studies found no such differ-ence (Gouni-Berthold and Berthold, 2011). A detailedanalysis of the role that physician gender plays in drugtherapy has been recently reviewed (Gouni-Bertholdand Berthold, 2012). 1. Quality of Care. The first major study on this topic examined the association between the gender of primary care physicians (1213 female and 473 male) and the quality of diabetes care they provided to theirpatients in a US population participating in the Trans-lating Research Into Action for Diabetes study (Kimet al., 2005). This study reported that patients treatedby female physicians ( n= 4585) were more likely to receive lipid and HbA1c measurements and to haveLDL-C levels under 130 mg/dl than patients treated by male physicians ( n= 1783). Berthold et al. (2008) also showed that physician gender influences the quality of care in patients with type 2 diabetes and that femalephysicians provided an overall better quality of care,especially in major risk-factor management. They per-formed a cross-sectional study using data from theDUTY (Diabetes mellitus needs unrestricted evaluationof patient data to yield treatment progress) registry in 51,053 outpatients (48.6% male) with type 2 diabetes in Germany treated by 3096 office-based examine processesof care, intermediate outcomes, and medical manage-ment. They found that patients treated by femalephysicians were more often women, more obese, andolder, and they more often had atherosclerotic disease (34% in the total cohort). Using hierarchical regres- sion models, they showed that patients treated byfemale physicians reached glycemic, lipid, and bloodpressure target values significantly more often (14%,16%, and 11%, respectively). Interestingly, althoughpatients treated by female physicians did not receivemore statins than patient st r e a t e db ym a l ep h y s i - cians, they were more like ly to achieve LDL-C goals, suggesting better complianc e/adherence to treatment in patients treated by fem ale physicians. They were also 35% more likely to receive antihypertensive drugtherapy in general and 17% more likely to receiveACE inhibitors in particular. This study led to the Sex-Based Pharmacology 751interesting and humorous suggestion that being treated by male physicians should become a new riskfactor for suboptimal diabetes care (Pedersen, 2009).A subsequent cross-sectional survey of 6537 consecutive patients from Sweden with hypertension (52% women) (Journath et al., 2008) examined the association ofphysician gender with blood pressure, lipid control,and cardiovascular risk factors in men who are hyper-tensive and women treated by 187 male and 77 femaleprimary care physicians. They found that women withhypertension more often reached target systolic/diastolicblood pressure levels ( ,140/90 mm Hg) when treated by female physicians than when treated by male physicians(32% vs. 24%). Furthermore, male and female patientsachieved significantly better control of total and LDL-Clevels when treated by female physicians than whentreated by male physicians. Those results were achievedwith a similar number of drugs prescribed by bothgroups, suggesting again a potential better adherence/compliance by the patients treated by female physi- cians. Baumh\u00e4kel et al. (2009) performed an observa- tional cross-sectional trial in 1857 consecutive patientsfrom Eastern Germany with chronic heart failure andtreated 829 physicians (66% general practitioners,27% internists, and 7% cardiologists) with the purposeof determining the interactions of gender with medicaltreatment of this disease. They found that guideline-recommended drug use and achieved target doses tended to be higher in patients treated by female physicians. There was no difference in the treatment between maleand female patients when treated by female physicians,but male physicians used significantly fewer medicationsin female patients. In a multivariable analysis, an in-dependent predictor of use of the guideline-recommendedbblockers was female physician gender. Notably, a large sample of Massachusetts physicians ( n= 10,408) treating 13 million adult patients was studied to examine therelationship between physician characteristics and per-formance scores on 124 quality measures from RAND 's Quality Assessment Tools (Reid et al., 2010). The authorsfound three physician characteristics to be independentlyassociated with significantly higher overall performance:female gender (1.6% points higher than male, P,0.001), board certification (3.3% points higher than noncerti- fied, P,0.001), and graduatio n from a US medical school (1.0% points higher than international, P,0.001). A Swiss retrospective cohort study of 1001 randomly selected patients (44% women) based on four univer-sity primary care settings and followed by 189 physi-cians (48% men) reported that female physiciansprovided significantly more preventive care than malephysicians to both male (73.4% vs. 70.7%) and female patients (66.7% vs. 63.6%) (Kr\u00e4henmann-M\u00fcller et al., 2014). Even after multivariate adjustment, the differ-ences according to physician gender remained signif-icant. Recently, a study investigated whether patientoutcomes differ between male and female physicians(Tsugawa et al., 2017). Over a 3-year period, theyexamined whether 30-day mortality and readmissionrates between patients 65 years or older hospitalizedwith a medical condition and treated by general internists differed depending on the gender of the treating physician. The aut hors reported that patients treated by female physician s had significantly lower 30-day mortality and lower 30-day readmissions thanpatients cared for by male physicians, even afteraccounting for potential confounders. However, thedifferences were numerically small (around a half %)and the study was criticized for flaws, including the fact that the male and female physician populations were not comparable (Ladouceur, 2017). Another recentstudy from the United States examined patient genderdisparities in survival rates after acute myocardialinfarctions based on the gender of the treating physician(Greenwood et al., 2018). They found higher mortalityamong female patients treated by male physicians.When treated by female physicians, however, both male and female patients experienced similar outcomes. They also observed that male physicians were moreeffective at treating female patients with an acutemyocardial infarction when they worked with femalecolleagues and had treated female patients in the past.Whether these differences were partially related todifferent drug treatment chosen by female and malephysicians was not examined. Taken together, these studies suggest that the differ- ences in practice patterns between male and femalephysicians may have important clinical implications forpatient outcomes. 2. Physician Adherence to Guidelines. A cross- sectional study from Canada (Dahrouge et al., 2016)investigated the relationship between the gender offamily physicians ( n= 4,195, 31% female) and the quality of primary care they provided. They found thatpatients treated by female physicians were significantlymore likely to have received recommended diabetesmanagement drugs, such as ACE/ARB and lipid-lowering agents. Similarly, a French study of 41,453patients with diabetes (53% male) and treated by 2545general practitioners (76% men) showed that femalephysicians were more likely to order three or four HbA1c tests during the year, as required by a local performance indicator regarding the quality of careprovided for patients with diabetes (Chauvel et al.,2013). 3. Patient Adherence to Treatment. Gender differ- ences also exist in patient adherence to treatment. Asdiscussed above (Journath et al., 2008), studies havesuggested a potential better adherence and compliance by patients treated by female physicians compared with patients treated by male physicians (Berthold et al.,2008). Another study from Israel addressed this issue,focusing on 7041 patients with atherosclerosis (61% men)and treated physicians (42.5% men)752 Mauvais-Jarvis et al.for dyslipidemia. They reported that being treated by a male physician was associated with 13% lower adher-ence to the respective pharmacotherapy (Vashitz et al.,2011). B. Potential Explanations for Differences in Physician Gender and Response to Treatment Female physicians may be more careful and conser- vative in their approaches to prescribing drugs, asindicated by the more frequent use of the lower-than-recommended dose of cholinesterase inhibitors inpatients with dementia (Rochon et al., 2018). Altogether, and as previously discussed (Gouni- Berthold and Berthold, 2012), the available evidencefor a role of physician gender in the efficiency of drugtherapy remains relatively small. It seems that femalephysicians may provide better overall drug therapy andspecialized drug therapy in some medical areas. Thereasons for these findings are largely unclear but mayinclude different communication styles and the higher empathy of female doctors (Roter et al., 2002; Phillips and Austin, 2009; Hegazi and Wilson, 2013). Physician 's empathy has been associated with a higher likelihood ofachieving target values of risk factors (Hojat et al.,2011). However, the available literature is limited byinconsistent inclusion of common covariates and a lackof multivariable analyses. Physician/patient communi-cation is also crucial to the quality of drug therapy, for example, for adherence and persistence. Differences in the communication patterns within the four possiblephysician/patient dyads (female or male physician,female or male patient) seem to play a major role(Brink-Muinen et al., 2002). Communication patternsof the dyad female/female were found to differ from theones in the other three dyads, such as that biomedicalpatterns are observed more often than psychosocial ones. An association between gender concordant dyads and cardiovascular risk-factor control and diabetestreatment was found in a large study ( n= 157,458 patients, treated by 972 male and 778 female primarycare physicians) of health insurance data (Schmittdielet al., 2009). It was shown that female patients of femalephysicians had the highest adjusted rates of HbA1ccontrol (HbA1c ,8%) the four patient-physician gender dyads (70% vs. 66% -68%) and that male patients of male physicians were the most likely to beat or below LDL-C target in the four dyads. However,the influence of gender dyads on the quality of drugtherapy has been investigated only in a limited num-bers of studies with inconsistent results, and thus itseffect on treatment remains to be established. Further-more, it is methodologically difficult to separate the influence of the quality of drug therapy from non -drug- related influences in the overall quality of care, espe- cially in the treatment of complex chronic diseases, suchas diabetes, coronary heart disease, or chronic heartfailure (Gouni-Berthold and Berthold, 2012).In conclusion, physician gender as an independent parameter influencing drug therapy is difficult toestablish. As of today, there is no evidence in any areaof medicine to suggest that a patient will consistently receive better quality of drug therapy by switching to a physician of a specific gender. VI. Conclusions and Future Directions Biologic sex is a genetic modifier of the pharmacolog- ical response to drugs. The combination of all sex-specific genetic, epigenetic, and hormonal influences on cellular systems discussed in the first part of this review produces different in vivo male and femalebiologic systems, which results in sex differences inthe PK and PD of multiple drugs, as discussed in thesecond and third parts. These biologic sex differencesare further exacerbated by polymorphisms modifyingdrug response and the interference of menstrual cycle,pregnancy, menopause, age, sexually dimorphic micro- biome, underlying pathophysiology, comedications. Additionally, physician as an in-dependent parameter may influence drug therapy. Thesum of all of these sex and gender influences on thepharmacological response to drugs is summarized in Fig. 3.Since preclinical research has been historically predomi-nantly performed in male experimental models and womenare still underrepresented in clinical trials, women are at greater risk than men of experiencing adverse reactions to most drugs. Several steps can be taken at all levels of thebiomedical enterprise as described below. Consideration of sex and gender to evaluate dispar- ities in drug safety and efficacy is largely absent fromclinical trials, and this should be revisited and beincorporated in an international guideline. Sex andgender should be considered at each step of the research process, from the design of clinical trials to the in- terpretation of the results, with segregation of resultsby sex and/or gender. When justified on the basis ofinitial findings of sex/gender differences, clinical trialsshould be designed and powered to address sex-specificpharmacology. This approach would help develop per-sonalized sex- and gender-specific guidelines for drugefficacy. The pharmaceutical industry should also con- sider sex early in the discovery phase of research, as the acquisition of sex-specific data will inform the designand interpretation of downstream clinical trials thatwill advance the development of therapeutics optimizedby sex. Efforts to bring sex and gender into themainstream of modern medical education should beundertaken. Medical schools use curricula are based onthe physiology of an average man and need to in- corporate sex-based physiology and pharmacology into the early stages of instruction. All clinicians should beaware of sex differences in body surface area, pharma-cokinetics, and pharmacodynamics to avoid overdosingwomen. Potential interaction of drugs with endogenous Sex-Based Pharmacology 753hormones or therapeutically supplied hormones should be considered as well as differences in the adequatedose of drugs between women who are premenopausaland postmenopausal, depending on hormonal status,intestinal uptake, hepatic metabolism, and kidneyfunction. Consideration of sex is one of the pillars of precision medicine. The inherent differences between male andfemale biology should inform drug prescription to pro-mote gender equity in health.Acknowledgments A.K.-W. thanks Peter Klimek from the Center of Science of complex systems of the Medical University of Vienna for his assistance with data analysis and production of Figs. 1 and 2. Authorship Contributions Participated in research Fig. 3. Summary of sex and gender influences on the pharmacological response to drugs. Biologic sex via sex-specific genetic and hormonal influences on cellular systems alters the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of all cells and organs as well as the gut microbiome and influences pharmacokinetics (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of drugs) and pharmacodynamics (e.g., the effect of drugs on receptors, ion channels, enzymes, and signaling pathways). Aging, race, and genetic polymorphism also influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamicsparameters in a sex-specific manner. In women, the hormonal influences of pregnancy, menopause, and the use of OCs also produce sex differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs. Finally, physician gender could add an additional level of difference in response to treatment.754 Mauvais-Jarvis et al.Wrote or contributed to the writing C, Garly ML, Rodrigues A, Biai S, Lisse IM, Whittle H, and Benn CS (2010) Sex differences in the effect of vaccines on the risk of hospi- talization due to measles in -328.
