Innovative Research. Impassioned Patient Care. COM changes culture of education, emphasizing resilience | Educational leaders flow from pipeline at COM, UIC Cancer foe Emil Freireich named Pioneer in Medicine | Alumni reunite while Gala ignites fundraising campaign T Our mission is to enhance the health of the citizens of Illinois by educating physicians, biomedical scientists and innovators, advancing knowledge of health and disease, and providing health care in a setting of education and research. Education We are committed to our educational strategies and to the enhancement of student achievement and leadership. We provide an innovative active-learning educational environment for our diverse body of students, and we are implementing plans to achieve the convergence of engineering and medicine as well as modernize the physical educational spaces in the historic College of Medicine building. Research The College of Medicine will further focus research endeavors on fostering interdisciplinary collaborations in clinical and basic science departments, incorporate engineering-based medical research, and translate this research into clinical applications, including those that address unmet medical needs. Clinical Care We strive to provide value-based, personalized medical care as well as accessible, affordable technological advances to our community in coordination with the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System as we expand our academically distinct clinical and translational programs. HE HUMAN BRAIN IS A CENTRAL ORGAN that governs much of our physical and mental well-being, yet it remains one of the most mysterious biological structures. Although medicine has made significant discoveries in the last 30 years about how the brain functions, we have only just scratched the surface of understanding its complexity. Our cover story this issue takes an in- depth look at how researchers both within the COM and across the University are collaborating to chart new paths and gain insight into this next frontier of medicine\u2014through such diverse areas as anatomy and cell biology, neurology and rehabilitation, neurosurgery, advanced imaging, and psychiatry. Additionally, while the College of Medicine has been implementing a broad curricular update starting with our incoming class of first-year medical students this year, we have also taken a closer look at the well-being and resiliency of our students. The modern medical student encounters a variety of stressors and pressures to understand and achieve in the profession. One aspect of our new curriculum aims to address burnout, anxiety, depression and social isolation by encouraging and teaching coping strategies. We know that students who practice self-care are equipped with the tools to become effective and impactful physicians who care for the health of others. In training the next generation of medical education experts domestically and internationally, the College of Medicine offers a master of health professions education (MHPE) degree, while the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois provides an executive master of health administration (EMHA) program. Graduates of these programs are based across the U.S. and beyond pursuing careers that influence the way we teach the practice of medicine to not only medical students, but also the teachers and leaders in medicine. The impact of our gold-standard department of medical education goes far beyond the walls of our college\u2014it influences medical schools around the globe. This past fall, we also celebrated our tradition of excellence with our many outstanding alumni and donors. During our annual reunion, visitors heard about the many changes to the college's facilities and curriculum as well as groundbreaking faculty research. Visitors also attended the Illinois Medicine Gala, where they feted Root Society members and the 2017 Illinois Medicine Award winners: Emil Freireich as Pioneer in Medicine, Terry Mason as Distinguished Alumnus, Janet Lin as Emerging Innovator, Bruce Gillis as Innovator of Today, and James and Marion Grant for the Spirit of Medicine, all of whom are profiled in this issue. The Gala also launched the fundraising campaign for the COM as part of \"IGNITE: The Campaign for UIC,\" as we celebrated the exciting future of medicine that happens here. We hope that all of our alumni and friends will participate in this campaign because you are truly the spark that ignites our future.

A process the COM started formulating in 2015, the redesigned approach to medical education is more tightly focused on clinical relevance and integrates perspectives on basic, clinical and social sciences alongside themes of health care systems, health and society, and professional development to allow students to contextualize how these aspects influence the delivery of modern health care. The updated curriculum offers earlier clinical experience to students, thematically blocked information, and a more holistic approach that includes such topics as student wellness and resilience (see p. 12). Peoria Regional Dean Sara Rusch, MD, Res '81, underscores that this new approach better positions the school among peers and within the wider medical community. \"We are phasing in a new curriculum that is more clinically relevant, OR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES, the University of Illinois College of Medicine is ushering in a dramatic change to the way medical students are taught across all campuses. After many months of assessment and preparation, faculty, administrators and students this school year have launched the updated Illinois Medicine Curriculum, which has brought consistency and standardization across the multiple COM sites as the Peoria and Rockford campuses also welcomed first year medical students, expanding their programs to become full four-year medical school curricula. \"Our innovative approach to medical education is based on the idea of evolving the one-size-fits-all method of teaching that has been used for decades,\" says Raymond Curry, MD, FACP , senior associate dean for educational affairs. \"The updated curriculum will ensure that students are proficient in all learning objectives, while also allowing students to assess their campus news CHICAGO PEORIA ROCKFORD URBANA-CHAMPAIGN FLAUNCHING A NEW ERA OF MEDICAL EDUCATION COM begins updated curriculum and welcomes M1s in Peoria and RockfordPHOTOS: LLOYD DEGRANE AND CARRIE HERMANSON ROCKFORD (this page) The College of Medicine and Rockford communities came together to celebrate the updated facilities on the Rockford Health Sciences Campus in August 2017. The 56 first-year medical students who started in Rockford later that month have started using updated spaces such as the virtual anatomy lab and clinical skills simulation areas. PEORIA (opposite page) To welcome 58 new first-year students last fall, Peoria opened 10,000 square feet of newly renovated educational spaces including a technology-rich Learning Studio, a new anatomy wing and a \"student oasis.\" The updated spaces were dedicated during an open house celebration that welcomed alumni and the Peoria community last July. ILLINOIS MEDICINE | 5LAUNCHING A NEW ERA OF MEDICAL EDUCATION COM begins updated curriculum and welcomes M1s in Peoria and Rockford PHOTOS: DARYL WILSON PHOTOGRAPHYprovides greater clinical experiences, incorporates broader areas of health, uses innovative educational methodologies, and focuses on student wellness and resilience,\" she says. \"Whether they want to become a primary care physician in a rural community, a neurosurgeon or an academic, we are preparing them with the skill sets they need.\" Students are taught by employing thematically blocked content, including pathogenesis, circulation and respiration, and brain and behavior, among other themes. Each blocked sequence is then capped with a synthesis week that offers students the opportunity to reflect and see where they need additional understanding of concepts. This approach offers greater ownership and direction of the learning process to students themselves. \"These first-year students receiving all four years of medical education in Rockford will allow them to become more involved with the community, pursue long-term research projects and create lifelong ties to Rockford,\" says Rockford Regional Dean Alex Stagnaro-Green, MD, MHPE. \"Based on our economic impact study, the coming of these M1 students will also add $2.2 million in annual economic impact to the community.\" In addition to updated educational offerings across the college, Peoria and Rockford needed to modernize and build teaching and learning spaces to accommodate the additional first-year medical students. During the fall of 2017, Peoria welcomed 58 first-year students whille Rockford had 56 first-year medical students at orientation. In Peoria, new educational spaces include a technology-rich Learning Studio, a new anatomy wing and a \"student oasis,\" which totaled about 10,000 square feet of renovations. Similarly, in Rockford, the educational spaces were updated to also include an anatomy lab and additional group work areas. Given that the new Illinois Medicine Curriculum is designed around the concept of team-based learning, these spaces needed to offer the flexibility for large and small-group learning. \u2014 Michael Wesbecher6 | SUMMER 2017LEADERS IN EMERGENCY FORM SIREN COM joins national emergency medicine network HE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE HAS JOINED a newly formed national network that will collaborate to conduct clinical trials aimed at improving outcomes for emergency room patients. The network, called SIREN (Strategies to Innovate EmeRgENcy Care Clinical Trials Network), will pool resources and boost patient numbers for emergency medicine clinical trials. \"The SIREN network enables us to recruit patients across dozens of hospitals and lets us focus on determining the best ways we can care for vulnerable patients,\" says Marina del Rios, MD, assistant professor of emergency medicine at the COM and co-principal investigator on SIREN. Trials that tap into SIREN will have access to minority and underserved populations that have traditionally been left out of clinical trials. Patients enrolled in SIREN clinical trials will be tracked after they leave the ER to follow outcomes. SIREN is a nationwide network of emergency departments led by 11 clinical centers called hubs. COM is part of the Mid-America SIREN Hub, which also includes Northwestern Medicine, University of Chicago, Indiana University, the University of Texas Southwestern, and the Medical College of Wisconsin.COM Unveils Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cell Center THE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE HAS LAUNCHED a new center to focus on understanding tissue regeneration and pioneering future developments in stem cell biology to repair diseased organs and tissues. The University of Illinois Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine is the first in Chicago dedicated to these topics with a focus on basic biology and translational science. Researchers in the new center are investigating the molecular signals that drive stem cells to mature into different cell types, as well as studying the epigenetic regulation of stem cells; the best approaches to transplant engineered cells, tissues and organs; and methods to efficiently produce the regenerative cells needed for novel treatments. \"The center will use a team-oriented, multidisciplinary approach that incorporates experts in biochemistry, biophysics, bioengineering and the clinical sciences to investigate stem cell biology and tissue regeneration,\" says Asrar Malik, PhD, the Schweppe Family Distinguished Professor and head of pharmacology, who is guiding the effort. The current program in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine already includes seven faculty members, most within the department of pharmacology, who together have more than $10 million in research grants from the National Institutes of Health. Three new faculty members have joined the center in the last two years, and Malik expects to add more.CELLS THAT 'GO OUT WITH A BANG' 'Exploding' cells contribute to high death rate in bloodstream infections COM RESEARCHERS have found that cells lining blood vessels in the lungs exposed to bacterial toxins called lipopolysaccharides don't die easily\u2014 instead, an explosive form of cell death known as pyroptosis occurs. And this contributes to a high death rate among those who experience acute lung injury. \"There are multiple ways a cell can die,\" says Jalees Rehman, MD, associate professor of medicine and pharmacology in the COM and co-lead author on the paper, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. \"In pyroptosis, cells go out with a bang.\" Acute lung injury, experienced by approximately 200,000 people in the U.S. every year, can be fatal in 30 to 40 percent of cases. The current standard treatment is supportive care, such as artificial ventilation. \"Our work shows that pyroptosis of endothelial cells that line blood vessels may be one of the reasons why bacterial infections can cause such severe injury to the lung in some patients,\" says Asrar Malik, PhD, Schweppe Family Distinguished Professor and head of pharmacology, and co-lead author on the paper.T ILLINOIS MEDICINE | 7INNOVATIONS IN MEDICAID COM collaboration with MeridianHealth wins 'best practice' award HE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE'S COORDINATED HEALTH CARE FOR COMPLEX KIDS (CHECK) program, a collaborative effort with MeridianHealth, has received the \"2017 Most Innovative Best Practice\" award in the Children's Health category from the Institute for Medicaid Innovation. The partners have focused on Medicaid-enrolled children with complex medical conditions and chronic diseases to fill the gaps in service that this population faces. The joint submission, \"A Model of Care: Care Coordination for Complex Kids,\" is a program focused on reducing healthcare costs, absentee school rates, and fostering better patient and family engagement in care management. The CHECK program focuses on four main conditions: diabetes, sickle cell disease, asthma and prematurity, says Pamela Roper, MD, MPH, pediatrician at the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System. But it goes beyond simple treatment. \"CHECK is a program that focuses on the non-medical barriers to healthcare,\" she says. Adds Andrea Pappalardo, MD, another pediatrician and an allergist-immunologist at UI Health, \"We're making people feel empowered to take charge of their own health care by maybe finding transportation to the pharmacy, if they don't have it, [or] maybe helping with a three-way call, navigating through the ridiculous amount of prompts in making an appointment.\" Benjamin Van Voorhees, MD, MPH, head of pediatrics for UI Health, says the system chose the four conditions because they're difficult to manage, result in missing school days and thus can lower likelihood of high school graduation, and also they're very costly to the health system. \"[Providers] work seamlessly together to understand the unique situation of every particular child,\" he says. \"This keeps the communication flowing better. It's a way to use each one's skills more efficiently.\"T he University of Illinois at Chicago has received $6.75 million from the National Institutes of Health to establish a specialized Center of Excellence in minority health and health disparities research. The Center for Health Equity Research (CHER) will investigate how social determinants impact the health of marginalized groups. \"The vast majority of preventable disease in the U.S. happens in a small group of minority communities,\" says Robert Winn, MD, associate vice chancellor for community-based practice on the Chicago campus and director of the University of Illinois Cancer Center, who is corresponding principal investigator. \"These groups are socially disadvantaged due to geography, poverty or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation.\" CHER will focus initially on three research projects, one of which will be led by COM assistant professor of medicine Lisa Tussing-Humphreys, PhD, MS, RD, a fellow of the Institute for Health Research and Policy, who along with colleagues will study how colorectal cancer risk in the black community correlates to experiences of racism. \"The end goal is to get to a point where my health and your health is not determined by the color of our skin, where we live, or who we live with,\" says Jesus Ramirez-Valles, PhD, professor and director of community health sciences in the UIC School of Public Health. Martha Daviglus, MD, PhD, associate vice chancellor for research at UIC, says a second goal of CHER is to invest in the career development of minority researchers. UIC is one of 12 centers nationwide and the only one in the Midwest to be funded by the NIH's Health Disparities' Center of Excellence program. The COM is one of seven entities at the university to participate.NARROWING HEALTH DISPARITIES New health equity research center established on Chicago campus TPHOTO: UI CANCER CENTER UIC faculty and administrators (from left) Jesus Ramirez-Valles, Martha Daviglus and Robert Winn are pleased with the $6.75 million NIH grant the campus received to establish the Center for Health Equity Research, which will examine how social determinants impact the health of marginalized groups.8 | SPRING 2018DOES CHRONIC INFLAMMATION CONTRIBUTE TO OVARY DYSFUNCTION? NIH-funded study will look at effects of anti-inflammatory drug on polycystic ovary syndrome HE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE CHICAGO HAS RECEIVED A $3 MILLION FEDERAL GRANT to study the effects of inflammation on polycystic ovary syndrome. Affecting one in seven women, PCOS is an endocrine system disorder that disrupts the menstrual cycle and impedes ovulation. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, will look at the role of inflammation in 90 women with PCOS. Principal investigator Frank Gonz\u00e1lez, MD, says the goal is to understand the underlying mechanisms of the syndrome. \"While we have made great strides in helping women with PCOS, we need more research to understand exactly what happens in the body to cause the ovaries to malfunction,\" says Gonz\u00e1lez, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology, and director of the laboratory for reproductive endocrine and inflammation research. Gonz\u00e1lez and his research team will randomize patients into two groups. The control group will receive a placebo, and the study group will receive a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug called salsalate. \"We expect that women with PCOS receiving salsalate treatment will exhibit evidence of ovulation, decreased ovarian androgen secretion and reduced inflammation,\" Gonz\u00e1lez says.TDIET AND RISK COM-Peoria two-year NIH grant to study Alzheimer's disease T'S WELL-KNOWN THAT THE FOOD WE EAT can have a short-term impact on our waistline, but longer term it can have implications for our brain health, according to COM researchers. The latter will be the focus of a nearly $440,000, two-year grant that Ken-ichiro Fukuchi, MD, PhD, a professor in cancer biology and pharmacology at the COM Peoria, has received from the National Institutes of Health. He will expand a study examining a link between a high-fat diet and greater risk for Alzheimer's disease. Fukuchi's research focuses on a specific molecule, a type of microRNA, that's elevated in the blood of animal models with Alzheimer's disease and with Type 2 diabetes. \"These increased levels induce brain endothelial cell dysfunction, or a dysfunctional blood-brain barrier, which lead to an increased risk or early onset and accelerated progression of Alzheimer's disease,\" Fukuchi says. \"More importantly, we believe this microRNA may provide new strategies for therapies or prevention against Alzheimer's disease.\" A high-fat diet is strongly associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes, while sustained alterations in blood glucose levels caused by obesity and Type 2 diabetes promote vascular inflammation and blood-brain barrier impairment. The latter, in turn, is believed to lead to the accumulation of toxic plaques, neuroinflammation, neuronal dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and ultimately dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Determining the role microRNA plays in the inflammation and dysfunction in the blood-brain barrier could stop this domino effect and halt the progression of Alzheimer's disease, which affects more than 5 million people in the U.S. \"An urgent need exists to identify the molecular mechanisms that increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease and to develop preventive and therapeutic measures,\" Fukuchi says. COM Peoria Professor Ken-ichiro Fukuchi has received a nearly $440,000 grant to expand a study that has examined the possible connection between eating a high-fat diet and contracting Alzheimer's disease. I PHOTO: LLOYD DEGRANEILLINOIS MEDICINE | 9HE NATIONAL CENTER FOR RURAL HEALTH PROFESSIONS, part of the College of Medicine Rockford, has received five additional years of competitive grant funding totaling nearly $6.9 million from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration. The HRSA grant will go for the continuation of the Illinois Area Health Education Center (IL AHEC) Network Program, established in 2010, which has eight regional centers throughout the state, including one jointly based at the COM Chicago campus and the UIC School of Public Health. The centers serve both rural and urban underserved residents through access to health professions education, health careers development, and community and public health promotion activities. The grant funding will allow for the continuation and expansion of these programs and the establishment of a ninth regional AHEC center serving the suburban counties around Chicago. Through previous network efforts, more than 60,000 participants have been a part of Illinois AHEC-supported programs, which are part of the National AHEC Organization developed by Congress in 1971. Renewed Grant for Rockford Health Education Program T TUI HEALTH JOINS SUPPORTIVE ONCOLOGY COLLABORATIVE NIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS HOSPITAL & HEALTH SCIENCES SYSTEM HAS JOINED A ONE-OF-A-KIND PARTNERSHIP to bring supportive oncology tools and resources to cancer-care providers in the Chicago area. UI Health physicians and medical staff, including Mary Pasquinelli, NP; Ana Gordon, Deliu, are among 135 providers from 35 Chicago-area health systems working with the Supportive Oncology Collaborative. The SOC, established and funded by The Coleman Foundation in 2014, designs and tests process improvements, creates screening tools and training, and advocates with payers to cover supportive oncology care services. Aimed to address cancer patients' psychological, social, physical and practical concerns, these services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams of oncologists, physician assistants, social workers and clergy. \"University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System is proud to be a part of this unique partnership,\" Pasquinelli says. \"Their work has created evidence-based tools and resources that are available to all cancer-care providers so their patients may have access to the physical, emotional and psychological support they need.\"U HE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE PEORIA WILL RECEIVE $1.25 MILLION over the next three years from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to assist low- income people living with HIV/AIDS and their families. The local grant, aimed at those in central Illinois, is a small slice of $37 million in nationwide awards announced in December by HUD to provide a combination of housing assistance and supportive services for this vulnerable population. \"This is designed to provide assistance to individuals living with HIV and to help establish stable housing,\" says Pam Briggs, director of administrative operations at Positive Health Solutions, a program based at the COM Peoria that has provided comprehensive medical care and services to persons living within a 15-county area in central Illinois since 1994. PROVIDING AID FOR HIV/AIDS POPULATION Peoria HIV/AIDS program receives $1.25 million renewal from HUD for low-income sufferers \"There's a lot of additional expenses with this disease that makes it hard to make ends meet.\" A stable home is critical to the well-being of those living with HIV/AIDS and results in better health outcomes and reduced transmission of the disease, HUD says. The grant will provide rental assistance, including case managers and social service coordinators, for up to 55 people living in central Illinois during each of the three years. The grant also will provide permanent housing placement services for up to 75 people over the three-year period. Briggs says there is a waiting list at the moment, but she adds that as people become more stable, they hopefully will be able to transition to private housing and no longer need the funding assistance, allowing others living with HIV to receive grant funding. Similar assistance was provided in a previous three-year grant from 2014 to 2017. AZAR RESIGNS AS EXECUTIVE DEAN; RAY BECOMES INTERIM DEAN Dimitri Azar, MD, MBA, stepped down as executive dean of the College of Medicine on March 15, and Charles Ray, MD, PhD, MS \u2014 acting dean since Azar took a leave of absence in July 2017\u2014was named interim dean. The College dean since 2011, Azar will continue as senior director of ophthalmologic innovation at Verily Life Sciences while remaining on the COM faculty on a part-time basis as professor of ophthalmology, bioengineering and pharmacology, as well as B.A. Field Chair in Ophthalmologic Research. An internationally recognized ophthalmic surgeon, Azar joined the COM in 2006 as head of the department of ophthalmology & visual sciences. During his tenure as dean, the College made significant advances across all of its campuses in areas like learner-centered education, clinically relevant translational research and high-quality patient care. Previously, Azar served as a tenured professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, director of the Cornea Service at Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary, senior scientist at Schepens Eye Institute, and a faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Before Ray became acting dean, he served as head of the department of radiology at the COM for more than four years, and he is an accomplished clinician and researcher with more than 18 years of administrative experience. A pioneer in translational research focusing on oncologic interventions and pain management, Ray served as president of the Society of Interventional Radiology from 2016-17 and has been on the executive council of the society for 12 years. DAVIS WINS LIEBER PRIZE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH John Davis, MD, Gilman Professor of Psychiatry and Research in the COM, has won the Lieber Prize in Outstanding Achievement in Schizophrenia Research from the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation. A giant in the field, Davis and his colleagues introduced the notion that major mental illness may be caused by biochemical abnormalities, and his group was among the first to study the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of psychotropic drugs. Davis also helped develop the statistical method known as meta- analysis as a way to pool scientific data; his group published the second meta-analysis overall and the first in the field of psychiatry. The results indicated that patients with schizophrenia were less likely to have relapses if they took their anti-psychotic medications for the long term, a concept now well known as maintenance therapy. Currently, Davis is studying gene expression abnormalities in schizophrenia and conducts clinical trials addressing the disease. MAKI RECOGNIZED WITH AMWA WOMAN IN SCIENCE AWARD Pauline Maki, PhD, senior research director of the Center for Research on Women and Gender at the COM Chicago, has received the Woman in Science Award from the American Medical Women's Association. Her research over the last 20 years has focused on menopause, sex steroids, and the founder of the International School of Robotic Surgery, which since 2003 has trained more than 750 surgeons from 24 countries. ALTER RECEIVES SEE HUMANITARIAN OF THE YEAR AWARD Daniel Alter, MD '92, PhD '93, has received a 2017 Humanitarian of the Year Award from SEE International, in honor of World Sight Day, and to recognize the outstanding dedication and achievement of volunteer ophthalmologists committed to ending avoidable blindness worldwide. Alter has traveled to Haiti 12 times over the past two years to assist citizens of the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, and one that has been devastated by natural disasters over the past decade.

MICHEL EARNS FULBRIGHT, WILL COLLABORATE WITH CRISTANCHO Joanna Michel, PhD '06, instructor of medical education at the COM Chicago and associate director of the University of Illinois at Chicago Urban Medicine Program, has received a Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program award to study how women displaced from rural to urban areas in Medellin, Colombia, use medicinal and nutritional plants in their health care practices. Also an affiliate professor in the UIC School of Public Health, Michel is one of 800 faculty and professionals who are traveling abroad during the 2017- 2018 academic year through the program, the flagship international educational exchange sponsored by the U.S. government. Her four-month research project is a collaboration with Sergio Cristancho, PhD, assistant professor at the COM Rockford and professor of public health at the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin. The project will center on how dramatic migration to urban areas caused by ongoing armed conflict in Colombia has changed women's use of plants for medicinal and nutritional purposes. LEOW CO-LEADS WINNING MOOD DISORDER RESEARCH TEAM Alex Leow, MD, PhD, an associate professor of both psychiatry and bioengineering, has co-led a team of researchers that has won the Mood Challenge for ResearchKit. That's a contest launched by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to come up with new ways to study mood disorders using Apple's ResearchKit, an open- source platform for creating iOS apps. The team of researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago, also co-led by Peter Nelson, PhD, professor of computer science and dean of the College of Engineering, along with collaborators at the University of Michigan and Sage Bionetworks, developed a mobile app called BiAffect. The app unobtrusively monitors device usage, including keyboard dynamics such as typing speed, to predict manic and depressive episodes in people with bipolar disorder. The BiAffect team will receive the $200,000 grand prize to continue to refine and launch its app in the App Store. \"The vision for BiAffect is for it to serve as a kind of 'fitness tracker' for the brain,\" Leow says. \"The Mood Challenge helped us to realize this vision, and the finished app will be a first-of-its-kind tool for researchers to study mood disorders and even cognitive disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.\" BiAffect also will help researchers determine the efficacy of different treatments for bipolar and other mood disorders. ILLINOIS MEDICINE | 11 HOLTERMAN EARNS INNOVATIVE RESEARCH AWARD Mark Holterman, MD, PhD, a professor of surgery and pediatrics at the COM Peoria, has earned an Innovative Research Award from the American Diabetes Association for groundbreaking research conducted through the Core Research Program. Previously honored with the same award from ADA, Holterman has spent more than 20 years as a practitioner at OSF St. Francis Medical Center. The American Diabetes Association has supported more than 5,000 research initiatives in the field of diabetes over the past 60 years, funding research work in diabetes etiology and addressing the challenges faced by researchers in studies that use humans as research subjects. A specialist in pediatric surgery, Holterman's research interests include novel cancer treatment, stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine. He earned his MD and PhD from University of Virginia and undertook a fellowship in pediatric surgery at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital. Holterman previously worked at Rush University Medical Center as an attending pediatric surgeon. RIFKIN NAMED CHAIR OF MEDICINE IN ROCKFORD Gary Rifkin, MD, has been named chair of the department of medicine at the College of Medicine Rockford. A professor of clinical medicine and infectious diseases, Rifkin joined the faculty of the COM in 1978 and has served in various roles in teaching, administration and clinical practice, including the vice chair and acting chair for the department of medicine. Rifkin has won several university awards, including three Golden Apple Teaching Awards, the Distinguished Service Award, Distinguished Teaching Award and two Council for Excellence in Teaching and Learning Awards. A graduate of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, Rifkin completed an internship and residency in internal medicine and an infectious disease fellowship at the University of Michigan Medical Center. He is board-certified in internal medicine and infectious diseases and is a fellow of the American College of Physicians and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. He maintained a clinical practice with Rockford Infectious Disease Consultants and served as physician epidemiologist at several area medical centers from 1978 until 2012. Mark Holterman Gary Rifkin Alex Leow Joanna Michel Evelyn FigueroaI 12 | SPRING 2018It's three months into Aisha Bhatti's first year at the College of Medicine's Rockford campus. But Bhatti isn't in class or hitting the books at the moment. Surrounded by a handful of other medical students seeking a temporary respite from the rigors of preclinical coursework, she's dipping her brush into a vivid green glob of paint and dabbing it onto the nature scene taking shape on her canvas. Totally absorbed in the act of creation, she hasn't thought about her upcoming block exam for a full 45 minutes. \"I have a background in art, so I was excited when I first heard about these art therapy workshops,\" recalls the 23-year-old Glenview native a few months later. \"Of course, like every other medical student, my first thought was, 'I should study instead.' But I decided to go for it, and I was so glad that I did. I came out of that workshop feeling relaxed and happy. It was very cathartic to use a different part of my brain.\" Bhatti's art therapy experience is just one of the new programs designed to foster medical student resilience and well-being at the COM's Chicago, Peoria and Rockford medical campuses. It's also a sign of the changing culture of medical education as the University of Illinois and other top schools mobilize to address medical student stress, depression and burnout. Although the depression rate for students entering medical school is roughly comparable to that of their nonmedical peers, the prevalence of depression increases disproportionately among medical students over the course of their education and training, according to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine . A Mayo Clinic study of more than 4,200 students at seven U.S. medical schools found that roughly half (49.6 percent) of medical students were suffering from burnout, and 11.2 percent had experienced suicidal ideation within the past year. The COM has concluded that medical students need the tools to heal themselves as they prepare for a lifetime of caring for others. Educational evolution IN 2015, THEN-COM EXECUTIVE DEAN DIMITRI AZAR , MD, MBA, invited administrative leaders, faculty, staff and students across the college's campuses to brainstorm how to change the culture of medical education to support higher levels of student well-being and resilience. It was a synergistic moment to initiate such a conversation. Raymond Curry, MD, FACP, senior associate dean for educational affairs, had just launched the college's first curriculum redesign in more than three decades. \"We believe that our students should thrive, not just survive,\" says Abbas Hyderi, MD '01, MPH, associate dean for curriculum. \"Our objectives were to promote individual well-being while sustaining academic performance; address student anxiety, depression and burnout; and train future physicians to serve as role models while supporting the well-being of their patients and peers.\" Geri Fox, MD '83, MHPE '04, associate dean for wellness and resilience, studied medical student well-being and mapped out a robust wellness curricular approach that would help students manage the demands of medical school while taking better care of themselves. This undertaking would lead Fox, a professor of clinical psychiatry, and the members of the Task Force on Student Well-Being and Resilience deep into the inner workings of the medical student psyche. They explored the debilitating effects of fatigue and social isolation, the divisive nature of a competitive class ranking system, and the feelings of futility and burnout arising from the preclinical firehose of information students must master. \"Our overall goal as we mapped out this curricular approach was to help medical students learn how to help themselves and their by Susan Reichholistic medical education A Curricular Prescription for WELL-BEING As the College of Medicine rolls out its innovative new curriculum, first-year students are already reaping the benefits of a wellness-oriented approach to medical education RIGHT: Although she keeps her nose to the medical school grindstone most of the time, student Aisha Bhatti has found short breaks for wellness activities like art therapy workshops to be reinvigorating both personally and academically.

The wellness curriculum is intended to help our highly competent students stay resilient in the face of these challenges.\" The new Illinois Medicine Curriculum, which was rolled out to first-year students in August 2017, represents a radical departure from the traditional\u2014or \"classic\" medical school curriculum (see Campus News, p. 4). \"We've integrated wellness into this new framework in a variety of ways,\" explains Fox. \"For instance, if the students have a case study about a patient with panic attacks, we may include relevant information for medical students about anxiety. During each synthesis week [immediately after exams], the students have two hours set aside for a wellness plenary, which is followed by small group discussions.\" These have covered topics such as recognizing burnout, sleep hygiene and the importance of self-compassion. Fox emphasizes that medical students are invited to suggest other areas in which the COM also can improve support. Gerald Wickham, MA, EdD, assistant dean for medical education and evaluation in Peoria, surveyed M1 students midway through the current academic year to gather data about the wellness programming in general and the plenaries in particular. Of the 67 percent of first- years who responded to the survey, nearly all (92 percent) said the curriculum on wellness was an important part of their medical school experience, 71 percent felt they had gained new insights about wellness, and 66 percent believed that the synthesis week wellness plenaries had improved their well-being. The survey results are heartening to Meenakshy Aiyer, MD, FACP, associate dean for academic affairs in Peoria. \"This positive s there a place for poetry in medical school? Kristi Kirschner, MD, thinks so. When first-year medical students were learning about anatomy, in came the Poetry Foundation to conduct a small group activity about the body that involved writing poems about cadavers, says Kirschner, a visiting clinical professor in the College of Medicine's department of medical education and the leader of the Health Humanities Curriculum task force in the new COM curriculum. Kirschner and her fellow task-force members\u2014who represent the fields of medical history, philosophy and ethics, sociology, disability studies and literature in medicine\u2014have spent nearly two years integrating experiences like this into the new Illinois Medicine Curriculum. Tied into curricular themes, these new health humanities experiences range from philosophical discussions about professional ethics, to a conversation with a disabled artist about using art to hone observation skills about the body. Students also have a chance to sample a variety of elective health humanities experiences through medical colloquia. Students can choose to participate in such activities as a writing group, a graphic medicine session (a relatively new field that uses comics in health care education), a panel discussion with patients talking about living with illness or disabilities, or engagement with a medical historian about the way medicine has treated bodily differences over time. COM artists have also re-energized Body Electric , a journal of literary and visual arts created by medical students with support from faculty members in the department of medical education. \"Our students spend a lot of time in medical school studying diseases and drugs and cells, but to apply all of that knowledge in the context of a human life requires an understanding of the patient experience at the human level,\" Kirschner says. \"Things don't always present clearly or neatly in medicine. We believe that working with different modalities in the arts and humanities can help students understand how to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty, which is a very large part of medicine.\" \u2014 Susan ReichTHE POETRY OF MEDICINE Kristi KirschnerFirst-year medical students at the COM have been the first cohort to experience and provide feedback about the updated Illinois Medicine Curriculum, which was rolled out in August and integrates a wellness framework in a variety of ways.PHOTOS: DIANE SMUTNYILLINOIS MEDICINE | 15feedback shows that we are making progress as we work together to build a community of competent and caring future physicians who demonstrate self-compassion and have a sense of work-life balance. This will help them to provide high-quality, compassionate care for their patients while caring for themselves as well,\" she says. Kathleen Kashima, PhD, senior associate dean of students in Chicago, sees the teaching of wellness as self-perpetuating. \"If our students learn the fundamentals of personal well-being during medical school, they will pass on that knowledge when they become residents and faculty and start teaching the next class of medical students,\" she says. Student-led support EACH CAMPUS IS ALSO DEVELOPING its own extracurricular wellness programs, an endeavor that has benefited greatly from the commitment and enthusiasm of a committed corps of student leaders. One of these leaders is Cory Reiter, an MD/PhD candidate in the Medical Scientist Training Program in Chicago. Reiter, who helped develop the new curriculum as member of both the Student Curricular Board and the Student Wellness and Resilience Committee, is now helping to expand extracurricular wellness programs as chair of the latter. A passionate advocate for student wellness, Reiter's sense of mission grew out of personal experience. \"When I was a pre-med student, I had a sick mom, and that was a priority that I couldn't compromise on,\" she confides. \"So I compromised on other things, such as going out with friends, or going to the gym, or cooking healthy food. What I learned is that you can only push yourself like that for so long before it begins to have an impact on your cognitive acuity or your emotional stability.\" Reiter and her fellow wellness committee members continue to support the well-being of their peers in a variety of ways, from bringing in massage therapists, to organizing events to relieve student stress, to advocating for the installation of a Farmer's Fridge vending machine on the medical campus, which fuels students around the clock with salads, fruits and other healthy offerings. A new culture of well-being ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS A WORK IN PROGRESS , the holistic wellness and resilience program is already sparking a culture change. \"We need to promote and empower wellness in our patients,\" says Connie Vitali, MD, assistant dean for medical education and evaluation in Rockford. \"But, to do this, shouldn't physicians be well themselves? By intentionally teaching our students how to take care of themselves, we are laying the groundwork for a culture change that will profoundly affect not only physicians but also their patients. There's some hidden gold here that we are not going to see until these students hit their third and fourth years and move into their internships.\" \"We know that stress is inevitable in medical school,\" reflects Terri Blevins, MA, EdD, Rockford assistant dean for student and alumni affairs. \"But we are already seeing signs that we are helping our students learn how to deal with this stress in a healthy way. The students love the small group discussions about different aspects of well-being and report that they feel very supported and connected to the faculty and one another. They've already orchestrated a number of extracurricular activities amongst themselves, from a murder mystery dinner to a potluck night and a barn dance. As I watch this class, I'm seeing some real moments of joy.\" Bhatti credits the new culture of wellness with helping her maintain a better school/life balance. \"The new curriculum not only facilitates learning and makes the first-year experience less stressful, but gives me some time to engage in pursuits that help me recharge,\" she says. Cory Reiter, an MD/PhD candidate in the Medical Scientist Training Program, has helped lead efforts to survey students on their wellness going into board exams, organize peer-to-peer support, launch an online mental health screening tool with the Counseling Center, and bring mental health to the west campus by making a counselor available weekly to medical students. But most important, she says, have been efforts to encourage students to talk about wellness, both to remove stigma and to underscore the fact that caring for oneself is a skill set that requires training and persistence to refine.

College of Medicine researchers are working with colleagues from around the University of Illinois at Chicago campus and beyond to crack the code, attempting to understand the structure and function of the brain itself by using big data to decipher cures for degenerative diseases; de - veloping quantitative tools that optimize treatment for stroke patients; and finding the most effective treatments to improve mental-health issues. Energized by the priority placed on brain health research by UIC Chancellor Michael D. Amiridis, PhD, faculty from such diverse disciplines as biology, bioengineering, psychology, neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, and anatomy and cell biology are collaborating across campus with one focus: creating discoveries and advancements in the areas of brain health that will most directly benefit patients. They are making progress on all fronts. Anatomy and cell biology: Deciphering degenerative diseases TO GET TO THE ROOT OF BRAIN DISEASE , the depart - ment of anatomy and cell biology begins with the basics: trying to understand the structure and capabilities of the human brain. \"The brain is the most complicated machine of which we are aware on this planet,\" says Simon Alford, PhD, department head and the Mary & Raymond Nester Sweeney Professor of Basic Sciences. \"In the last 30 years, we've discovered more about the brain than mankind had previously learned throughout history, and we're still just scratching the surface.\" Alford and others in his department, such as Scott Brady, PhD, are expanding the fundamental knowledge of how the brain works\u2014necessary to address the diseases that impact it\u2014through research that bridges cellular biology and neuroscience. Their research focuses on the mechanisms and effects of synaptic plasticity, meaning changes that occur at synapses, the junc - tions between neurons that allow them to communicate. \"We need to How Illinois Medicine is unraveling one of medicine's biggest mysteries MAXIMIZING BRAIN HEALTH 18 | SPRING 2018understand the basic science of how the brain works in order to fully address the diseases that affect brain health,\" Al - ford says. Research in the anatomy and cell biology labs already has yielded discoveries that could change the course of some of the most devastating degenerative diseases in future clinical applications. For example, Ernesto Bongarzone, PhD, and Maria Givogri, PhD, comprise one of only a dozen research groups in the nation to receive a 2017 Catalyst Award from the Dr. Ralph and Marian Falk Medical Research Trust Awards program. The $300,000, one-year award will further their research on turning naturally occurring extracellular vesicles\u2014tiny \"bubbles\" given off by a range of cell types\u2014into targeted delivery vehicles for drugs to treat multiple sclerosis. The team is also working on a genet - ic modification model for Krabbe disease, a disorder that destroys the protective coating (myelin) of nerve cells in the brain and throughout the nervous system. \"Bongarzone is using animal models to inject a virus that carries a replacement gene for the faulty gene in the brain,\" says Alford. \"The process temporarily cures Krabbe disease in ani - mals and holds hope for the future.\" Researchers such as Mary Jo LaDu, PhD, and others in the department are tackling the elusive cure for Alzheimer's disease. LaDu has developed animal models that accelerate degeneration in mice brains, focusing on the properties and interactions between two pro - teins that are genetically, pathologically and biochemically linked to Alzheimer's disease: amyloid- (A) and apolipoprotein E (apoE). The models also provide a testing ground for compounds that may prevent or even reverse the damage and provide insight into the gender-related risk of developing the disease. Other researchers in anatomy and cell biology, such as Sarah Lutz, PhD, and Leon Tai, PhD, are investigating whether inflammation in the blood-brain barrier might be involved in a number of neurodegen - erative diseases of the mind; while Kuei Tseng, MD, PhD, is collabo - rating with colleagues in psychiatry to assess whether cannabinoids modify developmental changes in rat models as they go through adolescence. \"In our department, we're working with a range of disciplines as a bridge between fundamental and clinical science,\" says Alford. Neurology and rehabilitation: Tackling brain disease with big data TO STIMULATE INNOVATIVE RESEARCH and help scientists uncover new cures for diseases like epilepsy, ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) and brain tumors, the neurology and rehabilitation department last year launched the NeuroRepository, a one-of-a-kind human brain tissue bank and research database. Located at the NeuroPsychiatric Institute, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, the NeuroRepository houses tissue specimens linked to clinical, radiological, physiological, histological and molecular/genomic data\u2014\"big data\" that requires advanced computing hardware and software. \"The tissue plus its data set provide a basis for discovery not available through any other regular tissue bank or data warehouse and is available not only to Illinois Medicine researchers, but also to those across the country,\" says Jeffrey Loeb, MD, PhD, John S. Garvin Endowed Chair and head of neurology and rehabilitation. The NeuroRepository has already yielded some transformational insights. \"Using MRI technology, we have a new way to see epilepsy in the human brain by identifying a unique metabolic signature that's associated with the epileptic brain tissue, which causes seizures,\" says Loeb. \"One of the biggest challenges in epilepsy is in diagnosis. With this new biomarker, we should be able to detect very small regions of epileptic activity\u2014smaller than a single square centimeter\u2014and we can do it noninvasively.\" Loeb and his colleagues also have used the NeuroRepository to uncover a new kind of micro- lesion present in epilepsy. \"Using mathematical models, we were able to predict and then confirm the existence of the lesions, which will help us understand why some areas of the brain become epileptic and some don't,\" says Loeb. The department is working to turn newfound knowledge about \"The brain is the most complicated machine of which we are aware on this planet. In the last 30 years, we've discovered more about the brain than mankind had previously learned throughout history, and we're still just scratching the surface.\" \u2014 Simon Alford, department head and the Mary & Raymond Nester Sweeney Professor of Basic SciencesILLINOIS MEDICINE | 19human brain disorders into patient treatments. For example, Michael Carrithers, MD, PhD, and Charles Abrams, MD, PhD, are tackling treatment advances for multiple sclerosis and nerve and muscle diseases. \"We also have a drug in development that we're hoping can slow neurode - generation in ALS,\" says Loeb. \"Fei Song (MD, PhD) is conduct - ing tests in animal models, and we're hoping to take the drug to clinical trials.\" For patients afflicted with brain tumors, the University of Illinois Brain Tumor Center, headed by Kelly Nicholas, MD, PhD, offers treatment that may not be available to patients anywhere else. \"Every patient deserves to be in a clinical trial,\" says Loeb. \"Our drug studies are UIC-specific and are coupled with the highest level of and most compassionate patient care.\" In addition to research and treatment, the neurology department is also working to help patients better understand and monitor diseases, such as epilepsy, through education. Loeb and his colleagues, such as Dilip Pandey, MD, PhD, have pioneered a self-management education program called Personalized Internet-Assisted Underserved Self-management of Epilepsy (PAUSE to Learn About Your Epilepsy). \"Epilepsy is a very complex disease, and some of the roadblocks for patients of different socio-educational backgrounds are lack of accessi - bility to care and information overload,\" says Loeb. \"Through a CDC- funded grant, we are able to send computer tablets home with patients so they can review information on managing their epilepsy at their own pace, even if they don't have Internet access.\" PAUSE is customized in an office visit for each patient's learning needs. Tablets also have a real-time video conferencing capability with an educator to help patients reduce emergency room visits. \"The University of Illinois is the go-to place for patients with complex brain disorders,\" says Loeb. \"We are making discoveries we didn't dream of because we're able to generate and test new hypotheses here, most of which come from our clinical programs, which are second to none.\" Neurosurgery: A data-driven approach to care AS AN IMPORTANT THERAPEUTIC ARM of the neurosciences, Illinois Medicine's internationally known department of neurosurgery provides state-of-the-art technology to patients with acute and severe emergencies such as strokes, aneurysms, brain tumors and head injuries, as well as those suffering from degenerative spinal disease and chronic pain. \"We are one of very few centers in the world that is capable of per - forming certain therapies related to diseases of the blood vessels, such as aneurysms and vascular malformation of the brain,\" says Fady Charbel, MD, department head and the Dr. Richard L. Fruin and Gertrude W. Fruin Professor of Neurosurgery. For example, Charbel collaborated with the university's engineer - ing department to develop the Noninvasive Optimal Vascular Analysis (NOVA), a software program that quantitatively measures blood flow to the brain using standard MRI equipment without any contrast. In a landmark, eight-year, National Institutes of Health- funded, multi-site study called Veritas, for which the COM served as the lead site, NOVA was used to determine which patients are at risk for recurrent stroke in the vertebrobasilar system, which supports the critical functions of the brain stem and cerebellum. \"Prior to Veritas, treatment was determined by a picture of a nar - rowed blood vessel,\" says Charbel. \"Using NOVA, we are able to determine which patients need treatment. Patients who had low blood flow accord - ing to our algorithm had 5.5 times the risk of stroke. We were able to develop precise therapies to suit patient needs.\" To measure blood flow during surgery, Charbel also has developed Flow Assisted Surgical Technol - ogy, a probe that is now part of the lexicon of neurosurgery around the world. Next, the depart - ment is looking to apply the data from Veritas to new therapeutic devices. \"We are working to launch a new clinical trial where we will do everything inside the MRI, treating patients just enough to optimize the blood flow,\" says Charbel. One faculty member actively involved in those clinical trials is Sepideh \"The University of Illinois is the go-to place for patients with complex brain disorders. We are making discoveries we didn't dream of because we're able to generate and test new hypotheses here, most of which come from our clinical programs, which are second to none.\" \u2014 Jeffrey Loeb, John S. Garvin Endowed Chair and head of neurology and rehabilitation \"\"We are one of very few centers in the world that is capable of performing certain therapies related to diseases of the blood vessels, such as aneurysms and vascular malformation of the brain.\" \u2014 Fady Charbel, department head and the Dr. Richard L. Fruin and Gertrude W. Fruin Professor of NeurosurgeryB 20 | SPRING 2018Amin-Hanjani, MD. \"As the department's co-clinical director and residency program director, Sepideh has also been working on guidelines for stroke at a national level,\" says Charbel. In fact, the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System has been designated by The Joint Commission and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association as a Comprehensive Stroke Center, a recognition of its status as an in - dustry leader in setting the national agenda for highly specialized stroke care. Illinois Medicine is also taking a quantitative approach to aneurysms. \"Just as we did with Veritas, we are working with engineering at UIC and other universities, studying the walls of aneurysms to see what makes one more prone to rupture than an - other,\" says Charbel, who has personally treated more than 6,000 aneurysms. \"We then want to investigate what we can develop to help us determine a rupture before it occurs.\" In addition, the department is working on strategies to use magnetically guided nanoparticles that deliver therapeutic agents directly to tumors in the spinal cord, without patients suffering from systemic toxicity. Such work is spearheaded by Ankit Mehta, MD, who also has been screening for depression with spine dis - ease, investigating how it could affect patient outcomes. \"We believe in a data-driven approach to care and are never satisfied with the way things are today,\" says Charbel. \"We can always do better tomorrow.\" Psychiatry: At the forefront of addressing mental health needs ILLINOIS MEDICINE'S DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY is uniquely positioned as the top-ranked NIH-funded department of its kind in the Chicago area to pursue its quest for brain health advancements. And the need has never been greater. According to the National Alliance on Mental Health, approximately one in five adults experiences mental illness in a given year. \"Our Alcohol Research Center, directed by Subhash Pandey [PhD] is the only alcohol center funded by the NIH in Illinois and the only one to focus on epigenetics, the field of molecular science that looks at the connection between environmental stressors and molecular mechanisms of gene expression in the brain,\" says Anand Kumar, MD, department head and Lizzie Gilman Professor of Psychiatry. The department is also using neuroimaging tech - niques, such as functional and structural MRIs, to understand brain function, connectivity and neural networks. For example, K. Luan Phan, MD and Heide Klumpp, PhD, are using the technology to measure brain changes that occur in post-traumatic brain disorders and anxiety, particularly in response to treatment through medication or cog - nitive behavioral therapy. Other physician scientists such as Olusola Ajilore, MD, PhD, and Alex Leow, MD, PhD (see p. 10), are using connectomics, mathematical models to study connectivity in the brain, while Scott Langenecker, PhD, is a cognitive neuroscientist working to understand the mechanisms of depression and mood disorders. To support the estimated 14.8 million U.S. adults affected by depression, the University of Illinois Center for Depression and Resilience (UICDR) was launched in 2014. This multi - disciplinary initiative, modeled after the collaborative approach of the National Cancer Institute, brings together clinicians, edu - cators and researchers in a team science approach to address mental illness and disease. The UICDR is part of the National Network of Depression Centers, a nonprofit research consortium located in 26 sites across the country. \"We are the only NNDC site in Chicago focused on the clinical and research aspects of mood disor - ders,\" says Kumar. The collaborative work of the UICDR is already showing promise. For example, Phan is leading the effort for Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, a noninvasive form of brain stimulation that uses magnetic coils to treat depression. \"RTMS provides another modality for patients who have not responded well to other types of treatment,\" says Kumar. Whether through translational research or clinically, the depart - ment is committed to delivering new mental health strategies and treatments across the human lifespan. For example, the Institute for Juvenile Research, headed by Marc Atkins, PhD, is focused on identifying, preventing and treating behavioral, social or emotional difficulties among children and adolescents. On a national level, the department is aligned with The Kennedy Forum, a public interest organization that fights the stigma of mental illness, but it also has a pervasive local presence. \"We are proud of our strong commitment to improving mental health in underserved communities,\" says Kumar. \"At Illinois Medicine, we have integrated research, patient care and education,\" he says. \"We are in a unique position of training the next generation and are at the cutting edge of conducting research that brings meaningful change into the lives of patients that are often underserved. We're tackling brain health as it's never been done before.\" \"We are in a unique position of training the next generation and are at the cutting edge of conducting research that brings meaningful change into the lives of patients that are often underserved.

The College of Medicine Chicago's department of medical education has long set itself apart by training prominent influencers in a field responsible for developing competent doctors able to function in an ever-evolving health care landscape. By offering graduate and undergraduate programs uniquely designed to enhance the leadership and scholarship skills of health professionals and promote lifelong learning, the college's department of medical education and its co-curricular partners have made a profound impact in shaping many of today's medical education leaders\u2014around the world and close to home.COM excels as an incubator of leaders in medical educationCURRICULAR PROGRAMS CONTINUOUS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EVALUATE ACCREDITATION CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION ACCREDITATION COMMITTEE HEALTHCARE ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS-BASED PRACTICE CLINICIAN EXECUTIVES PHYSICIAN LEADERSby Cheryl SooHooteaching leaders22 | SPRING 2018North of the border \"GOOD DOCTORS AREN'T AUTOMATICALLY good teachers,\" says Salvatore Spadafora, MD, MHPE '01, a graduate of the COM's master of health professions education (MHPE) program designed to develop educational leaders. Currently the vice dean of postgraduate medical education and continuing professional development at the University of Toronto, Spadafora came to this realization as a young anesthesiology resident at the University of Western Ontario in his native Canada. Although his specialty training would prepare him well for clinical practice, he felt his own residency experience cried out for more structure in terms of formal teaching training. \"It could be hit or miss, what you learned,\" he recalls of his time as a trainee. \"While the 'see one, do one, teach one' method is still applicable in medicine, you can also get formal training to become a better teacher and improve on what you see is lacking in medical education.\" With that in mind, Spadafora enrolled in COM's master's program as soon as he completed residency training in 1995. He soon acquired the modern educational methodology tools he was seeking to become a better medical educator. Thinking he would help enhance the education system on a sporadic basis while providing care as a small-town doctor, he quickly found his COM education and the MHPE's global reputation propelling him toward a more influential leadership path. Spadafora started down this road by serving as program director of Western Ontario's anesthesia and family-medicine anesthesia residency programs in 2002 and then, six years later, becoming associate dean of postgraduate medical education for the university's Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry. Today, as a leading medical educator at one of Canada's oldest and most esteemed medical schools, Spadafora oversees the education and training of 3,600 medical residents and fellows. With the added responsibility and oversight of continuing medical education conferences and programs, he also ensures the lifelong education of some 42,000 additional learners attracted to the University of Toronto's CME offerings. Applying his knowledge from the COM to benefit patients in Canada's single-payer system, Spadafora has worked to integrate education in urban and community sites and develop models of interprofessional education. He credits his training at UIC for his upward career trajectory. \"The brand of the master's program gave me instant credibility as a medical educator,\" he says. \"While I worked hard, no doubt my rigorous training afforded me many opportunities that have put me in the position I am in today.\" Ensuring quality education ACHIEVING AND MAINTAINING ACCREDITATION status plays a significant role in motivating medical colleges to meet quality standards. Yet the precise impact of accreditation on the quality of medical education remained relatively amorphous until Danielle Blouin, MD, MHPE '03, PhD '16, professor in the Faculty of Health Sciences and in the Faculty of Education at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, made it the core of her research. The first graduate of COM's collaborative doctoral program in health professions education and curriculum studies with the University of Illinois College of Education, this Canadian emergency medicine physician wrote her thesis on the influence of accreditation processes on the culture of quality improvement in Canadian medical schools. \"There was no scholarly work on the subject when I started my graduate studies in 2013,\" says Blouin, who at the time had just taken a post as assistant secretary of the Committee for the Accreditation of Canadian Medical Schools and the Committee on Accreditation of Continuing Medical Education in Canada. \"It gave me a niche.\" In 2014, Blouin was tapped to head both key organizations charged with ensuring the quality and integrity of medical school programs across Canada via rigorous monitoring and review. In addition to her leadership responsibilities, she continues to build on the research she launched at the COM. \"I am still writing papers based on the novel ideas generated during my PhD studies,\" Blouin says. A globally renowned scholar, she remains focused on program evaluation as it relates to accreditation. Her current work involves defining and assessing markers of quality in medical education to better connect the dots between accreditation status and the ability to educate high-performing future physicians. The Department of Medical Education remains the oldest department in the U.S. dedicated to the study and improvement of medical education. 1959 George E. Miller, MD, founded COM Office of Research in Medical Education (which later became the department of medical education) Danielle Blouin Salvatore Spadafora 2015 Executive Masters of Healthcare Administration (EMHA) program established at UIC ILLINOIS MEDICINE | 23 Blouin remains grateful for the leadership and scholarship skills she honed through the department of medical education's MHPE and PhD programs. \"UIC opened my eyes to new horizons in medical education,\" she says. \"My initial goal was only to become a better teacher, but I soon found myself part of a greater medical education community that I wanted to become more involved in.\" Close to home AFTER 36 YEARS AT THE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE , improving the education of medical students remains energizing for Jorge Girotti, PhD '90, EMHA '17, an assistant professor in the department of medical education, director of the Hispanic Center of Excellence and associate dean for admissions and special curricular programs. After completing the University of Illinois at Chicago's Executive Master of Healthcare Administration program in December 2017, he plans to use this most recent training to enhance education at the COM. \"The program illuminated for me the delivery side of health care and what our graduates face beyond clinical competency, from dealing with health policy issues to organizational and leadership challenges,\" says Girotti. \"It's prompted me to think about what we can do earlier in the educational pipeline to better prepare our students.\" UIC added the EMHA program to its educational offerings in 2015, and at its genesis the program was established as a collaborative effort between the College of Medicine and the School of Public Health to expand leadership and knowledge of the business of health systems. Similar to an executive MBA program, but broader in scope and intention, EMHA integrates the clinical and administrative aspects of managing and working within healthcare organizations. Girotti sees several opportunities to incorporate what he learned into the COM curriculum. For example, as director of the college's Urban Medicine program, Girotti believes students could benefit from a deeper understanding of the socioeconomic forces that influence the ability of urban health systems to address healthcare disparities. \"The EMHA program exposed me to the many challenges that frustrate and discourage practitioners in the delivery of care, especially to the economically disadvantaged,\" says Girotti. \"Tweaks to our curriculum could include the concept and importance of physician leadership in working more effectively within organizations and overcoming obstacles to better serve the underserved.\" Nurturing future physician leaders PREPARING TOMORROW'S PHYSICIANS means educating them for a future of nonstop change. \"The current health care landscape is chaotic at best,\" says Michele Mariscalco, MD, EMHA '16, associate dean for systems-based practice at the COM and assistant vice chancellor for health sciences academic affairs. \"How do we best raise our students to find their place as medical professionals and clinician leaders in a constantly changing health care world?\" To that end, the COM launched the Clinician Executive Medicine program (CEMED) last fall to provide budding physician leaders with the insights required to navigate the complex organizational and health policy changes that often impact delivery of care. A key faculty member of the new four-year program for students in Chicago, Peoria and Rockford, Mariscalco became passionate about instilling business savvy in medical students after her own experience completing the EMHA program. Earning the degree gave her a much greater understanding for the need to nurture clinician leaders at the outset of their medical careers. \"Clinician leadership comes in many forms,\" she says. \"From managing peers in a small group practice to directing a clinical service in a large health enterprise, physicians can't think of themselves as widgets in a big worker wheel. They must learn to take ownership. That's what we can impart to our students early on.\" A seasoned educator, Mariscalco embraced the chance to acquire new knowledge via the EMHA program to enrich her career. In fact, she was one of a half-dozen COM leaders who participated in the program's first cohort of students. \"Lifelong learning always provides additional insights that you can choose to use or expand upon if you need more. It's what education is about, after all.\"The Department of Medical Education remains the oldest department in the U.S. dedicated to the study and improvement of medical education.

The multi-year effort to raise a goal of $280 million for the COM will support scholarships, endowed chairs, faculty research, impassioned medical care, technological innovation and more. Nearly half of the goal, $125 million, the University of Illinois Foundation. \"Philanthropy plays an important role in this pursuit and the achievement of our bold vision for the future of medical education and healthcare.\" Robert Barish, MD, MBA, vice chancellor for health affairs, welcomed the several hundred alumni, faculty, students and friends of the college in attendance. \"UIC, UI Health and the College of Medicine stand on the threshold of great achievement in advanced medical education models, biomedical discovery and community-based patient care,\" he said. \"The work that happens here inspires careers and ignites new futures\u2014for our students and patients alike.\" UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis, PhD, thanked attendees already had been raised by mid-October. \"The campaign for medicine at UIC will firmly distinguish our college among the premier destinations for medical education in the world and elevate our already stellar reputation in research and community- centric healthcare delivery to new heights,\" said Stephanie Grinage, associate vice chancellor for medical advancement and vice president of for coming to \"celebrate the success and impact of the crown jewel of UIC\u2014the College of Medicine\u2014and to start the launching activities of a new university-wide fundraising campaign.\" Amiridis recalled the Greek philosopher Plutarch, who once declared that \"a mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled.\" Added Amiridis, \"Here at UIC, we celebrate the flame inside each one of us; the spark that is determined to reach excellence not bound by circumstance.\" The IGNITE campaign will help UIC and the COM light the spark of their ambitious agendas, Amiridis said.

Researchers at the COM have developed life-saving transplant surgery techniques and HIV drugs, brought national awareness to the hazards of BPA, increased access to healthy foods in urban areas, led the world in high-performance computer visualization and validated the first cure for sickle cell disease, Amiridis said. In process are the development of cures for diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. \"And at the core of our mission is seeking out new ways to reduce and eliminate health disparities,\" he said. Gala attendees all had their own reasons for supporting the College of Medicine and feeling their flames lit by its mission. For Bruno Pasquinelli, a Root Society donor, the spark was kindled after he needed a doctor and was referred to UI Health. \"They have probably the best doctors in the world here,\" he said. \"The doctors here have a passion.\" He gives to the school and urges others to do so, to support faculty research in areas like robotic surgery. Alumna Eslyn Garb, Pharm '81, MD '87, built her bond with an institution that has a deep commitment to admit people of all ethnic groups and socioeconomic statuses. \"They took me in. I was not rich. I was hard-working,\" she said. \"They educated me, and I am grateful.\" She has given to the COM's scholarship fund and plans to give more \"when the time comes.\" Rosa Berardi, program officer at The Coleman Foundation, said the COM is one of 10 medical centers in a collaborative her institution funds that's looking at redesigning the process and reformulating the services provided to those who have recently received the devastating diagnosis that they have cancer. Coleman has provided support for the psychosocial aspects of oncology for the past 25 years and has been promulgating principles and ideas aligned with recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine, Berardi said. \"It's a process improvement project to look at how services are delivered,\" she said. \"University of Illinois [COM] is putting these processes in place.\" Student Drew Ormseth, who serves as student alumni representative, said he and his classmates found the Gala to be an outstanding opportunity to meet and hear from alumni, which had taken him away from the day-to-day grind of medical school and reminded him what ignited his spark to attend the COM. \"In medical school, you can fall into a hole of studying and lose track of why you wanted to come in the first place,\" he said. \"The videos they showed were very inspirational and reminded me why I wanted to go into medicine. Getting this alumni-to-student interaction is huge. These people are all mentors to us. This opportunity is just unbelievable.\" Student Anna Brzezinski, a member of the Innovation Medicine Program, expressed her gratitude toward the COM's supporters and admiration for Illinois Medicine awardees. \"The people we will honor tonight demonstrate the iconic qualities of our college and the impact that each of us can have on the future of medicine,\" she said.

Wasile was a nurse and had four children before she started medical school at the COM; she also has experience in the Army Nurse Corps and the Air Force Medical Corps. \"I've been kind of busy,\" said Wasile, who is also a grandmother, with a smile. While walking through the College of Medicine's West Tower en route to an Illinois Med Talk presentation, she said the medical buildings and facilities are \"a lot brighter than they were. They are bright and modern.\" Stephen Aprill, MD '67 , a longtime specialist in internal medicine and oncology in Washington state who now lives in Santa Monica, California, attended the event with his sister and daughter. Aprill reflected on his time at the COM and noted how it has changed. \"The school did well by me,\" Aprill said. \"Now I am struck by the facilities and the growth of this place,\" he added, noting that UI Health, the university's hospital, hadn't even opened when he graduated from medical school. \"It's really amazing.\" Ethelyn Williams-Neal, MD '67 , is a pediatrician in Memphis who also teaches in clinical environments at Methodist Hospitals of Memphis. Moments before the Illinois Med Talk presentations during the reunion, she marveled at a classroom with more than a dozen large LCD screens that broadcast educational content\u2014an example of advanced technology that has become an integral part of how today's students learn. \"I have fond memories of UIC, and the medical education I got here has served me well,\" Williams-Neal said, adding that she was also pleased to see \"how diverse the school is these days.\" Williams-Neal, who has devoted much of her career to serving children in the Memphis area, also noted the emphasis the COM places on serving underserved communities and the belief that health care is for all. \"I've been in this field for 50 years now,\" she said, \"and I still strongly believe that health care should be a right.\" 26 | SPRING 2018 by Dan Baronreunion REUNION 2017: Alumni Reminisce, Reflect on COM's Evolution Aillinois med talks ILLINOIS MEDICINE | 27 Illinois Med Talks Rekindle Lifelong Learning ILLINOIS MED TALKS FEATURED CURRENT COM FACULTY as they showcased the inspired education and innovative approaches to clinical care that continue to happen on campus. The presentations held on October 13 provided insight into applications of modern technology to novel therapies in ophthalmology and surgery, in addition to the new model of medical education and its application to the COM's curricular update. Reflections on retinal research Jennifer Lim, MD, director of retina service at UI Health, delivered the Sweeney Society of Distinguished Faculty Presentation and shared visuals that demonstrated how she has worked to halt the impact of age-related macular degeneration and various other potentially blinding retinal diseases and to improve visual acuity. She emphasized her career-long goals of \"restoring vision, inspiring learning and passing on knowledge.\" Lim related the story of one patient who gained measurable eyesight after she provided him with a retinal implant that allowed the once legally blind man to see shapes and light. \"I remember this patient said to a grandchild, 'It's nice to see that you're pretty tall,'\" she said. Reflecting on her career thus far, she exclaimed, \"It's been a great ride.\" Active learning in medical education Raymond Curry, MD, senior associate dean for educational affairs, talked about how the new Illinois Medicine curriculum reflects several trends in medical education, including a greater emphasis on team-based active learning, a longitudinal, developmental approach to student assessment, and the integration of clinical perspectives and experience throughout medical school. A professor of medicine and medical education, Curry also discussed the different types of courses students will take, including a new format of block courses, and courses that focus on wellness and resilience (see p. 12). John Groth, MD, assistant professor of clinical pathology, augmented Curry's thoughts by noting how the new curriculum has been constructed to be \"more focused and less redundant.\" In the end, he said, \"We want to help create critical thinkers. Curriculum change is really about active learning.\" Advances in robotic surgery Pier Giulianotti, MD, a pioneer in the field, delivered a passionate presentation on the growing potential of robotics in general surgery. Researchers at the COM can \"go beyond our limits,\" said Giulianotti, chief of the division of general, minimally invasive and robotic surgery at UI Health, who has performed more than 3,000 minimally invasive surgeries and 2,000 robot-assisted surgeries. During his presentation, he emphasized the precision of robotic surgery and described how robotic surgery has an increasing array of potential applications for surgeries on the pancreas, liver, kidneys and many other organs. \"Supporting the development of robotics surgery is a cultural investment,\" said Giulianotti, who serves as honorary president of the Clinical Robotic Surgery Association. \"It's really about achieving what we wouldn't be able to do otherwise.\" Jennifer Lim Raymond Curry Pier Giulianotti28 | SPRING 2018pioneer in medicine award by Richard Asa A TRUE PIONEER IN THE CURE FOR CANCER pioneer in medicineG Emil J Freireich '47, MD '49pioneer in medicineGGROWING UP IN CHICAGO'S HUMBOLDT PARK neighborhood offered plenty of struggles and challenges for Emil J Freireich, but it also built resilience. Through persistence and dedication to his education, Freireich persevered to become one of the pioneers of cancer treatment at a time when the multi-drug approach he took was ridiculed, and even condemned. For all of the groundbreaking research he conducted and treatment he provided, Freireich '47, MD '49, was honored with the 2017 Pioneer in Medicine award at the Illinois Medicine Gala in October (see p. 24). The son of Hungarian immigrants who ran a restaurant but lost it to the Great Depression, Freireich was just 2 when his father died. He rarely saw his mother, who worked grueling hours at a millinery workshop. \"When you grow up on the streets, all you want to do is survive,\" he says. Freireich was a diligent student, however, and he even graduated high school a year early. He hadn't thought past a career as a typist or secretary until a physics teacher encouraged him to attend the University of Illinois. After completing his bachelor's degree, he returned to Chicago to attend medical school at the COM, as part of a class of 188 students at a time when only few applicants were admitted. \"The College of Medicine was the most exciting period of my life,\" Freireich says. \"I did very well in the basic sciences, and when I got to the clinical sciences, I really enjoyed it.\" As a medical student, he pursued a rotation at Cook County Hospital, adjacent to the medical school. Freireich's first rotation was with tuberculosis patients, at a time when the disease was rampant. He then rotated to infectious disease. He says both were \"horrible\" for the impact they had on patients. Freireich's training continued at Presbyterian Hospital, where he became the chief resident. That was where he met his wife, Haroldine, who was the head nurse at the time. After his formal training, Freireich's path took him to Boston College, where he published a significant paper early in his career, and then he was hired by the National Cancer Institute in Washington, where he was tasked with \"finding a cure for leukemia.\" By then, he had treated leukemia and was well-versed in drugs that were being used. In 1955, there were three drugs shown to induce temporary remissions in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A fourth was added a few years later. From day one at the cancer institute, Freireich was in charge of a ward full of children who had leukemia. He soon observed that the greatest obstacle to successful treatment was hemorrhage. The disease produced horrific symptoms at that time; kids would bleed from their ears, mouth and nose. Desperate parents were willing to try new treatments. Freireich began to concentrate on how to stop the hemorrhaging and noted a direct relationship between the concentration of platelets and the possibility of bleeding. The higher the platelet count, the more likely there would be active bleeding. \"Platelets were obviously important,\" Freireich says. He and others published a paper on that subject. \"It's a citation classic.\" By 1958, Freireich and colleagues proved they could cure childhood leukemia in many cases by combining four drugs. But this development wasn't without controversy. Prominent researchers at the time discredited the approach, particularly because children got sicker from the drugs' side effects before they got better. The grit Freireich developed in childhood served him well. Eventually his critics would come to understand the benefits of this treatment. And today, the therapies he developed for cancer treatment are standard practice. By the mid-1960s, Freireich was enticed to join the nascent MD Anderson Cancer Center, which at the time was a tertiary hospital with 100 beds and no research facility. He was at first hesitant to leave the well-established National Cancer Institute. But once he and a handful of prominent researchers came to Houston, the center was on its way to becoming a top cancer treatment and research mecca in the U.S. Today, nearly all successful cancer chemotherapy follows his approach of multiple drugs being used together. At 91, Freireich looks back on the roots of his medical career with fondness and gratitude. \"Well, I don't have any comparison. I only went to one school,\" he says. \"But the University of Illinois has created a whole generation of scholars in all the disciplines. I mean it's just a great institution, a public institution that has transformed the nation in a way. Every state has institutions that do that. But Illinois is a star in my universe. \"It made me a doctor,\" he adds. \"I could have gone to a hundred medical schools, probably, and I don't know if the result would be the same. But my experiences at County and Presbyterian made me the investigator who went to Washington to cure leukemia. \"They transformed me from a typist to a physician who has cured patients with cancer. What else can a university expect? That's great.\" Freireich saw his last patients in 2015, but he continues to work on research to advance cancer treatment including stem cell transplantation and maintains contact with doctors and trainees on the staff. Freireich is modest about the Pioneer in Medicine award, saying that he is grateful, but that he believes the College's importance to the community and the state outweighs any individual recognition he could achieve. \"Being a pioneer in anything is a real honor,\" Freireich says. \"It means that you have the ability to break through the darkness and create light. And what the medical school does is gives you the tools to peek into the darkness and to discover new things.\" His message to prospective students? Medicine is humanity's \"highest calling. If you can become a physician, you have the privilege of extending life and relieving pain and suffering. And that's a very high calling,\" Freireich says. \"I'm excited to be a physician, and I think that academic medical communities are a major part of the culture of any advanced society.\" ILLINOIS MEDICINE | 29Emil J Freireich '47, MD '49illinois medicine awards30 | SPRING 2018 AWARD AWARD BUILDING SIDE BY SIDE HE LATE JAMES \"DOC\" GRANT '52, MD '54, and his wife, Marion, spent their lives finding new and better ways to help those in need. Their legacy continues to fuel the passion of today's students by supporting the mission of the College of Medicine and student achievement. \"He embodied the Spirit of Medicine Award with his diligent practice and his unending concern for and devotion to patients,\" Marion Grant says of her late husband. \"He helped them, healed them and gave them hope.\" After serving as a Marine in World War II, James Grant completed an engineering degree at the Urbana campus of the University of Illinois before starting a construction company. A few years later, he went on to pursue a career in medicine and never looked back. At the College of Medicine, Grant's ability to communicate across disciplines helped the hospital's physicians work with engineers to develop its first heart-lung machine in 1952. His diverse background, combined with an entrepreneurial spirit, continued to enable Grant to build successful businesses throughout his career. After graduation, the Arizona native left the chill of Chicago winters for sunny San Diego where he opened the Pacific Beach Medical Clinic in 1956. Grant met and married Marion, who has a background in education. By 1975, the couple sold his family-medicine practice in San Diego and moved to Newport Beach, California, where Marion served as a high school principal. James then opened yet another successful family medicine practice in nearby Irvine, which the couple sold in 1985. With still more to accomplish and much too restless to retire, the Grants began looking for their next venture. In 1990, when James Grant was 70, they opened the country's first two private, free-standing plasma centers in Texas. In addition to being one of the largest plasma centers in the country at the time, Austin-Bio-Med Lab Inc. transformed the industry by shipping plasma worldwide. Although James Grant passed away in 2016 at the age of 96, Marion continues his legacy by supporting students and medical education through philanthropic gifts. FIGURING OUT FIBROMYALGIA RUCE GILLIS '69, MD '74, MPH, credits his mother for pointing him on the path to become a physician: She wanted her son to be a doctor. He became that and much more as a research scientist, innovator and entrepreneur. Honored with the 2017 Innovator of Today Award, Gillis founded Los Angeles-based EpicGenetics Laboratory Inc. in 2013, a biomedical company that developed a conclusive fibromyalgia blood screening tool, the FM/a \u00ae Test. Used worldwide, the test identifies immune system biomarkers unique to the disease. Always intellectually curious, Gillis finished his medical studies at the College of Medicine in just three years, which allowed him to spend an elective fourth year earning a master's in public health at Harvard University, graduating from both institutions in 1974. As a student at the college, he recalls a faculty member predicting that his schooling would only supply him with about 10 percent of his medical knowledge. Reflecting, he says that \"science has changed drastically over my career.\" After medical school, he completed two medical residencies and two fellowships before embarking on a career that has seen him use his entrepreneurial skills to start his own laboratory and hold a prestigious faculty position at the University of California at Los Angeles. Gillis never thought he would be a prototypical physician. He started out in academics and then began investigating disease processes that were still being evaluated. \"I went into medicine to make a difference in the well-being of others and to advance science,\" he says. \"For years, fibromyalgia was dismissed by the medical community as a bogus affliction. But I'm willing to poke and prod into regions that not only have been ignored, but also looked down upon. Our breakthrough has proven that this disease, which affects 6 percent of the world's population, is real.\" James and Marion Grant Bruce GillisSPIRIT OF MEDICINE INNOVATOR OF TODAY B Tillinois medicine awards by Carla Beecherillinois medicine awards AWARD AWARD LEADER IN PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES ANET LIN, MD '99, MPH '04, has orchestrated multidisciplinary teams of nurses, public health professionals, physicians, business leaders, engineers and others to effect change on a global scale in areas ranging from HIV diagnosis to natural disaster field work. In recognition of her innovation and drive, she received the 2017 College of Medicine Emerging Innovator Award. As an associate professor of emergency medicine, director of health systems development in the Center for Global Health, and an affiliate associate professor of community health sciences in the UIC School of Public Health, Lin has combined her interests to tackle societal medical problems. Her insightfulness has pioneered a way to identify HIV during emergency room exams. And her innovative approach to natural-disaster field work in other countries has given caregivers worldwide new ways to bridge health disparities. Until recently, Lin served as director of the International Emergency Medicine and Global Health Fellowship at UIC, a post she held for 11 years. During that time, she worked extensively in Latin America, Africa and Asia to increase access to quality health care in areas with limited resources. Her ability to coordinate people, organizations and resources helped create a disaster-risk re-education training program for the people of Haiti, who have been affected by hurricanes and earthquakes. Closer to home, Lin serves as the principal investigator of a program, Project HEAL, that works to increase HIV and hepatitis C vaccination education, awareness, testing and linkage to care. \"What she's done with HIV screening in the emergency department is remarkable. It's identified many people who did not know they were HIV positive. Their lives will forever be affected in a very empowering way,\" says Terry Vanden Hoek, MD, head of the department of emergency medicine. Lin received the University's Excellence in Teaching Award in 2013 and served as chair of the International Section of the American College of Emergency Physicians. She is currently the secretary/treasurer of the Illinois Chapter of the College of Emergency Physicians.A PUBLIC FACE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INCERE, KNOWLEDGEABLE AND AMBITIOUS, 2017 Distinguished Alumnus honoree Terry Mason, MD '78, who now leads the Cook County Department of Public Health, became a doctor to address the health challenges of African-Americans. The \"death rates were higher and every indicator was worse,\" he says. \"So I became a physician to improve those numbers.\" After completing residencies in general surgery and urology and working in private practice for a time, Mason began hosting \"Doctor in the House\" for Chicago's WVON-FM in 1992. Believing that food was the most important driver of disease prevention, he founded the Center for New Life in 1994 to treat chronic diseases with diet modification and exercise. \"We could put a clinic on every corner in America, but it wouldn't make much difference in outcomes,\" Mason says. \"Stroke, obesity and cancer are all driven by eating the right or the wrong foods.\" Ten years later, he launched Restart4Health, a weekly program that met at various Chicago locations to provide information and support that encouraged Chicagoans to adopt healthy eating and lifestyle habits. With a community-outreach background and a public voice from his radio show, he was tapped by Mayor Richard M. Daley in 2005 to become commissioner of the City of Chicago Department of Public Health, a role where he oversaw the city's food protection, environmental permitting, immunization, and prevention efforts for communicable diseases. With more than 1,200 employees and an annual budget of $200 million, Mason's department also studied the root causes of community health issues, including poverty, housing and transportation. Four years later he assumed the role of chief medical officer and chief operating officer for the Cook County Department of Public Health, a post he holds today. \"With a solid understanding of both the clinical delivery and the public health sides of health care, Dr. Mason has been the best choice for these important roles,\" says Jay Noren, MD, MPH, associate dean for leadership development.

Designed to connect current medical students who are pursuing residency interviews across the country with COM alumni who live near students' potential destinations, the HOST Program is celebrating another successful year of pairing students with alumni hosts who provided accommodations to visiting students, or insight into the programs with which they may be interviewing. Chien was moved to give back to the College of Medicine, and the HOST Program offered a unique way to stay connected and meet current medical students. He notes that although he interacts with medical students in his current position, the HOST Program \"gave some insight and allowed me to see various perspectives of medical students I would not otherwise be able to get in my current job.\" His wife, Kathleen Chien, BSN '86, helps with the hosting duties when students visit them in Cleveland. Having hosted three students in the past two years, they first connected with then-student Vanessa Nienhouse to talk about Cleveland-area programs and met for dinner when she visited for her residency interview. This past year, the couple hosted two students, Rachel Payne and Ashley Patel, which eased the burden of their costly interview processes. The Chiens try to offer a homestay that fits the needs of the student guests, and they offer the flexibility and insight needed during the busy interview season. \"My wife usually greets them, and they often head out to the pre-interview dinner, meet and greet,\" Chien notes. \"We get to speak with them when they get back and make sure that we have what they need for the next day. This year our student and another interviewee from another program went to dinner with us. We had a great conversation!\" Looking forward, Chien plans to continue to participate as an alumni host. He says, \"It keeps me grounded and it's an important way to give back to the institution.\" Edward and Kathleen Chien Get involved with the COM Ambassador Network today!

A NEONATOLOGY PIONEER Alvin Miller '51, MD '53, spent more than 60 years as a pediatrician in the Los Angeles area, setting a high bar for energy and longevity while emerging a trusted expert in neonatal care. Miller began his career as a pediatric physician at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Panorama City, California. Sparked by the premature birth and respiratory distress of his own son, Miller became particularly attentive to the treatment of premature babies and helped to establish the neonatal intensive care unit at Kaiser Panorama City. Other Los Angeles area hospitals soon turned to him for help caring for their premature newborns and, later, as a resource to help establish their own NICUs. Eventually, Miller took his expertise abroad. He traveled to Romania in 1991 to teach perinatal and neonatal care to clinicians in a country seeking stability after the fall of communism. That experience led Miller to develop Project NEWSTART, which has provided comprehensive neonatal care instruction to healthcare workers throughout Eastern Europe. For that work, Miller was awarded the University of Illinois Alumni Humanitarian Award in 2012. After 38 years with Kaiser, Miller bypassed retirement and ventured into private practice before Simi Valley Hospital in Simi Valley, California, recruited him to spearhead the creation of its NICU in 2008. Miller, then in his early 80s, served as the unit's first medical director. \"I don't have money to buy a hospital, so giving of my knowledge is what I do,\" Miller said of his commitment to educating others. A Renaissance man whose initial email address started with \"hyperAl,\" Miller also played the violin and was a founding member of the Los Angeles Doctors Symphony Orchestra. \"Dr. Al,\" as many knew him, also devoted his summers to Camp Hess Kramer in Malibu, California, where he served as camp physician. \u2014 Daniel Smith Alvin Miller '56'59'61 Donald Funk Norman HalfpennyFOUNDING DIRECTOR OF COM NEURO- PSYCHIATRIC UNIT Moises Gaviria, MD, enjoyed a groundbreaking, three-decades- long academic career at the College of Medicine, where he established the first affective disorder clinic at the Chicago campus and served as its founding director, and he led the fellowship program in neuropsychiatry. Gaviria was a \"consummate clinician and educator,\" says Henry W. Dove, MD, professor of clinical psychiatry and associate dean for graduate medical education at the COM Chicago. \"He taught and mentored a generation of students, residents and fellows, building bridges that they too might cross with confidence and ease,\" Dove says. A founder of the International Neuropsychiatric Association, Gaviria taught locally, nationally and internationally. He worked with the Peruvian American Medical Society and numerous other organizations to enhance mental health care and education across Latin America. He was also a prolific researcher and writer, publishing more than 150 papers and co-authoring four textbooks. Gaviria was born in 1943 in Chiclayo, Peru, and attended medical school at National San Marcos University in Lima before completing his residency at the University of Connecticut and a fellowship at the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute. After retiring from the University of Illinois in 2004, he was named a Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry. Gaviria continued to teach and see patients as a member of the department of psychiatry at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Illinois, and in 2014 he moved to private practice. At the time of his death he was a faculty member at the Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood. Gaviria loved international travel with his family, spicy food, symphony concerts and The New York Times. Gaviria passed away on Sept. 9, 2017, surrounded by family and friends, due to complications of brain cancer.

Call the Office of Medical Advancement (312) 996-4470 . Innovative It all starts with a single sparkJoe Geraghty, MD/PhD student and president of the Chicago Medical Student Council , talked to Illinois Medicine about what brought him here, his work in the lab of Jeffrey Loeb and Fernando Testai in the UI NeuroRepository, and his experience this year as student council president. What motivated you to attend medical school and to apply for the MD/PhD program at the COM? Growing up, I always knew I wanted to be a doctor, and I wanted to teach. As an undergraduate at SUNY Geneseo, I did research in an organic chemistry lab, synthesizing organic compounds that had different medicinal applications. It was my first opportunity to fall in love with science for the sake of science. When I visited the College of Medicine, it seemed like the program was really invested in recruiting applicants. I was encouraged by the sense of collaboration I saw. I knew it would be supportive and allow me to excel. What got you interested in neurosciences, and what has your work in Dr. Loeb's lab and the NeuroRepository involved? Neurological diseases are so debilitating. During my second year of medical school, I met with Dr. Loeb and was immediately impressed by his enthusiasm and passion, and how his research translates to the diseases that affect his patients. Our lab studies a broad range of neurological diseases, from epilepsy, to ALS, to stroke. For my thesis project, I'm studying the role of neuroinflammation in long-term impairments after a particular type of stroke called subarachnoid hemorrhage, which occurs when aneurysms in the brain rupture. We are looking at seizure activity and cognitive dysfunction, as well as testing immunomodulatory therapies to prevent these impairments. The UI NeuroRepository has been a great addition to our lab's research program, as we now have access to a tremendous amount of patient data, including both tissue and clinical data from patients with epilepsy, stroke and ALS. What are your priorities as president of the Chicago Medical Student Council? I've been able to help establish an organization known as the Student Curricular Board, a unique collaboration between student government and the Office of Curricular Affairs. I have been advocating for my peers, bringing issues regarding curriculum and student services to the attention of the administration. My central goal this year has been to take these issues and synthesize them in a solutions-oriented fashion\u2014like through \"Dialogues with the Deans\" events. We have created several brand-new committees on topics like wellness and resilience, diversity and inclusion, and preparation for licensing exams. How has the revived focus on the student in the revamped curriculum improved your experience and that of your classmates? I am thrilled with the new medical curriculum (see p. 4). The integrated, systems-based approach they're taking is going a long way. Ultimately, that's what you need to do as a third- and fourth- year medical student: When someone comes in with swelling in their limbs, it's not just one organ in the body that's potentially the culprit. The other thing that's really unique is the addition of medical colloquia and synthesis, which allows students a degree of individualization in their learning that cultivates their interests and passions. What makes you most proud to be a COM medical student? My answer is pretty much the same every time I get this question: It's really the people. The people here are really outstanding. There's a strong sense of community, and a strong sense of collaboration. When I interviewed here, I knew I was going to learn, grow, and be surrounded by inspiring peers and mentors who would push me to my greatest potential.
