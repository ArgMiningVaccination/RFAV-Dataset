Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) Schwab offers multiple types of individual retirement accounts (IRAs) to help meet your retirement goals. What is an Individual Retirement Account? Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are personal retirement savings accounts that offer tax benefits and a range of investment options. Many investors use IRAs as their common source of saving for retirement. Even those with access to employer-sponsored plans, such as a 401(k) or 403(b), still tap into IRA tax advantages to boost their savings and add flexibility to their portfolio. Types of IRAs Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and Rollover IRAs are the three most commonly chosen individual retirement options. Variations of common IRA types include Inherited IRAs and Custodial IRAs. Each IRA has its own characteristics to evaluate when setting your retirement savings goals. - Traditional IRA - Contributions may be tax deductible.

Common questions - - For a Traditional IRA, you can contribute up to $6,000 for the tax year 2022 and $6,500 for the tax year 2023, or up to 100% of earned income, whichever is less. Individuals aged 50 and over can also make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution from earned income for tax years 2022 and 2023. Roth IRAs have the same contribution limits but also have income eligibility requirements. Not all of your IRA contributions may be eligible for a current-year tax deduction. See [Traditional IRA contribution limits](https://www.schwab.com/ira/traditional-ira/contribution-limits)and [Roth IRA contribution limits](https://www.schwab.com/ira/roth-ira/contribution-limits). - - You can withdraw the excess contribution amount, but you will be charged a 6% penalty each year that money remains in your account. When you withdraw your funds, you'll need to file [IRS Form 5329](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5329.pdf). Note: Depending on your age, you could be taxed twice on your withdrawal. To determine the best solution for your situation, contact your tax advisor. - - You can remove the extra funds after the tax filing deadline (including extensions), but you will be charged a 6% penalty. Note: The IRS has yet to provide a definitive answer on whether earnings from these funds must also be removed after the tax filing deadline. Check with a tax advisor to determine the best solution for your individual situation. - - You can't take a loan from your IRA. However, you may be eligible to make an indirect rollover from your IRA (Traditional or Roth) once in a 12-month period without penalty if you replace the funds within 60 days. If you don't pay back the distribution within 60 days, you may be subject to taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty. For Roth IRAs, you can take a distribution of contributions without penalty, but any earnings may be subject to taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty. - - Before you reach age 59\u00bd, you are subject to a 10% penalty, in addition to federal and state taxes, on Traditional IRA distributions and earnings withdrawals from Roth IRAs. Roth IRA contributions can be withdrawn at any time without penalty. If IRS requirements are met, distributions from Traditional IRAs and Roth [earnings are penalty-free under certain circumstances](https://www.schwab.com/ira/traditional-ira/withdrawal-rules/59-and-over). - - Your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is used to determine whether you are qualified for certain tax benefits, such as how much of your IRA contribution is deductible. Your MAGI is calculated by taking your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and adding certain items, such as foreign income or higher education tuition. The resulting number will dictate your IRA contribution deductibility. - - With a Schwab IRA, you can choose from a wide range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, CDs, ETFs, and mutual funds.
