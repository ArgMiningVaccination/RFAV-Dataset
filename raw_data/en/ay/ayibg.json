Of those, twenty-one specify requirements for healthcare workers, and the majority of those states require vaccination or regular testing of unvaccinated employees. Six states have taken a \"vaccinate or terminate\" approach, only permitting healthcare workers to be unvaccinated if they have a valid religion or medical exemption as defined for by the EEOC. Thirteen states have passed laws that ban employers from mandating vaccines for workers; three more states are expected to enact such bans in the near future. Three states (Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina) are rumored to be working on vaccine mandates for state workers, but these mandates have not yet materialized. Below, we break down, by type and [by](https://www.colorado.gov/governor/news/6036-governor-polis-urges-state-board-health-engage-expedited-rulemaking-require-covid-19) requirement specification, which states have put forth mandates or bans and under what circumstances. Also, we highlight some interesting caveats that states have put forth within their mandate or ban. Hyperlinks are included for reference and further reading. As this is subject to rapid change, information written below is valid as of today's posting date: February 9, 2022.

However, they must provide \"reasonable accommodation\" for any who are unvaccinated. \u00b7 [Arkansas](https://legiscan.com/AR/bill/HB1547/2021)*: Ban scope is only state entities; does not address private sector employers. \u00b7 [Florida](https://www.flgov.com/2021/11/18/governor-ron-desantis-signs-legislation-to-protect-florida-jobs/): Ban scope includes ALL private and public employers, and employers who violate the ban face a $10,000 per employee violation fine. \u00b7 [Georgia](https://gov.georgia.gov/document/2021-executive-order/05252101/download)*: Ban scope is only state entities; does not address private sector employers. \u00b7 [Idaho](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/06/1043788284/idahos-lieutenant-governor-banned-vaccine-mandates-while-gov-little-was-out-of-t): Ban scope is only state entities; does not address private sector employers. \u00b7 [Indiana](https://legiscan.com/IN/text/HB1405/id/2379961)*: Ban scope is only state entities; does not address private sector employers. \u00b7 [Kansas](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/kansas-governor-signs-bill-limiting-workplace-vaccine-mandates): Ban scope includes ALL private and public employers. \u00b7 [Montana](https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2021/billpdf/HB0702.pdf): Ban applies to all employers except healthcare. Healthcare institutions are permitted to ask employees to voluntarily share their status, and may assume that anyone who does not share their status is unvaccinated. However, they must provide \"reasonable accommodation\" for any who are unvaccinated. \u00b7 [New Hampshire](https://www.nashp.org/state-lawmakers-submit-bills-to-ban-employer-vaccine-mandates/)*: Generally bans the mandate of vaccines as condition of employment unless a \"direct threat\" exists (see link for definition) that cannot be addressed by other means or reasonable accommodation \u00b7 [North Dakota](https://www.nashp.org/state-lawmakers-submit-bills-to-ban-employer-vaccine-mandates/)*: Ban scope is only state entities; does not address private sector employers. \u00b7 [Tennessee](https://www.nashp.org/state-lawmakers-submit-bills-to-ban-employer-vaccine-mandates/)*: Ban scope is only state entities; does not address private sector employers. \u00b7 [Texas](https://www.nashp.org/state-lawmakers-submit-bills-to-ban-employer-vaccine-mandates/): Ban scope includes ALL private and public employers. \u00b7 [Utah](https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HB0308.html)*: Ban scope is only state entities; does not address private sector employers. Interesting Caveats: \u00b7 Arizona: Requires \"reasonable accommodation\" for unvaccinated staff in all settings, and bans vaccine passports. \u00b7 Connecticut: Employer may not hire unvaccinated staff or volunteers. \u00b7 Kentucky: Suggestion, not really a mandate; twice a week testing. \u00b7 Montana: General ban, except that healthcare employers are permitted to ask employees to voluntarily share their vaccination status for the purposes of reasonable accommodation only. Also bans vaccine passports. \u00b7 New York: Only requires ONE dose by deadline for healthcare workers. \u00b7 Oregon: Stipulates that vaccination is by deadline OR six weeks following full FDA approval, whichever date is LATER. \u00b7 Pennsylvania: All new hires must be vaccinated prior to starting to work.
