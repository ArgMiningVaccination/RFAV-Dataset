Doctors who practice it use some amount of natural substances like plants and minerals to stimulate the healing process. They believe that the body does not need healing for only a particular symptom, but the individual as a whole. Homeopathic treatment works in harmony with the immune system of an individual. The World Health Organization recognizes homeopathy as the second-largest therapeutic system in the world. Millions of people are using it worldwide for more than 200 years. First, it was developed in Germany in the late 1700s. It later got popular in European countries. Today, homeopathy is getting rapid popularity in the United States as well. How Does Homeopathy Work? Homeopathic remedies are made up of minerals, plants, animals, and other natural products. To make it, homeopathic experts need to crush the relevant natural substances and dissolve them in grain, alcohol, or lactose to weaken the ingredients. Afterward, they shake the mixture mechanically and store it as a part of the potentization process. Homeopathic doctors try to dilute it as much as they can since they believe the more diluted the substance, the lower the dose, and hence, the higher the effectiveness of healing. Additionally, they believe that when they shake homeopathic remedies with water in glass bottles, the silicon particles of glass mix in the remedy and work to preserve its unique properties.

A person's physical state often called the constitution includes relative qualities of concentration, creativity, vitality, initiative, persistence, sensitivities, strength, and stamina. To provide the right remedy for a condition, a homeopath considers all of these aspects. It allows each diagnosis and remedy to get individualized. It means the three individuals having the same symptoms, may need three different homeopathy prescriptions. For that, a homeopath asks the patient several questions about their physical, emotional, and [mental health](https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health) and then prescribes the best suitable homeopathic remedies to them.
