Whether you shop online or in a store, you were likely faced with a lot of options. So, how did you choose? Maybe it was a new fresh scent that caught your attention. Or the allure of softer, younger looking skin. Perhaps it was the comfort of a familiar brand. Or the gratification of finding a great deal. Was it something on the ingredient list that sold you on the product? Or, better yet, something that wasn't? [Begin your sustainability journey with the Ecologic 16oz reusable sprayer and pump eco.bottle 4pk kit!](https://go.jabil.com/l/700973/2022-04-19/l9jl3) Body washes, like so many everyday personal care products, can contain dozens of chemicals - many of which can be linked to health concerns including hormone disruptions and increased risk of cancer. Common chemicals in body washes include: [Formaldehyde](https://www.bcpp.org/resource/organic-solvents/): a known carcinogen which can be added to act as a preservative in many personal care and cleaning products. [Triclosan](https://www.bcpp.org/resource/triclosan/): a hormone disruptor, used as an antimicrobial agent to prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria. [Parabens](https://www.bcpp.org/resource/parabens/): chemicals that prevent the growth of mold and bacteria and are added to body wash to stabilize the product and extend its shelf life. [Ethoxylated ingredients](https://www.bcpp.org/resource/ethylene-oxide/): these chemicals are intended to make skincare products less harsh, however can also be linked to cancer. Ingredients that end in 'eth' have been ethoxylated. Conscious consumers look out for these ingredients on product labels. However, some of the chemicals found in body washes may not be listed on the label at all. In fact, the word \" [fragrance](https://www.bcpp.org/resource/fragrance/)\" on an ingredient list is a generic label that can actually hide dozens or more potentially harmful chemicals. Now before you swear off body wash for good, we have good news for you. You can create your own body wash with simple ingredients that's just as effective and refreshing as the store-bought versions.
