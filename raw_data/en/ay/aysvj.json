Dr. Z's Story Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, \"Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?\" Then I said, \"Here am I. Send me!\" He said, \"Go, and tell this people . . .\" ~ ISAIAH 6:8-9 Affectionately known as \"Dr. Z\", Dr. Eric Zielinski is on a mission to helping people experience the abundant life. Dr. Z has always been that guy to step up and do what needed to be done. In [The Healing Power of Essential Oils](https://naturallivingfamily.com/healing-power-essential-oils-book/), Dr. Z reminiscences, \"I can remember being a kid and helping my elderly neighbors by shoveling their snow, not because my parents forced me, but because I wanted to. It made me feel good. And it still does. If I see a need, I try my best to fill it, especially when it involves people. When I became a Christian, this part of me got amplified. Early on, I stumbled upon Isaiah 6:8-9 and I remember raising my hands in prayer, mimicking the prophet's words: \"Here I am, Lord, send me!\" I cried out, \"I don't care what it is, I just want to do my part!\" That prayer has proven to be the impetus for my biblical health ministry, my career, and notably my focus on educating people how to use essential oils therapeutically. Driving Passion One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see. ~ John 9:25 For as long as he can remember, Dr. Z has been burdened with the yearning desire to live a life of meaning. Growing up in the outskirts of Detroit, MI he often wondered how a truck driver's kid could do \"great things\" with his life without resources and influential people to support him. Plagued by addiction, depression, gut disorders, skin conditions, and utter hopelessness, Dr. Z's life was radically transformed in 2003 when he became a Christian. Immediately recognizing that healthy living was a spiritual act of worship, he started to change his eating and lifestyle habits. One by one, each health issue that haunted him from his youth started to fade away. For the first time in his life, he found purpose for living and started to share his story and research with everyone around him. Approach For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. ~ I Corinthians 3:11 Dr. Z's approach to his work is multi-disciplinary, believing that no \"one source\" exists for people to use to solve all of life's challenges. His success can be attributed to good ol' fashioned hard work, long hours and seeking only after those endeavors that are God-breathed. As Dr. Z continues in his calling to help reshape peoples' lives toward their God-given destiny, he has been increasingly inspired to create partnerships with like-minded people who also want to be the change that they want to see in the world. \"God has laid for us the foundation in the Bible. It is now our responsibility to partner, build, and grow in the knowledge that this world needs to live the Abundant Life!\" Training Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. ~ I Corinthians 9:25 For over a decade, Dr. Z has been formally trained as a natural health care provider, chiropractor and researcher with the intent to educate, inspire and challenge people to live their God-given potential. He was on the esteemed Research Track while earning his [Doctor of Chiropractic degree at Life University. ](https://www.life.edu/)Since 2016, he has been studying aromatherapy at the [Atlantic Institute of Aromatherapy](https://atlanticinstitute.com/). Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald may run with it. ~ Habakkuk 2:2 Dr. Z's primary vehicles of communicating Abundant Life truths are his writings, research and speaking engagements.
