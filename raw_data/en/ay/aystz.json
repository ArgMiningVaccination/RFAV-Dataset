Occasionally, patients at my Ann Arbor chiropractic office ask me whether I think they should have the flu vaccination. Most often, I tell them that there can be some negative effects from the vaccine and with that in mind they should research the vaccination so that they can make an informed decision. For a lot of people and for different reasons, the flu vaccine is controversial. Like many chiropractors, I think there are reasons to alert people to the potential negative affects of the vaccination with the understanding that vaccinations may be right for some. If people really press me for a specific opinion on the vaccine this is what I tell them. For the majority of people the vaccine is probably unnecessary and may be harmful to their health. What makes one think twice about the vaccine is that it often contains toxic ingredients such as formaldehyde, hydro-cortisone and mercury. The vaccine can also have side effects such as muscle pain, fever, runny nose, headaches and so on. On the other hand, instead of getting the flu vaccine one can do things that don't negatively impact the body. One may be able to substitute the vaccine by strengthening their immune system (naturally) thus decreasing one's likelihood of getting the flu. A non toxic natural approach to strengthening the immune system should include the following: stress management, supplementation that should include among other things echinacea, garlic and zinc, a healthful diet, acupuncture and of course chiropractic. Chiropractic studies have demonstrated that regular chiropractic care improves nerve system function and immune system strength thus reducing the chances of getting the flu.
