The compound contains tw o chirality cent res and is manufactured as a single stereoisomer. It is practically insoluble in water and is non- hygroscopic. Avacopan exhibits polymorphism. Synthesis: The synthesis of avacopan consists of several chemical transformation steps. Adequate information is provided regarding the manufacturing process, materials , critical steps and intermediates. Specification: The drug substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification, assay, impurities, residual solvents, elemental impurities, water content and residue on ignition. The applied limits are justified and in line with the relevant guidelines. The analytical methods are adequately described and the non -compendial methods are fully validated in accordan ce with the ICH guidelines. Stability: The stability of the drug substance was investigated with commercial scale batches which were manufactured by the proposed commercial manufacturing site. The stability samples were stored under long -term conditions (25\u00b0C/60% rh) and accelerated conditions (40\u00b0C/75% rh) as defined in the corresponding ICH Guideline on stability studies. Based on these studies, an adequate retest period was defined. 3.2 Drug Product Swissmedic has not assessed the primary data relating to the Drug Product of this application and is adopting the results of the assessment of the foreign reference authority (see section 2.1 Applicant's Request / Work -sharing procedure) . 3.3 Quality Conclusions Satisfactory and consistent quality of drug substance and drug product has been demonstrated. SwissPAR 7 / 10 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 4 Nonclinical Aspects 4.1 Pharmacology Avacopan inhibited the C5a receptor (C5aR1) in vitro at concentrations in the range of the clinical concentration range (0.4 -0.6 nM, unbound). The monkey and hamster C5aR1 was in the nanomolar range as well. The major human metabolite M1 had a similar potency. Avacopan had no or low pharmacological activity on mouse, rat and rabbit C5aR1 in concentrations up to 4 or 10 \u00b5M . In a human C5aR knock -in mouse model, avacopan blocked C5a- mediated leukopenia with an IC 50 of 15 nM and ex vivo CD11b upregulation in neutrophils avacopan inhibited C5a- induced neutropenia in cynomolgus monkeys at clinically relevant exposures. Also, the drug substantially reduced the percentage of glomeruli with crescents and necrosis at clinical ly relevant exposures in an ANCA -vasculitis mouse model. Secondary pharmacology studies demonstrated that avacopan is a highly selective antagonist of C5aR1 without any relevant off -target activity at the clinical exposure. Safety pharmacology studies in rats and the in vitro hERG assay did not indicate any alert at the clinical exposure. It is no ted that avacopan is not pharmacologically active in rats. However, additional assessments of behaviour, electrocardiogram, respiratory and renal function in the monkey toxicity studies at exposures in excess of the clinical exposure did not raise safety concerns. 4.2 Pharmacokinetics Avacopan has low solubility and high permeability in vitro . Total body clearance was moderate following IV administration (30-50% of liver blood flow). To improve oral bioavailability an optimised oral formulation was used for the toxicology study which was not identical to the clinical formulation. After oral administration of the improved formulation avacopan was rapidly absorbed with a T max of 1- 2 h in rodents and 3.3 -4 h in monkeys. Oral bioavailability was moderate to high (87% in mice and 55- 104% in rats). Elimination half -lives were 2.9- 5.6h in rodents and 6 -15.3 h in monkeys. Exposures reached a plateau at approximately 100 mg/kg in rats and rabbits and 50 mg/kg in monkeys after short -term dosing. Exposure to avacopan and M1 w as higher after repeated long- term dosing and increased less than dose proportional ly at doses 15 mg/kg/day for avacopan. There were no gender -related differences in exposure. Avacopan bound strongly to plasma proteins in all animal species and in humans (>99.9%) in vitro . There was no preferential partitioning to red blood cells. Avacopan- related r adioactivity rapidly distributed to most tissues and organs in rats following single oral administration of 15 mg/kg. There was low distribution into the brain and spinal cord. Av acopan bound melanin- containing tissues in the eyes of pigmented rats. After 14 days, radioactivity was still detectable in various tissues. Placental transfer and the excretion into milk of avacopan were not assessed. All metabolites that were detected in vitro in human microsomes and hepatocytes were also found in at least one animal species used in the toxicology studies (rat, hamster, rabbit, monkey) and were mainly Phase I products. The avacopan plasma content was 50- 65% of total radioactivity in rats, 12% in monkeys and 30 -50% in humans. The only major circulating human metabolite M1, a methyl hydroxylation product (~12% of the total drug -related material), was also formed in the animal species. CYP3A4 was found to be the main enzyme for metabolism of avacopan. Elimination half - lives of total radioactivity were >88 h in rats, 144 h in monkeys and up to 21 days (510 h) in humans . Excretion was mainly via the faecal/biliary rout e in the animal species and humans. SwissPAR 8 / 10 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Berne www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 4.3 Toxicology All animal species (rat, hamster, rabbit and cynomolgus monkey) were considered suitable based on their ADME profile , while hamster and cynomolgus monkey were also pharmacological ly relevant. The dosing scheme (twice daily) and studies up to 13 weeks in hamsters, 26 weeks in rats and 44 weeks (including 5 weeks of nasogastric administration) in monkeys with oral administration, support the clinical dosing scheme for chronic treatment. Exposure of M1 was covered in the studies. No adverse effects of avacopan were observed in the repeat -dose toxicity studies up to the highest dose levels, corresponding to safety margins of 13.9 in rats, 4.7 in hamsters and 4.3 in monkeys. It is acknowledged that the animal exposure could not be further increased substantially despite efforts to optimise the dose formulation or us e of a different dosing route (oral and nasogastric administration in monkeys) . Avacopan was not genotoxic in a standard genotoxicity testing battery. Two-year carcinogeni city studies in rats and hamsters did not indicate any tumorigenic potential at exposures 3.7- to 6-fold the clinical exposure for avacopan and at the clinical exposure for M1. Fertility of hamsters was not affected at exposures 6.8 -fold the clinical AUC. Embryofetal development studies were conducted in hamsters and rabbits. There were no fetal findings except for short thoracolumbar supernumerary ribs (skeletal variation) in the hamster at an exposure 5.3-fold the clinical AUC. There was an increased inci dence of abortions compared to control groups in rabbits. The applicant considered this only relevant at the highest dose level. As there was a <2- fold difference in exposure across the avacopan dose groups, a NOAEL for maternal toxicity is considered to be not established in rabbits. Exposure at the highest dose, i.e. the embry ofetal NOAEL, w as below the clinical exposure. There were no adverse findings in the pre - and postnatal development study in hamsters up to an exposure 6.3- fold the clinical exposure. Avacopan should not be given during pregnancy and lactation according to the I nformation for healthcare professionals. Avacopan had no phototoxic potential in vitro . It is noted that the T cell -dependent antibody response (TDAR) assessments in the 13- week rat study and in the 44- week monkey study had some technical limitations. As the rat is not considered to be a pharmacological ly relevant species, target -related immunotoxicity could not be appropriately assessed. However, the overall toxicity profile in monkeys and hamsters did not indicate an immunotoxicity risk. There are no concerns with regard to the impurities or excipients. Based on the ERA, the risk for the environment resulting from use of avacopan is considered to be low. According to the PIP, two studies in juvenile animals are still pending. The RMP provides adequate information about the nonclinical data. 4.4 Nonclinical Conclusions Overall, the submitted nonclinical documentation is considered sufficient to support the approval of Tavneos wit h the active ingredient avacopan in the proposed indication. The pharmacological properties and the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles of avacopan were adequately characterised. There are no concerns from the nonclinical standpoint regarding approval. A ll nonclinical data that are relevant for safety are included in the I nformation for healthcare professionals.

Information for healthcare prof essionals as an adjunctive treatment to standard immunosuppress ive treatment that includes rituximab or cyclophosphamide with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe, active antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) -associated vasculitis . Dosage/A dministration Treatment with Tavneos must be initiated and monitored by healthcare professionals with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of ANCA -associated vasculitis (GPA and MPA). Dose adjustment/titration The recommended dose of Tavneos is 30 mg (3 hard capsules of 10 mg each) taken orally twice daily, in the morning and evening, with food. Rituximab or cyclophosphamide with glucocorticoids should be administered as follows: rituximab for 4 weekly intravenous doses, or, intravenous or oral cyclophosphamide for 13 or 14 weeks, followed by oral azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids, as clinically indicated. Initiation of treatment Before starting Tavneos, consider the following tests: hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology should be performed prior to initiating Tavneos therapy to assess baseline liver function. A physician specialis ed in the management of hepatitis B must be consulted regarding patients with evidence of previous or current HBV infection to assess the need for HBV treatment prior to or during treatment with Tavneos. The use of Tavneos is not recommended in patients with cirrhosis, particularly in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh class C) (see Special warnings and precautions for use, Hepatotoxicity). Information for healthcare prof essionals 2022- 09-29 Avacopan CH_P I_EN V1.0 3 / 20 Dosage adjustment following undesirable effects /interactions Treatment must be clinically re-assessed and temporarily discontinued if: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels are higher than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and less than 5 times the ULN. Tavneos treatment must be stopped temporarily if: ALT or AST is greater than 5 times the ULN. The patient shows leukopenia (white blood cell count < 2 \u00d7 109/L) or (neutrophil count < (lymphocyte count < 0.2 \u00d7 109/L). The patient has an active and serious infection. Treatment with Tavneos can be resumed: Once the possibility of drug- induced liver injury has been ruled out. After normalisation of liver function parameters based on an individual benefit/ risk assessment . If treatment is resumed, transaminases and total bilirubin levels must be closely monitored. Permanent discontinuation of the treatment must be considered in any of the following situations: ALT or AST >8 times the ULN; ALT or AST >5 times the ULN for more than 2 weeks; ALT or AST level >3 times the ULN and total bilirubin level >2 times the ULN or INR (International Normalised Ratio) >1.5; ALT or AST >3 times the ULN with fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness, with fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%); An associat ion between Tavneos and liver dysfunction has been established. Patients with hepatic disorders No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (as indicated by Child- Pugh). Tavneos has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh class C) and therefore is not recommended for use in these patient populations. Information for healthcare prof essionals 2022- 09-29 Avacopan CH_P I_EN V1.0 4 / 20 Patients with renal disorders No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild, moder ate or severe renal function impairment. Tavneos has not been studied in patients with ANCA -associated vasculitis who are on dialysis. Elderly patients Of the 86 elderly patients who received Tavneos in the randomised Phase III clinical trial in ANCA -associated vasculitis, 62 patients were 65- 74 years old and 24 patients were 75 years old or older. No differences in overall safety or efficacy were observed between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients . Children and adolescents The safety and efficacy of Tavneos in children (under 18 years of age) have not yet been established. Data in adolescents (aged 12- 17 year s) are limited. There is no information available for children under 12 years of age. Based on the limited information, no recommendation on final dosing for children aged 12 to 17 years can be given. Delayed administration If a patient misses a dose, the missed dose is to be taken as soon as possible, unless within three hours of the next scheduled dose. If within three hours of the next scheduled dose, the missed dose is not to be taken and the next dose be taken normally. Inform the patient not to double the next dose. Mode of administration Tavneos is intended for oral use. The hard capsules must be swallowed whole with water during a meal and must not be crushed, chewed or opened. Grapefruit juice is to be avoided in patients treated with Tavneos. Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Information for healthcare prof essionals 2022- 09-29 Avacopan and precautions Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatic injury has been observed in patients receiving Tavneos. Clinical trials have reported an increased incidence of transaminase elevations and hepatobiliary events in patients treated with Tavneos, including severe and life- threatening cases (see Adverse Reactions). Liver function must be performed before initiating Tavneos, every 4 weeks after therapy initiation for the first 6 months, and as often as clinically indicated thereafter. Patients must be monitored for liver transaminases and total bilirubin if clinically indicated and as part of the routine monitoring of the patient's underlying disease. Tavneos must be avoided in patients with signs of liver disease, such as elevated AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or total bilirubin higher than 3 times the ULN. Tavneos is not recommended for use in patients with chronic, active, untreated and/or uncontrolled liver disease (e.g., chronic active hepatitis B, untreated hepatitis C, uncontrolled autoimmune hepatitis) or cirrhosis. It is important to consider the risks and benefits of the drug before administering it to a patient with liver disease. Patients must be closely monitored for the development of hepatic adverse reactions. Angioedema Tavneos may cause angioedema (see Adverse Reactions). In clinical trials, two cases of angioedema were reported, one of which was severe and required hospitalisation. I n case of angioedema, Tavneos must be dis continued immediately and appropriate care and monitoring for impairment of the respiratory tract must be undertaken. Tavneos must not be resumed unless another cause has been identified. Patients should be trained to recognise the signs and symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction and should seek immediate medical care if one occurs. Blood and Immune System A white blood cell count must be performed before initiating treatment and patients must be monitored as clinically indicated, as part of routine follow -ups of the patient's underlying condition. Treatment with Tavneos must not be initiated if the white blood cell count is less than 3 ,500/L, the neutrophil count less than 1 ,500/L, or the lymphocyte count less than 500/L. 09-29 V1.0 6 / 20 Patients receiving Tavneos must immediately report any signs of infection, unexpected bruising, bleeding, or other manifestations of bone marrow failure. Serious Infections Serious infections, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients treated with Tavneos. The most freq uently reported serious infections in the Tavneos group were pneumonia (4.8%) and urinary tract infections (1.8%). Tavneos must not be administered to patients with active and severe infections, including localised infections. The risks and benefits must be considered before initiating treatment with Tavneos in patients: with a chronic or recurrent infection; with a history of tuberculosis; with a history of severe or opportunistic infections; who have visited or travelled to areas with endemic tuberculosi s or fungal infections; or who have underlying conditions that may predispose them to infections. During and after treatment with Tavneos, patients must be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection. Tavneos must be discontinued in the event of a serious or opportunistic infection. Perform a prompt and complete diagnos tic test adapted to immunosuppression , if a patient develops a new infection during treatment with Tavneos. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be started, and the patient closely monitored. Tavneos should be stopped if the patient does not respond to this treatment. Tavneos treatment can continue only after the infection is under control. Prophylactic treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia Administration of prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is recommended during treatment with Tavneos in adult patients w ith GPA or MPA, in accordance with local clinical practice guidelines . Reactivation of the Hepatitis B virus Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, including life -threatening hepatitis B, has been observed in the clinical program. Information for healthcare prof essionals 2022- defi ned as an abrupt increase in HBV replication, which manifests through an increase in serum HBV DNA levels or HBsAg detection in a person who was previously HBsAg negative and anti -HBc positive. Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis , i.e. increased levels of transaminases. In severe cases, increased bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death may occur. Patients must be screened for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti -HBc before starting treatment with Tavneos. Patients with evidence of past or current hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection must be seen by a physician specialised in the management of hepatitis B for monitoring and possible HBV infection treatment before and/or during treatment with Tavneos. Patients showing signs o f current or previous HBV infection based on clinical and laboratory examinations that may indicate signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation must be monitored for six months following treatment with Tavneos. In patients who develop HBV reactivation while on Tavneos, immediately discontinue Tavneos and any concomitant therapies associated with HBV reactivation and start appropriate treatment. There is insufficient data on the safety o f resuming Tavneos in patients who have developed HBV reactivation. Resumption of treatment with Tavneos in patients whose HBV reactivation has resolved should be discussed with physicians specialised in the management of HBV infection. Cardiac disorders Patients with GPA or MPA are at risk of cardiac disorders such as myocardi al infarction, cardiac failure, and cardiac vasculitis. Serious adverse events (SAEs) of cardiac disorder have been reported in patients treated with Tavneos. Some treatment regimens may increase the risk of cardiac disorders (a regimen based on a combination of cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine may carry an increased risk of cardiac disorders , as compared to a regimen based on the combination with rituximab) . Immunisation The safety of immunisation with live vaccines after taking Tavneos has not been studied. Vaccines should preferably be administered before starting treatment with Tavneos or during the remission phase of the disease. Information for healthcare prof essionals 2022- 09-29 Avacopan CH_P I_EN V1.0 8 / 20 medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancies . Clinical data is currently limited. Interaction with strong CYP3A4 inducers The use Tavneos is to be avoided ( see Interactions). Patients anticipated to require long -term administration of these medicinal products are not to be treated with Tavneos . If short -term co -administration cannot be avoided in a patient already using Tavneos, the patient must be closely monitored for any reoccurrence of disease activity. Macrogolglycerol Hydroxystearate Tavneos contains macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate as an excipient, which may upset the stomach and cause diarrhoea. Interactions Avacopan is a substrate of CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of avacopan. Influence of other substances on the pharmacokinetics of avacopan Effect of strong CYP3A4 inducers and rifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, resulted in a decrease in the area under the concentration- time curve (AUC) and the maximum concentration (Cmax) of avacopan in plasma by approximately 93% (geometric mean ratio [GMR]: 7%) and 79% (GMR: 21%), respectively. As this interaction may result in loss of avacopan efficacy, the use of strong wort) with avacopan is to be avoided. Patients w ho are scheduled for long- term administration of these medicinal products are not to be treated with avacopan. If short -term co -administration cannot be avoided in a patient already receiving avacopan, the patient should be closely monitored for any reoccurrence of disease activity. Information for healthcare prof essionals 2022- 09-29 Avacopan CH_P CYP3A4 inducers on avacopan Concomitant administration of moderate inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine and modafinil) is not recommended. If concomitant administration cannot be avoided in a patient already using avacopan, there should be close monitoring for reoccurrence of disease activity. Effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors on avacopan Co-administration of avacopan with itraconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in an increase in avacopan AUC and of approximately 119% (GMR: 219%) 87% (GMR: 187%), respectively. Therefore, the dose of avacopan should be reduced to 30 mg once daily when strong CYP3A4 Grapefruit and grapefruit juice can increase avacopan concentration; therefore, grapefruit and grapefruit juice are to be avoided in patients treated with avacopan. Influence of avacopan on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products Effect of cytochrome of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, as indicated by a modest increase in the AUC of drugs tested such as midazolam (1.81 times) and celecoxib (1.15 times), respectively. Avacopan may increase the plasma levels of concomitant drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9. Be cautious when CYP3A4 substrates fentanyl, sirolimus and tacrolimus) are used with avacopan. Patients should be managed in accordance with the prof essional information of medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index . Effect of avacopan on substrates of other cytochromes and CYP2B6. Therefore, when avacopan is co essionals 2022- 09-29 Avacopan CH_P I_EN with substrates of these CYP enzymes, it is unlikely to significantly affect the exposure of substances that are metabolised by these CYP enzymes. Effect of avacopan on transporters Avacopan showed negligible on sensitive P -glycoprotein (P -gp) substrates. relevant effect of pient macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate on sensitive low bioavailability (e.g., dabigatran etexilate) cannot be excluded. Exercise caution when using low -bioavailability P -gp substrates in patients who are being treated with avacopan. Pregnancy , lactation Pregnancy There is no data on the use of avacopan in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown evidence of reproductive toxicity (see Preclinical safety data). Avacopan is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of chi ldbearing potential not using contraception. Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after treatment discontinuation. Lactation In animals, avacopan was not measured in the milk of lactating females; however, avacopan was detected in the plasma of nursing animal offspring with no apparent effects on the offspring. There is no data in nursing women. It is not known if avacopan is excreted through breast milk. A risk to neonates/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be taken whether to discontinue breastfeeding or avacopan considering the benefit of breastfeeding for the child compared to the benefit of the treatment for the woman. Fertility There is no data on the effects of avacopan on hu man fertility. Animal data did not indicate any impairment of male or female fertility.

Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The safety of Tavneos was evaluated in two (2) phase II clinical studies and one (1) phase III clinical study with a total of 239 subjects with ANCA -associated vasculitis who received at least one dose of Tavneos. Adverse reactions were determined based on data coming from the Tavneos clinical development program. The frequencies of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are those reported in the pivotal phase III study (n=330); of these 330 subjects, 166 were in the Tavneos group and 164 were in the prednisone group. The most common adverse drug reactions in patients with ANCA -associated vasculitis who received Tavneos in mycophenolate mofetil rituximab were headache (20.5%), nausea (23.5%) and vomiting (15.1%). Only one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) of nausea was considered serious. There were no reports of vomiting and headache that were considered serious. The serious adverse reactions that were reported more frequently in the Tavneos -treated patients than in the prednisone groups were pneumonia (4.8% vs. 3.7%), urinary tract infection vs. 1.2%) and liver function abnormality (1.2% vs. 0.0%). In the pivotal phase III study, 7 patients (4.2%) in the Tavneos group and 2 patients (1.2%) in the prednisone group discontinued treatment due to hepatic adverse reactions, including hepatobiliary adverse events and liver enzyme abnormalities. The most common adverse reaction that lead to discontinuation in at least 1 patient was liver function abnormalities (1.8%), which was more common in patients treated with Tavneos. In the pivotal phase III study, 2 subjects (1.2%) in the Tavneos group experienced an angioedema TEAE. One subject was hospitalised due to this event. Tavneos treatment was discontinued, and the angioedema did not reappear. Avacopan CH_P I_EN V1.0 12 / 20 List of adverse reactions The adverse reactions observed in the ANCA -associated vasculitis pivotal phase 3 study in patients treated with Tavneos are listed in Table 1 by system organ class (SOC) and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (1/10), common (1/100 to <1/10) and uncommon (1/1 ,000 to <1/100). Within each frequency group, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. Table1 : Summary of adverse reactions in the pivotal phase III ANCA -associated vasculitis study.

The study drug was discontinued or permanently stopped due to liver enzyme abnormalities in 5 patients (3.0%) in the prednisone group and 9 patients (5.4%) in the Tavneos group. Serious hepatic adverse reactions were reported in 6 patients (3.7%) in the prednisone group and in 9 patients (5.4%) in the Tavneos group. One serious hepatic adverse reaction was reported in one patient in the Tavneos group in the phase II studies. Increased creatine phosphokinase In the pivotal phase III study, 1 patient (0.6%) in the prednisone group and 6 patients (3.6%) in the Tavneos group experienced adverse reactions of increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK). One patient treated with Tavneos discontinued treatment due to increased creatine phosphokinase. Hypersensitivity, including angioedema In the pivotal phase III study, 2 patients (1.2%) in the Tavneos group experienced an adverse event of angioedema. One patient was hospitalised due to this event. Tavneos was discontinued and both events resolved wi thout sequelae. Tavneos was resumed in one patient and the angioedema did not reappear. Paediatric population Due to limited data in adolescents (12- 17 years of age), the safety and efficacy of Tavneos in adolescents has not been established yet. There is no data in children under 12 years of age. Spec ific populations Elderly population In clinical studies, the safety profile was identical in patients of 65 years old or more and in adults less than 65 years old. Information for healthcare prof essionals 2022- 09-29 Avacopan CH_P I_EN V1.0 14 / 20 Reporting suspected adverse reactions aft er authorisation of the medicinal product is very important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are required to report any suspected new or serious adverse reactions via the online reporting portal ElViS (Electronic Vigilance System). For more information about this, visit www.swissmedic.ch . Overdose Tavneos has been studied in healthy subjects at a maximum total daily dose of 200 mg (adminis tered as a 100 mg dose twice daily) for 7 days without evidence of dose -limiting toxicity. In the event of an overdose, it is recommended to monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions and that appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care are provided. Properties/Effects ATC code: not yet assigned Mechanism of action Avacopan is a selective antagonist of the human complement component 5a receptor (C5aR1 or CD88) that competitively inhibits the interaction between C5aR1 and the anaphylatoxin C5a. C5a and C5aR1 play role in the pathogenesis of ANCA -associated vasculitis. Specific and selective blockade of C5aR1 by avacopan reduces the pro- inflammatory effects of C5a, which include neutrophil activation and migration, and leads to decreased adhesion at inflammation sites in small blood vessels, vascular endothelial cell retraction and increased of CD11b M) neutrophils collected from humans receiving avacopan. CD11b facilitates neutrophil adherence to vascular endothelial surfaces, one of the steps in the vasculitis process. Cardiac electrophysiology At the recommended authorised dose, avacopan does not prolong the QT interval in a clinically meaningful way. Information for healthcare prof essionals 2022- 09-29 Avacopan CH_P I_EN V1.0 15 / 20 Clinical efficacy A total of 330 patients aged 13 years or older with polyangiitis granulomatosis (GPA) (54.8%) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (45.2%) were the randomised, multicentre, active comparator, double -dummy , double- blind, 52 -week, pivotal phase III ADVOCATE study. Patients were randomised in a 1 to 1 ratio to one of two groups: Avacopan group (N=166): Patients received avacopan 30 mg twice daily for 52 weeks plus prednisone- matching placebo tapering regimen over 20 weeks, Prednisone group (N=164): Patients received an avacopan placebo twic e daily for 52 weeks plus prednisone (tapered from 60 mg/day to 0 over 20 weeks). All patients in both groups received standard immunosuppressive regimens of either : Rituximab 375 mg/m\u00b2 in 4 weekly intravenous doses, or Cyclophosphamide intravenously for 13 weeks (15 mg/kg up to 1.2 g every 2- 3 weeks), and then from week 15 onwards, azathioprine orally 1 mg/kg per day, with titration up to 2 mg/kg per day (mycophenolate mofetil 2 g per day was allowed instead of azathioprine. If mycophenolate mofetil was not tolerated or not available, enteric -coated mycophenolate sodium could be given at a target dose of 1 ,440 mg/day), or Cyclophosphamide orally for 14 weeks (2 mg/kg per day) followed by oral azathioprine or mycophenolate, mofetil/sodium from week 15 onwards (same dosing schedule as intravenous cyclophosphamide doses). Dose reductions or adjustments of cyclophosphamide, azathioprine and mycophenolate were permitted in accordance with standard practice to maxi mise the safety of these drugs. Glucocorticoids were allowed as pre- medication for rituximab to reduce hypersensitivity reactions, to taper glucocorticoids administered during the screening period, to treat persistent vasculitis, worsening of vasculitis or relapses, and for non -vasculitis related reasons such as adrenal insufficiency. Patients were stratified at time of randomisation to obtain a balance between treatment groups according to 3 factors: Newly diagnosed or relapsed with either intravenous rituximab or intravenous Avacopan CH_P I_EN V1.0 16 / 20 The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the above- described treatment regimens to induce and sustain remission in patients with ANCA -associated vasculitis based on the following two primary endpoints: the proportion of patients in disease remission defined as achieving a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) of 0 and not taking glucocorticoids for treatment of ANCA -associated vasculitis within 4 weeks prior to week 26, the proportion of patients in sustained remission defined as remission at week 26 without relapse to week 52, and BVAS of 0 and not taking glucocorticoids for treatment of ANCA - associated vasculitis within 4 weeks prior to week 52. The initial demographic and pathological profiles of the patients were balanced between the two treatment groups. The mean age of the patients was 60.9 years. Most patients were male (56.4%), Caucasian (84.2%) and had been newly diagnosed with the disease (69.4%). Patients had either GPA (54.8%) or MPA (45.2%) and had anti -PR3 antibodies (43.0%) or anti -MPO (57.0%) antibodies. The mean initial BVAS score was 16.2; pat ients most frequently had renal (81.2%), general (68.2%), ENT (43.6%) and chest (43.0%) manifestations. received 31% received i.v. cyclophosphamide and 4% received oral cyclophosphamide. Remission at Week 26 and su stained remission at Week 52 72.3% of patients in the TAVNEOS arm and 70.1% of patients in the prednisone arm achieved remission at week 26 (difference between treatments: 3.4%, 95% CI [ -6.0%, 12.8%]). At week 52, a significantly higher percentage of patients had achieved sustained remission in the TAVNEOS group (65.7%) compared to the prednisone does not eliminate the use of Glucocorticoids. In the phase 3 trial, the mean total cumulative prednisone- equivalent dose from day 1 to end- of-treatment was 3, 654.5mg in the comparator group and 1, 348.9mg in the avacopan group. In the comparator group, the majority of glucocorticoids use was due to the pr otocol -defined prednisolone course. Pharmacokinetics Absorption When administered without food, avacopan peak plasma concentration (C max) occurs at a median time (t max) of approximately 2 hours. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated mean plasma exposure of avacopan and the M1 metabolite at steady state are 3 ,466 Information for healthcare prof essionals 2022- 1, 283 \u00b1 541 ng-h/ml, respectively for the area under the 12- hour plasma drug concentration curve (AUC 0-12h) and 349 \u00b1 169 ng-h/ml, 122 \u00b1 49.4 ng-h/ml, respectively, for the maximum plasma concentration (C max) in patients with ANCA -associated vasculitis receiving avacopan 30 mg twice daily. Steady -state plasma concentrations of avacopan are reached within 13 weeks and accumulation is approximately 4- fold. Avacopan showed an approximate dose -proportional increase in systemic exposure over the dose rang ing from 10 to 100 mg. The absorption fraction in humans is at least 93% in a solution formulation. Co-administration of a 30 mg hard capsule and a high -fat, high-calorie meal increases the plasma exposure (AUC) of avacopan by approximately 72% (AUC ratio food/fasting = 1.72) and delays the t max by approximately 3 hours. However, it has no effect on C max. Eating had no observable significant effect on the M1 m etabolite AUC, but its C max was 51% lower in the fed state. Distribution The reversible plasma protein binding (e.g. to albumin and alpha -1-acid glycoprotein) of avacopan and the M1 metabolite is greater than 99.9%. The apparent volume of distribution is high (Vz/F 3,000 -11,000 L), indicating broad tissue distribution of the drug. Metabolism Avacopan is eliminated mainly through phase I metabolism. Following oral administration of radiolabelled avacopan, the bulk of the active substance- related material s was recovered in the faeces as phase I metabolites. A major circulating metabolite (M1), a monohydroxylated product of avacopan, was present in ~12% of the total active substance- related materials in plasma. This metabolite constitutes 30- 50% of the parent exposure and has approximately the same effect on C5aR1 as avacopan. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for the clearance of avacopan and the formation and clearance of the M1 metabolite. Elimination Based on population pharmaco kinetic analysis, the total apparent body clearance (CL/F) of avacopan is 16.3 l/h (95% CI: The median effective half -life is 36.8 hours (1.5 days) and the median terminal elimination half -life is 510 hours (21 days) based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. When avacopan is discontinued after steady state has been reached , the residual plasma concentration of avacopan is expected to decrease to ~20%, Information essionals and <5% of the maximum steady state concentration in approximately 4 weeks, 7 week s and 10 weeks after the last dose, respectively. Following oral administration of radiolabelled avacopan, approximately 77% and 10% of the radioactivity was recovered in the faeces and urine, respectively, with 7% and less than 0.1% of the radioactive dose recovered as unchanged avacopan in the faeces and in the urine, respectively. These results suggest that the main route of clearance of avacopan is metabolism, followed by biliary excretion of metabolites in the faeces. Kinetics in speci fic patient groups Hepatic impairment The pharmacokinetic properties of ava copan were evaluated in 16 patients with mild (Child- Pugh class A) or moderate (Child- Pugh class B) hepatic impairment. No significant changes in pharmacokinetics were observed compared to healthy volunteers. In subjects with mild or moderate liver function impairment, avacopan AUC (geometric mean) increased respectively (healthy: 123 ng/ml; mild: 107 ng/ml; mode rate: 102 ng/ml), compared to subjects with normal liver function. In subjects with mild or moderate liver function impairment, the AUC of the M1 metabolite increased by 11% compared to patients with normal liver function. Avacopan has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh class C). Renal impairment In the phase III study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ranges studied were <30 ml/min/1.73 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2 (55 subjects). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, plasma exposure of avacopan is similar between patients with renal impairment and patients with normal renal function. Avacopan has not been studied in patients with ANCA -associated vasculitis who are on dialysis. 2022- 09-29 Avacopan CH_P I_EN V1.0 19 / 20 Elderly p atients In the phase III study, the age range of subjects was 13- 83 years and 46 subjects (13.9%) were >75 years of age. Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no significant effect of age (in adults) on plasma exposure to avacopan; however, pharmacokinetic data of clinical trials were limited for patients over 75 years of age. Ethnicity No clinically meaningful differences in plasma concentrations of avacopan and the M1 metabolite were observed according to ethnicity (Caucasian, Asian, or Black population). Preclinical data The non- clinical data do not indicate any particular hazard for humans based on conventional safety pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity studies. Genotoxicity Avacopan was not genotoxic based on the results of the bacterial mutagenicity (Ames test), mouse lymphoma (TK) and in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assays . Carcinogenicity The carcinogenic potential of avacopan was assessed in a 2- year study in rats and hamsters. Avacopan was not car cinogenic in rats and hamsters at exposures from 3.7 to 6 -fold the clinical dose. Reproductive toxicity Fertility and early embryonic development Avacopan had no effect on male or female reproductive performance (fertility) or early development in hamsters at oral doses of up equivalent up to 6.8 -fold the clinical AUC. Embryofoetal development Avacopan was not teratogenic when administered orally to hamsters and rabbits. In hamsters, an increased incidence of skeletal variations (short thoracolumbar supernumerary rib) was observed at exposure equivalent to 5.3 -fold the clinical AUC. In rabbits, avacopan caused 09-29 Avacopan CH_P I_EN V1.0 20 / 20 maternal toxicity (adverse clinical signs and abortions), but no foetal toxicity at 0.6 -fold the clinical AUC. Pre- and post -natal development Avacopan did not cause adverse reactions in the offspring of hamsters exposed to up to 6.3- fold the clinical AUC during the gestation and lactation periods until weaning. Analysis of avacopan plasma levels in lactating females and plasma levels in nursing pups revealed the presence of avacopan. This finding indicated that avacopan is likely secreted into the breast milk of lactating hamsters.
