Acupoint-stimulation could potentially be an effective intervention for PD. Our aim was to determine the effectiveness of acupoint-stimulation compared with Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NASIDs) in the treatment of PD. Methods: Six databases were searched to December 2014. Sixteen studies involving 1679 PD patients were included. We included randomized controlled trials that compared acupoi nt-stimulation with NASIDs for the treatment of PD. The main outcomes assessed were clinical effectiveness rate, symptom s core, visual analogue score, variation in peripheral blood prostaglandin F2 (PGF2 ) and side effects. All analyses were performed us ing Comprehensive Meta-Analysis statistical software. Results: (1) The total efficacy was better than control group: odds ratio = 5.57; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 3.96, 7. 83;P< 0.00001; (2) The effect of intervention was positive in r elieving the severity of PD symptoms: mean 95%CI = P< 0.00001; (3) No statistical difference ex isted between two groups in terms of a reduction in the VAS: MD = 1.24; 95%CI = 3.37, 5.85; P= 0.60; (4) The effect of intervention on the variation in peripheral blood PGF2 between two groups was positive: MD = 7.55; 95%CI = 4.29,10.82; P< 0.00001; (5) The side effects of control groups was more than the acupoint-stimulation group: OR = 0.03; to this article, acupoint-stimulation can relieve pain effectively in the treatment of PD and offers advantages in increasing the overall effectiveness. Keywords: Primary dysmenorrhoea, Meta drugs Background Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecologic com- plaint among adolescent and young adult females. The prevalence of dysmenorrhoea appears to differ across the world, ranging from 80% in Western Australia [1], to 60%in Canada [2], 48.4% in Mexico [3], and 79.9% in Iran [4]. Over 50% of females of reproductive age have painful menstruation; among them, 10% have severe dysmenor- rhoea, whereby their monthly lives 'quality is impaired from 1 to 3 days differently [5]. It starts some hours before menstruation and continues for up to 48 -72 h, and takes the form of pains and cramps in the lower abdomen radiating towards the inner side of the thighs [6]. Half of such cases experience systemic symptoms, such as nau- sea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, irritability and dizziness [7, 8], which reduce the quality of life. The patients with mild-to-moderate pain can manage their pain without* Correspondence: zaky@ufl.edu ;haiguagua@163.com Equal contributors 7Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Florida, 1006 Center Drive, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA 9Laboratory of Anatomy, School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No. 88 Yu Quan Road, Nankai District, Tianjin 300193, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article \u00a9 The Author(s). 2017 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

However, approximately 15% of all women experience se- vere dysmenorrhoea to a level that affects work or study; such women need drugs to relieve their pain [9]. Dysmen- orrhea in adolescents and young adults is usually primary, and is defined as painful menses in women with normal pelvic anatomy [10]. In ~ 10% of females with severe dys- menorrhea symptoms, pelvic abnormalities such as endo- metriosis or uterine anomalies may be found (secondary dysmenorrhea) [11]. This article mainly discusses primary dysmenorrhoea (PD). In recent years, there are more and more researches about the pathogenesis of PD. I n addition to factors relating to the body 's nerve, genetic and immune systems, and psy- chological/social factors, the pathogenesis is generally con- sidered to be mainly related to two factors: (1) abnormal uterine contraction, and (2) endocrine and metabolic fac- tors. The state of uterine ischemia and hypoxia causes the uterine muscle to contract, increasing intrauterine tension, and so leading to abdominal pain. Patients with abnormal uterine contractions and the subjective feeling of abdominal colic have been consistently reported over time. Many types of molecular endocrine factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD, such as prostaglandins (PGs), oxy- (NE), endothelins, and In F2 (PGF2 ), cyclooxygenase (COX) contrac- tions, leading to uterine ischemia and pain [12]. Treatment for PD includes a variety of pharmaco- logical and non-pharmacological methods. Common pharmacological interventions Drugs (NASIDs) and oral contracep- tives. NSAIDs are widely used as the first-line therapy for females with dysmenorrhoea [13, 14]. However, there are often adverse events associated with the use of NSAIDs, including stomach ache, diarrhoea, nausea, and liver or kidney damage after discontinuing medication [13]. Therefore, many patients with PD are seeking com- plementary and alternative techniques such as acupoint- stimulation to treat the symptoms of PD [15], which em- phasizes stimulating the acupoint(s) to strengthen the body 's endogenetic regulated function, so as to prevent- ing and treating diseases by regulating the meridian system. Although previously publications have reported that acupuncture-related treatments are effective for primary dysmenorrhea, the evidence is low convincing due to in- sufficient methodological quality and small sample size. Given the safety of acupoint-stimulation [16], therefore, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis study is to determine the effectiveness of acupoint- stimulation in treating PD.Methods Search strategy We searched six electronic databases that included PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, the Chinese Academic Journals Full-text Database, the Chinese Science and Technology Journal Full-text Database (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (VIP). The index terms were the following: dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, painful men- struation, menstrual, acupuncture, moxibustion, auricular acupoint (administering persistent/ temporary pressure with Cowherb seed/finger force to stimulate pressure points), electroacupuncture, acusec- tor, acupoint application, randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, and random. The above terms in Chinese were adapted and searched in Chinese data- bases. The studies were published between the first year they were available and December 2014, which of the language is Chinese and English. Selection criteria and exclusion criteria Selection criteria /C15Research Type /C15Research Subjects /C15Interventions /C15Outcomes ( Clinical effectiveness rate, Symptom score, Visual analogue score, Peripheral blood PGF2 , Side effects ) Research type Randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Research subjects Patients with a definite PD diagnosis: PD is defined as painful menses in women with normal pelvic anatomy. An eligible patient is diagnosed based on the PD Clinical Guideline of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecolo- gists of Canada. Interventions Intervention Control groups -NSAIDs. Outcomes (1) Clinical effectiveness rate It was a dichotomous outcome and the overall effect- iveness of acupoint-stimulation therapy as a subjective assessment, which was defined as the proportion of par- ticipants who got relieved pain and was based on re- sponse evaluation criteria used in the treatment of insomnia with acupoint-stimulation. What 's more, it wasXuet al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2017) 17:436 Page 2 of 12reported by trial participants themselves. For example, clinical therapeutic effect criteria were categorized as cure, markedly effective, effective, or ineffective. Ac- cording to the Guideline for Clinical Trials of New Patent Chinese medicines (GCTNPCM) [17] evalu- ation standards, which define: Cured: after treatment, the score of symptoms was;restored to 0, abdominal pain and other symptoms disappeared and the dys- menorrhea did not recurred 3 menstrual cycles after treatment; Markedly effective: after treatment, the score of symptoms was decreased to less than 1/2 of the score before treatment, abdominal pain obviously relieved and other symptoms improved and the pa- tient without taking analgesics could insist in work; Effective: treatment,the score of symptoms de- creased to 1/2 -3/4 of the score before treatment, ab- dominal pain relieved and other symptoms improved, and the patient could work after taking analgesics; In- effective: abdominal pain and other symptoms did notchange. The total number of \"cure, markedly effective, effective \"were used to calculate effective rate. (2) Symptom score In accordance with the GCTNPCM, the patients 'symp- tom scores were recorded before and after treatment [18]. (3) Visual analogue score (VAS) In the paper, we draw a 10 cm above the horizontal line and horizontal line of the end of 0, indicating no pain; on the other side of 10, said the pain; middle part of said varying degrees of pain. Feel the patient accord- ing to uniform mark on the horizontal line, indicating the degree of pain [19]. (4) Peripheral blood PGF2 . The blood was taken from cubital vein within 24 h in the last menstrual period before treatment and within 24 h in the next menstrual period after treatment for one course, and the plasma PGF2 levels in the two groups were determined with radioimmunoassay.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2017) 17:436 Page 6 of 12between researchers with regard to the eligibility of a trial was resolved by consulting a third researcher. We created a form for data extraction which included: (1) basic information about each trial, including the topic, first author, dateline and journal; (2) basic information about the patients, including the number of cases in each group and the mean age; (3) the study design and intervention; and (4) the outcomes. The quality of the trials included in this study was assessed by other two researchers according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interven- tions, Version 5.1.0. Statistical analyses All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta- Analysis statistical software, RevMan 5.1.0 (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). Continuous out- come variables were analyzed using a standardized meas- ure; dichotomous variables were compared and the results presented as odds ratios/risk ratios (OR/RR). To obtain a standard deviation of the change from base- line for the experimental intervention, use (R 1= inter- vention; SD(F) represents the standard deviation after intervention.The research team evaluated homogeneity among the trials via I2.I fI2was50%, the trials were considered to be heterogeneous, and a random-effect model based on a Mantel-Haenszel (MH) or inverse variance (IV) statis- tical approach was selected. If I2was <50%, the studies were considered to be homogeneous, and a fixed-effects model based on an MH or IV statistical approach was used. Pooled summary statistics of the differences in the ratio or mean of the individual studies were developed. Pooled differences in ratios or means, and two-sided P- values were calculated and used as criteria for determin- ing the level of statistical significance. P< 0.05 was con- sidered to indicate statistical significance. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was conducted based on the leave- one-out cross-validation procedure [21]. Results Study selection A flow chart of the included/excluded studies is shown in Fig. 1. Database searches yielded 70 studies from PubMed, 28 from the Cochrane Central Register of Clin- ical Trials, 215 from Embase, 552 from CNKI, 328 from Wanfang Data, 279 from VIP, and 479 from CBM. After removal of duplicate records, 849 records remained. Fol- lowing the first review based on the title, 149 records were remained, and the abstracts were reviewed based on the pre-defined eligibility criteria. A total of 82 records were selected for full text review and data processing. During this Fig. 4 Meta-analysis of the VAS Fig. 5 Meta-analysis of the Peripheral Blood PGF2 Xuet al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2017) 17:436 Page 7 of 12phase, 63 papers were excluded, so 19 studies were included in the final meta-analysis, comprising 1679 participants. Characteristics of the included studies Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the 19 RCTs [18, 19, 22 -38]. Clinical outcomes Clinical effectiveness rate Seventeen trials examined the effects of acupoint- stimulation and reported the clinical effectiveness rate of treatment for participants with PD who used those therap- ies versus the rate for a control group. Analysis of pooled data using a fixed-effect model showed that the effect of intervention on the clinical effectiveness rate was positive [OR = 5.57, 95%CI (3.96, 7.83), P< 0.00001] (Fig. 2). That is to say, the clinical effectiveness rate, the acupoint- stimulation group being superior to the NSAIDs. Symptom score Six trials reported the symptom score. Analysis of pooled data using a fixed-effect model showed that the effect of intervention on the symptom score was positive [MD = 2.99, 95%CI (2.49, 3.49), P< 0.00001] (Fig. 3). The curative effect of acupoint-stimulation on PD is significant.visual analogue score Three trials reported the VAS; analysis of pooled data using a random-effect model showed that I2= 98%, indi- cating heterogeneity. So, the trial by Cao (2011) was ex- cluded from analysis, then analysis of the pooled data using a random-effect model showed that there was no statistical difference in variation of VAS between the groups receiving acupoint-stimulation and the control groups [MD = 1.24, 95%CI ( 3.37,5.85), P=0 . 6 0 F i g .4 ) . Peripheral blood PGF2 Four trials examined the effects of acupoint-stimulation and reported peripheral blood PGF2 of participants with PD who used those therapies versus the rate for a control group. Analysis of the pooled data using a fixed- effect model showed that the effect of intervention on the variation in peripheral blood PGF2 between the groups receiving acupoint-stimulation and the control groups was positive [MD = 7.55, 95%CI (4.29, 10.82), P< 0.00001] (Fig. 5). In the study, it is indicated that acupoint-stimulation can effectively decrease peripheral blood PGF2 level in the patient of PD, so as to inhibit PGF2 -induced spastic contraction of uterine muscle, improve the decrease of blood flow, and relieve the symptoms of the patient of dysmenorrhea.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2017) 17:436 Page 8 of 12Side effects Three trials reported the side effects between acupoint- stimulation and control group. Analysis of pooled data using a random-effect model showed that I2=8 3 % ,i n d i - cating heterogeneity. So the trial by Bo (2013) was ex- cluded from analysis, then analysis of the pooled data using a fixed-effect model showed that the side effects of control groups were more than the acupoint-stimulation group. [OR = 0.03, 95%CI (0.00, 0.22), P= 0.0005] (Fig. 6). Quality assessment The risks of seven biases among the 19 trials were evalu- ated, including random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases according to the criteria in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. Fifteen of the studies described correct randomization methods. There was only one trial with allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment, and nearly all of the trials failed to mention allocation con- cealment, the blinding of the participants and personnel, and the blinding of outcome assessments. The methodo- logical qualities of the included trials are summarized in Figs. 7 and 8. Funnel plot of publication bias The research team performed an analysis of all the in- cluded studies, using a funnel plot to determine publica- tion bias in all of the literature. The outcome from the funnel plot analysis is summarized in Fig. 9. The out- come suggests that there was little publication bias. Discussion Meta-analysis of clinical effect In the 19 RCTs included, 17 reported a clinical effective- ness rate and 6 reported symptom scores and 4 reported variation in the level of PGF2 in the peripheral blood of women with PD. The meta-analysis revealed that acupoint-stimulation is superior to NSAIDs in the treat- ment of PD in terms of clinical effectiveness rate and symptom improvement and reducing the concentration of PGF2 in peripheral blood. Only one RCT reported uterine artery blood flow sig- nals. The results showed that the uterine arterial pulsa- tion index (PI) and uterine arterial resistance index (RI) of the dysmenorrheal patients were significantly in- creased in the eye acupuncture group before treatment. Moreover, most studies used a subjective, self-reported index of treatment effects as the outcome measure. Be- cause participants self-reported without additional ob- jective outcomes, their pain status could not be assessed accurately [39]. Furthermore, the included studies used Fig. 8 Risk of bias summary: review authors 'judgements about each risk of bias item for each included studyXuet al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2017) 17:436 Page 9 of 12different treatments for the intervention group, such as acupuncture, moxibustion, ear acupressure, electroacu- puncture and acupoint application, which of the purpose is to highlight the specificity of acupoints. The reason for NSAIDs being a drug of positive control NSAIDs act by inhibiting the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to cyclic endoperoxides, namely COX, which in turn inhibits the production of PGs [40, 41]. The resulting lower levels of PGs lead to less vigorous contractions of the uterus, and therefore to less discomfort. Thus, NSAIDs alleviate primary dys- menorrheic pain predominantly through the suppression of endometrial PGs synthesis [42]. Although NSAIDs is the first-line treatment for PD, it also has shortcomings, which can inhibit the synthesis of COX-1, as well as COX-2, finally it is easy to cause adverse reactions of gastrointestinal and central nervous system. Vane [43] indicated in 1994 that the effective treatment effect of NSAIDs was due to inhibition of COX-2, however, the adverse reactions imputed the suppression of COX-1. Therefore, we consider that NSAIDs may be used as a drug of positive control. Although the results are encouraging, the conclusions from the current study should be carefully considered before being applied to clinical practice specific patients especially individuals with NSADIs contraindication. This study aims to collect all RCTs relating to acupoint- stimulation treatment of PD and use systematic review to gauge the effectiveness of acupoint-stimulation in the treatment of PD in order to use this treatment more widely in clinical practice.Different conclusions of the published literature Some evidence indicates that acupoint-stimulation is ef- fective in treating primary dysmenorrhea [44 -49], but that evidence was largely based on one small, random- ized, controlled trial. However, two more recent sham acupuncture randomized controlled trials failed to show evidence of pain reduction [50, 51]. One of the major challenges may be the subjective nature of the symp- toms 'presentations and acupoints utilized. Although a few reviews [15, 21, 52, 53] of acupuncture for the treat- ment of PD are currently available, none of those re- views analyze the potential mechanism of acupuncture for the treatment of PD, which is the key research con- tent in future. Therefore, a systematic review with a meta-analysis is necessary so that quality evidence can be put forward for the use (or not) of acupoint- stimulation for the treatment in individuals with PD. Limitations and strengths The limitations of this evaluation system are as follows: (1) most of the researches did not mention how the sample size was estimated, and most sample sizes were small, leading to a low inspection efficiency; (2) in some of the studies there was inadequate reporting of alloca- tion concealment; implementing or not fully implement- ing allocation concealment will lead to an exaggerated curative effect; (3) the results were heterogeneous on ac- count of their use of subjective indicators to evaluate the curative effect (symptom scores, VAS), so that implemen- tation of the blinding method is important, but the in- cluded studies did not describe the implementation of the blinding method; (4) the study was limited to Chinese and Fig. 9 Total Effects of Intervention GroupsXuet al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2017) 17:436 Page 10 of 12English research, leading to the possibility of selection bias, and the terminology or the guidelines used in clinical managements might not be in the same language. The strengths of this evaluation system are as follows: this is the first report that comparing the effect of acupoint-stimulation and NSADIs in the treatment of PD, and it provides new evidence and open new hori- zons that acupoint-stimulation can relieve pain effect- ively in the treatment of PD and offers advantages in increasing the overall effectiveness. Perspectives In our future research, we will conduct some trials relat- ing to acupoint-stimulation for the treatment of PD, which will focus on the following aspects to prevent bias: (1) an estimation of sample size, (2) a fully random design incorporating allocation concealment, and (3) a blind design for the proposer, performer and measurer. Conclusion The current evidence reveals that acupoint-stimulation in the treatment of PD has some obvious advantages com- pared with treatment by NSADIs. The advantages are that acupoint-stimulation can alleviate the symptoms of dys- menorrhoea, reduce the level of peripheral blood PGF2 and has fewer side effect, so it can be used to treat PD pa- Cyclooxygenase; COX-2: Cyclooxygenase 2; GCTNPCM: The Literature Database; Vasopressin Acknowledgments Medical writing services were provided by YiHeAn Biotechnology Co.
