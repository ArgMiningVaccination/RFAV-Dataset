The innovative project entitled 'Development of responsive control systems for an artificial lung', brought together Swansea University's College of Engineering with Swansea-based companies Haemair Ltd, Haemaflow Ltd, DTR Medical Ltd, and Staffordshire-based EGS Technologies Ltd. This project builds on previous successful work which established the feasibility of an artificial lung and it addresses two problems which emerged from that research namely the need to better understand the dynamic response of natural lungs according to metabolic demand, and the need to understand the effect of residence-time distribution on blood clotting in respiratory aids. World's first 'intelligent' artificial lung a step closer Both of these issues have been fundamentally addressed though the design of novel experimental work and the acquisition of a large database of empirical physiological data. A spokesman for Haemair said, \"The project has provided a much improved understanding of how the body controls respiration rate in response to mental and physical exercise; it has enabled us to refine a control system for our lung-assist device that responds in a way that mimics the body's own natural control systems. The research has generated a unique large-scale database of physiological data which will have great value for future developmental work. Equally importantly, we have gained a deeper understanding of the factors that determine the risks of blood clots arising in such respiratory aids\". As a result of this research, Haemair has developed an improved design of an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) device, or artificial lung, with reduced risk of blood clots. www.haemair.comWolfson Foundation support for new laboratory www.swansea.ac.uk/esdc advances advances advances walesNEWS NEWS 3 Issue 75/Spring 2015Swansea University has been awarded \u00a3200K by The Wolfson Foundation to equip a state-of-the-art laboratory at its new Bay Campus, which will be dedicated to facilitating a wide range of research in the field of power electronics and power systems.

The UK-led Beagle 2 Mars Lander, which hitched a ride on the ESA Mars Express mission, has been found partially deployed on the surface of Mars. This find shows that the 'Entry, Descent and Landing' sequence for Beagle 2 worked and the craft successfully landed. The team searching for Beagle 2 approached Dr Laurence Tyler and Dr Matt Gunn at the Institute of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science Moleculomics, a spin-out of Swansea University has recently been awarded prestigious funding from the NC3Rs through a CRACK-IT challenge to develop technologies to identify off-target Molecular Initiation Events (MIEs). The task involves linking these to associated Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) through the application of software technology developed at the university. This first of two possible project phases, will explore the potential for developing a computational version of routine laboratory screening of the toxicity of chemical compounds to humans which is typically limited to particular in vitro panels of enzymes and receptors, or whole system toxicity testing using animals. The developed technologies will provide toxicologists with a better understanding of the molecular interactions that lead to adverse reactions and toxicity. Aberystwyth space scientists help discover Beagle 2 on Mars Reducing animal testing through application of supercomputersat Aberystwyth University to provide detailed 3D images of the area where it was believed to have landed. Using powerful computer software developed by the Space Robotics Group at Aberystwyth University, Dr Tyler was able to provide a terrain map of the area from images taken by the HiRISE camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Commenting on the discovery of Beagle 2, Dr Tyler said, \"The team searching for Beagle 2 were interested in knowing what the slopes of the terrain were like in that region of Mars. We were able to show them that the area where the lander was supposed to have landed was very flat.\"Dr Tyler hopes to use the same technique to study the proposed landing sites for the European Space Agency's 2018 ExoMars rover mission. Beagle 2 was led by Professor Colin Pillinger from the Open University and Aberystwyth University space scientist Professor Dave Barnes played a key role in the development of one of the mission's defining features, its robotic arm. Sadly, Professor Pillinger died in May 2014 and Professor Barnes in July 2014. Professor Barnes was researching autonomous science sample acquisition methods for the ExoMars mission, and was a Co-investigator for the mission's Panoramic Camera (PanCam) science instrument (Advances 70). Dr Jonathan Mullins, Chairman of Moleculomics explains, \"the conventional points of use of animals in toxicity screening are becoming increasingly difficult to justify in light of the enormous computational advances of recent years. In any case, we know that chemicals found to be toxic in animals are not necessarily toxic in human (and vice versa) meaning the results of animal trials are not always useful. There is also the impact of natural polymorphic variation in human beings to be considered. We hope that utilising the supercomputing capacity offered by HPC Wales will provide genomescale molecular information to improve the efficiency of new compound research and development.\" With sponsorship from both Unilever and Dow AgroSciences, this CRACK-IT challenge is the NC3Rs' response to the changing environment in the biosciences. The aim is to accelerate the availability of technologies which will deliver benefit to the \"three Rs\"; the Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of the use of animals in scientific procedures. An emphasis of the funding is that the resulting technologies will be made commercially available with a view to maximising both scientific and commercial benefits of new and emerging technologies. \"This is one of 3 technologies competing in the first Phase of the competition and if successful, will reduce animal use and add real scientific and business value to a broad range of sectors, including the pharmaceutical, chemical and consumer products industries. \" Dr Cathy Vickers Programme Manager for NC3Rs www.aber.ac.uk/en/university/institutes/impacs/ www.moleculomics.com 4 advances advances advances walesNEWS NEWS4 Carmarthenshire-based medical device manufacturer The Magstim Company Ltd is celebrating 25 years of business.

Professor Hays along with his Swansea University colleague Dr Sabrina Fossette tracked the movements of the jellyfish with GPS loggers Research shows barrel jellyfish aren't just drifters (as featured in Advances 69) and used GPS-tracked floats to record the current flows. They also directly observed the swimming direction of large numbers of jellyfish at the surface of the ocean. Published in the Cell Press journal Current Biology, this data shows that jellyfish can actively swim at counter-current in response to drift and their model of the jellyfishes' behaviour and ocean currents helps to explain how jellyfish are able to form blooms including hundreds to millions of individuals for periods up to several months. While jellyfish do play an important role in ocean ecosystems as prey for leatherback sea turtles and other animals, Hays noted, they can also clog fishing nets and sting beachgoers and so understanding the distribution of jellyfish in the open ocean may be practically useful for predicting and avoiding troublesome jellyfish blooms. \"Now that we have shown this remarkable behaviour by one species, we need to see how broadly it applies to other species of jellyfish,\" Hays said. \"This will allow improved management of jellyfish blooms.\" A 'robotic orchestra' built by staff at Aberystwyth University's Department of Computer Science was invited to take part in the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures which were started by Michael Faraday in 1825.

This is a new role for this gene, making it a potential therapeutic target. \" Professor Baird Institute of Cancer and Genetics Cardiff UniversityScientists have long known that chromosomal defects occur as cells repeatedly divide and that over time, these defects are linked to the onset of cancer.genes in human cells and then studying the impact on telomere fusion, the researchers found that the cells escaped death only when the gene Ligase 3 was active but not when its action, which appears to promote fusion within like chromosomes rather than between different chromosomes, was blocked. \"Telomere dysfunction has been identified in many human cancers, and as we have shown previously, short telomeres can predict the outcome of patients with the condition (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) and probably many other tumour types,\" stated Professor Baird. \"Thus, the discovery that Ligase 3 is required for this process is fundamentally important,\" he added. This research was made possible by a chance meeting between Cardiff's Professor Baird and Professor Eric Hendrickson from the University of Minnesota at an international conference as once the pair discovered that they were both looking at the role of Ligase 3 in cancer, they decided to collaborate.\"The collaboration paid off as we were able to uncover something that neither one of us could have done on our own,\" Professor Hendrickson said. Additional studies are already underway and in particular, the reliance on Ligase 3 appears, in turn, to be dependent upon the activity of another key DNA repair gene, p53. \"Since p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer, it now behoves us to discover how these two genes are interacting and to see if we can't use that information to develop synergistic treatment modalities,\" added Professor Hendrickson. Professor Baird and colleagues from the Cardiff School of Medicine are in the process of commercialising their telomere testing technology, to provide high resolution prognostic information for cancer patients, healthcare providers and the pharmaceutical industry. As cells in the body divide their telomeres \u2014 the DNA \"caps\" which protect the ends of chromosomes from damage \u2014 shorten, leaving the chromosomes vulnerable to sticking to each other.

These new cells are involved with promoting a specific form of memory which is impaired in ageing and neurodegenerative disease. The stomach hormone, ghrelin, was identified in 1999 as an important factor released from an empty stomach to trigger hunger. As mild calorie restriction has a beneficial effect on brain function, including improving memory and reducing the incidence of brain disease such as dementia, the researchers questioned whether this hunger hormone may be responsible for some of these beneficial effects. They tested whether administering Profile Product Ghrelin Applications Treating memory-related disease Contact Dr Jeffrey Davies Associate Professor College of trigger brain stem cells (cells that have the ability to become any cell type) to turn into nerve cells and whether it also affected memory function. Their findings showed that daily injections of ghrelin triggered stem cells to form new nerve cells in the learning centre of the adult brain - the hippocampus. These new nerve cells became involved with controlling the specific form of memory which is impaired in ageing and neurodegenerative disease. Through the testing, they showed that those which had been treated with this hormone had significant improvements in this 'pattern-separation' memory. In short, this hormone may prove useful to combat both age- related cognitive decline and dementia which are predicted to increase significantly in the coming years. Current drugs are lacking and recent attempts to develop new therapies for Alzheimer's disease have stalled. Therefore, it has become vitally important to look at new ways to tackle the disease. This most recent finding is particularly interesting as it suggests that finding ways to increase ghrelin in the blood, rather than in the brain, may have a therapeutic benefit. Dr Davies added that, \"From a drug-discovery perspective, identifying a valid peripheral target to combat a brain disorder would have significant benefits for the development of new drugs.\" The researchers will now test whether the hormone is protective in pre-clinical models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and they are also analysing the levels of ghrelin in the blood of people suffering from mild cognitive impairment and dementia.For more information please circle 7502 on the reader reply cardThe research - 'The orexigenic hormone acyl-ghrelin increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis and enhances pattern separation'- is published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology, the Official Journal of the International Society of Psychoneuroendocrinology.

At the time this was a radical proposition, as traditionally venom was believed to have multiple origins, but the Toxicofera hypothesis became widely accepted and had never actually been tested, until now. Researchers in the School of Biological Sciences at Bangor University used cutting-edge DNA sequencing technology to study gene expression in the venom and the salivary glands, as well as several other body tissues, from a range of venomous and non-venomous reptiles in order to test the robustness of this Toxicofera hypothesis. The research of Bangor PhD student Adam Hargreaves and his supervisor Dr John Mulley, together with colleagues at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences at Aberystwyth University, found that the Toxicofera hypothesis is not supported by this new data, prompting a return to the traditional hypothesis that venom evolved at least twice in reptiles. \"We are very interested in the evolution of venom, which everyone thought had evolved only a single time early on in reptile evolution\", explains Adam Hargreaves. \"However, when we started looking at the data, we found no evidence to back this up. Instead it looks like many genes used in support of the Toxicofera hypothesis are normal maintenance or \"housekeeping\" genes, and not toxins. Taking that into account, the inevitable conclusion is that venom has evolved more than once in reptiles, and that previous studies were overreaching in their claims.\"ew research from Bangor University, in North Wales, which disproves the theory that venom evolved just once in reptiles could also lead to new medical treatments to counteract snakebite. This discovery has profound implications for how the evolution of venom is understood, and also for the design of new medical treatments to counteract snakebite. Dr John Mulley explains, \"Ruling out so many of the proposed toxins as actual components of venom means that snake venom is far simpler than was previously suggested, with the majority of venom complexity limited to just a few gene families. It seems likely therefore that we can develop more effective antivenom treatments which focus on combatting the effects of just these families.\" Fundamentally, this new research demonstrates the power of advanced DNA sequencing technologies to shed new light on old questions, and in this case to overturn well established hypotheses regarding the evolution of venom in reptiles. The research was supported by the Royal Society, the Wellcome Trust and the Biosciences, Environment and Agriculture Alliance between Bangor and Aberystwyth universities, with analyses carried out using High Performance Computing (HPC) Wales infrastructure.

This method can be used to identify and track rare cell types, such as cancer cells, in large populations. Working in collaboration with colleagues from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA), the Institute for Materials Research at Leeds University, and GE Healthcare, The Maynard Centre, Cardiff, the team found one of the key advantages of their method is that the cells 'choose' their own barcode depending on their physical state and therefore cancer cell barcodes appear different from healthy cells when examined through high-throughput microscope imaging.The team have demonstrated this unique method of labelling cells by colour-coding and generating a large number of unique digital codes, which enables them to immediately see a cell's identity and allows for the tracking of single human cells. The new method works because cells absorb nanoparticles as they take up nutrients from any surrounding fluid and then encapsulate them in a protective membrane, which means they do not appear to alter the cells' behaviour. By introducing three different colours of nanoparticle to the cell population the colour pattern generated is unique enough to act as a barcode allowing Profile Product Method of coding cells Applications Tracking rare cell types Contact Professor Paul Rees College of each individual cell in a large population. Also as the number of nanoparticles in the cell does not change, the same cell can be identified after much longer time periods than has previously been possible. As the number of nanoparticles that a cell takes up is dependent on the cell state this method allows the identification of mutated cells in a large population because the barcode of these cells will have a different pattern than healthy cells. This is a significant step in the development of tools to study the evolution of large cell populations. Looking ahead, this method will allow researchers to observe the progression of individual cells to a cancerous state or to study the evolution of stem cells into the mature cells that make up the human body.

With print, paper and packaging rollers operating at increasingly high speeds, possibly in contact with static generating substrates, the risk of VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) ignition due to sparking, and of subsequent factory fires in the industry sector, has become significantly increased. Kalexite's anti-static properties reduce this risk of sparking and subsequent ignition and in developing the product, technologists used a recently introduced grade of base-polymer to produce a formulation matching the Eltex GNN75 requirement for printing efficiency which measures resistance of a material to penetration of a spring loaded needle-like indenter and connectivity. Cwmbran-based manufacturing company has created a new material which could make the packaging and print industry markedly safer. Achieving these targets took 44 formulatory evolutions and attaining the required electrical specification within the framework of a manufacturing-friendly, financially viable product proved to be challenging. This was due to the fact that the maximum possible electrical conductivity of the base polymer was required and so blending with any quantities of non-conductive additives was unacceptable. Traditionally, High-hardness implies higher filler and curative loadings as well as an associated increase in material sg (specific gravity). These factors would work to diminish a polymer compound's electrical viability whilst also acting to increase the overall weight of the final product. Added to these conventional concerns, the Kalexite material needed to be unusually resilient, as it would be expected to perform faultlessly in both mechanically and chemically arduous environments. Navigating these, and other design obstacles, in search of an optimum product solution proved a worthy challenge for the company asthe resulting material has the potential for a multitude of uses within a wide range of printing, mechanical handling, and film packaging-based applications and is considered to be the next generation of multi- purpose, multifunctional, future-ready rubber compounds. The material is an exemplary example of KV Rollers' ability to reverse engineer and create precisely formulated matches for technically advanced applications and the Kalexite-based roll coatings have already been adopted by industry giants such as 3M. KV Rollers' Director Kevin Lower said the material, which was the result of hundreds of man hours in the lab and in production, has \"the potential to revolutionise the print and packaging industries.\" \"As well as being a potential boon to safety Kalexite is proving its worth as far as performance quality and longevity too, which has an impact upon manufacturing costs and, importantly, upon profit margins.

The resulting computational platform, the first of its kind in the world, facilitates faster and more reliable antimicrobial development programmes. The technology is based upon the ability of Moleculomics to accurately predict the 3D structure of the proteins of multiple bacterial genomes, including variant proteins (also known as resistance mutations). The resulting protein models are then applied to a High Throughput Screening process whereby each and every protein is screened against a set of 25,000 chemical compounds (which could be later developed into drugs) to assess the binding affinity between the protein and the drug. This process was assisted by 1024 compute cores of HPC Wales, allowing for over 3 million affinity dockings with specific sets of biologically important and structurally notable proteins to be undertaken in a matter of weeks. Developed with input from Dstl, the resulting technology platform facilitates the addressing of questions driven by the scientific interests of the end users themselves. A significant capacity of this new technology is the ability to identify targets across a range of bacterial organisms for the potential development of broad spectrum antibacterials, as well as to identify common structural sites encoded by different genes in the same organism which will reduce the prospects of future antimicrobial resistance. oleculomics, based in Swansea, in South Wales, has collaborated with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) to produce an innovative new platform to assist in the development of novel antimicrobials.

Dr Roger Santer is a scientist and lecturer in Zoology at the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS), Aberystwyth University, and he has taken a novel approach to understanding how the tsetse flies see coloured visual baits, and why they are attracted to different colours. Previous studies have tried to determine the best colour for visual baits by relating their light reflectance properties to their attractiveness to tsetse. However, as Dr Santer explains, \"the key to optimising these visual baits may be to look at them through the eyes of a tsetse fly.\" The eyes of flies and Profile Product Coloured bait Applications Control of tsetse flies and other insects Contact Dr Roger Santer Lecturer in ZoologyInstitute of Biological, Environmental & Rural types and numbers of photoreceptors (sensory cells which respond to different wavelengths of light reflected from an object like a visual bait), and this means that they do not perceive colours in the same way. \"By understanding the mechanism that causes tsetse flies to be attracted to visual baits, we can select colours for visual baits that most strongly activate that mechanism. By doing that, we should be able to catch more tsetse and better control the spread of sleeping sickness. \" Dr Roger Santer the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS) Aberystwyth UniversityA fly's eye contains five different types of photoreceptor which each respond most strongly to a different wavelength of light. Colour perceptions are based upon the relative responses of these photoreceptors. Humans, meanwhile, perceive colour based upon the responses of only three different kinds of photoreceptor. The novelty in Dr Santer's work was that he calculated the excitation of each fly photoreceptor type by the visual baits used to catch tsetse flies in three previous field studies. Effectively, he worked out the fly's eye view of these visual baits and he then used these calculated photoreceptor excitations to work out what attracted tsetse flies to visual baits. He found that tsetse fly attraction could be explained by a simple mechanism in the fly's nervous system that compares the relative excitations of three different photoreceptor types.

Learning shown to be possible even during this very early developmental stage esearchers at Aberystwyth University, in Mid Wales, have shown that when snails are exposed to the smell of a predator as an embryo they are better able to avoid predatory fish once they hatch. Pond snails are central to freshwater environments, helping to control the growth of plants which can clog up our rivers and they are also under threat from invasive predators including the killer shrimp and signal crayfish. Understanding how these snails are able to learn about predators at different life stages, from embryo to adult, gives a good indication about how capable they may be of surviving under these increasingly risky conditions. In order to get an idea of how snails respond to predators, the team at Aberystwyth looked at how pond snails, Lymnaea stagnalis, responded to the smell from a predatory fish, tench. The snails were exposed to the smell of this predator throughout their embryonic development in egg capsules and once they hatched out, they were kept in a predator- free environment for a week, and then tested Profile Product Embryo research Applications Pre-programmed response Contact Dr Sarah Dalesman Lecturer in Freshwater BiologyInstitute of Biological, Environmental & Rural the predator smell. Those snails which had been exposed to the predator smell as embryos strongly responded to the smell when they re-encountered it as juveniles, reacting by crawling out of the water to escape the potential predator. Dr Sarah Dalesman, Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellow at Aberystwyth University, said, \"We were quite surprised at how well the snails were able to learn during this very early phase of development.\" The ability to respond to potential predators while still in the egg may be extremely important in allowing the young vulnerable snails to survive and Dr Dalesman added, \"We also found embryos exposed to the predator smell hatched out at a smaller size than those kept in predator-free conditions.\" This discovery mirrors the effects of stress on development in mammals, including humans, where foetuses of stressed mothers are often smaller at birth than their non-stressed counterparts. Teams from the University of Exeter and University of Plymouth were also involved in the research and Dr Simon Rundle (University of Plymouth) stated that, \"One of the most important findings in this study was that there appeared to be a genetic component to the snails' behaviour, with those animals whose grandparents had experienced fish predators in the wild showing the biggest response.\" These findings have shown that pond snails are able to sense chemicals released by their predators whilst they are still embryos in the egg and then alter their behaviour accordingly. This 'pre-programmed' response proves extremely important for snails to be able to survive just after hatching when they are very small and at their most vulnerable.For more information please circle 7508 on the reader reply cardProfile This research work was funded by a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship (Dr. Dalesman) and an undergraduate student scholarship from the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour (Angharad Thomas).

The wet summers of recent years have seen all attempts to grow tasty tomatoes outdoors in the UK decimated and with the spores being carried on the wind, tomato blight can spread for many miles. The infected plants begin to rot, starting with the leaves and stems and then spreading into the fruits. The disease can be treated by chemicals but these are not available to the amateur gardener to use and although some blight resistant tomatoes are already available, until now none have been able to fight off all strains of the disease. light-resistant tomatoes which will grow outside have been developed by Bangor University in North Wales as part of a collaborative project. Bangor University has been working with the S\u00e1rv\u00e1ri Research Trust and experienced tomato breeder, Simon Crawford and his company, Burpee Europe to develop the new hardy variety under a Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarships (KESS) Programme. The research involved identifying the exact genes responsible for making the tomato plants blight resistant and then making crosses to transfer them using non-GM selection methods. The Ph-2 and Ph-3 genes, which originate from wild tomato plants, confer resistance to the pathogen Phytophthora infestans, better known as blight, so the strains of the disease that each of the genes confer resistance to do not have an effect on the plant. Identifying and selecting the molecular markers responsible for the traits sought has speeded up the selection and development of the new plant, to produce a commercially viable new variety of hardy tomato which produces good quality fruit but has natural resistance to blight. The successful results have led to the creation of this new tomato, Crimson Crush, which is available now. As well as being able to survive even the worst attack of blight, Crimson Crush is claimed to produce exceptionally fine tasting, large round tomatoes- each weighing up to 200g. \"Outdoor grown tomatoes, when you can grow them, are delicious and tasty as they've grown in direct sunlight.

The T y Unnos system is formed from two principal components; box beams and ladder beams. In addition to these standard timber joists, plywood or OSB (Oriented Strand Board) sheathing and connections are used. The T y Unnos box beam is a rectangular hollow section formed from four solid timber sections jointed with glued joints. These solid timber sections can be jointed in the length of the beam to create beams longer than standard timber sizes and the web pieces can also be jointed along the length of the beam to create deeper beams. The hollow section is very light and strong, comparing favourably with solid timber and glulam (glued laminated timber). The name T y Unnos, or house in a night, stems from an old Welsh tradition which has parallels in other folk traditions in other areas of the British Isles. Going Wales has 150,000 hectares of coniferous plantations which produce around a million tonnes of softwood in the round per annum. Over 70% of current production is Sitka spruce, a native of the Pacific coast of North America which suits Wales' mild, wet climate and peaty upland soils. In its native range, Sitka spruce grows slowly to a great age. Welsh spruce grows much faster producing timber of lower density with heavier branching and larger knots. It is seldom used in modern timber frame construction which normally utilises higher grades of imported C24 or TR26 softwood. Although Welsh spruce has poorer structural properties than imported softwoods, it is its tendency to twist during drying that timber frame manufacturers cite as their reason for not using it but this system overcomes that. The T y Unnos system has been tested, developed and refined through a series of real design projects which consider parameters such as economic and environmental performance. In all, thirty buildings have been completed and a number are in the pipeline. Initial interest in the T y Unnos system yielded a number of challenging projects including an Environmental Research Classroom at Ebbw Vale, a T y Unnos based on a traditional Welsh longhouse in Ebbw Vale and a studio at The Old Sawmill, Tregynon. The first commercial application was a group of four 3-bed houses built by Elements Europe Ltd at Dolwyddelan in Snowdonia in 2010. These were delivered to site as fully fitted volumetric units. They were designed to meet the highest performance standards at the time but subsequent monitoring of energy and water use has shown that their actual performance far exceeds that design.Profile Product New housing construction method Applications High performance affordable housing Contact David Jenkins Director Coed Cymru Cyf Grown softwood is a challenging raw material to work with but we do have a lot of it. By accepting that it is very different and working from the first principles of design the team has achieved all its original aspirations and much more. I am very grateful to all the team members and our sponsors. \" David Jenkins, Director, Coed Cymru back to the seventeenth century, it was believed by some that if a person could build a house on common land in one night then the land belonged to them as a freehold. Other variations on this tradition were that the test was to have a fire burning in the hearth by the following morning or that the squatter could extend the land around the building by the distance that they could throw an axe from the four corners of the house.These projects provided a wide range of learning outcomes to aid in the development and refinement of this commercially applicable construction system. The portfolio of completed projects is varied and impressive though the engineers and architects working with the system have identified further capacity in the system to achieve longer spans.
