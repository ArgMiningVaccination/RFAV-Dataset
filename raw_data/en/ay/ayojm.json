Prana Purpose 55 min | $165 Healing Session with Krystia Rae Prana is the vital energy of the Universe that flows through all life forms through the breath. Prana Therapy is an ancient healing technique that involves channeling life force energy (Prana). During a Prana Therapy session, a trained practitioner uses a specific technique to connect the client to Prana energy, then the practitioner facilitates a transfer of this energy into the clients energy field and body. This is a very powerful energy transmission. Most clients will feel the energy moving through them while they are guided into a deeply relaxed state where healing on all levels can occur. Recommended treatments of once per week for the first two months while old patterns and habits are released, then once every other week or once a month to maintain your new healthy habits, patterns and frequencies is most effective. Reiki 60 min | $165 Book your Reiki session with: Krystia, Gabriella, or Sarah Reiki is a hands on healing therapy where life force is transferred through the hands of a trained practitioner into the client's energy field and body. This is a very gentle holistic therapy that can offer profound healing. The energy of reiki guides the client into a deeply relaxed state where healing on all levels can occur. Reiki can be beneficial for healing on physical, emotional and energetic levels as reiki works to address blockages and imbalances in the body and energetic field that can contribute to discomfort or dis-ease physically manifesting in the body. Reiki also works within the quantum field, providing healing to both our conscious and subconscious awareness. Through this modality of energy work we are able to address anything in your present life that needs healing, and we are also able to work with healing past experiences of this lifetime and other lifetimes. As you arrive for your session you will have space to speak with your healer about your intentions and anything you are currently moving through in your healing journey. After your session you will have time to integrate your experience and reflect with your healer on anything that came up during your session. Reiki 60 min | $175 90 min $240 with Gianna Rielle Smith Reiki is a gentle yet powerful energy medicine that offers profound healing on all levels: the physical body, emotional body, and spiritual body. Reiki allows for healing on both conscious and subconscious levels, providing the opportunity to heal present and past life trauma, and break generational patterns. Reiki eliminates energetic blockages, brings harmony to energetic imbalances within the body, and provides a sense of clarity, relaxation, stress reduction, and a positive mental state. Energy healing sessions with Gianna are non-traditional and personalized to what you need in the present moment, therefore no session will be exactly the same. Healing sessions with her include various healing modalities including powerful shamanic healing techniques, crystal healing, sound healing (sound bowls, rattles, shamanic drumming, rain sticks, vocal activations), acupressure, and aura clearings. Gianna provides a safe, loving, and sacred container to explore and deepen our inner work providing lasting and profound changes and allowing you to step into the best version of yourself while tapping into your inner wisdom. At the end of your session, you will have time to reflect and integrate your experience while also receiving tools to continue your healing journey after your session to maintain your health and wellness. Gianna is also incredibly intuitive and may receive channeled messages to share while working with you. Cranial Sacral + Visceral Manipulation 60 min | $225 90 min | $295 with Dr. Hannah Lollar Cranial sacral therapy (CST) is a gentle but powerful modality that has proven beneficial for a variety of conditions. The cranial sacral system consists of the skull, the cranial sutures, the cerebrospinal fluid, membranes of the brain and vertebrae, spinal cord and the sacrum. The cranial sacral system is the central pillar of our body, allowing the spinal fluids (also our life force energy) to flow. Trauma anywhere in the body can impact this system restricting the flow of our spinal fluids and our life force energy. Visceral manipulation is another gentle, hands-on therapy used to help your internal organs glide smoothly within your body and return to their proper place and functioning. In your session, Dr Hannah will utilize both of these techniques to address any mental, emotional and physical ailments you are currently experiencing. She also has an incredible gift for receiving messages while working on the body so will often have intuitions and channeled messages to share with you about what is going on in your body and in your life. Homeopathy + Flower Essence Consultation 75 min | $250 30 min | $150 with Dr. Hannah Lollar Homeopathy, also known as homeopathic medicine, is a medical system that was developed in Germany over 200 years ago. It's based on two unconventional theories: \"Like cures like\" - the notion that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people. \"Law of minimum dose\" - the notion that the lower the dose of the medication, the greater its effectiveness. Many homeopathic products are so diluted that no molecules of the original substance remain. Homeopathy is a practice of medicine that embraces a holistic, natural approach to the treatment of a variety of conditions. Homeopathy is holistic because it treats the person as a whole, rather than focusing on a diseased part or a labeled sickness. The idea is that this practice helps stimulate the immune system and the body's natural ability to heal. One of the most important principles of homeopathic medicine is that treatments must be \"individualized\" and tailored to each person's specific symptoms, history, body and needs. Even if two people are battling the same illness, they can receive completely different recommendations from their homeopathic doctors based on their unique situation and how their body would be expected to respond. What makes homeopathy very different from conventional medicine is that a patient's emotions and personality are highly important. It's common for a homeopathic doctor to talk in depth with a patient about their stress levels, relationships, personal characteristics, family and so on. Flower essences, or flower remedies, are infusions made from the flowering part of a plant. The process of sun steeping, or boiling the flower in water, captures the energetic imprint of the flower. So, unlike essential oils or herbal remedies, which contain physical substances extracted from plants, there is no physical part of the flower in a flower essence, only its healing vibration. And, every flower has a different healing quality. Flower essences offer a wonderful way to heal and grow because they act as catalysts for change at a deep emotional level. The positive changes that can occur from using flower essences include feeling more confident and creative, experiencing more joy, being more forgiving, forging better relationships, having more clarity and focus and even cultivating a deeper connection to your Higher Self. During your session, Dr. Hannah will get to know your personal history to receive the information needed to select an individualized homeopathic remedy and combine it with a custom flower essence based on your current presentation. Each consultation includes a custom flower essence and homeopathy blend. Personal Entheobreath with Kava Ceremony + Integration 90 min | $188 5 pack | $800 First session | 20% off Group session (3-6 people) | $88 per person with Rachelle Campbell Entheobreath is a transformative healing technique that uses conscious, connected breathing to allow you to travel deep into the subconscious mind which contains all of the stored information of everything you have ever experienced. It holds the \"programs\" that control the way you think, what you believe, the way you feel, act, react, goal and dreams and whether we can achieve them or not. Entheobreath can clear any limiting beliefs and trauma stored there. It also raises your vibration to a place where dis-ease is not in resonance. Offering a more empowered and free life experience. Moving forward with more authenticity, clarity and love! We will share in a heart opening kava ceremony before our experience and kava will also be offered after to ground us into the integration process. Kava is an ancient and sacred plant that's grown on the pacific islands. It has been used ceremonially, socially and medicinally for thousands of years. Its main use is for easing stress, anxiety and depression. It's non addictive and has no side effects other than a feeling of connection and presence. It pairs beautifully with all healing modalities, especially breathwork. You will leave this session feeling more calm, connected and clear. * Please dress in comfortable clothing (For a group session, each person will need to sign up separately. Please reach out to schedule if you don't see a time that fits for you!) Fire Cupping + Gua Sha (Body) 45 min | $85 with Gianna Rielle Smith Fire cupping, also known as cupping therapy, is an alternative, painless and non-invasive treatment originating from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The treatment technique includes placing special glass cups on the skin to enhance circulation, relieve pain, and extract toxins from the body. Traditionally, fire is used to create a suction between your body and the glass cup allowing all the toxins to rise to the surface and removing them from the deeper parts of the body. The fire is removed before the cups touch the body. For stationary fire cupping, the cups are left unmoving on the skin for around 5-10 minutes, creating a suction that causes your skin to rise and redden within the cup. This process causes your blood vessels to expand, encouraging blood flow and increased circulation to the damaged, or painful areas. Another technique of fire cupping is called sliding cupping in which the glass cups will slide over the surface of the body area in need of healing once suction is created. The benefits of sliding cupping are the same as stationary cupping, though the movement of the cups is more like a deep tissue massage! Gua sha is a scraping technique also originating from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that is used to relieve muscular and joint pain, tightness, increase circulation and reduce inflammation. Oil will be applied to the skin and a gua sha tool will be used to \"scrape\" over the body area in need of healing. Your session will include all of the above techniques. Please be aware that these techniques used may result in redness or painless bruising on the body in the treated area that will go away on its own within a few days. Facial Cupping, Facial Gua Sha + Facial Roller 45 min | $85 with Gianna Rielle Smith Cupping therapy, facial gua sha and facial rolling are alternative, painless and non-invasive treatments originating from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Facial cupping, gua sha, and facial rolling all increase blood circulation and stimulate collagen production which brightens the skin, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and minimizes the appearance of scars. These techniques also tone the chin, jaw line, and neck by decreasing puffiness, drain lymph and reduce muscle tension. Your session will include ALL of the above techniques. Unlike body gua sha and cupping, the pressure of these facial techniques is very light and will not result in any redness or bruising. Add on: Ear Seeds 15 min | $20 with Gianna Rielle Smith In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) the ear is a microsystem for the entire body. This means that we can access any area of the body from the ear therefore providing healing for a multitude of conditions. Ear seeds are small stickers with tiny seeds on the back which allows for the stimulation of specific points on the ear once stuck on. Ear seeds are painless and enable the wearer to get the benefit of continued healing throughout the day or the next couple days, depending on when the ear seeds are taken off or fall off naturally. The wearer can also press on the point throughout the day to re-stimulate the point(s) on the ear. Some common conditions treated with ear seeds include but are not limited to: sleep irregularities, headaches, cutting back on cravings (food, drink, smoking, drug, etc), depression, anxiety, stress, immunity support, and pain. Ear seeds can be added to any service provided by Gianna if purchased in advance. "}
