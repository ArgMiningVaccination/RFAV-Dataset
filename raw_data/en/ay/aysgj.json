The Global Pain Council (GPC) has announced that Dr Nathanael Lutevele from Tanzania is the first recipient of its scholarship competition for a veterinarian with an interest in pain management. The scholarship is part of its 'Teach the Teachers' initiative which aims to create a global network of key opinion leader (KOLs) - 'teachers' - in pain management, who are motivated to propagate and disseminate their knowledge within their regions. Nathanael Lutevele graduated from Sokoine University of Agriculture in Tanzania in 2018 and worked as small animal general practitioner in Dar es salaam, Tanzania, for six months. He is currently a tutor at the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources in Dar es salaam. He is an active member of WSAVA member association Tanzania Small Animal Veterinary Organization (TASAVO). In Phase One of the GPC Scholarship, Nathanael will travel to Montreal, Canada, to receive 8-12 weeks of training in small animal pain management from members of the GPC. In Phase Two, he will return to Tanzania and run courses on pain management to local veterinarians or veterinary technicians/nurses and their WSAVA member association's members. Commenting on the award of the Scholarship, GPC Member Dr Beatriz Monteiro says: We hope our Teach the Teachers program will lay the foundations of a global network of veterinarians and veterinary technicians/nurses with specific expertise in pain management and the passion and knowledge to educate their colleagues. Nathanael stood out among many outstanding applications and we look forward to welcoming him to Montreal when the current emergency has ended. Nathanael Lutevele says: When I received the email saying that I had been selected as the first Scholar, I was astonished. I am happy that I will gain knowledge which will not only benefit me as an individual but which I can also teach on my return home. I will work with TASAVO to ensure that my knowledge is propagated to my fellow members, to the students whom I teach at the college and to fellow veterinary practitioners in my country, and Africa in general.
