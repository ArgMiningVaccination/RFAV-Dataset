The mission of the VRC is to discover and develop both vaccines and antibody-based products that target infectious diseases. [[1]](#cite_note-1) The broad research portfolio of the VRC includes basic, clinical, and translational[ [clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)] research into vaccines for [HIV](/wiki/HIV), other viruses, [[2]](#cite_note-2) antibodies](/wiki/Therapeutic_antibodies) against [SARS-CoV-2](/wiki/SARS-CoV2) and other pathogens. [[3]](#cite_note-Philippidis2020-3) History[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vaccine_Research_Center&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] The origins of the Vaccine Research Center date back to 1996 following discussions between [President Bill Clinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton) and [NIAID](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases) Director [Dr. Anthony Fauci](/wiki/Anthony_Fauci) regarding research addressing HIV/AIDS. Recognizing the potential impact a vaccine could make in decreasing the global public health burden of HIV, President Clinton in 1997 announced a plan to establish an HIV vaccine research center on the [NIH](/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health) campus. [[4]](#cite_note-4) The dedication ceremony for the VRC took place in 1999 with President Clinton delivering the opening remarks. [[5]](#cite_note-5) Named in honor of immunization advocates former [Governor of Arkansas](/wiki/Governor_of_Arkansas) [Dale Bumpers](/wiki/Dale_Bumpers) and his wife [Betty Flanagan Bumpers](/wiki/Betty_Bumpers), the Vaccine Research Center opened its doors as Building 40 on the NIH campus in 2000. [[6]](#cite_note-6) The founding investigators leading the new center came from a range of scientific disciplines including virology, immunology, structural biology, bioengineering, manufacturing, clinical research and regulatory science. While HIV vaccine research and development remains a core focus, the scope of activities has expanded to include advancing scientific understanding and developing biologics for a broad array of infectious pathogens. Leadership: 2000 2012 The VRC is composed of an Office of the Director, basic research laboratories and major programs. Office of the Director: - Management and Operations - Scientific Partnerships and Collaborations - Strategic Planning Laboratories: - Immunology Laboratory [[9]](#cite_note-:0-9) - Cellular Immunology Section - Flow Cytometry Core - The Genome Analysis Core - Human Immunology Section - Immunology Section - ImmunoTechnology Section - Integrative Bioinformatics of Immune Systems Core - Nonhuman Primate Immunogenicity Core - Pandemic Response Repository through Microbial and Immune Surveillance and Epidemiology (PREMISE) - Tissue Analysis Core - Virus Persistence and Dynamics Section - Virology Laboratory [[10]](#cite_note-:1-10) - Humoral Immunology Core - Humoral Immunology Section - Structural Bioinformatics Core - Structural Biology Section - Virology Core - Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory [[11]](#cite_note-:2-11) - Biodefense Research Section - Molecular ImmunoEngineering Section - Translational Science Core - Yeast Engineering Technology and Immunobiology Core Programs: - Clinical Trials Program [[12]](#cite_note-12) - Regulatory Science and Strategy Program - Translational Research Program [[13]](#cite_note-13) - Vaccine Immunology Program [[14]](#cite_note-14) - Vaccine Production Program Research Areas[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vaccine_Research_Center&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] To advance scientific understanding of infectious pathogens and develop investigational biologics, the VRC maintains programs in the following: Key scientific areas [[11]](#cite_note-:2-11) [[10]](#cite_note-:1-10) [[9]](#cite_note-:0-9): - Disease acquisition and viral pathogenesis - Infection and vaccine-induced immune responses - Structure-based vaccine design - Structural basis for antibody-mediated virus neutralization - Vaccine antigens, antibody platforms, and routes of delivery Primary Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) - HIV/AIDS - Influenza - Malaria - Nipah Virus - Paramyxoviruses (Parainfluenza Virus and Human Metapneumovirus) - Respiratory Syncytial Tuberculosis - Zika Virus Projects[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vaccine_Research_Center&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] HIV[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vaccine_Research_Center&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] In July 2010, a collaboration between the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases) and officials at the Vaccine Research Center found that two human HIV antibodies, named [VRC01](/w/index.php?title=VRC01&action=edit&redlink=1) and [VRC03](/w/index.php?title=VRC03&action=edit&redlink=1), could potentially be used against a wide range of types and mutations of HIV in the design of a preventive HIV vaccine for human use, as well as in the formation of better antiretroviral therapy drug cocktails. The discovery, a potentially landmark one in the drive to find a vaccine for AIDS should it be validated and further improved. Ebola[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vaccine_Research_Center&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] In 2016 research efforts led by [Nancy Sullivan](/wiki/Nancy_Sullivan_(scientist)) at Vaccine Research Center and [J. J. Muyembe-Tamfum](/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Muyembe-Tamfum) from the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in the [Democratic Republic of Congo](/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo) resulted in the discovery of a [monoclonal antibody](/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody), [mAb114](/wiki/MAb114), from a survivor from the [Ebola virus disease](/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease). [[15]](#cite_note-:02-15) [[16]](#cite_note-:52-16) mAb114 is a [monoclonal antibody therapy](/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody_therapy) that is being evaluated as a treatment for [Ebola virus disease](/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease) and has shown great success by lowering the mortality rate from 70% to about 34% in the [2018-2020 Kivu Ebola Virus Outbreak](/wiki/2018%E2%80%9320_Kivu_Ebola_epidemic). In August 2019, Congolese health authorities, the World Health Organization, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health promoted the use of mAb114, alongside a similar [Regeneron](/wiki/Regeneron)-produced treatment, over other treatments yielding higher mortality rates, after ending [clinical trials](/wiki/Clinical_trial) during the outbreak. references[ Research Center Mission and History | NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\"](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/vaccine-research-center-mission-and-history).
