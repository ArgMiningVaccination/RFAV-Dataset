In some cases, yes, but time is of the essence and you have to be prepared AHEAD of time. If on the day your throat starts itching or gets sore or you feel other symptoms, and you don't have the right resources available, things may get worse quickly and develop into full blown sickness. The moment you notice symptoms, you have to strike hard and give your body/immune system what it needs in order to reduce symptoms fast. I personally have used this information to avoid getting a full blown cold for the last 11 years. When I have noticed the beginning stages of symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, sore throat), I have dealt with things so swiftly and powerfully that symptoms go away in a day or two. So here is exactly what I would do. - Stop eating foods that are on The Nasty Nine list immediately. These foods include dairy, wheat, corn, soy, alcohol, fried food, pork, eggs and alcohol. These foods will weaken immunity and will burden your system. You need all available resources to battle the virus. - Make sure you have a 2 or more bottles of powdered vitamin C on hand at all times. If you don't have this stocked in your house, make sure you get it right now - [NOW C Complex Powder](https://amzn.to/2mpoSGs). Cold and flu season occurs during the winter months (especially January and February), but you actually can get sick at anytime now due to living in a global society. - Upon noticing the first symptoms, take 10,000 milligrams of vitamin C at once. One teaspoon equals roughly 5,000 milligrams (or 5 grams). Many people awaken in the morning and notice symptoms immediately. When this happens, take the vitamin C immediately. These amounts are for adults, not children. - Take 1 tsp (5,000 milligrams) every hour or two until you notice symptoms starting to go away. - If you start to get gas, bloating or eventually loose stools (diarrhea), then you know you are reaching saturation of vitamin C at that moment. This does NOT mean you stop taking it, but you wait to give your body a chance to catch up to the amount you have taken. Wait 2 hours and take either another \u00bd teaspoon (around 2,500 milligrams) or 1 teaspoon every hour while you are awake or until you notice yourself reaching saturation again. Continue taking these high amounts of vitamin C until all symptoms disappear. I have safely taken 100,000 milligrams multiple days in a row when I got the flu in the past. Make sure you continue to drink ample amounts of water throughout the day. - Vitamin C is completely safe to take in large amounts. It is a water soluble vitamin and whatever your body doesn't need it will easily get rid of. It will also not cause problems with your kidneys. - At the same time you start taking vitamin C, also incorporate [Good State Liquid Zinc Sulfate.](https://amzn.to/2RGNIPA)Take 2 droppers full of this every four hours for three days. After 3 days, take 1 dropper full per day until symptoms go away. Again, it is critical to have this at home BEFORE symptoms appear. Be prepared. Vitamin C and zinc are two of the most powerful stimulators of the immune system available. I have seen them work miracles with people when they are acutely or chronically ill. You can get rid of the cold in one day by using these two amazing supplements. They are also powerful anti-inflammatory agents and can help deal with any inflammation in the body that may be present with other health issues you struggle with. FAQS Where can I find articles that talk more about megadoses for vitamin C? Here are a couple of articles that you can read for kidney stones taking high amounts of vitamin C? No, this is a very pesky myth that is not true. See this article about [ vitamin C and stones](http://doctoryourself.com/kidney.html) and do more research to decide for yourself. What if I already have full blow cold/flu symptoms? It is recommended to take anywhere between 1-10,000 milligrams of vitamin C per hour, depending upon what brings you close to bowel tolerance (loose stools). If you are taking 4,000 milligrams per hour and after 3 hours you are getting lots of gas and slight loose stools, then lower the amount to 1,000 milligrams per hour or whatever is necessary to avoid bowel tolerance. If you haven't reached bowel tolerance in a few hours of taking a good hourly dose, then up the dosage. If you are an adult, you may need in excess of 50 or 100k milligrams to reach bowel tolerance per day. Pay attention to your body. Vitamin C is very safe. Here is a titration chart for adults about bowel tolerance levels for various things (1 gram = 1,000 milligrams): Can I take vitamin C daily when I'm not sick with a cold/flu? Yes. Many people take between 3,000-10,000 milligrams every day. The recommended daily amount right now per day is only 90mg, which is not very much. Many animals have the ability to produce vitamin C naturally. Some believe that we need a minimum of 5-10k milligrams per day because we used to be able to produce it naturally in our body. Over the course of time, we may have lost this ability. Vitamin C is such a powerful antioxidant that does so many incredible things in the body. It is also one of the main things that keeps the immune system strong. Can you do intravenous Vitamin C? Yes. Intravenous vitamin C is very powerful. It is also expensive because it normally requires a medical doctor to administer it ($75-175 per session typically). If you have the means to do this and have a serious disease, I highly recommend it. Check with your holistic medical doctor. Do an internet search in your area to find a medical doctor that does intravenous vitamin C and see what they charge per session. Are amounts smaller for children? Yes. The doses can be much less than (1/2, 1/3 or even 1/4) for adults in reaching bowel tolerance. Chewable forms of vitamin C exist, but many come with nasty fillers, binders, sugar or even aspartame to make it taste sweeter. This is why powder is recommended. These things should be avoided. Whole Foods stores have a [ good vitamin C chewable for kids](https://amzn.to/2REKVXi) or try [Raw Garden Natural Liquid Vitamin C](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HU3RNUE/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=costaricannon-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01HU3RNUE&linkId=d923a7856d270fa4f32f2e28e2f9ad62) with stevia, glycerin, and a natural orange flavor. \"Links to products in this post are through Amazon's affiliate program.
