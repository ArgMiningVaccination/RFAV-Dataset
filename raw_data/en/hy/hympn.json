By [Mark Mancini](https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-mark-mancini.htm) When physicists want accelerator particles, they head to OK Quark, answer questions about what they're looking for, and hope for a match. Nah, wait ... that's not it at all. Batman and particle physicists have a lot in common. While Batman brawls with anarchist clowns and mutated ecoterrorists, CERN scientists chase down their own notable adversaries. Get to know five of them. By [Robert Lamb](https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-robert-lamb.htm) Advertisement Tour the inside of a nuclear power plant with these illustrative diagrams to learn more about how nuclear power plants work. The detonation of the world's first nuclear bomb ushered in the atomic age. It also amplified tensions between countries and sparked an era in which nations scrambled for power and seemed headed toward catastrophe. By [John Fuller](https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-john-fuller.htm) Dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended World War II. How did the most powerful weapon in the world get developed? It started with the Manhattan Project. By [John Fuller](https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-john-fuller.htm) This human-made element can power everything from nuclear weapons to deep space missions. So what's so scary about plutonium? By [Mark Mancini](https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-mark-mancini.htm) Advertisement Thorium is in many ways safer than uranium for nuclear power production. But is it safe enough to bet on for our energy future? Iran has announced its activation of a second set of uranium centrifuges. These machines are at the core of the uranium-enrichment process. Find out where the centrifuge fits into the equation. Nuclear materials get used in many forms of nuclear medicine -- everything from PET scans to chemotherapy uses them. Learn how nuclear medicine works. On the one hand, nuclear power offers a clean energy alternative that decreases fossil fuel dependence. On the other, it summons images of quake-ruptured Japanese power plants leaking radioactive water. What happens in reactors in good times and bad? Advertisement I once saw this device shaped like a light bulb. It had a vertical support inside it, and on that support there were four vanes with four diamonds on the end. One side of the diamond was black and the other was white. I did a little research and found out that it was called a Crookes' radiometer -- how does it work? Many ads for new clocks advertise their ability to automatically synchronize themselves with the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. This atomic clock is more precise because it uses the frequencies of atoms as its resonator. In the comics, radiation exposure turned an average man into a pea green and angry Incredible Hulk. But in reality, what can radiation do to those exposed? Is it always a villain? By [Debra Ronca](https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-debra-ronca.htm) If the sight of a mushroom cloud burning above the horizon suggests that the nuclear weapon-equipped world might end with a bang, then nuclear winter presents the notion that post-World War III humanity might very well die with a whimper. By [Robert Lamb](https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-robert-lamb.htm) Advertisement If you watched \"24,\" you might think real-life Jack Bauers stop bad guys from detonating stolen nukes all the time. Just how hard is it to steal a nuclear weapon? By [John Fuller](https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-john-fuller.htm) When the power goes out and is later restored, how do you know what time to set your clocks to? Have you ever wondered how time is regulated? Learn how scientists determine exact time. Nuclear radiation can be extremely beneficial or extremely harmful -- it all depends on how it's used. Learn what nuclear radiation is all about. Fusion reactors will use abundant sources of fuel, will not leak radiation above normal background levels, and will produce less radioactive waste than current fission reactors. Learn about this promising power source. By [Patrick J. Kiger](https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-patrick-j-kiger.htm) & Craig C. Freudenrich Advertisement Atom smashers tell us about the fundamental structure of matter, the forces holding it together and the origins of the universe. Discover how scientists use particle accelerators to break atoms apart to learn about the nature of reality. British authorities have found traces of polonium-210 in at least five buildings and three British Airways jets since Alexander Litvinenko fell ill. By [Julia Layton](https://www.howstuffworks.com/about-julia-layton.htm) The Large Hadron Collider isn't just a one-trick (Higgs) pony. Find out what else has happened where hundreds of millions of particles may collide any given second. Supersymmetry: the idea that the particles we know about have as-yet-underscovered force partners. Multiverse: exactly what it sounds like. Can they coexist? Advertisement When scientists announced that the Large Hadron Collider had found evidence of the Higgs boson, we cried right along with elated physicists everywhere. But ... then what? To the uninitiated, the LHC can look like a junk drawer ... a junk drawer that's full of tiny, rapidly decaying particles that move at light speed. How do scientists "}
