Sullivan, MD, professor of pediatrics, pathology, and molecular genetics &microbiology and world-renownedAIDS researcher, was recentlyhonored with a TherapeuticIntervention Special RecognitionAward at the second conference onGlobal Strategies for the Preventionof HIV Transmission from Mothersto Infants, held in Montreal. Dr.Sullivan played a key role in whathas been called possibly one of themost important breakthroughssince the AIDS virus was isolated. Sullivan and his UMMS colleague, Katherine Luzuriaga, MD, associate professor of pediatrics and medicine, were involved in thediscovery of the anti-retroviral drug nevirapine in 1989, and it was atUMass that nevirapine was firstgiven to adults and children withHIV infection two years later. This,along with Sullivan's hypothesisthat nevirapine could preventmother-to-infant transmission, laid the groundwork for furtherinvestigation of the drug. Mostnotably, the National Institute ofAllergy and Infectious Diseasesrecently sponsored a large-scaleefficacy trial in Uganda whichshowed that a short course ofnevirapine, when given to HIV-infected mothers in labor and totheir babies within three days ofbirth, can reduce the HIVtransmission rate by half. The findings signaled the first bit of hope for the 600,000 to 800,000HIV-infected infants born each year,most in the developing world whereother HIV treatment regimens arefar too expensive to be used broadly.Nevirapine costs approximately $4for the treatment course, (comparedto nearly $700 for the most commonalternative, AZT treatment) and canbe given in a single dose because itstays in the bloodstream for days. The Global Strategies Organizing Committee recognizes keyindividuals whose foresight,scientific abilities, dedication andcompassion contribute toprevention of perinatal HIVtransmission.faculty selected for review boards Leslie J.

Initiatingnew public service programs forlocal communities. Igniting interestin youth about careers in science. No one has counted them, but they\u00d5re out there: UMMS students of the School of Medicine, GraduateSchool of Nursing (GSN) andGraduate School of BiomedicalSciences (GSBS) are volunteering en masse, adding to their already brimming schedules to serve thecommunities and citizens of thecommonwealth. The \u00d2Goals and Objectives of Medical Education Leading to theMedical Degree at the University ofMassachusetts Medical School\u00d3 lists the knowledge, skills, values and attributes of a successfulmedical student. Developing anunderstanding of the doctor/patientrelationship, the needs of diversepatient populations and theeconomics of health care isenhanced through students\u00d5involvement in community service. And involved they are. Mai-Lan Rogoff, MD, associate dean ofstudent affairs, estimates that asmany as 90 percent of students havebeen volunteers at some pointduring their School of Medicineexperience, many in leadershiproles. \u00d2It starts with the kind ofstudents we pull in,\u00d3 said Dr.Rogoff. \u00d2Admissions looks forevidence of a team player with a real interest in people. One such piece of evidence is communityinvolvement.\u00d3 Case in point: Every Monday evening, medical and nursingstudents join other volunteers forthe Worcester Evening Free MedicalServices Program. They gather in the basement of Epworth UnitedMethodist Church to see everypatient who arrives throughout theevening, no appointment needed. Founded by Paul L. Hart, MD, an associate in the Department ofFamily Medicine & CommunityHealth, this was the first of severalsuch programs in the area. In thepast five years, the volunteer staffhas treated over 10,000 uninsured Student involvement in public service is a matter of course and mission. by sandra l. gray p serve 4 Vitae fall - winter 1999 Responsibility to* UMass fall / printer 4/5/00 11:18 AM Page 46 Vitae fall - winter 1999 fall - winter 1999 Vitae 7patients. Students conduct the initial interview, then consult with Dr. Hartand other volunteer providers,including nurse practitioners andphysicians. \u00d2Students get to be thepatient\u00d5s first contact, which is agreat opportunity for both learningand serving,\u00d3 said Hart. \u00d2We experience first-hand mechanisms to meet the needs ofthe underserved,\u00d3 said Lloyd Fisher,\u00d502. \u00d2It\u00d5s exciting to know I\u00d5ll beable to do this as a physician.\u00d3 Inaddition the program,David Blehar, \u00d2Scheduling iseasy because so many students wantto participate. Last year, I didn\u00d5thave enough slots for everyone,\u00d3 heenthused. Theresa Arpin, \u00d502 added, \u00d2I like the philosophy of theprogram and want to be a part of it.It\u00d5s very inspiring.\u00d3 Hart sees that inspiration in action. \u00d2Every student is compassionate,top-notch, dedicated. They show upeven when they\u00d5re preparing forexams, the night after exams and allthrough the summer. The programcouldn\u00d5t operate without them.\u00d3 Cheri Burrer, MS, NP, a 1999 graduate of the GSN, is lookingforward to returning to the programas a volunteer, reliving her dayswhen, as a student, she \u00d2workedalongside volunteers who werehappy to be a part of the program.Helping the needy confirmed myfeeling that I entered the right fieldof work,\u00d3 Burrer added. Direct clinical care is an obvious way for future caregivers to contribute,but not the only way. MarniSilverstein, \u00d502, one of three studentleaders for the Department ofPediatrics\u00d5 Book Buddies Program,enjoys reading stories to younginpatients because \u00d2kids enjoy a visitfrom someone who doesn\u00d5t doanything that hurts them.\u00d3 She feelsthe children give back as much asthey receive. \u00d2You can get caught up in studying and lose sight of why you\u00d5re in medical school.Volunteering provides perspectiveand balance.\u00d3This fall, Mandy Coles, \u00d502, a volunteer counselor for AIDS ProjectWorcester, takes over the StudentsTeaching AIDS to Students (STATS)program. With its goal of providingbasic HIV and AIDS education to10th graders in the Worcester publicschools, STATS offers Coles anopportunity to \u00d2do something thatwill make a difference even before Ibecome a doctor.\u00d3 The Division of Pediatric Endocrinology\u00d5s Juvenile DiabetesHalloween Party gets a big boostfrom student volunteers. Formernurse, School of Medicine graduateand resident Patty-Ann Krajewski,MD, wanted to help after her godsonwas diagnosed at age five. Dr.Krajewski secured donations andrecruited plenty of studentmanpower to produce an annualgala that is organized and staffedentirely by students. They come fullycostumed and ready to fete theyoung diabetics with fun, games and sugar-free treats. responsibility to serve Community service is so important at the GSN that it\u00d5s part of thecurriculum. The service requirementwas added several years ago because\u00d2nurses need to know they have aresponsibility to serve theircommunity,\u00d3 explained Dean andProfessor Lillian R. Goodman, EdD.Nurses first learn how to conduct acommunity needs assessmentthrough coursework. In their clinicalyear, they select a community,conduct an assessment and identifyservices that can be offered bymaster\u00d5s-level nurses. Carol Kerwin-Mushnick, RN, a GSN geriatric nurse practitionercandidate, planned a service help elders hometown ofMillis. Kerwin-Mushnick and projectpartner Critchlow, RN,developed thateducates seniors about the dangersof hypothermia. \u00d2No matter what I do, whether professionally orpersonally, I want it to have meaningand significance, to make adifference,\u00d3 said Kerwin-Mushnick.it\u00d5s in the campus culture All GSBS students receive a stipend to serve the commonwealth full-timeas research assistants. Such anassignment can mean 16-hourworkdays, including time spentconducting research and teaching.Yet many of these gifted scientistsembrace a more hands-on approachas volunteers. Dean Thomas B.Miller Jr., PhD, has observed thecampus culture evolve over theyears. \u00d2Under Chancellor AaronLazare\u00d5s leadership, we have becomea more caring institution. Peoplewant to help and serve theircommunity.\u00d3 For the past two years, predoctoral candidate Carlo DiBonaventura hasbeen a hit with students at NorthHigh School, where he mentors viathe Worcester Pipeline Collaborative.While the collaborative is a funded,staffed UMMS initiative, studentvolunteers of science educationprograms. DiBonaventura visitshealth classes to talk abouteducation, careers and anything elseon students\u00d5 minds. He is pleasedthat such activity \u00d2allows me to reacha lot of kids in my limited time.\u00d3 With the hope of making it easier for UMMS students and communityagencies to connect, GSBS studentLaurie Boyer and School of Medicinestudent Jennifer Keating arecollaborating to establish UMassCAREs (Community Awareness,Responsibility and Education). They envision the organization willprovide a means by which studentscampuswide can link with volunteerprograms, building on existingmethods like the annual studentactivities fair and Serving theUnderserved, a student-written grant. UMass CAREs promises to help busy medical, nursing and basicscience students squeeze in onemore commitment, make one more contribution, help one moreperson. \u00d2As individuals we want to contribute,\u00d3 Boyer summed up.\u00d2The schools help make thispossible in many ways.\u00d3 Students learn about volunteer opportunities at the medical school\u00d5s annual activities fair (above). Opportunities are put into action as students tend to patients at the Worcester Evening Free Medical Services Program.* UMass fall / printer 4/5/00 11:18 AM Page 6fall - winter 1999 Vitae 9\u00d2There is a national expectation by Congress and by the NationalInstitutes of Health that medicalschools provide leadership inresearch,\u00d3 said Chancellor and Dean Aaron Lazare, MD. \u00d2As ourresearchers continue to makediscoveries and explore new avenuesof inquiry, we recognize that inorder to continue to fulfill ourmission, our research enterprisemust grow. And in order to grow, we simply need more space.\u00d3 The new building will not only have ample space, it will have efficient space: An innovative laboratory design and layout will maximize lab bench space while providingunprecedented opportunities forcollaboration and sharing ofresources. The lab layout \u00d1described as a \u00d2linear equipment\u00d3design by GPR Planners Co-operative, which is programmingand planning the laboratories \u00d1 will attain the maximum amount Welcome w of usable research space from the structure; more than 200,000 square feet of research space whenfully fitted. Surrounding those lab benches will be a building that architectCarol Chiles AIA, the projectexecutive for Tsoi/Kobus &Associates, believes will change theimage of the campus by finishingthe \u00d2quadrangle\u00d3 implied by themedical school and hospitalbuildings. \u00d2The new building is an opportunity to create indelibly a new \u00d4first impression\u00d5 of themedical school,\u00d3 she said. \u00d2This is an exciting project forTsoi/Kobus & Associates because itis an opportunity to transform thecampus and create a building that gives something to the entirecampus through its public spacesand meeting rooms \u00d1 a buildingthat surprises people a little by beingmore than they expected.\u00d3hen the University of Massachusetts Medical Schoolbreaks ground in December on anew research laboratory building for the Worcester campus, thelandscape will change both literallyand figuratively. With 10 floors andmore than one third of a milliongross square feet, a dramatic glass\u00d2curtain wall\u00d3 overlooking theoriginal granite buildings, and a key position at the gateway to thecampus, the new building willinstantly become the signatureUMMS structure for the newmillennium. Metaphorically as well, the new laboratories will herald a change inthe research landscape \u00d1 not justfor the medical school, but for theregion and beyond. When thebuilding is fully occupied, morethan 100 principal investigators atthe cusp of great scientific changewill lead UMMS in an unprecedentedexpansion of its mission. to the research neighborhoodThe UMass research enterprise will soon have room to grow with construction of a new research laboratory building on campus. by mark l. shelton The view from Belmont andPlantation streets(left) and the view from across the \u00d2quad.\u00d3 8 Vitae fall - winter 1999* UMass fall / printer 4/5/00 11:19 AM Page 810 Vitae fall - winter 1999extended famiyby lynn c. borella The public spaces on the first and second floors are integral to thehabitability of the building. Plansinclude a walkway connecting thenew facility to the parking garage, a 200-seat dining complex, andseveral conference and meetingrooms. Above the second floor, thelaboratory floors are connected byopen atria surrounding the centralstaircases, in an effort to promotecollaboration and community.(Chiles refers to these as \u00d2researchneighborhoods.\u00d3) Faculty andgraduate student offices fill thecurtain wall in the front of thebuilding, facing the quad;laboratories and research space face Plantation Street. \u00d2Part of the challenge of the design comes from, first, the prominenceof the site, and second, from theneed to \u00d4face\u00d5 in two directions,\u00d3explained Chiles. \u00d2At urbancampuses, new buildings are oftenburied in a forest of existingstructures, whereas here, the newbuilding will command attention.Too, while the entrance of thebuilding faces the quadrangle,there\u00d5s also a \u00d4front\u00d5 on Plantation Street, because that\u00d5s such animportant thoroughfare for UMMSand the biotechnology park.\u00d3 \u00d2We\u00d5re going to fill this building with great researchers and greatscientists,\u00d3 enthused Dr. Lazare.\u00d2Some of them are already on thefaculty, and others will \u00d4recruitthemselves\u00d5 to Worcester as they seeall of the exciting things happeningaround our research enterprise. Weknow that research growth isnecessary to retain and recruit thebest faculty; research growth isessential for outstanding education,for the success of our clinicalpartner, UMass Memorial, and forthe success of our efforts to curedisease and eliminate humansuffering. At a time when medicalschools like ours are recognized askey to the advancement ofbiomedical science, this buildingwill be a key part of the future of UMMS.\u00d3 Groundbreaking for the new building is scheduled for December1999; occupancy is planned forSeptember 2001. The estimated $100million cost will be paid for in part by philanthropy. A fundraisingcampaign for the building isanchored by a $5 million pledgefrom the Massachusetts AFL-CIO forcancer research programs within walls. In addition, funding for cutting-edge researchwas pledged by UMass MemorialHealth Care at the time of themerger of Memorial Health Carewith the UMass clinical system in1998.

Since 1894, when the DPH estab- lished the facility, the laboratorieshave introduced vaccines to preventdiphtheria, pertussis, tetanus andother diseases. Employees alsopioneered the use of immuneglobulins, a class of proteins takenfrom the blood plasma of humansimmune to a specific disease. Theseimmune globulins provide passiveprotection against diseases.a staff favorite The New England Newborn Screening Program (NENSP)occupies a warm spot in the heartsof many Jamaica Plain employees.Since its inception in program \u00d1 UMMS \u00d1 for over 3million infants in Maine, Vermont,New Hampshire and Rhode Island,as well as Massachusetts, andidentified nearly 2,000 newbornswith significant clinical disorders. \u00d2No one likes to carry the news that a baby has a disorder,\u00d3 said ProgramCoordinator Cecelia McGonagle, a23-year veteran of NENSP. that we detect problems earlyenough to prevent clinicalcomplications is probably the mostrewarding part of the job.\u00d3 The technicians and physicians who work at NENSP strive to affordnewborns the opportunity todevelop to their fullest potential.The staff analyzes blood specimenstaken from newborns atMassachusetts\u00d5 birthing hospitalsand hospitals in the four other statesthe NENSP serves and tests thespecimens for a series of disordersthat, if left unrecognized anduntreated, could compromise achild\u00d5s health. The staff undertakesaggressive tactics to find any babysuspected of having a disorder.\u00d2I feel like I\u00d5m making a difference in someone\u00d5s life, even if it\u00d5s anindirect one,\u00d3 said Melody Rush,manager of specimen processing.Rush\u00d5s job, orchestrating the flow ofspecimens to the appropriate labs,increased in complexity this pastFebruary when the DPH directed theNENSP to expand testing throughseveral pilot studies. To meetmodern standards regardingpatients\u00d5 rights and pilot studies,NENSP included mechanisms forparents to participate in the decisionas to whether their babies are testedfor these \u00d2pilot study disorders.\u00d3The expanded screening increasedthe number of tests from nine to 30, and an informational outreachcampaign was launched, includingdevelopment of a Web site andbrochure. In addition, specialpresentations and mailings targeted nursery managers andother health care providers,ensuring that these key personnelunderstood the expanded programand its implications for the state\u00d5snewborns and their families. \u00d2Massachusetts was already screening its population for moredisorders than any other state in thecountry; implementation of thenewly expanded screening extendsthis program\u00d5s leadership role intothe future,\u00d3 said NENSP ActingDirector Roger Eaton, PhD. future promise Throughout its two-year presence on the Jamaica Plain campus, UMMShas worked to maintain a stableenvironment for MBL and NENSPstaff. James Hill, assistant vicechancellor for CommonwealthMedicine, plans to use hisexperience as former DPH associatecommissioner to make this\u00d2cohabitation\u00d3 continue to work.\u00d2Because of my background, I have a unique opportunity to serve as the bridge between DPH and UMMS.My challenge is to take the adminis-trative structure that has been createdand make it so routine that it allowsthe day-to-day business function torecede into the background.\u00d3 George Grady, MD, a 30-year veteran of the labs who is now medicaldirector for NENSP, offers a specialperspective on UMMS\u00d5 adminis-tration MBL, NENSP andseveral other DPH programs, Gradyadmits that laboratory science was a\u00d2bit of an orphan\u00d3 under a stateagency. He added, \u00d2Historically,legislators and policy people werenot mentally programmed to thinkof science existing anywhere butwithin a university. By taking overoperation of most of the complexfunctions of the laboratories, UMassis giving us presumed legitimacy tonot only analyze specimens, but alsoto conduct research. I\u00d5m hoping for the best of both worlds.\u00d3According to MBL Director Donna Ambrosino, MD, UMMS\u00d5 acquisitionof the laboratories affords the state aunique opportunity to combinecutting-edge research, educationand health care. \u00d2These arewonderful facilities that have servedthe public in so many importantways,\u00d3 noted Dr. Ambrosino. \u00d2Webring to the medical school a long,rich history of bright scientists andcommitted workers who displayexceptional quality andinventiveness.\u00d3 The first UMMS-appointed director, Ambrosino said she and DeputyDirector Jeanne Leszczynski, MD,plan to use their expertise toenhance the current capacitiesto develop new products.

The UMMS-operated facilities, housing theMassachusetts Biologic Laboratoriesand the New England NewbornScreening Program, are beneficiariesof the natural interface between themedical school and the state\u00d5sprimary public health provider, theDepartment of Public Health, whose labs are also located withinthe facilities. Equally noteworthy, the staff at the Jamaica Plain campus \u00d1 whobecame UMMS employees in 1997\u00d1 truly embody the public serviceand research aspirations of themedical school. It is these 240individuals \u00d1 employees dedicatedto ensuring that safe and effectivevaccines and plasma products arepublicly accessible and thatnewborns are screened early fortreatable disorders \u00d1 who aremaking this transition a positive one for UMMS. aIn the 1950s, \u00d2Mr. Tetanus\u00d3 Bill Lentham prepares the virus for vaccinations at the Massachusetts Biologic Laboratories, where he was an employee for 36 years.

Each year, I am struck again by how wonderful our students are. My enthusiasm is sharpened by the fact that these youngmen and women share a passion for public service. What impresses me, year after year, istheir generosity of spirit, their commitment to do something for the community, their need to \"pay dividends\" on what they consider their own good fortune. Our students volunteer with the homeless, the disadvantaged, the mentally and physically abused and the powerless of every age. As I reviewed the articles written for this issue of Vitae, I was struck by something I always intuited, but never examined \u2014 these remarkable traits are carried through into the choices they make after they graduate. The three graduates featured on the followingpages illustrate my point. Frank Sacco, class of 1980, is trauma director and chief of surgery service at Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage. The medicalcenter is the first in the nation to be run for Native Americans by Native Americans, and it serves as the health care hub for over 100,000 Native Alaskans. William Mallon, class of 1987 , is director of the emergency medicine residency program at the Los Angeles County/University of Southern CaliforniaMedical Center in Los Angeles. He uses bedside teaching methods to instruct the residents in his program on ailments that afflictthe city's indigent population, including tropical diseases and the fallout from gang-related activity. Rosemarie Stebbins, GSN class of 1997 , works with developmentally and mentally challenged patients, including 16 years at the Monson DevelopmentCenter, and now through her new position with the state Department of Mental Retardation. In her \"spare time\" she is a major in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps Reserves. This, after all, is the reason UMass Medical School can claim a special niche in the state's rich educational firmament. Education is the linchpin of our mission, and it is important to do it well. You are all examples of that commitment. Aaron Lazare, MD , Chancellor and Deana message from the chancellor /dean Alumni Report:* UMass fall / printer 4/5/00 11:19 AM Page 16fall - winter 1999 Vitae 19 18 Vitae fall - winter 1999\"I really enjoy going to work each day,\" said Frank D. Sacco, MD '80, trauma director at the Alaska NativeMedical Center (ANMC) in Anchorage.\"This is such a beautiful and wild place,the Alaskan Natives are delightful folks,and the people I work with are verycollegial and cooperative. It's awonderful combination.\" Dr. Sacco first visited Alaska during medical school, spending two summersin the Yukon Territory working on ahigh-altitude physiology study with theArctic Institute of North America. Aftercompleting a two-year U.S. PublicHealth Service (PHS) scholarshippayback on a New Mexico Navajoreservation, he spent three months in1983 as a PHS locum tenens at Alaska's remote Kotzebue Hospital. He thencompleted a surgical residency rotationin Alaska, finally moving there in 1991as a general surgeon with the ANMC. \"This is a great job for a general surgeon,\" said Sacco of his currentposition. \"I get to perform a tremendousvariety of surgery \u2014 thoracic, vascular,pediatric \u2014 because we have so fewspecialists.\" He also flies to remotehospital locations several times a year tocare for patients there, teaches surgicalresidents on rotation and takes part inclinical research with the on-site office ofthe Centers for Disease Control (CDC).The ANMC is operated by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium,making Alaska the first state to have allits health facilities for Native Americansrun by Native organizations. The mostmedically advanced facility in thenation's system of Native health care, it serves as the health care hub for all100,000 Alaska Natives as well as sixregional hospitals funded by the IndianHealth Service. It's also the state's firstand only trauma center. \"Trauma is the leading cause of death among Native Alaskans,\" Sacco noted.To combat that statistic, he's beenactive in establishing the state'strauma system and developing injuryprevention programs \u2014 earningcommendations from the PHS for his efforts. He's also been involved in CDC research to study the unusually highincidence of the bacteria H.pylori in the Native population. \"We see a lot ofstomach cancer, so now we're lookingat whether H.pylori could be associatedwith that. \"We also see a lot of liver cancer associated with high rates of hepatitisB,\" he continued. As a result, the ANMCinitiated an aggressive surveillanceprogram, screening carriers every sixmonths and vaccinating the Nativepopulation at birth. \"There are no newcases of hepatitis B now,\" he added. An additional bonus Sacco reaps through his practice: \"I don't spend a lot of my time worrying about billingand collections up here,\" Sacco said.\"It's a nice way to patients whosemedical conditions are reflected in avariety of customs, not all of themcommon. As an emergency medicinephysician at Los Angeles County/ University of Southern California Medical Center(LAC+USC) in the heart of ethnicallydiverse Los Angeles \u2014 a crossroadsbetween cultures and critical care \u2014 Dr. Mallon tends to those in the ER witha wide variety of cultural conventions,including gang members who use graffitiand tattoos as forms of expression. As director of residency training at LAC+USC, Mallon helps interpret themessages these \"languages\" provide forthe physicians training in his program. \"We teach emergency physicians to recognize who their patients are, whatcultures and subcultures they comefrom, so they can treat them better andform a strong doctor-patient alliance,\"explained Mallon, an associateprofessor of clinical emergency medicineat USC School of Medicine. Los Angelesis a major point of entry for immigrantsfrom Central and South America and thePacific Rim. As a result, Mallon seespatients suffering from a variety oftropical diseases such as malaria,tetanus and Chaga's Disease, a parasiticinfection that affects the heart and otherorgans. \"We jokingly say that trainingand treating patients here is like atropical medicine fellowship withfacilities that flush!\" Mallon encourages residents to understand the alternative medicinetechniques their patients may use \u2014methods familiar to them in theircountries of origin, but ones that maylead to an emergency room visit toLAC+USC. \"Emergency physicians needto ask what their patients are doing andnot in terms of being judgmental, but toform an alliance. Only then will a trustingrelationship develop which promotes compliance with your care.\" Physicians learn to recognize \"coining\" skin lesions, for example, to avoiddrawing the wrong conclusion abouttheir patients' medical problems.\"Coining involves rubbing a circularobject dipped in tiger balm on the skin,raising a reddish wheel that is believedto treat all kinds of maladies,\" explainedMallon. Failure to recognize these skinlesions can lead to the inappropriatesuspicion of child abuse or other trauma. Mallon and his residents interpret marks on skin of a different kind as they treatgang members rushed to the hospitalfrom graffiti-laden neighborhoodssurrounding the medical center. \"LA hasexported its gangs other parts of thecountry and world,\" said Mallon, whorecently lectured on the language oftattoos and graffiti to members ofLondon's Scotland Yard. Mallon andfellow UMass graduate and USC facultymember Marie Russell, MD, comparedtheir notes on tattoos and graffiti andfound that one form of communicationcan sometimes translate the other. \"Afair amount of information with medicalrelevance to patient lifestyle and diseaserisks can be determined,\" explainedMallon. \"For example, a large tattoo with the numbers 15550 represents theCalifornia penal code chapter forpossession of drugs with intent to sell.This tells us that the patient is heavilyinvolved in the drug culture and mayeven be advertising his intent to sell drugs.\" The unique interpretive skills Mallon fashions in his residents eventuallybenefit patients outside of Los Angeles,as over 400 graduates are now inpractice throughout the country. \"I lovedoing my research, but the real productif you are a program director is thepeople you ALBWilliam D.

She holds a master's degree in nursing (GSN '97) as well as certification as anadult nurse practitioner and acute care nurse practitioner. She has spentnearly two decades working withdevelopmentally and mentallychallenged individuals, including 16 years at Monson DevelopmentalCenter, a long-term care facility run bythe Commonwealth of Massachusetts,and now through her new position with the state Department of MentalRetardation. And that's just her civilian career. Stebbins is also a major in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps Reserves, whereshe's an OR nurse and recentlycompleted Command and General StaffOfficer College, a two-year programthat's equivalent to earning a master'sdegree in military leadership. She plansto stay in the Reserves another eightyears (to reach a total of 20) and aimsto attain the rank of \"full-bird\" colonel. \"I'd always been interested in the military,\" said Stebbins of her decisionto sign up. \"I wanted to serve mycountry and, if needed, be there to carefor our fighting men and women.\" \"I started out in a 1,000-bed general hospital; then, after Desert Storm, myunit became a 296-bed mobile hospitalmade up of boxes and tents. It coversseveral acres and takes three days toset up,\" she explained. \"I really enjoythe work and have had the opportunityto go on humanitarian missions toGuatemala and Panama.\"Meanwhile, her civilian career has also evolved. \"I started at Monson in the late 1970 s as a part-time nurse,\" she said. \"At that time, they were using nursepractitioners because they had adifficult time attracting physicians tothat setting. I had the opportunity to goto NP school through the state. When Igraduated, I owed the state time, so Istayed at Monson to pay it back andfound that I loved working withdevelopmentally disabled individuals.\" \"It was a great experience,\" Stebbins continued. \"I worked very indepen-dently and managed a wide varietyof health care problems. In thatenvironment, you see abnormalitiesyou wouldn't ordinarily see. And therewere no malingerers \u2014 if there'ssomething wrong, it's serious.\" While working full time at Monson \u2014 and continuing to fulfill her militarycommitment \u2014 she decided to earn hermaster's from the Graduate School ofNursing, knowing it would help heradvance on both career tracks. Sherecently transitioned into a new rolewith the state, dealing with the samepopulation as at Monson but in acommunity setting, serving as aconsultant-educator to DMR staff andstaff in group homes, and as a healthcare advocate for the individualsshe serves. Stebbins' goals for the future include attaining the position of chief nurse orcommander of an Army medical unitand continuing to work to improve thelives of those with developmentaldisabilities. \u2014 RHdual career tracksClass fall / printer 4/5/00 11:19 AM Page 20fall - winter 1999 Vitae 23 22 Vitae fall - winter 1999To submit a class note, send your news to: Office of Alumni Relations, University of Massachusetts Medical School I 55 Lake Avenue North I Worcester, MA 01655 or e-mail sandra.beling @umassmed.edu call (508) 856 8300 fax (508) 856 8662 1992 Rebecca Jones, MD, wrote, \"I'm working in Springfield as a dermatologist at New England Dermatology and engaged to Paul Haley, MD '88.

Lazare Amphitheater atthe medical school wove togetherelements that left both participantsand audience uplifted with hope for thefuture of school endeavors. Naming of the auditorium, in memory of the first child adopted by Chancellor andDean Aaron Lazare and his wife Louise,is in recognition of the Lazare family'sendowment gift of $250,000 to theCenter for Adoption Research and Policy. The Lazare family, which grew to include eight adopted children in all, joinedUMMS participants for the dedication. It was the family's interest in adoptionproblems and solutions that helpedbring about establishment of the UMasssystem's Center for Adoption Researchand Policy at the Worcester campus in major campaign planned for new building It's a goal that measures up to the new millennium. The UMass Memorial Foundation has announced a campaign to raise $33 million from private philanthropy toward constructionof a new research laboratory building on the UMMS campus. Volunteer leadership for the campaign will be announced later this fall, according to M Howard Jacobson, chair of the foundation. With groundbreaking scheduled for December 1999, plans call for a fast-track construction schedule that will have the 350,000-square-foot building ready for occupancy in September2001. Its size, purpose and central location (see story beginning on page 8) make it the most significant construction project on campus since UMass Hospital opened in 1976. The foundation's fundraising component for the building \u2014 approximately one-third of the overall cost of $100 million \u2014 will include major gifts solicited as naming opportunities. For example, in addition to the naming of the building itself, a specific research center, an entire floor of the building, or an individual laboratory can be named in honor of adonor or memorial gift. UMass Memorial Health Care has already committed $30 million in support of construction. The Massachusetts AFL-CIO has pledged to raise $5 million for the Cancer Center, which will be relocated to the building. The remainder of the building'scost will be realized through sales of Massachusetts HEFA bonds, to be retired throughthe use of cost reimbursements that are part of federal research grants. Fundraising for the building is a major component of the foundation's capital campaign being planned for the new century. The multi-faceted campaign will support and advance the strategic priorities of both the UMMS academic system and UMassMemorial's clinical enterprise.

Enhancements being considered include expansion of print and electroniccollections, and renovation of existingfacilities to meet the demand forcollaborative and group-learning space. The only public medical library in the commonwealth, the Lamar SoutterLibrary serves UMMS faculty, students,affiliated sites and health careprofessionals throughout the region. Dr. Soutter, the school's first employee,served as dean from 1963 until 1975.Called the \"father of UMass MedicalSchool,\" he died in 1996. His wife Mary,a resident of Concord, remains a devotedfriend of the school. For more information on ways to support the library, contact Brandt Henderson at(508) 856-4266.In August, the executive committee sponsored an orientation program forparents of students in the class of 2003.The council, formed in 1993 through theefforts of Paul and Mimi LaCamera, also helps raise funds to support allacademic initiatives. \"Some of our most enthusiastic supporters raiseconsiderable philanthropic supporteach year for the school,\" noted KevinCourtney, associate vice chancellor for development. \"We're very excited about being involved with this wonderful institution,\" said Bob Feldman, who praises the learningenvironment and \"atmosphere of totalcooperative effort\" among faculty, staffand administration. \"Medical school isa challenging time for students \u2014 anopportunity for them to realize theirpotential and find their place in themedical community.\" For Nancy Feldman, the role of parents can be summed up through her ownexperience: \"From our son's first day, I'vefelt that we parents are tremendouslyprivileged to have our children receivetheir medical education at UMass. TheParents Council helps keep us connectedwith the school and with our children'sextraordinary experience.\" \u00d4pioneer pride\u00d5 prompts major gift Always a pacesetter, the medical school's pioneer class of '74 will be the first toobserve its 25th anniversary milestone \u2014and will do so with gusto.

I never imagined how rapidand extensive that growth would be. The most recent example is the construction of a new researchlaboratory building over the next yearand a half that will effectively doublethe space for scientific research at thisinstitution and provide opportunitiesto attract additional world-classscientists. (See story beginning on page 8.) The building\u00d5s presence on campus will promote the well-establishedinterdisciplinary nature of theeducational program here as well asthe tradition of scientific collaborationamongst colleagues. Indeed, this collaborative atmosphere facilitated a project soon after I arrivedbetween my laboratory and GermanPihan, MD, an assistant professor of pathology and a clinical oncologyresearcher in the Department ofPathology. Our research challenge: toidentify pre-malignant prostate lesionsthat will progress to deadly prostatecancer. With life-threatening disease at an early stage of tumor develop-ment, treatment can be targeted tothese individuals. Our initial work was made possible through small pilot grants from theMassachusetts Department of PublicHealth and the Our Danny CancerFund. But based on our observationsthat centrosomes \u00d1 tiny organellesthat orchestrate the segregation of chromosomes during cell division \u00d1perform differently in malignanttumors than in normal tissue, werecently received a $450,000 grantfrom the U.S. Army to continuesearching for answers to twoimportant questions raised by ourresearch: Can centrosome defectscontribute to prostate cancer and canthey predict which prostate tumorswill become malignant? No method currently exists to effec- tively predict which prostate cancersor pre-cancerous lesions of theprostate will develop into malignanttumors. With no prognostic indicatoravailable, most patients with prostatecancer are treated by excision of tumortissue and chemotherapy, usually in combination. Thankfully, this approach has a high success rate if patients are treated earlyduring disease development, but it hasseveral drawbacks. Most patientsreceive treatment unnecessarilybecause most tumors remain benignand asymptomatic. For this reason,men and their families are subjected to the mental anguish of treatment for a disease that most likely wouldnot prove fatal. Moreover, surgeryoften has serious side effects. Finally,the annual cost of treating 170,000 men unnecessarily is enormous. Thus,our challenge. The collaboration between my lab- oratory and Dr. Pihan was establishedto study prostate cancer using bothbasic science and clinical approaches. We found that by increasing the levels of a centrosome protein calledpericentrin, we could make normalcells have either fewer or more than the normal number of chromosomes\u00d1 features similar to a tumor cell. We next asked if pericentrin levels andcentrosomes were abnormal in tumorcells and found that nearly all themalignant tumors we analyzed hadcentrosome defects. Can centrosomedefects predict which prostate tumorswill become malignant? Although wedo not yet know the answer, ourevidence is provocative. Perhaps most interesting is our observation that pericentrin levels are elevated in prostate tumors andmore importantly, in pre-cancerouslesions. Since our studies show thatpericentrin levels induce abnormallevels of chromosomes in normalcells, it is tempting to think that asimilar mechanism may be working in prostate cancer to drive tumordevelopment. We are currently testing this idea. It is our belief that basic research combined with clinical applicationsprovides a powerful approach tounderstanding human disease. Withthe new research laboratory buildingserving as the backdrop to researchconducted by world-class scientistsworking collaboratively, UMMS showsits commitment to fostering liaisonsthat lead to crucial breakthroughs \u00d1breakthroughs that can help relieveheartache on the part of those affectedby cancer and other deadly diseases. wby stephen j. doxsey, phd, Assistant Professor of Cell Biology and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Program in Molecular MedicineThe Last Word:* UMass fall / printercover 4/5/00 1:58 PM Page 7 "}
