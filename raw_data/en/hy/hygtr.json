Limit Your Alcohol Consumption While alcohol is an element of social life, but studies suggest that alcohol causes and exacerbates headache pain, tension headaches, and migraines. Limiting your alcohol consumption, especially before bed, is a great step in naturally reducing your headache frequency. 4. Acupuncture For centuries, acupuncture has been used as a natural remedy for a variety of ailments. Headaches are no different. Studies show that acupuncture relieves migraines as effectively as common migraine medications. Acupuncture is a natural remedy for headaches and also an excellent way to reduce stress and inflammation. 5. Exercise When the body finds itself out of balance, it often reacts physically. Exercise is an excellent way to reestablish healthy norms and alleviate headaches. Exercise boosts endorphins. These hormones activate the opioid receptors in the brain, which alleviate general bodily pain and naturally relieve headaches. Whether you enjoy hiking, biking, swimming, or running, get out there and get some exercise. 6. Take Magnesium Magnesium is an essential mineral that is a natural remedy for headaches. While we can consume magnesium in our diets, we don't always consume what our body requires.

Integrating more magnesium into your diet, or taking a magnesium supplement, can help to reduce your headaches. 7. Yoga In recent years, yoga has been proven to have a plethora of health benefits. Not only does yoga help to increase your quality of life, but it helps to decrease headache frequency when practiced regularly. Yoga is an activity that has been found to reduce stress, ease anxiety, and now it can even help relieve headaches. 8. Avoid Histamines Histamines provoke the body's immune system, which causes inflammation, tension, and yes, headaches. The latest research shows that reducing foods which contain a high amount of histamines can help to contribute to headache relief. Being more conscious of your diet naturally reduces headaches. 9. Essential Oils When diffused, essential oils have provided both comfort and relief to those dealing with headaches. Lavender is one of these essential oils; studies have found that lavender is effective at alleviating tension headaches and migraines. You can apply essential oils directly to fabrics, or you can use a diffuser. 10.
