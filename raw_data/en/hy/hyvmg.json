The virus infects your nose, throat and sometimes your lungs. Flu is highly contagious and spreads easily between people, particularly in winter as the influenza virus lives and grows best in cold and dry conditions. Flu can cause symptoms similar to a cold, but they tend to come on faster and can be more severe. Symptoms will vary for each person, but common flu symptoms include: - headaches - sore throat - stuffy or runny nose - persistent, dry cough - chills and sweats - high temperature (fever) - aching muscles - tiredness - loss of appetite - diarrhoea - feeling and being sick. Most people recover from flu in around one week without any complications. However, flu can be more serious for some people. It can also cause dangerous complications, like [pneumonia](/vaccinations/pneumonia) and heart problems, and can be fatal in severe cases. People who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill with flu include: - adults over 65 - children under five - pregnant women - people with a long-term medical condition, like diabetes, heart or lung disease - people with a weakened immune system, for example due to chemotherapy or HIV - people who are frequently exposed to flu, like healthcare workers. If you have flu symptoms and you're at risk of becoming seriously ill or your symptoms don't improve after seven days, call 111 or [visit NHS 111 online](https://111.nhs.uk/). Getting the flu vaccine is an effective way to protect yourself and others from flu. It's given as a single injection, usually into your upper arm. The vaccine helps your immune system produce antibodies that protect against the influenza virus. If you do get flu after having the vaccine, you will usually experience milder symptoms and recover quicker. It can take between 10 and 14 days for the vaccine to start working. The virus that causes flu rapidly mutates and evolves into new strains. Each year, experts from organisations like the World Health Organization identify which strains pose the greatest risk in the upcoming flu season, and a vaccine is developed to protect against those strains before each flu season starts. We also offer a corporate flu jab service. [Learn more](/vaccinations/flu-jabs/corporate). Have you had your pneumonia vaccine? Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition (swelling) in one or both lungs, usually caused by a bacterial infection. It can also be caused by a virus like flu or coronavirus. 20,000 pneumonia cases are reported in the UK each year. Anyone can get pneumonia but it's more common and can be more serious in people over 65, babies and people with long-term health conditions. Our pneumonia vaccination service is available all year round. "}
