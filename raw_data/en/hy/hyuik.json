It is based on the principle that qi flows through meridians and can be blocked by toxins, stress, trauma, hormones, and food. Acupuncture is used for pain relief, general health enhancement, and promoting the body's innate healing capacity. Acupuncture is a safe and effective treatment for various illnesses, including pain, chronic pain, and menopausal symptoms. It increases endorphin levels, which help reduce pain, unlike opioid medications, which have adverse effects and addiction. Acupuncture is known for its long-lasting benefits, such as improved AMH hormone levels in PCOS patients. Patients should consult licensed acupuncturists for safe and effective treatment.
