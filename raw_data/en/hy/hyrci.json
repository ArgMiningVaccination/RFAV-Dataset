The program operated from October 7, 1993 through June 22, 1998. A total of 73 clients received the naltrexone treatment in combination with therapy. In 1995, the Delaware Criminal Justice Council provided funds to support the naltrexone drug treatment program for heroin addicts, implemented by SODAT - Delaware, Inc. This outcome evaluation assessed the success of the stated impact (outcome) objectives of the program. The four stated outcome objectives were as follows: . . . . Have 60% of the heroin addicts who begin treatment stay off all drugs during treatment; Finding: Of the 73 participants in the program, 18 (25%) tested positive for drugs and 55 (75%) tested negative for drugs during treatment. Have 60% of the heroin addicts who begin treatment successfully complete the program; Finding: Of the 73 participants in the program, 10 (13.7%) were successfully discharged from the program. Increase the number of SNAP participants who are employed, in school, or in vocational training by 50% within 90 days of their admission into treatment; and, Finding: Data was only available for employment. At the beginning of the program 46.6% of the participants were employed and 52% were unemployed. Participants exited the program with a 57.5% employment rate and a 39.7% unemployment rate. Have 60 percent of eight remain heroin free six months after completing the 18 month program. Finding: This objective was not assessed due to insufficient contact with program participants after leaving program. The program met two of the three outcome objectives. Although 75% of the participates remained drug flee during the program, 83.6% of the participants failed to complete the program successfully. These results lead to the observation that remaining drug free in a heroin antagonist treatment program may not be related to successful completion of the heroin addiction treatment. The majority of SNAP clients were African American, who were single and male. The median age of SNAP participants was 31 years old. During the implementation of the evaluation some additional research questions were posed. These were as follows: 1. What was the performance of SNAP program participants who had previous drug treatment experience? 2. What was the relationship between program discharge status and length of participation in the program? 3. What was the relationship between successful completion in the SNAP program and marital status and employments status? 4. What was the relationship between the first age of substance abuse and those who first used heroin to success or failure in the SNAP program.'? Previous drug treatment did not provide an increased chance of successful completion in the program. Of the seventy SNAP participants who had prior drug treatment histories, 84 percent failed to successfully complete treatment. Being married did not prove to be a positive factor in successful treatment. Participants who were married and successfully completed treatment accounted for only 6.6 percent of the total SNAP population compared to the 15.8 percent of those who were single and successfiflly completed treatment. Being employed was associated with program success. Those participants who were employed and successfully completed treatment accounted for 21 percent of the total SNAP population compared to the 3 percent who were unemployed and successfully completed treatment. Most of the SNAP participants started to use drugs in their early teen years. The longer length of time of use of drugs did not prove to be associated with successful treatment. The variable of longer length of time of use of drugs did prove to be associated with failure to successfully complete treatment. The rate of arrest post program discharge showed that the majority of those who had post arrests were participants who did not successfully complete the program. , I I i I ,! I II ! olI I: I I ! ! I I I ! The following recommendations for future heroin drug treatment program design are made after review of the literature on heroin addiction and treatment as well as f~om results . Heroin drug treatment programs for non professional, high addiction level, street addicts have success rates ranging from a low of 12 percent to a high of 20 percent. Program impact objectives should not propose success rates that are beyond the current state of the art in treatment. Assessment of success ofnaltrexone treatment programs should be made using multiple measures including abstinence rates, improvement in employment status, success in therapy treatment, reaching social goals, positive behavior changes and the level of involvement in criminal activity rather than on retention alone. More than 80 percent of the clients in the SNAP program were classified as failure due to noncompliance with the program. Dug treatment programs like the SNAP program should assess the program's theory and implementation based on the type of clients that participate in the program. The presence of psychological dysfunction in potential clients can effect retention and successful completion rates. Programs should determine whether the treatment modality will include clients who have psychological problems. Drug addiction is not a problem in which the addiction to a specific drug is the only focus of attention. Drug addiction is usually one member of a family of issues within the life of the addict. Treatment programs nee d to be designed to address the individual addict and quality of life issues that the addict is experiencing along with the addiction to the drug itself. Program designers should consider the biological as well as the cognitive- behavioral aspects of addiction when designing drug addiction modalities. The biochemical and cognitive-behavioral aspects of drug addiction presents the criminal justice system with political as well as social policy issues. The criminal justice system needs to contend with the implications of the fact that drug addicts have altered brain chemistry, while maintaining its inherent purpose of focusing on individual accountability and responsibility. Conversely, drug treatment designers and drug addiction scientists must contend with the fact that personal responsibility and accountability will always be a demand of policy makers and the public regardless of the science of addiction. ! I ! II II ! ! el ! ! ! ! I ! W Introduction More than 74 million Americans have tried an illicit drug at least once in their lifetime, and 2.4 million Americans have tried heroin at least once in their lifetimes.~ This usage of illicit drugs has increased over the past two years. In 1996, 23 million Americans had tried illicit drugs at least once and 460,000 had tried heroin at least once? In 1979, there were about 128,000 Americans who used heroin and by 1996 that number had risen to 216,000. 3 \"The majority of heroin users are still older, chronic users who inject the drug. At the same time, the number of new, young users who snort or smoke the drug, continues to rise. ''4 According to the DEA, the \"typical heroin user today consumes more heroin than a typical user did just a decade ago, which is not surprising given the higher purity currently available at the street level. ''5 Historically heroin is taken intravenously, subcutaneously (under the skin), or intramuscularly 6 but due to the high level of purity (as high as 98 percent), it can be snorted or smoked. The purity of the heroin now makes heroin snorting possible, and makes heroin more \"appealing to new users because it eliminates both the fear of acquiring syringe-borne diseases.., and the historical stigma attached to intravenous heroin use. ''7 In Newark, Delaware, the purity of heroin has been found to range from 20 to 90 percent, s The New Castle County Police have reported that purity levels have been found to be as high as 97% in Dover, Delaware? According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Newark, Delaware sources report that there has been a \"'definite increase in teenage users'.., dealers, some from nearby Philadelphia, are making a clear attempt to establish a new market. For example, by encouraging young females to begin use, dealers hope to attract older male users. In that area, users start at around 13, and the source reports that there are 'chronic' users aged 15 - 17. ''l\u00b0 It has recently been reported that between 1993 and 1995, 88 percent of new heroin users were between the age of 12 to 25 years old) ~ The \"average age of addicts seeking treatment is getting younger. In 1993, only 17.2 percent of heroin addicts who reported for treatment were 24 or younger. By 1997, the percentage had climbed to 31.7 percent. ''12 The number of people who are treated for heroin addiction in Delaware has increased from 336 in 1991 to 1,767 in 1997, an increase of 426 percent) 3 The impact of the increase in heroin usage can be seen in the State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council Research and Evaluation Unit SODAT SNAP May 1999 Outcome Evaluation Page 1 number of heroin related deaths. Deaths related to heroin have increased from 14 in 1991, to 29 in 1997.14 The national average of heroin purity is 35 percent. 15 The purity average level for heroin in Delaware is g5 percent.ms In an effort to deal with the growing heroin use problem in Delaware, SODAT - Delaware 17, Inc., received a $55,000 grant in 1995 from the Delaware Criminal Justice CouncilJ s Subsequent grants were made in 1996 and 1997.19 The SODAT Naltrexone Alternative Program (SNAP) was designed to provide \"intensive outpatient therapy which utilizes the blocking medication, naltrexone, to assist eight heroin addicted persons in their attempts to discontinue the use of heroin and other drugs, and to promote pro-social behavior with no new criminal arrest. ''2\u00b0 The purpose of this outcome evaluation will be to assess whether the stated impact objectives of the SNAP program were achieved. ! ! I I I I il ,| ,I i m I I ! I State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 2 ! I SNAP: Design and Theory Program Narrative (Statement of the Problem) As noted in the introduction, heroin use is increasing nationwide and in Delaware due to the higher level of purity. The number of teens and young adults who have tried heroin and are becoming addicted to heroin is increasing. In an effort to address the addiction of heroin, SODAT has been funded to implement an outpatient heroin treatment program which uses the drug naltrexone to assist those who are trying to end their addiction. PrOgram Goal / Objective Identification As noted in the introduction, the goal of the SNAP program is to provide naltrexone to heroin addicts in order to assist in the discontinuation of heroin use. The specific program objectives are as follows: . have 60% of the heroin addicts who begin treatment stay offall drugs and in treatment throughout the year; . have 60% of the heroin addicts who begin treatment successfully complete the program; . . increase the number of SNAP participants who are employed, in school, or in vocational training by 50% within 90 days of their admission into treatment; and, have 60% of eight participants remain heroin free six months after completing the 18 month program? l Program Theory The SNAP program is based on the theory that the heroin addict, (once detoxification is completed) will be assisted in ending his/her heroin addiction ff medication is provided that blocks the effects 0fheroin use. The heroin blocking medication provided was State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 3 naltrexone. \"Naltrexone is an orally administered medication which prevents the uptake [affects] of opioid compounds. Thus, when taking this medication, any person who uses heroin by any route will not experience any affects whatsoever. In conjunction with intensive outpatient therapy and therapeutic case management services, the naltrexone protocol has proven to be very effective in the treatment of heroin addiction. ''22 Program Design As noted, in the 1995 grant the \"general focus of SNAP treatment is on client stabilization, maintenance of [a] drug free and crime free lifestyle, securing a recovery oriented support network, and providing relapse prevention education. ''23 The SNAP program was designed to provide a four phase treatment strategy for heroin addicts over a 12 to 18 month period. In phase one, \"the treatment focus [is] on client stabilization. ''24 The client must first be heroin free for seven days. I_fthe client is found to have heroin in his/her system, the client is referred to detoxification. Once the client is found to be free from heroin use for seven days, administration of naltrexone is provided. \"Phase [one] is an intensive portion of treatment and involves client attendance in six treatment groups weekly, bi-monthly individual and case management sessions, and referral to daily 12-step support group meetings. The client is discouraged from seeking employment for the duration of this phase. ''25 Phase one continues between one and three months. I ,, i! *l i i |i ,| I ! i I In phase two, focus on treatment shifts to relapse prevention. This phase \"involves three therapeutic groups weekly, monthly individual counseling sessions and referral to 12 - step support group meetings. The duration of Phase-I] is directly related to client progress and may continue for 5-7 months. Naltrexone may be discontinued after successful completion of a combined total of 6 months of treatment. ''26 In phase three, group therapy continues but is reduced to \"two treatment groups weekly and monthly individual counseling. Clients continue at this stage in treatment for 3-6 months. ''~7 In phase four, aftercare services are provided. The use of group treatment is continued and ! | i I i State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 4 t ! clients \"are required to attend one group session a week, mOnthly individual counseling and weekly 12 step support group meetings.

I i l Brief Literature review on the use of Naltrexone Heroin addiction and naltrexone treatment Heroin Addiction: a brief history Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of opium prepared from morphine. 29 Heroin was first introduced into medicine in 1898, and was used as a pain medication until the addictive nature of opioids in general were found. 3\u00b0 Heroin is classified as a narcotic due to its ability to produce mood and behavior changes, potential for dependence and tolerance following continued use, and it being a derivative ofopiumY In 1914 the Harrison Act was passed, which \"was interpreted as excluding the provision of opioids to addicts as a legitimatemedical use. ''32 Although the use of opiates was illegal, \"heroin addiction persisted and its prevalence rose following World War II [and by] the early 1960% [many recommended] remedicalizing heroin distribution as a way to reduce crime associated with heroin addiction. ''33 With the increase of heroin addiction in the U.S. Military during the Vietnam War and in society as a whole, federal funds were expended for both research and treatment of heroin addicts) 4 Over the past thirty years, various techniques have been developed to treat heroin addicts. One of the treatment methods developed over the past 25 years, involves the use of long-acting opioid antagonists for heroin addicts. 35 Antagonist treatment methods differ from substitution (maintenance) treatment programs in that the antagonist programs use medication to eliminate an addiction. Substitution treatment methods uses one drug, methadone for example, as a replacement for another drag, heroin. The SNAP program is an antagonist treatment program that uses the opioid antagonist naltrexone, which \"blocks or reverses the psysiologic and psychological effects of opioids by binding opiate receptors\" in the brain. 36 State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council Research and Evaluation Unit SODAT SNAP May 1999 Outcome Evaluation Page 6 Antagonist Treatment: Naltrexone \"prevents in narcotic addiction. ''37 The use ofnaltrexone is based on \"the assumption that classically conditioned withdrawal symptoms and operantly reinforced drug seeking behaviors contribute to high relapse ''3s in heroin addicts. Theoretically, by blocking the euphoric effects of opioids, treatment with antagonists would lead to the extinction of operantly reinforced drug seeking; by preventing the reestablishment of physical dependence, treatment with antagonists also leads to the eventual extinction of conditioned withdrawal phenomena. Recently,... empirical and laboratory observations [show] patients taking naltrexone experience less craving in the presence of opioid-related cues, presumably because, on a cognitive basis, they are aware that they are unable to experience the opioid effects. 39 Early studies and theoretical use ofnaltrexone proposed that naltrexone would be effective in dealing with impulsive and compulsive heroin use in addicts who are in treatment? \u00b0 Early research on heroin addiction recognized that recovering heroin addicts could recidivate, and develop full addiction due to impulsive heroin use by environmental stimuli. The stimuli could be an interaction between the recovering addict and a friend, whom the addict had a history of heroin use with, or being in a neighborhood in which heroin is used. The stimuli causes a craving for the heroin that could cause re-addiction. Goldstein explained that, \"naltrexone can protect against impulsive use and can prevent the consequences of impulsive use. The protective medication [the naltrexone] is taken at a time when motivation [to end the addiction] is high, then later, if circumstances arise that would typically lead to use the agonist drug [heroin], there is a strong reason to avoid that behavior\" because the subject knows the heroin will not have any effect. 41 Naltrexone can also aid in the reduction of compulsive addiction. The cognitive knowledge that the use of the heroin will not have an effect reduces the obsessing over the craving for the heroin. Thus naltrexone will assist the addict in developing behavior reinforcers of resisting the thoughts and desires for the drug, in turn reducing compulsive addictive behavior. Although use ofnaltrexone has been found to block the effects of heroin, one of the biggest problems in heroin addiction 42 treatment, along with heroin detoxification of addicts, is ! I ! I I r! I t i ! ! ! i State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 7 I ! ! ! I | i \"i /\" I low compliance in taking the naltrexone by the addicts and their high drop out rate. 43 Kaplan and Sadock noted that in one study, \"the dropout rate was quite high: 25 percent of subjects who started treatment dropped out within two weeks; 94 percent stopped by nine months. ''~ In a study in Israel, the average retention rate for program participants was 56.3 days. 45 Out of a total of 32 patients, 58 percent completed the program. 46 Forty percent of the patients dropped out of the program within 2 weeks and 60 percent of the patients who dropped out did so within the remaining ten weeks of the program. 47 State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 8 I 1 .o_ I I 1 ! d ! i i I ! \\ i' / ,! i ,i Methodology Between October 7, 1993 and July 22, 1998, the SNAP program provided 73 participants naltrexone as part of their treatment for heroin addiction.

State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 17 Outcome Objective 3: Increase the number of SNAP participants who are employed, in school, or in vocational training by 50% within 90 days of their admission into treatment Finding: Data was only available for employment. At the beginning of the program 46.6% of the participants were employed and 52% were unemployed.

Although the objective is written to assess the increase in employment within 90 clays of entering treatment, the actual goal intended was that participants who did not have employment upon entering the program would be employed by the time of discharge. The case files maintained by the SNAP program uniformly noted employment status of each participant upon entering and discharge from the program. Looking at the employment status of the participants upon entry and discharge from the program, there was a 19 percent increase in the number employed, from 34 to 42. Similarly, there was a 23.7 percent decrease in the number unemployed, from 38 to 29. !

I I I I l I I I I I I I The majority of SNAP participants were African American, who were single and male. Most of the participants were male. The median age of SNAP participants was 31 years old. Almost all of the participants had prior drug histories. The majority, 81 percent, began drug use before the age of 18 years old. The main two introduction drugs were alcohol and marijuana. More than 70 percent of SNAP participants used at least one of these drugs as the first drug in their drug use histories. The median age for first drug 15 years old and the 14 years old was the mode. The majority of SNAP patients did not test positive for drugs while in the program. More than 75 percent of the participants remained drug free. But there was not a corresponding result in successful treatment by SNAP participants. The majority of SNAP participants did not successfully complete the program. While the majority of participants did not use drugs, only 13 percent successfully completed the treatment. These results may suggest that drug treatment success may not be related to remaining drug free during treatment. The majority of participants who entered the SNAP program did so unemployed (52%). At time of discharge, the majority of participants were employed (57.5%). Previous drug treatment histories did not provide an increased chance of successful completion in the SNAP program. Of the seventy SNAP participants who had prior drug treatment histories, 84 percent failed to successfully complete treatment. As would be expected, the longer participants remained in the program the higher the rate of program success. Out of the 10 participants who succeeded in treatment, 9 remained in the program longer than 6 months. Conversely, 60 percent of those who failed to complete treatment remained in the program less than 6 months. The median length of time SNAP participants remained in the program was almost 5 months. Being married did not prove to be a positive factor in successful treatment. Participants who were married and successfully completed treatment accounted for only 6.6 percent of the total SNAP population compared to the 15.8 percent of those who were single and successfully completed treatment. In other words, more SNAP participants were singe and successful than State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 29 their married counterparts. More interesting is that more SNAP participants who failed treatment and were single (80.7%) than those who were married (93.3%). The data may suggest that there may be an inverse relationship between successful completion and being married. An alternative theory could be that these married addicts had unstable marriages or were married to addicts. If so, these negative relationships could be decreasing the opportunity for the SNAP participants to take advantage of the program and successfully complete treatment. Being employed was associated with program success. Those participants who were employed and successfully completed treatment accounted for 21 percent of the total SNAP population compared to the 3 percent who were unemployed and successfully completed treatment. Those who were employed and failed to successfully complete treatment accounted for 76 percent of the total SNAP population as compared to 93 percent of those who were unemployed and failed to successfully complete treatment. As previously noted, most of the SNAP patients started to use drugs in their early teen years. The longer length of time of use of drugs did not prove to be associated with successful treatment, but with failure to successfully complete treatment. Across the first use age group, the majority of SNAP participants did not successfully complete treatment. Criminal activity committed by SNAP participants after discharge from the program was low.

I I i l I I i I State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 32 I I Discussion and Conclusion I ! i I I i I I I I ! I I In conclusion, this evaluation found similar results to the evaluation conducted in 1995 by Reedfl Dr. Reed found the SNAP program to be successful (75 percent drug free rate). As noted, a similar rate of 75.3 drug f~ee rate was found in this evaluation. While Dr. Reed assessed the success of the program solely on drug tests, this evaluation reviewed the rate of successful treatment discharge. Assessing both outcomes, it is concluded that the SNAP program was partially successful. The SNAP program achieved a 75 percent negative test for drug use and 13.7 percent treatment success rate. Based on the outcome objectives of the grant, the program failed to have 60 percent of SNAP participants successfully complete the program. But compared to the literature on naltrexone and heroin treatment, a 60 percent treatment success rate goal was not realistic. A review of the literature shows that success rate in naltrexone treatment programs for heroin addicts can range from 12 percent to 20 percent. 49 For example, O'Brien and Greenstein 5\u00b0 note in their study only 12 percent of those who began treatment remained in the program beyond six months. In a study conducted by Tennant and his colleagues, only 16 percent of the program participants completed the program successfully. Dilppoliti and his colleagues conducted a study on treatment retention in Italy and found that after one year, the retention rate among 1503 heroin users using naltrexone was 18 percent/m On the other hand, some of the results of the SNAP program showedbetter results than some of the work in the literature. Both noted in the in the literature and by the first evaluation by Dr. Reed, that patients in a naltrexone program will \"test naltrexone's opiate blockade at least once during treatment. ''52 The results of this program show that the patient on naltrexone may not test the blocking effect of the drug. The large majority of patients, 75 percent, did not test positive for any drugs during their participation in the program. Other measures of drug treatment program success noted in the literature, including employment status change and post program arrest history, were achieved by the program. The SNAP program was able to have the majority of its participants leave the program employed, regardless of discharge status. Those who were employed at time of discharge had a higher rate State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council Research and Evaluation Unit SODAT SNAP May 1999 Outcome Evaluation Page 33 of successful treatment than those who were not employed. Additionally, the percentage of those who were employed and who failed the treatment program was less than those who were unemployed and failed the treatment program. Almost half of all participants, regardless of discharge status, were not arrested after leaving the SNAP program. Of those who were arrested only 5.5 percent (4) were arrested for violent offenses and only 17.8 percent (13) were arrested from drug related offenses. The majority of those who were arrested for drug offenses (12) were those who failed to complete treatment. Other observations about drug addiction in the literature were confirmed, specifically that \"softer\" drugs are introductory drugs to \"harder\" drug use and drug use starts in the early years of adolescence. Alcohol and marijuana proved to be the two introduction drugs to the SNAP patients. Heroin proved to be a distant third. Drug use with the SNAP participants began in their teen years. A majority of the SNAP patients were between 13 and 18 when they first began using drugs.. These results support the general belief that drug use begins in the early years of the addicts life and if a person can remain drug free through these early years the chances of becoming an addict decrease. m~ I I I i I i I I I I I I I I I State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 34 I I Recommendations to the field of criminal justice and drug treatment programs l I I I I i I I l i I I I I I Heroin drug treatment programs for non professional, high addiction level; street addicts have success rates ranging from a low of 12 percent to a high of 20 percent. Program impact objectives should not propose success rates that are beyond the current state of the art in treatment. According to the literature, there are different types of heroin addicts with different expectancy rates of successful treatment completion. 53 The literature notes that naltrexone treatment programs are more successful with addicts who have a stable family structure; married to a non addicted mate; are highly motivated to stop using heroin; have good jobs; have minimal antisocial behavior; have low drug craving / addiction; or have high professional, social or economic status. 54 Programs with addicts who use heroin as a \"self medication\" have a higher rate of program discontinuation or failure. 55 Assessment of success of naltrexone treatment programs should be made using multiple measures including abstinence rates, improvement in employment status, success in therapy treatment, reaching social goals, positive behavior changes and the level of involvement in criminal activity rather than on retention rates alone. The literature on treatment programs notes that high dropout rates is \"the rule for all drug treatment modalities as for treatment of other psychologicai problems. ''s6 While the \"retention rate\" criteria has been the most used and widespread criterion for success, this criteria alone is unreliable for assessing the success of a treatment program or the individual Client in treatment because it does not take into account changes in behavior and life style of the individual. 57 One of the limitations to the retention rate criteria is that it does not take into account the factor of self- selection: s Useof retention rates as a determination of success is vulnerable to selection bias because those who successfully stay in a treatment program do so because the program does not expel them or they choose to remain in the program. Thus the \"success\" or \"failure\" of the program based on retention is artificially inflated or deflated by those who are removed flora the program either by the participants' choice or by the program. Selection bias produces an outcome, i.e. success or failure, that can be explained as function of individual differences among the patients and not the treatment program itself. State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council Research and Evaluation Unit. SODAT SNAP May 1999 Outcome Evaluation Page 35 Although, the \"single most important predictor of success [is] the length of stay in treatment ''59 \"the so-called retention rate.., simply measures the length of time an addict stays in a program '~\u00b0 not the change in the addict due to the program. It has also been noted that retention rates can be associated with factors outside of the program including environmental support for drug addiction, personality characteristics of the addict, employment status, status and health of the addicts' family, psychological status of the addict, criminal history, 61 the readiness of the addict to change 62 and multiple drug use history. More than 80 percent of the clients in the SNAP program were classified as failure due to noncompliance with the program. Drug treatment programs like the SNAP program should assess the program's theory and implementation based on the type of clients that participate in the program. Most of the clients were dismissed fromthe SNAP program due to noncompliance with the treatment modality. Research on program treatment dropouts as well as theory on behavior change notes that treatment programs work with patients who are future oriented, 63 with a positive motivation to change ~ and are at a stage in their addiction were preparation for change 65 is achieved. Future oriented meaning that the addict has made the decision to make change and end his or her addiction. Positively motivated in that the desire to change is self desired, in that the addict wants a better life. The addict is prepared to change and demonstrates this preparation by the formation of a plan to end the addiction. Such a plan can be made by deciding to enter a treatment program with the desire and expectation to successfully complete it. The SNAP program is an action-oriented program designed to assist the addict who wants to change. If the program is servicing addicts who have not reached the point of having a future oriented, positive motivated, present tense mental state change and end their heroin addiction, success rates will be low regardless of the value of the program. l I I l l i I i I I i ! ! ! ! I State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 36 I I I I I i I I I, I I I I l I I I I I The presence of psychological dysfunction on potential cfients can effect retention and successful completion rates. Programs should determine whether the treatment modafity will include clients who have psychological problems. Recent research has asserted that many of those who enter drug treatment programs have moderate to severe mental illness, ss More significant is the fact that only about half of those addicts who have a mental illness receive treatment for the mental illness and the drug addiction together. 67 The effects of mental illness and drop out rates have been shown to be associated, ss Research has also found that mental illness can effect the ability to function and the impact of the drugs on the individual: 9 Programs that decide to address both drug addiction and mental illness should design treatment to take into account the importance of the clients quality of life. Recent research has noted that the patients quality of life (family support, employment, positive self image, ect.) can predict successful treatment independent of other factors including the psychiatric status of the client: \u00b0 Drug addiction is not a problem in which the addiction to a specific drug is the only focus of attention. Drug addiction is usually one member of a family of issues within the fife of the addict. Treatment programs need to be designed to address the individual addict and quality of fife issues that the addict is experiencing along with the addiction to the drug itself. The nature of addiction has been described as a state in which the addict has a (1) persistent regular use of a drug; (2) attempts to stop such use [leads] to significant and painful withdrawal symptoms; (3) continues to use the addictive drug despite damaging physical or psychological problems, or both; (4) engages in compulsive drug-seeking behavior; and (5) needs a constant increasing level of dosage of the drug to get \"high\". 7~ Treatment programs should conduct program design in the fight of recent research that has observed that (1) drug use occurs within a broader family of social and psychological problems, (2) cognitive-behavioral abilities are fundamentally psychological in nature, (3) the motivation to change is a cognitive-behavioral process, and (4) the skills and the relationship between the client and the individual counselor has an impact on final outcome. 72 State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 37 Program designers should consider the biochemical as well as the cognitive- behavioral aspects of addiction when designing drug addiction treatment modalities. Virtually \"all drugs.., have common effects, either directly or indirectly, on a single pathway deep within the brain. ''7~ In regard to the effect of heroin on the brain, research has found that heroin focuses on the opioid receptors of the brain. As previously noted TM the pleasure ~om opiates \"can be more powerfully rewarding than that produced by natural reinforcers. ''75 This assessment is significant in the study of how and why drug addiction is developed and maintained through positive and negative reinforcement. In studies dealing with positive and negative reinforcement, it is believed that if pleasure responses can be secured artificially a person will choose the artificial stimulation even over natural positive stimulation such as food or sex. The \"process in which a pleasure-inducing action becomes repetitive is called positive reinforcement. Conversely, abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, opiates, and other psychoactive drugs following chronic use.., results in discomfort and craving. The motivation to use a substance in order to avoid discomfort is called negative reinforcement. Positive reinforcement is believed to be controlled by various neurotransmitter systems, whereas negative reinforcement is believed to be the result of adaptations produced by chronic use within the same neurotrammitter systems. ''76 The use of heroin creates both positive and negative reinforcement through its processing within the brain. The heroin acts as an exogenous opiate within the brain and acts as a neurotransmitter for pleasure within the brain. The heroin produces a stronger pleasure reaction than endogenous opioids (endorphins and enkephalim). The chronic use of exogenous opiates within the pleasure seeking system drives the need for the exogenous opiate and the opioid receptors are now only stimulated by the exogenous opiate rather than by natural pleasure stimuli. \"Natural reinforcers such as food, drink, and sex [which] activate [pleasure] pathways in the brain [are replaced by exogenous opiates] as surrogates of the natural reinforcers. ''77 It is also believed that the use of these opiates and the negative reinforcement they produce (the need for the opiates to avoid pain due to lack of presence of the opiate) are aided by other natural occurring neurotransmitters in the brain, such i l I I l I I I I I ! i I I I I State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 38 I I I I ! i ! I i I I l I ! ! I I i as dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine produces immediate feelings of pleasure and elation that reinforce certain behaviors such as eating or sex and motivates repetition of these activities. 7s Dopamine is believed to be produced with the use of opiates. \"Serotonin is associated with the reinforcing effects of many abused drugs through its mood regulating and anxiety reducing effects. Low levels of serotonin are associated with depression and anxiety. ''79 The lack of stimulation by opioid receptors are believed to be a cause for low levels of dopamine and serotonin. The lack of these two chemicals are thought to produce depression which intern produce the craving for the heroin to relieve feelings of depression and the restoration of feeling pleasure or at least feeling \"normal.\" This biochemical change within the brain is compounded by cognitive-behavioral issues, namely the cycle of addiction and compulsive and impulsive drug use. The cycle of addiction is started by positive reinforcement and then driven by negative reinforcement. Heroin produces a strong pleasure effect and cognitively the user decides to use the drug again to receive the same pleasurable effect. The opioid receptors of the brain become addicted to the presence of the heroin and then requires the heroin stimulation continuously. Here is where negative reinforcement takes control. The user no longer takes the heroin to feel pleasure, but takes heroin in order to feel \"normal.\" The purpose in taking the heroin is to avoid painful sensations not to enjoy pleasurable sensations. During drug treatment the addict will desire to take heroin on two levels. Impulsive use will occur due to cues in the environment or by memories of taking the drug. The addict takes the drug almost without thinking about the consequences. Compulsive drug use occurs due to the addict obsessing over the pleasure gained by the drug. The addict thinks about the drug and the thoughts drive the addicts to relapse. The use ofnaltrexone addresses the results of heroin use due to impulsive and compulsive behavior, s\u00b0 But the issue treatment programs need to contend with is the cognitive behavior of addicts in that they decide that life without heroin is not desirable and simply choose to stop taking the naltrexone so they can enjoy the pleasure of the heroin. The treatment therapy must create new cognitive pathways within the brain to allow for controlling of cravings for the heroin and behavior patters to deal with the social factors of their lives. Since human beings State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council Research and Evaluation Unit SODAT SNAP May 1999 Outcome Evaluation Page 39 have the ability to cognitively choose to do or not do something, drug treatment programs need to focus on how the individual addict handles life stressors and training the addict to resort to socially positive alternatives to stress reduction rather than resorting to the use of heroin. The biochemical and cognitive-behavioral aspects of drug addiction presents the criminal justice system with political as well as social policy issues. The criminal justice system needs to contend with the implications of the fact that drug addicts have altered brain chemistry, while maintaining its inherent purpose of focusing on individual accountability and responsibility. Conversely, drug treatment designers and drug addiction scientists must contend with the fact that personal responsibility and accountability will always be a demand of policy makers and the public regardless of the science of addiction. It has been asserted that the prolonged drug use \"causes pervasive changes in the brain [and] the addicted brain is distinctly different from the non addicted brain\" and this fact leads to the conclusion that on general policy level \"the addicted individual must be dealt with as if he or she is in a different brain state. ''sl In other words, treat drug addicts as those whose minds have been \"altered fundamentally by drugs. ''s2 Although the literature is settled on the fact that addiction causes changes in the brain, there is some debate on the cause of addiction. For example, O'Brien defined addiction as acts of \"a chronic disease produced by thousands of exposures to drugs. Each drug taking episode activates specific brain structures, leaving a memory trace the persists long after the drug has disappeared from the body. ''s3 Goodman, explains that addiction is not formed by repeated use of a drug, but develops through a combination of environmental and genetic characteristics, s4 Heyman, while agreeing that \"changes in brain function alter voluntary behavior,\" notes that addiction is still a behavior of which social and economic costs can persuade addicts to end their addiction, s5 HeYman asserts that there are two types of addicts, those who take drugs voluntarily and those who do so involuntarily. The former Can be persuaded cognitively but the later will \"not be persuaded by costs and incentives to stop using them. ''s60'Bden, asserts that three factors should be kept in mind when considering addition and how to deal with addicts; (1) the availability of the drug and its cost and purity; (2) the genetic predisposition of the addict; I l I i l I I I I ! ! I I I I I State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 40 I I I I I I I I I I I I ! I I I I I I and (3) the applicable social and environmental pressures on the addict to continue or stop drug USe. 87 Although neuroscientists are convinced that addiction is a biological issue involving brain damage, \"the more common view is that drug addicts are weak.., unwilling to lead moral lives and to control their behavior and gratifications. ''ss Although Leslmer overstates the point, there is value in the common belief that human beings think and thus can control their behavior. The mere fact that one has damaged his/her brain and formed neuropathways for certain stimuli does not mean that the ability to choose has been destroyed. The fact that human beings have the ability to think, learn (form new neuropathways), and choose between behaviors seems to acknowledged as an a~erthought by some of the literature on addiction. The political (used here to mean philosophy) view that behavior is a cognitively controlled activity that is at least equal in the cause and maintenance of addictive behavior needs to considered by treatment program designers and neuroscientists. Those who make political policy may not be aware or care about the science of addiction, espec!ally if the idea of personal responsibility is not reflected in theories of addiction. For example, Congress has recently restricted social security payments and other social benefits from those who have drug addictions, s9 Both the science of addiction and personal responsibility add to the issue of addiction and addiction treatment. As noted by Heyman, three factors should be kept in mind when trying to understand addiction; \"[1] drug use in addicts can be altered by the proper arrangements of costs and benefits, [2] addictive drugs reduce options but do not eliminate choice, and [3] the biology of addiction is the biology of voluntary behavior.

Conditioned abstinence (\"craving\") can be elicited by ace/dental encounters with active addicts.., or other major stress.\" Id. On the issue of bchavior, Goldstein noted that humans have the ability to \"anticipate consequences and to modify our behavior accordingly. In this connection, the observation that naltrexone can diminish 'craving' is entirely understandable, since 'craving' is generally elicited by the possibility of obtaining a drug rather than by its unavailability. It follows from this analysis that nal~'exone can only work ffthe patient understands how it works and believes that it will work.\" Id. at 159 - 160. Goldstein also asserted that because the patient knows that the naI~exone will block the effects of heroin and thus taking the drug will be futile, \"it is not surprising that many subjects taking neltrexone may not use heroin to test and verify the protection.\" Id at 159.

PROGRESS IN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY 7(4-6): 591 - 597. 42 In the development of the cycle of addiction, the intake of heroin leads to an increase in opioid receptor activity. \"Once opioid receptor activity has been primed, more [heroin] is needed to ensure continued opioid receptor activity. Therefore, a cycle may ensue during which the desire to increase or recapture feelings of pleasuro or euphoria is translated into cravings for [the heroin]. The loss of conlzol that follows the initial consumption of a reinforcing agent [the heroin] may provide the root mechanism for.., addictive behavior.\" SAMI-ISA, Supra note 31 at 31 - 32. Thus the use of heroin can have a \"priming\" for additional use. The use of heroin, even a small amount, can effect a release of endorphins (which produce feelings of pleasure) which in turn increase the desire for more heroin which in turn produce more release of endorphins. Addiction research has found \"that opiates can have an effect equal to that of having an appetizer before dinner. A small dose of a substance that effects the opiate receptor sites can increase the drive to consume more of the same.\" The first ingestion of the heroin increases the motivation to have another.

As noted in endaotes 31 and 42, the consumption of heroin produces a pleasurable experience that can be stronger than natural pleasurable experiences. The experience in turn produces chemical reinforce~ to the use of heroin. The re\u00a2lu, ction or stopping of the behavior (heroin use) produces the chemical reinforcers in the brain which in turn produce craving for the behavior (heroin use). The craving in turn produces the continuation of the behavior (heroin use). Negative reinforcement and addiction are achieved. Treau~ent programs using naltroxone block the pleasure re, action of opiates and opinids in the brain. But the psychological desire for the heroin and the resulting pleasure from using the drug causes the person to stop taking the naltrexone in order State of Delaware Criminal Justice Council SODAT SNAP Outcome Evaluation Research and Evaluation Unit May 1999 Page 44 to have the heroin have its desired effect.

It has been asserted that lreatment programs are destined for failure because they don't consider the multifaeeted factors of why is the treatment is being offered, the difference between treamaent and therapy, why an addict is seeking treatment, who is offering the u-eatment, and why the addict has an addiction. Additionally, the lack ofapecific and meaningful goal setting for the individual addict, the lack ofapecific diagnosis of the individual addict, the confusion of goals to help the addict become an effective patient with goals to make the patient a better ci6zan by improving his/her lifestyle, and confusing different theories of therapy and u'eatment modalities all help to create program design problems that lead to failure.

It has also been observed that since treaunent programs generally are not evaluated using random selection of patients and conu'ol groups, establishment of baseline measurements, and have reliabilily and validity limitations, the fact of high atlrition rates should not be the sole assessm~t of success.

O'Brien asserted that Drug exposures.., paired with environmental cues (persons, places, things).., acquire the ability to activate the same or complementary brain circuits even in the absence of the drug. Id. Drug-related cues alone have [been shown to produce] increases in limbic blood flow in formerly dependent cocaine users .... Drug cues have also produced increases in the metabolism of specific brain ereas, ld. at 1196. This explains why addiction is considered to be a chronic diseas~ Although the use of drugs has ended, pathways and brain chemistry have been altered so as to produce the effects of the \"disease\" although the agent causing the disease is no longer present. Although this chemical analysis may be u'ue, the choice of whether to indulge in an impulse or compulsive need (chemically created or not) is not destroyed. One still chooses to indulge a desire and one choof/es to fxequent an area that provides those cues of addiction I I i I I I I I I I !

Goodman goes on to say the following: I would describe addiction as a chronic condition that develops through a process that involves complex interactions over tome between genetic and environmental factors. More specifically, I would propose that two sets of determinants are involved in the development of an addictive disorder: I) those that concern underlying nemobiological abnormalities that are shared by all addictive disorders and 2) Those that relate to the selection of a particular substance as the one that is preferred for addictive use. I would add thal each set includes both genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors in The development of the underlying neurobiological abnormalities include deficiencies in the child's caregiving environment during the first years of life, when the maturing brain is mosa sensitive to external influences and depends on particular qualities of interchange with the caregiving enviroment for healthy development Genetic factors in selection include genetically based variations in 1) the sensitivity of the reward system to different substances, 2) the body's sensitivity to immediate aversive consequences of using a substance (such as flushing or standing alaxia alter ingestion of alcohol), and 3) the intensity of the individual's se~asitivity to various painful affects [which is] associated with.., negative reinforcement 85 He3anun, G.
