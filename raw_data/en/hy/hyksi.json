By signing the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) [COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccination-provider-support.html) to receive and dispense vaccines, providers are committing to being accountable for the conditions specified in the agreement. In addition to the terms specified in the Provider Agreement, all organizations and providers participating in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program are expected to adhere to the following CDC guidelines. COVID-19 vaccine providers: - Must administer COVID-19 vaccine at no out-of-pocket cost to the recipient - May not deny anyone vaccination based on the vaccine recipient's coverage status or network status - May not charge an office visit or other fee if COVID-19 vaccination is the sole medical service provided - May not require additional medical services to receive COVID-19 vaccination - May not seek any reimbursement, including through balance billing, from the vaccine recipient - May seek appropriate reimbursement from a program or plan that covers COVID-19 vaccine administration fees for the vaccine recipient, such as: - Vaccine recipient's private insurance company - Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement DHS is collaborating with our federal and state partners to closely monitor provider program compliance and billing practices. This includes investigating all instances of inappropriate billing and fraud reported by Wisconsinites, conducting analyses of COVID-19 vaccine administration data, and initiating CDC-required on-site visits. Getting paid for COVID-19 vaccine administration Each COVID-19 vaccine product and dose has its own CPT code. Use these codes when requesting reimbursement from patients' private insurance or Medicare. See the American Academy of Pediatrics' [COVID-19 Vaccine Administration: Getting Paid](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/covid-19-vaccine-for-children/covid-19-vaccine-administration-getting-paid/) webpage for a list of all COVID-19 vaccine billing codes and more information. Medicare COVID-19 vaccination for residents of small long-term care facilities See information on [Medicare payment for COVID-19 vaccine administration](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/covid-19/medicare-covid-19-vaccine-shot-payment) - including a list of billing codes, payment allowances and effective dates. Report inappropriate billing practices and denied access to COVID-19 vaccine Individuals aware of any potential violations of these requirements are encouraged to report them to DHS. - The public can file a complaint by calling 844-684-1064 (toll-free). The public can also report fraud, waste, and abuse of all other public funds to DHS through the fraud hotline at 877-865-3432 or through the [fraud reporting website.](https://www.reportfraud.wisconsin.gov/rptfrd/default.aspx) - Vaccinators can email [DHSCovidVaccinator@dhs.wisconsin.gov](mailto:DHSCovidVaccinator@dhs.wisconsin.gov)to file a complaint. Vaccination sites must maintain their Vaccines.gov profile. DHS strongly recommends that vaccinators ensure their profiles are publicly viewable on Vaccines.gov so that the public can use this resource to find COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccinators need to provide public-facing information. Effective August 2, 2023, vaccinators must report inventory data from Wisconsin Immunization Registry (WIR) to Vaccines.gov as well as provide vaccine type and in-stock inventory data. DHS will continue to report site address information on behalf of vaccinators. It is very important for all vaccinators to keep their inventory up to date in WIR so the public has current information when choosing a vaccinator. Please note, Vaccines.gov only displays whether the vaccine is in-stock, it does not display inventory numbers. Ensuring your profile is viewable After enrolling as a COVID-19 vaccinator, the organization email account listed under Part A of your Provider Agreement should have received an email from [vaccinefinder@auth.castlighthealth.com](mailto:vaccinefinder@auth.castlighthealth.com) inviting you to create a COVID Locating Health Provider Portal Account on Vaccines.gov. This invitation expired after 7 days. To request an email invitation be resent to your organization, please email [cars_helpdesk@cdc.gov](mailto:cars_helpdesk@cdc.gov) from your organization email account listed under Part A of your Provider Agreement or by calling 1-833-748-1979. If your organization email needs to be changed, you must fully complete and resubmit a Form A by logging into the COVID-19 Vaccinator Enrollment Tool. Once your organization is registered with Vaccines.gov, you can set up the reporting structure for your organization. There are two options: - Under the organizational-level maintenance setup, the Part A contact (Organization contact) would be required to manage the details for the public profiles of all locations and only the Part A contact. - If the organization wishes to delegate the control of profile information to each location, they should set site-level maintenance. If the organization contact designates site-level reporting, this triggers registration emails to be sent to the site-level vaccine coordinators listed in section B of the Provider Agreement (primary and backup contacts). After registration is completed, the coordinators for each location would be able to log in independently and manage details for that specific location. The CDC and Vaccines.gov provides resources for vaccinators. For password resets or general account/login-related questions, contact the CDC's Vaccines.gov team at [CARS_HelpDesk@cdc.gov.](mailto:CARS_HelpDesk@cdc.gov) Your location will be findable on Vaccines.gov if your location has vaccines in stock and you have [set the location to be publicly viewable.](https://vaccine-resources.gitbook.io/vaccines.gov-provider-resources/enter-location-info) Note: only the first 50 results are shown so larger cities may not show all possible locations that match. Support The CDC and Vaccines.gov offer several resources for vaccinators. Reviewing the [Vaccines.gov COVID-19 Vaccine Provider Process Overview](https://vaccines-gov.gitbook.io/vaccines.gov-provider-resources/process-overview) webpage is recommended. Please email [DHSCovidVaccinator@wi.gov](mailto:DHSCovidVaccinator@dhs.wisconsin.gov?subject=Vaccines.gov) with the subject Vaccines.gov. A DHS representative will respond within one to three business days. If your location is no longer administering COVID-19 vaccines, please contact [DHSCovidVaccinator@wi.gov](mailto:DHSCovidVaccinator@dhs.wisconsin.gov?subject=Vaccines.gov) to request inactivation. For all other support including password resets, or general account/login-related questions, please contact the Vaccines.gov help desk at 833-748-1979 or email at [CARS_HelpDesk@cdc.gov.](mailto:cars_helpdesk@cdc.gov) Key WIR resources: [WIR training videos](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8701436) covering the following topics: - Managing sites - Managing clinicians - Managing transfers - Inventory management - Mass vaccination function Webinar recordings with WIR information [Document vaccines received outside of the US in WIR](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8511959/video/674951482#t=20m38s)starting at minute 20:38 [Changing expiration dates in WIR](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8511959/video/669922188#t=20m12s)starting at minute 20:12 management](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8511959/video/552007308) [Correcting immunization data in client records](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8511959/video/547992515) [Entering historical and new COVID-19 doses in WIR](https://vimeo.com/545980671) [Updating your shipping confirmation email address in WIR](https://vimeo.com/545980684) [Reminder/recall report feature in WIR](https://vimeo.com/647875656) Call 608-266-9691 or email [dhswirhelp@dhs.wisconsin.gov](mailto:dhswirhelp@dhs.wisconsin.gov) for additional assistance from the WIR Help Desk. Reminder/recall notices in WIR Reminder/recall report functions assist providers with outreach to their patients. Providers can send reminder notices to clients who have an immunization due soon to remind them to call and schedule an appointment. Recall notices are used for those clients who are overdue for a vaccine. You can review this information in a [video about the WIR reminder recall/report feature.](https://vimeo.com/647875656) Vaccinators should consider connecting with their local and tribal health department about how to reach key community-based organizations in their area or reach out directly to organizations. For more information and guidance for community-based and at-home vaccination visit: [COVID-19: Vaccine Partner and Vaccinator Resources.](/covid-19/vaccine-resources.htm) Vaccination clinical guidance DHS recommends that everyone 6 months and older stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines. Wisconsin Immunization Registry verification Vaccinators are encouraged to check the Wisconsin Immunization Registry (WIR) and/or a patient's CDC vaccination card before administering a vaccine to verify that individuals are receiving the correct vaccine based on the specific vaccination schedule for their age group and/or medical history. Vaccine cards are not required to get a COVID-19 vaccine dose. DHS urges vaccinators to administer a COVID-19 vaccine even if a patient does not have a COVID-19 vaccine card with them. DHS cannot issue COVID-19 vaccination cards. For more information on vaccination record cards, visit: [Your CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Record and Vaccination Card.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Fvaccination-card.html#vaccination-card) Resources [CDC Interim Clinical Considerations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html) - Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) fact sheets Observation period Individuals receiving any vaccine, including COVID-19, need to be monitored for allergic reactions for 15-30 minutes after vaccination. Non-reactions to previous vaccinations are not a guarantee that a reaction will not occur. When administering doses, please make sure people wait before they leave your site. COVID-19, influenza, and other vaccines may be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines on the same day, as well as co-administration within 14 days. Giving all vaccines for which an individual is eligible at the same visit is considered a best practice as it increases the probability that individual will be up to date on recommended vaccines. It also is an important part of immunization practice, especially if a health care provider is uncertain that a patient will return for additional doses of vaccine. Please reference [CDC's clinical considerations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#:~:text=Coadministration%20of%20COVID%2D19%20vaccines) for more details. CDC's short, recorded webinar on [Administering More Than One Vaccine on the Same Day](https://www2.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/covid19/videos/simultaneous/simultaneous.asp) reviews the clinical considerations, best practices and clinical resources for simultaneous administration. You can also print out Immunize.org's job aid, [How to Administer Multiple Intramuscular Vaccines to Adults During One Visit.](https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2030.pdf) Vaccinators need to ensure that emergency equipment is available regardless of the vaccine being administered. This includes epinephrine auto-injectors or epinephrine. If an ampule of epinephrine and needle/syringe is to be used, it is important that the provider be proficient in drawing up and [administering the proper dosage.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/adverse-reactions.html#:~:text=TABLE%205-1%3A%20Rapid%20overview) [ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/adverse-reactions.html#:~:text=Epinephrine%20and%20equipment%20for%20managing%20an%20airway%20should%20be%20available%20for%20immediate%20use) read, \"Epinephrine and equipment for managing an airway should be available for immediate use.\" According to the CDC, state laws establish vaccination requirements for school-aged children. In Wisconsin, the age of majority is 18 years of age, unless emancipated. Therefore, all unemancipated individuals under 18 years of age require parent or guardian consent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. In Wisconsin, vaccinators can accept written or verbal (such as via telephone) consent to administer the COVID-19 vaccine from a minor's legal parent or guardian who cannot be present at the time of vaccination. Vaccinators are not required to accept written or verbal consent but are permitted to accept these forms of consent should they choose to do so. DHS does not have a sample written consent form for vaccinators to use. Vaccinators are encouraged to work with their own legal counsel regarding methods of consent for vaccinating minors in their clinic. Vaccine providers are responsible for adhering to all requirements outlined in the CDC [COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccination-provider-support.html) This applies to COVID-19 vaccines either authorized or approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Accordingly, use of these products outside of those that have been approved and authorized by FDA (off-label use) is not recommended. People who are pregnant or recently pregnant should take steps to protect themselves from getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older, including people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future. If you are pregnant and have questions about getting a vaccination, find more information by visiting [Pregnant and Recently Pregnant People.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnant-people.html#anchor_1623351182596) Increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in the United States after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, particularly in adolescents and young adults. CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 6 months and older, given the risk of COVID-19 illness and related, possibly severe complications, such as long-term health problems, hospitalization, and even death. Vaccination is important because the risk of myocarditis or pericarditis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is greater than the risk of myocarditis or pericarditis occurring after receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents and adults. However, people who develop myocarditis or pericarditis after a dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine generally should not receive a subsequent dose of any COVID-19 vaccine. For more information see [COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis and pericarditis.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#myocarditis-pericarditis) Health care providers should consider myocarditis in an evaluation of chest pain after vaccination and [report all cases to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)](https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html) in a timely manner. The [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)](https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html) is a national vaccine safety surveillance program that has been used to detect possible safety issues with vaccines for many decades. Anyone can, but medical providers must, report adverse events (possible side effects or health problems) that occur after vaccination using VAERS. It is a requirement that you submit all vaccine administration errors and adverse events to [VAERS.](https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html) Be sure to familiarize yourself with the specific EUA reporting requirements including: - Vaccine administration errors whether or not associated with an adverse event - Serious adverse events (irrespective of attribution to vaccination) - Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults - Cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. Health care personnel or health departments in the U.S. can request a consultation from the [Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) COVIDVax](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/cisa/index.html) project for a complex COVID-19 vaccine safety question about an individual patient residing in the U.S. not readily addressed by CDC guidance. Request a consultation from CISA by: Calling 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636) Submitting a request via a [web form](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/cisa/index.html) For more information about vaccine safety, review [What Every Clinician Should Know about COVID-19 Vaccine Safety.](https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2020/callinfo_121420.asp) You can also read more about current data on adverse events, local and system reactions to [Moderna](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/moderna/reactogenicity.html) and [Pfizer](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html) COVID-19 vaccines.

Every individual counts, and we need to leverage every opportunity to vaccinate to the fullest. Vaccine wastage reporting process Only report COVID-19 vaccine wastage to the [Wastage Form, F-02768](/forms/f02768.pdf) if the doses expired per the actual expiration date. - Check posted manufacturer information for the most up to date expiration/extension information for [Pfizer-BioNTech,](https://lotexpiry.cvdvaccine.com/) [Moderna,](https://modernacovid19global.com/vial-lookup#vialLookUpTool)and [Novavax](https://us.novavaxcovidvaccine.com/hcp)COVID-19 vaccines. Manage your vaccine inventory and [update the expiration dates accordingly in WIR](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8511959/video/669922188#t=20m12s)when there is an extension. - If the doses are expired per the expiration date, fill out the [Wastage Form, F-02768](/forms/f02768.pdf)for the COVID-19 vaccine that has passed its expiration date. These expired doses should not be reported in WIR. - Email the Wastage form to the [DHSCovidVaccinator@wi.gov](mailto:DHSCovidVaccinator@wi.gov?subject=EXPIRED)and put \"EXPIRED\" in the subject line of the email. Report all other COVID-19 vaccine wastage to WIR (but do not fill out a wastage form) if doses are: - Gone past the [beyond-use date (BUD).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6bw1N_iMu8&t=38s) - BUD is different from the expiration date and is defined as the amount of time allowed by the manufacturer for a vaccine to be used after being punctured, reconstituted, or moved from a freezer to a refrigerator. - Vial punctured, but not used in appropriate timeframe per manufacturer instructions - Enter as Doses Wasted in WIR with the Reason: Open Vial, Not all Doses Administered. - Unpunctured vial past its BUD - Enter these as Doses Wasted in WIR. Use the Reason: \"Other\" code and enter \"BUD\" in the description. - Vial punctured, but not used in appropriate timeframe per manufacturer instructions - Do not replace the expiration date in WIR with the BUD. - Mark the BUD on the package or vial when changing storage temperature and note the beyond-use date and time once the vial is first punctured. - When vaccine expires per the BUD, it is entered as wastage in WIR. - See the [COVID-19 Vaccine: Quick Reference Guide](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/covid19-vaccine-quick-reference-guide-2pages.pdf)for more information about BUDs. - BUD is different from the expiration date and is defined as the amount of time allowed by the manufacturer for a vaccine to be used after being punctured, reconstituted, or moved from a freezer to a refrigerator. - Unable to be drawn from a vial. - Enter these as Doses Wasted in WIR. Use the Reason: \"Other\" code and enter \"only able to administer 'x' doses from vial\" in the description. - Calculate waste by counting the total number of doses administered, regardless of volume or series, and subtracting this from the total number of identified doses in the vial. Standard doses per vial - number of vaccines administered = waste - Always report wastage in full doses based on the volume identified on the label. Never report wastage in half doses. - Spoiled due to temperature excursions. - The vaccines that were exposed to out-of-range temperatures must be labeled \"do not use\" and stored at the required temperature until further information on usability can be gathered or further instruction on disposition or recovery is received. - The temperature excursions must also be reported to the manufacturers. - Never use the \"Doses spoiled\" code in WIR for COVID-19 vaccines as that data does not get reported to CDC. If doses are spoiled (exposed to temperature excursions), enter them as Doses Wasted in WIR. Use the Reason: Other code and enter \"temperature excursion\" in the description. - Not able to be used for any other reason. - If vaccine doses are left unused for any other reason, enter them as Doses Wasted in WIR. Use the Reason: \"Other\" code and write a brief description in the free text box. COVID-19 vaccine never gets returned to the state regardless of expiration date or wastage reason. It should always be disposed of per the facility's policy. Refer to CDC's [Identifying, Disposing, and Reporting COVID-19 Vaccine Wastage webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/hcp/wastage-operational-summary.html) for additional guidance. This waste management guidance should not be used for non-COVID-19 vaccines, which are covered under other CDC vaccination programs. Please remember to: - Promptly add administered doses to [WIR.](/immunization/wir-healthcare-providers.htm) - Update inventory daily in WIR. - Check inventory for accurate expiration dates and update in WIR. - Do not stockpile; order only what you need. - Use the [Wisconsin COVID-19 Vaccine Exchange](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=102895be169146c4b69c1a9115346878)to reduce wastage and to assist DHS in monitoring statewide vaccine availability and supply. Inventory management To better maintain vaccine storage space, providers are encouraged to: - Inventory status must be reconciled daily in accordance with your COVID-19 provider agreement. [Update your inventory in WIR](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8701436/video/545989184)at the close of each business day to ensure that your physical inventory count matches your WIR inventory. This ensures the publicly posted amount on Vaccines.gov reflects actual inventory on hand. This will help to reduce confusion and assist the public in identifying a location where they can receive a vaccine. - Stay aware of expiration dates and plan ahead to redistribute vaccine, if needed. - Mark the beyond-use date on the package or vial when changing storage temperature and note the beyond-use date and time once the vial is first punctured. - Monitor expiration dates weekly, rotate stock as needed, and follow a \"first in, first out\" strategy to manage inventory. - If nearing expiration, check posted manufacturer information for the most up to date expiration/extension information for [Pfizer-BioNTech,](https://lotexpiry.cvdvaccine.com/) [Moderna,](https://modernacovid19global.com/vial-lookup#vialLookUpTool)and [Novavax](https://us.novavaxcovidvaccine.com/hcp)COVID-19 vaccine lots. - Redistribute vaccine to other providers by posting COVID-19 vaccine on the [Wisconsin COVID-19 Vaccine Exchange.](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=102895be169146c4b69c1a9115346878)Vaccine supply cannot be returned to DHS. It can only be redistributed to other enrolled providers. - Reduce vaccine ordering, reduce inventory, and place orders on an \"as-needed\" basis. - In most instances, vaccine orders of existing COVID-19 vaccines can be delivered within 48 hours. - Assess storage space to determine freezer and refrigerator capacity before placing orders for vaccine, considering anticipated flu vaccine inventory as appropriate. - Remove expired vaccine from the storage unit immediately, based on the latest expiration information. Do not give staff the opportunity to administer expired vaccine. - If expired vaccine is inadvertently administered, it is considered a vaccine administration error and requires remediation including a [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)](https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html)report, contacting the recipient to inform them of the error, and may or may not require revaccination based on the manufacturers' guidance. See CDC's guidance on [vaccine administration errors and deviations.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-c) - Vaccine disposal: dispose of the vaccine vial (with any remaining vaccine) and packaging as medical waste according to your facility's policy. COVID-19 vaccine does not get returned to the state. Do not return vaccine in the thermal shipping container. - If expired vaccine is inadvertently administered, it is considered a vaccine administration error and requires remediation including a The printed information on COVID-19 vaccine packaging may be different from what will be stated on the EUA fact sheets.
