[The recall involves roughly 8 million](https://www.thelaundressrecall.com/) laundry detergents, fabric conditioners, and other cleaning products, according to a [notice posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2023/The-Laundress-Recalls-Laundry-Detergent-and-Household-Cleaning-Products-Due-to-Risk-of-Exposure-to-Bacteria). The Laundress [first issued a safety notice on Nov. 17](https://www.instagram.com/p/ClFDd4iuoU5/?hl=en), saying it had identified \"the potential presence of elevated levels of bacteria in some of our products that present a safety concern.\" On Thursday, the voluntary recall was issued. The Laundress said testing identified bacteria in certain products, including those produced between January 2021 and September 2022. Specifically, the company said bacteria like Burkholderia cepacia complex, Klebsiella aerogenes and multiple different species of Pseudomonas were detected. The Laundress surface cleaner, all-purpose cleaning concentrate, dish detergent, glass & mirror cleaner, aromatherapy dish soap and aromatherapy surface cleaner.

Pseudomonas is a type of bacteria that is found commonly in the environment, like in soil and in water, according to [the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/pseudomonas.html#:~:text=Of%20the%20many%20different%20types,of%20the%20body%20after%20surgery.). There are many different types of Pseudomonas, but the one that most often causes infections in humans is called Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the CDC said \u2014 which noted how it can cause infections in the blood, lungs (pneumonia), or other parts of the body after surgery. To date, the company said it's aware of 11 people who reported Pseudomonas infections and is investigating to see if there is any connection to the recalled products.
