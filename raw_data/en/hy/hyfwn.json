But if the book is titled Infinite Mind: Science of the Human Vibrations of Consciousness and if one of its chapters announces as its topic \"The Human Aura: Living Vibrations Brought to Light,\" perhaps there is reason to take a second look. \"Too often we scientists get lost in our data,\" observes Valerie V. Hunt, \"forgetting that the essence of science is careful observation, deep thought, and wise deductions from both reasoning AND the exercise of mystical and dreamlike states.\" With a declared background in neurophysiology and psychology as well as teaching experience at Columbia University, the University of Iowa, and UCLA, Hunt invites readers both lay and scientific: \"Come with me on a journey of discovery into the research of the vibrant human aura that you can follow and understand. For scientists, my reasoning, although broad and penetrating\u2014and sometimes mystical\u2014is based upon scientific facts and clinical observations.\" - Type - Research Article - Information [Religion and Culture](/core/journals/religion-and-american-culture), [Volume 10](/core/journals/religion-and-american-culture/volume/A8F2A99E174AEA6F5AE48690FD71EBFC), [Issue 1](/core/journals/religion-and-american-culture/issue/4A7CAA1BCF4BB9A3D89FE83602F26F82), Winter 2000 pp. 29 - 55 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 Center for the Study of Religion and American Culture 2000 References Notes 1.

Conventional accounts of present-day religion have, for some time, pointed to religion functioning as therapy for hosts of believers and therapy functioning as religion.
