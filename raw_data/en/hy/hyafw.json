Driven primarily by very strong demand it has expanded, consolidated and globalised over the past 15 years in countries of all income levels. Livestock is fundamental to the livelihoods of about one billion of the world's poorest people. Rural poultry, in particular, is essential for the livelihood of many resource-poor farmers often being the only asset they possess. It makes up about 80 percent of poultry stocks in low-income food-deficit countries and significantly contributes to: (i) improving human nutrition, providing food (eggs and meat) with high quality nutrients and micronutrients; (ii) generating a small income and savings, especially for women, thus enhancing the capacity to cope with shocks and reducing economic vulnerability; (iii) providing manure for vegetable garden and crop production. The importance of the socio-cultural and religious functions of village poultry production for smallholder livelihoods, beyond its economic or nutritional importance, is also widely recognized. This publication is a collection of short articles that give an overview of the benefits of poultry products and information about different aspects of their production. The articles are primarily written to provide information for a general audience rather than for technical experts in the concerned fields of specialization. Originally prepared as separate articles in 2011 for the FAO poultry production website they are compiled in this document for easy access and reference.The role of poultry in human nutrition Poul Try DeveloPmenT reviewMost eggs that are consumed in developing countries are produced by commercial layer breeds 2 Poultry DeveloPment review The role of poultry in human nutrition The role of poultry in human nutrition David Farrell, School of Land, Crops and Food Sciences, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia 4072, Queensland, Australia Chicken meat and eggs are the best source of quality protein, and are badly needed by the many millions of people who live in poverty. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia malnu- trition (poor nutrition) and undernutrition (inadequate nutrition) are closely associated with poverty. These conditions affect the immune system. The HIV/AIDS epidemic sweeping through coun- tries in SSA stems partly from extreme poverty and, with it, poor nutrition. wiDe varia Tion in consumPTion of Poul Try mea T anD eggs A recent survey of several countries found that 34 percent of the people surveyed in South Asia and 59 percent in SSA were suffering from severe energy deficiency (Smith and Wiseman, 2007). Both groups obtained 67 percent of their energy from sta- ple foods (cereal grains, grain legumes, starchy roots and tubers) containing small quantities of only low-quality protein. Their aver - age per capita egg consumption was only 42 per year, compared with a global average of 153. Stunting and wasting in children under five years of age, and slow mental development were seen mainly in rural areas of SSA. Eight out of ten of those affected were among the poor. Diseases such as kwashiorkor and mar - asmus, both seen in underweight children, are associated with inadequate dietary energy and protein. Pregnant and lactating women and young children are particularly vulnerable. In SSA, only 8 percent of dietary energy comes from animal protein, compared with an average of 17 percent in all develop- ing countries, and 28 percent in China. chicken mea T anD eggs: a valuable source of ProTein anD almosT all of The essenTial nuTrienTs Chicken meat and eggs provide not only high-quality protein, but also important vitamins and minerals. Worldwide, 2 billion peo- ple depend on rice as their staple food. Most eat polished white rice stripped of many essential fats, the B complex vitamins and several minerals. Other cereal grains are usually deficient in criti- cal nutrients. For example, maize (corn) is a staple food in some regions, but the niacin it contains is unavailable. Maize consump- tion without supplements causes pellagra. Invariably the protein content of grains is low and of poor quality. Net protein utiliza- tion (NPU) is an index of protein quality, calculated by multiplying protein digestibility by biological value. NPU of grains is generally less than 40. Rice is the exception, with NPU of about 60, but it is low in protein (7.5 percent). NPU of chicken eggs is 87. Generally, cereals lack the most important amino acids for humans - lysine, threonine, the sulphur-bearing amino acids (methionine and cysteine) and occasionally tryptophan. Eggs and chicken meat are rich in these essential amino acids. Eggs are also high in lutein which lowers the risk of cataracts and macular degeneration, particularly among people living in developing countries. In the least developed countries, the projected increase in egg consumption between 2005 and 2015 is 26 percent, compared with only 2.4 percent in the most developed countries (Wind- hurst, 2008). Corresponding annual projections for poultry meat are 2.9 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively (FAOSTATS). aDvanT ages of chicken mea T anD eggs comP areD To oTher animal ProTeins In developing countries, the diet of people living in cities usually contains more animal protein than that of rural people, mainly because urban people are more prosperous, but also because they generally have access to a wider variety of foods at local mar - kets. In low-income countries, commercially produced chicken meat is well placed to satisfy the demands of a rapidly increasing affluent, middle class who can afford to pay for broiler chickens. Facilities and infrastructure for producing broiler chickens can be established quickly and soon start generating. Not only is chicken meat seen as a healthy meat, but it is also the cheapest of all livestock meats. A major advantage of eggs and poultry meat as human food is that there are no major taboos on their consumption. In addition, a chicken provides a meal for the average family without the need for a refrigerator to store left-overs. Meat from other livestock such as pigs and cattle is kept mainly for special festive occasions and celebrations, partly because of a lack of storage facilities (no refrigerator or electricity supply). Eggs can be purchased relatively Photo Credit: Flavio Oliveira3 Poultry DeveloPment review The role of poultry in human nutritioncheaply and in small numbers. One egg is almost a meal in itself and when hard-boiled will last for several weeks. It can be taken to school safely by children for lunch. scavenging chickens ProviDe cheaP eggs anD mea T Scavenging family poultry provide much-needed protein and in- come, and contribute to food security for many families living in poor rural regions of developing countries. The eggs and meat produced by their own or neighbours' small poultry flocks are the only eggs and poultry meat that the majority of these families are ever likely to eat. This makes family poultry increasingly important as the world's population pushes towards 7 billion people. Fur - thermore, it is not difficult to improve the nutritional value of the egg, to become a functional food. conclusions Poultry has a major role to play in developing countries. Produce is relatively inexpensive and widely available. The commercial poultry industry provides employment and is growing rapidly. To produce 1 kg of meat from a commercial broiler chicken only about 1.7 kg of feed is needed. Poultry production has a less detrimental impact on the environment than other livestock, and uses less water. Semi-scavenging backyard indigenous poultry are extremely important in providing income and high-quality protein in the diets of rural people whose traditional foods are typically rich in carbohydrate but low in protein. The vexed question of the cholesterol content of eggs and human health seems to have been exaggerated. references leskanich, c.o. & noble, r.c. 1997.

Breast meat contains less than 3 g fat/100 g. An average value for dark meat (skin off) is 5 to 7 g/100 g. About half of the fat from chicken meat is made up of the desirable monounsaturated fats, and only one-third of the less healthy sat- urated fats. There are much higher proportions of saturated fats in most cuts of red meat, which also vary considerably in total fat. Chicken meat is therefore seen as a healthy meat. Chicken meat does not contain the trans fats that contribute to coronary heart disease, and can be found in high amounts in beef and lamb. In Canada, values of 2 to 5 percent have been reported for beef and as high as 8 percent for lamb. The World Cancer Research Fund and others (Bingham, 2006) have suggested that the consumption of large amounts (more than 500 g/week) of red meat, particularly processed meat, but not chicken meat, may be unhealthy. Poul Try mea T is rich in The omega-3 fa Ts Poultry meat is an important provider of the essential polyunsat-urated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially the omega (n)-3 fatty acids. Scavenging chickens are a particularly good source because of their varied diet. The amounts of these important fatty acids can be increased more easily in chicken meat than in other livestock meats; so too can some trace minerals and vitamins. The recom- mended dietary intakes (RDIs) of niacin can be met with 100 g of chicken meat per day for adults and 50 g for infants. By feeding broiler chickens only small amounts of a sup- plement rich in alpha linoleic acid (an n-3 PUFA), such as flax seed, the n-3 PUFA in thigh meat can be increased from 86 mg to 283 mg/100 g, and that in the minced carcass from 93 to 400 mg/100 g. To a large extent, the fat contents of the differ - ent portions determine the content and enrichment of PUFAs, so dark chicken meat always contains more PUFAs than white breast meat. Poul Try mea T can be enricheD wiTh several of The imPor TanT DieT ary nuTrienTs Unlike most other meats, chicken meat can also easily be en- riched with several other important nutrients. A recent study (Yu et al., 2008) showed that by adding 0.24 mg of selenium (as organic selenium) per kilogram of feed, the selenium content of breast meat was increased from 8.6 g to 41 g/100g, which is more than 65 percent of the RDI. The same amount of selenium in the form of inorganic sodium selenite also increased selenium in the breast meat, but only to 16 g/100g. Selenium deficiency is becoming more widespread in humans because soils are becom- ing depleted and the foods grown on them are therefore lower in selenium. The RDI of selenium is 55 g per day. Selenium is a powerful antioxidant and plays a role in the prevention of some forms of cancer. A deficiency of selenium can cause Keshan's dis-ease, a heart ailment in the young, which is common in parts of China, and cognitive decline in adults. Enriched poultry meat could help alleviate this condition. conclusions Chicken meat can make many positive contributions to the diet of those on low incomes. Although not all meat is seen as healthy, chicken meat is, and is frequently more affordable than other meats. It is of a consistently high quality, is low in saturated fats, can be enriched with some essential nutrients and is sought after worldwide. references bingham, s. 2006.

Her diet might consist of a small amount of rice (50 g/day) but mainly sweet potato, taro, yams and cassava. Her family of five keeps a small flock of nine hens and a cockerel. These should produce approximately 12 eggs and one chicken, yielding 780 g of edible meat, each week. This will give each member of the family 22 g of meat a day, and the child receives five of the 12 eggs each week, or 36 g of edible egg per day. Table 1 shows the daily contribution that the eggs and meat make to the girl's recommended dietary intake (RDI) of some es- sential nutrients. These are mostly for a child of three to four years of age, but RDIs have not been determined for people living in developing countries and are likely to be generous (by perhaps 20 percent), especially if \"the law of diminishing returns\" applies to nutrient utilization, so that a low nutrient intake is used with greater efficiency, particularly from animal products. The eggs and meat will provide the girl with all the critical amino acids and vitamin K she needs, 30 percent of the RDI for folate, 66 percent for vitamin B12, 30 percent for biotin and 29 percent for iodine. Iron is especially important and often deficient, particularly in the diet of women in developing countries. It is known that the iron in meat and, to a lesser extent eggs, is highly available, unlike the iron in vegetables; the iron in the chicken meat and eggs in Table 1 is likely to meet more than 14 percent of the girl's daily requirement. folic aciD in Poul Try mea T anD eggs is esPecially imPor TanT During Pregnancy Folic acid deficiency is of major concern in almost all developing countries and has been shown to lead to neural tube defects. These can occur very early in pregnancy, resulting in severe de- fects of the brain and spinal cord, stillbirths and early child mortal- ity. A recent survey in Uttar Pradesh (India) (Cherian et al., 2005) found that neural tube defects ranged from 3.9 to 8.8 per 1 000 birth - the highest rate in the world. Green leafy vegetables and fruit are good sources of folic acid, but up to half can be lost in cooking. Assuming that she is not a vegetarian, the 45 g in the meat and eggs shown in Table 1, will provide a pregnant woman with 23 percent of her RDI for folic acid (200 g/day, although this figure varies widely). The folic acid concentration in eggs can be increased substantially by feeding hens a folic acid-enriched diet. The family also benefiTs from The DieT ary aDDiTion of mea T anD eggs The family of the infant girl in Table 1 will also benefit through supplementation of their diets with their shares of poultry meat and eggs. Even when only half of the meat and eggs in Table 1 are provided, they will still have a highly beneficial effect on a child by reducing many of the signs associated with a dietary pro- tein deficiency such as low growth, kwashiorkor and poor mental function. conclusions Poultry meat and eggs are widely available, relatively inexpensive and can be of central importance in helping to meet shortfalls in essential nutrients, particularly of impoverished people. The in- cidence of several common metabolic diseases associated with deficiencies of critical dietary minerals, vitamins and amino acids can be reduced by the contribution of poultry products rich in all essential nutrients except vitamin C. reference cherian, a., seena, s., bullock, r.k. & antony, a.c. 2005.

This has implications for improved nutritional status, particularly of low- income people in developing countries. The technology simply entails increasing the content of some nutrients in hens' diets. Several vitamins (folic acid, B12, vitamin E) can be increased in chicken eggs. Examples of two trace minerals are given in the following. The benefiTs of increasing The ioDine conTenT of The hen's egg About 1 billion people, mainly in developing countries, suffer from iodine deficiency, especially in India, Africa and China, often with serious consequences. Iodine has several functions, especially as a component of two hormones (T4 and T3) in the thyroid gland. As a result of iodine insufficiency, slow brain development in the foe- tus can result in stillbirth or mental retardation in the infant, and in goitre, mainly in adults. Villagers without access to marine food sources and in areas where soils are depleted of iodine are particu- larly at risk. Vegetables and grains grown on iodine-deficient soils lack iodine, and even when they have the minimum level, much can be lost in cooking. Iodized salt is one long-term solution to this problem. It has been introduced into many provinces in China since 1995, but has not yet reached all provinces. A hen's egg normally contains about 53 g iodine/100 g edible portion, which is about 33 percent of the recommended dietary intake (RDI), although this varies. Inexpensive supplementation of a hen's diet with 5 mg of potassium iodide per kilogram of feed does not affect the bird's performance, but increases the iodine content of a 60-g egg from 26 to 88 g; this is more than 50 percent of an adult's RDI (R\u00f6ttger et al., 2008). The benefiTs of increasing The selenium conTenT of The hen's egg The role of selenium, known to be a potent antioxidant, has re- cently received considerable attention (Surai and Dvorska, 2001). Selenium is involved in the proper functioning of the immune system and in reducing or inhibiting the progression of HIV to AIDS. This disease is less prevalent in countries where soil has a high selenium content than in countries with a low soil level (Jaques, 2006). Selenium is also required for sperm motility, and may reduce the risk of miscarriage. The United States Department of Agriculture has allowed the statement, \"selenium may reduce the risk of some forms of cancer\". It is particularly important in reducing the incidence of prostrate cancer. A deficiency of selenium can have an adverse effect on mood states, especially depression, and may be associ- ated with several other health-related problems, including heart disease (Keshan's disease). The conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the biologically active triiodothyronine (T3) also involves selenium. One problem with selenium is that, unlike iodine, there are few specific symptoms of deficiency; consequently an obvious defi- ciency (with few exceptions) has not been recognized, although it may affect general well-being. Selenium in plants depends very much on soil concentrations. Seafoods are a rich source, as are some livestock products, includ-ing eggs and chicken meat. Again, the amount reflects the sele- nium content of the poultry feed. Because humans' daily intake of selenium is relatively low, eggs are an ideal carrier of the trace mineral; there is a maximum amount that can be transferred from feed, but transfer is efficient at low levels of inclusion. Selenium in the inorganic form is less efficient than in the organic form. Sup- plementation of a layer's diet with organic selenium at 0.4 mg/kg of feed will increase the content of 100-g of edible egg from 20 g to about 60 g - the minimum RDI of an adult. conclusions Eggs are an ideal carrier for enriching human diets with some im-portant dietary minerals. The advantages of this approach is that it is unlikely to exceed the minerals' safe upper limits in humans because the amounts sequestered into the eggs are limited, irre- spective of the levels in the hens' diet, and quickly reach a plateau. references Jacques, k.a. 2006.

Linoleic acid (LA), an n-6 fatty acid, is quite common in foods and in most seeds containing vegetable oil, and a LA deficiency is unlikely. Very few plant foods contain the n-3 fats, however, although some oilseeds (rape seed, soybean, walnuts) contain small amounts, while flax seed is rich in alpha-linolenic acid (n-3, ALA), which makes up 22 percent of the oil. Most peo- ple living in developing countries are likely to have insufficient n-3 PUFAs in their diet. The importance of n-3 PUFAs in human health has only recently been recognized. It ranges from protection against some forms of cancer, several specific diseases and conditions (heart disease, brain development, learning ability, and inflammatory diseases such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis) to general well-being (Anonymous, 2002). some n-3 fa Ts are more PoTenT Than oThers To be effective, ALA must first be converted into active forms (eicosapentaenoic acid, [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) in the body. This is done inefficiently or not at all in the elderly and the very young. Human breastmilk contains significant but vari- able amounts of EPA and DHA, which can be increased by provid- ing the mother with an n-3 fatty acid-enriched diet to the benefit of the suckling infant. Infant formula, unless supplemented with these fats (which is uncommon in developing countries), contains few or none of them. The ra Tio of n-6 To n-3 is imPor TanT An important feature of these essential fats is the ratio of n-6 to n-3 in the diet. Ideally, this should be less than 4:1 (as in human milk) but in practice it is usually more than 20:1 and probably much higher in developing countries, especially where there may be no access to seafoods, the major source of EPA and DHA. In the human body, this imbalance results in the rapid conversion of linoleic acid into the active form arachidonic acid (n-6), resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory compounds. High levels of linoleic acid elevate thromboxane, which stimulates platelet aggregation, at-tack. elonga Tion of n-3 fa Ts anD Their enrichmenT in eggs Chickens have the unusual ability of rapidly converting ALA into DHA in significant quantities, and to EPA in lesser amounts. This means that eggs can be enriched with these important fats, pro- vided that there is an adequate supply of ALA in the hens' diet. The diet of hens usually contains some of the n-3 fats, and 100 g of edible egg typically contains 150 mg of total n-3; of this, DHA + EPA is about 20 mg. By adding 10 percent flax seed (2 percent ALA) to the diet of layers, the total n-3 will rise to more than 600 mg/100 g. About one-third of this will be DHA + EPA. Rape seed oil and rape seeds can also be used to enrich eggs with n-3 PU- FAs, but result in lower concentrations. These oil and flax seeds are grown in many developing countries. When included in layer diets, fishmeal, fish waste and fish oil can also increase the n-3 PUFAs in eggs, almost exclusively as EPA and DHA, but if used in too high amounts may cause a fishy taint in the eggs. how much of The n-3 fa Ts Do we neeD? Although there is no agreed recommended dietary intake (RDI) for the n-3 fats, some suggest an intake for adults of 2 to 3 g of total n-3 fats per day, of which DHA + EPA should be 0.6 to 0.8 g. An enriched egg can therefore make a significant contribution to these requirements. Requirements for children are not known, but are likely to be considerably less than those suggested for adults. One difficulty is maintaining the critical n-6 to n-3 bal- ance. This normally means reducing the intake of foods contain- ing significant levels of the most commonly used vegetable oils that contain n-6 PUFAs. conclusions An increasing body of information highlights the importance of the n-3 fats in human health. They are especially important dur - ing pregnancy and early infant development. Seafood, the main source of the important EPA and DHA, is becoming expensive, and its consumption is falling. There is generally a severe dietary deficiency of these n-3 fats in both developing and developed countries worldwide, causing a gross imbalance with the n-6 fats and leading to adverse health consequences. The contribution of enriched eggs will become increasingly important, especially to vegetarians, whose diet has only ALA and little or no EPA and DHA. references anonymous. 2002.

Proceedings International Conference, Shanghai, China, 24-27 April 20028 Poultry DeveloPment review The role of poultry in human nutritionhow important is cholesterol in eggs? David Farrell, School of Land, Crops and Food Sciences, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia 4072, Queensland, Australia During the 1990s there was a drastic decline in egg consumption in the developed world. This was due to concerns about the high cholesterol content of eggs, which stemmed from the perceived effects of cholesterol on coronary heart disease (CHD). In fact blood cholesterol level ranks only about fourth or fifth in the risk factors for CHD. Smoking, excessive bodyweight, lack of exercise, hypertension and stress are other important factors, but publicity about the unproven effects of dietary cholesterol on CHD had a major impact on the sale of cholesterol-rich foods, particularly eggs, even though it has been shown that dietary factors may account for only 25 percent of all causes of elevated blood cho-lesterol (Narahari, 2003). A 60-g egg contains about 200 mg of cholesterol. The standard daily recommended maximum intake of cholesterol is 300 mg. imPor TanT facTs abouT cholesTerol There are two not widely known facts: i) cholesterol must be in the oxidized (rancid) form to cause the arterial plaques that lead to partial blockage of the blood vessels; and ii) some forms of cholesterol are beneficial. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) protects against heart disease by mopping up circulating cholesterol. The culprit is the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in the oxidized form that narrows or \"hardens\" the arteries. One way of counteracting this process is therefore to eat foods rich in natural antioxidants. A third important point is that the fat in eggs is in the unusual form of emulsified oil, almost half of which is made up of healthy monounsaturated fats. This combination probably minimizes the effect of eggs on blood cholesterol. Cholesterol is not a dietary requirement although it is found in almost every cell in the body, particularly in the brain and nervous tissue. The liver produces up to 2 000 mg per day. Only about 50 percent of dietary cholesterol is absorbed, while the rest is excreted. inDiviDuals may resPonD DifferenTly To DieTary cholesTerol Not everyone responds to dietary cholesterol. There are hypo- and hyper-responders (85 and 15 percent of the population respec- tively). In one experiment (Elkin, 2006), men and women were given 21 eggs per person per week, amounting to about 640 mg of cholesterol per day. Plasma LDL did not change in the hypo- responders; in the hyper-responder group it increased by a small but statistically significant amount (10 to 15 mg/dL). Given the unrealistically high consumption of eggs in this study (three per day), it is surprising that the hypo-responder group did not also show an increase in LDL cholesterol. reDucing blooD cholesTerol wiTh Drugs Statins are a group of drugs that inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase from converting HMG-CoA into mevalonate - an early step in the synthesis of cholesterol. Given the very wide functions of cholesterol, this could be thought to be a retrograde step, but apparently it is not. Consequently, statins frequently account for a very large share of drug sales, as they are routinely prescribed even for people with only mildly elevated cholesterol, who then often stay on them for life. can egg cholesTerol be reDuceD? Attempts have been made to lower the cholesterol in eggs (El-kin, 2007) by feeding different grains to layers, which may re- duce egg cholesterol by about 10 percent. Feeding copper at 125 or 250 parts per million (ppm) can reduce cholesterol in eggs by up to 31 percent. Feeding garlic as a paste at up to 8 percent of the diet may reduce egg cholesterol by as much as 24 percent, but there is wide variation. Other natural products have also shown significant but inconsistent responses. Genetic selection for low and high egg cholesterol has met with little success. Although the cholesterol content of the egg is well in excess of that needed for embryo development, reducing egg cholesterol beyond a certain point can decrease hatchability and/or egg production. can we reDuce absorPTion of cholesTerol in fooD? Excess cholesterol is removed from the liver as HDL cholesterol, or largely converted into bile salts, then passed into the ileum, ab- sorbed back into the blood stream and returned to the liver. Some continues to the colon and is excreted as bile acids. Compounds such as insoluble dietary fibre and saponins, found in plants (es- pecially the yucca tree), can bind cholesterol in the small intestine, causing it to be excreted. Fibre also increases the rate of food passage, thereby reducing the opportunity to recycle cholesterol via the lower ileum. how many eggs shoulD we ea T? Nearly half (45 percent) of the public in the United Kingdom still believe that they should be eating a maximum of three eggs a week. A recent article in the British Nutrition Foundation's Nu- trition Bulletin (2009, 34(1): 66-70) reveals that misconceptions about eggs and cholesterol stem largely from incorrect conclu- sions drawn from early research. Many heart and lung health organizations have done a com- plete turn-about and some have even given eggs the \"heart tick\" of approval. Although the recommendation of 300 mg of cho-9 Poultry DeveloPment review The role of poultry in human nutritionlesterol per day as the upper level still stands, there is general consensus that one egg a day will do no harm - not that the cholesterol content of the egg has changed in the meantime. Many nutrition and health advisory bodies may have been in- fluenced by several recent scientific papers, which have dispelled myths around eggs and cholesterol. Australian, Canadian and Irish heart foundations and the British Nutrition Foundation have raised their guideline limits in accordance with recent findings that there is no conclusive evidence to link egg consumption with an increased risk of heart disease. Public PercePTion of eggs is Difficul T To change Concern about a link between cholesterol in eggs and risk factors for heart disease is difficult to dispel. Many people living in devel- oping countries still believe in the dangers of eating eggs, even though they would be the least at risk. Except for the few most affluent people, the staple diet in developing countries is mainly plant-based and contains only small amounts of cholesterol. conclusions Consumption of one egg per day will have no effect on blood cholesterol; recent research suggests that two per day will also have no significant effect for most of the population. The conclu- sion is that eggs are not detrimental to human health and that for those in low- income countries, eggs are very important for good health and well-being, and their consumption should be encouraged. references elkin, r.g. 2006.

Poultry products can also be contaminated with the antimicrobial and anti-parasitic drugs or pesticides used on farms. The ingestion of antimicrobials can cause antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to develop in humans. Campylobacter and Salmonella infections are among the most important food safety hazards. These bacteria account for more than 90 percent of all reported cases of bacteria-related food poisonings worldwide. Most of these cases are related to the consumption of poultry and poultry products, but all domestic livestock are potential reservoirs of infection. Reported cases of Campylobacter and Salmonella infections are believed to repre- sent only a fraction of the true number of cases. Consuming raw or undercooked poultry or poultry products has been implicated as a potential risk factor for human cases of influenza H5N1 infection (HPAI). Poultry meat should be well cooked, with the core temperature reaching 70\u00b0C for at least one second during cooking. Data on food-borne diseases in low-income countries are scarce. There is no precise and consistent global information about the full extent of the occurrence of food poisoning and the costs related to unsafe food. Symptoms are often mild and cases are not reported, but their importance is thought to be substantial. riSK For ConSumerS In many countries, eating habits have undergone major chang-es over the last two decades. The middle class is growing, and this group of people eats more meat and goes out more often for meals. Migration from rural to urban areas has also resulted in changed eating patterns. New food production, preparation and distribution techniques have developed in response to these changes. There is a large increase in \"fast food\" and other ready- to-eat foods, which means that consumers have less control on the selection, preparation and storage of the meat they consume. Children and people in stress situations, such as those facing malnutrition, war or natural disasters, are especially at risk of food-borne bacterial diseases. The main symptom is diarrhoea, and infection can be fatal (with 0.01 percent mortality in infected people in high-income countries). As the causal agent is a bac- terium, these diseases can be treated by antibiotics, but access to treatment is difficult in many low-income countries. Another problem is the development of resistance to antibiotics among zoonotic bacteria. ProDuCtion SyStemS Backyard poultry production is an important activity for many rural households. Consumption of meat and eggs from this production system is considered safe because of the habits usually observed among consumers purchasing or preparing birds from backyard poultry production. Preparation is usually just after slaughter. Be-cause a chicken provides one meal for a family, there are usually no leftovers. The meat is thoroughly cooked, which reduces the risk associated with the consumption of sick birds that is observed in many poor rural areas. If birds are infected, there is risk of hu- man infection with pathogens during the handling of live birds and during preparation. People with little or no experience of poultry farming may in- vest in smallholder intensive poultry production and may build a small broiler or layer chicken house, often near new settlements or suburbs. In these small-scale operations, the use of antibiot- ics - which is sometimes adopted to compensate for poor per - formance resulting from inexperience in management - is not adequate. The risk of consumers ingesting antimicrobials and/or antibiotics is particularly important. In general, poultry meat and egg products from large-scale commercial operations are subject to efficient control processes and are safe. Large companies normally take considerable care to avoid bad publicity resulting from the commercialization of unsafe food products. However, one of the most common prob- lems for large-scale commercially produced poultry meat in low-income countries is the lack of refrigeration during marketing. Table 1 gives an overview of risk factors for food-borne diseases related to the consumption of poultry and poultry products from production systems in low-income countries. reDuCinG riSKS The appearance of clinical signs in infected humans, and the importance of these signs will depend on several factors. On a chilled carcass taken out of the refrigerator, most bacteria need an adaptation time of about two hours before they start to multi- ply. Usually, only high numbers of bacteria will cause disease, and only in more vulnerable people. Consumers can reduce the risk of bacterial food-borne diseases by refrigerating the meat from the moment it is bought until the moment of preparation (heating) 1 With contributions from Philippe Ankers, FAO13 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry and poultry products - risks for human healthcutting the surface of the poultry meat before cooking helps to reduce bacterial contamination. ConSumer ProteCtion The pattern of food-borne disease outbreaks has changed during the last two decades. In the past, most outbreaks were acute and localized, and resulted from a high level of contamination. Now, more outbreaks affect several countries at once, resulting from low-level contamination of widely distributed commercial food products. Risks of the contamination of poultry products by resi- dues and bacteria exist everywhere, owing to the globalization of poultry production and trade. Counteracting this, the relative risk of contaminated poultry products reaching the market has reduced in the last decade, thanks to faster and more reliable diagnostic tools, the establishment of a world epidemiological alert system, and overall improvement of hygiene standards. The availability of efficient antibiotic treatments has also reduced the impact of food-borne diseases. As most food safety hazards related to poultry come from the immediate health risks of ingesting foods contaminated with zoonotic bacteria, regulation and testing efforts have focused on reducing the incidence of this type of contamination. Over re- cent decades, the food chain approach has been recognized as a valuable step forward in ensuring food safety from production to consumption. Such a system can also control contamination with pesticides and veterinary drugs along the production and marketing chains. The many and varied routes of contamination mean that many actors have a role in reducing risk, including feed mill operators, farmers, chicken processors, retailers, supermarkets, restaurants, takeaway establishments, health authorities, legislators, govern- ments and consumers. Flock health, the structure of the poultry food chain (short or chilled), the quality of control procedures during production and supply processes and on the final product - all contribute to the marketing of safe poultry meat and eggs. WHO has set up a Food-borne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG), which harmonizes international efforts for consumption. Temperature and cooking time are critical in minimizing risk. Contaminated parts are less likely to cause food poisoning problems if the meat is well cooked. However, some bacterial toxins are heat-stable, and will not be deactivated. Prop- er attention to minimizing bacterial contamination and prolifera- tion is required from slaughter until cooking. Coagulated blood, blood pudding and chicken-and-duck blood soup can contain harmful pathogens if not well cooked. The World Health Organization (WHO) has elaborated the Five Keys to Safer Food programme (http://www.who.int/foodsafety/ consumer/5keys/en/). Messages for food handlers and consumers have been developed, to decrease the incidence of food-borne diseases. Educational and training tools have also been devel- oped. Education is an important measure for preventing risks to human health from poultry products. Knowledge = prevention! Thoroughly cooking in stew pans is fairly common in develop- ing countries.

China and Brazil, in particular, have emerged as major poul- try meat producers. Meanwhile North American and European producers have lost their global market shares. Over the last 30 years, egg production has also increased enormously in East and Southeast Asia. In 2007, about 45 percent of the eggs consumed worldwide were produced in China (FAO, 2009). international traDe In most countries, poultry production is mainly for domestic consumption. According to FAOSTAT, only about 12 percent of poultry meat and 2 percent of eggs were traded on the world market in 2007. However international trade is increasing. Brazil and the United States are the two largest exporters of poultry meat. Global trade in poultry meat and meat products involving processing is complex.Most of the poultry meat available on the global market comes from large-scale specialized commercial poultry production sys- tems. In low-income countries, imports of cheap low-quality cuts such as wings, lower legs, necks and giblets sold by the piece, make chicken meat more accessible to the average consumer. This coincides with changing eating habits in developed coun- tries, where consumers tend to buy chicken breast and thigh meat and, to a lesser extent, drumsticks. Poultry meat products are usually exported frozen. In many low-income countries, particularly those with tropical climates, trade in frozen food entails risks. It is not uncommon to see defrosted poultry meat displayed for sale on open mar - ket stalls without refrigeration, which presents a risk to human health. The smaller the pieces, the higher the risk of contamina- tion, owing to the increased surface area. Carcasses or cut-up pieces must remain frozen throughout the marketing chain. When the refrigeration chain is interrupted, infectious agents start to multiply on the meat. The consumption of contaminated meat can cause diseases, especially if the meat is not well cooked. 1 With contributions from Philippe Ankers, FAOFigurE 1 Poultry meat and meat product imports and exports 2008, including live birds ('000 tonnes carcass weight equivalent) 433 250 95'# 180 51$5101370 178 13222614450 23 230535 Source: Gira Meat Club.16 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry and poultry products - risks for human healthrisk factors for each poultry product is a first step in risk control, as described in the CODEX. loCal traDe In many low-income countries, local chickens are traditionally sold alive at live poultry markets (also called \"wet markets\"), where slaughtered birds or poultry meat can also be purchased. Live-bird markets are considered critical risk points for the spread of the H5N1 HPAI and other viruses. Authorities may decide to close these markets when there are outbreaks in the area, region or country. In the medium to long term, authorities will encour - age the purchase of poultry meat that has gone through a certifi-cation process. Contact between people, especially children, and live poultry bought at the market should be discouraged. outlooK Global demand for poultry and poultry products will continue to in-crease, owing to global population increase and growing per capi- ta consumption. Trade will also go up, facilitated by improvements in transportation, infrastructure and marketing networks. These factors, and the rapidly changing regulations and rising standards for food safety in high-income countries, create both challenges and opportunities for low- and middle-income countries. For many years, intensive poultry production units in high-in- come countries have approached risk management by focusing first on risk identification and then using Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) procedures. This approach is now adopt- ed by producers in low- and middle-income exporting countries as well. The Codex committees provide advice on the introduc- tion of such procedures. Regulatory agencies worldwide are also increasingly adopting the HACCP procedures as a foundation for new regulations to control microbial pathogens in food. Based on risk assessment, critical control points are identified in the produc- tion chain, and adjustments in the chain will ensure the quality of final products. Governments and the private sector must join forces to im- prove capacity to react quickly to emerging food safety crises, thereby minimizing human illness and financial losses. An increasing number of low- and middle-income countries are exporting poultry and poultry products, and the adoption of in- ternational standards for food safety is essential. Brazil's remarka-Appropriate control of the refrigeration chain is therefore re- quired, from port, to market, to consumer. If other food, such as salad, comes into contact with raw con- taminated poultry meat, it too can be contaminated and will be dangerous to health when eaten raw. Cross-contamination dur - ing food preparation is another important risk factor. In countries where H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is reported, poultry meat can be exported only as pro- cessed products (cooked, pasteurized) to avoid spread of the vi- rus to other countries. In frozen poultry meat products Influenza viruses are not killed by refrigeration or freezing, but human cases of influenza H5N1 infection are mainly the results of direct con- tact with live birds (Swayne and Thomas, 2008). Bacteria, such as Salmonellae, which cause Salmonellosis in people, also survive in frozen products, and can become harmful when they start multiplying after defrosting. Antimicrobial-resist- ant bacteria can also be disseminated through trade of poultry meat products. international FooD SaFety StanDarDS For World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries, the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement defines the basic rules for food safety and animal and plant health standards. It allows countries to set their own standards, but these must be based on science. The Codex Alimentarius is a collection of in- ternational food safety standards that have been adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (the Codex), which was jointly set up by FAO and the World Health Organization (WHO). Under the SPS Agreement, the Codex is the relevant standard-setting organization for food safety. The Codex Alimentarius includes food safety standards related to poultry meat and eggs. Har - monizing application of the CODEX standards among countries is a challenge. Consumers' perceptions of the risk related to food consumption differ among countries, as do the availabil- ity of market information, the importance of risk factors at the farm level, and the standards for food processing and packag- ing technologies. The benefits of applying a specific food safety standard may exceed the costs in some countries, and various food safety risk control measures can achieve similar results.

Poultry export control systems are self-financing. Certification is mandatory in this profitable business. The private sector usu- ally pays for these controls, but government official services and a product board are sometimes involved in carrying them out. Public health and veterinary services must be involved, ideally together, in controlling the entire marketing system within the country, from large-scale integrated operations, down to live-bird markets and small slaughter shops, where they exist. The refrigeration chain for poultry meat is a key factor in food safety, and must be guaranteed by a system in which certificates are required to permit the sale of products. An example of this is the implementation of minimum hygiene criteria for street sellers. In small-scale production systems, only the government can under - take such control, for economic reasons. It requires support from strong legislation and enforcement to prevent false competition. The protection of human health during H5N1 HPAI outbreaks is also a responsibility of government. Government has all the centralized information about the spread of the disease, and can - under certain circumstances - prohibit the operation of live-bird markets and indicate other safe sources of poultry meat.

A study in Guangzhou, China in 2007 to 2008 found that 15 percent of poultry workers in live poultry markets, where the birds are also slaughtered, had antibodies against HPAI. This compares with only 1 percent in the general population (Wang, Fu and Zheng, 2009). However, there are also risks of human exposure to pathogens originating from the poultry slaughtering, processing, storage, handling and preparation phases. Poultry can be contaminated with harmful infectious agents, and raw poultry products are re- ported to be responsible for a significant number of cases of hu- man food poisoning. During these phases, controlling the contamination of carcass- es by such pathogens presents a considerable challenge, espe- cially in small-scale operations. In tropical countries, the ambient temperature is usually above 20\u00b0C, with a high degree of humid- ity creating favourable conditions for the multiplication of most bacteria. During the hot season, increased numbers of bacteria are found on poultry carcasses. To quantify the food safety risks along the production and marketing chain, it is important to know how, where and when contamination with microorganisms occurs. Once this is known, it is possible to introduce risk reduction measures. The adoption of improved technology and strict hygiene measures can often reduce the risk of contamination of carcasses. The slaughtering facility must be divided into at least three separate sections: a live birds' area; a slaughtering area, including defeathering; and a processing area, starting with evisceration. To reduce the risk of pathogens multiplying on carcasses, poultry meat and carcasses should be refrigerated or consumed immediately after slaughter. The native microflora of processed poultry is composed of many types of bacteria and yeasts, most of which are part of the microflora of live poultry. This microflora is carried into the pro- cessing facility on the body and in the intestines of the birds. For example, the bacteria Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. inhabit the intestines of healthy birds, and can cause disease in humans, depending on their pathogenicity and the number and concentration of bacteria on the product. The sum of these fac- tors will determine whether the consumer is at risk at the time of consumption. The cleaner the birds are when they arrive at the slaughter place, the fewer the bacteria on their carcasses during slaughter -ing. On many farms, it is difficult to achieve low bacterial counts on the skin and feathers of birds, so emphasis should be placed on hygiene at the slaughter line. larGe-SCale CommerCial SlauGhterhouSeS In modern large-scale slaughter plants, appropriate equipment is used and there are strict procedures for minimizing contamina- tion. Nearly all procedures are automatic, and birds' contact with surfaces or poultry workers is kept to a minimum; for example, the carcasses are scalded in a counter-flow system, with the water flowing from clean to dirty, in the opposite direction to the birds. Automation enables the efficient control of hygiene, residues, etc. Although control systems are expensive, the large scale of operations means that this expense will have only a marginal ef- fect on the prices of final products. These technical solutions and controls ensure delivery of a very safe product. If the processed carcasses are kept refrigerated and delivered rapidly to the su- permarket, and kept there under appropriate temperatures, the consumer can be assured of buying a safe poultry product. Small-SCale SlauGhterinG F aCilitieS In small-scale slaughtering facilities, birds are killed and then scalded in hot water. The carcasses are then plucked and evis- cerated, mostly by hand. Before and after evisceration, carcasses are often washed, which may contribute to the dissemination of bacteria on and among carcasses. Further down the marketing chain, trussed birds are often displayed on shelves at ambient temperatures until they are sold. Unsold birds may be put into a refrigerator overnight. When ambient temperatures are moderate to high (above 20\u00b0C) the microorganisms will multiply quickly, resulting in rapid deterioration of the meat's quality and safety, if the products are not cold-stored. Traditional slaughtering during the hot season has been found to result in a significantly increased incidence of bacterial flora on poultry carcasses (Cohen et al., 2007). When carcasses are prop- erly cooled (at 4 to 10\u00b0C), the growth of pathogens slows down. reDuCinG Contamination oF Poultry CarCaSSeS in Small-SCale SlauGhterinG FaCilitieS Birds to be slaughtered should be clean and dry; the cleaner they are the less contaminated their carcasses and meat will be (Bold- er, 2007). To avoid the soiling of feathers with faeces, crates for 1 With contributions from Philippe Ankers, FAO19 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry and poultry products - risks for human healthprocess is also reduced, and hygiene is improved. Blood, which can contain pathogens, is collected in the trough beneath the cone and will not be splashed. Commercial poultry processing plants defeather carcasses me- chanically, after the feathers have been loosened by scalding (Ar - nold, 2007). Scalding involves immersing the carcasses in hot water (for four minutes at 50 to 58\u00b0C, or by dipping several times in water at 65\u00b0C), to loosen the feathers from the skin. In small- scale operations, this scalding is often done in a cooking pan. An under-scalded carcass will be difficult to pluck, while an over-scalded one will show torn skin or cooked flesh. Harmful bacteria and viruses can survive the scalding process. In some cultures, birds are scalded in boiling water. This reduces the risk of spread- ing viruses, but may cook the flesh. The quality and temperature of the scalding water are critical in determining the final degree of carcass contamination. The water should be frequently replaced. Cross-contamination among carcasses is an important prob- lem during the defeathering process. Mechanical defeathering equipment work centrifugally; the carcasses are rotated and the feathers are rubbed off by rubber fingers. Carcass contamination can occur through: direct contact between contaminated and uncontaminated carcasses; compression of the carcass, resulting in expulsion of internal faeces to the carcass surface; the mechanical fingers; contaminated feathers remaining in the plucker. At evisceration, the vent is opened, the internal organs are re- moved, and the gizzard, liver and heart may be harvested. Car - casses can be contaminated through spillage of the contents of the intestines.transporting poultry should not be stacked on top of each other, unless there are solid partitions between them. The people slaughtering the birds should take precautions, by washing their hands frequently and avoiding the splashing of blood on to their face and clothes. Placing the birds into cones for slaughter prevents the spread of microorganisms, because it prevents the birds from flapping during bleeding.

Chilling?Handling live birds20 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry and poultry products - risks for human healthThe contamination of carcasses and meat with poultry bacte- ria is not the only health risk to humans; the bacteria carried by poultry workers can also be transferred to the carcasses and sub- sequently to consumers. Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium of particular concern here. Where evisceration is done by hand, as in traditional slaughter places, there is a potentially serious risk of contamination with these bacteria. Infrequent hand-washing exacerbates the problem. The primary factor contributing to staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks is inadequate control of temperature after slaughter, with the initial contamination of-ten being traced to poor personal hygiene by food handlers. If slaughter is followed by storage at temperatures that permit bac- terial growth and multiplication, toxins will be produced. Staphy- lococcal toxins are noted for their heat resistance, and typically they cannot be inactivated by the normal heat processing of food (Cohen et al., 2007). This means that once the toxins are present in the uncooked meat, people will get sick even from thoroughly cooked food. Where carcasses are rinsed (with a shower or spray), the wa- ter used should be of drinking quality. Washing with cold wa-ter reduces the quantity of microorganisms on the carcass in the slaughter process. For good hygiene, and to wash away all the dirt and bacteria, etc., a regular supply of clean water is essential. Water should also always be available for personal hygiene and the cleaning of knives and other utensils. Water quantity and quality determine the level of hygiene. Cross-contamination of carcasses can occur on working tables, sinks or draining boards during processing. The best way of pre-venting contamination of clean carcasses is to hang the birds. Abattoir workers handling the carcasses and contaminated knives can also act as vectors for the cross-contamination of carcasses.

Feathers for trade are pasteurized, which kills most viruses, including H5N1 HPAI virus, and leaves the product safe (Beato, Capua and Alexander, 2009). Poultry slaughter waste, such as carcasses, blood, feathers and offal, should be properly disposed of. It can contain viruses, bacteria and residues. In resource-poor areas, burning or burial are the most likely, practical and effective methods for disposing of waste (Nicholson, Groves and Chambers, 2005).

Newly hatched birds have a poor ability to control body temperature, and require some form of supplemen- tary heating, particularly in the first few days after hatch. Many developing countries are located in tropical areas where minimal heating is required. Indeed, the emphasis in these countries - par - ticularly for meat chickens - is on keeping the birds cool. Production systems International poultry breeding and feed companies operate in many developing countries and have established large-scale com- mercial farms in a significant number of them. The housing and equipment used make it possible to exert considerable control over the climate provided to the birds, but such houses are expen- sive to build and operate, and require a large turnover of birds to make them viable. Owing to the lower construction and running costs, medium- and small-scale commercial housing is popular in developing countries. By far the most prevalent poultry farming system in many developing countries is the small-scale scavenging system, which usually involves only very basic (if any) shelter for housing birds. Large-scale commercial farms: Commercial houses in developing countries are clear-span structures with litter on the floor for meat birds or cages for laying hens. The commercial chicken meat in- dustry in some developing countries is vertically integrated, with single companies owning feed mills, breeder farms, hatcheries and processing plants. Arrangements typically involve agree-ments in which the farmer or landowner provides the housing, equipment and labour, while the company provides the chicks, feed, medication, transport and supervision. For controlled-environment housing of layers, multi-tier cage systems are common. Most large-scale commercial farms use controlled-environment systems to provide the ideal thermal envi- ronment for the birds (Glatz and Bolla, 2004). Birds' performance in controlled-environment sheds is generally superior to that in naturally ventilated houses, as the conditions can be maintained in the birds' thermal comfort zone. Achieving the ideal environ- ment for birds depends on appropriate management of the poul- try house. Modern houses are fully automated, with fans linked to sen- sors to maintain the required environment. Some commercial op- erators use computerized systems for the remote checking and changing of settings in houses. Forced-air furnaces and radiant heating are the main methods of providing heat to young chicks.Medium-scale commercial: In developing countries, most medi-um-scale commercial layer and chicken meat houses rely on natu- ral airflow though the shed for ventilation (Daghir, 2001). Where required, meat birds and layers are given radiant heating early in their lives, to maintain body temperature. Laying hens may be kept in commercial wire cages in open sheds, or in sheds with wire sides to exclude wild birds, scavenging poultry and predators. Small-scale commercial (improved genotype stock and supple- mentary feeding): Houses of various shapes and dimensions are typically constructed using local building materials consisting of timber or mud bricks and bamboo. These small-scale commercial facilities may have several rooms or compartments where chicks are brooded, pullets are reared and layers are housed in a floor- based system or in cages. Meat birds are often kept in single-age groups of 50 to 100 chickens within the house. The house can Photo Credit: I. AiniSector 4 Credit: Karma Nidup 25 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry housing and management in developing countriesbe used as night shelter for birds that forage under free-range conditions or that are confined to an outdoor pen during the day. Small-scale semi-scavenging system using indigenous birds: When provided, shelters are made from various materials, includ- ing wood and leaf material from local trees or shrubs. Birds in the household flock are typically housed overnight in the shelter, and are let out in the morning to forage during the day (Ahlers et al., Sector 2 medium-scale layer and broiler operationsPhoto Credit: Olaf Thieme Photo Credit: I. Aini 2009). If no special structure is provided, the birds sometimes shelter overnight under the farmer's house or even inside the house with the family. Where provided, the usually rudimentary house comprises posts, a thatch or scrap iron roof, and thatch or scrap wire netting walls. Feeders, perches, drinkers and nest boxes made from local materials are sometimes provided, and special shelters of a wide variety of designs and constructions are sometimes used to house broody hens with their chicks. 26 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry housing and management in developing countriesFogging systems: Fogging systems are sometimes used to reduce the shed temperature. Fogging works best in dry climates, and usually involves several rows of high-pressure nozzles that release a fine mist throughout the house. The cooling effect is signifi- cantly increased by airflow from the use of fans within the shed. Natural ventilation is common in medium- and small-scale op- erations and in areas where the climatic conditions are similar to the temperatures required by birds. Ventilation is usually provided by prevailing breezes. Natural ventilation works best in poultry sheds where the long axis runs east to west, to avoid heating of the sidewalls by the sun during the morning and afternoon. Poultry management The aim of management is to provide the conditions that en-sure optimum performance of the birds (Bell and Weaver, 2001). Given reasonable conditions, broody hens are very successful at hatching their chicks, but good hatchability using artificial incuba- tion (both large and small) relies on careful management of tem- perature, humidity, ventilation, position and egg turning. During incubation, the egg loses water vapour through its shell. The rate of water loss depends on both the shell structure and the humid- ity of the air surrounding the egg. The quality of the hatch also depends on the age and health of the breeder flock, and on the evenness and cleanliness of the eggs set. Factors involved in poultry management Poultry management involves monitoring poultry health; ensur - ing that the poultry house is maintained with appropriate brood- ing, rearing, growing and laying conditions; and ensuring that recommended vaccinations are given and appropriate feeding programmes are used. In developing countries, it is often difficult to achieve optimum performance from birds, owing to less-than- optimal housing conditions and lack of quality feed, vaccines and trained staff. Breed effects Owing to their superior production, commercial hybrids of high genetic merit are often used in developing countries, but are not well-suited to tropical environments (see website on Poultry ge- netics and breeding in developing countries). These birds are sen- sitive to changes in the diet and to high ambient temperature, and require skilled stockpersons to manage them. Indigenous poultry can cope better with the harsh conditions often prevail- ing in developing countries, and good management will improve their performance. This can be achieved by using good housing, protecting the birds from predators, and providing them with the environmental conditions that allow them to achieve maximum profitability. temperature effects Farmers need to compensate for undesirable climatic conditions by manipulating control systems or modifying the house to en- sure that the welfare and environmental needs of the birds are satisfied. Environmental extremes (heat and cold stress, excessive or inadequate ventilation, poor air quality) can be managed if the design of the poultry house is appropriate for the conditions. Birds require adequate space, sufficient feed to meet their nu- tritional requirements, and an adequate supply of good-quality Tunnel-ventilated broiler house: exterior and interior views Photo Credit: Robert Pym Photo Credit: Robert Pymventilation management All poultry houses need some form of ventilation to ensure an adequate supply of oxygen, while removing carbon dioxide, other waste gases and dust. In commercial operations, minimum ven- tilation is often practised in colder climates, but not generally in tropical ones (Glatz and Bolla, 2004). In large-scale automated operations, correct air distribution can be achieved using a negative pressure ventilation system. When chicks are very young, or in colder climates, the air from the inlets should be directed towards the roof, to mix with the warm air there and circulate throughout the shed. With older birds and in warmer temperatures, the incoming air is directed down towards the birds, and helps to keep them cool. Evaporative cooling pads can be placed in the air inlets to keep birds cool in hot weather. Tunnel ventilation is the most effective ventilation system for large houses in hot weather. Tunnel ventilation: These systems are popular in hot climates. Ex- haust fans are placed at one end of the house or in the middle of the shed, and air is drawn through the length of the house, removing heat, moisture and dust. Evaporative cooling pads are located at the air inlets. The energy released during evapora- tion reduces the air temperature, and the resulting airflow cre- ates a cooling effect, which can reduce the shed temperature by 10 \u00b0C or more, depending on humidity. Maximum evaporation is achieved when water pumps are set to provide enough pad mois- ture to ensure optimum water evaporation. If too much water is added to the pads, it is likely to lead to higher relative humidity and temperatures in the shed.27 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry housing and management in developing countrieswater. Use of a stringent quarantine programme to prevent dis- ease is an essential element of good management, and farmers must be able to recognize disease and treat it as soon as possible. A suitable vaccination and medication programme is essential in commercial operations. effects of nutrition Managers need to ensure that the diets provided to birds in com- mercial operations meet the nutrient requirements of each age group and strain of chickens (see website on Poultry feed avail-ability and nutrition in developing countries). Smallholder systems in developing countries typically place less emphasis on achieving maximum production, and more on maximizing profitability by using diets comprised mainly of local feedstuff ingredients, rather than imported feeds. Key management practices by farmers who mix their own feed include ensuring that micro-ingredients are kept cool, mouldy ingredients are not used, and storage facilities are weather- and rodent-proof. importance of good hygiene An essential management task is to maintain clean sheds, sur - roundings and equipment. A clean shed improves health and lim-its parasites, dust and microbial contamination, while clean shed surroundings reduce vermin and fly loads. This is important not only for litter and manure management but also for biosecurity. Removal of residual feed from feeders is an important practice critical to the health of the flock. Another important manage- ment task is to sanitize sheds to minimize the risk of disease to incoming flocks of birds. Maintaining high flock health status is essential, and routine vaccination programmes for a number of diseases are typically in place, particularly in larger-scale opera- tions. Some vaccinations are carried out at the hatchery, but it is essential that a proper vaccination schedule be established and that vaccination protocols be complied with. litter materials and management Broiler litter is the material used as bedding in poultry houses to absorb faecal waste from birds and to make the floor of the house easy to manage. Common litter materials are wood shav- ings, chopped straw, sawdust, shredded paper and rice hulls, and a wide range of other materials are used in different regions around the world. Litter should be light, friable, non-compressi- ble, absorbent, quick to dry, of low thermal conductivity and - very important - cheap. After use, the litter comprises poultry manure, the original litter material, feathers and spilled feed. The litter quality in a shed is determined by the type of diet, the tem-perature and the humidity. The recommended depth for litter is between 10 and 20 cm. Sawdust can result in high dust levels and respiratory problems. Dust particles in the litter capable of caus- ing health problems in the birds are derived from dried faeces, feathers, skin and litter; their adverse effects arise because they carry or incorporate bacteria, fungi and gases. management of lighting Poultry have seasonal and daily biological rhythms, both of which are mediated by light, particularly day length. For day length to exert its controlling effect, there needs to be a dark phase (night) when light levels should be less than 0.5 lux. Day length and light intensity during the breeder bird's life have an important role in development of the reproductive system. The difference in day lengths and light intensities between the rearing and the laying phases is the principal factor responsible for controlling and stimulating ovarian and testicular development (Lewis and Morris, 2006). The response to increases in day length and light- ing intensity depends on the body weight profile during rearing, which in turn depend on the nutritional regime. The effects of light are predominantly on the rate of sexual maturation and egg production. The two types of artificial lighting commonly provided are in- candescent and fluorescent. Incandescent globes are cheaper to install, but have lower light efficiency and a shorter life. Fluores- cent lights are three to four times as efficient and last about ten times as long, but have variable performance in cold weather. The colour of the light rays has an effect on chickens' productivity. For example, green and blue lights improve growth, and lower age at sexual maturity, while red, orange and yellow lights increase age at sexual maturity, and red and orange lights stimulate egg pro-duction. Birds are calmer in blue light, so blue lights are recom- mended for use during depopulation in commercial operations. Lighting programmes for broilers: Lighting programmes for com- mercial broiler operations vary widely from company to company, and depend on the strain of bird used, the housing type (naturally ventilated versus controlled-environment), the geographical loca- tion and the season. Where light can be excluded from sheds, birds are typically reared under low-intensity (5 to 10 lux) lighting, to keep them calm and to prevent feather pecking. During early brooding, 25 lux is used to stimulate feeding. Lighting programmes for layers and breeders: Light is critical for the onset and maintenance of egg production. Increasing day length (from winter to summer) during the rearing period stimu- lates the onset of sexual maturity, whereas shortening day length (from summer to winter) has the opposite effect. Early onset of lay may not be beneficial as it may predispose to reproductive problems. Where artificial lighting is possible, a constant day length (of between 12 to 16 hours per day) during the rearing period has been shown to result in a delayed onset of lay, and is the preferred rearing treatment. Shortening day length or too little light will discourage egg production, and must be avoided once the birds are in lay. stockpersonship Farmers and their staff play a critical role in looking after the birds and maximizing productivity. They need to empathize with and care about their birds, and to avoid exposing them to adverse situations that may cause stress (see website on Poultry welfare in developing countries). The people responsible for the care of poultry should be well trained, experienced and dedicated. The first task for poultry staff is to learn how to carry out routine checks on the birds, so they can identify what is normal in the flock and what the signs of trouble are. Good stock attendants minimize the risks to their animals' health and welfare. By doing this, they allow production to reach its potential, while treating the animals with care (Barnett and Glatz, 2004). This is sometimes called \"stockpersonship\". Staff should be able to identify quickly 28 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry housing and management in developing countriesany changes in the flock and in the birds' environment, and any physical, chemical or microbiological threats, such as damaged equipment, mouldy feed or infectious disease, and should pre- vent problems from escalating. The more sophisticated the poul- try farming system, the greater the management skills required. records Record keeping and meeting production targets are good man- agement practices that allow the identification and solution of problems. When a problem is identified, the next step is to at- tempt to fix it. Identifying the cause of and fixing a problem is an important part of the farmer's knowledge base, and is likely to assist in preventing a recurrence of the problem (Barnett et al., 2001). Records kept over time can help identify some of the pos- sible causes of problems. One of the most useful record-keeping documents is a diary, which can be used in combination with record-keeping sheets to record major activities, problems identi-fied, equipment repairs, deviations from equipment settings, and any staff issues. Records of production, growth, feed, egg weights, mortalities, treatments given, and response to treatments should be main- tained to assist investigations of sub-optimal performance. In all production systems, signs of ill health can be detected when poultry reduce their food and water intake; reduce production or growth; undergo a change in appearance, behaviour or activity level; or have abnormal feather condition or droppings. reFerenCes ahlers, alders, r., wegener, P ., w ethli, e. & young, m. 2009.

On semi-commercial and commercial farms, they are hatched artificially in incubators. hatching fertile eggs using broody hens One of the important characteristics of village hens is their ca-pacity for broodiness. The large majority of improved-breed birds have lost this capacity. When broody birds are approached, they make a typical brooding noise and fluff up their feathers. Broody hens prefer to sit on eggs in a dark environment that is protected from predators, and they need a supply of feed and water. When one or more cockerels are present in the flock and have been observed mating regularly with females for a week or more, the eggs will normally be fertile (CTA, 2007). Quality of fertile eggs Hatching eggs (stored at 16 to 17 0C) need to have good shell quality. Storing eggs at higher temperatures promotes the devel-opment of the embryo. In many developing countries it is difficult for village farmers or breeding centres to store eggs under ideal conditions. Under high temperature conditions, the eggs are like- ly to \"sweat\", allowing bacteria to penetrate the shell. Relative humidity should be maintained at approximately 75 percent in the fertile egg holding room. Higher humidity encourages mould growth on eggs. Pre-warming of fertile eggs Eggs need to be warmed to room temperature for approximately eight to 12 hours before they are set in the incubator. The pur - pose of pre-warming is to minimize temperature shock to the embryo and condensation on the shell. It also reduces the vari- ation in hatch time. Good air circulation is essential for an even pre-warming of eggs. the incubator room Optimum results can be expected if the temperature in the incu-bator room is maintained at about 25 0C. However, the tropical climate in many developing countries makes it difficult to main- tain good incubator room conditions. incubators In small hatcheries in developing countries, incubators are often small, still-air machines with a capacity of 12 to 240 eggs. The relative humidity must be 55 to 60 percent at set, and increased to 75 percent after day 18. In small incubators, this is normally achieved by placing an extra container of water in the incubator. The eggs are set in a horizontal position and are turned manually. The source of heat is usually a thermostatically controlled heating element or light bulb or kerosene lamp. Humidity is supplied by water in a container either above or below the eggs, and venti- lation is controlled by small air vents. Circulating-air incubators have an electrically driven fan to maintain constant temperature and ventilation of the eggs. In large-scale operations in developing countries, incubator set- ting capacity ranges from approximately 10 000 to 100 000 eggs. The equipment used to incubate and hatch chicks is all precisely controlled (Cobb-Vantress, 2008). Optimum temperatures for set- ters are 37.1 to 38.6 \u00b0C, at a relative humidity of 60 to 70 percent. The hatching eggs are set vertically, with the blunt end uppermost in the setter, and are turned mechanically through 90\u00b0 every hour Hatching by a broody hen Kerosene operated Robert Pym 30 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry housing and management in developing countriesuntil about three days prior to hatching. The eggs are then trans- ferred to a hatcher, where they are placed on hatching trays on their sides, with the long axis horizontal, to allow the chick to move freely out of the shell at hatching. Hatcher temperatures are usually slightly lower than those in the setter, to reduce the risk of overheating, and are typically 37 to 38 \u00b0C, while relative humidity is usually raised to about 75 to 80 percent. Hatchability should be in the range of 80 to 90 percent for imported hybrid strains, but varies with the breed and the age of the breeder flock. egg candling Candling of chicken eggs on the seventh and eighteenth days of incubation is recommended for small poultry producers and commercial farms. Egg candling (using a torch or bright light in a dark area) detects cracked and infertile eggs and those containing dead embryos or bacterial or fungal rots; these eggs can then be removed from the incubator. Cracked and rotten eggs must not be allowed to remain in the incubator as they can explode and result in infection of the hatching chicks. Fumigation of incubators The effectiveness of formaldehyde gas in killing bacterial organ-isms is based on the concentration of the gas, the exposure time, the temperature and the humidity of the incubator. The chemi- cals potassium permanganate and formalin are mixed together to release formaldehyde gas. This procedure has proved to be the most effective method of destroying bacterial organisms in the hatchery. hatCheD ChiCks The chicks hatch after 21 days of brooding or incubation. If the eggs have been hatched by a hen, she will immediately take care of the chicks, but will typically remain on the nest until the major - ity of the eggs have hatched. If the chicks have been hatched in an incubator, they are ready to be taken out of the hatcher when most of them are dry and fluffed up. Chicks will easily dehydrate if left in the hatcher for too long. They have yolk reserves for about three days, but survival rates are increased if they are pro- vided with food and water within 24 hours of hatching. Chicks are normally removed from the hatchers within 24 hours of the first chick hatching. The chicks should be held in an environment that prevents overheating or chilling. Temperatures should be in the range of 30 to 32 \u00b0C, and relative humidity in the range of 70 to 75 percent. Adequate ventilation is vital at all times, to provide the chicks with a constant and uniform supply of fresh air. vent and feather sexing Sexing of day-old chickens is not normally practised on village farms, but is an essential procedure in commercial operations with modern hybrids, particularly for layers, where the male chick has no commercial value. Broilers are also often sexed, but the requirement here is less important. There are two fundamentally different approaches to sexing: one identifies the sex of the day- old chick by sex organ-related differences; and the other employs sex-linked genes (Barnett et al., 2001). In the first approach, sex- ing can be done in any population using one of two methods: i) vent sexing, which relies on visual identification of the sex organs using an endoscope inserted into the chick's vent; and ii) cloa- Large-scale commercial incubator and hatcher Day-old chicks in 100-bird chick boxes following hatch Photo Credit: Robert Pym 31 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry housing and management in developing countriescal sexing, where the chick's cloaca is everted and the vestigial copulatory organ can be seen in male chicks. Both of these pro- cedures require extensive training. The second approach involves fixing appropriate sex-linked feathering rate or colour genes in the parental lines (see website on Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countries). In the progeny from such matings, male chicks are either slow-feathering or white, and hatchery staff can readily distinguish them at hatch from their rapid-feathering or coloured-feathered female counterparts. Culling chicks in the hatchery Culling is conducted to reduce the potential for transferring dis- ease within flocks, to provide a uniform hatch of chicks for pro- duction, and to reduce pain and suffering of sick and deformed chicks. There are three methods for culling surplus or sick chicks (Bar - nett et al., 2001): Cervical dislocation: The neck of the day-old chick is held against a firm surface (e.g., the edge of a tabletop) and gen- tle pressure from both thumbs is applied to dislocate it. This method can be used on small farms. Gas stunning with carbon dioxide: The chicks are held in a con- tainer covered with a lid or plastic. They are initially stunned and then killed with longer exposure. A concentration of 55 percent carbon dioxide in air is required to kill the chicks with two minutes exposure time. High-speed macerators: Some larger hatcheries use these to kill unwanted chicks and any live chicks in eggs that have failed to hatch. removal of claws and spurs In commercial operations, it is routine for male breeding birds to have the terminal segment of the inner toe removed, to prevent damage to female birds while mating. This is routinely done at the hatchery, although about 10 percent of chicks may have their claws removed on-farm. It is best to use a beak trimming machine to cut and cauterize the wound, although scissors can also be used. Males may also have their spurs removed, again preferably using a beak trimmer to cut and cauterize the wound (Barnett et al., 2001). Sharp scissors can be used, but the wound is not cau- terized, and there is a risk of excessive bleeding. This procedure is necessary to prevent damage to birds when fighting. In village farms, the sharp points of the claws and spurs can be blunted with abrasive material. Bird identification A small percentage of breeding birds require individual identifi- cation. Methods used for small numbers of birds include either cutting the skin between the toes (the webbing) with scissors or a scalpel blade, or trimming the digits with sharp scissors or a beak trimming blade (Barnett et al., 2001). For larger numbers of birds number-embossed wing bands or leg bands are necessary. Wing bands are attached to the bird by passing the pin or sharp point through the web of the wing. Leg bands are fastened around the metatarsus above the foot. Wing-bands can be applied at hatch, but leg-bands can not be applied before about 12 weeks of age, due to rapid increase in the diameter of the leg up until about this age. reFerenCes Barnett, J.l., glatz, P .C., almond, a., hemsworth, P .h. & Parkinson, g.B. 2001.

Although newly hatched chicks can survive on their own body reserves for up to 72 hours, depending on environmental condi- tions, their survival is increased if they are provided with food and water within 24 hours of hatching. The sooner they are pro- vided with these and a warm area, the higher the rate of survival. Chicks must not be chilled or overheated at any time. BrooDing systems Broody hens Under natural conditions, the mother hen keeps the chicks warm by allowing them to nestle under her feathers. The chicks follow the broody hen around and learn to forage and drink by watching her behaviour. In small village poultry settings, hens can care for up to 15 chicks. Ideally, chicks should be provided with a com- mercial ration (Ahlers et al., 2009) or other feed for at least the first two weeks, to improve the survival rate. spot brooding For small flocks of up to 20 chicks, a small enclosure in the poultry house or a confined area can be set up. This can be made from cardboard or timber, with a heat lamp suspended over the enclo- sure to keep the chicks warm. When the chicks are provided with an ideal temperature, they spread uniformly over the enclosure. When chicks feel cold, they crowd under the heat source. If the pen is too warm, the chicks move away from the heat and pant with their wings spread out (Bell and Weaver, 2001). For larger flocks of up to 400 chicks, circular enclosures are set up in the poultry house to retain them. These areas are usually made from Masonite or sheet metal, with a gas brooder suspend- ed over them to provide the required temperature (about 35 \u00b0C immediately under the brooder). There should be sufficient space for chicks to move away from the heat source. Temperatures in the outer part of the enclosure may be as low as 20 \u00b0C. Commercial layers are often raised in growing cages (of up to 20 chicks/cage) with warm-room brooding, or with a heat source over each cage in tropical climates. As the birds age, the stocking density is reduced by moving chicks to other growing cages. whole-house brooding In large commercial operations, the whole shed is maintained at a temperature of 30 to 32 \u00b0C both day and night, using forced- air heaters. This can be achieved only if the shed is completely sealed. As most developing countries are located in the tropics, there is usually no need for whole-house brooding. When this system is used, the house temperature is lowered by about 2 to 3 \u00b0C per week until it reaches ambient temperature, provided this is not below 18 \u00b0C. Chick feeders At one day old, feed for the chicks can be scattered on paper. After three to four days, the paper can be removed, and chicks provided with feed in shallow feeders on the floor or cages. Chick drinkers For village chicks, drinkers can comprise bamboo sections or wa- ter bottles. These should be cleaned and refilled daily.

Typically, a village flock comprises ten to 12 layers with one or two cockerels. Natural incubation by broody hens is common, and egg fertility ranges from good to poor, depending on several factors. The decision to construct a house for chickens is often de- termined by the individual farmer's access to materials, the avail-ability of space within the village, and other social and economic factors. However, the houses built are basically for night shelter, and the breeding birds are left to scavenge for feed during the day, thus they remain prone to predators even though shelters are provided. In commercial and semi-commercial settings in developing countries, breeders are normally housed in naturally ventilated houses, with some additional lighting provided if electricity is available. The house is usually fitted with nest boxes, feeders and drinkers. Some large-scale operations use automatic feeding and egg collection systems. BreeDers in DeveloPing Countries A number of government, non-governmental and training or - ganizations have developed poultry breeding programmes for producing local chickens in developing countries. Some centres have imported improved commercial strains for crossing with the local chickens to improve the meat and egg production of small- holder poultry flocks. The breeding centres often distribute chicks to farmers for use in their village farm operations. Larger com- mercial integrated poultry franchises in developing countries nor - mally import fertile eggs from commercial layer or broiler breeder flocks. These eggs are set in large hatcheries, and hatched chicks are either sold in small lots to village farmers or used in commer - cial or semi-commercial operations to produce chicken meat and eggs for consumers in towns and cities. The poultry breeding facilities established in developing coun- tries are normally small-scale. Ideally, the breeding flock should comprise females with good egg production, which are mated with active cockerels. A major issue is maintaining a supply of fertile eggs. Young breeder flocks produce fewer fertile eggs than those at peak of lay, and fertility also tends to be lower in eggs produced by older breeders. Hatchability and the uniformity of hatched chicks depend on management of the eggs produced by the breeders. In larger-scale operations, eggs should be collected at least four times a day, handled carefully to prevent breakages, and stored for no longer than seven days in a cool room at 15.5 to 17 \u00b0C and relative humidity of 75 percent. Eggs on the floor or that are dirty should not be set. In small-scale village operations, farmers can clean dirty eggs with abrasive paper and make use of all the eggs that are available. BreeDer ChiCk management Chicks that are reared for use in a breeding programme should be kept separate from other birds in other age groups. Cock- erels should also be grown separately from females, preferably until five months of age. Generally, however, this approach is not possible in village operations. Most chick rearing in hot-climate developing countries is carried out in naturally ventilated houses. In commercial operations, chicks scratch in the litter, creating un-even litter levels, particularly around feeders and drinkers. Small Photo Credit: Robert Pym Photo Credit: Viengsavanh Phimphachanhvongsod35 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry housing and management in developing countrieslighting Programme management The onset of lay in layer and broiler breeder hens is critically linked to change in day length: increasing day length stimulates the on- set of sexual maturity, while decreasing it has the opposite effect. In developing tropical countries, natural day-light rearing of breed- ing stock is generally used, and works well, because the variation in natural day length is small. During the rearing period, birds can remain in natural light in all seasons until artificial light stimulus is given, normally at 20 or 21 weeks of age in meat breeders and from 18 weeks in layer breeders. When extending the day length, artificial light is provided at both the beginning and the end of the natural day-light period (Lewis and Morris, 2006). water management Breeding birds in village systems are normally provided with wa-ter in open containers. Most commercial operations provide one bell drinker per 80 birds, while nipple drinkers, which are a more hygienic water delivery system, are provided for eight to ten birds per nipple. Chickens normally drink between 1.6 and 2.0 times their daily feed intake at 21 \u00b0C, in both ad libitum and control fed flocks. At ambient temperatures higher than 30 \u00b0C, water consumption increases to more than twice the feed intake. High water consumption may indicate errors in feed formulation or leaking drinker systems. reloCating BirDs In village farming systems, breeder birds are often sold and trans-ferred to other village farms. In semi-commercial and commercial operations, the age for transferring stock to other farms is deter - mined mainly by the facilities available, the birds' body weight and the lighting programme. Transfer can be very stressful for the birds, and every effort should be made to ensure that it is car - ried out smoothly. It is best to transfer males a week earlier than females, so they can adjust to their feeding system. The ratio of males to females is usually kept at about 1:10, and males should be healthy with no obvious skeletal defects. ProDuCtion PerioD In most developing countries, manual nesting systems that allow about four birds per nest are used. Young breeder males are of- ten added to an older flock to overcome the decline in fertility that usually occurs after peak egg production. Older males usu- ally undergo a decline in mating activity and a reduction in sperm quality. egg weights There are considerable advantages in weighing a sample of eggs to establish the trend in egg weight. Analysis of this trend pro- vides a useful guide to breeder flock performance, and gives early indication of problems. An egg weight that is too low could be the result of insufficient feed or water intake, high shed tempera- tures or disease. If egg weight is too high, birds may be over - weight or overfed. egg hanDling On larger breeder farms, eggs are collected two to three times a day and kept in a cool place for three to four days before setting. If held for longer than seven days, they must be stored at 16 to 17 \u00b0C. birds will not be able to reach the feeders or drinkers if the lit- ter levels are not kept even. In large commercial operations in colder climates, the building should be pre-heated so the floor is warm and the air temperature close to 32 \u00b0C when the chicks are placed. If provided, lighting should be continuous for the first 48 hours after the chicks arrive. Beak trimming is practised where required to prevent injuri- ous pecking in the flock. Males often need re-trimming before they enter the breeding programme, to reduce the risk of pecking damage to the females during mating. growth anD ProDuCtion During the rearing and growing period for breeder stock the major objective is to control body weight, particularly to ensure that all the birds reach target weight-for-age uniformly. Body weight targets are achieved by controlling feed allowances. Feed amounts during rearing are based on body weight and mainte- nance; during lay, egg production and egg weight are also impor - tant (Cobb-Vantress, 2008a). In meat and layer type birds, body weight uniformity is critical during the first six weeks of the breeders' growth. Weekly body weight increase is a good indicator of how successful the brood-ing has been. High-quality feed of appropriate particle size must be provided to obtain adequate feed intake in the first week. Crop size is a good guide to how well the chicks are consuming feed and water. In developing countries, it is often difficult for breeder farms to meet the body weight standards set for devel- oped countries, owing to poor feed quality and the typically hot environment. During the period from six to 16 weeks, meat and layer breed- ers are usually put on a controlled feeding regime to keep their body weight on target. When the birds reach 16 weeks, they are stimulated by providing up to an hour of additional artificial light per day, to promote sexual development. Particularly in layer strain breeder flocks, it is essential that the female parent achieves sufficient body weight between 16 and 20 weeks of age, to maxi- mize peak egg production and achieve consistent egg production throughout lay. Breeder flock egg production can be optimized by appropriate feeding programmes that ensure that the pullets have uniform body weight. It is also important to keep the breed-ing flock body weight in check after maturity, by handling and weighing birds often and adjusting the feeding levels as required. Layer breeding stock should be fed daily from hatch to end of lay, whereas for broiler breeders during the rearing phase, skip-a- day feeding is often used because of the relatively severe restric- tion that is needed to achieve the desired body weight in these much heavier birds. Uniformity and bird welfare suffer if daily feeding is used, as the more timid birds miss out on their daily allowance. On the alternate days, scratch grain is often provided to reduce hunger. During the laying period, from about 21 weeks of age, broiler breeders are typically fed a restricted amount daily. The restriction at this time is considerably less severe than it is dur - ing the rearing period. Separate-sex feeding is normally practised during the laying period, with males having no access to females' feed, and vice versa. This has more to do with diet composition than quantity, as males have a far lower calcium requirement than females. 36 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry housing and management in developing countriesMaximum hatchability and chick quality can only be achieved when the egg is held under optimum conditions between laying and setting in the incubator (Cobb-Vantress, 2008b). It is normal practice to sanitize hatching eggs prior to setting. Methods com- monly used are formaldehyde fumigation, dipping in ammonium solutions, ultraviolet light and ozone. Eggs should be allowed to cool gradually before being placed in the cool room at a relative humidity of 75 percent. In larger commercial operations, vehicles that maintain a tem- perature of 16 to 18 \u00b0C are used to transport eggs from the breeder farm to the hatchery. Fertile eggs are also maintained under cool conditions when they are transported by air. During loading, care must be taken to avoid egg breakages when car - rying and stacking the egg fillers. Particular care must be taken when transporting eggs on rough roads, which are common in developing countries. reFerenCes Cobb-v antress. & morris, t . 2006.

This is difficult to achieve in village operations, but commercial systems can do so in a number of ways, through whole-house brooding, or partial house brooding to conserve heat and reduce energy costs (Cobb-Vantress, 2008). Correct temperatures are more eas- ily maintained in a small area. Ventilation also needs to be consid-ered, as it distributes heat to the birds and helps maintain good air quality in the brooding area. Chicks are more susceptible to poor air quality than older birds are. High ammonia levels have been shown to reduce the body weight gains of seven-day chicks by 20 percent. In semi-commercial and large-scale operations, lights are need- ed along the brooding area above the heat source in the house, to attract chicks to the feed and water. These lights should be used during the first five days after the chicks arrive, after which background lights should be gradually increased, to reach normal lighting by the tenth day. A well-insulated roof reduces solar heat penetration into the house on warm days, thus decreasing the heat load on the birds. In village settings, many farmers use discarded iron for roofing, but local leaf material made into thatch is preferable (especially in tropical countries), as it insulates the building from extreme heat. In cold weather, a well-insulated roof reduces heat loss and the energy consumption needed to maintain the correct environment for broiler chicks during the brooding phase. In poorly insulated buildings, an area can be set up inside the shed where tempera- ture fluctuations can be minimized by using curtains and a false ceiling running from eave to eave, to reduce heat loss and make temperature control easier. stoCking Density It is essential that meat birds have adequate room, whether they are housed in small groups on village farms or in larger semi- commercial or commercial sheds. Lack of space can lead to leg problems, injuries and increased mortality (Sainsbury, 1988). As they approach market weight, an approximate maximum stock- ing density for fully confined birds on deep litter is 30 kg of bird per square metre of floor area. Drinker management Providing clean, cool water is critical in broiler production. With- out adequate water intake, feed consumption will decline and bird growth will be depressed. There are many types of drinkers; in high temperature conditions, drinkers that allow water circula-tion and cooling are best. In small-scale operations, it is important to keep drinkers topped up, to clean and refill them daily, and to locate them in a cool part of the pen or cage, away from any heat source or the sun's rays. FeeDing management If feeder space is insufficient, growth rates will be reduced and uniformity will be compromised. Feed distribution and the prox- imity of the feeder to the birds are essential for achieving opti- mum feed consumption rates. In tropical developing countries, the main factor reducing feed consumption is high temperatures. Feed should be withheld at the hottest time of the day, to prevent heat stress and the resultant mortality.

Correct stimu- lation of activity during the first five to seven days of life is neces- sary for optimal feed consumption, digestion and immune system development. Reducing the energy required for activity during the middle part of the growing period improves production efficiency. Uniform distribution of light throughout the house is essential. It is recommended that 25 lux at chick height be used during the first week of brooding to encourage early weight gains. For opti- mum performance, light intensity at floor level should not vary by more than 20 percent. After seven days of age, light intensities should be diminished gradually to 5 to 10 lux. CatChing ProCeDures Feed should be withdrawn about eight to 12 hours before birds are sent to slaughter (Barnett et al., 2001). The purpose of this is to empty the digestive tract and prevent ingested feed and faecal material from contaminating the carcasses during processing. It is important that farmers know the local or national regulations concerning the recommended time for feed withdrawal prior to slaughter. reFerenCes Barnett, J.l., glatz, P .C., almond, a., hemsworth, P .h. & Parkinson, g.B. 2001.

In most commercial operations, automated pan or trough and chain feeders are used, providing 2.5 cm of feeder space per bird. To reduce feed spillage, the lip of the feeder should be level with the bird's back. An issue in developing countries is ensuring con- tinuity of feed supply. This can be achieved by having a rodent- proof storage area for keeping at least five days of feed consump- tion. Most village farmers in small-scale operations purchase all the feed required for one grow out. This is essential in remote re- gions, but farmers must store the feed in strong watertight bins, to reduce the risk of rodent attack and of mould and bacterial growth on the feed. litter management Litter management is a crucial aspect of environmental manage- ment, and is fundamental to bird health and performance and to final carcass quality. If the litter is too hard, birds will develop lesions on the keel bone. If the litter is allowed to get wet, birds will develop foot lesions, and the associated high ammonia levels will cause respiratory problems and also affect the birds' immune system. ChiCk PlaCement management In village settings, it is normal to have multi-age flocks. However, it is best practice to place broiler chicks of the same age and flock source in a single house, and attempt to operate an \"all-in, all-out\" production system. Chicks must be carefully placed and evenly distributed near feed and water throughout the brood- ing area. If lights are available, they should initially be set at full intensity in the brooding area, to attract the chicks to the feed source. The first two weeks of a broiler chick's life are critical for its future growth. uniFormity In large commercial operations, the average weight and uniform- ity of a flock are usually determined by taking a random sample of approximately 100 birds and recording their individual weights. Of the 100 birds weighed, the number that is within 10 percent of either side of the average body weight is used to calculate the uniformity, expressed in percentage terms. In a village broiler flock housed in a small enclosure it is important that the farmer 39 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry housing and management in developing countrieshousing and management of layers Phil Glatz , Pig and Poultry Production Institute, SARDI, Roseworthy 5371, South Australia, Australia ChiCk management Modern hybrid layers can be reared successfully in floor and cage brooding systems in developing countries. However, they need more careful management than village chicks, which are better able to cope with temperature fluctuations. Prior to chick arrival, it is important to clean and disinfect the cages or the floor brood- ing area. The brooders should be set up the day before delivery, at 34 to 36 \u00b0C for cage brooding or 35 to 36 \u00b0C for floor brooding (Hyline International, 2009). Drinkers need to be full or the drink- ing system in operation, to encourage birds to drink. If nipple drinkers are used, the water pressure should be reduced so that birds can see the drop of water hanging on the drinker. Feed should be placed on paper if birds are reared in cages. Feeders on the floor should be filled and kept under high light intensity for 20 to 22 hours per day for the first week, to attract the birds. growing PerioD management The first 17 weeks of a pullet's life are critical. Careful manage-ment during this period will allow the bird to meet her perfor - mance potential (Bell and Weaver, 2001). Although it is not al-ways possible to grow pullets in strict isolation from older birds on village farms, it is recommended on semi-commercial and com- mercial farms. During the first six weeks, it is important to provide feed at least twice a day. After five weeks, feed consumption and body weights must be checked. It is good practice to weigh 100 pullets a week during the growing period, beginning at five weeks of age. Pullets should be moved to cages or the laying house at 16 weeks of age, before the onset of sexual maturity. Floor systems management Perches should be provided in the growing and laying house en-vironment. This allows the birds to develop their leg and flight muscles, which is essential for their full utilization of the laying house environment. Perches reduce the social stress of birds in- teracting on the floor, by providing them with a place to roost and get away from other birds in the flock. It is also desirable that birds have access to the same type of feeder and water system in the growing house as they will have in the laying house, although this is not always possible. Birds also need to adapt to the presence of humans, and walk- ing through a poultry house regularly will socialize them. In the laying period, the lighting times need to be synchronized with those in the rearing facility. When birds are placed in the laying house they need to be encouraged to explore the nest boxes. Commercial-scale operations can do this with nest lights to train the birds to use the nests.

Levels of these nutrients can be increased to improve early egg size, and then gradually reduced to control egg size at later ages. moulting Many producers practise induced moulting of the whole flock, which does not involve fasting of the birds. Commercial birds per - form very well after a rest, particularly in the latter weeks of the moult cycle, when they achieve excellent shell quality and persis- tency. The optimum age for moulting is usually about 65 weeks. reFerenCes Bell, D.D. & w eaver, w .D. 2001. Commercial chicken meat and egg production, fifth edition.

Egg numbers, size and livability can be markedly influenced by the lighting programme (Lewis and Morris, 2006). An effective lighting pro- gramme for houses where outside daylight can be excluded in- volves giving pullets 20 to 22 hours of light a day at 30 lux in the first week, reducing this to 20 hours at 5 lux in the second week, and then reducing the photoperiod over the following weeks, to reach ten to 12 hours by seven to nine weeks of age. In open-sided houses, lighting is increased to the longest natu- ral day length from six to 17 weeks of age. It is useful to provide light stimulation when the body weight of commercial hybrids reaches about 1.5 kg. Light can be increased by 15 to 30 minutes per week, until 16 hours of light a day is reached. It is critical that light intensity in housing is increased to 10 to 30 lux. There should be no decrease in day length or light intensity for adult layers. In village poultry production, most birds are exposed to a natural day length, and farmers do not have lighting available to stimulate egg production in village hens. In developing countries, layers are not generally reared or kept in light-controlled housing. The onset of sexual maturity or egg production depends on reaching the minimum chronological age and a minimum body weight (usually about 1.5 kg in commercial hybrids), as well as having adequate nutrient intake to support production, and a constant or increasing day length of at least 12 hours. An optional lighting technique for promoting increased feed consumption is night lighting. This involves turning the lights on for one hour in the middle of the dark period, to allow the birds to feed. egg size management Egg size is largely genetically determined, but can be manipulated by lighting and feeding programmes. The larger the body weight at maturity, the larger the hen's eggs will be for her entire life. Egg weight is thus generally a reasonable indicator of body weight, but in general the earlier a flock begins production, the smaller the egg size will be, and the later the onset of egg production, the larger the egg size. Lighting programmes can be manipulated to influence rate of maturity (Bell and Weaver, 2001). A decreas- ing light pattern continuing past ten weeks of age delays maturity and increases average egg size. Egg size is greatly affected by the intake of energy, total fat, crude protein, methionine and cystine Semi-intensive sector 3 type Olaf Thieme Photo Credit: Robert Pym41 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry housing and management in developing countriesmanagement and housing of semi-scavenging flocks Robert Pym , School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Gatton, 4343, Queensland, Australia The large majority of families in rural regions of many developing countries own small household flocks of semi-scavenging poultry (mostly chickens), which often make significant contributions to poverty alleviation and household food security (Alders and Pym, 2009). However, the increasing density of human settlements has resulted in a decrease in the scavenging feed resource base (SFRB) in urban and peri-urban areas. This, combined with government action associated with the risks of disease transfer, particularly highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), to humans and com- mercial poultry, is leading to a steady reduction in the number of peri-urban scavenging flocks of family poultry in many countries, and the large majority of these flocks are now located in rural regions. Small (five to 30-bird) family-owned flocks, usually of indig- enous breed or crossbred birds, are given household food scraps and sometimes small amounts of grain or grain by-products, and spend much of their time during daylight hours scavenging around the house and yard for seeds, insects, snails, earthworms, grass, shoots, fallen fruit, frogs, etc., depending on the local envi- ronment and season. Household scraps and supplementary grain typically comprise a significant proportion of the energy intake of these birds, particularly in the dry season (see website on Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countries). Birds are not usually provided with water, so have to obtain it from the environment. This can have a marked impact on their health and productivity, particularly in the dry season.housing One of the defining features of the semi-scavenging production system is the lack of management compared with most other production systems (Gueye, 2000). The birds are very much on their own, and their productivity is usually quite limited by the typically meagre nutritional inputs they receive. Housing is mostly limited to some form of enclosure for the birds at night, to protect them from predation, theft and environmental exposure, and to provide a site for supplementary feeding. Enclosures also make it possible to catch birds for vaccination, although this is by no means a regular or common practice with semi-scavenging poul-try. Birds' night shelters may be a separate structure, under the human dwelling, or even within their owner's home. However, it is not unusual for birds to be provided with no shelter, and to roost in trees at night. Where a separate structure is available, it is usually a simple construction made from local materials. Indigenous breed birds are seldom reared or housed in confine- ment, as their productivity (egg and meat production), even un-der good-quality ad libitum feeding, is insufficient to warrant the cost of this level of management. Confinement rearing may be justified for some higher-producing indigenous strains or cross- breeds, where there is a niche market for their eggs or meat. Con- versely, improved breed/strain commercial birds cannot perform at their genetic potential under semi-scavenging management conditions, so are not suitable for this form of production. The survival of commercial genotypes (particularly broilers) is severely compromised under scavenging systems.Household flock of scavenging chickens provided with nigh-time shelter under the human dwelling (Myanmar) Semi-scavenging poultry production (Lao PDR)Photo Credit: Viengsavanh Phimphachanhvongsod Photo Credit: Joerg HenningHen and young chicks kept in cages for the first two weeks post-hatch (Philippines) 42 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry housing and management in developing countriesmanagement interventions In many countries, aid projects involving scavenging poultry flocks have demonstrated that it is possible to reduce chick attrition rates dramatically by practising confinement rearing of the chicks with the hen for the first week or two, supplemental feeding of the hen and creep-feeding of the chicks over this period, and reg- ular vaccination of all birds in the flock, including chicks, against Newcastle disease (Henning et al., 2009). These measures allow farming families to rear all surviving chicks to about six weeks, but the birds must also be provided with adequate nutrition from the SFRB or supplementary feeding until they are slaughtered or sold. If the SFRB is inadequate, and supplementary feed is either not available or is too expensive, the family has the option of setting fewer eggs under the hen, and either eating or selling the surplus. This is the most sustainable option in most situations, but may not be readily accepted in all cultures and communities. Males surplus to requirements for breeding or cock fighting are kept for slaughter. Owing to high levels of chick attrition, this will often apply to only one or two birds per hatch. The large major - ity of village chicken strains in many developing countries grow slowly, even on relatively high levels of nutrition. Birds are typi- cally slaughtered at about 1.0 to 1.5 kg live-weight at somewhere between 12 and 20 weeks of age. Management of these birds is usually the same as for the rest of the flock, receiving household scraps and small amounts of grain or grain by-products every day to supplement their scavenging. The use of larger-bodied cross- bred birds can have deleterious consequences where feed inputs are restricted, as the growing birds may receive sufficient food to meet only their maintenance requirements. This also applies to larger-bodied laying hens, when egg production can suffer. One of the major constraints to improving productivity in many regions is the limited availability of suitable prepared feed or feed ingredients for hens and young chicks in the first week or two following hatch. In these regions, considerable efforts are needed Poultry house for overnight shelter (Mozambique) House with woven banana-leaf nests for chickens under the eaves (Philippines) egg management anD reProDuCtive PerFormanCe Most rural families keeping small flocks of poultry provide the hens with nests; nests constructed of woven banana leaves or similar materials are very suitable and common in the wet tropics. These are often placed off the ground, to reduce problems with predation. The hen typically lays a clutch of ten to 15 eggs in the nest, and then sits on them. In some cases, the owner might take a number of eggs for eating or sale, but in most communities and cultures the majority of the eggs laid are left in the nest to be hatched by the hen. Most indigenous hens are excellent incu- bators, and typically ten chicks hatch from a setting of 12 eggs. However, in many cases, fewer than five of these will survive to six weeks of age, owing to predation, disease, malnutrition and climatic exposure.Photo Credit: Filomena Credit: Eugene Lanada Photo Credit: Eugene Lanada43 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry housing and management in developing countriesto identify suitable locally available ingredients and diets that pro- vide the nutrients required by chicks and hens at this stage. reFerenCes alders, r.g. & Pym, r.a.e. 2009.

Ad- vances in knowledge and technology over recent decades favour the growth and intensification of poultry production in develop- ing countries where there are increasing human populations and economic constraints. Issues related to the environment, human health and the quality of life for people living near to and distant from poultry production operations make waste management a critical consideration for the long-term growth and sustainability of poultry production in larger bird facilities located near urban and peri-urban areas, as well as for smaller commercial systems associated with live bird markets, and for village and backyard flocks located in rural areas. These information notes focus primarily on medium-sized to large intensive poultry production units, but many of the princi- ples apply to smaller operations, including small family scaveng- ing flocks. Fundamental knowledge of the environmental and health issues associated with poultry waste management will serve both small and large poultry producers now and in the fu-ture, as the intensification of poultry production continues to gain favour globally. Potential Pollutants anD issues relateD to Poultry ProDuction The production of poultry results in: hatchery wastes, manure (bird excrement), litter (bedding materials such as sawdust, wood shavings, straw and peanut or rice hulls), and on-farm mortalities. The processing of poultry results in additional waste materials, including offal (feathers, entrails and organs of slaughtered birds), processing wastewater and biosolids. Most of these by-products can provide organic and inorganic nutrients that are of value if managed and recycled properly, regardless of flock size. However, they also give rise to potential environmental and human health concerns as the sources of elements, compounds (including veter - inary pharmaceuticals), vectors for insects and vermin, and patho- genic microorganisms. With the probable exception of veterinary pharmaceuticals, these factors are also relevant to small flocks, including small family flocks that may be partially housed in con- tainment structures. Managing these poultry by-products as potential pollutants centres on water and air quality concerns, and in some cases on soil quality (FAO, 2008; Nahm and Nahm, 2004; Williams, Barker and Sims, 1999). Specific concerns that are well documented include degradation of nearby surface and/or groundwater, re- sulting from increased loading of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus (and potassium in some locations). Air quality issues are less well understood and include the fate and effect of am-monia, hydrogen sulphide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and dust particulates emitted from poultry production facilities. Greenhouse gas emissions and health effects associated with nui- sance odorants are also emerging and/or relevant issues, owing to global climate change and increasing human populations in close proximity to poultry operations, respectively. water and soil impacts of potential pollutants from poultry production Most poultry manure and litter are applied to land near poul- try production farms. With few exceptions, this is the preferred practice in developing countries and elsewhere. Such land man- agement of poultry by-products brings the risk of surface and groundwater contamination from potential pollutants contained in the manure and litter. Its value depends on several factors, in- cluding the agronomic potential of the receiving crop(s) to utilize the waste nutrients, the receiving soil type and specific geological Housing conditions that promote good ventilation, non leaking waters and drier manure and litter results in healthier birds and manure of better nutrient value for crop fertilizer.

Brake Excessive dust on surfaces and equipment in poultry housing should be regularly cleaned to reduce environmentally harmful bio-aerosols. 47 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry waste management in developing countriesdesign, and manure and litter storage and treatment practices, such as methods for applying them to land. Hydrogen sulphide and other VOCs can result from the met- abolic breakdown of poultry waste products, generally under low-oxygen conditions such as occur when manure is allowed to ferment (anaerobically digest) in a pit beneath the birds, in an earthen lagoon or in other open-air containment. This type of waste operation is more common with swine or dairy livestock than poultry, but may occur in some locations with layer opera- tions. Under open-air fermentation, hydrogen sulphide and VOCs can be emitted into the atmosphere as pollutants, and can also be components of nuisance odour. Hydrogen sulphide can be dangerous to humans at certain concentrations. Donham and Thelin (2006) note that agitation of manure slurry in pits beneath animals can result in rapid elevation of ambient hydrogen sul- phide to lethal concentrations, within seconds. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2000) notes an air quality guideline for hy- drogen sulphide of 0.15 mg/m 3 averaged over a 24-hour period. Particulate matter (or dust) is an aerial pollutant of more con- cern than hydrogen sulphide and VOCs. It occurs in typical poul- try operations where appreciable numbers of birds are confined. Dust emissions can contain dried fecal matter and may include bacteria, endotoxins, moulds, mites and insect parts (Clark, Ry- lander and Larsson, 1983). Dust emissions from housing facili- ties are highly variable, depending on the climate, building de- sign, feed consistency (dry or pellet) and control mechanisms for preventing large dust particles from leaving the area near the building - in recent years, considerable progress has been made in developing low-cost dust barriers to prevent dust dispersion (Poultry Science Association, 2009). Fine particulate matter (e.g., PM-fine) resulting from the conversion of ammonia gas in the atmosphere into ammonium salts can have greater consequences for human health, and is less likely to be mitigated by dust barrier approaches for preventing larger dust particles. This is another of the factors that make aerial ammonia emissions so important. Climatic conditions play a very significant role in the impacts from aerial poultry pollutants, regardless of flock size. For ex-ample, excessively dry conditions, especially in litter, result in in- creased respiratory conditions affecting birds' productivity, while conditions of the land being utilized, the distance to nearby sur - face and groundwaters, the amount of vegetated areas (riparian buffers) adjacent to nearby surface waters, and the climate. Nutri- ent loading and build-up within a geological region is ecologically important and has an impact on the diversity and productivity of essential, naturally occurring living organisms within that region (Gundersen, 1992). The issue is increasingly complex owing to the trend for producing meat and eggs under intensified systems that require grain to be imported into production regions to meet feedstock requirements. This often leads to nutrient imbalances, and adverse environmental or health effects can occur when land application of the nutrients exceeds crop utilization potential, or if poor management results in nutrient loss due to soil erosion or surface runoff during rainfall. Surface or groundwater contami- nation by manure nutrients and pathogens is especially serious if drinking-water supplies are affected. The primary nutrients of concern are nitrogen and phosphorus. The nitrogen compounds contained in manure and litter are very dynamic and can be removed from land by uptake of the receiv- ing crop harvest or by conversion to gases that volatilize into the atmosphere in the form of ammonia, nitrous oxides or harmless di-nitrogen. Nitrogen is also very mobile in soil, and may be trans- ported to groundwater and/or nearby surface waters. Unlike ni- trogen, phosphorus in manure and litter is very immobile, but can leach into shallow groundwater or laterally transport to surface waters via erosion or subsurface runoff under certain climatic, soil and phosphorus concentration conditions. Nitrogen in the form of nitrates in drinking-water can cause adverse health effects; and both nitrogen and phosphorus in certain concentrations and envi- ronmental conditions can result in degradation of surface waters. Regarding nutrient loading from poultry manure and litter, the focus is mainly on nitrogen and phosphorus, but certain metals such as copper and zinc, which may also be contained in poultry excreta, should also be considered when planning long-term sus- tainable nutrient balance in soils receiving poultry waste. In cer - tain soil conditions, a build-up of these metals can be detrimental (toxic) for some crops (Zublena, 1994). air quality impacts of potential pollutants from poultry production Air quality can be affected by aerial emissions of pollutants from poultry production facilities. Ammonia emitted into the atmos- phere is arguably the most environmentally significant aerial pol- lutant associated with poultry production (FAO, 2006). The trans- port and fate of ammonia once it is emitted into the atmosphere are not well understood, but its presence in high concentrations can trigger environmental effects that have impacts on local eco- systems and human health. As such, consideration of the envi- ronmental effects on airsheds and watersheds of nutrient loading from poultry production is important for long-term sustainabil-ity. Ammonia from poultry operations is derived from nitrogen, which is an essential component of dietary protein, amino acids and other biomolecules necessary for life. However, dietary ni- trogen not converted into meat, eggs or other tissue is excreted in the form of organic nitrogen, which is rapidly converted into ammonia under most, but not all, poultry production practices. The amount of ammonia actually emitted into the atmosphere depends on multiple variables, including climate, poultry housing Photo Credit: John T. Brake48 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry waste management in developing countriesexcessively wet litter results in increased ammonia concentrations (and pathogenic microorganisms), which are also detrimental to productivity. oPtions anD consiDerations for Poultry waste management The planning, construction and operation of poultry meat and egg operations of any size must consider issues associated with storing, managing and utilizing potential waste by-products. On a global scale, much research has been conducted on ways of re- covering nutrients and value-added organic products from animal wastes, to improve agricultural efficiency and mitigate environ- mental impacts in their regions. Many systems and approaches can be successful if properly operated and maintained. land application of crop nutrients Globally, poultry manure or litter has been applied to land to en-hance crop production for centuries. When properly managed, this is an effective and beneficial option. Environmental pollution occurs when manure or litter is applied to the land in excess of the receiving crop's capacity to utilize the nutrients. Other factors that influence the environmental fate of the manure and litter applied include methods of collecting, storing, handling, treating, transporting and applying the waste by-products to the receiv- ing land. For example, with non-liquid-flush systems, the poultry housing and manure storage area should be designed so that the manure and litter are kept as dry as possible, to minimize aerial emissions of gases and assist fly control. Manure and litter stor - age should be planned to prevent contact with rainfall or rain runoff. Land application should be based on the agronomic up- take of the receiving crop, accurate analysis of the nutrients con- tained in the manure (particularly nitrogen, phosphorus, copper and zinc) and properly calibrated application methods; it should be avoided when the land is frozen or excessively wet. Land ap- plication methods that incorporate the manure or litter directly into the soil minimize odour and gas emissions and surface run- off. These principles also apply to small family operations, whose sanitation will be improved by periodically removing manure or litter from areas where just a few birds are housed, and by stor - ing, composting and/or land-applying the product at least 100 m from where the live birds are kept. Composting is a natural aerobic biological process to break- down organic matter, which provides a practical and economical- ly feasible method for stabilizing poultry manure and litter before land application (Carr, 1994). Correctly managed composting effectively binds nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in organic forms, and reduces pathogens, insect eggs and weed seed owing to the heat generated during the biological process- ing. Composting can also reduce nuisance odour emissions from poultry waste storage and treatment areas. A variety of compost- ing approaches, from very simple to more complex automated systems, are available for both large and small poultry producers. In areas where manure or litter is land-applied near streams or surface waters, an exceptionally simple and effective approach for mitigating surface runoff or the subsurface flow of potential harmful nutrients is to maintain a natural riparian buffer next to the water resources (Wenger, 1999). Riparian buffers may com- prise native grasses, shrubs or trees, or a combination of these. The width and make-up of a riparian buffer are specific to its location, and the width of the buffer from the stream edge de- termines its effectiveness. Natural grass buffers of approximately 10 m wide have been shown to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus from field surface runoff by approximately 25 percent, while com- bined grass and tree buffers are much more effective. This prac- tice is a documented inexpensive natural method of protecting water resources from the nutrients and pathogenic microorgan-isms contained in nearby land-applied poultry manure or litter. animal refeeding Scientific research has documented that nutrients and energy from poultry waste by-products, including manure and litter, can be safely recycled as a component of livestock and poultry diets when pathogens are neutralized (McCaskey, 1995). Poultry litter has been estimated to be as much as three times more valuable as a feedstuff than as a fertilizer for crop nutrients. However, such practices depend on regional regulations and public perceptions of the concept of animals' consumption of fecal material, regard- less of its documented value and safety. If practised, caution is es- sential. For example, copper toxicity can result when litter is fed to sheep. Incorrectly processed poultry waste can contain potentially pathogenic microorganisms, including Salmonella. Depending on environmental conditions and the global region of production, antibiotics, arsenicals and mycotoxins can also be present in poul- try manures and litters. The refeeding of poultry processing by-products is a common and acceptable practice in most, but not all, cultures. Advances in the treatment and processing of feathers and offal to produce value-added feed ingredients are making this practice more at-tractive in some regions, especially with the recent increases for feeds derived from grains. Bioenergy production Poultry manure and litter contain organic matter that can be con- verted into bioenergy under certain processing technologies. One of the most common approaches for poultry excrement managed by water flushing (e.g., some layer operations) is anaerobic di- gestion, which yields biogas, a gas mixture with varying concen- Manure from this facility can improve the nearby grass yield for grazing cattle when properly managed. Photo Credit: John T. Brake49 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry waste management in developing countriestrations of combustible methane (FAO/CMS, 1996). The biogas can be used as an on-farm energy source for heat or as a fuel for various engines that generate electricity. An additional advan- tage is that, depending on processing conditions, anaerobically digested manure solids and liquids are further stabilized and more acceptable and safe for use as a fertilizer or feed supplement. Numerous technologies and approaches are available for on-farm or centralized anaerobic digestion, and all are influenced by mul- tiple variables that affect biogas yield and efficiency - operational feasibility and effective management are critical to the success of this process, especially with some of the more complex anaerobic digester technologies. Unfavourable economic and other issues associated with operational feasibility, and low biogas yield from litter-based systems have discouraged many poultry producers worldwide from implementing this technology. Poultry litter and dry manure can be incinerated for on-farm production of heat in small furnaces, or transported to central locations where they are combusted on a large scale for the gen- eration of electricity. For both approaches, the amount of energy produced depends on the efficiency of the equipment utilized and the moisture content of the manure or litter burned. Op- erational feasibility and emission issues also affect this process, especially for on-farm small conventional furnaces. Gasification technology is a way of producing bioenergy that is receiving renewed interest for small on-farm systems and central electric power stations in some regions. The process involves in- complete combustion in a limited-oxygen environment. As noted for both anaerobic digester technology and incineration units, economic costs and returns, operational feasibility and emission issues have an impact on the implementation of this technology. However, increasing energy costs, environmental policy related to mandated renewable energy production goals in some regions, and the evolving carbon credit market are stimulating interest in all technologies for processing poultry and other waste products that yield bioenergy and reduce greenhouse emissions. references carr, l. 1994.

Carolina Feed Industry Associa-tion, Raleigh, NC - USA 2765850 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry waste management in developing countriesintroDuction Knowledge of the amounts and compositions of manure and lit- ter produced under different poultry production practices is es-sential for efficient and environmentally responsible management of these by-products as fertilizer, animal feed components or fuel. This knowledge is also required for the effective planning, imple- mentation and operation of a waste management system that is appropriate for the number and type of birds in a given environ-ment. manure quantity Manure quantity and characteristics are influenced by the spe-cies, age, diet and health of the birds and by farm management practices. Estimates of the manure excreted by 1 000 birds per day (based on average daily live weights during the birds' produc- tion cycle) are approximately 120 kg for layer chickens, 80 kg for meat chickens, 200 to 350 kg for turkeys (grower females and grower heavy males, respectively), and 150 kg for ducks (Collins et al., 1999; Williams, Barker and Sims, 1999). Extrapolations can be calculated to give general estimates for the number of birds in a given operation. After excretion, the quantity of manure requiring management depends on factors such as water content, whether the manure is stored in a location where rainfall collects, or whether it is mixed with materials such as straw, wood shavings or rice hulls, as is typical in meat bird housing. Estimates of the litter produced by 1 000 meat birds produced for market range from 1.1 to 2.4 tonnes for chickens, 7.3 to 12.7 tonnes for turkeys (grower fe- males and grower heavy males, respectively), and 3.9 tonnes for ducks (Collins et al., 1999; Williams, Barker and Sims, 1999). Again, extrapolations can be calculated to give general estimates for the number of birds in a given operation. However, these val- ues can be greatly influenced by management practices, such as whether fresh litter is added to existing litter after each growing cycle of birds, or a portion of the manure \"cake\" is removed from the existing litter prior to adding fresh litter.manure nutrients The scientific literature contains reliable and comprehensive in- formation based on average values from a wide database, on the chemical (nutrient) and physical composition of manures and lit- ter (see the references at the end of this note). Estimates of some environmentally important nutrients in manure are given in Table 1. They can vary according to the composition of ingredients in the birds' feed, and especially if the birds scavenge for all or part of their diet. Although the estimated manure weight as excreted may not vary significantly by bird type, it is essential that spe- cific manure nutrient characteristics and concentrations be deter - mined by reliable sampling and testing. Manure and litter storage conditions influence some nutrient concentrations; for example, appreciable ammonia may be lost to the atmosphere from manure or litter that is stored in areas exposed to rain or groundwater.

Preventing contact with birds of differing species and other animals should be a part of good management practices. 51 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry waste management in developing countriesenvironmentally sound, nor is it an efficient way of conserving nitrogen to be utilized for crop growth. The phosphorus content will not change significantly under such increased moisture condi- tions. To ensure agronomic balance and environmental manage- ment that prevent the overapplication of nutrients, it is there- fore important to coordinate sampling activities with the timing of land application for maximum crop yields, rather than relying solely on established values or those measured when the manure was in the production house or during early storage. It is also very important to estimate the availability of the crop nutrients in manure or litter (Shaffer, 2009). manure microorganisms anD veterinary PHarmaceuticals Poultry manure and litter contain populations of naturally occur - ring microorganisms, many of which are environmentally ben- eficial and play important roles in the ecological nutrient cycles associated with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur and other elements in poultry by-products. However, depending on man- agement and environmental conditions, poultry manure and litter can also contain harmful pathogenic microorganisms that affect human health. Chemical residues in the form of veterinary phar - maceuticals (antibiotics, coccidiostats and larvicides) may also be contained in poultry manure and litter (Sims and Wolf, 1994), depending on diet formulation, management practices and the regulation of poultry production enterprises in a given region. Ac- curate sampling and laboratory analyses of the harmful microor - ganisms and chemical residues contained in manure and litter are critical to the implementation of effective mitigation practices. references. collins, e.r., Barker, J.c., carr, l.e., Brodie, H.l. & martin, Ithaca, New York, USA, Natural Resource, Agriculture, and Engineering Service (NRAES). www.nraes.org. shaffer, K. 2009.

Brake52 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry waste management in developing countriesaerosol contamination Charles Michael Williams , North Carolina State University, Department of Poultry Science, Raleigh NC, United States of America introDuction Aerosol contamination from poultry production can generally be characterized as pollutants, including gases (such as ammonia), particulates (dust) and microbial pathogens suspended in the airspace within and transported from the birds' housing or con- tainment areas. Dust from poultry operations can include feed dust, manure, feather dust, bacteria, mould spores, endotoxins, insects, insect parts and ammonia absorbed in dust. The transport of aerosols can be an important consideration when establishing the separation distances between poultry production facilities to reduce the risk of aerial transmission of communicable disease-transmitting microorganisms. Depending on their concentration, aerosol pollutants can be harmful to the respiratory health of birds within the containment areas, and may also be harmful to the health of workers or inhabitants living close to poultry pro- duction areas. However, at the international level, comprehensive studies regarding the human health effects of aerosols from poul- try operations are lacking. Aerial-transported ammonia can affect local and distant eco- systems, depending on the ecological sensitivity of the water source(s) into which the ammonia is deposited as dry or wet fall. Aerosol ammonia is also a precursor gas for ambient particulate matter, under certain atmospheric conditions, and there is evi- dence of negative human health effects from exposure to particu- late matter, especially fine particulate matter. Regardless of their location or size, existing and new poultry production operations should consider mitigating the risks associ- ated with aerosol emissions to ensure the future sustainability of poultry production practices. source anD emission of aerosols Even under the best management conditions, poultry production can be a source of aerosol contaminants, including gases, odour, dust and microorganisms. These gaseous compounds and living organisms are generated from natural biological processes associ- ated with poultry manure decomposition soon after the manure is produced, during manure and litter storage and treatment, and during application of the manure or litter to fertilize cropland. Par - ticulate matter as dust can originate from both feed and the birds. However, the generation rate of these gases, microorganisms and particulates is highly variable, depending on the weather, the spe-cies and age of the birds, housing conditions, and the manure handling system, feed type and management system(s) used. Once aerosol pollutants are generated, they can be emitted from their sources through the production unit's ventilation sys-tem, which is characteristic of larger units, or by natural weather-sourced ventilation, in smaller or naturally ventilated larger units. The emission rates of the pollutants depend on many factors in- cluding time of year and day, temperature, humidity, wind speed and other weather conditions, ventilation rates, housing type, and manure properties and characteristics - for example, dryer manure and litter result in more particulate emission, while moist conditions are likely to result in increased emission of ammonia. It is extremely difficult to determine specific aerosol emission rates from point sources such as poultry housing units, manure or litter storage areas, and during application to cropland, and definitive information is lacking. This remains a very active area of research in many parts of the world. effects of aerosol Pollution Aerosol emissions can compromise bird health and productivity (feed conversion, meat and egg yield). Aerosol emissions from poultry operations can transmit communicable diseases to neigh- bouring poultry flocks; scientific evidence shows that some path- ogenic microorganisms can remain viable and be transported for appreciable distances (from 50 to more than 500 m) in ambient air. Evidence also shows that the health of farm workers can be affected by day-to-day exposure to aerosols. Primary effects are on respiratory function, which is not surprising considering the composition of typical aerosol pollutants associated with poultry production (ammonia, dust, microorganisms and endotoxins). Clean housing surfaces, good ventilation and good management will reduce risks caused by bio-aerosols in poultry houses. Photo Credit: John T.

Technolo- gies such as biofilters and/or bioscrubbers as components of point source ventilation exhausts are not economically practical in de- veloping and many developed countries. Farm workers can re- duce health risks by practising good hygiene and wearing pro- tective eye shields and dust masks when possible and practical, especially in dusty poultry production environments. references fao. 2006.

A growing body of evidence shows that appreciable concentrations of ammonia are released from poultry (and live- stock) production operations; increases in nitrogen concentration resulting from wet and dry atmospheric deposition of ammonia are having serious impacts on some ecosystems globally (resulting in decreased forest productivity, increased nitrate concentrations in surface and groundwaters, and increased risk of eutrophication); and ammonia is a precursor gas for the formation of ambient fine particulate matter (human exposure to elevated fine particulate matter has been linked to a variety of adverse health effects, in- cluding acute respiratory conditions and increased mortality risks). mitigating tHe risKs of aerosol Pollution The most effective strategy for reducing aerosol pollution is to reduce its source.

There is increased attention to and awareness of the environmental and human health impacts - real or perceived - of animal agriculture. The demand for poultry meat and eggs will likely increase in the next decades, but in most parts of the world, the proportion of the population participating in day-to-day on- farm activities is steadily decreasing - a trend that is likely to con- tinue. Although small backyard and scavenging poultry flocks are becoming more popular in some urban areas of developed coun-tries, global demand for production and economic efficiency are likely to result in larger concentrated production farms continuing to be more prevalent in most regions. Small and scavenging flocks controlled by cooperatives, villag- ers and families are prevalent in rural areas of some developing countries, where they contribute to poverty alleviation and food security. However, as larger production farms become more com- mon in these countries, siting issues regarding biosecurity will have an impact on small-scale village and family flocks, possibly leading to conflict if proper management practices are not exer - cised. The sustainability and potential expansion of any poultry production or processing operation are affected by its location, especially in the long term. This is particularly true of operations located near urban or peri-urban areas. These factors demand careful planning of the location and siting of poultry production units. Failure to take such planning considerations into account when constructing new and larger facilities may result in costly changes or management expenditures in the future. Planning consiDerations infrastructure, water, regulatory requirements and permits A first step in planning the location of any poultry unit includes assessing the existing infrastructure support, especially for larger units; for example, does the location have adequate roadways and utilities to support the transport of inputs and outputs and ensure the unit's energy requirements? The adequacy and supply of fresh and safe water to support the unit's production and op- erational needs should also be determined. The available labour force should be considered: larger farms need dependable work- ers, who should - as far as possible - live in areas without poten- tial disease reservoir birds (village and scavenging flocks). The reg-ulatory requirements for the region must be accurately assessed. These may involve setback stipulations from property lines, water sources, residences, roadways, schools and churches; develop- ment and implementation of comprehensive nutrient manage- ment plans that apply to the watershed or airshed in which the unit will be located; and acquisition of necessary permits. near neighbour assessment The potential for affecting neighbours or neighbourhoods with nuisance emissions (primarily odour) and/or flies cannot be ig- nored. The management and operational efficiency of any opera- tion can be negatively affected if sufficient time and effort are not given to resolving conflicts resulting from nuisance complaints and potential litigation, even if all regulatory and permit require- ments are met.

This is also true of very small-scale processing facilities and village and home (backyard) flock operations. The World Bank Group (2007) provides detailed and useful environmental health and safety guidelines for all steps of poultry processing, from the reception of live birds, through slaughter and evisceration, to simple waste processing. This infor - mation note focuses on the utilization of organic solids, of which an estimated 1 million tonnes are generated every year world- wide. As for poultry production wastes (manure and litter), these organic solids should be considered both potential resources and potential environmental pollutants, depending on how they are processed and managed. Similarly, the siting of slaughterhouses, like that of production facilities, should give careful consideration to biosecurity and near neighbour issues. The size of the slaughter facility also has implications for environmental and food safety practices and issues - again, the size issue is similar for poultry production facilities. The treatment and environmental fate of processing wastewa- ter and organic solid wastes should be based on site-specific re-quirements, regulations and the location of the slaughterhouse. For example, some regions have very specific requirements for the organic and inorganic wastes that are discharged into surface waters following treatment, and some have restrictions or regula- tions for the processed solids destined for animal feed compo- nents. When possible, the treatment of solid waste should aim to produce value-added sellable by-products, such as animal or aquaculture feed components, energy (through biogas produc-tion) and agricultural fertilizer. For very small or backyard flock operations, slaughter is likely to generate very small quantities of solid wastes, and the management of these wastes should focus more on proper disposal and recycling (burial or composting) re- garding biosecurity and human health issues. comPosition, cHaracteriZation anD reProcessing of slaugHterHouse soliDs Poultry carcass yields are typically about 70 to 75 percent of the live bird weight; the quantity of potentially sellable solid waste depends on the efficiency of the processing methods and the health of the birds prior to processing. Blood is approximately 2 percent of the live bird weight, and a source of highly concentrated protein when filtered and dried to produce blood meal. During slaughter, blood is typically collected separately from the other viscera and, depending on cooling con-ditions and storage time prior to further processing, may require chemicals to prevent coagulation. Processed blood meal can be used in animal and fish feed as well as fertilizer. Feathers comprise approximately 7 to 10 percent of the live bird weight and are another source of protein (75 to 90 percent crude protein), although the utilization value of feathers as an animal feed component depends on further processing methods (e.g., high-pressure cooking at > 100 OC or enzymatic treatment) to improve digestibility. Processed feathers can also be used for bedding, clothing and other niche market items for humans. The head, feet (recovered for human consumption in some regions) and inedible viscera make up the remainder of slaugh-terhouse solids. Following further processing by methods such as conventional rendering at specified temperatures and pres- sures, depending on the intended fate and risk factor of the ma- terial, sellable products in the form of protein-rich meals and fat are produced. Extensive further processing of these by-products may not be required in some areas, if biosecurity precautions are taken. For example, high-quality inedible viscera wastes are in great demand for intensive fish culture in some regions, and may require only simple on-farm grinding and mixing with a binder prior to use. Regardless of location, before reprocessing, slaughterhouse solids can be broadly characterized as low-risk material originat- ing from healthy birds, and high-risk material that may transmit disease to humans, livestock or poultry. For example, high-risk material would originate from birds that died from causes other than slaughtering, or birds or bird parts condemned as unfit for human consumption. Birds confirmed or suspected of carrying transmittable disease, especially a disease such as highly patho- genic avian influenza (HPIA), should be characterized as high-risk material. Care and management steps should be taken to keep high-risk materials separate from low-risk materials, as mixing of the two results in the entire batch being classified as high-risk. This is important not only for health and safety precautions but also for economic reasons related to the additional processing re- quirements for high-risk versus low-risk materials. The treatment of high-risk material intended for animal feed or fertilizer is typi-cally an energy-intensive rendering or alternative heat treatment process, whereas reprocessing of low-risk material may include less stringent methods to make use of the solids for animal or aq- uaculture feed. For materials that are not suitable for processing into the food chain, alternative methods to be considered include approved burial, aerobic composting or treatments for energy production and/or processing for use as agricultural fertilizers. slaughterhouse wastes Charles Michael Williams , North Carolina State University, Department of Poultry Science, Raleigh NC, United States of America57 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry waste management in developing countriesThe utilization of slaughterhouse solid by-products for animal feed is becoming increasingly restricted in many parts of the world. In such areas, anaerobic digestion - the biological degradation of organic matter into methane under anaerobic conditions - is an alternative that provides an opportunity for energy recovery and, depending on the type of anaerobic digestion employed, for re- ducing pathogenic microorganism in the solid substrate digested. Properly managed, anaerobic digestion can also reduce nuisance odours associated with slaughterhouse wastes, and conserve the non-carbon nutrient components in the digested material, which can be recovered for fertilizer or possible feed use. Salminen and Rintala (2002) provide a comprehensive review and relevant infor - mation to determine the applicability of anaerobic digestion and material recovery from poultry slaughterhouse waste. references salminen, e. & rintala, J. 2002.

Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countries Poultry DeveloPment review60 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countriesPoultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countries Velmurugu Ravindran , Monogastric Research Centre, Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand Worldwide, production of poultry meat and eggs has increased consistently over the years, and this trend is expected to continue. It is predicted that most increases in poultry production during the next two decades will occur in developing countries, where rapid economic growth, urbanization and higher household incomes will increase the demand for animal proteins. Several factors have contributed to the consistent growth in world poultry produc- tion, including: i) genetic progress in poultry strains for meat and egg production; ii) better understanding of the fundamentals of nutrition; and iii) disease control. For example, the age for a meat chicken to reach the market weight of 2 kg has steadily decreased from 63 days in 1976 to 35 days in 2009, and the efficiency of converting feed into poultry products also continues to improve. This growth in poultry production is having a profound effect on the demand for feed and raw materials. Feed is the most impor - tant input for poultry production in terms of cost, and the avail-ability of low-priced, high-quality feeds is critical if poultry pro- duction is to remain competitive and continue to grow to meet the demand for animal protein. ProDuction systems anD feeDing Historically, the poultry sector has evolved through three phases: i) traditional systems, which include family poultry consisting of scavenging birds and backyard raising; ii) small-scale semi-com- mercial systems; and iii) large-scale commercial systems. Each of these systems is based on a unique set of technologies. They dif- fer markedly in investment, type of birds used, husbandry level and inputs such as feeds. The feed resources, feeding and feed requirements required to raise poultry also vary widely, depending on the system used. The traditional system is the most common type of poultry pro- duction in most developing countries. Possible feed resources for the local birds raised in this system include: i) household wastes; ii) materials from the environment (insects, worms, snails, greens, seeds, etc.); iii) crop residues, fodders and water plants; and iv) by-products from local small industrial units (cereal by-products, etc.). The survival and growth of extensive poultry systems are determined by the competition for feed resources in villages. This system works well where biomass is abundant, but in areas with scarce natural resources and low rainfall, the competition for nat-ural resources with other animals can be extreme. Between the two extremes of traditional and commercial pro- duction systems is the semi-commercial system, which is charac- terized by small to medium-sized flocks (50 to 500 birds) of local, crossbred or \"improved\" genotype stock, and the purchase of at least part of their feed from commercial compounders. Several feeding strategies may be used in this system: i) on-farm mixing of complete rations, using purchased and locally available feed ingredients; ii) dilution of purchased commercial feeds with local ingredients; and iii) blending of a purchased concentrate mixture with local ingredients or whole grains. The large-scale commercial system is the dominant production system in developed countries, and this sector has also recently expanded in many developing countries. Commercial systems are characterized by large vertically integrated production units and use high-producing modern strains of birds. In these systems, feed is the most important variable cost component, accounting for 65 to 70 percent of production costs. High productivity and efficiency depend on feeding nutritionally balanced feeds that are formulated to meet the birds' nutritional requirements. Poultry neeD to be feD well-balanceD Diets Most poultry species are omnivores, which in nutritional terms means that they have a simple digestive system with non-func- tional caeca. Exceptions to this general rule include geese and ostriches, which have well-developed functional caeca. The di- gestive tract of poultry has more organs but is shorter than that of other domestic animals. The unique features of this digestive tract include the crop, which is a storage organ, and the gizzard, which is a grinding organ. In fast-growing meat chickens, it takes less than three hours for feed to pass from mouth to cloaca and for nutrients to be digested and absorbed. To compensate for the relatively short digestive tract and rapid digesta transit time, high-performing birds need easily digested, nutrient-dense diets. Nutrient balance is critical. The rates of genetic change in growth and feed efficiency over the years have also changed the physiology of the birds. Nutrient requirements and nutritional management have there- fore changed to satisfy the genetic potential of the new strains. The high genetic potential of current poultry strains can only be achieved with properly formulated feeds that are protein- and en-ergy-dense. Poultry, especially growing birds, are unique among domestic animals in that any change in nutrition is reflected in bird performance almost immediately. This phenomenon has been successfully exploited by the commercial poultry industry to improve growth, carcass yield and egg production. The term \"poultry\" encompasses a range of domesticated spe- cies, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, game birds as quails and pheasants) and ratites (emus and ostriches). This overview does not discuss the nutrition of all these species, but focuses on chickens, which constitute more than 90 percent of the poultry market. However, the principles of nutritional man- agement for chickens are generally applicable to other poultry species grown for meat and eggs.61 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countriesPoultry require nutrients to maintain their current state (main- tenance) and to enable body growth (weight gain) or egg pro- duction. Birds need a steady supply of energy, protein, essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, minerals, vitamins and, most important, water. Poultry obtain energy and required nutrients through the digestion of natural feedstuffs, but minerals, vitamins and some key essential amino acids (lysine, methionine, threonine and tryptophan) are often offered as synthetic supplements. energy Poultry can derive energy from simple carbohydrates, fat and pro-tein. They cannot digest and utilize some complex carbohydrates, such as fibre, so feed formulation should use a system based on available energy. Metabolizable energy (ME) is the conventional measure of the available energy content of feed ingredients and the requirements of poultry. This takes account of energy losses in the faeces and urine.nutrient requirements For maximum growth and good health, intensively reared poul- try need a balanced array of nutrients in their diet. The nutrients required by birds vary according to species, age and the purpose of production - whether the birds are kept for meat or egg pro- duction. Table 1 provides a summary of recommended minimum levels of selected nutrients for meat chickens of different ages and for layers. To meet these specific needs, different classes of poultry have to be fed different types of diets. These recommen- dations should only be considered as guidelines and used as the basis for setting dietary nutrient concentrations in practical di-ets. Historically, recommendations on nutrient requirements have been based on available literature and data from expert groups. Currently, however, because each specific genotype has its own requirements, most commercial feed formulations use minimum requirements recommended by the breeding companies that sup- ply the chicks. meat chickens laying hens nutrient unit 0-3 weeks 3-6 weeks 6-8 weeks Metabolizable energy kcal/kg 3 200 3 3 200 2 900 MJ/kg 13.38 13.38 13.38 12.13 Crude protein % 23 20 18 15 Amino acids Arginine % 1.25 1.10 1.00 0.70 Glycine + Serine % 1.25 1.14 0.97 - Histidine % 0.35 0.32 0.27 0.17 Isoleucine % % 0.20 0.15 0.12 0.13 Non-phytate phosphorus % 0.45 0.35 0.30 0.25 Potassium % 0.30 0.30 0.30 0.15 Sodium % 0.20 0.15 0.12 0.15 Trace mineralsCopper mg 8 8 8 - Iodine mg 0.35 0.35 0.35 0.04 Iron mg 80 80 80 45 Manganese mg 60 60 60 20 Selenium mg 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.06 Zinc mg 40 40 40 35TABLE 1 Recommended minimum nutrient requirements of meat chickens and laying hens, as percentages or units per kilogram of diet (90 percent dry matter) Source: Adapted from National Research Council, 1994.62 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countriesBirds eat primarily to satisfy their energy needs, provided that the diet is adequate in all other essential nutrients. The energy level in the diet is therefore a major determinant of poultry's feed intake. When the dietary energy level changes, the feed intake will change, and the specifications for other nutrients must be modified to maintain the required intake. For this reason, the di- etary energy level is often used as the starting point in the formu- lation of practical diets for poultry. Different classes of poultry need different amounts of energy for metabolic purposes, and a deficiency will affect productive performance. To sustain high productivity, modern poultry strains are typically fed relatively high-energy diets. The dietary energy levels used in a given situation are largely dictated by the availabil- ity and cost of energy-rich feedstuffs. Because of the high cost of cereals, particularly maize, the use of low-energy diets for poultry feeding is not uncommon in many developing countries. Protein and amino acids The function of dietary protein is to supply amino acids for main- tenance, muscle growth and synthesis of egg protein. The syn- thesis of muscle and egg proteins requires a supply of 20 amino acids, all of which are physiological requirements. Ten of these are either not synthesized at all or are synthesized too slowly to meet the metabolic requirements, and are designated as essential elements of the diet. These need to be supplied in the diet. The balance can be synthesised from other amino acids; these are referred to as dietary non-essential elements and need not be considered in feed formulations. From a physiological point of view, however, all 20 amino acids are essential for the synthesis of various proteins in the body. The essential amino acids for poultry consider glycine to be essential for young birds. Cysteine and ty- rosine are considered semi-essential amino acids, because they can be synthesized from methionine and phenylalanine, respec- tively. Of the ten essential amino acids, lysine, methionine and threonine are the most limiting in most practical poultry diets. Poultry do not have a requirement for protein per se. However, an adequate dietary supply of nitrogen from protein is essential to synthesize non-essential amino acids. This ensures that the essen- tial amino acids are not used to supply the nitrogen for the syn- thesis of non-essential amino acids. Satisfying the recommended requirements for both protein and essential amino acids therefore ensures the provision of all amino acids to meet the birds' physi- ological needs. The amino acid requirements of poultry are influ- enced by several factors, including production level, genotype, sex, physiological status, environment and health status. For ex- ample, high levels of lean meat deposition require relatively high levels of lysine. High levels of egg output or feather growth re- quire relatively high levels of methionine. However, most changes in amino acid requirements do not lead to changes in the relative proportions of the different amino acids. There is therefore an ideal balance of dietary amino acids for poultry, and changes in amino acid requirements are normally expressed in relation to a balanced protein or ideal protein. fats and fatty acids Because of the greater energy density of fat compared with carbohydrates and protein, poultry diets usually include fats to achieve the needed dietary energy concentration. Fat accounts for about 3 to no more than 5 percent of most practical diets. Other benefits of using fats include better dust control in feed mills and poultry houses, and improved palatability of diets. Poul- try do not have a specific requirement for fats as a source of en- ergy, but a requirement for linoleic acid has been demonstrated. Linoleic acid is the only essential fatty acid needed by poultry, and its deficiency has rarely been observed in birds fed practical diets. Linoleic acid's main effect in laying birds is on egg size. minerals Minerals are needed for formation of the skeletal system, for gen- eral health, as components of general metabolic activity, and for maintenance of the body's acid-base balance. Calcium and phos- phorus are the most abundant mineral elements in the body, and are classified as macro-minerals, along with sodium, potassium, chloride, sulphur and magnesium. Macro-minerals are elements required in the diet at concentrations of more than 100 mg/kg. Calcium and phosphorus are necessary for the formation and maintenance of the skeletal structure and for good egg-shell quality. In general, 60 to 80 percent of total phosphorus present in plant-derived ingredients is in the form of phytate-phosphorus. Under normal dietary conditions, phytate phosphorus is poorly utilized by poultry owing to the lack of endogenous phytase in their digestive enzymes. It is generally assumed that about one- third of the phosphorus in plant feedstuffs is non-phytate and is biologically available to poultry, so the phosphorus requirement for poultry is expressed as non-phytate phosphorus, rather than total phosphorus. A ratio of 2:1 must be maintained between calcium and non-phytate phosphorus in growing birds' diets, to optimize the absorption of these two minerals. The ratio in lay- ing birds' diets is 13:1, because of the very high requirement for calcium for good shell quality. Dietary proportions of sodium (Na), potassium (K) and chlo- ride (Cl) largely determine the acid-base balance in the body for maintaining the physiological pH. If a shift occurs towards acid or base conditions, the metabolic processes are altered to main- tain the pH, with the likely result of depressed performance. The dietary electrolyte balance is described by the simple formula (Na + + K+ - Cl-) and expressed as mEq/kg diet. Prevention of elec- trolyte imbalance needs careful consideration, especially in hot climates. Under most conditions, a balance of about 250 mEq/ kg of diet appears satisfactory for optimum growth. The overall balance among these three minerals, and their individual concen- trations are important. To be effective, their dietary levels must each be within acceptable ranges, not deficient and not exces- sive. Birds exposed to heat stress consume more water, and are better able to withstand heat when the water contains electro- lytes. The replacement of part of the supplemental dietary sodium chloride with sodium bicarbonate has proved useful under these conditions. Trace elements, including copper, iodine, iron, manganese, se- lenium, zinc and cobalt, function as components of larger mole- cules and as co-factors of enzymes in various metabolic reactions. These are required in the diet in only very small amounts (Table 1). Practical poultry diets should be supplemented with these major and trace minerals, because typical cereal-based diets are defi-63 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countriescient in them. Organic forms of some trace minerals are currently available, and are generally considered to have higher biological availability than inorganic forms. vitamins Vitamins are classified as fat-soluble (vitamins A, D, E and K) and water-soluble (vitamin B complex and vitamin C). All vitamins, ex- cept for vitamin C, must be provided in the diet. Vitamin C is not generally classified as a dietary essential as it can be synthesized by the bird. However, under adverse circumstances such as heat stress, dietary supplementation of vitamin C may be beneficial. The metabolic roles of the vitamins are more complex than those of other nutrients. Vitamins are not simple body building units or energy sources, but are mediators of or participants in all bio- chemical pathways in the body. water Water is the most important, but most neglected nutrient in poul-try nutrition. Water has an impact on virtually every physiological function of the bird. A constant supply of water is important to: i) the digestion of feed; ii) the absorption of nutrients; iii) the excre- tion of waste products; and iv) the regulation of body tempera- ture. Water constitutes about 80 percent of the body. Unlike other animals, poultry eat and drink all the time. If they are deprived of water for even a short time, production and growth are irrevers- ibly affected. Water must therefore be made available at all times. Both feed intake and growth rate are highly correlated with water intake. Precise requirements for water are difficult to state, and are influenced by several factors, including ambient conditions, and the age and physiological status of the birds. Under most condi- tions, water intake is assumed to be twice the amount of feed intake. Drinking-water temperatures should be between 10 and 25 \u00b0C. Temperatures over 30 \u00b0C will reduce consumption. The quality of water is equally important. Quality is often taken for granted, but poor water quality can lead to poor productiv- ity and extensive economic losses. Water is an ideal medium for the distribution of contaminants, such as chemicals and minerals, and the proliferation of harmful microorganisms. Water quality for poultry can be a major issue in arid and semi-arid regions where water is scarce. In particular, underground water in these areas can have high levels of salt. Saline drinking-water contain- ing less than 0.25 percent salt is tolerated by birds, but can cause sodium toxicity if water intake is restricted. references Daghir, n.J. 1995.

Nutritional research in poultry has therefore centred on issues related to identifying barriers to effective di- gestion and utilization of nutrients, and on approaches for im- proving feed utilization. Poultry nutritionists have increasingly combined their expertise with that of specialists in other biologi- cal sciences, including immunology, microbiology, histology and molecular biology. Although broilers and layers are highly efficient in converting feed to food products, they still excrete significant amounts of unutilized nutrients. For example, in their manure, broilers lose almost 30 percent of ingested dry matter, 25 percent of gross energy, 50 percent of nitrogen, and 55 percent of phosphorus intake. There is therefore considerable room for improving the efficiency of feed conversion to animal products. Much of the inefficiency results from the presence of undesirable components and the indigestibility of nutrients in the feed. Recent advances in poultry nutrition have focussed on three main aspects: i) developing an understanding of nutrient metabolism and nutrient requirements; ii) determining the supply and availabil- ity of nutrients in feed ingredients; and iii) formulating least-cost diets that bring nutrient requirements and nutrient supply together effectively. The overall aim is precision feeding to lower costs and maximize economic efficiency. In the past, there was a tendency to overformulate diets when there was doubt about the availability of critical nutrients (especially amino acids and phosphorus) or when nutrient requirements were uncertain. This practice is no longer acceptable, not only because it is wasteful, but also because excess nutrients excreted in the manure are ultimately a source of pol- lution. Fine-tuning diets so that they more closely match the re- quirements of the birds, helps to optimize the efficiency of nutrient utilization. The major developments towards achieving the goal of precision feeding are discussed in the following sections. Defining nutrient requirements Defining nutrient needs is challenging because they are influenced by several factors and are subject to constant change. The factors influencing nutrient requirements are of two main types: bird- related ones, such as genetics, sex, and type and stage of produc- tion; and external ones, such as thermal environment, stress and husbandry conditions. Precision in defining requirements requires accuracy in both areas. Great advances in the definition of nutri- ent requirements for various classes of poultry have been made possible largely by the increasing uniformity of genotypes, hous- ing and husbandry practices throughout the poultry industry.Defining requirements for the ten essential amino acids has been made easier by acceptance of the ideal protein concept. As for other nutrients, the requirements for amino acids are in- fluenced by various factors, including genetics, sex, physiological status, environment and health status. However, most changes in amino acid requirements do not lead to changes in the relative proportion of the different amino acids. Thus actual changes in amino acid requirements can be expressed in relation to a bal- anced protein or ideal protein. The ideal protein concept uses ly-sine as the reference amino acid, and the requirements for other essential amino acids are set as percentages (or ratios) of the ly- sine requirement. Table 1 shows the ideal protein balances for meat chickens at different growth phases. The advantage of this system is that once the lysine requirements for a variety of condi- tions are determined, the needs for all other essential amino acids can be calculated. This approach has now become accepted prac- tice for setting the amino acid specifications of feed formulations in the poultry industry. Defining nutrient comPosition anD ingreDient quality Poultry producers are continually looking for opportunities that allow more flexibility in both the types and the levels of feed in- gredients for use in feed formulations. Such opportunities are becoming increasingly frequent because of advances in nutrient analysis and feed evaluation techniques. amino acid 1-21 days 22-42 days 43-56 days Lysine1100 100 100 Arginine 105 108 108 Histidine 35 35 35 Isoleucine 67 69 69 Leucine 109 109 109 Methionine + cysteine 72 72 72 Phenylalanine + tyrosine 105 105 105 Threonine 67 68.5 68.5 Tryptophan 16 17 17 Valine 77 80 80TABLE 1 Ideal amino acid ratios of meat chickens for three growth periods 1 Recommended digestible lysine requirements for meat chickens of 1 to 21, 22 to 42 and 43 to 56 days are 1.070, 0.865 and 0.745 percent, respectively.65 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countriesThe principal role of feed ingredients is to provide the nutrients that the bird digests and utilizes for productive functions. Cur - rently, considerable data are available on the ability of raw mate- rials to supply these nutrients. However, a degree of variability is inherent to each raw material, and this places pressure on precise feed formulations. Data on variation (or matrices) are available for the main feed ingredients and are applied in feed formulation programmes to achieve better precision. A related development is the availability of rapid tests, such as near-infrared reflectance analysis, to predict gross nutrient composition and assess the vari-ability in ingredient supplies on an ongoing basis. It is recognized that not all the nutrients in ingredients are avail- able for production purposes, and a portion of nutrients is ex- creted undigested or not utilized. As feed evaluation techniques develop, data have been accumulating on the availability of nu- trients for poultry, especially of amino acids and phosphorus. For example, a recent development has been the wider use of di- gestible amino acid concentrations, rather than total amino acid concentrations, in feed formulations. The use of digestible ami-no acid content is particularly relevant in developing countries, where highly digestible conventional ingredients are not available and diet formulations may include ingredients of low digestibility. Formulating diets based on digestible amino acids makes it pos- sible to increase the range of ingredients that can be used and the inclusion levels of alternative ingredients in poultry diets. This improves the precision of formulation, may lower feed costs, and ensures more predictable bird performance. better feeD formulation Once the nutritional needs are defined, the next step is to match these needs with combinations of ingredients and supplements. The object of formulation is to derive a balanced diet that pro- vides appropriate quantities of biologically available nutrients. For commercial producers, a further object is to formulate a balanced diet at least cost. Given the range of possible feedstuffs and nu- trients needed, a large number of arithmetical calculations are required to produce a least-cost diet. Over the years, feed formu- lation has evolved from a simple balancing of a few feedstuffs for a limited number of nutrients to a linear programming system that operates with the aid of computers. Systems using stochastic non-linear programming are now becoming popular, with com- mercially available formulation software. Variability in ingredient composition is non-linear, so stochastic programmes address this issue in the most cost-effective manner possible. A related development is the use of growth models to simulate feed intake and production parameters under given husbandry conditions. Such models are effective tools for: i) comparing ac- tual versus potential performance, which can indicate the extent of management or health problems in a flock; and ii) providing economic analysis of alternative feeding regimens. Several com- mercial growth models are available for predicting the production performance of both meat chickens and laying hens. However, because of the extreme complexity of biological responses, the models are only as good as the data used to establish them. There is a need for accurate and detailed information and data from a variety of production systems to enable the development of ro- bust models that can provide accurate prediction of performance.application aim(s) of the technology 1.

Biotechnologies have a vast range of applications in animal nutrition. Some of these are already in use (Table 2), while others are known to have potential but are not yet commercially applied because of techni- cal limitations and public concerns (Table 3). feeD Processing Today, after their ingredients have been mixed, most poultry feeds undergo some form of processing, which involves a wide range of thermal treatments including extrusion, expansion, conditioning and pelleting. Most of the feed used in the production of meat chickens is fed in pelleted or crumbled form, which enhances the economics of production by improving feed efficiency and growth performance. These improvements are attributed to de- creased feed wastage, higher nutrient density, reduced selective feeding, decreased time and energy spent on eating, destruction of pathogenic organisms, and thermal modification of starch and protein. Introduction of pellet feeds is a notable feature in coun- tries seeking to improve the production efficiency of the poultry sector. PHase feeDing The current recommendations for poultry list the nutrient require-ments for only selected growth periods; the three periods of up to three weeks, three to six weeks, and six to eight weeks are con-66 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countriessidered for meat chickens. In practice, however, grow-out periods can range from four to ten weeks of age, depending on local market needs. Recognizing that changes in nutrient needs are more dynamic than these general recommendations, the com- mercial poultry industry is increasingly using phase-feeding sys- tems to maximize performance and increase profit margins. Di- etary protein and amino acid specifications are usually decreased in a progression of different feeds that satisfy changing require- ments and economics. Typical feeding programmes over a five- to seven-week production cycle now include four to five feeds, such as pre-starter, starter, grower and finisher; or pre-starter, starter, grower, finisher and withdrawal. The withdrawal diets often fed during the last seven to ten days of growth involve removal of certain pharmaceutical additives and reduction of protein/amino acids. In recent years, they have also involved the reduction of certain vitamins and trace minerals, and energy. wHole grain feeDing Another recent development has been the feeding of whole grains (wheat or barley) along with a balanced concentrate feed. The benefits of whole grain feeding include better performance, reduced feed processing costs and improved flock health. These benefits appear to arise from a combination of two physiological actions: physical benefits of gizzard development and increased proventriculus secretions; and better matching of daily require- ments through self-selection by the bird. The usual method of whole grain feeding is to blend 10 to 25 percent of the weight of the feed on top of the feed in delivery trucks or at the poultry house. sustainable Poultry feeDing Not long ago, the main objective of formulating feeds was to supply nutrients (nutrient input). Today there is much public con- cern about what comes out of the bird (nutrient output). Animal agriculture, including the commercial poultry sector, is clearly re- leasing excess nutrients into the environment, and must assume responsibility for its impact on the environment, especially on wa- ter quality. Without question, the poultry industry must achieve the goal of sustainability, as environmental concerns have a major influence on its future growth and expansion. From a nutrition point of view, the most obvious strategy is to feed birds to match their requirements (precision feeding) and to improve the effi- ciency of birds' nutrient utilization, which will reduce the nutrient load in manure. references leeson, s. & summers, J.D. 2005.

Of total feed cost, about 95 percent is used to meet energy and protein requirements, about 3 to 4 percent for major mineral, trace mineral and vitamin require- ments, and 1 to 2 percent for various feed additives. Poultry diets are formulated from a mixture of ingredients, including cereal grains, cereal by-products, fats, plant protein sources, animal by- products, vitamin and mineral supplements, crystalline amino ac- ids and feed additives. These are assembled on a least-cost basis, taking into consideration their nutrient contents as well as their unit prices. Table 1 shows common ingredients used in poultry feed formulations in most parts of the world. main ingreDients: availability issues Energy sources constitute the largest component of poultry di- ets, followed by plant protein sources and animal protein sources. Globally, maize (corn) is the most commonly used energy source, and soybean meal is a common plant protein source. However, other grains such as wheat and sorghum, and plant protein meals such as canola meal, peas and sunflower meal are also widely used in some countries. The main animal protein ingredients are fishmeal and meat meal. Almost all developing countries are net importers of these ingredients; the poultry feed industries in Afri- ca and Asia depend on imports, which are a drain on their foreign exchange reserves. Quite often, the semi-commercial and com- mercial sectors in these countries are forced to limit their output of compounded feeds. The diversion of grains, particularly maize, from the animal feed market to ethanol production is a major recent development that has caused severe grain supply problems in the world mar - ket, with dramatic price increases. With government policies to promote the use of biofuels, the global production of ethanol has rapidly increased in recent years, and further large increases are expected in the future. Despite record prices, the import de- mand for main ingredients in developing countries continues to increase to meet the feed demands of an expanding poultry sec- tor, putting further pressure on prices. Paradoxically, the solution for the rocketing price of maize could come from the biofuel in- dustry, through its major co-product - distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS) - which has been shown to be a good source of available amino acids and energy. Worldwide, feed millers are showing keen interest in DDGS because of its cost-effectiveness and ready availability. Good-quality DDGS is a potentially useful feed ingredient, containing about 25 percent protein and 10 per - cent fat, and rich mineral and vitamin resources. The amino acid availability in DDGS is similar to that in soybean meal. This may be the only raw material whose supply is assured and will increase in the future. main energy source The predominant feedgrain used in poultry feeds worldwide is maize. This is mainly because its energy source is starch, which is highly digestible for poultry. In addition, it is highly palatable, is a high-density source of readily available energy, and is free of anti-nutritional factors. The metabolizable energy value of maize is generally considered the standard with which other energy sources are compared. In North America and Brazil, the feed industry has benefited from surplus maize, resulting from increased mechanization and the application of genetic and agronomic techniques to raise pro-ductivity. In the Asian and African regions, however, maize yield per hectare is low, and in most countries, production has never been sufficient to meet the needs of the growing human popula- tion. The net result is a continuing shortage of maize for feed use in these regions. The other energy source that meets most of the same criteria as maize is low-tannin sorghum. Sorghum can be grown in low-rain- fall areas and is a popular crop in hot, drought-prone regions. The high tannin content of many older sorghum varieties limits their use in poultry diets, but low-tannin varieties are now available and can be used in poultry diets without any limitation. The energy value of low-tannin sorghum is 90 to 95 percent that of maize.1. Energy sources: - cereals (mainly maize),1 cereal by-products - animal fats and vegetable oils 2.

Plant protein sources supply the major portion of dietary protein (or nitrogen) require- ments. The plant protein source traditionally used for feed manu- facture is soybean meal, which is the preferred source for poultry feed. Soybean meal contains 40 to 48 percent crude protein, de- pending on the amount of hulls removed and the oil extraction procedure. Relative to other oilseed meals, soybean protein has a good balance of essential amino acids, which can complement most cereal-based diets. The amino acid availability in soybean meal is higher than those for other oilseed meals. The metabo- lizable energy content is also substantially higher than in other oilseed meals. Raw soybeans contain several anti-nutritional factors, including protease inhibitors, which can negatively affect protein digestion and bird performance. However, these inhibitors are destroyed by heat during the processing of soybean meal. Properly processed soybean meal is an excellent protein source for all classes of poul-try, with no restrictions on its use. Soybean production has increased substantially over the past two decades to meet the rising demands for oil for the human food market and meal for the animal feed market. The major pro- ducers of soybeans are the United States, Brazil and Argentina, which are also the major exporters. More than 50 percent of the current crop is now genetically modified (GM), mainly for herbi- cide tolerance, and there is an ongoing debate and campaign to reject GM ingredients from animal diets. If GM sources are not accepted in the market place, the potential for further nutritional quality enhancement and increased productivity will be limited. main animal Protein sources With the notable exception of soybean meal, plant protein sourc- es are generally nutritionally imbalanced in terms of essential ami- no acids, particularly lysine, the first limiting amino acid in cereals. Unless supplemented with animal protein sources and crystalline amino acids, plant-based diets may not meet the requirements for critical amino acids for egg and meat production. Owing to their high prices, animal protein ingredients are normally used to balance the amino acid contents of diets rather than as major sources of protein. In many countries, feed manufacturers ensure that animal protein ingredients do not fall below minimum levels in poultry diets, especially for young birds whose amino acid re- quirements are high. The requirements for essential amino acids are progressively reduced as the birds grow older, and it is pos- sible to meet the needs of older birds with diets containing lower levels of animal protein and relatively higher levels of plant pro- tein. Fishmeal and meat meal are the animal protein sources most widely used in poultry diets fisHmeal Fishmeal is an exceptionally good source of high-quality pro-tein, and its price usually reflects this. It also provides abundant amounts of minerals (calcium, phosphorus and trace minerals), B vitamins and essential fatty acids. The presence of unidentified growth factors is another feature of fishmeal. Feed formulations therefore seek to ensure minimum levels of fishmeal in diets.Fishmeal consists essentially of dried, ground carcasses of fish. Good-quality fishmeal is brown, but the colour varies according to the type of fish used and the processing conditions. A very dark colour is indicative of overheating, which can destroy amino acids, reduce amino acid availability and substantially lower the protein quality. Fishmeal is an important - sometimes the only - source of ani- mal protein ingredients in most developing countries. It is either imported or locally produced. Local fishmeals typically contain between 40 and 50 percent crude protein, compared with more than 60 percent protein in imported fishmeals. Local fishmeals are generally of low quality owing to lack of control over raw fish quality, processing and storage conditions. They are often adul- terated with cheap diluents, including poor-quality protein sourc- poultry manure, oilseed meals), urea and non-nutritive diluents such as sand. Some fishmeals may be objectionable be- cause of putrefaction, impurities or excessive salt content. Sam-ples containing as much as 15 percent salt are not uncommon. This situation underlines the lack of quality control measures in most developing countries. As salt has laxative and growth de- pressing effects, the salt content of fishmeals should be carefully monitored; it should be less than 3 percent for best results, but legally may be up to 7 percent. The correct quantity of fishmeal to include depends on the types of cereal and oilseed meals in the feed formulation. The cost of fishmeal is another important determinant. In general, av-erage inclusion levels may be up to 8 percent for young birds, and less than 4 percent for older meat birds and layers. Higher levels must be avoided in finishing and laying diets, as they may lend a fishy taint to meat and eggs. Use of fishmeal can compensate, to an extent, where husbandry conditions are less than ideal. Future expansion possibilities in fishmeal production are lim- ited. Production does not seem to have increased over the past 20 years, and is unlikely to do so in the future, given the pressures on world fisheries. Fishmeal is included in the overall animal protein ban in Europe, and there is also an underlying concern about pos- sible pollutant (e.g., dioxin) levels in fishmeal. meat meal Meat meal contains relatively high levels of protein, calcium and available phosphorus. Meat meal is the dry-rendered product from mammalian tissues, excluding hair, hooves, horns, hide trimmings, blood and stomach contents, except in such amounts as occur in good slaughterhouse practice. Meat meals are de- rived mainly from bones and associated tissues such as tendons, ligaments, some skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal tract, lungs and condemned livers. Variation in the proportions of these raw ma- terials contributes to the large variations in meat meal quality. Depending on the proportion of bone to soft tissue used in the manufacture, the finished product is designated as meat meal (containing more than 55 percent crude protein and less than 4.4 percent phosphorus) or meat and bone meal (containing less than 55 percent crude protein and more than 4.4 percent phos- phorus). Collagen is the major protein in bone, connective tissue, car - tilage and tendon, and contains no tryptophan. In poor-quality meat meals, 50 to 65 percent of total protein may be collagen. In- creasing the level of bone in meat meal lowers the nutritive value, 69 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countriesand the quality of its protein may vary greatly in terms of amino acid composition and digestibility. Protein quality is also affected by the temperature used to process the meat meal. As a supplement to cereal-based diets, meat meal is of lower quality than fishmeal or soybean meal. Tryptophan is the first lim- iting amino acid in meat meal for poultry fed maize-based di- ets; lysine and methionine are also limiting. Normally, no more than 10 percent meat and bone meal is recommended for use in poultry diets, largely because phosphorus requirements are met at that level. In recent years, feed manufacturers have to cope with increas- ing safety concerns, exemplified by the bovine spongiform en-cephalopathy (BSE) crisis, associated with the feeding of meat meal to ruminant animals. The use of meat meal in animal feed manufacture is now banned in some parts of the world, and the long-term future of this raw material seems uncertain.references ensminger, m.e., oldfield, J.e. & Heinemann, w .w. 1990.

In addition to energy and protein, formulations contain supplements to provide minerals, vitamins and specific amino acids. These supplements must be added to all diets as they provide essential nutrients necessary for health and performance. Modern feed formulations also contain a diverse range of non-nutritive additives, which may not be essential but have an important bearing on performance and health. In many cases, the need for their inclusion is well understood: A major fac- tor to be considered in selecting these additives is their efficacy. Feed supplements and additives are used in only small quantities, and it is particularly important that they are mixed carefully with the main ingredients so that they are evenly distributed. nutritional suPPlements useD in Poultry feeD formulations mineral supplements Only part of birds' mineral requirements is provided by the natural feedstuffs in their diets. Mineral supplements must therefore be included in feed formulations. Major minerals: Poultry require relatively large amounts of some minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus and sodium. Calcium and phosphorus are needed for normal growth and skeletal develop- ment, and poultry have unusually high requirements for calcium during the period of egg production, for the formation of strong egg shells. The calcium supplements commonly used in poultry feeding are limestone, crushed sea shells or sea-shell flour. Lime- stone powder can be included at no more than 3 percent, be- cause higher levels will lower feed intake. It is therefore necessary to provide the extra calcium needed by high-producing layers as shell grit or limestone grit. To meet the phosphorus needs of poultry, formulations must be supplemented with inorganic phosphorus sources. In diets containing fishmeal and meat and bone meal, supplementa- tion with inorganic sources may not be necessary. The inorganic phosphates used in poultry diets are dicalcium phosphate, bone meal, rock phosphate, defluorinated phosphate and tricalcium phosphate, all of which supply both calcium and phosphorus. It is important that the inorganic phosphates are obtained from reli- able sources, as contamination with fluorine can be a problem in some regions. Excess levels of fluorine in the phosphate source can adversely affect bird performance.A recent development in phosphorus nutrition has been the availability of commercial phytase enzymes, which assist the bird's digestion and utilization of the phosphorus bound in phytic acid. This enzyme improves the availability of phosphorus from plant materials and reduces the need for inorganic phosphates in feed formulations. This enzyme is a non-nutritive additive. Common salt is included in all diets as a source of sodium and an appetite stimulant. Salt is added in poultry diets at levels of 0.2 to 0.4 percent. Excessive salt increases water consumption and leads to wet excreta. The use of salt can be lowered or even omit- ted if more than 5 percent fishmeal is used in the diet. Most formulations also contain 0.2 to 0.3 percent sodium bi- carbonate (common baking soda); inclusion of this substance is particularly important in hot climates. When environmental tem- peratures are high, birds increase their respiration rate to increase the rate of evaporative cooling, thereby losing excessive amounts of carbon dioxide. This may be reflected in reduced growth rate and a decline in egg-shell quality, often seen in high-producing layers. Under these conditions, the replacement of part of the supplemental salt with sodium bicarbonate is recommended. Trace minerals: These elements are required in the diet at con- centrations in trace amounts, usually about 0.01 percent. Trace minerals (zinc, copper, iron, manganese, cobalt, selenium) are therefore usually added in the form of propriety premixes. vitamin supplements All vitamins, except vitamin C, must be provided in the diet. Vi- tamins are required in only small amounts, and are usually pro- vided in propriety vitamin premixes, which can be purchased from commercial suppliers. Although vitamin premixes represent only 0.05 percent of the diet, they can have a large effect on bird performance. crystalline amino acids Pure forms of individual amino acids are now commercially avail-able. Currently the limiting amino acids in poultry diets - me- thionine, lysine, threonine and tryptophan (in that order) - can be purchased at reasonable cost and included in poultry diets to balance dietary amino acid levels. Amino acid supplements now play a very important role in improving protein utilization in ani- mal feeding.71 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countriesnon-nutritive aDDitives useD in Poultry feeD formulations Poultry formulations also contain an array of substances known as \"feed additives\". These are non-nutritive substances usually added in amounts of less than 0.05 percent to maintain health status, uniformity and production efficiency in intensive produc- tion systems. These additives have now become vital components of practical diets. Table 1 presents a list of commonly used feed additives. Two recent developments relating to feed additives deserve special mention. First, there is increased interest in the use of feed enzymes to improve the utilization of nutrients in raw materials and to reduce feed cost. Improvements in nutrient availability are achieved by one or more of the following mechanisms: i) degra- dation of specific bonds in ingredients not usually degraded by endogenous digestive enzymes; ii) degradation of anti-nutritive factors that lower the availability of nutrients; iii) increased ac- cessibility of nutrients to endogenous digestive enzymes; and iv) supplementation of the enzyme capacity of young animals. En- zymes widely used in the poultry industry are the carbohydrases that cleave the viscous fibre components in cereals (Table 1) and phytases that target the phytic acid-complexes in plant ingredi- ents. More recently, technically successful enzyme preparations for use in maize-soybean diets have become available. Future ad- vances in feed enzyme technology will involve the development of enzymes that can be used to target the anti-nutritive factors in non-traditional feedstuffs and improve their feeding value. The second development is the recent ban on the use of in-feed antibiotics in animal feeds in some countries. In other countries, the number of in-feed antibiotics available for use in poultry diets has been restricted. Antibiotics have been used in poultry diets for many years as protection against pathogens and sub-clinical diseases, and for the resulting improved growth.

Much of the increase in global demand for poultry products will be in developing countries. Such growth in the poultry industry is having a profound effect on the demand for feed and raw materials. However, it is also becoming clear that the requirements for the four traditional feed ingredients - maize, soybean meal, fishmeal and meat meal - cannot be met, even according to optimistic forecasts. The gap between local supply and demand for these traditional ingredients is expected to widen over the coming decades, providing a compelling reason for exploring the usefulness of locally available, alternative feed- stuffs in feed formulations. A wide range of alternative feedstuffs are available for feeding in all three poultry production systems. The greatest potential for efficiently utilizing these feedstuffs will be in traditional family poultry systems (scavenging and backyard) and the semi-com- mercial system. In the semi-commercial system, only part of the feed requirement is purchased from commercial compounders, so there is opportunity for on-farm mixing or dilution of purchased feeds with locally available, alternative feedstuffs. In low-input family poultry systems, locally available, alternative feedstuffs can be used to supplement the scavenging feed base. non-traDitional feeDstuffs - tHe issues Alternative feedstuffs are often referred as \"non-traditional feed-stuffs\" because they have not traditionally been used in animal feeding or are not normally used in commercial animal diets. However, it is difficult to draw a clear distinction between tradi- tional and non-traditional feeds. Feedstuffs that may be classified as non-traditional in some regions, may actually be traditional and based on many years of usage in others. Some feedstuffs may have started as non-traditional, but are now being used in- creasingly in commercial diets. A good example is palm kernel meal, which is a non-traditional feedstuff in Western Africa, but an increasingly normal feedstuff for feed millers in Southeast Asia, especially in pullet and layer diets. It is widely recognized that in developing African and Asian countries, existing feed resources in many circumstances are ei-ther unutilized and wasted or used inefficiently. Most of these alternative feedstuffs have obvious potential, but their use has been negligible owing to constraints imposed by nutritional, tech- nical and socio-economic factors (Table 1). Three major criteria determine the regular use of a feedstuff in commercial diets: i) it must be available in economic quantities, even if its availability is seasonal; ii) the price must be competitive against the main feed-stuffs; and iii) its nutritive value must be understood, including its nutrient content, existing variation and nutrient digestibility. In many developing countries, in may be difficult to assess the nutritive value of any feedstuff, owing to the lack or scarcity of appropriate research or analytical facilities. This is a major factor discouraging commercial feed mills from considering the use of alternative ingredients. There has been keen interest in evaluating alternative feed re- sources over the years, and a proliferation of published data, es- pecially from developing countries. Lists of alternative feedstuffs that seem to have the greatest potential as substitutes for maize, soybean meal and animal proteins are presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4, respectively. These lists are by no means exhaustive; this in- formation note does not aim to review all the available literature on each individual ingredient, but rather to identify the general issues limiting their use and maximum inclusion levels in com-mercial poultry diets. future ProsPects for alternative feeDstuffs The immediate prospects for the use of alternative feedstuffs listed in Tables 2, 3 and 4 will be in semi-commercial poultry units that employ some degree of on-farm feed mixing, and family poultry units. In these sectors, where the objective is economic Nutritional aspects - Variability (or lack of consistency) in nutrient quality - Limited information on the availability of nutrients - High fibre content - Presence of anti-nutritional factor(s) - Need for nutrient supplementation (added cost) Technical aspects - Seasonal and unreliable supply - Bulkiness, physical characteristics - Need for de-hulling and/or processing (drying, detoxification) - Limited research and development facilities for determining nutrient composition and inclusion levels in poultry diets Socio-economic aspects - Competition with use as human food - Poor prices relative to other arable crops (farmer) - Cost per unit of energy or limiting amino acids, relative to traditional feedstuffs (feed manufacturer) - Cost of processingTABLE 1 Factors limiting the use of alternative feed ingredients in poultry feed formulations73 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countriesfeedstuff comments Cereals Wheat Can be used when cost-competitive Limitation: high non-starch polysaccharide contents result in intestinal digesta problems;

Suggested inclusion levels are for nutri-tionally balanced diets. 2 A range of grain legumes are grown in developing countries. Only selected species are identified here. It must be noted that all raw legumes contain a number of anti-nutritive factors, but most of these can be eliminated by processing. productivity rather than maximum biological productivity, alterna- tive feedstuffs can make a useful contribution to poultry feeding. Before the use of these feedstuffs can be considered in the modern commercial poultry sector, most - if not all - of the limi- tations identified in Tables 2, 3 and 4 must be resolved. A number of other possibilities are available for improving the feeding value and increasing the inclusion levels of many of these alternative feedstuffs: i) formulation of diets based on digestible amino acids, rather than total amino acids; ii) use of crystalline amino acids to balance amino acid specifications; and iii) supplementation with commercial exogenous enzymes to improve nutrient and energy 74 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countriesavailability. The effect of supplemental enzymes on alternative feedstuffs is twofold: first, they eliminate or reduce the action of anti-nutritive factors; and second, they increase digestibility and improve nutritive value The greatest potential for using alternative feedstuffs is in the feeding of layers, irrespective of the production system. Owing to physiological differences, pullets and layers are more tolerant to high fibre, poor-quality feedstuffs and nutritional challenges than fast-growing meat birds are. Some of these feedstuffs can be included at high levels, but have negative effects on egg pro-duction. Rice bran and palm kernel meal are good examples of this tolerance; both can be used at maximum levels of only 10 percent in broiler diets, but may be safely incorporated into pullet and layer diets at levels of up to 30 percent. suPPlementary feeDing strategies for family Poultry The scavenging area for family poultry is usually limited and often over-scavenged. The quantity and quality of the feed base for family poultry are also very variable, depending particularly on the season, but also on rainfall and agricultural activities. The supply of protein, minerals and vitamins is often high during the rainy season, owing to the abundance of insects and green materials, but becomes critical during the dry season. On the other hand, most of the materials available are deficient in energy through- out most of the year, because the feed base is generally high in fibre. Overall, feed consumed by family poultry can be con-sidered deficient in all major nutrients - energy, protein, calcium and phosphorus. It is therefore recognized that scavenging alone will not provide enough feed to support the needs for growth or egg production, and that body weights and egg numbers can be markedly improved by the provision of supplementary feed. Small amounts of strategically administered supplements are likely to increase production and minimize mortality. Several of the alter - native feedstuffs identified in this information note can play an important role as supplementary feeds.Unlike the intensive poultry production system, the family poul- try system lends itself well to the inclusion of locally available, alternative feedstuffs. Most of these feedstuffs are available only seasonally, in limited quantities and in specific locations, but can easily be accommodated within the family poultry system. Many of these materials are dusty in nature, and could be wasted if of- fered in dry form. To avoid wastage, these materials are therefore best offered as wet mash. energy supplements The main feature of the traditional poultry system is that it does not directly compete with humans for the same food. However, where possible, it is advisable to offer small amounts of grains such as millets, maize and sorghum as energy supplements. At- tention must therefore be paid to available cereal by-products. In most households and locations, several by-products from cereal milling are available for animal feeding, including bran, hulls and screenings. Despite their high fibre contents, these can be valu- able sources of energy. Small and damaged tubers and roots of cassava, sweet pota- toes and yams, which are unfit for human consumption, are avail-able in many areas and could be processed into a high-energy animal feed. The most practical method is to slice, sun-dry and pound or grind them into a meal. Cassava peels (which constitute 10 percent of the tuber weight) are not used for human con- sumption, and represent an economical feed for family poultry. However, they contain high levels of cyanide and must be pro- cessed to eliminate this toxic factor prior to feeding; simple sun- drying is adequate for this. Residues from the production of fer - mented cassava products can also be useful energy supplements. A number of locally available fruit by-products can be used to provide energy. A good example is banana peels, which can be collected from local markets, sun-dried and milled into a meal. Proper drying is important to avoid spoilage and bacterial growth. A similar meal can be prepared from mango seed kernel, which has to be boiled prior to drying. On their own, both these meals have poor palatability and have to be offered in a mixture with other feedstuffs. In areas where breweries or fruit processing operations are lo- cated, by-products may be collected and offered to poultry in wet form. These materials are good sources of supplemental energy. Protein supplements green materialsGreen materials are the cheapest sources of protein available to family poultry. A wide range of materials are available, including herbs, fodder leaves (e.g., leucaena, calliandra, sesbania), leaves from cultivated plants (e.g., cassava) and aquatic plants (e.g., azolla, water hyacinth, duckweed). These can be grown in small plots around the household. Where lagoons are available, the cultivation of aquatic plants should be promoted. The advantage of green materials is their high dry matter yields, which can be harvested and fed directly to poultry in fresh form. Not only are these materials good sources of protein, but they are also rich in pigments, vitamins and minerals. industrial by-products By-products from local industries such as oil mills (palm kernel feedstuff comments Dried fish silage A way of turning waste fish into quality animal protein supplement; can completely replace fishmeal Limitation: requires drying Blood meal High protein content Limitations: extremely deficient in isoleucine, poor palatability; can be included at no more than 5% Hydrolysed feather meal High protein content Limitations: deficient in several essential amino acids, low availability of amino acids; can be included at no more than 5% Poultry by-product meal Feeding value similar to that of meat meal; recommended inclusion level of 5% Skimmed milk powder Reject milk powder; good-quality protein; can be included at up to 5% sources: insects, fly larvae, earthworms, termites, bees, snails, protein sources; can replace 50% of fishmeal in formulations; useful supplements for family poultry Limitation: no commercial production and harvesting systemsTABLE 4 Alternative animal protein sources for use in poultry diets75 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countriesmeal, sesame meal, coconut meal, rubber seed meal) and fibres (cotton, kapok) represent good sources of protein. Some of these materials are already used to supplement the feeding of family poultry. animal and fish by-products In areas where there are fishing and meat processing operations, there is good potential for using offal for poultry feeding, in ei- ther fresh form or after processing. For example, the edible flesh of most types of fish represents only 40 percent of their total weight, leaving 60 percent for use as a protein feed resource. Scrap fish and fish wastes or residues (heads and offal) can be dried and processed into a meal, or be preserved as silage. The technique for making fish silage is simple, but the producer re- quires training. meals from insects Insects can be used to produce cheaper proteins from non-food animals. Insects are part of the natural diet of poultry, and scav-enging poultry consume a wide variety, including grasshoppers, crickets, termites, aphids, scale insects, beetles, caterpillars, pupa, flies, fleas, bees, wasps and ants. Insects are rich in protein, with reported protein contents ranging from 40 to 75 percent. These novel protein sources can be collected from surrounding areas. There is also opportunity for the production of insects using waste materials. Insect larva: The biological digestion of animal wastes by the larval stage of flies (especially house and soldier flies), and the harvest and use of larvae and pupae is a cheap way of supplying high-protein materials to family poultry. Insect larva can be pro- duced from kitchen and animal wastes. The materials are left to decompose in a protected area, where insects come and lay their eggs. Guidelines on the medium- to large-scale production of fly pupae using animal wastes describe how light is used to induce the migration of larvae out of the waste, through a screen and into a lower compartment, where they pupate and are harvested. Termites: Termites are not only collected from nature, but can also be grown near the family unit and harvested. Termites have a unique ability to digest fibre, and the production of termites should be linked to the recycling of wood and paper wastes. A simple method of rearing termites on crop residues for family poultry supplementation is practised in some African countries. This involves the use of inverted clay pots containing termites and filled with moistened fibrous material. The pots must be protect-ed against excessive heat and desiccation, and the termite larvae can be harvested after three to four weeks. meals from small animals Earthworms: Earthworms are a natural food source for poultry kept under free-range systems and, live or dried, are highly palat- able to poultry. Worm cultivation for fishing is common in many countries. Earthworms can also easily be produced and harvested for feeding family poultry, based on the biodegradation of animal manure. Techniques for the culture of earthworms (referred to as vermiculture) are well established and can be modified to suit small-scale production systems. Successful culture of earthworms requires: i) a food source; ii) adequate moisture (more than 50 percent water content); iii) adequate aeration; and iv) protection from excessive heat. A kilogram of earthworms consumes and digests 0.5 to 1.0 kg of waste a day. Because worms are top feeders, most of them will be found in the top 10 to 20 cm of the manure and can easily be harvested. Alternatively, the chickens can be let into the area to harvest the worms themselves. Under suitable growing conditions, up to 30 000 worms per square me- tre of surface area may be harvested. Snails: The African giant snail is a major garden pest, which is particularly abundant during the wet season. The collection and use of snails as animal feed is therefore also of interest in the con- text of pest control. The bodies of snails contain hydrocyanic acid, presumably accumulated from the ingestion of cyanide-contain- ing materials, but this toxic factor can be completely eliminated by cooking. mineral and vitamin supplements Scavenging birds have far greater opportunity to balance their own micronutrient requirements. In the scavenging situation, minerals and vitamins are often provided from organic and non- organic materials pecked from the environment by the birds. Important sources of minerals and vitamins include snail shells, insects, fruits and fresh green materials. references el boushy, a.r.y . & van der Poel, a.f .b. 1994.

Animal feeds are routinely subject to contamination from diverse sources, which may have serious consequences on the safety of foods of animal origin. Public concerns over food safety have heightened in recent years, because of problems such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), melamine and dioxin con- taminations, outbreaks of food-borne bacterial infections, and potential microbial resistance to antibiotics. Given the direct links between feed safety and the safety of foods of animal origin, it is essential that feed production and manufacture procedures meet stringent safety requirements. Some sources of feed contamination are high priorities in all production systems and countries: i) mycotoxins (or fungal tox- ins); ii) pathogenic biological agents; and iii) various chemicals. These agents may contaminate feed at any stage of production up to the point of feeding, and can result in hazards in food of animal origin. Biological agents and chemicals normally enter the feed supply under specific conditions. Mycotoxins are more wide- spread, however, particularly in developing countries, because of improper agricultural, storage and processing practices. Not only do mycotoxins represent a food safety issue, but they can also have serious consequences on poultry performance, and so are discussed in some detail in this information note. Disease-causing biological agents Poultry feed may be the source of human illness resulting from the consumption of poultry products. The agent of major con- cern in poultry feeds is salmonella, which is associated with food poisoning in humans. The principal manifestation of human sal- monellosis is gastroenteritis. Salmonella is widely distributed in nature, and animal feed is only one of many sources for farm animals. Feedstuffs of animal origin are particularly frequently contaminated with salmonella. Salmonella contamination can be avoided by sourcing and us- ing salmonella-negative feedstuffs in diet formulation. Heat treat-ments of varying severity are commonly used to ensure the micro- biological quality of animal feed. cHemical contamination A wide range of chemicals can enter the feed production system, intentionally or unintentionally. Potential hazards include veteri- nary drugs, agricultural chemicals (e.g., pesticides, fungicides), in- dustrial chemicals (e.g., dioxin), heavy metals (e.g., mercury, lead, cadmium) and adulterants (e.g., melamine). These chemicals can accumulate in animal tissues, or are excreted in milk or incorpo- rated in eggs, and cause health problems in humans. Some veterinary drugs, such as antibiotics and coccidiostats, are routinely included in poultry feeds as additives. In meat-pro-ducing birds, the problem of drug residues in meat are overcome by providing a withdrawal diet containing no drugs for seven to ten days prior to slaughter. However, the possible development of microbial resistance due to the use of antimicrobials in animal diets has become a major public concern in recent years. As a result, the use of in-feed antibiotics is either banned or restricted in the poultry industries of developed countries. Most other chemical contaminants enter feeds through plant materials, especially cereals and treated seeds. The levels of chemicals in plant materials are closely related to the levels of soil contaminants where they are grown. Similarly, animal fats used in formulations may contain high levels of lipid-soluble contami- nants if they are produced from feed grown in polluted areas mycotoxins The term \"mycotoxin\" refers to all toxins produced by various types of fungus when they grow on agricultural products before or after harvest or during transportation or storage. The most commonly affected feedstuffs are cereals, oilseeds and oilseed meals. These toxins have the capacity not only to impair bird performance, but also to affect humans through toxin residues that can be deposited in animal tissues. Many mycotoxins with different chemical structures and biological activities have been identified. Table 1 presents a list of major mycotoxins of economic importance in poultry feeds. When environmental conditions are conducive to fungal growth, mycotoxin contamination of grains may start in the field, and can also take place during processing and storage of har - mycotoxin fungal Origins of major mycotoxins found in common feedstuffs77 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countrieswith Fusarium mycotoxins all over the world. The majority of Fusarium fungi have the ability to produce toxins. Of particular importance are the trichothecenes, zearalenone (ZEN) and the fumonisins. The trichothecenes include and deoxyniva- lenol (DON; also known as vomitoxin). In addition, a given species can produce several different toxins, and grain crops are often contaminated by several Fusarium species at the same time. Thus, several toxins may be present simultaneously in contaminated feeds. metHoDs of controlling or Decontaminating mycotoxins Mycotoxins are regularly found in feed ingredients such as maize, sorghum, barley, wheat, rice meal, cottonseed meal, groundnuts and other legumes. In general, mycotoxins are relatively stable compounds that are not destroyed by processing of feed, and may even be concentrated by screening. Feeds contaminated with mycotoxins in excess of established levels should not be fed to animals producing eggs or meat for human consumption. It is not easy to prevent mycotoxins in the environment. Pre- vention of the contamination of agricultural commodities by fungi and their mycotoxins can be divided into the following three levels. Primary prevention The best pre- or post-harvest strategy to use in a particular year depends on the climatic conditions of that year. Unfortunately, avoiding weather that favours fungal infection is beyond human control. Nonetheless, understanding the environmental factors that promote infection, growth and toxin production is the first step in minimizing mycotoxins in feeds. Several practices may help to maintain conditions that are unfavourable for fungal growth: i) development of fungal-resistant crop varieties; ii) control of on- field infection with fungicides; iii) scheduling of harvests in the period suitable for the region; and iv) lowering the moisture con-tent of the feedstuff after harvest and during storage. secondary prevention This level of prevention is required when the fungi are already in the feedstuff. The fungi should be eliminated or their growth stopped to prevent further deterioration and mycotoxin contami- nation. The following measures may be useful: i) protecting stored products from conditions that favour continuing fungal growth; ii) using mould inhibitors (such as organic acids) against fungal growth; iii) storing commodity at low temperatures, where eco- nomically possible; iv) stopping the growth of infested fungi by re-drying the products; and v) removing contaminated material. tertiary prevention When the product is heavily infested by toxic fungi, primary and secondary prevention are no longer feasible. If the mycotoxin levels are known, it may be possible to dilute the contaminated material and produce a final blended feed that contains less than the critical level of the specific mycotoxin. Such blending of feeds to reduce mycotoxin concentrations is officially permitted, with restrictions in several countries. A number of additives are available for use in practical diets to remove or detoxify mycotoxins and reduce their negative effects vested products. The moisture content of the harvested product and the ambient temperature are principal determinants of fun- gal contamination and mycotoxin production. Some fungi, such as Fusarium spp., normally infest grains before harvest; others, such as Penicillium spp., invade after harvest, while Aspergillus spp. can grow both before and after harvest. However, the pres- ence of fungi does not necessarily indicate contamination with mycotoxins. Different mycotoxins affect animals in different ways. Some are cancer-causing toxins (e.g., aflatoxin B 1, ochratoxin A, fu- monisin B1) and some are oestrogenic (zearalenones). Some af- fect the nervous system (fumonisin B1), while others affect the kidneys (ochratoxins) or suppress the immune system (aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A, and T-2 toxin). Depending on the degree of contamination, these effects will eventually have negative im-pacts on performance. It is often difficult to diagnose the ef- fects of a mycotoxin because they are not necessarily unique to a given mycotoxin, but may be shared by others or magnified by interactions with others. Many fungal species are also capable of producing several mycotoxins. Recent evidence has highlighted the co-contamination of feed samples with multiple mycotoxins, which has serious consequences for both feed safety and animal performance. The hazards induced by the simultaneous presence of several mycotoxins are not clearly understood. In addition, depending on the degree of contamination, myco- toxins or their metabolites can be deposited in meat, visceral or - gans and eggs. Their concentration in animal products is consid-erably lower than the levels present in the feed consumed by the animals, and will not cause acute toxicity in humans, but residues of carcinogenic mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins and ochratoxin A, can affect human health. In most cases, however, the principal source of mycotoxins for humans is contaminated cereals and legumes rather than animal products. alfatoxins Aspergilli, the fungi producing aflatoxins, proliferate under condi-tions of relatively high humidity and temperature, and are gener - ally regarded as storage fungi. Aflatoxin contamination is there-fore almost exclusively confined to hot climates. Aflatoxin levels in certain types of feeds (cereals and oilseed meals) are a major problem in tropical countries, and require careful monitoring and appropriate treatment. All poultry species are susceptible to afla- toxin, especially young ducks. ochratoxins Ochratoxins are produced by one Aspergillus species and two Penicillium species. Both are storage species, but Aspergillus thrives in hot, humid conditions, whereas Penicillium fungi are essentially temperate. Ochratoxins are therefore problems in both tropical and temperate regions. Ochratoxin A and B are two forms that occur naturally as contaminants, with A being more ubiquitous and occurring predominantly in cereal grains and the tissues of animals fed with contaminated feedstuffs. fusarium mycotoxins Fusarium fungi are \"field moulds\", as arable conditions (high moisture) favour their survival and growth. Fusarium fungi are ubiquitous, and cereal grains and animal feed are contaminated 78 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry feed availability and nutrition in developing countrieson animals. These additives fall into two categories: mycotoxin binders, which bind and adsorb the mycotoxins and prevent their absorption in the gut; and mycotoxin deactivators, which deac- tivate mycotoxins (afla- toxin, ochratoxin and fumonisin) can be effectively reduced by the inclusion of appropriate adsorbent-type binders, while others (trichothecenes and zearaleone) can be removed only by deac- tivation. Common mycotoxin binders include hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate, yeast-wall polysaccharides, and clays such as zeolites and bentonites. Different sorbents have dif-fering affinities for specific mycotoxins. However, there is a risk that non-specific adsorbing agents may prevent the uptake of micronutrients in the gut. Some effective mycotoxin deactivators that are now available act by enzymatic degradation of mycotoxins. H.P ., eds. 2002. Foodborne diseases. Boston, Massachusetts, USA, Academic Press.

The proportions in these two categories vary widely among countries, but in lower-income countries, indigenous stock com- prises as much as 90 percent of the poultry population (Pym, Guerne Bleich and Hoffmann, 2006). The critical distinction between the two forms of production relates to management: commercial stock are generally reared in confinement and housed in flocks ranging from 100 to 200 birds (small) to more than 10 000 birds (large). The birds are usually given compounded feeds, and the larger facilities are normally located close to urban areas. Indigenous stock are typically kept by families in rural and sometimes peri-urban areas, in small semi- scavenging flocks of ten to 30 birds, which are fed with house- hold scraps and small amounts of other feed. Women and chil- dren are usually responsible for managing family flocks (Sonaiya, Branckaert and Gueye, 1999). Performance differences between the genotypes are often very large. Commercial layers developed from imported parent stock have the capacity to lay more than 300 eggs per year, while indigenous hens often lay only 40 to 60 eggs per year (S\u00f8- rensen, in FAO, 2010). As well as the large difference in genetic potential to produce eggs, a very significant cause of the five- to eightfold difference in annual egg production is the time - 17 weeks - that a broody indigenous hen spends hatching a clutch of eggs and rearing the chicks to about seven weeks of age. Dur - ing this time, she does not lay, which shortens the remaining time available for further egg production and means that she can pro- duce only about 3.5 clutches per year. Quantity and quality of feed is another significant factor in the disparity in annual egg production between the two genotypes. Commercial genotypes are normally provided with carefully com- pounded feeds, which include nutrients in the correct propor - tions for maximizing egg production. They are usually also fed ad libitum. The energy and protein intake of indigenous birds in scavenging flocks is determined by the scavenging feed resource base, and is usually quite limited, particularly in the dry season. To maximize egg production, the capacity for broodiness has been bred out of commercial-strain layer hens. They are therefore incapable of natural reproduction, and their value in a village environment is thus quite limited.The growth rate of indigenous genotype chickens is also gener - ally much slower than that of commercial broilers. While broilers under typical confinement rearing may reach 2.0 kg live weight at five weeks of age, indigenous-breed male birds often weigh no more than 1.0 kg at 20 weeks (S\u00f8rensen, in FAO, 2010). This is a reflection of true genotype differences, but also of rearing envi- ronment, in which feed quantity and quality is the major factor. Despite their lower productivity, in the village environment, the indigenous genotype birds have a number of advantages: The hens become broody, so can reproduce without the need for artificial incubation and brooding. They are agile and can run fast, fly and roost in trees, so can escape predators. They have been shown to be more resistant to bacterial and protozoan diseases and to parasitic infestations than com- mercial broilers or layers are. Their meat and eggs are generally preferred to those from commercial birds, not only by rural communities but also of- ten by urban dwellers. commercial selection for meat anD egg ProDuction The dramatic gains in poultry meat and egg production from indi- vidual birds in commercial flocks over the past 50 years are largely due to genetic selection in the nucleus breeding flocks of large global poultry breeding companies and the rapid transfer of these gains to the commercial cross-bred progeny. This has been facilitated by high reproductive rates, short gen- eration intervals, reduced environmental variation, large popula- tion sizes to minimize the detrimental effects of inbreeding, and the use of several differentially selected sire and dam lines. To date, much of the improvement in performance has been derived from the application of quantitative genetic selection, with limited use of molecular technologies. The large majority of commercial broilers and layers in develop- ing countries have been produced from imported grandparent or parent stock originating from large global breeding companies. There are also a few smaller breeding operations that supply stock to regional markets. broilers The continued annual productivity gains of commercial broiler flocks are a reflection of the complex and coordinated approach adopted by breeders to maximize performance. Breeders have selected for such traits as growth rate, breast meat yield, food utilization efficiency, skeletal quality, heart and lung function, and livability. This has had considerable positive effects on bird wel- fare, as well as on the environmental impact of production.81 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countriesOver the past 30 years or so, genetic selection for growth rate, feed efficiency, yield and livability is estimated to have reduced the feed required to produce 1 tonne of chicken meat from 20 to 8.5 tonnes, a 2.4-fold reduction (McKay, 2008). This has had profound positive impacts on the envi- ronment and on the availability and cost of poultry meat to the human population. Breeders continue to pay attention to growth, feed efficien- cy, meat yield, skeletal quality, general robustness and disease resistance. layers In commercial flocks, egg number, size, shell and internal quality, and layer livability, persistency of production and feed efficiency continue to improve, owing to ongoing selection for these and correlated traits. Current average annual egg production is well in excess of 300 eggs per hen, and continues to increase by more than one egg/hen/year, while the annual feed requirement for producing 300 eggs is declining by about 200 g/hen. With some 6 billion layer hens worldwide, this translates into savings of more than 1 million tonnes of feed per year. At present, layer breeding programmes focus on robustness and disease resistance, as reflected in significant improvements in livability and welfare. Considerable attention is also given to uniform size and colour of eggs and to freedom from shell and internal defects. Both broiler and egg breeding programmes are now concen- trating on molecular marker-assisted selection (genomics). This approach provides a means of identifying and selecting for or against the genes affecting production traits, particularly those that are difficult to measure, and for the genes affecting disease resistance. genetic aPProaches to imProveD Performance in sub-oPtimal conDitions The non-genetic factors mitigating against good performance from poultry in developing countries typically include: high temperatures; sub-optimal nutrition; increased disease challenge; sub-optimal housing and management conditions. All genotypes are affected by these factors. Alongside efforts to improve the physical environment, possible genetic approaches include: selection in commercial genotypes for improved tolerance to prevailing conditions; cross-breeding between commercial and indigenous geno-types; introgression of genes from commercial genotypes, via back-crossing or cockerel exchange programmes; selection for improved performance in indigenous genotypes.selection in commercial genotypes The genetic stock from which the large majority of com- mercial broilers and layers in developing countries are de- rived was selected for production under relatively ideal management conditions in temperate climates. Little if any emphasis has been given to tolerance to high temperatures or to sub-optimal management and feeding conditions. High ambient temperature is probably the main factor limit- ing the performance of commercial broilers and layers in medium to large-scale production units in tropical developing countries. Other factors can be addressed at moderate cost by establish-ing appropriate management strategies, but the cost of facilities and the availability of a secure and reliable electricity supply make shed cooling problematic. A relatively simple approach to improving heat tolerance in commercial stock, without having to develop separate full selec- tion lines, is to incorporate single genes affecting feather cover into the parent lines of stock to be used in high-temperature re- gions. Reduced feather cover facilitates loss of body heat. Genes shown to be effective in conferring heat tolerance include na-ked neck (Na), scaleless (sc) and frizzle (F) (Cahaner et al., 2008). Commercial lines that express some of these genes are now avail- able in some countries. Irrespective of selection for heat tolerance, commercial broiler and layer genotypes require good management and feeding to realize their genetic potential for meat or egg production. They are not capable of good performance un- der semi-scavenging village conditions. Several approaches have been used in efforts to incorporate the genes associated with superior egg and meat production in commercial strains into stock intended for use in less optimal envi- ronments. Such environments range from semi-scavenging village production systems, where virtually the only inputs are household scraps, through small-scale to medium-scale commercial opera- tions, where birds are confinement-reared and fed with com- pounded diets, but are exposed to high ambient temperatures. cross-breeding In many regions, local indigenous and commercial genotypes have been crossed in attempts to provide birds that are tolerant to local conditions while also capable of reasonable performance. In nearly all cross-breeding programmes, the cross-bred bird exhibits considerably better egg production and/or growth rate than the indigenous breed parent, but problems can be encountered with: loss of broodiness in hens, making them incapable of repro-ducing naturally; the need for maintaining separate parent lines/breeds and for the annual replacement of F1 cross-bred chicks; the need for additional inputs (particularly feed) to achieve the birds' genetic potential for production; a change in appearance and \"type\", which affects the birds' acceptability to farmers and the consumers of poultry eggs and meat; erosion of the genetic resource. 82 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countriesintrogression and cockerel exchange Another strategy for improving the performance of local popu- lations is through introgression of genetic material. This can be achieved though back-crossing or cockerel exchange pro- grammes. Experience has shown that for a back-crossing programme to be sustainable, increasing levels of supplementary feed and improved management and disease control are required as the frequency of exotic genes increases. Cockerel exchange pro- grammes involve distributing cocks of improved breeds to small- holders. However, several reports have concluded that this type of improvement has not changed the basic populations, except for contributing to a larger variation in plumage colour (Besbes, 2008). selection within indigenous breeds Selection for improved production within indigenous breeds or ecotypes is problematic for the following reasons: Effective selection depends on accurate recording of pedi-gree and performance. All birds should be subject to similar environmental variation. Egg production under cage confinement may be poorly cor - related with reproductive performance under semi-scaveng-ing conditions. The components of reproduction under semi-scavenging conditions are very complex, making selection under these conditions exceedingly difficult. Despite considerable genetic variation in most indigenous breeds for egg and meat production, the complexity of the pro-duction system and of the desirable traits presents considerable obstacles to effective selection for improved performance. There are examples where performance has been improved through this approach, but they are few and the gains have been modest (S\u00f8- rensen, in FAO, 2010). genetic Diversity anD conservation of genetic resources There is widespread concern in developing countries that as a re- sult of replacement of low-producing breeds, urbanization, cross- breeding and the stamping out of flocks in response to outbreaks of disease, the world is losing valuable and irreplaceable poultry genetic material. Concerns about a loss in genetic variability in commercial poultry strains have also been voiced following dramatic global reductions in the number of commercial poultry breeders and the number of populations under selection over the last 20 years (Arthur and Albers, 2003). A major con- cern is that the reduced genetic variability could place the industry in jeopardy in the event of a major disease out- break involving new virus strains. the state of the w orld's animal genetic resources, pub- lished by FAO, found that of 2 000 avian breeds for which data were available, 30 percent were reported at risk, 35 percent not at risk, and the remainder were of unknown risk status (Hoffmann, 2008). In the past, genetic diversity was largely determined by phe- notype. Recently, DNA analysis has provided an invaluable new technology for determining the relationships among individu-als, breeds and ecotypes. Clustering methods using microsatel- lite markers have been effectively applied to assign individuals to their breed of origin, and to determine the degree of genetic diversity between populations. Recent studies have shown a large range of within-breed or ecotype heterozygosities, of 28 percent for a fancy breed, 40 percent for white-egg layers, 45 to 50 percent for brown-egg layers, 50 to 63 percent for broilers, and 67 percent for a population of village chickens (Tixier-Boichard, Bordas and Rognon, 2008). Studies in Africa have suggested that village chickens do not seem to exhibit a typical breed structure. While there is a high degree of between-bird variation in a village, differentiation be- tween populations is observed only among those separated by large geographical distances. There is therefore considerable exchange of birds among adjacent villages. This suggests that many countries' claims to have a significant number of breeds or ecotypes of indigenous village-type chickens in a region may well be found by molecular measures to be based on a minimal degree of genetic diversity. An integrated approach to breed characterization is required, and data on production systems, phenotypes and molecular markers should be combined to facilitate this. A comprehensive description of production environments is needed, to improve un- derstanding of the comparative adaptive fitness of specific animal genetic resources. The characterization of defence mechanisms against patho- gens should be a priority, given the significance of the threats posed by epizootics and climate change. Field and on-station phenotypic characterization is therefore highly desirable. references arthur, J.a. & albers, g.a.a. 2003.

CD-ROM.84 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countrieslocation anD Distribution of inDigenous birDs Despite the lower productivity of indigenous poultry genotypes compared with that of commercial strains, indigenous genotypes still comprise a large proportion of the overall poultry population in many developing countries, frequently in excess of 80 percent. In rural villages in most countries, the majority of families have small flocks of poultry, mainly chickens but sometimes other spe- cies including ducks, turkeys and guinea fowls, which provide family needs for poultry meat and eggs. These birds are invariably indigenous genotypes, or cross-breeds with a significant indig- enous genotype component. Because chickens account for more than 90 percent of the total poultry population in most countries, and because only limited information on other poultry species is available, the following discussion focuses on chickens. In most countries, flocks of indigenous breed birds are not found in significant numbers in urban or peri-urban areas, ow- ing to the lack of scavenging opportunities. In some countries, there are restrictions on small-scale scavenging flocks in urban and peri-urban areas, because of the risk of disease transmission (particularly HPAI) to the human population and to commercial poultry flocks. the retention of inDigenous Poultry breeDs Their low productivity raises the question as to why indigenous chicken genotypes in rural regions have not been replaced by commercial genotypes. There are several reasons for this: Most indigenous genotypes still go broody, and can thus hatch their own eggs without recourse to artificial incubation and hatching, which are necessary for nearly all commercial geno- types. Most indigenous breed hens have strong mothering instincts and rear their young up to an age when they can fend for themselves under a scavenging management system. Most indigenous chicken genotypes are light-bodied, alert and can run fast and fly. They are thus more able to escape from predators than commercial genotypes, particularly meat chick- ens. In most countries, the meat and eggs from indigenous geno-types are generally preferred to those from commercial broilers and layers, not only by rural but also often by urban dwellers, who will pay a premium for these products. Indigenous genotypes have been shown to be more heat-toler - ant and resistant to bacterial and protozoan diseases and para-sitic infestations than commercial broilers or layers. Commercial broilers and layers perform far less well under scavenging than under commercial confinement rearing and feeding conditions. This poor performance and the cost of chicks make it uneconomic to rear commercial broilers under scavenging conditions. Although most regions have significant numbers of sector 3 small-scale commercial confinement rearing and feeding op-erations with broilers or layers, the cost and risk associated with setting up and operating such enterprises are prohibitive for most poor rural families. The performance of indigenous genotypes improves under commercial confinement rearing and feeding conditions, but generally not to an extent that makes production economically vi- able, mainly owing to the cost of compounded feed. However, if the premium paid for eggs and meat is sufficiently high, this form of management in medium-sized units can be justified. This is to some extent self-limiting, because if the market is flooded with indigenous meat and eggs, the premium paid for them will fall. contribution to Domestic ProDuction anD consumPtion of chicKen meat anD eggs The poor productivity of indigenous birds means that their total contribution to poultry meat and egg production and consump- tion is considerably lower than their numerical contribution to the overall poultry population. However, because of their large numbers, their estimated contribution to meat consumption can be quite high in many countries (Pym, Guerne Bleich and Hoff- mann, 2006). Based on published reports of flock structures, productivity and egg management in several countries, a study to estimate indigenous chickens' contribution to the overall consumption of chicken meat and eggs found that in countries where indigenous birds comprised about 80 percent of the total chicken population, adult indigenous breed hens accounted for about 20 percent of the total chicken population The study assumed that broilers and layers each made up about 10 percent of the standing popula- tion, that layers were replaced annually, and that there were four batches of broilers per year. The study then estimated indigenous chickens' contribution to egg and meat consumption, based on: average egg production of between 40 and 60 eggs/hen/year from 3.5 clutches per bird; the preference in most communities for hatching the eggs to produce chicks, rather than eating the eggs;contribution of indigenous genotypes to production and consumption of poultry meat and eggs Robert Pym, School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Gatton, 4343, Queensland, Australia85 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countries a generally high hatching rate of approximately 80 percent; a high chick mortality rate, with between 60 and 70 percent of chicks dying in the first seven weeks of life, meaning that an average of only one or two chickens are eaten per hatch of eggs. The indigenous breeds' contribution to egg consumption was found to be low, at about 10 percent, while that to meat con- sumption was much higher, at about 50 percent. Although these estimates are imprecise, in the absence of oth- er published figures they provide a reasonable basis for compari-sons of the production and consumption of indigenous and com- mercial genotypes. As countries develop and their populations become more urbanized, the proportions of meat and egg con- sumption from commercial genotypes increase. In rural regions, however, there are strong arguments for retaining indigenous genotypes in small family scavenging flocks. The productivity and profitability of small-scale family poultry production are critically linked to bird mortality rates, particu-larly among young chicks. These are normally very high owing to predation, disease, malnutrition and climate exposure. Mortal- ity rates have been shown to reduce dramatically when chicks are reared in confinement with the hen, are creep-fed for the first couple of weeks after hatching, and are vaccinated against Newcastle disease (Alders and Pym, 2008). Adopting these pro- cedures will minimize losses and ensure that indigenous poultry genotypes continue to be important in rural communities for many years to come. references alders, r.g. & Pym, r.a.e. 2008.

CD-ROM.86 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countriescommercial selection for meat and egg production Robert Pym, School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Gatton, 4343, Queensland, Australia Breeding for meat and egg production is an exceedingly complex process involving effective and accurate selection for numerous traits in the sire and dam lines to ensure that the final cross-bred commercial bird possesses all the required attributes. As a conse- quence, breeding programmes are very costly. A large population with significant numbers of active and re- serve sire and dam lines is required to permit the full exploitation of genetic variation in the component traits and to reduce the effects of inbreeding. This makes it difficult for smaller breed- ing operations to compete effectively with large global breeding companies, although smaller breeding companies are viable sup-pliers to niche markets in some areas. broiler breeDing Programmes In commercial broiler breeding programmes, selection addresses the following areas: Feed utilization efficiency: As feed accounts for about 70 per - cent of production costs, the efficiency with which birds con-vert feed to body weight is an important trait for direct selec-tion. To enable the selection of birds from the same conditions as their progeny are expected to perform in, some breeding companies have started to replace single-bird cage selection with selection of individual birds from group floor housing, us- ing transponders on the birds and feeding stations to record food consumption. Breast meat yield: Because of the relatively high price of breast meat in developed countries, considerable efforts have been directed towards improving this trait. Approaches include sib selection based on conformation and, more recently, indirect measurement technologies involving real-time ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, computer-assisted tomography and echography. Ascites: Breeding for rapid growth and high breast meat yield resulted in an inadequacy in the cardio-pulmonary system's ca-pacity to oxygenate the increased blood flow associated with the increased muscle mass. This led to a significant increase in ascites in broiler flocks during the 1990s, particularly during winter. Prior to this, ascites was normally encountered only un- Figure 1 Numbers of birds and generations involved in the transmission of selection response from nucleus lines in commercial broiler breeding programmes to the commercial broiler progeny GGPGenetic ImprovementPedigree SelectionThousands Tens of thousands 10 000 000 400 000 000 70 000 000 TonnesGRANDPARENT STOCKBROILER INDUSTRY STRUCTURE PARENT STOCK BROILERS PROCESSING CONSUMERSPURE LINES 45 000 000 000 Source: McKay, 2008. 87 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countriesder cold, high-altitude conditions. Selection based on oximetry and plasma levels of the cardiac-derived troponin-T enzyme was demonstrated to be effective in reducing susceptibility to ascites, and this procedure has been adopted by commercial broiler breeders. Levels of ascites in the field are now greatly decreased, even at high altitudes. Skeletal abnormalities: The very rapid growth rate of broiler chickens puts an enormous strain on their immature cartilagi- nous skeletons, resulting in high incidence of leg and skeletal abnormalities. Selection based on gait, morphology and X-ray imaging has done much to reduce the expression of conditions such as tibial dyschondroplasia, spondylolisthesis and valgus and varus deformation in most commercial strains of broilers, but skeletal abnormalities continue to be a major focus in most breeding programmes. To permit the transmission of genetic improvement from the nu- cleus breeding populations (where all selection takes place) to the billions of cross-bred commercial broilers, significant multiplication through grandparent and parent populations is needed, as shown in Figure 1. The time lag between selection in the nucleus lines and gains in the commercial broiler is typically about four years. layer breeDing Programmes In commercial layer breeding programmes, selection addresses the following areas: Egg production and size: Genetic improvement in egg produc- tion and size is challenged by the highly canalized nature of the trait as determined by diurnal photoperiodic constraints; nega- tive genetic correlations between egg production and early egg size; variation in the rate of increase in egg size with age; and the need to predict persistence of lay in birds selected for breeding before the third phase of production. High-capacity computers and sophisticated statistical packages involving Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) procedures have been used to predict persistence in the laying performance of birds in current flocks, allowing selection to take place earlier and the maintenance of a relatively short generation interval. Egg quality: Shell quality is defined in terms of strength, colour, shape and texture; the first three have moderate to high herit- abilities, so respond readily to selection. Shell colour is deter - mined almost exclusively by genotype, and selection is typically based on measurement using reflectance spectophotometry. There are cultural preferences for eggs of different colours. Shell strength is a critical factor affecting profitability. Breeders have selected for improved shell strength by measuring shell thickness, specific gravity (of fresh eggs), shell deformation, and other indirect and direct parameters. Shell texture and shape aberrations and blood and meat spot inclusions are se- lected against by culling birds producing these eggs. Albumen quality has been improved by selecting for increased albumen height measured using a Haugh unit micrometer. Selection in barn and free-range environments: Effective selection for egg numbers and quality was not feasible in the past, when birds were housed under group pen conditions in barns, or free-range. Recently, technologies have been developed for attaching transponders to the birds and the nest box, with sensors that allow egg production to be recorded and eggs to be traced back to the hen that produced them, for quality measurement.

There are now some 3.3 million identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the chicken genome, which provide large numbers of potential markers for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and associated studies, allowing more accu- rate selection for multiple traits. Genomics will not replace traditional selection methods, but will allow more accurate selection decisions to be made, and breeding companies have recently made considerable invest- ments in bioinformatics. The greatest impact of this will be on dif- ficult-to-measure traits such as disease resistance and sex-limited traits, and those with low heritability. Large international poultry breeding companies have recently committed to a combined ini- tiative to evaluate and implement genome-wide selection in their respective breeding programmes. Transgenics: There are three approaches to producing trans- genic chickens: i) using viral vectors to introduce foreign DNA into the genome; ii) direct injection of DNA into the newly fertilized zygote; and iii) using a cell-based approach to make modifications to the genome. Of these, the last approach, using primordial germ cells, appears the most promising for successful targeted changes to the genome. Although transgenic technologies open up exciting pos- sibilities for poultry breeding, their application is impeded by consumers' reluctance to accept eggs and meat from transgenic commercial poultry. Selection for disease resistance: Breeding for disease resist- ance can be effective through direct selection for resistance and immunity parameters by measuring the response of relatives. However, the use of molecular markers is preferred, to avoid the expensive and labour-intensive tests involved in defining resist- ance in the live bird. A huge global research programme is under way to identify the molecular basis of disease resistance to the wide array of viral, bacterial, protozoan and fungal diseases af- fecting poultry. However, in spite of the enormous global effort involved, the molecular approach to disease resistance in poultry flocks has so far had only a modest impact. Two areas where relatively good re- sponse has been obtained are selection for resistance to Marek's disease, based on the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) haplotypes, and selection for resistance to avian leukosis virus, based on receptor differences in the identified genes. Combined molecular and traditional sib-selection approaches have yielded significant improvements in general robustness in a number of commercial meat and egg strains. references mcKay, J.c. 2008. The genetics of modern commercial poultry. Proceed- ings of the 23rd World's Poultry Congress, Brisbane, Australia, July 2008. CD-ROM.89 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countriesselection in commercial lines of Poultry When producing poultry stock for developing countries, large global breeding companies tend to promote the strains that are used in developed countries, most of which have temperate climates, claiming that these strains are suitable for all environ- ments. However, most of these strains have been selected for increased productivity and general robustness under relatively good management and nutrition conditions, generally without significant temperature stress. If they prove to be tolerant to sub- optimal conditions it is usually owing more to chance than to di- rected selection. To maximize performance, the companies often promote improved management standards and practices in the target countries. Given the very wide range of nutritional factors that affect per - formance, large companies have not attempted to breed birds with tolerance to specific nutritional deficiencies, but a case could be made for selecting birds for increased tolerance to heat stress (Cahaner, 2008). Heat stress has a marked impact on perfor - mance, particularly the growth of broilers, owing to their high metabolic heat output. High temperatures are a feature of most developing countries, and maintaining reasonable house tem-peratures is either too costly or simply not possible, owing to a limited or lacking power supply and other factors. As a result of this susceptibility to heat stress in broiler strains, it is standard practice in many tropical developing countries to market the birds at an early age and low weight, before heat stress becomes a major problem. genotyPe-environment interaction Studies have demonstrated genotype-environment interactions by measuring the growth or egg laying performance of different strains when subjected either to good management, high-input conditions or to harsh, low-input conditions (Besbes, 2008). Nu- trient intake is typically one of the major differences between the two conditions. In almost all the cases studied, commercial stock performed considerably better than indigenous stock under good conditions, but only marginally better, or the same, under low- input, harsh conditions (Tadelle, Alemu and Peters, 2000; Singh et al., 2004). An example of this is the comparison of egg laying perfor - mance between Lohmann Brown and Sonali hens under optimal (German Random Sample Test) and semi-scavenging conditions Figure 1 effects of breed and environment interactions on egg production Semi-scavengingLohmann BrownSonali Cage environment100150200250300 Eggs per 12 months Source: S\u00f8rensen, 1999. genetic approaches to improved performance in sub-optimal conditions Robert Pym, School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Gatton, 4343, Queensland, Australia90 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countries(S\u00f8rensen, 1999). The Sonali hens are F1 crosses between Rhode Island Red males and Fayoumi hens. Figure 1 shows the relative performances of the two strains in the two environments. The Lohmann Brown produced 303 eggs in 12 months under the op- timal conditions of the German Random Sample Test, but only 140 eggs under semi-scavenging conditions, where the Sonali produced 156. The Sonali was not tested under the German Random Sample Test, but its production was estimated at slightly more than 200 eggs (S\u00f8rensen, personal communication). There is therefore a persuasive argument for applying genet- ics to produce stock that perform well under the less than op-timal conditions prevailing in many developing countries. First, however, any improved management conditions that have been demonstrated to result in improved performance and that are cost-effective and sustainable should be applied, particularly those that improve the survival rate of young birds (confinement early rearing with the hen, with supplemental feeding and vac- cinations), the supplemental feeding of growing and older stock with locally available feedstuffs, and ongoing disease prevention measures. breeDing for Performance unDer sub-oPtimal conDitions Given the complex processes and inputs involved in genetic im- provement, there is little point in attempting to improve the per - formance of a breed with inherently low production potential. Selection of the breed(s) to use is therefore critical, and involves a good understanding of each breed's specific attributes and a clear definition of the breeding goals. Small-scale, semi-scavenging operations require dual-purpose birds that produce both eggs and meat. The opportunities for selecting for improved egg production are limited by the hen's hatching each clutch of eggs and rearing the chicks to about six or seven weeks of age before recommencing lay. The production system is complex, and emphasis on one component could have negative repercussions on another. Two obvious requirements are for broodiness and mothering ability. Some breeds/ecotypes are renowned as good layers and mothers, and are thus suitable can- didate breeds, at least as the hens in any proposed cross-breeding programme. It is rather more difficult to apply effective selection at the individual bird level because of possible marked differences in the impacts of nutritional and disease factors on individual birds' performances. Nonetheless, there is a good case for culling poor-performing hens, although there is often limited opportuni- ty to exert any selection pressure in smallholder situations, where all surviving hens are needed to maintain flock size. The greater interest in meat than egg consumption in many de- veloping countries justifies an emphasis on growth rate and body conformation, in all stock in single-breed operations, and in males in cross-breeding programmes. This should be balanced against the available feed resources. If the latter are limited, heavy body weight may be a disadvantage, as the bird may obtain sufficient nutrients to meet only maintenance requirements, with nothing left for growth. In small-scale commercial operations involving confinement rearing and supplementary feeding, there is a persuasive argu- ment for using commercial improved breeds/strains of broilers or layers. However, their suitability depends on the level and quality of feeding and the birds' likely exposure to extreme climatic con-ditions. Where feeding is sub-optimal and commercial diets are either not available or considered too expensive, there is a case for using local or other genotypes. One important factor is the relative prices paid for the meat and eggs produced by the dif- ferent genotypes. Where a significant premium is paid for meat and eggs from indigenous breeds, the confinement rearing and feeding of these birds can be justified, in spite of their consider - ably lower productivity. For all small-scale production systems in tropical developing countries, tolerance to high temperature is a key requisite in the birds. One of the most effective ways of improving heat toler - ance is through the incorporation of single genes that reduce or modify feathering, such as those for naked neck (Na), frizzle (F) and scaleless (Sc), as well as the autosomal and sex-linked dwarf- ism genes, which reduce body size (Cahaner et al., 2008). These genes are segregating in some indigenous populations, as there is natural selection for heat tolerance as an important component of reproductive fitness. There is also a good case for incorporating these genes into existing commercial lines, as the inputs and time required for this are minimal compared with those required to develop a high-producing, heat-tolerant line from a base popula- tion (Cahaner, 2008). breeDing aPProaches cross-breeding Genetic improvement can be achieved through cross-breeding, with or without genetic selection in the parent lines; through up- grading by repeated back-crossing to a superior parent breed; or through within-line selection. The cross-breeding approach nor - mally involves a two-way cross between an improved exotic and a local breed, with the aim of combining the better production capacity of the former with the latter's adaptability to harsh envi- ronments. This system also maximizes the expression of heterosis, or hybrid vigour, in the cross, normally reflected in improved fit- ness characteristics. Examples of this approach are the Bangladesh and Indian cross- breeding programmes, which are described in some detail by S\u00f8-rensen (FAO, 2010). Briefly, the Bangladesh programme is based on crosses between Rhode Island Red (RIR) males and Fayoumi females to produce the F1 Sonali cross-bred. RIR is a United States breed that has been used by many commercial breeding compa- nies globally as the base population for their brown-egg lines; Fayoumi is an Egyptian breed with reasonable egg production under difficult environments, and is particularly known for its ge-netic resistance to disease. The cross-bred Sonali fowl has proved to be the highest-yielding and most profitable breed combina- tion in several comparisons under semi-scavenging conditions in Bangladesh (Rahman et al., 1997). The Indian programme is based on crossing Aseel breed males with CARI Red hens to produce cross-bred CARI Nirbheek hens. The native breed Aseel is well adapted to tropical conditions and is known for its high majestic gate and dogged fighting qualities, which make it capable of protecting itself against predators; the female CARI Red has been selected for improved egg production capacity under tropical conditions. In the field, CARI Nirbheek hens receiving about 30 g of supplementary feed per day were 91 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countriesable to produce 163 eggs a year, with a survival rate of 90 to 95 percent (Singh et al., 2004). upgrading through back-crossing Poultry genetic improvement programmes through repeated back-crossing of female offspring with the superior-performing male parent breed, or through cockerel exchange programmes in which males of improved breeds are distributed to smallholders, have not been particularly successful. In both cases it is necessary to retain separate populations of parent birds, and the progeny often lose the capacity for broodiness, so cannot hatch or rear their young. This is a major shortcoming given the purpose for which the birds are being produced. In addition, the survival of improved breed males is often threatened by their lack of adapta-tion to the environment and its dangers. Not the least of these dangers is the attractiveness of these birds to other farmers, re- sulting in frequent thefts for breeding or eating. These limitations also apply to cross-breeding programmes. within-line selection Within-line selection for increased growth or egg production in- volves complex procedures that have to be undertaken at a cen- tral breeding station (Besbes, 2008). The need for a sufficiently large population, pedigree recording, accurate measurement of individual performance and the capacity to minimize environ- mental variation makes it impossible for individual farmers to run an effective selection programme. Even when the necessary re- sources are available at a central breeding station, response is generally slow, and the logistics for distributing selected stock to farmers pose considerable difficulties. Economies of scale are very relevant, as evidenced by the dramatic reduction in the number of poultry breeding companies globally over the past 20 years. There is certainly need for stock with the capacity to perform well under the less than optimal environments typically encoun- tered in developing countries. The link between performance and nutritional and other management inputs means that any genetic improvement in performance capability must be matched by in- creased inputs. Genetic improvement through cross-breeding or back-crossing undoubtedly results in improved egg and/or meat production (provided it is accompanied by increased nutritional and other management inputs), but account should be taken of: the increased complexity of running several different lines; the birds' probable loss of broodiness and capacity to rear their young; the impact that it may have on farmers' interest in the chickens and on consumers' interest in their meat and their eggs. Although within-line selection avoids most of these problems, to be effective, it needs to be conducted at a central breeding sta- tion, and to be well organized and funded. The choice of breed(s) for the base population is critical to the success of the enterprise. references besbes, b. 2008.

World's Poultry Science Journal, 56(1): 45-54.92 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countriesbreeD DeveloPment anD genetic Diversity Globally, there is enormous genetic diversity within most poultry species resulting from: the activities of poultry fanciers and breeders around the world over many years; the prodigious numbers of small semi-scavenging flocks kept by subsistence farmers in developing countries; commercial breeders' efforts to produce high-performing meat and egg production lines of birds. Many of the breeds developed over hundreds of years were se- lected for morphological and appearance characteristics as much as for production purposes. This is demonstrated by the huge numbers of chicken breeds and ecotypes found globally. The principal features of poultry that permit rapid increases in the numbers of breeds and ecotypes in all countries are their very high reproductive rates and short generation intervals. Paradoxi- cally, it is this capacity that now threatens the survival of many earlier-developed breeds. The need for high production efficien- cy, combined with the complexity and cost of running effective breeding programmes has resulted in commercially selected lines of broilers and layers replacing several of the breeds previously kept for productive purposes; over the past 20 years, there have also been dramatic reductions in the numbers of commercial breeding companies and genetic lines. In any discussion of genetic diversity, \"breeds\" are essentially cultural concepts rather than physical entities. This is because breed standards have long been defined by phenotype, which may or may not involve significant differences in genotype. It is only recently that molecular tools capable of defining the de- gree of genetic diversity between different breeds have been developed. It is therefore necessary to adopt a broad definition of breed, until the term has been defined by a more objective measure. Poultry breeds can be categorized into several different group- ings according to present and past usage. Russell (1998) differ - entiates poultry breeds as: industrial or commercial lines; breeds used in traditional agriculture, historical breeds including old lan-draces; game breeds used primarily for cockfighting; ornamen- tal breeds or those used mainly for exhibition; and experimen- tal lines. Within these breeds there are many feather colour and comb variations (Simianer and Weigend, 2007), suggesting that a huge degree of genetic diversity is available, and posing questions regarding how best to allocate the limited resources for conserv- ing this wide diversity as effectively as possible.breeD categories anD risK status There is currently considerable concern regarding the number of poultry breeds that are either extinct or at risk of extinction. This information has been obtained from the State of the World's Ani- mal Genetic Resources (FAO, 2007b), the first ever assessment of domestic animal diversity. The assessment process included up- dating the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD- IS) global databank, which now contains breed-related informa- tion on 16 avian species, with 3 505 country breed populations and about 2 000 breeds. Chicken breeds make up the vast ma- jority (63 percent) of total avian breeds, followed by ducks (11 percent), geese (9 percent) and turkeys (5 percent); indigenous or local breeds make up most of the world's poultry genetic diversity. Breeds have been categorized according to whether they occur in one country (local), several countries in the same region (regional transboundary), or several regions (international transboundary). The proportions of each of these categories vary considerably from region to region (see Hoffmann, 2008 for details). As noted by Hoffmann (2008), population data are frequently missing, which makes risk assessment extremely difficult. The ab-sence of data is a result of the difficulties with monitoring small livestock and the general low importance that most governments attribute to poultry, despite their important roles for food security, rural livelihoods and gender equity. For 36 percent of reported avian breeds, the risk status is unknown; 35 percent are reported as not at risk, and 30 percent as at risk. Of 2 000 reported avian breeds, 9 percent - mainly chickens (83 percent) - were reported as extinct (FAO, 2007b). Most of these extinct breeds were from Europe (Figure 1). The regions with the highest proportions of avian breeds clas- sified as at risk are North America, with 73 percent of total avian breeds, and Europe and the Caucasus, with 51 percent. Among the different avian species, the proportions of breeds at risk are 36 percent for chickens and turkeys, 31 percent for geese, and 25 percent for ducks. conservation of Poultry genetic resources Indigenous poultry breeds' importance for subsistence farmers in many developing countries, combined with many consumers' preference for their eggs and meat, suggests that these genetic resources are not under immediate threat. However, gradual ero- sion of the genetic integrity of the stock, through cross-breeding and upgrading programmes, is cause for concern. In addition, the actual genetic variation between so-called different breeds of indigenous birds in neighbouring regions has sometimes been shown to be minimal, owing to long-term exchanges of breeding genetic diversity and conservation of genetic resources Robert Pym, School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Gatton, 4343, Queensland, Australia93 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countriesstock among villages. Substantial genetic diversity among village chicken populations is observed only in populations separated by wide geographical distances (Tixier-Boichard, Bordas and Rog- non, 2008). Poultry fanciers in developed countries play a vital role in the retention of genetically diverse populations of poultry species. The high reproductive rate and short generation interval of most species mean that viable breeding populations can be maintained at reasonable cost. Most \"pure breeders\" are motivated by the pleasure that the stock and the breeding enterprise bring them, but they are without doubt a largely untapped and vital source of avian genetic resources and diversity. These breeders and the smallholder poultry farmers in developing countries provide im- portant means for the in vivo conservation of poultry genetic re- sources. Recently, poultry genetic resources have suffered significant losses due to the termination of commercial lines associated with breeding company take-overs and the global consolidation of commercial poultry breeding operations. There have also been significant losses of experimental lines, most of which are gener - ated at research institutions; it is becoming increasingly difficult to find the funds necessary for retention of these lines. As well as in vivo conservation, genetic material is also con- served in vitro, mainly through cryo-preservation of semen. Under this approach, repeated back-crossing is required to re-establish a breed, which may take up to seven generations. In addition, the original genome of the lost breed can never be fully restored through this approach, owing to the loss of mitochondrial DNA. Although cryo-conserved embryos allow the complete re-estab- lishment of a breed, this is not possible for avian species at pre- sent. Cryo-conservation of isolated embryonic cells, primordial germ cells or blastoderm cells may be an option in the future, but is currently too costly for genetic conservation programmes (Hoffmann, 2008).conservation Programmes From the FAO database, it is estimated that about 25 percent of chicken breeds are included in conservation programmes, but there is no information about the nature or efficiency of these programmes. According to country reports to FAO, only 15 per - cent of countries (half of them developing countries) have poul-try conservation programmes (in vivo and in vitro), covering 63 percent of local breeds and 11 percent of national populations of transboundary breeds. The Global Databank shows that 195 poultry breeds (of which 77 percent are chickens, 9 percent ducks, 9 percent geese and 3 percent turkeys) have conservation programmes, but some of these data are out of date. Hoffmann (2008) provides details of country-specific programmes that may not be recorded in the Global Databank. measuring genetic Diversity Recently, there has been a major shift from the differentiation of poultry breeds according to morphological and feather colouring characteristics, to differentiation based on measurements at the molecular level. The use of molecular markers can provide quan-tified criteria for assessing genetic diversity, either within or be- tween populations. However, although they can be used to study relatedness between populations, provide information on past history of populations, detect introgressions and contribute to the genetic definition of a breed's entity, molecular markers do not provide information on phenotypes and special adaptive traits. Appropriate sampling is critical to the molecular characterization of a breed for comparative purposes; a minimum of between 30 and 50 individuals is required. Determination of the chicken genome in 2004 (Hillier et al., 2004) has facilitated the use of molecular markers for breed/ecotype characterization. Although genome knowledge is less complete for other poultry species, linkage maps are available for ducks, quails and turkeys, and ref- erence to the chicken genome is generally an efficient approach for studying gene order and gene structure. The availability of mo- lecular markers is therefore not a limiting factor in most poultry Figure 1 risk status of local and regional chicken breeds, by region Extinct Unknow At risk Not and Pacic Europe Latin America and the Caribbean Near East North America Source: DAD-IS.94 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry genetics and breeding in developing countriesspecies. Highly polymorphic microsatellite markers are preferred because they provide much information for a limited number of loci; most studies use between 20 and 30 markers. Molecular tools for studying genetic diversity using single nucleotide poly- morphisms are likely to be developed further. genetic Diversity within breeDs anD PoPulations As reported by Tixier-Boichard, Bordas and Rognon (2008), stud- ies using microsatellite markers have shown large variations in heterozygosity, ranging from 28 percent for a fancy breed to 67 percent for a village population, but the average value (of about 50 percent) is rather lower than that observed in domestic mam- mals. The highest levels of within-population diversity were found in wild ancestor species, unselected local populations, a few standardized breeds kept in large populations, and some com- mercial broiler lines. A range of values were obtained for Euro- pean fancy breeds, reflecting the variability of population history within this type of population. Expected values for heterozygosity range from 50 to 63 percent for broilers and 45 to 50 percent for brown-egg layers, to about 40 percent for white-egg layers, which exhibit the lowest levels of all commercial lines. These stud- ies suggest that there is a significant reservoir of genetic diversity within local breeds of chickens. monitoring of genetic PoPulations The Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources (FAO, 2007a) identifies the need for country-based strategies to ensure that inventory and monitoring activities can be linked to and co- ordinated with action plans such as agricultural censuses or live- stock population surveys. Monitoring requires the regular check- ing of population status and the evaluation of trends in the size and structure of breeds/populations, their geographical distribu- tion, risk status and genetic diversity. Because of their important contribution to poultry meat consumption in rural regions of de- veloping countries, it is highly desirable that local breed chicken populations are monitored. Such monitoring will contribute to the planning of national development policies in these countries. references fao. 2007a.

Bagust , Department of Avian Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne, Australia introDuction In the last half century, significant increases in the productivity of modern poultry stocks have been achieved for both the meat and the egg production sectors of the global poultry industry. Synergies have resulted from advances made in all the major ac- tivities of poultry management and housing, nutrition and ration formulation, applying poultry genetics knowledge in commercial breeding programmes and better diagnosis and control of avian diseases. Of all these core elements, poultry health and disease can be the least predictable. Although poultry diseases from nutritional and metabolic caus- es can be of concern, the emphasis in this information note is on controlling diseases that are caused by infectious agents, which can exert damaging - and sometimes immediate - negative ef- fects on the profitability of commercial operations. The develop- ment of an intensive poultry industry in many of the countries discussed here depends on the growth in number and size of small and medium-sized commercial poultry operations. The em- phasis in this review is therefore primarily on optimizing poultry health for this scale of operations. Because of the importance of small-scale village-based production units in many developing countries, however, the poultry health implications for and from such flocks are also included. Poultry Diseases: P athogens anD their costs to ProDuction systems Pathogens are disease-causing microorganisms, and include various bacteria, viruses and protozoa. A specific pathogen is a microbe that is able to cause a spe- cific disease following inoculation of a susceptible host chicken with a purified culture. For example, avian health research has shown that ILT virus is the sole cause of the poultry respiratory disease syndrome recognized in the field as infectious laryn- gotracheitis (ILT), while the bacterium Pasteurella multocida is the specific cause of another respiratory disease known as sub- acute fowl cholera. \"Although the relative importance of poultry diseases may dif- fer between countries and geographical areas, there are few important diseases that are unique to particular parts of the world\" (Biggs, 1982). At the global level, however, differences in distribution among regions are now apparent, because genetic variants have emerged within some of the major specific pathogens of chick- ens. This has become important for attempts to prevent the spread of virulent strains through international movements of poultry products. Table 1 shows the regional distribution of dif-ferent biotypes of some important pathogens in 2008. Inter- regional variation in the distribution of pathogen strains of higher virulence will become more significant in trade, as the poultry industries of developing countries enter export markets. avian pathogens in the future Emerging pathogens are those for which recognition continues to occur over time (see Information Note on \"Emerging Pathogens of Poultry Diseases).

These pathogens possess inherent properties of high transmissibility, and have enhanced resistance to inactivation (loss of infectivity) due to environmen- tal temperature and sunlight. Such pathogens therefore tend to occur more frequently on poultry sites. Table 2 summarizes the major route(s) of transmission for each of the major pathogens. Knowing the means of spread of any pathogen is fundamental to the development of a plan of action to prevent spread of the pathogen and outbreak of the disease within a production site. The poultry diseases listed in Table 2 are those likely to be caused by a single specific pathogen. Competent avian veterinar - ians and the technical personnel who undertake poultry health servicing for farmers in a modern poultry industry must be able to identify or at least suspect these diseases in their classical or relatively uncomplicated forms. Further disease effects Respiratory disease complex: Under field conditions, pathogens often interact with not only the host (bird) and its environment, but also one another. For example, day-old chicks arriving infect- ed from the hatchery (vertical transmission) and remaining chroni- cally infected for life are susceptible to other respiratory diseases such as infectious bronchitis or Newcastle disease. Fine dust parti- cles in the poultry house air can then combine with superinfection by Escherichia coli bacteria contribute to additional respiratory in- sults, which will produce the (multiple) lesions that are seen at autopsy for complex respiratory disease. Field disease interactions often also involve common immunosuppressive agents, such as infectious bursal disease, Marek's disease or chicken infectious anaemia viruses. These increase the complexity of the disease pic- tures clinically and the lesions observable at autopsy. Immunosuppression significantly decreases the ability of young poultry to respond effectively to standard vaccinations, and also predisposes them to infection by other specific pathogens. How- ever, sub-clinical immunosuppression is often not readily appar - ent to the farmer, and therefore a common \"silent\" cause of significant economic losses. Pathogens causing such infectious disease conditions are termed \"erosive\" for site productivity (Shane, 2004). In contrast, major pathogens with high death rates and rapid spread such as NDV, IBDV or HPAI, although ge- nerically termed \"catastrophic\" diseases, cause lower economic losses in the longer term than the lower-level but more pervasive and widespread erosive pathogens do. Immunosuppression re- sults from a range of known infectious and non-infectious causes, as shown in Table 3. To diagnose the cause(s), competent autopsies combined with systematic on-site investigations of flock production, vaccination history and management practices need to be undertaken. How- ever, results from laboratory examinations will often be needed to confirm a diagnosis. The Information Note on \"Poultry Disease Diagnosis: Field Skills and Laboratory Procedures\" gives further details. In the context of poultry health and disease control, the gov- ernment of a country that aims to develop a sustainable modern poultry industry MUST THEREFORE also put in place competent field and veterinary laboratory capacity for the diagnosis of poultry diseases. There is a strong need netic mechanisms, including mutation, recombination or co-evo- lution with vaccines (e.g., Marek's disease virus) or the medica- tions used (e.g., coccidiostats). There is a very high probability that several new poultry pathogens will emerge during the next ten to 20 years. The most likely candidates are pathogenic variants of avian ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, specifically those causing infectious bronchitis, Newcastle disease, infectious bursal disease and avian influenza, as well as a hypervirulent form of Marek's disease caused by an avian DNA (herpes-) virus, which is arguably the most challenging disease to control in intensive poultry industries worldwide. Developed poultry industries are characterized by on-site bi- osecurity programmes, which are designed to prevent or mini- mize incursions by known infectious diseases. These programmes are supported by close veterinary and laboratory surveillance for poultry health. A newly emergent disease can therefore most likely be recognized quickly in any developed poultry industry. However, in countries where poultry production sites still lack adequate biosecurity programmes and access to com- petent veterinary services with laboratory backup, the eco- nomic consequences and time needed to identify, control and resolve the problem are much greater. The danger is that one or more emerging pathogens become established within a country's poultry populations and then continue to pose a threat as an endemic infection. the costs of diseases within a country's poultry industry Using figures from the United States, Biggs (1982) reported that the total economic costs of disease (including vaccines and con- demnations) were about 20 percent of the gross value of produc- tion (GVP) and about three times the cost of losses from mortal- ity. An analogous 2007 analysis conducted by the University of Georgia, United States, calculated that the GVP of the United States poultry industry in 2005 was US$28.2 billion, and disease losses were 8.2 percent of this. Both studies showed that for each US$1 000 loss due to mortalities, another US$2 000 is lost else- where owing to depressed productivity resulting from disease. There is little information on the economic consequences of poultry diseases in developing counties. Hence one of the future challenges for these industries will be to organize the health in- frastructure needed to conduct such analysis. Another will be to move from using frank mortality rates as an economic indicator of losses, to accounting for and then countering the high losses of productivity that result from health-related sub-optimal pro- duction. Infrastructural capacity to diagnose the main causes of disease losses accurately will therefore prove necessary for countries seeking to develop a sustainable poultry industry. Poultry P athogens anD their major means oF transmission among Poultry ProDuction sites Table 2 lists 25 of the major infectious poultry diseases world- wide. Based on World Organisation for Animal Health listings (OIE, 2000), these are recognized globally as the diseases of most concern, because of their economic effects on commercial poul- try production and their potential for negative effects on trade. 98 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry health and disease control in developing countriesfor close collaboration between the public and private sectors in achieving this important goal. site biosecurity: the Primary key to Poultry Diseases control anD Prevention in commercial Practice Avian pathogens, which comprise disease-causing bacteria, virus- es and protozoan parasites, do not recognize national bounda- ries, only production sites and their disease control circumstances. The most important measure for sustainable and profitable production on a poultry site is therefore to have forward defences in place - i.e., a biosecurity programme whose components (see Poultry disease agent main signs and lesions produced in diseases in the field major route of spread Faeco-oral (and contact)aerosols (and contact)eggs Avian mycoplasmosis Bacterium Respiratory disease, air-sacculitis (M. lameness, joint lesions, M. synoviae+ + Fowl cholera \u00bb Bacterium Acute form - septicaemia Chronic infections are associated with respiratory and head lesions+ ( wild birds and vermin)+ Highly pathogenic avian influenzaVirus # Respiratory disease and high levels of deaths: HPAI H5N1 human deaths+ Infectious bronchitis \u00bb Virus Respiratory and kidney disease, egg production drops + Infectious larnygotracheitis Virus Respiratory disease (varying severities) and conjunctivitis + Newcastle disease Virus # Respiratory and nervous system disease: conjunctivitis (humans)+ Turkey rhinotracheitis Virus Swollen head, egg production drops, pneumonitis + Infectious bursal disease \u00bb Virus Illness and losses especially 3-5 weeks old, with immunosuppression related diseases e.g. poor growth, necrosis of wingtips, inclusion body hepatitis+ Avian leukosis and reticuloendotheliosisVirus Tumours stunted chickens, tumours + + Mareks disease \u00bb Virus Paralysis of legs and/or wings, tumours viscera, skin, nerves, eyes+ diseaseBacterium adeno Gp1 \u00bb Virus Inclusion body hepatitis broilers + + Avian adeno Gp3 Virus Egg drop syndrome in layers Contact with ducks + Avian reovirus Virus Lameness, tendosynovitis + + Avian chlamydiosis Bacterium # Infections of the spleen, liver and airsacs.

For further and pathogen-specific protection measures, the farmer will also need to have correctly applied vaccination pro- grammes for the dangerous (catastrophic) poultry pathogens that are known to be active in that region, such as Newcastle disease virus and virulent infectious bursal disease virus strains. Through this, disease outbreaks can largely be prevented, even if such pathogens gain entry to the site. A second tier of vaccinations - such as against some major immunosuppressive and respiratory disease agents (profit-erosive) - is also highly desirable. For poul- try disease control, the most common problem on sites in many developing countries is their overreliance on vaccinations, rather than investing to achieve effective site biosecurity. The primary approach to poultry health on a production site should be to at-tempt to EXCLUDE diseases, rather than allowing relatively ready entry of a pathogen to flocks and then attempting to reduce its effects by immunoprotection, i.e., vaccination. Poultry health: network builDing in a DeveloPing country. Why should a network approach be taken to poultry health? Because the real challenge for a developing country is to build sustainable poultry disease control systems that can focus and integrate their available professional poultry health resources. Although personal and political networks are often strong, professional health networking and the sense that industry personnel are working with the government sector to achieve common agreed aims can be much less evident. Frag- mentation and duplication of resources and services, along with disagreements as to which (and how) areas of weakness must be strengthened, can mean that little real improvement of overall poultry health is achieved. A distinguishing feature of the poultry health services in de- veloped countries is the regular exchange of information among industry veterinarians (although their companies will be com- mercial competitors), government health services (laboratory and field) and often the universities in a region. Such communication and cooperation occur regularly, for example, quarterly within a soundly developed industry, because it is recognized that the mu- tual benefits of communicating about poultry health matters far outweigh the collective losses from silence. How can the government agencies of a developing country position themselves to accelerate the development of a poultry industry? Experiences gained in developed poultry industries worldwide have demonstrated that investing State resources in a central poultry health facility/unit with designated functions can provide an integrated special-purpose vehicle for delivering avian health-in-production services, as illustrated in Figure 1. Government agencies and all industry stakeholders stand to benefit. Interaction between government and industry rep- resentatives is therefore essential for successful design and planning, and also later, when periodically reviewing the unit's performance in health and disease control. Industry might well contribute to financing this, for example, by providing funding for major pieces of laboratory equipment or other infrastructure that it expects will provide high benefit to itself. However, the guid- ing principle must be to achieve focused and integrated health functions for the unit to produce the health outputs needed to support sustainable poultry production in the developing country concerned. Avian veterinarians should also have pivotal roles in the poultry industry, through protecting both poultry and human health (see Information Note on \"Veterinary Roles in Health and Knowledge Transfer across a Poultry Industry\"). The primary thrust for senior government personnel, in part- nership with industry, should be the planning of human resources to strengthen laboratory and extension skills for integrated ac- tivities that can deliver appropriate health services across the four sectors of the country's poultry industry. Proof of success will be visible evidence of the private sector choosing to use government services. Investment in the construction of large purpose-built buildings or a stand-alone new facility should not be seen as the primary aim of this exercise. However, some low-cost special-purpose additions to an existing laboratory may significantly enhance the functional capacity of that unit. Examples could include the strengthening of microbiological health surveillance, or a simple building for secure maintenance of a small specified pathogen- free (SPF) poultry flock. Production of SPF eggs and chickens can then enhance local investigations, including with experimental reproduction of field diseases. The overriding goal for the central poultry services unit is to be accessible and cost-effective for the veterinary and technical personnel who service commercial poultry pro- duction operations, particularly small and medium-sized farming enterprises. The modus operandum should be fee- for-service. There will however be a clear responsibility for the services provider to direct and develop its staff resources adequately, to ensure that the services offered are relevant to the needs of the developing industry. The interfacing of industry and government poultry health production activities can then help to drive both (Bagust, 1999; Information Note on \"Veterinary Roles in Health and Knowledge Transfer across a Poultry Industry\"). For develop- ing countries, there is another interesting development prospect: if government laboratory-based services are of sufficient quality, the large-scale intensive industrial operators (Sector 1 in Figure 1) may choose to pay for using those services. This scenario is not a fantasy - in Viet Nam some industrial poultry companies have been submitting samples to a government regional diagnostic laboratory on a fee-for-service basis, thereby gaining access to the expertise of government staff in enzyme-linked immunosorb- ent assay (ELISA) serological testing. When quality services are achieved, additional benefits will be- gin to flow at the national level. First, the central poultry unit will provide a natural focus for poultry health planning by industry and government, through its functioning in laboratory services, disease intelligence and field extension-outreach. Second, it can also act as a viable interface for health intelligence between commercial industry sectors (Sec- tors 1, 2 and part of 3 in Figure 1) that have the commercial imperative and economic means to minimize the risk of disease introduction, and the village (family) poultry sector (Sector 4 in Figure 1), which is often viewed as an important reservoir of path-100 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry health and disease control in developing countriesogens of risk to commercial sectors. Although village-based poul- try are clearly quite separate from commercial enterprises, it will be vital to include this sector in health services and surveillance. Family-based village poultry production is currently undertaken by a majority of families in rural regions in many developing coun- tries, and contributes very significantly to poverty alleviation and food security. reFerences bagust, t .j. 1998.

Bagust , Department of Avian Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne, Australia what is an emerging P athogen anD how is it recognizeD? Emerge = \"to come forth into view from concealment or obscu- rity in background\". (Macquarie Dictionary, Macmillan publishers) As opposed to a specific pathogen that is known to be present as the cause of a recognizable poultry disease, an emerging path- ogen is a specific microbe that can be shown to be the causative agent of a disease that: i. has been recognized previously, but the cause has remained unclear; or ii. is a new disease syndrome that has not appeared previously. The usual sequence of events in the emergence of a disease generally starts with a novel disease becoming apparent to indus- try veterinarians and supporting diagnostic laboratories in a coun- try, or sometimes simultaneously in several countries. Serological and virological investigations will often exclude the obvious in- volvement of currently known poultry pathogens. If the disease losses caused by this new pathogen are likely to be significant, further investigations will be undertaken in the research labora- tory to clarify the pathogenesis of infection, means of transmis- sion, immunity mechanism, and potential for vaccine develop-ment or eradication, depending on which is the most appropriate approach. Cultivation of the microbial agent outside the host will usually permit serological screening to establish the prevalence of infec- tion in flocks. Diagnostic investigations may include retrospective studies of previously unresolvable field disease problems, such as avian leukosis (subgroup-J) (Example 1). The nature and intensification of the poultry industry make it seem likely that high numbers of specific pathogens will have to be excluded or prevented by vaccination at production sites, and that many pathogens will have arisen or been recognized as emerging in recent decades. The industry is not unique in this regard among the intensive animal industries (pigs, poultry and fish), but pathogen-host dy- namic interactions occur on a huge scale and are frequent within the poultry industry globally. Among production animal species, poultry have a uniquely short generation interval and must be re- produced continually, with probably about 100 million individual animals a day across the world's poultry industries. Vaccination is an essential measure for protecting poultry stocks against a range of dangerous pathogens, and during this protection process, the host's immunity continually exerts selection pressure on these poultry pathogens. Viral pathogens, particularly those with ribonucleic acid (RNA) genomes (e.g., infectious bronchitis, Newcastle disease, infec-tious bursal disease viruses, and avian retroviruses such as avian leukosis virus), are all susceptible to the development of point mutations during replication of the genome. These viruses ap-pear to lack effective proof-reading mechanisms for control of viral translation and repair of mutations during replication. Payne (2001) estimates that the rate of point mutations in avian retro- viruses is as high as one per million virions, occurring within just one twelve-hour cycle of replication. As viruses are continually mutating, so it must be accept- ed that new virus strains and disease problems will emerge in the future. Several examples of poultry pathogens that have emerged in the last decade or so are given in the following, along with a brief explanation of the mechanism(s) involved in their emergence. example 1: a vian leukosis (subgroup-j) virus This pathogen developed by genetic recombination in the field between two avian retroviruses. Between 1995 and 1998, neo- plasms were observed in young breeders, leading to major losses of broiler breeders worldwide. This was due to primary breed- ing companies having genetic stock contaminated with ALV-J, the progeny from which were then exported to more than 50 countries. Retrospective virological and serological examinations by Payne (2001) and his laboratory group showed that this virus was circulating in the United Kingdom as early as 1989, with in- fections in some flocks sporadically producing tumours then in broiler breeding stocks. example 2: newcastle disease. The emergence of virulent NDV from lentogenic strains of New-castle disease in Australia from 1999 to 2001 has been closely in- vestigated and scientifically proven using molecular epidemiology. example 3: highly pathogenic avian influenza. Because of its zoonotic potential, the emerging poultry disease of greatest concern worldwide has been avian influenza, whether HPAI H5N2 (China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 1999 and 2001) or HPAI H5N1 (in Asia from 2003 onwards, spreading to some 60 countries worldwide). This pathogen has subsequently been eradicated from all developed poultry indus- tries, but is persisting as an endemic infection of poultry in several continents.102 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry health and disease control in developing countriesthe co-evolution of viral pathogens with their vaccines and medications As do any other organisms, poultry pathogens tend to change and evolve. Antigenic change results from genetic control, and can be accelerated under immune pressure. Immune responses are geared to controlling pathogens, and include antibody pro- duction and T-cell activation against pathogen-specific protein structures, which are those most likely to change over time. Medication with antibacterial or anticoccidial drugs exerts simi- lar effects over time. Continued treatment against coccidiosis or bacteria with the same unchanging drugs, especially with sub- therapeutic doses, tends to promote the emergence of resistance to those antimicrobial or anticoccidial drugs. reFerences Payne, l.n. 2001.

World's Poultry Science Journal, 57: 265-274.the mechanisms For a Poultry P athogen's emergence genetic changes These can occur in a pathogen through accumulation of point mutations in the genome or even recombination and reassort- ment of gene sequences. These changes sometimes result in an altered pathogen with the ability to multiply more effectively in the host. Initially these changes may not be recognized, but as the mutant strain of the pathogen multiplies, becomes better adapt- ed to the host, and spreads within flocks and among production sites, disease problems can become apparent - emerge - against the background of normal expected levels of losses during pro- duction activities.103 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry health and disease control in developing countriesPoultry disease diagnosis: field skills and laboratory procedures Trevor J. Bagust , Department of Avian Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne, Australia FielD skills It is extremely important to apply a systematic approach when conducting field investigations. An autopsy (necropsy) is essential for avian veterinarians or technical services personnel seeking to establish a preliminary diagnosis. The autopsy also allows samples to be collected and submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for con- firmatory testing. Samples collected may include blood, serum, plasma, swabs, feathers, tissues, scrapings or smears, as needed for confirmation or exclusion of the potential causative patho- gens. Excellent video-based information on practical procedures for clinical examination and sample collection can be accessed at http://partnersah.vet.cornell.edu/. Two of the best general-audience articles available on flock health and poultry diseases diagnosis were published in the in- ternational poultry industry technical periodical World Poultry (Yegani , Butcher and Nilipour, 2005a; 2005b). These articles can be accessed directly by using the hyperlinks shown for each. laboratory ProceDures The following comments confirm and extend the key information in these two articles. serology is the most frequently used of the three diagnostic approaches. However, it should be noted that detection of anti- body can only be an indicator of previous exposure to a patho- gen. Serology is nearly ideal for application in flock health sur - veillance, as laboratory testing can be conducted quite readily, for both the collection and the examination of large numbers of samples from multiple flocks. Serological activities in flock health surveillance may also include monitoring the effectiveness of vac-cination programmes. microbiological investigations - bacteriology and virol- ogy: Yegani, Butcher and Nilipour (2005b) explain briefly where these tests are used in the modern industry. The following are their main advantages and disadvantages: histopathology is relatively economical, quick and useful for obtaining results, and the samples are easy to collect, store, trans- port and process. The downside of histopathology is that once a set of samples has been placed in fixative, the culture and typing of a pathogen is usually not possible. microbiology, whether bacterial or viral, it is invaluable for the isolation and culture of pathogens. However, the practitioner must exercise care to avoid cross-contamination when collect- ing the samples, and to prevent inactivation of infectivity during transport to the laboratory. Routine aerobic bacterial culture is not expensive, other types of culture and typing usually are.Culture of avian viruses is sometimes required, especially when field disease presentations are atypical or the emergence of a vari-ant form of a viral pathogen (e.g., infectious bronchitis virus) is a possibility. The disadvantages of virus culture are that it requires time - often about a week - and using culture systems is moder - ately expensive. PCR (polymerase chain reaction): This test system is highly sensitive and specific, which can be a problem. If the reagents (e.g., the primers) used are not an exact match with the patho- gen in question, false negatives will occur. False positives, through contamination while a test is in progress in the laboratory can also be a problem. Note: No laboratory test can return perfect results every time, and laboratories are not infallible. Veterinarians and technicians should always keep in mind the point made by Yegani, Butcher and Nilipour: \"It is important, when investigating poultry production- health problems, that you do NOT rely SOLELY on the re- sults of diagnostic tests\". reFerences morrow, c. 2008.

Bagust , Department of Avian Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne, Australia biosecurity Programme For commercial Poultry ProDuction sites Keep poultry in a fully enclosed area, to which entry by other people is physically restricted by having only one point of ac- cess. This access point should be enterable only through a foot- bath containing disinfectant. In general, casual visitors to a poultry production site should be discouraged. Records should be kept of all visits. the most common breaks in biosecurity occur when inFectious Poultry Diseases are introDuceD by the movements oF PeoPle. Prevent contact with wild birds and vermin by physically exclud- ing them from the site, for example, with bird netting. The poultry keeping area and equipment within it must be kept clean, and be disinfected every few months. Cleaning fol- lowed by disinfection is essential between batches of poultry. Concrete rather than earth flooring in poultry production areas greatly increases the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection. Equipment should NOT be shared among poultry sites. If it is absolutely necessary to share items, the equipment must be thoroughly cleaned AND disinfected before and after entering any poultry production site. Contamination of food and water by faeces should be strictly avoided. Feed should be stored in secure, lidded containers; the water supply should be decontaminated, for example, by a standard chlorination treatment. birds and health: Birds should be sourced from a breeder whose bird health sta-tus is known to be good, and should be of healthy appearance on arrival at the site. The new birds being introduced should be kept separate and be the last fed every day for an initial quar - antine and observation period of one month. Potential signs of diseases, which should be known by the farmer, can include: -dullness, reluctance to drink or eat; -diarrhoea, respiratory distress, a sudden drop in egg produc- tion; -inability to walk or stand, abnormal position of head, neck or wings; -sudden illness and/or death of several of the birds in a group. biosecurity Programmes are baseD Primarily on quarantine oF a site combineD with measures For stringent hygiene anD DisinFection. The strength of this approach is that it can be applied generally to exclude from a site ALL important diseases (see Table 2 in \"Poultry Health and Disease Control in Developing Countries\") apart from those that are egg-transmitted. More specialized disease prevention and control measures to sup- port biosecurity on a site include: vaccination and medication: Diseases for which these may be applied include almost all the ones listed. However in every case, the vaccine being used will be effective for the prevention of ONLY that specific disease. eradication can be applied for egg-transmitted pathogens ONLY. The pathogens for which commercial eradication pro-grammes have been successfully applied are avian mycoplasmo- sis, avian leukosis and reticuloendotheliosis viruses; fowl typhoid; and Salmonella pullorum. immunogenetic resistance to disease is promising for Marek's disease, but is not yet commercially available. biosecurity For village ProDuction - small- scale semi-scavenging Poultry Flocks (non-commercial) Although it is not possible to apply full site biosecurity where nu- merous small poultry flocks are moving about in or around com- mon areas in a village during daylight hours, modified elements of biosecurity can be applied. As a minimum, housing should be provided to shelter and pro- tect birds from predators at night time. Improved poultry health can also be achieved by combining two other general approaches: The development of central higher-quality hatchery-based ser - vices for the supply of day-old chicks Irrespective of whether the poultry stocks being supplied to farmers in a country are of an indigenous or a commercial genotype, the laboratory screening of breeding stocks for free- dom from infection, followed by the application of enhanced hatchery hygiene programmes should enable freedom to be as- sured from at least pullorum disease and fowl typhoid. Chicks supplied can also be protected early in their life against cata- strophic diseases such as Newcastle disease and infectious bur - sal disease virus before leaving the hatchery (Bagust, 1998), by 105 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry health and disease control in developing countrieshaving high levels of maternal antibody, which can be assured by undertaking vaccination of the parents. Strengthening extension services for training farmers in health and production Poultry health and production extension services can quite quickly be systematically upgraded by applying information from other developing countries, such as Bangladesh, on strat- egies/ programmes that have proven successful in practice. suPPorting strategies For control anD Prevention oF Poultry Diseases The illustration of a classical building below shows that the col- umns (the pillars) are needed to support the roof, while the roof both holds the pillars together and protects the integrity of the building. The whole building represents the production site, and the pillars are the individual supporting activities that are inte- grated into an overall biosecurity programme. The pillars represent the major technology-based approaches currently available for the control and prevention of infectious diseases of poultry. From left to right, the order of the pillars rep-resents how widespread their use should be, starting with ap- proaches that are suitable for widespread application, and mov-ing towards those that are suitable only for specific uses. Thus, while quarantine, hygiene and disinfection are universally appli-cable against poultry pathogens, vaccination can be widely, but not always, used and eradication is currently feasible only for a few pathogens. Pillar 1 - QUARANTINE: Currently, genetically based disease resistance is rarely of practical use in the field. This means that isolation is the only option. This is the oldest of the approaches, and dates back to Roman times (quaranta is Latin for 40), when a 40-day isolation period was enforced before a plague ship crew could enter a harbour or town. Pillar 2 - HYGIENE AND DISINFECTION - complements quaran- tine. When flocks are being isolated from the entry of microbes, hygiene and cleaning are the first measures used. These must result in the removal of organic material from the surfaces to be decontaminated, for example, in poultry houses or the hatchery, if antimicrobial disinfection treatment is to be effective. Pillar 3 - VACCINATION is probably the easiest and most eco- nomical group of methodologies used for the control and preven-tion of poultry diseases in poultry production. However, it should NOT be used as the sole measure on a flock. Pillar 4 - ERADICATION is a feasible disease control option for only some specific poultry pathogens. The criteria to be met are usually that the major mode of transmission is via the egg and that relatively accurate and inexpensive lab tests have already been developed for detection of infection. Although a successful eradication programme requires major investments of resources, significant benefits can flow back to industry over the longer term. Pillar 5 - IMMUNOGENETIC RESISTANCE to disease is not yet complete, but - as the case of Marek's disease virus demonstrates - it may soon become so. The solution may lie in the hands of commercial primary breeding companies, because genetic selec- tion could be applied to disease resistance, should a commercial need create pressure for this. At present, however, this is not seen as a high priority relative to other growth and production param-eters. In addition, there is a lack of effective tools for selecting for specific resistance to many major infectious poultry diseases. biosecurity Program 1. Quarantine 2. Hygiene & Disinfection 3.

Any commercial enterprise seeking continuing success in the marketplace must therefore: 1. minimize its costs of production; 2. ensure that its products are safe for human consumption. Veterinarians also have to fulfil these dual responsibilities in a modern intensive poultry industry by: Achieving the most economical poultry production The veterinarian's role in poultry health involves close collabora-tion with several other professionals working in key roles in the poultry production operation. Achieving product quality for protection of public healthThe veterinarian also has a role in ensuring that poultry prod-ucts are free from zoonoses (infectious diseases transmissible from animals to humans, such as Camplyobacter, Salmonella and listeriosis) and that they are microbiologically safe and free from environmental residues. Experience proves that the prof- itability of a food industry or commercial organization is very quickly undermined by problems with unsafe poultry products. avian health-in-ProDuction: ProFessional DeveloPment anD knowleDge transFer Veterinarians are trained to develop their capabilities for under - standing animal diseases, as well as the causes, prevention and control of a range of pathogens.

Avian veterinarians are also re- sponsible for ensuring that appropriate poultry health knowledge is transferred to the technical personnel who share responsibilities in poultry production. Avian veterinarians and other technical services personnel working in developing countries may wish to achieve higher lev- els of expertise in the performance of their commercial activities. Advice and guidance on undertaking professional development to internationally accepted standards of competency is avail-able from relevant professional international bodies, such as the World's Poultry Science Association (www. wpsa. com) or the World Veterinary Poultry Association (www. wvpa. net). Figure 2 illustrates how all the activities undertaken in poultry production can work together to achieve sustainable progress in an industry. The wheels of knowledge transfer shown in Figure 2 are lubri- cated by communication and interfacing among the personnel in- volved, so in a country seeking to develop an effective and efficient poultry industry, it is essential that personnel learn to operate in this cooperative manner. A national networking structure is the logical starting point for achieving sustainable poultry health in production, particularly through strengthened control of infectious poultry diseases.

The poultry sector is one of the most rapidly growing livestock sectors worldwide: between 1961 and 2001 the number of poul- try slaughtered annually increased by 621 percent. Although industrialized countries have much higher average per capita consumption of most poultry products, production in develop- ing countries is increasing rapidly. In 2000, Compassion in World Farming reported that average annual egg production in develop- ing countries had increased by 331 percent since 1980. Although chickens are very different from people, it is thought that they are capable of suffering from states such as pain or frustration. Ethical consideration therefore needs to be applied to poultry farming, and ways of ensuring good welfare for such large numbers of animals need to be found. what is animal welfare? The Oxford English Dictionary associates welfare with \"well-be- ing; happiness; and thriving or successful progress in life\". In rela- tion to animals, different cultures emphasize different aspects. Thus, people from different backgrounds give different relative importance to animal welfare factors such as: i) health and nor - mal biological functioning; ii) the subjective \"feelings\" of the ani-mals; and iii) the animals' ability to live a natural life (EFSA, 2005). The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) definition of an- imal welfare refers to how well an animal is able to cope with the conditions in which it lives (www.oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.7.1.htm). This definition, derived from Broom (1986), has widespread, but not universal, acceptance. Other authors continue to emphasize the importance of animals' feelings and experiences in their definitions of animal welfare (Phillips, 2009). For the purposes of this review, the concept of animal welfare refers to an animal's overall state of well-being. OIE considers that good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, humane handling and humane slaughter/killing. In general, many differ - ent components of an animal's state must be considered to judge whether its welfare is good or bad. Some of the components that FAO considers important are that the animal should be healthy, comfortable, well nourished, and safe. It is also important that animals are able to express behaviours that are priorities in a cap- tive environment (Weeks and Nicol, 2006) and that they should not suffer from unpleasant mental states such as pain, fear and distress (although these feelings cannot be measured directly). When considering animal welfare as a whole, it is important to take each of these components into consideration. measuring animal welfare The state of an animal's welfare can range from very good to very bad (Duncan and Fraser, 1997). Sometimes, however, one component of welfare is good but others are not. For example, an animal might be in good health but its ability to move may be re- stricted by caging or tethering. It is therefore important to be able to measure each component of welfare, and to devise ways of integrating the different measures to reach an overall conclusion. the five freedoms, principles and criteria for good welfare In the United Kingdom, the welfare of farm animals has been considered a formal discipline since 1965, when the Brambell Committee suggested that farmed animals should have five basic \"freedoms\" of movement, such as the freedom to stretch and the freedom to turn around. These can be considered the original components of animal welfare. However, they are rather narrow, so to take account of a broader range of animals' physical and behavioural needs, these Five Freedoms were modified in 1979 by the United Kingdom's Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC, 1979), which proposed that all farm animals should have: 1. freedom from hunger and thirst; 2. freedom from discomfort; 3. freedom from pain, injury and disease; 4. freedom to express normal behaviour; 5. freedom from fear and distress. The Five Freedoms have been highly influential, and OIE ac- cepts them as one of the guiding principles governing animal welfare. They are also referenced in most European welfare leg-islation, referred to by veterinary and animal welfare organiza- tions worldwide, and form the basis for OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code Article 7.1.1. However, they also have drawbacks. In particular, it is not easy to decide which normal or innate behav- iours are important for animals in captive environments. Recently, the European Welfare Quality consortium (www.welfarequality. net/everyone) has expanded and clarified the components of ani- mal welfare, proposing a set of four principles and 12 criteria, as shown Table 1. resource-based and animal-based measures Once the principles and criteria for good welfare have been agreed, ways of measuring each criterion need to be devised. These measures can be used on farms or other livestock enterpris- es to assess animal welfare. Early assessments of animals on farms were made by observing whether key resources (e.g., nests or clean drinkers) were present; such measures are called resource- based measures. However, the presence of a resource does not mean necessarily mean that it is being used effectively. Recently, there has therefore been a move to make direct observations and measurements of the animals themselves, using animal-based outcome measures. This is important to ensuring the good wel- fare of all individual animals within a flock or herd.111 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry welfare in developing countriesMuch progress has been made in developing valid, repeatable animal-based outcome measures for chickens. The Welfare Qual- ity Project has suggested appropriate measures that could be used to assess each of the 12 welfare criteria for poultry, and the majority of these are animal-based outcome measures. Thus, the absence of hunger can be measured by assessing emaciation on an agreed scale, and thermal comfort can be measured by assess-ing whether birds are panting or huddling. In drawing an overall conclusion about the welfare of chickens at a specific site, the measures for each criterion can be given different weights, with higher weights given to criteria that are thought to be especially important. scientific assessment of welfare It is important that the measures used on farms to assess ani-mal welfare are backed up by more fundamental scientific re- search, to ensure that they really do measure factors associated with quality of life. The scientific assessment of poultry welfare usually depends on measuring a range of physiological, behav- ioural or clinical indicators, and comparing these measurements among chickens that are housed or treated differently in some way. A broad range of indicators can be used to assess stress re- sponse and immune function in an attempt to measure whether the animal is coping with its environment or not. However, inter - pretation of these indicators is sometimes difficult. An alternative scientific approach has therefore been to examine the environ- mental conditions chosen by chickens. Early studies examined the environmental choices of chickens for food types, laying, foraging and exploratory materials, heat, lighting, and social conditions. The strength and importance of these preferences has recently been assessed by determining how hard chickens will work to obtain these resources or conditions when access becomes more difficult or demands more energy (Nicol, 2010). Important new scientific research is examining how welfare indicators and the environmental choices of chickens interrelate (Nicol et al., 2009). The International Society for Applied Ethology is a scientific body with an interest in how animal behaviour can be used to assess animal welfare (www.applied-ethology.org/index.htm). Many other organizations are interested in the scientific assessment of welfare; their newsletters can be accessed via the FAO website: www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/animal-welfare/en/.interactions between welfare anD ProDuctivity It is often thought that good production will itself guarantee good welfare, but the relationship between production and wel- fare is more complex than this. In the following two examples, welfare and production are positively associated: (i) In some backyard, village environments, chickens may be able to express normal behaviour, but their overall welfare may be poor if they are affected by disease, parasitism or malnutrition. Address- ing these welfare issues will also result in increased productivity. (ii) In many cases, acute or chronically stressful events will re- duce productivity. For example, moving hens from pens to cages produces a marked short-term decrease in egg production. Simi- larly, chronic stress can impair immune function and lead to in- creased disease and mortality, and reduced production. However, in the next two examples, welfare and production are in conflict: (i) Intense genetic selection for production traits can have ad- verse consequences on other aspects of bird health. For example, laying hens selected for high egg production have increased skel-etal problems (see information note on \"Welfare issues in com- mercial egg production\"), and broiler chickens selected for very high growth rates have problems with leg health and lameness (see information note on \"Welfare issues in commercial broiler production\"). (ii) Restricting the quantity of feed fed to broiler-breeding flocks/birds is a normal management method because egg pro- duction and hatchability are poor if female breeding birds are fed ad libitum. However, this means that the birds experience chronic hunger (see Information note \"Broilers\"). safe-guarDing animal welfare When production gains can be achieved by improving animal welfare, as in the first two examples above, there should be no need for any other mechanism to safe-guard animal welfare; ad- dressing issues of health or malnutrition will benefit both farmers and chickens. This is why poultry welfare is being integrated into food safety policy, based on scientific evidence that well-treated animals are generally healthier and more productive than badly treated ones (European Commission, 2002). OIE also recognizes the links between welfare and animal health and is introducing guidelines for the transport and slaughter of farmed animals. However, when increased production conflicts with good welfare, other checks and balances are required to ensure that the animals are not suffering or unduly exploited. The mechanisms available to ensure good welfare in these circumstances include the law, codes of practice and voluntary assurance schemes. Poultry welfare anD the law The extent to which poultry welfare is protected by the law varies greatly. In 2000, the European Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare investigated international welfare standards and found no generally recognized, specific standards worldwide. Although there appears to be little legislation in the developing world concerning the welfare of farmed animals, many other countries have laws relating to acts of cruelty to indi- vidual animals.

Most legislation refers to the Five Freedoms (FAWC, 1979), but this may change if the expanded principles and criteria mentioned earlier become widely accepted. Increased legislation often follows increased public awareness of animal welfare issues. There are two main approaches to introducing welfare legisla- tion (European Commission, 2002). Binding codes are usually in- cluded within legislation, and it is a legal requirement to conform. An example of binding legislation in the EU is the Laying Hens Directive (1999). As part of an interim review of the scientific evi- dence required before adoption of the legislation, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2005) produced an opinion on the welfare aspects of all housing systems used for laying hens. Fol- lowing this, the LayWel project, funded via the European Com- mission's Sixth Framework Programme and national funding from several EU countries, studied the welfare implications of different poultry farming systems. The scientific opinion derived from both these exercises provided the basis for banning conventional cag-es, summarizing evidence that conventional cages do not allow hens to fulfil behaviour priorities, and present a significant threat to the birds' skeletal health. The EU ban on conventional cages is scheduled to take effect from 1 January 2012. From that date, all cages must contain enrichment (furnishings to assist the birds in performing natural behaviours), such as an area for dust-bathing, and perches. The EU has also introduced a Broiler Directive (2007), which limits the stocking density at which poultry may be kept for meat production. Farmers will be able to keep broiler chickens at higher densities only when high welfare is exhibited and proved. This is likely to be assessed by looking at animal-based outcome measures such as mortality. coDes of Practice Non-binding codes of practice can be used alongside the law. Codes of practice establish recommendations for good practice as followed by competent and conscientious practitioners. Codes of practice can be particularly useful if they set out clearly what farmers must do to ensure good welfare (minimum standards), and what they can do further to optimize welfare. self-imPoseD coDes/assurance schemes In many countries, there are voluntary schemes for certifying that farm animals have been kept at specified welfare standards. Self- imposed codes are voluntary, but producers conform as they are likely to offer a marketing advantage. Examples include farm as- surance schemes, which are common in Europe. They have been introduced in response to consumer demands that animal prod- ucts satisfy certain safety, environmental and welfare standards. housing anD management of Poultry In developing countries, the majority of poultry are indigenous breeds, kept in small flocks living in a backyard, village environ- ment. Gueye (1998) reports that approximately 80 percent of poultry in Africa can be found in traditional production systems. In these systems, birds are generally free-ranging and often scav- enge or are fed household scraps. In this type of poultry produc- tion system there is no real distinction between birds reared for meat and those kept as egg layers. Poultry meat is typically ob-tained from males killed at between 12 and 20 weeks of age, and from egg laying birds that have ceased to be productive. Many developing countries are now investing heavily in more intensive commercial systems of poultry production to provide meat and eggs for growing urban and peri-urban populations. In these systems, egg laying hens and broiler meat chickens are ge-netically very different from each other and from the indigenous breeds kept in small family flocks by villagers in rural areas, and are kept and managed differently. Intensive broiler production systems obtain chicks from com- mercial hatcheries, and then house them in flocks in floor- based systems until they reach slaughter weight, when they are caught, transported and slaughtered at a specialized abattoir. Intensive egg production systems also obtain chicks from com- mercial hatcheries, but these chicks are usually kept in large rearing flocks until they reach sexual maturity and start to pro- duce eggs. At point of lay, the pullets are transported to the adult housing system, which contains egg-handling facilities. A great range of adult housing systems exists, including conven- tional cage, furnished cage, single-tier aviary, multi-tier indoor, and free-range (described in www. laywel.eu). At the end of the commercial laying period, generally at around 18 to 24 months of age, these birds are caught, transported and slaughtered in specialized facilities. major welfare issues Poultry welfare is affected by genetics, by the hatching, rearing and adult housing environments, by the methods of transport and slaughter employed, and to a great degree by the attitudes and standards of care of the stockpersons. welfare issues in a village environment In the village environment, birds are mainly indigenous breeds, which are generally better able to cope with the natural environ- ment than those breeds that have undergone extensive genetic selection for production traits. However, disease transmission is high in backyard poultry systems, often resulting in low produc- tivity and high mortality. Newcastle disease is one of the most problematic and widespread diseases in both village and intensive production systems. Vaccines have been developed, but not all farmers have access to them, and vaccinating free-ranging poul- try can be a challenge (FAO, 2001). Another challenge facing small-scale poultry producers in developing countries is the availability of appropriate nutrition. Many smallholder farmers and their families have limited food, and are thus unable to provide feed for their small scavenging chicken flocks. Poultry frequently also lack access to a source of clean and cool water. This is a welfare concern for the poultry and for the people rearing them, as productivity will be low. In hot climates, birds may have difficulty staying cool if natural or artificial shelter is not provided, as all chickens are derived from jungle-living birds and they actively seek shade. Most of these welfare issues can be addressed by improved veterinary care and nutrition and the provision of simple facilities such as clean drinking-water and shade. welfare issues of broilers in commercial production The major welfare issues for commercially reared broilers are leg 113 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry welfare in developing countrieshealth problems and lameness, metabolic disorders, and hunger in restricted-fed broiler breeder flocks. welfare issues of laying hens in commercial production The major welfare issues for commercially reared laying hens are bone problems such as osteoporosis and the high incidence of resultant bone fracture, behavioural deprivation resulting from housing in cage systems, unequal access to facilities for birds housed in non-cage systems, and injurious pecking and plumage loss, which occurs in all types of housing system. welfare issues during transport and slaughter The major welfare issues arising during transport and slaughter are high levels of stress due to inappropriate handling, and pain and stress if birds are not properly stunned before slaughter. benefits of imProving animal welfare FAO recognizes the importance of animal welfare practices that lead to benefits for both people and their animals, and supports their implementation, recognizing that the welfare of humans and the welfare of animals are closely linked: www.fao.org/ag/ againfo/resources/en/pubs_awelf.html consumer acceptance Throughout the world, people are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of farmed animals' welfare (European Com- mission, 2002). Consumers are interested in the origin of their poultry products, and surveys such as Euro-barometer show that most people believe that the broiler and laying hen industries need to improve the current level of bird welfare: http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/survey/sp_barometer_ fa_en.pdf. Consumers' perception of animal welfare can affect the type of products purchased; 43 percent of consumers say that they consider the welfare and protection of meat animals before they make a purchase. access to markets At present, the World Trade Organization (WTO) operates a free- trade policy and will not allow countries to restrict trade because of differing standards of animal welfare. This is becoming a con- cern within the EU, however, where there are guidelines relat- ing to animal welfare to which farmers must conform. The EU is pushing for welfare to be included in the WTO multi-lateral trade negotiations. If this happens, imported products will have to meet basic EU standards to enter this market. employment Improvements in animal welfare can create work in countries where employment is difficult to find. It is particularly important that intensification is coupled with increased labour, as one of the best ways of raising animal welfare standards is to improve in- spection and handling practices. Intensification without increased labour may result in welfare problems being overlooked. In many developing countries, poultry are raised by women and children. Learning how to raise poultry to optimal welfare standards can help women to improve their productivity, and may help alleviate poverty. Organizations such as the International Network for Fam-ily Poultry Development and the Network for Small-holder Poultry Development are helping village women to make their poultry enterprises more productive, efficient and profitable. This has a positive impact on the empowerment of women and provides them with social contact both within and outside the village. The model farm project set up by the World Society for the Protection of Animals and the Food Animal Initiative also aims to help farmers in developing countries to rear their animals in ways that will provide them with optimal economic outputs. A number of farms have been set up in China, where high-welfare animals are reared to organic standards and receive a premium when sold. The farms provide training for producers and exemplify a viable alternative to intensive farming. references broom, D.m. 1986 Indicators of poor welfare.

First some issues affecting chicks and growing pullets are mentioned, before discussing the most significant issues facing adult laying hens. chicks anD Pullets Disposal of male chicks When chicks are hatched for egg production, only females are needed. Male layer strain chicks have no commercial value, which means that 50 percent of the chicks hatched have to be killed. Their disposal raises practical and ethical issues. Methods of dis- posal vary from region to region and country to country. In all cases, the aim should be to ensure that every male chick is killed humanely and instantaneously. chick handling Whether chicks are to be reared for meat or egg production, it is important that they are handled with care in the hatchery. Af- ter being taken from the hatching trays by hand, chicks may ei- ther be sexed and sorted manually, or placed on a conveyor from which the males (often with different sex linked feathering rate or feather colour) are removed for slaughter. The female chicks are then placed in disposable chick boxes with perforated ventilation holes, for transport to the rearing houses. variation in chick or pullet sizes The aim of the hatcheries and farms that supply pullets should be to produce birds of even body-weight and size. Variation in size can result in later problems of aggression, poor performance and injurious pecking. laying hens osteoporosis Osteoporosis in laying hens is a major welfare concern. It is the progressive loss of structural bone throughout the skeleton, which results in weakened bones. Weakened bones can lead to a high number of birds suffering keel, leg and wing fractures, which are likely to be painful. Osteoporosis can also cause birds to become paralysed, which can lead to death. Loss of structural bone in hens begins around sexual maturity and continues throughout the laying period. The process is accelerated in caged systems, which prevent birds from exercising. Fleming et al. (2006) found significant improvements in bone strength when birds were housed in aviaries, rather than battery cages. Nutrition also ap- pears to affect bone strength, and the effects of osteoporosis can be minimized by providing sufficient calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D in the diet. Another contributor to the severity of os- teoporosis is genotype. Some genetic strains appear to be more susceptible to osteoporosis than others. It has been suggested that it is possible to select genetically against osteoporosis while still maintaining a high egg yield, but this has not been attempted on a commercial scale. keel fractures One consequence of osteoporosis is that it greatly increases the susceptibility of bones to damage and fracture. In laying hens, the bone most likely to sustain a fracture is the keel bone, which can be damaged in two main ways: i) by misjudged landings when birds are perching or nesting in a furnished environment; or ii) when birds are handled during depopulation at the end of lay. The incidence of keel fractures caused by furnishings is higher in non-cage systems than in cage systems. In free-range and single- tier aviary systems (barns), the mean prevalence of bone break- ages is 65 percent, 90 percent of which are keel bone breaks (Wilkins et al., 2004). These findings are of particular importance in the EU, where conventional cages are being banned in 2012. However, the incidence of new breaks - those caused during de- population - is higher in conventional cage systems than in other systems. This may be attributed to weaker bones in caged birds, due to lack of exercise. Access to the birds within the cage (i.e., the size of the aperture) and the manner in which the birds are withdrawn from the cage during depopulation are critical factors in determining bone breakages. behavioural restriction In 1999, the EU introduced the Laying Hens Directive, stating that all hens must be housed in an enriched environment from 2012 onwards. This has involved the introduction of furnished cages, which will replace conventional caged systems. Furnished cages will provide birds with a nest, perches and pecking/scratching mats. A recent study comparing the physical and physiological condition of birds in four different housing systems for layers in the United Kingdom concluded that these aspects of bird welfare are better in furnished cages than in any other system (Sherwin, Richards and Nicol, 2010) The importance of providing nests, perches and pecking areas stems from the natural behaviour of chickens. In the wild, poultry have the ability to build nests, scratch and peck, dust-bath and perch. These are all behaviours that have not been lost through genetic modification of poultry breeds and they are still important for good welfare of modern-day laying hen (Weeks and Nicol, 2006). In conventional cages, it is virtually impossible for hens to perform these behaviours. Hens also need at least 600 cm 2 Varying severity of vent damage in laying hens 115 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry welfare in developing countrieseach to be able to stretch their wings and perform other comfort movements. Furnished cages do not allow birds total behavioural freedom, but they do allow birds to perform their most important behaviours to a degree not possible in conventional cages. Non-cage systems permit even greater freedom of behaviour for the majority of birds in a flock. In large flocks of hens, how- ever, some birds' access to facilities such as nests and perches is restricted by other birds, and aggression can be common. A small proportion of birds in non-cage systems can be excessively per - secuted by their flock-mates. These so-called \"pariah\" birds have extremely poor welfare. injurious Pecking Injurious pecking in laying hens is a major welfare concern that can spread through flocks, resulting in pain and high mortality. In- jurious pecking can occur in all types of layer hen housing. In cage systems persecuted birds are unable to escape, but the problem tends to be confined to particular cages. In non-cage systems, once injurious pecking starts it can spread rapidly throughout the whole flock. Injurious pecking comprises feather pecking, vent pecking and cannibalism. feather pecking Gentle feather pecking occurs when one hen pecks at the feathers of another, without pulling or removing the feathers. Severe feath- er pecking occurs when feathers are pulled violently or removed. The relationship between these two types of feather pecking is not clear, and they appear to have distinct risk factors. There may be a number of reasons for the onset of feather pecking, including deprivation of natural behaviours such as ground pecking (Roden- burg and Koene, 2004). The inability to perform behaviours can lead to long-term frustration, which may result in arousal, aggres- sion or fear. Any of these emotional states may increase the likeli-hood that a hen will start feather pecking. There are clear genetic influences on feather pecking (Rodenburg et al., 2008), and epi- demiological studies have identified a range of important environ-mental risk factors. Bald patches on hens, where feathers have been removed, encourage further pecking of exposed body tissue. This has an economic impact on production, as birds lose energy and heat and therefore consume more food. Feather pecking is likely to be very painful for the affected hens, and may lead to can- nibalism. The risks of feather pecking can be reduced by feeding mash rather than pelleted diets; providing additional foraging and fibre sources, such as chopped straw and vegetables; and ensuring good litter condition, to encourage birds to peck the litter rather than each other. Reducing light intensity is a short-term measure that does not address the cause of the problem.cannibalism Cannibalism occurs when the flesh or blood of another individ-ual of the same species is consumed. It is a common problem in poultry, particularly laying hens (Newberry, 2004). Cannibalistic behaviour may be learned by hens, and the problem can spread rapidly throughout a flock. Cannibalism can arise as a result of severe feather or vent pecking, which often occurs due to frustra- tion. Producers have attempted to reduce the incidence of feath- er pecking and cannibalism by beak trimming, which involves removal of up to two-thirds of the upper beak. This process is likely to cause pain, and does not combat the root of the prob-lem. Some producers raise birds at low light intensities so they do not have the visibility to perform cannibalism. This has not been effective however, as the increased light levels needed to inspect birds are associated with cannibalism. Beak trimming has been banned in a number of countries, so an alternative is needed. Providing birds with enrichment, such as litter to peck at, may reduce frustration. It is also important to provide pullets with litter in their rearing environment. Cannibalism is also positively corre- lated with mineral, protein and energy deficiencies, so providing all nutritional requirements may reduce cannibalism. Selection of genetic strains that are not predisposed to cannibalism should also be encouraged. vent pecking As with feather pecking, vent pecking can lead to cannibalism. Vent pecking is directed at the tissue around the cloaca (see pho- to). This may be investigative behaviour to begin with, but once established can lead to birds pecking at internal organs or tissue. The result is often death. It is therefore advantageous to prevent birds from viewing the cloacal areas of other birds, by ensuring that nesting areas are not brightly lit and that there are sensible perch arrangements. It is also important not to bring the flock into lay too early - vent pecking can be triggered when small birds are encouraged to lay large eggs too early. emaciation The metabolic demands of high egg production are great, and by the end of lay many hens show signs of emaciation, poor body condition and chronic stress. This can be minimized by ensuring that a good diet with adequate levels of nutrition is supplied to- wards the end of the laying period. avoiDing welfare Problems in hens Several sources provide advice on avoiding welfare problems in layers. These include national government codes of practice, such 116 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry welfare in developing countriesas the United Kingdom's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) code www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/ broiler-welfare/annex-g.pdf, and assurance schemes guidance, such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani- mals (RSPCA) Freedom Food scheme, which details and specifies high standards of management and provision: www.rspca.org. uk/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RSPCA/RSPCARedirect&pg=welfa restandards&marker=1&articleId=1123153964606. The following are some important practical tips for avoiding welfare problems: Avoid conventional unfurnished cages, as these cannot provide good welfare for laying hens. If using a cage system, use furnished cages with at least 600 cm 2 of floor area per bird and a nest area. Manufacturers of furnished cage systems are listed in the LayWel project de-scription of laying systems: www.laywel.eu/web/pdf/deliver - able%2023.pdf. Produce plans for preventing or coping with emergencies such as equipment breakdown or fire. Inspect flocks at least twice a day and check individual birds, even in cage systems where it can be difficult to observe indi- vidual birds at the back of a cage. At monthly intervals, catch samples of birds to look more closely for problems such as mite infestations or vent pecking. Keep good records of mortality and the causes of mortality. Record spontaneous mortality separately from culling figures. Seek veterinary advice if birds show signs of sickness. There are many links between poor welfare and poor health/disease. Improving one can often improve the other. If possible, obtain birds from rearing units close to the laying farm, as this will minimize stress during transfer. The new laying flock will settle more easily and early egg production is likely to be improved. Do not bring the flock into lay too early. Onset of lay at 17 or 18 weeks is associated with a greater risk of vent pecking than onset of lay at 19 weeks. Do not place perches at heights that permit one bird to peck another bird's vent. The use of mash rather than pelleted feed allows the hens to spend a longer time feeding, and reduces the risk of injurious pecking. The provision of good, dry litter to a depth of at least 10 cm is vital for the good management of hens in non-cage systems. For birds in non-cage systems, provide a raised slatted or wire mesh area separate from the litter area. Do not provide high perches, which are associated with \"crash-landings\" and sub- sequent bone fractures. In non-cage flocks, the risk of injurious pecking can be reduced by ensuring that the litter area is kept dry and friable. Add fresh litter regularly and, if possible, provide hens with additional pecking materials, such as straw or other dry vegetation. If the birds have access to an outdoor range area, encourage them to go outside as much as possible, by providing areas of shelter (from sun or rain) on the range. This reduces the risk of injurious pecking in the flock. Birds should have at least eight hours of light and at least six hours of dark in every 24-hour period, and light levels should not be less than 10 lux. In non-cage systems, consider provid-ing brighter light over the litter areas, to encourage birds to for - age and dust-bath, and lower light levels near the nest boxes and perches, to reduce the risk of vent pecking. references efsa. 2005.

General issues of health and disease are considered elsewhere (see review on Poultry Health and Disease Control in Developing Countries). leg health The incidence of leg disorders is a major issue in broiler produc- tion and often leads to lameness. The most recent large-scale study in the United Kingdom found that 27.6 percent of the birds assessed close to slaughter age showed poor locomotion, and 3.3 percent were almost unable to walk (Knowles et al., 2008). These figures arose even though the participating farms had good cull- ing procedures, with severely lame birds identified and killed humanely to avoid further suffering. A similarly high prevalence of lameness has been found in other studies around the world over the past 15 years. Assuming the worldwide prevalence of leg disorders is similar to that in the United Kingdom this equates to 12.5 billion broilers experiencing leg problems worldwide per year. Although breeding companies are directing far more atten- tion and resources to finding ways of selecting against leg disor - ders, negative correlations with meat yield can sometimes hinder progress. There are several causes of lameness in broiler chickens, broad- ly divided into infectious and developmental causes, although the two are interrelated. One of the main factors contributing to both types of leg problems is genotype. Through intensification of production and genetic selection over the last 50 years, broiler growth rates have increased from 25 g per day to 100 g per day - a 300 percent increase. Owing to the rapid growth of broiler chickens, it is possible for them to reach slaughter weight at less than 40 days of age. The problem is that this rapid growth places stress on the skeleton, resulting in skeletal abnormalities. Rapid growth can result in valgus varus deformation, ruptured tendons, separation of the proximal epiphysis, bending and rotation of the tibia, osteochondrosis, degenerative bone disease and micro- fractures. It has also been demonstrated experimentally that rapid growth increases the risk of a range of infectious leg conditions including arthritis and tenosynovitis. Generally, the risk of lame- ness increases rapidly with bird age, up to the point of slaughter. The innervation of chicken legs is similar to that in humans, so leg disorders may be painful to poultry (European Commission, 2000) and some causes of lameness may be associated with more pain than others. When birds are given analgesic (pain-killing) drugs, their walking ability generally improves. In addition, one study showed that lame birds preferentially select food containing an analgesic drug, a feeding pattern not observed in non-lame birds, which suggests that birds might actively seek to control their own pain levels. Environmental and management factors that increase the risk of chickens developing lameness include diet, lighting regime and antibiotic use (Knowles et al., 2008). It is also generally accepted that stocking density has an effect on lameness, although there is conflicting evidence. Dawkins, Donnelly and Jones (2004) report that other environmental and management factors such as air and litter quality within the house may have more of an effect on bird welfare than stocking density. Nonetheless, high stock- ing density does seem to exacerbate other welfare problems, and the EU Broiler Directive (2007) sets limits on stocking density for farms where leg health problems are apparent. Lameness is not the only leg problem affecting broiler chickens. Contact dermatitis (pododermatitis) appears to be increasing in prevalence in some countries. Signs of contact dermatitis include the appearance of lesions, ulcers or scabs on the footpads (see photo), hocks or breast. In severe cases, extensive areas of skin may turn black. This results from these parts of the birds' bod- ies being in prolonged contact with irritant substances derived from faeces, such as ammonia. Lesions can act as a gateway for bacteria, which may spread through the bloodstream and cause joint inflammation. metabolic DisorDers There are a number of problems associated with poultry metabo-lism, and they often have a genetic cause. The major issues result from a very high metabolic rate, efficient feed conversion and rapid growth. Rapid growth places pressure on poultry's internal organs. This can lead to cardiovascular diseases, the most preva- lent of which are ascites and sudden death syndrome. Ascites is the accumulation of fluid in the lungs and abdomen caused by 118 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry welfare in developing countriesdeficiency of the cardio-pulmonary system in adequately oxygen- ating the blood pumped through the large muscle mass of the modern-day broiler chicken. This can result in right-side ventricu- lar failure. The condition appears to be more prevalent at high altitudes, although it affects birds worldwide. In 1996, a world- wide survey estimated the incidence of ascites in broilers to be approximately 4.7 percent. Selection based on oximetry or serum levels of cardiac-derived Troponin-T has reduced the incidence of ascites in broiler flocks in recent years, but it is still an important cause of loss, accounting for up to 50 percent of total mortality in commercial flocks of birds reared to 42 days . hunger in broiler breeDers When considering the welfare of broilers it is important to con-sider all stages of production. The welfare of broiler breeders is often compromised by routine feed restriction. To compensate for the negative effect of selection for growth rate on reproductive performance, food is restricted during both the rearing and the laying phases to prevent birds from becoming too fat and heavy, which would compromise egg production and fertility. These birds are almost certainly experiencing extreme hunger, at least during the rearing phase, when they are often given less than half of their voluntary food intake avoiDing welfare Problems in broilers Several sources provide advice on avoiding welfare problems in broilers. These include national government codes of practice, such as the United Kingdom's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) code www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/con- sult/broiler-welfare/annex-g.pdf, and assurance schemes guid- ance, such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) Freedom Food scheme, which details and speci- fies high standards of management and provision (www.rspca. org.uk/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RSPCA/RSPCARedirect&pg= welfarestandards&marker=1&articleId=1121442811407). The following are some important practical tips for avoiding welfare problems: Demand good stock from hatcheries, and contact the breeding companies if leg health problems are experienced. Produce plans for preventing or coping with emergencies such as equipment breakdown or fire. Inspect flocks at least twice a day, and check individual birds. Check that all birds can move freely with gait scores of less than 3 (gait scores are described in Knowles et al., 2008). Check that there are no signs of breast or leg lesions. Such symptoms are usually associated with wet and dirty litter. If le- sions are apparent, take steps to improve litter condition and ventilation. Keep basic records detailing the number of birds in the house, maximum and minimum temperatures, etc. Keep good records of mortality and the causes of mortality. Record spontaneous mortality separately from culling figures. Birds that cannot move sufficiently well to have easy access to feed and water should be culled, as they are unlikely to recover and culling will prevent them from experiencing further suf- fering. Manage the litter, keeping it as dry and friable as possible. Do not allow ammonia levels to rise too high. Consider topping up the litter frequently, to allow birds to rest and dust-bath and to minimize the risk of skin lesions and ulcers. Avoid high stocking densities, as these are associated with de-pressed health and welfare. Providing perches at a height of 10 to 30 cm above the floor can improve leg health. Allow a minimum of 2 m of perch length per 1 000 birds. Average growth rates of more than 45 g per day from hatch to slaughter may be associated with welfare problems. Ensure that birds have a period of darkness in each 24-hour period, to allow them to rest. Make sure that wild birds, cats, dogs or rodents cannot enter the chicken house. Check for the appearance of panting, which may indicate that the birds are too hot. Good ventilation is essential. In hot cli-mates, consider roof insulation as a way of reducing the impact on birds. Ensure that the house is thoroughly cleaned and disinfected between flocks. references Dawkins, m.s., Donnelly, c.a. & jones, t .a. 2004.

In some ways, this system is better for welfare, as it does not require large- scale depopulation and transport. Birds can usually be caught from their night-time enclosures. Depopulation on a larger-scale usually takes place during the night, when birds are easier to catch and therefore do not become as stressed by the process. Most large producers are responsible for providing both the catching team and the transportation for the birds. Catching teams are required to grasp large numbers of birds quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, this often involves handling them incorrectly. The preferable method for handling chickens is to catch both legs simultaneously, to avoid hip disloca- tions and broken bones. However, owing to the speed at which the catching team works, it is usual for only one leg to be caught, which often results in painful leg dislocations. Birds are usually inverted when caught, so that many may be held in each hand simultaneously. This does not provide optimal bird welfare, as birds prefer to be held upright. These processes are likely to cause pain (Weeks, 2007) to the birds, so it is important that they are handled as carefully as possible to minimize the risk of damage. Techniques are being developed for avoiding excessive han- dling of birds during depopulation. Automated \"broiler harvest- ers\" are large machines that depopulate broiler houses rapidly, by picking up chickens using revolving rubber fingers. Trials have demonstrated that they may halve the risk of catching damage to the legs (Weeks, 2007), but they can only be used in large clear-span houses. Similar good results can be achieved if birds are caught using gentle and correct handling techniques. Cage systems for laying hens present special problems during depopulation, and injury and damage levels can be high, as birds have to be removed from the cage fronts. In the EU, attempts have been made to improve cage design so that birds can be removed more easily through the whole cage front, rather than through narrow gaps; this has resulted in a reduced incidence of broken bones sustained at the end of lay. transPort In developing countries, there are three main methods for slaugh- tering birds. The system in which they are reared determines whether and how they will be transported. Backyard village poul- try are often slaughtered by their keepers, within the home envi- ronment, which does not require transportation. Larger producers however transport birds to either a \"wet\" market or a commer - cial abattoir. The range of transportation to each varies among countries and regions. In general, birds that are slaughtered in abattoirs are transported from the farm in large loose-crates or on modulated lorries, similar to those used in the EU. The stocking density is usually very high, as few legal guidelines exist. This pos- es a problem, particularly in very hot countries, where many birds may die of heat stress. A major welfare issue with this method of transport is the movement of birds from a controlled (relatively stable) environment to a lorry, which may provide birds with little protection from extreme climates. In many developing countries, there is demand for fresh meat, and animals are often killed at markets in the presence of the consumer. Worldwide, billions of people buy their poultry at \"wet\" markets, many of which are unlicensed. Birds are often transported under stressful conditions. Small producers may uti- lize what little transport they have by tying poultry to the back of their bicycles or motorcycles, often in an inverted position, thus causing a high degree of stress. slaughter In large commercial abattoirs, chickens are generally stunned be- fore being slaughtered. A stunning process causes immediate loss of consciousness, which lasts until death. Stunning in poultry is usually performed by passing an electric current across the brain, disrupting normal electrical activity and causing a loss of con- sciousness (HSA, no date). This enables them to be killed without feeling the pain associated with the slaughter process. In large abattoirs, poultry arrive on lorries and are often kept in a lairage (holding area) before being killed. In extreme climates, this can be very stressful as birds are densely stocked and un-able to cool themselves. Many birds may die before reaching the slaughter line, often through heat stress. Not only is this bad for Highly stressfull transport of chickens120 Poultry DeveloPment review Poultry welfare in developing countriesthe welfare of the birds, the economic loss can also be extreme. Unloading takes place directly from modular or loose crates. Birds are inverted and hung on shackles by their legs. This is like- ly to cause pain, particularly for large birds, as the shackles are one-size and do not accommodate variations in bird leg size and shape. The shackles carry birds through an electrically charged water-bath stunner. It is essential that the stunner is monitored to ensure that it delivers enough electricity through the brain of each bird. Birds should be observed for the following signs of effective stunning: neck arched and eyes open; no rhythmic breathing; rig-idly extended legs; constant rapid body tremors; and wings held close to the body (HSA, no date). Following stunning, birds may regain consciousness if the brain has not been properly disabled. This makes it essential that birds are bled (by cutting the blood vessels in the neck) within 15 sec- onds after stunning. In the United Kingdom, it is a legislative re- quirement that at least one carotid artery is severed during neck- cutting. However, it is recommended that both carotid arteries and both jugular veins are severed, as death then occurs more rapidly. slaughter of village Poultry In a village environment, poultry that are not transported to be sold at wet markets are likely to be slaughtered on demand within the village. It is likely that only a few birds will be slaughtered at a time, giving the slaughterer plenty of time to ensure that each bird is killed humanely. In wet markets, however, less time may be taken over slaughtering birds, and it is likely that a number are still conscious while being killed. Unlike in commercial abattoirs, stun- ning is rare at wet markets, although it is a legal requirement in a number of countries. An alternative to the water-bath stunner is a hand-held, low voltage stunner with electrodes that are placed either side of the bird's brain, passing an electric current through it (HSA, no date); however, this has not yet been widely adopted. The methods of slaughtering poultry that are likely to be used in villages are neck dislocation, decapitation or delivering a con- cussive blow to the head (leading to loss of brain function). Al- though none of these methods provide pre-slaughter stunning, they are regularly used for emergency on-farm killing. Each of the three methods has welfare problems associated with it. If per - formed correctly, a concussive blow to a chicken's head may be the most effective way of killing it. To be effective, however, the blow must be very heavy and accurately directed to the bony part of the head, behind the comb. If delivered to any other part of the head, soft tissue may absorb some of the force of the blow, which may not result in concussion. For a concussive blow to be a reliable method of slaughter, it must be performed accurately and consistently. Neck dislocation and decapitation must also be performed correctly to be effective methods of slaughter. Of the two, de-capitation may be the more reliable, as it involves severing all the arteries supplying blood to the brain (the largest of which are the carotid arteries in the neck) immediately. This gives a very rapid loss of blood pressure, and death follows shortly after (HSA, no date). Neck dislocation involves stretching the neck to dislocate the spinal cord and cause damage to the surrounding blood ves- sels (HSA, no date). The procedure can be difficult to perform correctly and consistently, and does not always concuss the brain, causing insensibility. It is therefore not recommended as a rou-tine method of slaughter (HSA, no date). As with the commercial slaughter of poultry, bleeding should be carried out immediately after either neck dislocation or producing concussion, to ensure that the birds are killed. references hsa. no date.
