The health of your body and mind are so intertwined and connected that it makes sense to treat both of them together. You will find many Ayurvedic treatments to address the health and well-being of your mind, through fragrant oils and spices, Ayurvedic massages, steam baths, nutritious meals, daily yoga, and meditation. What you learn during your retreat you can take back with you to your daily life. It is a great experience for healing yourself both short-term and long-term. While many people tend to search for yoga retreats according to a specific type of yoga style, such as vinyasa flow, restorative yoga, yin yoga, ashtanga yoga, hatha yoga, or yoga nidra, that is not really possible with an Ayurveda yoga retreat. According to the principles of yoga, there is no one-size-fits-all yoga practice or yoga class. Every yoga pose or posture directly impacts our doshas, or the energies running through our bodies. One yoga pose could be helpful to you and be incredibly agitating to another person. So you're Ayurveda and yoga retreat will likely be a totally customized experience. Ayurveda is an ancient healing system that relies on the mind-body connection to improve the health and well-being of the individual. The two guiding principles of Ayurveda are that the mind and the body are intertwined, one and the same, and that there is nothing more powerful in healing the body than the mind. Ayurveda treatments are based on these principles and will include meals, massages, Ayurvedic medicine, yoga and meditation. An Ayurvedic doctor will determine a treatment plan by looking at the three doshas. Depending on which dosha(s) is most present, the ayurvedic treatment plan will be customized. One of the basic principles of Ayurveda is based on the three doshas. These are the energies that we all carry, with one dosha typically being the most present, and manifests in a physiological form. The vata dosha is made up of the energy that controls autonomic processes in the body, such as blood circulation, breathing, blinking, and heartbeat. When the vata dosha is in balance, creativity will flow and your life force energy will be strong. However, when it is out of balance there will be anxiety and fear. The pitta dosha is the energy system that controls all of the metabolic systems of the body, such as digestion, absorption, and temperature. When the pitta dosha is in balance, you are functioning at your most sharp and intelligent self and you are content. When it is out of balance, a fiery rage builds and ulcers form. The kapha dosha is responsible for body growth and delivering water to the body. It is also responsible for maintaining the immune system. When it is in balance, your skin is hydrated and you are loving and forgiving. When it is out of balance, you are insecure and envious. While we all carry the energies of each dosha, one is usually more prominently out of balance than the others. An Ayurvedic treatment plan created by an Ayurvedic doctor will address the imbalance in hopes of restoring balance. There are many Ayurvedic doctors all over the world that can provide you with a wonderful treatment plan, but imagine having one built right into your healing and luxurious yoga vacation. Have your yoga session on a deck overlooking the tropical jungle before you and a steam bath to relax your muscles afterward. Enjoy Ayurveda treatments, such as massages or acupuncture, with the in-house staff. It is a truly great experience that will improve your health and well-being for years to come.
