Catholic doctors in Kenya reject Covid-19 vaccines, repeat false claims in statement The Kenya Catholic Doctors Association recently issued a press statement discouraging people from getting Covid-19 vaccines, calling them \"unnecessary\" and \"unsafe\". The press release, however, was wrong on a number of points, including claims that steam and hydroxychloroquine can treat Covid-19. The document also punted population control conspiracies; AFP Fact Check has previously debunked these and other claims. The World Health Organization (WHO) dismissed the statement and assured the public that the vaccines were safe.

David Icke interview resurfaces with multiple false claims about Covid-19 A video of British author David Icke talking about Covid-19 has been viewed millions of times since it was first published in April 2020, and recently picked up steam again on social media. The hour-long clip shared on Facebook is from a longer video, since removed from YouTube. In the clip, Icke, who is known for promoting conspiracy theories, presents himself as a researcher and claims that the Covid-19 pandemic was orchestrated by supernatural forces attempting to \"dismantle\" the world economic system and \"control\" the population using new technologies like 5G. But this popular conspiracy theory is based on false and misleading claims, as several experts told AFP Fact Check.

Post falsely claims Johnson & Johnson didn't update public after vaccine trial volunteer fell ill A Facebook post claims that vaccine maker Johnson & Johnson has failed to update the public on why \"volunteers\" fell ill during the trials of its Covid-19 shot in 2020, an event that brought a temporary halt to clinical testing. This claim is misleading; only one trial participant reportedly fell sick, and while the illness remains unexplained, the company released a statement of its findings in October 2020 that ruled out the vaccine as a cause.

Facebook posts falsely report 'arrest' of discredited US researcher who featured in 'Plandemic' video Multiple Facebook posts shared in February 2021 claim police have detained discredited US researcher Judy Mikovits for \"discovering evidence that deadly retroviruses are transmitted through vaccines\". This is false: Mikovits has not been arrested in 2021. She was arrested and briefly jailed in 2011 for unlawfully taking data from her former employer, court documents show. The charges against her were dropped in 2012, according to US media reports. A 2009 study she co-authored on retroviruses did not focus on vaccines and was retracted.

The posts contain a screenshot of an article that purports to report on a WHO press conference held on January 22, 2021. The claim is false: as of February 4, 2021, the WHO recommends that people should wear face masks during the pandemic, as well as adhering to social distancing guidelines and washing their hands regularly. The screenshot in the misleading posts shows an article published on January 25, 2021 that was later updated to include the WHO's latest advice, outlining how wearing face masks can provide some protection from the coronavirus for the general population.

A new variant of the coronavirus caused South Africa's second Covid-19 wave, not face masks A Facebook post claims that the second wave of Covid-19 in South Africa was caused by people wearing masks rather than the coronavirus pathogen itself. The post relies on a video that purports to simulate a carbon dioxide test, but experts dismissed the demonstration as inaccurate, reaffirming that masks are safe to wear and they remain one of several recommended preventative measures against the disease. The latest Covid-19 surge in the country was caused by a new variant of the coronavirus.

The claim is false; the NIH confirmed to AFP Fact Check that there is not yet enough data to \"recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19\" in the US.

The claim is false: the British woman pictured in the posts received a Covid-19 vaccine in England in December 2020, according to a Getty Images photo.

The claim is misleading; in April 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that COVID-19 is \"10 times more deadly than swine flu\"; health experts say COVID-19 has a higher death rate than swine flu, which could in turn put more pressure on healthcare systems.
