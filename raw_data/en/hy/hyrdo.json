What's on this page Is the AstraZeneca vaccine still being used in the UK? No, the UK government is not ordering future supplies of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. Evidence shows that mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna, are more effective at boosting protection from Covid-19, so these vaccines are being recommended for the seasonal booster programme. The Novavax vaccine has also been approved for people who can't have mRNA-based vaccines due to allergies. What side effects can the AstraZeneca vaccine have? While the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is no longer being offered in the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) still monitors potential side effects from this vaccine. The vast majority of side effects that have been reported for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine are mild and short-term. The most common side effects are: discomfort at the injection site, or feeling generally unwell, tired, or feverish, or a headache, feeling sick or having joint or muscle pain. Can the AstraZeneca vaccine cause blood clots? There have been rare reports of people developing blood clots in combination with low platelet levels (thrombocytopenia), after receiving a dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca in the UK. This is listed as a 'very rare' side effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In April 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confirmed a [possible link between the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-issues-new-advice-concluding-a-possible-link-between-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-and-extremely-rare-unlikely-to-occur-blood-clots) and these rare blood clots, but emphasised that the benefits of the vaccine continued to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. The cases of blood clots that the MHRA reviewed were accompanied by abnormally low levels of platelets in the blood. Platelets are involved in blood clotting, and these abnormally low levels can be a sign that your body's normal clotting mechanisms are not working properly. Some of the blood clots were an unusual type of blood clot in blood vessels that drain blood from the brain called a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Why might these rare blood clots happen? [Research from Cardiff University and Arizona State University](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abl8213), published in December 2021, found a possible explanation of the link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots. They discovered that the adenovirus in the vaccine (which is used to deliver genetic instructions to the cells) can bind with a protein found in the blood, called platelet factor 4. They think that in extremely rare cases, this may trigger a chain reaction in the immune system, which could result in blood clots developing. More research still needs to be done in this area. The study authors hope that scientists will be able to build on these findings to reduce the risk of these extremely rare side effects, as well as informing the development of future vaccines. Study shows risk of blood clots is far greater from coronavirus than the vaccine [A study by the University of Oxford](https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1931) shows that having Covid-19 puts you at a much higher risk of developing dangerous blood clots than the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines. The study, based on the health records of 29.1 million people in England, suggests while there is a slightly increased risk of developing low platelet levels and blood clots in the veins after a first dose of AstraZeneca, being infected with the virus raises this risk much more, and for longer. The researchers estimate that for every 10 million people who are vaccinated with AstraZeneca, there are 66 extra cases of blood clots in the veins and seven extra cases of a rare type of blood clot in the brain. Infection with Covid-19 is estimated to cause 12,614 extra cases of blood clots in the veins and 20 cases of rare blood clots in the brain. This research is more evidence that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks for most people. Does the AstraZeneca vaccine cause stroke? There have been a very [small number of reports](https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/first-reported-cases-of-clots-in-large-arteries-causing-stroke-following-covid-19-vaccination/) of young adults under the age of 45 having a stroke within a month of having the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Ischaemic strokes are the most common type of stroke - they are the kind caused by a blood clot that blocks the arteries that provide oxygen and blood to the brain. We don't know whether these strokes were caused by the vaccine, but we do know that they are very rare. Even if a link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and stroke was proven, it's important to remember that the chance of having a stroke due to the vaccine is extremely low, and that stroke is more common in people who get Covid-19.
