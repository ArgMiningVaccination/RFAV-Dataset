It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page. I. INTRODUCTION This guidance describes the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's (CDER's) current thinking on appropriate development plans for botanical drug s to be submitted in new drug application s (ND As) and specific recommendations on submitting investigational new drug applications (INDs) in support of future NDA submissions for botanical drugs . In addition, t his guidance provides general information on the over -the-counter (OTC) drug monograph system for botanical drugs . Although this guidance does not intend to provide recommendations specific to botanical drugs to be marketed under biologics l icense a pplications (BLAs), many scientific principles described in this guidance may also apply to these product s. This guidance specifically discusses several areas in which, due to the unique nature of botanical drugs, the Agency finds it appropriate to apply regulatory policies that differ from those applied to nonbotanical drugs , such as synthetic, s emi-synthetic, or otherwise highly purified or chemically modified drugs , including antibiotics derived from microorganisms . Because t his guidance focuses on considerations unique to botanical drugs , policies and recommendations applicable to both botanica l and nonbotanical drugs are generally not covered in this document ; readers should refer to other FDA guidance documents for appropriate information . This guidance replaces the G uidance for I ndustry on Botanical Drug Products issued in June 2004. 2 The general approach to botanical drug development has remained unchanged since that time; however, based on improved understanding of botanical drugs and experience acquired in the reviews of NDAs and INDs for these drug s, specific recommendations have be en modified and new sections have been added to better address late-phase development and NDA submission for botanical drugs . 1 This guidance has been prepared by a working group c omposed of staff from the Office of Pharmaceutical Quali ty, Office of New Drugs , Office of Translational Sciences, and Office of Medical Policy in the Ce nter for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration. 2 In the Federal Register of August 2015 (80 FR 49240), we issued and sought comment on a draft guidance that revised Botanical Drug Products . This guidance finalizes the August 2015 draft guidance \u2014also entitled Botanical Drug Development \u2014and replaces the June 2004 final guidance. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 2 In general, FDA 's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency 's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. II. BACKGROUND For the purposes of this document, the term botanicals means products that include plant materials, algae, macroscopic fungi, and combinations thereof. It does not include: Products that contain animals or animal parts (e.g., insects and annelids) and/or minerals, except when these are a minor component in a traditional botanical preparation (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine) . Materials derived from botanical s pecies that are genetically modified with the intention of producing a single molecular entity (e.g., by recombinant DNA technology or cloning). Products produced by fermentation of yeast, bacteria, plant cells, or other microscopic organisms, including plants used as substrates, if the objective of the fermentation process is to produce a single molecular entity (e.g., antibiotics, amino acids, and vitamins). Highly purified substances, either derived from a naturally occurring source (e.g., paclitaxel) or chemically modified (e.g., estrogens synthesized from yam extracts). If the botanical material is derived from traditional cultivation or breeding techniques (e.g., not genetically modified ), or if fermentation of a botanical raw material is part of th e manufacturing process to produce a product that is a natural mixture consisting of multiple active constituents , 3 then appropriate provisions in this guidance will apply. When a drug product contains a botanical drug substance in combination with either a (1) synthetic or highly purified drug or (2) biotechnology -derived or other naturally derived drug, this guidance can generally be applie d to the botanical portion of the product. III. GENERAL REGULATORY APPROACHES A botanical product may be classifie d as a food (including a dietary supplement ), drug (including a biological drug), medical device, or cosmetic under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act ). Whether an article is a food, drug, medical device, or cosmetic depends in large part on its intended use , 4 though for some product types, other factors must also be considered.5 3 Active constituents are the chemical constituent(s) in a botanical drug substance that contribute significantly to a botanical drug's intended pharmacological activity or therapeutic effect. 4 See 21 USC 321(f)(1), (g)(1)(B) and (C), (h)(2) and (3), (i), See, e.g., 21 USC 321(f), 321(ff). Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 3 Intended use is established by , among other things, the product's labeling, advertising, and the circumstances surrounding its distribution.6 A botanical product intended for use in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease would meet the definition of a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act and would be subject to regulation as such. A botanical product intended to prevent disease would also g enerally meet the definition of a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B ) and be regulated as a drug . Under certain circumstances, however, an article that meets the definition of a drug would nevertheless be subject to a different regulatory scheme. For example, when a conventional food or dietary supplement bears a health claim about reducing the risk of a disease and the claim is made in accordance with an authorizing regulation issued under section 403(r) (1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 USC 343(r) (1)(B)) , such a product would not be regulated as a drug solely because its labeling contains such a claim. The recommendations in this guidance are only for botanical products that are subject to regulation as drugs . A. Marketing of Botanical Drugs U nder OTC Drug Monograph s Any drug that does not fall within the definition of a prescription drug in section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act is a nonprescription or OTC drug. A botanical drug that has been marketed for a material time and to a material extent for a specific OTC indication may be eligible for consideration in the OTC drug monograph system. 7 Currently, several botanical drug substances (e.g., psyllium and senna) are included in the OTC drug review , and witch hazel is currently marketed under an OTC drug monograph. To be included in an OTC drug monograph, a botanical drug must generally be recognized as safe and effective based on the standards for safety and effectiveness set forth in 21 CFR 330.10(a)(4) . A request to amend an OTC drug monograph to inc lude a botanical drug substance may be submitted by a citizen petition in accordance with 21 CFR 10.30 and 330.10(a)(12) or a Time and Extent Application (TEA) in accordance with 21 CFR 330.14. 8 To be included in an OTC drug monograph, a botanical drug substance must be recognized in an official Uni ted States Pharmacopeia and National Formulary (USP-NF) drug monograph that sets forth its standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity.9 Therefore, a request for a botanical drug substance to be included in an OTC drug monograph should include a reference to the applicable USP -NF drug monograph. In the absence of such a USP -NF drug monograph, the request should include a proposed standard for inclusion in an article to be recognized in an official USP -NF drug monograph, as described in 21 CFR 330.10(a)(2). Considering the complexity of botanical drugs, there are challenges to this approach. Interested parties (e.g., a botanical drug manufacturer ) 6 See 21 CFR 201.128. 7 See 21 CFR Part 330. 8 21 CFR 330.14 sets forth criteria and procedures by which OTC drugs initially marketed in the United States after the OTC drug review began and OTC drugs without any U.S. marketing experience can be considered in the OTC drug monograph system. Basic information to be provided in the TEA includes a detailed description of the botanical drug substance, as set forth in 21 CFR 330.14(c)(1)(ii). 9 See 21 CFR 330.10(a)(2) and 330.14(i). Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 4 should contact the Division of Nonprescription Drug Products in CDER's Office of New Drugs /Office of Drug Evaluation IV for additional information about the OTC drug monograph approach to marketing a botanical drug. B. Marketing of Botanical Drugs Under NDAs Any person who wishes to market a new drug in the United States must submit an NDA and obtain Agency approval prior to market ing the new drug product for the proposed use ( see sections 201(p) and 505 of the FD&C Act). FDA may approve a drug product containing such a drug substance for OTC sale pursuant to an application submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act . Accordingly, an applicant could seek marketing approval for a botanical drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act for either prescription or OTC use.10 Because of the heterogeneous nature of a botanical drug and possible uncertainty about its active constituents, one of the critical issues for botanical drugs is ensuring that the therapeutic effect for market ed drug product batches is consistent . In general, therapeutic consistency can be supported by a \" totality of the evidence \" approach, including the following considerations : Botanical r aw material control (e.g., agricultural practice and collection ). Quality control by chemical test (s) (e.g., analytical t ests such as spectroscopic and/or chromatographic methods that capture the active or chemical constituents of a botanical drug substance ) and manufacturing control ( e.g., process validation) . Biological assay (e.g., a biological assay that reflects the drug's known or intended mechanism of action ) and clinical data ( for details regarding use of clinical data in ensuring therapeutic consistency , see Section V I.F.1 of this guidance under Study Design for Mu ltiple Batch Analyses and Section V I.F.2 of this guidance under Dose -Response Effect ). Section VI I of this guidance describes recommendation s for submi tting NDAs , including instructions for submitting information to support therapeutic consistency for botanical drug products, and discus ses post -marketin g issues for botanical drug product s. IV. BOTANICAL DRUG DEVELOPMENT U NDER INDS To develop information to support either an NDA or an OTC monograph for a botanical drug , interested parties may need to develop data by, among other things, conducting clinical investigations . Section 505(i) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR P art 312 require clinical investigations in which a drug is administered to human subject s to be conducted under an IND (unless exempt under 10 See section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 5 \u00a7 312.2(b)) . To determine whether a proposed study would be exempt from the IND requirements , a sponsor11 (or sponsor -investigator of an individual investigator -initiated study) should consult the Guidance for C linical I nvestigators, S ponsors, and I nstitutional R eview Boards on Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) \u2014Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND .12 If a sponsor is uncertain, we r ecommend that the sponsor contact the appropriate Office of New Drugs (ON D) review division for advice about whether the IND regulations apply. Pre-IND, e nd-of-phase 1, e nd-of-phase 2 and 2A, pre-phase 3 , and pre -NDA consultations13 are strongly encouraged for the sponsor of a botanical drug to assess the adequacy of existing information for an IND submission or a n NDA, obtain advice regarding the need for additional studies, ensure that clinical protocols are properly designed, and allow discuss ion of the initial or overall development plan. The s ponsor should submit all available information to the appropriate OND review division in accord ance with the content and format requirements outlined below. The format and content requirements for IND submissions are provided in \u00a7 312.23 and discussed in several FDA guidance documents.14 In general, an IND must contain sufficient information to demonstrate that the drug is safe for testing in humans and that the clinical protocol(s) is properly designed for its intended objectives. While these general requirements are applicabl e to botanical drug INDs , botanical drugs have certain unique characteristics that may affect the information necessary to be provided in an IND. B otanical drugs are generally heterogeneous mixtures . As such , their chemical constituents often are not w ell defined ; in some cases, their active constituent s are not identified and their biological activities are not well characterized. However , certain botanical drugs may have been used in humans prior to submission, which may provide some indication of their s afety. The unique characteristics of such botanical drugs could have significant impact on the ir development program (e.g., quality control and clinical study design ). Sections V and V I below provide r ecommendations for IND submissions that consider these unique characteristics . V. INDS FOR PHASE 1 AND PHAS E 2 CLINICAL STUDIES Under \u00a7 312.22(b), the amount of information that must be submitted in an IND for a particular drug depends on several factors, including the extent of prior human experience and past clinical 11 In this guidance, sponsor refers to anyone who submits an IND and applicant refers to anyone who submits an NDA. 12 CDER u pdates guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance W eb page at www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm www.fda.gov/Drugs/Guidan ceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm . 13 See the Guidance for Industry on Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants and the Guidance for Industry on End-of-Phase 2A Meetings . 14 Examples of related guidance documents include the Guidance for Industry on Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well -Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology -derived Products and the Guidance for Industry on INDs for Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 6 studies, the drug 's known or suspected risks, and the developmental phase of the drug. For example, a botanical dietary supplement marketed under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ( DSHEA) that has no known safety issues often would require less detailed information on chemistry, manufacturing, and controls ( CMC ) or toxicological data in an IND for early -phase studies than would a botanical product that is newly discovered, has not been marketed , or has known safety issues . For most botanical drug s, detailed CMC information (e.g., data on comprehensive characterization of the drug substance ) may not be warranted for early -phase development (Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies ); how ever, gathering of CMC data should be initiated during these phases because such preliminary information should be submitted prior to initiating Phase 3 studies . Every botanical drug has unique considerations, and the Agency encourages a sponsor to seek input from the appropriate OND review division before formally submitting an IND . We recommend that the clinical development of a botanical drug take a stepwise approach so that raw material control considerations, analytical characterizati on data, and early -phase study results can assist in the design of late -phase studies . However, botanical drug substance s used in various stages of development may differ in some characteristics (e.g., c hemical composition ), as there could be possible changes in agricultural practice and collection for botanical raw material(s) and/or manufacturing process conditions as a result of process optimization. Therefore, bridging studies may be needed to justify these differences . The s ponsor should request input from the appropriate OND review division so the review division can evaluate any changes in the botanical drug substance during development and provide guidance (e.g., on the type of bridging studies that may be needed) . To comply with the requiremen ts outlined in 21 CFR 312.23, the sponsor should specifically address the following issues unique to botanical drug s in the IND submission. We recognize that some aspects of the foll owing quality control strategy may not be completed until Phase 3 studies ; nonetheless, all available information should be provided: A. Description of Product and Documentation of Prior Human Experience 1. Description of Botanical Raw M aterials Used and Known Active Constituents or Chemical Constituents (\u00a7 312.23(a)(3)(i)) Provide t he following general information for each of the botanical raw materials used as the source of the botanical drug substance in a botanical drug product : Scientific name of the plant species according to international binomial nomenclature conve ntion, including the genus name, the specific epithet, and the name of the botanist who initially described and nominated the species . Synonyms, especially those used in recent publications of scientific studies related to the species . Subspecific rank (subspecies, variety , and form) and cultivars, if applicable . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 7 Family name . Botanical parts used (e.g., aerial parts, roots, rhizomes, flowers , and/or leaves ) as the botanical raw material(s) . Common or usual names of the plant, alga, or macroscopic fungus in English and other languages (e.g ., Chinese or Spanish), especially the languages of the region in which the species and the raw materials have medicinal or other significance. Active constituent s identified as individual compounds or chemical class es, if known. If active constituents are not known, chemical constituent s that have been identified (e.g., those can be used as a characteristic profile for identification and quality cont rol purposes ). 2. Prior Human Experience (\u00a7\u00a7 312.23(a)(3)(ii),(a)(9)) Under \u00a7 312.23(a)(9), a sponsor must submit information about pr ior human experience with the investigational drug , if available . Many botanical drugs have been previously marketed or tested in clinical studies , including clinica l studies reported in literature . Where clinical studies have been conducted, the study reports should be submitted in the IND with a critical review of the data quality and the data's relevance to the proposed use . The botanical drug 's marketing history also should be described. In particular, it should i nclude documentation of the annual sale s volume, an estimate of the size of the exposure population, and rate s of adverse effects , as well as provide r eferences to compendia and publications (e.g., books of medical practice in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, Unani, Sidha, and other herbal medicine and pharmacognosy textbooks) . For botanical drugs only available in foreign markets, the information's reliability and relevance to the proposed clinical study should be jus tified. A sponsor planning to support its IND with a well -designed and well -conducted foreign clinical study or studies not conducted under an IND should refer to \u00a7 312.120 and related FDA guidance documents . 15 Any literatu re that is submitted should be provided in English (and in its original language, if other than English) .16 In addition to a thorough review of the past human experience with the botanical drug and the drug's botanical raw material(s) , the sponsor should also present information to bridge the past experience with the current proposed investigation. This information may include a: Description of the amount of raw material or traditional preparation that is equivalent to the dose propos ed in the IND study , Comparison of the identity of the investigational botanical drug with traditional 15 Examples of related guidance documents include the Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff on FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND: Frequently Asked Questions and the Guidance for Industry on E5 - Ethnic Factors in the Acceptability of Foreign Clinical Data: Questions and Answers . 16 See \u00a7 312.23(c). Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 8 preparations described in the literature , and/ or Comparison of the clinical settings in which the drug s have been used with the setting(s) in which the y are proposed to be used. The Agency will determine the relevance of prior human experience with traditional preparations to the assessment of botanical drugs ' safety in clinical studies proposed under IND s on a case- by- case basis . B. Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls The amount of CMC information to support clinical studies conducted under an IND depends on a number of factors, including the botanical drug's marketing history and the phase of development. The use of botanical drugs in fore ign markets may provide useful human experience; however, the relevance of such experience to determining the amount of CMC information needed for early -phase clinical studies depends on the integrity of the control measures and the quality of the foreign manufactured botanical drug. Provided below is an overview of the CMC information that is recommended to support early -phase clinical studies for a botanical drug . More detailed CMC information will be need ed to proceed into late -phase clinical studies (see Section VI). 1. Botanical Raw Material s (\u00a7 312.23(a)(7)(i)) A botanical drug substance can be derived from one or more botanical raw materials of the same or different plant species . The following recommendations apply to each individual botanical raw material used. For raw material control , trained personnel should identify t he plant species , plant parts, alga, or macroscopic fungus used via methods including organoleptic, macroscopic, and microscopic examination. This identification should be done against a voucher specimen ( i.e., reference specimen). A genetic taxonomic method (e.g., DNA barcoding described in USP General Chapter <563> : Identification of Articles of Botanical Origin) may be developed at this stage. If more than one variety of a g iven species is used, each variety should be specified. The botanical raw material supplier and drug substance manufacturer for each batch should retain and store under appropriate conditions a sample of the plant, plant parts, or other botanical materials . These samples can be used to further verif y identity, if needed. The sponsor should provide the following information : Identification of the plant species, plant parts, alga, or macroscopic fungus used. A certificate of authenticity . Whether the plant species is: Determined to be endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act or the Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 9 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,17 Entitled to protection under some other f ederal law or international tre aty to which the United States is a party , and/or In a critical habitat that has been determined to be endangered or threatened . The following items for each grower and/or supplier, if available: Name and address, Description and characterization of the plant species, as well as varieties and cultivars (if applicable ), and botanical identification (macroscopic and microscopic) , Harvest location (e.g., by global positioning system (GPS) coordinates) , growth conditions, stage of plant growth at harvest , and harvest time/season , and Post-harvest processing (e.g., washing, drying, and grinding procedures ); control of foreign matter (i.e., inorganic and organic contaminants such as soil, insects, and algae/fung i); preservation procedures ; handling , transportation, and storage conditions ; tests for elemental impurities; microbial limits; tests for residual pesticides , including parent pesticides and their major toxic metabolites; and tests for adventitious toxins (e.g., aflatoxins) , foreign , and adulterants. Botanical Drug Substance (\u00a7 312.23(a)(7)(iv)( a)) The s ponsor should provide t he following information for the botanical drug substance, regardless of whether it is prepared from one or more botanical raw materials : Qualitative description of the drug substance . It should include the name, appearance, active constituent s, physicochemical properties, biological activity, and any prior clinical use of each botanical raw material used to prepare the drug substance . If the active constituent s, biological activity, and/or prior clinical use are unknown, the application should clearly state this. For a multi- plant drug substance, the application should state whether the drug substance is prepared by combining individually processed botanical drug substances or processing combined botanical raw materials. Quantitative description of the drug substance. The strength of a botanical drug substance should generally be expres sed as the absolute dry weight of a processed botanical substance. T he batch size and yield of the process relative to the botanical raw material should be provide d. W hen the active constituents or other chemical constituent s are known and measurable , the amount in which they are present in the botanical drug 17 See substance should be declared. The composition of multi- plant drug substance s, in terms of the relative ratio of the individually processed botanical drug substances or of the botanical raw materials before processing (as applicable) , should be expressed. Name and address of the drug substance manufacturer ( i.e., processor). Description of the manufacturing process . The description should include each process step (e.g., pulverization, decoction, expression, aqueous and/or ethanol extraction) , the quantity of botanical raw material, solvents, temperature and time for extraction and/or drying, and in- process controls . The yield of the process, expressed as the amount of the original botanical raw ma terial relative to the amount of the extract, should be indicated. If more than one botanical raw material is introduced to produce a multi -plant substance, the quantity of each raw material and the sequence of addition, mixing, grinding, and/or extraction should be provided. If a multi- plant substance is prepared by combining two or more individually processed botanical drug substances, a separate descri ption of the process leading to each botanical drug substance should be provided. Quality control tests performed on each batch of the drug substance, analytical procedures that were used, available test results , and proposed acceptance criteria. The quality control tests should include , but not be limited to , tests for the following attributes: Appearance. Strength by dry weight (equivalent to botanical raw material). Chemical identification for the active const ituents , if known, or the chemical constituents . 18 In general, the sponsor should use the best available analytical technology to address the issue of analytical resolution. When the resolution is inadequate in one particular method, multiple methods should be used to provide complementary data for adequate chemical identification and quantification . Quantification for the active constituents, if known, or the chemical const ituents . If several botanical raw materials are combined to produce a multi -plant substance and a quantitative determination of each individual active or chemical constituent is infeasible, a joint determination can be made for several active or chemical constituents. When multiple active or chemical constituents are known, they should be chemically characterized and their relative amounts should be defined. 18 The characteristic profile of chemical constituents can be determined based on spectroscopic and/or chromatographic methods. Examples of spectroscopic methods include ultraviolet, infrared, Fourier transformed infrared, Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 11 Biological assay. If the active constituent s are not known or quantif iable , a biological assay should be developed, prior to initiation of P hase 3 studies, to assess drug substance batch potency and activity relative to a reference standard (see Section VII.B.2.d) . - Mass balance. Methods should be developed to quantify other classes of compounds (e.g., lipids or proteins) that contribute to the mass balance of the botanical substance , prior to initiation of Phase 3 studies (see Section VI I.B.2.e) . - Tests for residual pesticides as outlined in USP <561> and for any pest icides routinely used in the countries of origin of botanical raw materials . - Tests for elemental impurities, residual solvents, and radio isotope contamination, if applicable. - Tests for m icrobial limits . - Tests for adventitious toxins, such as a flatoxins . - Available s tability data. The sponsor should develop stability -indicating analytical methods and conduct stability studies as the IND progresses. 3. Botanical Drug Product (\u00a7 312.23(a)(7)(iv)( b)) The s ponsor should provide t he following information for a botanical drug product: Qualitative description of the drug product . It should include the dosage form, route of administration, names and functions of all ingredients (e.g., botanical drug substance, other drug substance s, and excipients) , and a statement declar ing if the botanical drug substance is combi ned with other drug substances (e.g., a highly purified, biotechnology - derived , or other naturally derived drug substance ). Composition or quantitative description of the drug product expressed in terms of amount per dosage unit and amount per batch. The s ponsor should provide this information in tabular form (see example below) . Component Amount per Tablet Amount per B atch A 5:1 powdered, aqueous extract from 1:1 suspensa fruits Lonicera japonica Thunb. flowers 600 24.0 kg Excipient 1 100 mg 4.0 kg Excipient 2 10 mg 0.4 kg Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 12 Manufacturer 's certificate of analysis for the drug product or authorization for the Agency to cross -reference the manufacturer's previous submission or drug master file (DMF) for the relevant CMC information. If this information is unavailable for a foreign- marketed product, the sponsor should perform quality testing on the drug product . In addition to those tests, elemental impurities analysis and , if applicable, an animal safety test , should be performed. The sponsor should provide these test methods and results in the IND. A product sample from each batch to be used in clinical studies should be retained for possible future testing by the Agency and/or sponsor. Stability data to support the use of a botanical drug product for at least the length of the clinical study . As development c ontinues, stabil ity studies in line with International Council for Harmoni sation ( ICH) guidelines19 should continue to generate data in support of the proposed expiration dating period. Although generally discouraged, it may be permissible in unusual cases to augment levels of individual active constituents in a botanical drug product to achieve batch- to-batch consistency in the therapeutic effect. In general, this approach would only be appropriate in situations in which the active constituents in the drug substance are known and there is a substantial natural variation in the concentrations of these active constituents in the botanical raw material (e.g., due to changes in growing condit ions over time that cannot be controlled). In such cases, limited amounts of the purified active constituents could be added to meet the specification for a benchmark drug substance. The target levels for active constituents sh ould not exceed levels that occur naturally. The sponsor should consult with the Agency in advance concerning the appropriateness of augmenting levels of active constituents in a specific case and the process for determining the specification for the benchmark drug substance. 4. Placebo (\u00a7 312.23(a)(7)(iv)( c)) Use of certain botanical materials in the placebo to mask the identity of active drug may be necessary , but such botanical substances should not have any known pharmacological activity because that will make the clinical data difficult to interpret. The Agency understands that for some botanical drug s, it may be difficult to create a placebo with the identical taste, odor , and appearance of the active drug . It may be acceptable for these attributes in the p lacebo to be subtl y differen t from those of the botanical drug if the investigators and study subjects cannot differentiate the active drug from the placebo and blinding of the clinical study can be maintained. The s ponsor is encouraged to consult wi th the appropriate OND review division regarding the use of such a placebo in clinical studies. 19 See ICH Q1A(R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 13 5. Environmental Assessment or Claim of Categorical Exclusion (\u00a7 312.23(a)(7)(iv)( e)) A claim of categorical exclusion from the requirement for preparation of an environmental assessment (EA) can ordinarily be made for an IND (21 CFR 25.31(e)) ; however, additional information should be provided in the IND to support a claim for a categorical ex clusion for a botanical drug product.20 C. Nonclinical Pharmacology/Toxicology The amount of nonclinical information recommended to support P hase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studie s with botanical products will depend on the extent of previous human use and the design of the proposed clinical studies . Examples are provided below: For a botanical drug that is currently lawfully marketed in the United States as a dietary supplement, initial clinical studie s may be allowed to proceed without further nonclinical pharmacologic al/toxicological testing provi ded that the previous use is similar to the proposed use . Nevertheless, literature and other available information related to the safety of the drug s hould be provided. For a botanical drug that is not currently lawfully marketed in the United States, if it is administered using the route (e.g., topically or orally) and prepared, processed, and used according to methodologies for which there is extensive prior human experience, sufficient information may be available to support initial clinica l studies without additional nonclinical pharmacological/toxicological testing. Literature and other available information related to the safety of the drug should be provided. Regardless of whether a botanical drug is currently lawfully marketed in the United States , if the anticipated exposure in the proposed clinical studies exceeds that in the prior human use ( e.g., higher doses or a longer duration), a nonclinical pharmacological /toxicolog ical assessment is warranted to adequately address the difference between t he prior human use and the pr oposed clinical studies . For nontraditional routes of administration of a botanical drug (e.g., if a drug traditionally has been used only topically and the sponsor is proposing it be used orally), additional nonclinical pharmacological /toxicolog ical information may be warranted to support this difference before initial clinical studies may be allowed to proceed . For a new botanical drug for which extensive prior human use is not available, a more extensive nonclinical pharmacological/toxicological assessment is warranted. This 20 See the Guidance for Industry on Environmental Assessment of Human Drug and Biologics Applications (Environmental Assessment Guidance ). Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 14 assessment sh ould be similar to that for nonbotanical drug s (e.g., synthetic drugs) , and recommendations sh ould follow appropriate ICH and FDA guidances. If formal, nonclinical studies have not been performed for the IND submission, the sponsor should conduct a literature search to identify any publicly available information pertaining to the safety of the following: Final formulation of the intended commercial botanical drug product , Botanical s ubstance (s) of the drug product , and Known active or chemical constituents of the botanical substance . Under \u00a7 312.23(a)(8)(ii), an integrated summary of available data from medical and toxicological literature (e.g., Medline and Toxline ) should be submitted for review. T he following issues should be addressed in the original IND for review : General toxicity , Target organs or systems of toxicity , All data suggesting adverse genetic or reproductive effects of any constituents of the botanical substance , Relationship of dosage and duration to toxic responses , and Pharmacologi c effects reported for the whole botanical substance and its individual active constituent s. For botanical drug s that ha ve been previously marketed only outside of the United States , the sponsor should provide additional data to verify and document the safety of prior human use . D. Clinical Pharmacology Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is helpful in the design and interpretation of clinical studies . The Agency recognizes the technical challenges in determining standard pharmacokinetic measurements of systemic exposure because a botanical drug product often consist s of more than one chemical constituent and the active constituents may not be identifi ed. However, if the major active constituent(s) in a botanical product is known, the sponsor should attempt to measure the blood levels o f the active constituent (s) using a sensitive analytical method to achieve the same objectives of clinical pharmacology studies for nonbotanical drugs . Examples of these objectives are provided below : Assess drug absorption, distribution, metabolism , and excretion , Assess the dose -response or exposure -response relationship for desirable and undes irable effects , Address pharmacokinetics in specific populations (e.g., the elderly or patients with hepatic or renal impairments) , and Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 15 Provide information from in vitro studies to evaluate the potential for interactions with drugs or other botanicals ( e.g., contribution of enzymes and transporters to drug disposition, inhibition, and induction potential on drug metabolizing enzymes ), and evaluat e potential for QT interval prolongation. An approach based on a pharmacodynamic or clinical endpoint may be appropriate if no quantifiable active constituent s are available for in vivo pharmacokinetic or in vitro studies . E. Clinical Considerations The clinical evaluation of botanical drug s in early -phase clinical studies does not differ significantly from that of synthetic or highly purified drugs in such studies (see 21 CFR 314.126). Botanical drug product s currently marketed as dietary supplements under DSHEA generally would not require typical Phase 1 tolerability studies if sponsors can provide adequate justification for the relevance of the prior human use . The s ponsor s of such drug products are strongly encouraged to initiate well- controlled and more definitive clinical studies in order to explore the therapeutic effect early in the development program . If there is uncertainty about the dose selection , a clinical d ose-response study may be necessary to determine the optimal dose for Phase 3 clinical studies. As is generally the case with all drugs , safety data should be collected during the se early -phase clinical studies . If an IND of a botanical drug product includes only foreign marketing experience, no prior human experience, or known safety issues , the sponsor should provide additional early -phase clinical data before initiating larger -scale, late -phase clinical studies . To mimic the use in traditional practice, when the preparation is simple ( e.g., decoction ), botanical raw materials are sometimes dispensed at clinical study centers and subsequently prepared by patients at home. This practice should be applied cautiously in clinical studies because it may introduce potential variability to safety and efficacy data. The sponsor is encouraged to discuss this issue with the appropriate OND review division. VI. INDS FOR PHASE 3 CLI NICAL STUDIES A. General Regulatory Considerations in Late -Phase Development During the Phase 3 development, f urther ongoing characterization of the botanical drug product will ensure drug substance quality and , therefore , the validi ty and reliability of the clinical data that are generated . Given the more extensive exposure in late -phase clinica l studies , additional toxicology data are warranted to support safe human use and facilitate the design of clinical safety evaluations . This additional information should be provided regardless of prior marketing history. Batch -to-batch variations (e.g., a variation in chemical composition) are known to exist in different ba tches of the botanical drug substance s. Therefore, it would be of bot h scientific a nd regulatory interest to learn the impact of such variations on the therapeutic effect of botanical drug product s. The sponsor should consider what evidence will be needed to support that the Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 16 variations observed in botanical drug substance batches do not cause any meaningful differences in the therapeutic effect . One approach is to use multiple batches of the botanical drug product (i.e., each manufactured by using a different batch of the drug substance) in the P hase 3 clinical studies and to examine the clinical effects across these drug product batches (see S ection V I.F for further discussion) . This type of investigation would help the sponsor better understand which variations are clinically relevant, and , if clinically relevant , what range of variability can be tolerated to consistently maintain a botanical drug product's identity, efficacy , and safety . Such an improved understanding would aid in setting acceptance criteria for a clinically relevant specification . If previously available nonclinical and/or clinical data in the earlier phases of development are provided or referenced in the IND, the sponsor should provide a comparison of the investigational botanical drug product to be used in the IND and the botanical drug produc t(s) used in the referenced studies (e.g., chemical identification and quantification of active or chemical constituents in the drug substance, drug product composition and formulation) . Likewise, when the source and manufacturing process of the botanical raw material, drug substance , or drug product are changed during development, the sponsor should provide a comparison of the previous and new sources and manufacturing processes, because seemingly minor changes in the source and /or process may result in a meaningful difference in the clinical effects and raise the question about the applicability of earlier pharmacological, nonclinical, and clinical data . If there is uncertain ty about whether different batches of the drug substance are similar , bridging studies (e.g., chemical identification and quantification of active or chemical con stituents in the drug substance, biological assay, and/or other nonclinical studies ) may be warranted to demonstrate that the drug substances used in various stages of develo pment are sufficient ly similar to justify reliance on previous nonclinical and clinical testing results . Sufficient quantities of the botanical raw material and drug substance from the different batches should be retained for future chemical characterization and/or pharmacological/toxicological testing. The sponsor should also refer to Section V I.G below regarding the applicability of the fixed -dose combination rule to the investigational botanical drug. Phase 3 studies should provide pivotal support for an NDA submission. Thus, it is important that the sponsor review s section s VI and VII of th is guida nce regarding the information recommended for botanical -specific contents in a n NDA submission to ensure that the necessary information will be collected with appropriate technologies and well -designed studies during this phase. B. Description of Product and Documentation of Prior Human Experience This information should have be en submitted to the IND in support of Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies in accordance with \u00a7 312.23. S ee Section V .A of this guidance for details. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 17 C. Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls To support Phase 3 clinical studies of a botanical drug product , the sponsor should provide information under the same categories outlined in Section V .B in accordance with \u00a7 312.23; however, more detailed information should be provided to s upport these studies , as described below . 1. Botanical Raw Material To assess quality and therapeutic consistency, it is important to select representative raw material batches (i.e., r aw material from three or more representative cultivation sites or farms ) for the manufacturing of the clinical drug substance for multiple batch P hase 3 studies . The sponsor should establish large growing regions with three or more cultivation sites or farms whose location s are purposefully selected to be representative of the regions for each of the botanical raw materials following the principles of Good Agricultural and Collection Practices ( GACP ). 21 This will help reduc e the likelihood of an insufficient supply of the botanical raw material post - NDA approval. The s ponsor should provide information on additional work performed to characteriz e the botanical raw material (s) (e.g., chemical identification of each botanical raw material by a spectroscopic or chromatographic method, and authentication of each bo tanical ra w material by a DNA fingerprinting method as necessary ), updates on the quality control tests and analytical procedures applied by the botanical raw material supplier, and the proposed acceptance criteria, with the goal of working toward final development in preparation for an NDA submission. 2. Botanical Drug Substance and Drug Product For the drug substance and drug product, the sponsor should provide update s (as necessary ) on additional work conducted to improve characterization of the botanical drug and its active constituents. The sponsor should establish specifications ( with interim acceptance criteria) that can be finalized during the NDA review based on the results of Phase 3 clinical studies . In addition, pharmaceutical development of the drug substance and drug product should be well advanced so that no significant changes of the botanical raw material(s) and manufacturing processes will be needed during Phase 3 clinical studies to support the ma rketing application. For example, a robust manufacturing process for the drug substance and drug product should be established and demonstrated to ensure that the clinical study material s and the to- be-marketed material s are consistent , so bridging studies may not be necessary to support the marketing application (see S ection V) . 21 See the World Health Organization's \"WHO guidelines on good agricultural and collection practices (GACP) for medicinal plants \" at http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2003/9241546271.pdf and the European Medicines Agency's \"Guideline on Good Agricultural and Collection Practice (GACP) for Starting Materials of Herbal Origin\" at http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500003362.pdf . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 18 D. Nonclinical Safety Assessment Toxicity data from standard toxicology studies in animals should generally be provided t o support late -phase clinical studies .22 A botanical drug product in Phase 3 clinical studies will generally be assessed with the same overall nonclinical review standards as any other new drug under development in accordance with \u00a7 312.23(a)(8) . Certain changes in formulation could affect whether previously performed pharmacology or toxicology studies are applicable to the new formulation, and i n some cases may warrant the submission of nonclinical bridging studies. The sponsor should discuss all proposed formulation changes with the appropriate OND review division to determine whether the changes would warrant bridging or other types of studies. The s ponsor should c onsider t he following points when preparing a nonclinical pharmacology/toxicology development plan for a botanical drug product that is intended to be used in Phase 3 clinical studies . If questions arise during any stage of botanical drug product development, the sponsor is encouraged to consult the appropriate OND review division. 1. General Pharmacology/Toxicology In general, for late -phase clinical studies, the r ecommendations for general pharmacology/toxicology assessment of botanical drugs are no different from th ose for nonbotanical drugs .23 Doses used in toxicology studies should follow the principles in ICH M3(R2). The sponsor should reach agreement with the appropriate OND review division about the methods it plan s to use for arriving at acceptable dose levels in safety pharmacology (see ICH S7A and S7B ) 24 and toxicology studies. In principle, the highest dose used in toxicology studies should produce some measurable toxicity. This toxicity information can be used to inform safety monitoring during human studies. 2. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetic/Toxicokinetic Studies Because a botanical drug product usually consist s of more than one chemical constituent, it may be technically challenging to us e standard pharmacokinetic measurements to substantiate the systemic exposure of a botanical drug in animals. M onitoring representative chemical constituent (s) in a bota nical drug product using a sensitive analytical method can provide 22 See the ICH joint safety and efficacy guidances at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm065006.htm and the ICH safety guidances at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/Guidan ceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm065007.htm . 23 See ICH M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals . 24 See ICH S7A Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals and S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human P harmaceuticals . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 19 information regarding systemic exposure . If feasible, chemical constituents of a drug product that contribute to toxicity or pharmacology should be assessed in the pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies. The sponsor should also attempt to determine the metabolic fates of these chemical constituents. Pharmacokinetic/t oxicokinetic information collected during the toxicity studies may help the sponsor to interpret the outcome of the studies perf ormed .25 3. Reproductive Toxicology For most botanical drug product s, prior human experience may be a less reliable indicator of reproductive safety than are specialized animal toxicology studies . In the absence of documented reproductive safety data in humans or animals, reproductive toxicology studies are normally conducted per recommendations provided in ICH guide lines (same as for nonbotanical drug s).26 4. Genotoxicity Studies A complete assessment of genetic toxicity may be warrant ed prior to Phase 3 clinical studies if these assessments have not been conducted earlier . See ICH S2(R1) for the definition of a standard battery of genotoxicity tests .27 Interpretation of the resul ts of th is standard battery of tests and the determination of the need for additional tests should be no different for botanical and nonbotanical drugs . 28 5. Carcinogenicity Studies Carcinogenicity studies are typically submitted with an NDA for chronic use indications . To meet this goal , dose range finding studies and the carcinogenicity studies should generally be conducted during the IND phase. The indication and duration of the intended use of the botanical drug product will influence the need for carcinogenicity studies and their timing relative to clinical dev elopment . 29 Protocols for carcinogenicity studies should be submitted to the Agency for review under Special Protocol Assessment30 and for concurrence prior to the initiation of such studies to ensure that the dose selection and study design are acceptable. In particular, these protocols should i dentify the rationale for selecti ng the high dose for the carcinogenicity study . 31 25 See ICH S3A Toxicokinetics: The Assessment of Systemic Expo sure in Toxicity Studies and S3B Pharmacokinetics: Guidance for Repeated Dose Tissue Distribution Studies . 26 See ICH S5A Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products , S5B Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products: Addendum on Toxicity to Male Fertility , and ICH M3(R2) , supra note 2 3. 27 See ICH S2(R1) Genotoxicity Testing and Data Interpretation for Pharmaceuticals Intended for Human Use . 28 See \u00a7 312.23(a)(8)(ii)(a ). 29 See Environmental Assessment Guidance , supra not e 20. Also, see ICH S1A The Need for Long- Term Rodent Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals and S1B Testing for Carcinogenicity in Pharmaceuticals . 30 See the Guidance for Industry on Special Protocol Assessment . 31 See ICH S1C(R2) Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 20 6. Other Toxicity Studies In general, r ecommendations for special pharmacological/toxicological studies (e.g., studies that are used to identify potential biomarkers or provide mechanistic understanding ) for botanical drugs are not different from those for nonbotanical drugs . 7. Regulatory Considerations Nonclinical pharmacological and toxicolog ical studies that the s ponsor conducts as part of botanical drug development and to support safety should generally be performed in accordance with regulations governing good laboratory practices under 21 CFR P art 58. Both the botanical drug substance and drug product should be manufactured to achieve adequate batch -to-batch consistency as outlined in this guidance's CMC sections . If changes occur in the botanical drug substance or botanical drug product during clinical development, nonclinical bridging studies may be needed to comply w ith 21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(ii)( a). E. Clinical Pharmacology To support Phase 3 clinical studies of a botanical drug product , regardless of its marketing experience in the United States or other countries, the sponsor should provide the dose selection ration ale (including a description of the human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships for both efficacy and safety , if available ). This information should be provided in addition to the information recommend ed in Section V .D. It may be useful for the sponsor to perform clinical trial simulations prior to conducting Phase 3 clinical studies , if feasible . The sponsor is encouraged to meet with the Agency to reach agreement on the sponsor's planned clinical pharmacology development program s prior to P hase 3 . F. Clinical Considerations Phase 3 clinical studies of botanical drug s have the same purpose as P hase 3 clinical studies of nonbotanical drugs . Many general and therap eutic area- specific guidance documents are available on the FDA D rugs guidance web page . 32 Special considerations for Phase 3 clinical studies of botanical drugs are sum marized as follows: 1. Study Design for Multiple Batch Analyses Analyses of batch effect s on clinical endpoints (i.e., batch effect analyses ) should be considered when drug product batches exhibit var iations (e.g., a variation in chemical composition ), potentially affecting clinical outcomes . These are additional analyses beyond the standard primary efficacy analyses usually performed. Standard analyses involve comparing a control group to a treatment group composed of subjects pooled across different batches. The batches that are chosen should be representative of the marketing batches and should not be too 32 See www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 21 homogenous . The goal of these analyses is to quantify potential heterogeneity in clinical outcomes for subjects who receiv e different batches in the study . This is in principle similar to other types of subgroup analyses .33 If batch effect analyses are warrant ed, the sponsor should design cli nical studies to facilitate these analyses, pre- specify in the protocols how these analyses will be carried out, discuss with the appropriate OND review division the pre -planned models for these analyses, and present the results of these analyses in the cl inical study report. Batch effect analyses are usually exploratory , with no formal requirement of control of the Type I error rate. The remainder of this section provides more details on our recommendations for clinical study design , as well as modeling and presentation of clinical study results, to accommodate batch effect analyses. Randomization of subjects to different batches in each site is highly recommended to facilitate batch effect analyses. For instance, a study of three different batches is conceptually similar to a study with three different randomized dosage groups and one control group. If subjects are not randomized to different batches, a direct comparison of clinical outcomes in differ ent batches can be confounded by other effects. For example, if drug products supplied to any given site are only from one batch rather than from multiple batches, then a direct comparison of clinical outcomes in different batches is confounded with site e ffects on clinical outcomes. The sponsor should also ensure that subjects randomized to a certain batch group receive study drug from the same batch for the duration of the study . In situations where this may not be possible, the batch effect analyses may only be able to estimate a batch sequence effect. With regard to modeling and presentation of results from batch effect analyses, the sponsor should include summary tables and/or forest plots displaying estimates and confidence intervals of clinical o utcomes or treatment effect by batch, describe the pre- planned models used to generate these results, assess possible heterogeneity of clinical outcomes in subjects that receiv e different batches , and describe the statistical measures of heterogeneity and statistical tests of homogeneity used. In addition, the sponsor should provide a summary of the subjects' baseline characteristics by batch to explore possible imbalances in the subjects' baseline characteristics between batches and identify possible confounders of batch effect on clinical outcomes. 2. Dose -Response Effect Another approach to show that clinical response to a botanical drug will not be affected by variation s of different batche s is to demonstrate that the drug's effect on clinical outcomes is not sensitive to dose , while also demonstrating that the studied doses are more effective than placebo or control , or not inferior to active treatment. If a randomized, multiple -dose, parallel group design , Phase 3 study demonstrates a similar treatment effect across multiple doses, concerns about the impact of variability in chemical composition across batches may be diminished. Therefore, to facilitate the Agency 's evaluat ion of the effect s of dose s on clinical outcomes, the 33 See Section 5.7 of ICH E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 22 sponsor should s ummarize the results of different doses on clinical outcomes , including estimates and confidence intervals of treatment effects by dose displayed in tables and/or forest plots , in the clinical study report . 3. Clinical Studies of Botanical Drugs for Serious Conditions While extensive anecdotal human experience for some botanical drugs may exist, not knowing the active constituent(s) and/or mechanisms of action may cast doubt on the drug's presumed efficacy. Lack of scientifi cally reliable and relevant data to support efficacy may raise ethical concerns for clinical studies evaluating the botanical drug alone, especially for serious conditions. In these cases, an \"add- on to standard care versus standard care\" design is preferred to a \"stand -alone versus control\" design in clinical studies for serious conditions. However, add- on designs present the possibility of an adverse interaction between the standard of care and the botanical drug. If such an interaction is possible and strong evidence i s available to support the presumed efficacy of the botanical drug alone, alternative designs (e.g., adding a third arm of botanical drug alone) should be considered. 4. Other Study Design Issues When the rationale for developing certain botanical drug products is based on prior clinical experience in alternative medical system s (e.g., Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, Unani, Sidha, and other herbal medicine and pharmacognosy textbooks ), the sponsor may propose to incorporate traditional practice s into their clinical protocol s. For example, patients may be selected or grouped bas ed on alternative medical theory or practice and treated with specific botanical regimens accordingly, or the final dosage form may be prepared by individual patients accord ing to traditional C hinese or Indian methods . These unconventional measures should be considered individually and could be acceptable if they will help ensure or enhance the therapeutic effect for an acceptable indication and can be described and translated into practical instructions for use in the labeling for patients and healthcare providers in the U nited States . The sponsor contemplating such approach es should consult with the appropriate OND review division. G. Applicability of Combination D rug Regulations Fixed dose drug combinations (FDCs) are combinations of two or more active drugs in a single dosage form, as defined under the Fixed- Combination regulations (21 CFR 300.50 and 330.10(a)(4)(iv)). Current regulations require demonstration of the contribution toward overall efficacy and safety of each component of a combination drug product ; however, the applicability of this regulation to a botanical drug product is dependent on the type of mixture from which the drug is derived. For example , a botanical drug product derived from a single source (e.g., American ginseng root ) would not be considered a fixed combination drug product under the Fixed -Combination regulations because the entire botanical mixture generally is considered to be the active ingredient . The Agency recognizes that demonstrating each botanical raw material's contribution to safety and efficacy in a product with multiple botanical raw materials may not Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 23 always be feasible. In addition, the Agency believes that it is desirable to facilitate the development of natural source products that have been used in humans, thus the Agency has proposed revisions to the current Fixed- Combination regulations that would allow FDA to waive the combination rule requirements in certain situations. 34 For example, the proposed rule envisions that botanical drug products composed of multiple botanical raw materials in fixed ratios (e.g., from multiple parts of the same plant or from parts of different plant species) could be considered for waiver, provided that there is prior human experience for the clinical use of such a combination. Until a final rule is issued, sponsors are encouraged to discuss such approaches for a botanical drug product candidate composed of multiple botanical raw materials with the appropriate OND review division. VII. NDAS FOR BOTANICAL DRUG PRODUCT S The pre -NDA meeting is of particular importance for botanical drug product s, given their unique characteristics and considerations. The pre-NDA meeting should be held sufficiently in advance of (e.g. , more than 2 months before) the planned NDA submission to allow the applicant enough time to meaningful ly respond to the Agency 's feedback. In accordance with the Prescription Drug User Fee A ct (PDUFA V) performance goals, 35 the Agency and applicant will agree on the content of a complete application for the proposed indication(s) at the pre- NDA meeting . Agreements and discussions will be summarized at the conclusion of the meeting and reflected in the Agency's meeting minutes. Submission requirements for a n NDA for a botanical drug product are general ly no different from those for other drug product s. For instructions and advice on submi tting NDAs ( applicable to all drug products ), the applicant should refer to existing Agency regulations and FDA guidances . The applicant should s ubmit a n NDA for a botanical drug product in the Electronic Common Technical Document ( eCTD ) format . 36 Issues specific to NDAs for botanical drug products are discussed in this section. R efer to previous sections of this g uidance for details on data to be acquired and the studies to be conducted to collect such data during the IND process. A. Description of Product and Documentation of Prior Human Experience All information provided in the IND should be submitted in the NDA . Refer to S ection s V.A.1 and 2. If more recent human experience exists for the botanical drug (e.g. , based on a similar drug product marketed in foreign countries), an updated summary also should be provided in the NDA. 34 See the proposed rule \"Fixed -Combination and Co- Packaged Drugs: Applications for Approval and Combinations of Active Ingredients Under Consideration for Inclusion in an Over -the-Counter Monograph\" (80 FR 79776, December 23, 2015). 35 See PDUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals and Procedures for Fiscal Years 2013 through 2017 at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/forindustry/userfees/prescriptiondruguserfee/ucm270412.pdf . 36 For information about a Common Technical Document (CTD), see the Guidance for Industry on M4: Organization of the CTD . For information about an Electronic Common Te chnical Document, see the FDA web page eCTD Basics and Getting Started . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 24 B. Quality Control Because the drug substance's active constituent s may not be unequivocally identified, the technical challenges for quality control are to determine a botanical drug's identity and ensure its consistency of strengt h. A botanical drug product 's quality control should consider a totality -of- the-evidence approach as outlined in Sections III.B and VII.F . It should extend to the raw material (s) and may require additional measures such as biological assays and/or information on the effect of variations on clinical outcomes from a multiple batch clinical study . 1. Botanical Raw Material A botanical drug product 's quality control should start with the raw material(s) and should be described in the NDA . Specific information on medicinal plants ( e.g., verification of authenticity with morphology, m acroscopic and microscopic analysis, and chemical analysis ), agricultural practices (e.g., growing , harvesting , and storage conditions ), geographic location s, and collection and processing methods should be identified. The applicant s hould establish GACP and summarize the related procedures for each of the botanical raw materials when submitting an NDA. T he general GACP principles established by the World Health Organization ( WHO) , European Medicines Agency ( EMA ), or the regulatory body of the botanical raw material growing region should be referenced . DNA fingerprint ing may be warrant ed in cases of complicated taxonomy and when identification issues related to the botanical raw material exist. For example, if multiple related plant species have been used to produc e a particular botanical raw material, the D NA fingerprint may provide more plant -specific characteristics for identification than would other methods. In addition, the applicant should describe approaches used to minimize contamination, deterioration, and variation s. The same methods should be used to collect and process the raw material (s) for manufactur ing the botanical drug s ubstance tested during early -phase clinical studies and the drug substance tested during late -phase clinical studies. Making changes to these collection and processing methods during clinical development could change the chemical profile of the drug substance in the resulting botanical drug product and may warrant bridging studies to justify reliance of previous clinical testing results . Also s ee Section s V.A.1 and B .1. 2. Botanical Drug Substance and Drug Product a. Identity Because of inherent difficulties in characterizing all chemical constituent s in botanical drug s, establish ing their identity rel ies not only on chemical characterization of molecules in the mixture , but also on other aspects , including control of the raw material (s) at the medicinal plant level , characterization of relative potency and activity by a biological assay , and /or clinically relevant specifications based on results of the multiple batch clinical studies . Nevertheless, t he applicant should evaluate the current and emerging technologies and develop orthogonal analytical methods to provide adequate ide ntification and quanti fication of the active or chemical constituents in a botanical drug . When the active constituents are not known and the botanical mixture cannot be fully characterized , the applicant may then select a characteristic profile of Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 25 chemical constituents (which show s sensitivity to changes in the quality of the raw material(s) and/or manufacturing conditions for drug substance and product ) for identity testing. b. Chemical c haracterization The m ultiple analytical methodologies used for chemical characterization of the botanical drug should be fully described in the NDA . The NDA sh ould include all chemical tests performed to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize active or chemical constituents , as well as provide data to address mass balance. c. Manufacturing process es The applicant should provide information about all of the sites that will be used to manufacture the drug substance and drug product for commercial distribution . Changes in the drug substance's manufacturing sites should be avoided, especially during late -phase clinical development . The NDA should include full manufacturing information, including manufacturing equipment used , in-process controls , and testing. The drug substance and drug product manufacturing processes should be finalized , and in- process controls and testing should be established. d. Biological a ssay In cases where chemical testing alone may not be sufficient to ensure quality and thus therapeutic consistency, the applicant should i nclude a biological assay in the release specifications and stability protocols for the botanical drug substance and/or drug product . A b iological assay that reflect s the drug's known or intended mechanism of action is preferred. Because results from a biological assay are inherently more variable than most of the chemical assays , the batch potency and activity should be measured relative to a suitable reference standard or material; r esults should be expressed in units of activity calibrated against the reference standard or material. The applicant should incorporate system suitability criteria and quality controls to ensure that the assay will perform in a reproducible and predictable manner. At the time of the NDA submission, the applicant should appropriately validate the biological assay. At a minimum, the validation should demonstrat e accuracy, precision, specificity, linearity, and range. When the same botanical drug product is intended for multiple indications, the applicant should consult with the appropriate OND review division regarding whether it is necessary to develop a separate bio logical assay for each indication.37 37 See ICH Q6B Specifications: Test Procedures and Ac ceptance Criteria for Biotechnological/Biological Products and USP Biological Assays <1032>: Design and USP <1033>: Biological Assay Validation. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 26 e. Specification s The experience and data accumulated during the development of a botanical drug should form the basis for setting clinically relevant specifications . Analytical procedures should be properly validated. In a ddition, when multiple orthogonal methods are used, the totality of the data from all analytical procedures should be able to demonstrate the mass balance in the test sample on the basis of the differe nt classes of chemicals and, if appropriate, among the individual constituents detected within a chemical class . Analytical methods should also be sensitive to detect any differences in critical quality attributes among multiple batches. The following tests on the drug substance should be included, if possible (see \u00a7 314.50(d)(1) ): Amount by weight of each known chemical constituent and total amount of constituents in the same class , Area percentage of each unknown peak , Relative Retenti on Time (RRT) of each unknown quantifiable peak , Amounts by weight of total lipids and individual fatty acid s, Amount s by weight of total amino acids and individual amino acids , Total amount by weight of simple carbohydrates , Total amount by weight of com plex carbohydrates , Amount s by weight of total vitamins and individual vitamins , and Ash content ( see USP <561 > , Articles of Botanical Origin ). If a biological assay is needed for quality control, t he mass balance should be evaluated in conjunction with the biological assay. f. Stability The applicant should develop, validate , and use stability -indicating analytical methods and/or a biological assay to monitor the stability of the botanical drug substance and drug product. The applicant also should perform stress stability studies to identify degradation products in the drug substance and drug product , assess the potential toxicity , and provide adequate control of these degradation products . A retest period for a drug substance and a n expiration dating period for a botanical drug product should be established based on data from stability studies designed according to the scientific principles describ ed in ICH Q1A(R2) . 38 g. Drug m aster f ile CMC information about the botanical raw material and/or drug substance may be submitted as part of the IND , NDA, or a drug master file (DMF). However, if the applicant relies on information in a DMF , the applicant should have adequate acceptance tes ting (e.g., chemical 38 See ICH Q1A(R2) , supra note 1 9. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 27 identification test, content , biological assay) before accepting the raw material s and/or drug substance received from the DMF holder for further processing or for direct use in humans. h. Naming c onsideration Regulation at 21 CFR \u00a7 299.4(d) encourages the applicant to contact the United States Adopted Name (USAN) Council for designation of an established name . When deriving an established name for the botanical drug substance , the USAN Council will base its consideration on a common similar pharmacological action or common structural type for the active or chemical constituents in the mixture.39 The corresponding International Nomenclature body ( the INN Expert Committee) does not grant INNs for mixtures, so a botanical drug substance will not be granted a n INN . i. Current g ood m anufacturing practices Because of a botanical drug 's heterogeneous nature and uncertainty in its defined active constituent s, control of botanical raw materials \u2014including their storage conditions and processing methods \u2014is of particular importance in the manufacture of a botanical drug substance . The applicant should provide s ufficient information about the quality of the starting material in the application and should not rely solely on quality control of the finished product for a botanical drug product . The manufacturing of botanical drug substance should be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs). In some cases, compliance with both GACP and C GMPs may be warranted to cover the way in which the botani cal raw material is grown, collected, processed, and stored. The applicant should designate and document the rationale for the point at which product ion of the drug substance begins and is encouraged to contact the appropriate review division in the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality to reach agreement on this aspect . j. Environmental a ssessment Environmental assessment (EA) requirements for NDA approval are described in 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 25.30, 25.31, and 25.40. The Agency regards the submission of an NDA for a drug derived from plants taken from the wild as an extraordinary circumstance requiring the submission of an EA. 40 39 If a drug substance submitted to the USAN Council for naming is closely related to a compendial article ( i.e., USP/National Formulary (NF) ), compliant with the current USP/NF monograph, or purified to a different extent than required in the monograph, the USAN Council has three basic options in naming the substance: 1) Vote \"No USAN,\" stating that the substance is already compendial and has a compendial name; 2) Vote to adopt the compendial name as USAN (in some cases, the name is NF and the monograph concerns use as an inactive ingredient), and the USAN would provide an official name for the substance for use as an active drug substance; or 3) Vote to adopt a name different from the compendial name. This might be done if the origin of the botanical raw material or level of purification or manuf acturing results in a different mode of action, clinical indication, or safety, efficacy, or pharmacokinetics profile. 40 See Environmental Assessment Guidance , supra note 20. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 28 C. Nonclinical Safety Assessment Pharmacology and toxicology requirements for an NDA for a botanical drug are anticipated to be the same as those for a nonbotanical drug. S tandard guidance documents are available on the FDA D rugs guidance web page.41 The applicant should work closely with the Agency on all regulatory issues relating to pharmacology and toxicology studies needed during the IND process. Possible exceptions to normal drug development recommendations should have been initially discussed with the Agency by the end of Phase 2, and general ag reements should be reached by the end of Phase 3 studies and captured in pre -NDA meeting minutes in accordance with PDUFA V performance goals. D. Clinical Pharmacology The general requirements for in vivo bioavailability data in an NDA (described in \u00a7 320.21) are applicable to botanical drug s (see Section s V.D and V I.E). The type of bioavailability study that is appropriate for a specific botanical drug product is based on the following: (1) information on the active constituent s, if known; (2) the complexity of the drug substance; and (3) the availability of sensitive analytical methods. Because there could likely be more than one chemical constituent in a botanical drug or the active constituent s may not be identified, standard in vivo bioavailability and pharmacokinetic studies that measure the blood or urine concentration of the active moieties or active metabolites may be difficult or impossible to perform. Documentation of the methods evaluated and the reason for their abandonment should be provided. As an alternative, it may be reasonable to measure an acute pharmacological effect as a function of time using an appropriate biological assay method. Well -controlled clinical studies that establish the botanical drug's safety and efficacy may be considered acceptable for measuring bioavailability when other methods are not possible. The general criteria for granting a waiver of in vivo bioavailability data in an NDA, described in \u00a7 320.22, are applicable to botanical drug product s. The Agency may, for good cause, waive or defer the in vivo bioavailability study requirement if a waiver or deferral is compatible with the protection of the public health ( see \u00a7 320.22(e)). The applicant should refer to existing regulations and FDA guidance documents for further instructions on the format and content of the clinical pharmacology sections of NDAs. E. Clinical Evidence of Efficacy and Safety The overall requirement s for demonstrat ing a botanical drug product's efficacy and safety are the same as those for other drug product s. The applicant should refer to existing regulations and FDA guidance documents for further instructions on the format and content of the clinical sections of NDAs . See also S ection s VI.F and G. 41 See www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm . Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 29 F. Evidence T o Ensure The rapeutic Consistency One of the key challenges for manufacturers of a botanical drug product is to ensure that different market ing batches, with their variations, have the therapeutic effect consistent with those of the batches used in the Phase 3 clinical studies . Given the heterogeneous nature of botanical drug products, chemical testing alone may not be sufficient for quality control and therefore for ensuring therapeutic consistency . As outlined in S ection III.B , quality control of botanical d rug products should take into consideration the three following aspect s: (1) botanical raw material control , (2) quality control by chemical tests and manufacturing control , and (3) biological assay and clinical data. T hese different aspect s of the quality control should be viewed collectively . For example, the amount of data need ed from (1) and/or (3 ) (biological assay ) could depend on the extent to which the molecules in a botanical mixture are characterized based on the chemical testing in (2) . The applicant should provide a n integrated assessment of the above three quality control aspects to demonstrate that the commercial botanical drug product batches will have the therapeutic effect consistent with those observed in the pre -marketing clinical tes ting. The quality information should be collected from the clinical studies conducted during drug development, as discussed under different sections earlier in this g uidance. All available data should be summarized and an integrated evaluation should be presented in the NDA in a botanical drug -specific section entitled \"Assurance of Therapeutic Consistency\" under Module 2.3.P.2 (Pharmaceutical Development) . 1. Raw M aterial C ontrol Refer to Section VII.B.1. 2. Quality Control by Chemical Test s and M anufacturing C ontrol Refer to S ection V II.B.2. 3. Biological Assay(s) and C linical Data While the raw material control and other CMC measures will help establish the identity and ensure the quality of the botanical drug products, information on correlations between such quality parameters and the pharmacological activity or clinical effect may be warrant ed in certain cases to ensure that variations in raw materials and drug substance will not affect a botanical drug product's therapeutic consistency. Examples of such information are as follows: a. Biological a ssay As noted above, a biological assay is an important method by which to m easure a botanical drug's potency and activity. While the biological assay should be as closely related to the drug's presumed mechanism of action as possible, other less relevant assays may also be considered and evaluated in individual cases. Also see Section VII.B.2. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 30 b. Clinical data Dose-response data (see S ection V I.F.2) : If the clinical effects are not sensitive to dose (but are still superior to the placebo control group), it can reasonably be assumed that the variations within the established specifications probably will not affect the therapeutic consistency of drug products . Multiple batch clinical data (see S ection V I.F.1) : Clinical studies in which subj ects are randomized to receive different drug product batch es can be used to assess treatment -by-batch interaction s. Lack of significant interaction could provide confidence that therapeutic effects will be independent of drug batches within the established specification. G. Postmarketing Considerations Because of the importance of having a stable source of the botanical raw material and consistent manufacturing process for the botanical drug substance, any changes made post -approval (e.g., change in agricultural sites , agricultural and collection practice, and/or processing methods) should be assessed carefully to determine if drug product batches produced after such a proposed change would be sufficiently similar ( pharmacologically and /or therapeutically ) to batches produced before such a change. For botanical drug product s, the effect of changes may not be easily evident . Additional studies (e.g., assessment of potency and activity using biological assays and/ or other in vivo bridging studies ) may be necessary . The Agency will d etermin e the amount of data required on a case -by-case basis , taking into consideration a number of factors including, for example, the nature and extent of the changes and the extent of characterization of the active or chemical constituents in the "}
