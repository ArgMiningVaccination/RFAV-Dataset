Through its state and city mand ates, the Mental Health Board advises, reviews, advocates, and educates; with the aim of having that advice integrated, incorporated, and reflected in implementation of mental health policy; with the ultimate goal of ensuring quality mental health services. Adopted October 12, 1994 THE MISSION OF THE CALIFORNIA MENTAL HEALTH PLAN The mission of Califo rnia's mental health system shall be to enable persons experiencing severe and disabling mental illnes ses and children with serious emotional disturbances to access services and prog rams that assist them, in a manner tailored to each indi vidual, to better control thei r illness, to achieve their personal goals, and to develo p skills and supports leading to their living the most constructive and satisfying li ves possible in the least re strictive available settings. Passed as part of the Bronzan -McCorquodale Act of 1991 3 A Word From the Chair: A Year of Change This has been a year of change for Commu nity Behavioral Health Services. Jo Robinson, MFT, formerly the executive di rector of Jail Psychiatric Services, was appointed Director of Community Behavioral Health Services (CBHS) July 1, 2010. She replaced Bob Cabaj, MD who bec ame Medical Director. Then in April 2011, Dr. Cabaj left this position, and in May Irene Sung, MD, was appointed Medical Director of Community Behavioral Health Services. Ms. Robinson brought a wealth of expe rience from leading an organization that works with clients who have come into cont act with the criminal justice system as a consequence of their mental illne ss. She had been with the City of San Francisco since 1985. Ms. Robinson was part of the interdisciplinary team that founded and implemented Behavioral Heal th Court in San Francisco that provides support and services for people so that incarceration can be avoided. The program has been extremely successful. She was also one of the creators and instructors for the ten y ear long Police Crisis Intervention Training that was a collaboration between the S an Francisco Police Depar tment and Mental Health. In addition she was significantly involved with the implementation of the Mental Health Services Act, and served on the co mmittee to design the program for San Francisco. Ms. Robinson has an open door policy an d encourages open dialog. During her first year as director she visited m any programs, met with community leader, including attending a meeting of the Community Wellness Partners founded by the Mental Health Board. Ms. Robinson's appointment of Dr. Ir ene Sung to oversee both children's and adults services will provide a stronger link for transitional age youth as they move from one system to the other . In this role, she will pr ovide medical and clinical oversight for the Children's and Adult Systems of Care. Dr. Sung will also remain as the Chief Medical Officer of Community Programs. Prior to her current posi tion, Dr. Sung was the Medi cal Director of Children, Youth and Family System of Care, Co mmunity Behavioral Health Services; Associate Medical Director, Edgewood Center for Children and Families; and Medical Director of the Family Mosaic Project, San Francisco Department of Public Health. Dr. Sung is Board certified in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. She completed medical school at the University of Mi nnesota and her residency at University of California, San Francisco. In additi on to being a member of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Dr. Sung is a past president of the Northern California Regional Organization of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. 4 Contractors for CBHS and civil service st aff have shared with the Mental Health Board that they feel that Ms. Robinson leads the departm ent very effectively. She listens to people, facilitates the developm ent of solutions to problems and acts on issues and problems. One of her first projects was to revise and update all of the policies for the department, many of which were ten years old. She has promoted strong and effective people to key positions such as Dr. Irene Sung to the position of Medical Director of both child ren's and adults services, which helps to provide more direct linkages for transitional age youth as they leave children's services. She also promoted Jim Stillwell to the position of Assistant Director of Community Behavioral Health Services. He brings nearly 30 years of experience with substance abuse, facilitating the in tegration of substance abuse and mental health. Ms. Robinson's management of the annual budget process was significantly less stressful for contracted programs than it has been in the past. The Mental Health Board looks forward to the coming year with Ms. Robinson. M. Lara Arguelles, Chair 5 COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Five Year Draft Data According to the Five Year MHSA draft, people with mental illness who participate in the Full Service Partnership s, which provide the most intensive care, do get better with such care. The preliminary data for housing show apar tment leases dramatically increased by 3000% for the Transitional Age Yout h (TAY). The TAY also showed a 71% decrease in the number of events with the criminal justice system. Also, there was a 72% reduction in hospitalization, as well as an 82% drop in homelessness for TAY. In the Adult category, the numbers were equally impressive. The report showed criminal justice involvement decreased by 32%, hospitalization was lower by 42% and homelessness dropped by 59%. In t he Older Adult group, we also saw positive results: criminal justice involvement decreased by 53%, hospitalization was lower by 55% and homelessness dropped by 33%. However, there was an 8,000% jump in re sidential treatments for Older Adults. More and more Older Adults with mental illness are participating in services and treatments. In the emergency visits induced by psychosis, TAY decreased by 86%, adults decreased by 83% and overall medica l emergencies decreased by 90%. We are making improvements in qualit y of life. For adults, we housed 236 people, and for TAY we provide housing to 43 youths. We see a reduction in arrests. Clients are getting increased ti me in a safe living environment. We achieved advanced recovery and increased em ployment opportunities. We also noticed an increase in inter-agency collaboration. The Five Year MHSA draft marks not onl y dramatic results for Full Service Partnerships but it also shows that as people improve their mental health, their physical health gets better as well. The Step-Up Step-Down model segues people in advanced recovery toward a reduced intensive case management. If there is a crisis, they w ould step up to more intensive care and then step down again to reduced intensive case management. The bad news is the decrease in Proposition 63 funds as millionaires are decreasing in the current economy. Th is shortfall means less MHSA money for the City and County of San Francisco. T hey are predicting t hat more money will increase around the year 2013. 6 There is no full-service partnership out reach in the Bayview Hunter's Point (BVHP) and the Visitacion Valley. For the 2010 Mega RFP, programs that received funding from CBHS were asked to replicate full-service programs, however, few programs were funded in Bayview and Visitacion Valley. More group therapy is being encouraged and paid peers are stepping up to co- facilitate group therapies. We encourage referrals to wellness centers to help clients maintain stability and to build themselves a healthy support system. MHSA Innovation Planning The MHSA Innovations funding presents SFDPH with an unprecedented opportunity to test new ideas with the potential to transform the local mental health service system and to supports enhanc ements in the Children, Youth, and Families and Adult and Older Adult system s of care. In 2009, the San Francisco MHSA Innovations Advisory Committee and participating community members developed an initial set of INN projects to be implem ented in FY 10/11. In addition, the INN Committee established the following five priori ties for future community-led planning. 1. Access to services for the transgender community; 2. Older adult consumers who are socially isolated and disconnected from services; 3. Residents of Bayview Hunter s Point, a high need and under-resourced geographic area of t he City where tremendous health disparities exist in mental health; 4. The need to form new partnership s particularly with the faith-based community, an underutilized sector wit h strong connections to INN- identified underserved populati ons and geographic areas; and, 5. Community-driven funding initiative s implemented within an existing institutional framework to support bringing new part ners to the table (mini grants). While the INN Advisory Committee pr ovided parameters and descriptions for each of the five priorities, the Commi ttee concluded a separate community planning process was needed to develop the overall design for each of the pilot projects. This next phase of I NN planning will bring the community together in a more focused way to turn the five priorities into creative and original mental health projects. The pr ojects will serve as incubators for new ideas and to test hypotheses that will contribute to learning how the San Francisco mental health system of services can achi eve one or more the four essential purposes defined in the st atewide INN guidelines: 1) increase access for underserved populations; 2) increase the quality of services, including achieving better outcomes; 3) promote interagency collaboration; and 4) increase access to services. 7 Mental Health Service Act (MHSA ) Update MENTAL HEALTH LOAN ASSUMPTION PROGRAM (MHLAP): MHLAP is a loan forgiveness program avail able to professionals in the mental health field who are pursuing their licenses or registrations within the state of CA. This program is a partnership with the CA Department of M ental Health (DMH) and the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Deve lopment (OSHPD CBHS has developed a local program elig ibility criteria t hat address hard-to- fill/retain professional categories as we ll as cultural and linguistic capability needed to serve our county's diverse populati ons. These criteria will be used to screen local applicants from San Francisco. MHSA Innovation Project Showcase Seeding Resilience is a new project of Gro wing Home Community Garden (GHCG) designed to increase access to ho listic wellness services and increase employment opportunities and skills. T he two year innovation project funded through MHSA is 75% focused on the GHCG (Octavia & Lily) and 25% on Urban Agricultural leaders in San Francisco to build a citywide network of support for mental health consumers. Pr ogram activities include: \u0083 Skill share opportunities fo r individuals to learn abou t: 1) cooking & nutrition; 2) garden skills; and 3) health skills and stress reduction \u0083 Regular support groups, workshops and events on topics recommended by garden members and skill share participants \u0083 Educational opportunities for urban agriculture leaders to increase their awareness, create collaborat ion opportunities and empl oyment opportunities for mental health consumers \u0083 Information about the learni ngs of the project that will be made available so that the successful parts of the projec t can be reproduced in other locations Ongoing efforts to develop partnerships wit h the urban agriculture community in San Francisco has resulted in the devel opment of SF Refresh. Inspired by Sunday Streets, SF Refresh was cr eated by Megan Rohrer, manager of the Growing Home Community Garden. T he project is being developed in partnership with the San Francisco Urban Agriculture Alliance, a new organization created to connect the city's community gardens. SF Refresh's goal is to create six daylo ng citywide events that enable San Franciscans to receive free whole body care in community garden settings in 2011. Activities include: gardening clas ses, yoga, life coaching, meditation, trauma care, nutrition classes, massage, acupuncture, movement classes, preventative health care information and more. The Seeding Resilience Project takes pl ace at the Growing Home Community Garden, which is located at 250 Octavia. 8 Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) Pr evention and Early Intervention (PEI) Update The California Departm ent of Mental Health (DMH) is charged with administering three PEI Statewide Projects: Suicide Prevention, Student Mental Health Initiative, and Stigma and Discriminat ion Reduction. San Francisco County received an annual allocation for PEI Stat ewide Projects of $750,000 for a period of four years, totaling $3,000,000. Currently, counties do not have the option to independently develop pr ograms with Prevention and Early Intervention Statewide funds. As a result, the Joint Powers Authority (JPA) known as the California Mental Health Services Au thority (CalMHSA) was founded by member counties to jointly develop, fund, and impl ement mental health services projects and educational programs at the State, regional, and local levels. CBHS, in consultation with the MHSA Advisory Committee, and with support from the Board of Supervisors, decided to assign San Francisco's allocation for PEI Statewide Programs to the California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA). San Francisco received the su pport of the CalMHSA board to join on February 10, 2011. San Francisco joins 29 other counties already participating in CalMHSA. State Releases Findings on MHSA Community Services and Supports The statewide evaluation brief of the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) provides a summary of the impact of Community Services and Supports (CSS) programs in terms of consumer outcome s. The seven key consumer outcomes include: 1) Homelessness/livin g situation; 2) Acute psych iatric hospitalization; 3) Arrest/incarceration; 4) Physical health emergency; 5) Education; 6) Mental health functioning/quality of life; 7) Employment. The outcomes are summarized below. 1. Participation in Community Serv ices and Supports (CSS) programs is strongly associated with reductions in homelessness. Overall, the number of days spent homeless de creased for transition age youth (TAY) and adults. With these reductions came additional improvements in residential outcomes. 2. CSS program participation is linked to reductions in acute psychiatric hospitalizations. The number of hospital episodes for mental health emergencies decreased across all age groups. 3. Participation in CSS programs showed a decrease in arrests and incarcerations for TAY, adults, and older adults. 9 4. There is an overall trend of reduc tions in physical health emergencies during CSS program participation across all age groups. However, since supporting evidence is lim ited, an association between CSS program participation a nd reduced physical heal th emergencies cannot be confirmed at this time. 5. There are positive trends in education in terms of school discipline events and improved academic perf ormance for children and youth participating in CSS programs. Ho wever, an association between CSS participation and improvements in educ ation cannot be asserted at this time because supporting evidence is limited. 6. Participation in CSS programs shows an overall trend toward improved mental health functioning and quality of life for adults and older adults. However, because supporting evi dence is limited, an association between CSS participation and improv ements in education cannot be confirmed at this time. 7. In regard to employment outcomes for TAY, adults, and older adults participating in CSS programs, ther e appears to be little to no change. Fiscal Year 2011-2012 MHSA Allocations: DMH has released the allocations for FY11-12. A total of $975 million will be made available to counties in this fiscal year. San Francisco's allocation amounts to $13,557,900 for Community Services and Supports (CSS); $3,638,800 for Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI); and $904,300 for Innovation (INN) for a total of $18,101,000, which is 12.49% lower than FY10-11 allocation. MHSA regulation allows counties to redirect up to 20% of the most re cent 5 year funding for capital facilities, IT, workforce development and prudent reserve. For San Francisco County, the amount allowable fo r redirection is $4,514,000. Planning for these allocations will concurrently occur with the City budgeting process and schedule. CBHS UPDATES Medical Director Update CBHS, SFGH, Community Oriented Pr imary Care, and Laguna Honda Hospital (LHH) have been working together to have th eir formularies (list of covered and available medication) as closely ma tch as possible for behavioral health medications. Such alignment means c lients placed on medications that work would not have to face the risk of needi ng to change medications at another level of care if that new level did not hav e that medication available. We have successfully matched the formularies as cl osely as possible and we believe this 10 change will greatly improve client care and ease in moving from one level of care to another. CBHS is also looking at enc ouraging the greater use of long-acting medications to make it easier for c lients who could possibly cut down on the number or frequency of medications and make it easier to comply with a treatment program that is beneficial. Network of Care CBHS contracts with the Network of Care website to facilitate access to valuable behavioral health resources and information for consumers, family members, and providers. One resource on this site is the Personal Health Record (PHR). Although over the next several years, CHBS will be developing a consumer portal to assist clients to access their DPH-based health information, the Network of Care PHR is available now. Here is an update on this valuable and free service: The PHR is free to use and contains no commercial advertisements. The PHR is a fully registered, HL7-compliant record, meeting the highest international standards for elec tronic medical records, including fully encrypted, password-protected security. The PHR offers private and safe storage of virtually any medical, health, personal and legal documents, as well as private notes. The PHR can grab and store the bes t-in-class articles from the Network of Care Library relative to any condition or medication typed into the record. It can even immedi ately find the local San Francisco service agencies that deal with that condition. Because the PHR is fully integrated with the Network of Care, it also has the remarkable capacity to find and store a wide variety of interactive self-assessment t ools and eLearning-based educational and recovery programs. The person who creates the PHR may grant access to a guest who can see all or part of the record - all under the exclusive control of the PHR's creator. A guest, in turn, can leave a private message for the record's creator inside the PHR. The person who creates a PHR can make an Emergency Card or Care Coordination Card that can be kept in a purse or wallet for valuable use in a wide variety of circumstances. The PHR has full \"interoperability standards\" with electronic medical records, if there is a willing provider. The link for San Francisco network of Care is: http://sanfrancisco.networkofcare.org/mh/home/index.cfm The Network of Care Personal Health Record is an excellent way to privately store important information that c an be easily retrieved at any time. 11 Protected Health Information (PHI) As of January 2010, sharing protected heal th information is no longer limited to providers in the DPH Safety Net; as long as the following criteria are met: 1. When sharing PHI with providers (and providers' staff) fo r the purposes of treatment, diagnosis, or referrals, or to coordinate care with any healthcare provider (any discipline and his or her staff) who has medical or psychological responsibility for the patient. 2. When coordinating care, you share the minimum amount of PHI needed to improve outcomes for the client/patient. 3. Prior to making any disclosures permitt ed, you verify the identity of the person requesting DPH PHI and the authority of any such person to have access to DPH PHI. Behavioral Health Court Update . Mental Health Courts work! These are the findings of a longitudinal, multisite study conducted by the Policy Research Associates Inc., Delmar School of Criminal Justice, University of Albany that was just published in the October 10, 2010 Archives of General Psychiatry. S an Francisco's Behavioral Health Court was one of the four participants in this st udy. The results showed fewer post-18- month arrests and incarceration days than the treatment as usual group. The mental health court graduates had lower re-arrest rates than those whose participation was terminated both during mental health court supervision and after supervision ended. San Francisco's BHC participants showed a reduction of annualized arrested by 39%, 18 months after enrolling into the program. The study conclusion states, \"Mental health courts meet the public safety objectives of lowering post-treatment arrest rates and days of incarceration. Both clinical and criminal justice factors are associat ed with better public safety outcomes for MHC participants.\" This study offers encouragement that these courts are achieving their goal of placing menta lly ill people, usually with co-occurring substance use disorders, safely in co mmunity treatment settings. Once again San Francisco has taken a lead in helping to reshape policy in the treatment and outcomes of people with mental illne ss in the criminal justice system. New Voices at Bay New Voices at Bay is written and illu strated entirely by behavioral health consumers, many of whom work at CBHS, and is published by San Francisco Study Center, a longtime CBHS contractor providing se lf-help and mental health advocacy services. The first issue featured stories about a ment al health clinic in the Tenderloin for Muslims, a former state prison inmate's plea for therapy, a piece on hoarding and cluttering and one on how Work Can Help Keep a Person Sane, among other stories. 12 San Francisco Youth Creating Community Change, (SYCCC) In response to the Department's exp anded focus on environmental prevention approaches to substance abuse, CBHS prevention providers have formed a new city-wide coalition focusing on changi ng SF laws, policies and norms that make alcohol popular, appealing, and avai lable. This coalition includes student leaders, CBHS prevention pr oviders, and advocates, including Horizons Unlimited, Community Youth Center of San Francisco, Bayview- Hunter's Point Foundation, Filipino Community Center, Samoan Community Development Center, Vietnamese Youth Development Center, National Council on Alcoholism, Japanese Community Youth Council, OMI/Excelsior Beacon, Larkin Street Youth Services, San Francisco Friday Night Live, Asian American Recovery Services, Asian Youth Prevention Services, and the Marin Institute. The Youth Leadership Inst itute staffs the c oalition. Though coalition meetings began in mid October , they have already secured a small victory with the recent SF Chronicle article target ing liquor stores that continue to sell recently banned Alcoholic Energy Drinks like Four Loko. The Coalition identified thes e continued sales as a problem, and successfully pushed for press coverage, resulting in a number of stores immediately ceasing sales. Unlike many adult-led efforts, this coalition\u2014San Francisco Youth Creating Community Change, ( SYCCC) brings youth leaders together with adult and youth to set priorities and solve problems collectively. SYCCC is currently finalizing the selection of its larger campaign and will be moving forward with campaign development and im plementation shortly. Many of the coalition's prevention provider mem bers are also launching exciting new prevention projects with t heir own youth, but focusi ng on issues of access, norms and media messages at the neighb orhood or school site level. Pathways to Discovery Pathways to Discovery, the peer-run counseling and support services component of Community Behavioral H ealth Services, hosted its annual Holiday Retreat and Celebration at 1380 Howard Street on December 22, 2010. Staff and guests were treated to a noontime celebration of food, friendship, and recognition of achievements and individu al contributions to the four year old organization, including the awarding of certificates of honor to various community institutions whose collaborations make the work of Pathways so relevant and unique. Am ong the agencies so honored were the San Francisco Study Center, Mission AC T, the Coronado Hotel, the Mental Health Board, and City College of San Francisco for helping to ably assist Pathways in attaining its goals and guiding its direction in the services to its clientele during the year just concluded. Also recognized were the contributions of the staff, the volunteers, the interns, and Pathways \"Heroes\" who contributed to another successful year. Pathways to Discovery's Director, Sandi Robison, has proposed that Mission ACT be considered for a 13 Promising Practices designat ion from the Department of Public Health, for its outstanding leadership role in advancing th e work of consumer providers in its mission and in its daily practice. We l ook forward to increased visibility from Pathways in the behavioral health community in its own mission to support and assist consumers in the ways and means of mental health/substance abuse service delivery as we enter the forthcoming year. Jelani Childcare Program Jelani, Inc. opened a new childcare area at its Family Program site. Funding was provided by Bud and Lil Moose Memori al Bright Space. The childcare area is a new addition to the Family Pr ogram that provides residential drug treatment to couples with children and fathers with thei r children. This new area will promote on-site par ental bonding and therapy se rvices for clients of Jelani, Inc. Peer Specialist Mental H ealth Certificate Program The Peer Specialist Mental Health Certificate Program - a collaboration between Richmond Area Multi-Services , Inc. and San Francisco State University's Department of Counseling presented its first cohort of graduates from the Fall Cohort of 2010. This unique class offe ring, funded by the Mental Health Services Act, allowed both agencie s to create a pioneering curriculum designed to prepare individuals for employment into the behavioral health system. After 12 weeks of intensive and rigorous training, the students are ready to increase the workforce and let their voices be heard. Engagement and retention was high with 18 students su ccessfully completing the course out of the 20 that were selected for t he initial class offering. The program included weekly classes, quizzes & exams, job shadowing and volunteer experiences that each individual had to co mplete in order to pass this course. The success of this program woul d not have been possible without the amazing support that was received from the San Fr ancisco community that came in various forms su ch as the contributions of valuable hours from our panel of guest lecturers who agreed to share their knowledge and expertise free of charge as well as donations of food and supplies. The Certificate Program had the opportunity to acknow ledge all these contributions and honor the students' accomplishments durin g the graduation ceremony held in December 2010. The presence of family members from as far as Alaska and Utah as well as having representatives from three generations truly made this event memorable. It was a fitting way to honor the level of commitment, focus, and determination of all the students who plowed through all obstacles imaginable just to finish this course. Several of the graduates came to the Open House for the Spring 2011 cohort to show support for the program but more importantly to provide assistance to the new applicants, a testament to how they have eased into their roles as 14 peer counselors. With the amount of work that has been accomplished in the past year, there is still a lot more to be done yet RAMS is filled with an overwhelming sense of renewed hope and faith in the future. Evidence Based Practices Aw ard Presentation Summary The Community Behavioral Health Servic es' Child, Youth and Family Section Provider Meeting held on December 21, 2010 was a ce lebration of providers' efforts to implement empirically based practices (EBPs) during the past year. CBHS administrators presented certificates of recognition to provider agencies for their implementation of nine types of evidence-based practices. In addition, a special CBHS/CYF Servic e Effectiveness Award was given to a team of three clinicians whose clients showed remarkable positive changes on objective outcome measures.

Southeast Child a nd Family Therapy Center External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) CBHS has successfully completed its Exte rnal Quality Review in March 2011. Due to stellar performance last year, this year's review was a Desktop review. Every year, the State of Ca lifornia Department of Ment al Health contracts with an External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) to review our initiatives, evaluate progress in our annual Qualit y Improvement Work Plan and ongoing Performance Improvement Projects, and as sess our ability to measure clinical outcomes and provide feedback to providers. EQRO had the following summary comments. CBHS was acknowledged for outstanding service delivery in that SF provides more services per client when compared to other large counties. CBHS also received high marks on our sophisticated use of data in decisi on making. They recognized the challenges of converting to a new electronic documentation system and suggested a gradual implementation of any changes in Phase II. EQRO was particularly impressed wit h the Antipsychotic Polypharmacy PIP (Performance Improvement Project) s pearheaded by Gloria Wilder, PharmD and the CBHS Pharmacy Staff. The success of this PIP was largely due to their leadership and the input and active participation of all of the Medical Directors and Prescribers. CBHS ac hieved a 21% reduction in the clients treated with multiple antipsychotics with no measured increase in utilization of crisis services or symptom severity. Electronic Health Record In January 2010, the California Department of Mental Health implemented new claiming requirements under Short- Doyle Phase II, which significantly increased the level of tr aining, claiming and repor ting requirements, and corresponding reviews. In July 2010, as part of Short Doyle Phase II, CBHS implemented a State-required new elec tronic health record (EHR), which includes billing, claims, and clinical documentation. T he new EHR, called Avatar, replaced three existing system s: 1) Insyst, a 15 year-old legacy system used for billing; 2) eCura, the managed care system used to pay private provider claims; and 3) Clinici ans Gateway, a rudimentary electronic clinical record system that was used only by civil service providers. Avatar, which is a product of Netsmart, Inc ., has been implemented as the EHR in over 20 other California counties. Implementation of the new system significantly incr eased the number users from 800 in Insyst to 2,700, primarily because it includes a full electronic health record and other new clinical functions. Since an electronic health 17 record is mandated by the State as part of Short-Doyle Phase II, it is essential that clinicians enter their clin ical documentation and other required information electronically. It is this in formation that results in the claim for reimbursement. Because a client's electronic health record is now in Avatar, other clinicians involved in a mental health client's care can access the shared client's clinical information (due to Federal privacy statutes, substance abuse treatment client information cannot be shared with clinical staff outside of the treatment program without client authorization). Allowing access to clinical information for shar ed mental health clients im proves care by ensuring care coordination and reduces the replic ation of data collection and entry by clinical staff. Additionally, it will allow CBHS to better meet one of the guiding principles of the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), which is to monitor client outcomes and increase treatment accountability by using standardized measures, all toward the goal of ensuring that our clients are improving. DPH Got Talent Fundraiser he Department of Public Health held a fundraising event featuring talented go Sai-Ling Chan-Sew retired. TDPH performing artists from staff, called \"DPH's Got Talent!\" It will showcase that talent in a family-friendly, f un-packed venue complete with celebrity judges, prizes, and bragging rights. All proceeds from this fundraiser will directly to the clients and communities we serve. The San Francisco Public Health Foundation has already signed up to assist us and manage the funds Sai -Ling Chan-Sew has been a very valuable he Child, Youth and Family Division grew exponentially under Sai-Ling's member of Community Behavioral Health Se rvices for the last thirty years. She began her career at Chinatown Ch ild Development Center. Sai -Ling reports she was in the best shape ever climbing the hills around Russian Hill to visit families in their homes and at school. She became the Director of Chinatown Child Developm ent Center in the 1980s. She expanded their programs and become an active member of the Chinatown community. In the mid 90's, Community Behavioral Health administration recognized Sai-Ling's talents and extraordinary commitment to San Francisco families and promoted her to Assistant Director and su bsequently to Director of the Child, Youth and Family Division of Community Behavioral Services.

California Mental Health Services Au thority (CalMHSA) Awards Suicide Prevention Contracts CalMHSA recently announced that it will begin contract negotiations for the fulfillment of suicide prevention services with providers who were awarded the Suicide Prevention contract. Congratulations to San Francisco Suicide Prevention , who was one of ten California agencies selected by CalMHSA. As one of the lead agencie s, San Francisco Suicide Prevention will implement a regional effort to make a broader range of additional services available to clients by exchanging expertise and tec hnologies. The other nine providers include, Didi Hirsch P sychiatric Services, Transitions Mental Health Association, North Bay Suicide Preventio n Project, Family Services Agency of Marin, Family Services Central C oast, Kings View Su icide Prevention Program, Institute on Aging Center for Elderly Suicide Prevention, AdEase, Inc., and Living Works Education, LP. Developed under the Mental Health Services Act, Suicide Prevention Statewide Prevention and Early Intervent ion, is one of three statewide projects administered by CalMH SA. Awardees will pr ovide prevention services to clients throughout California. They will also serve as the focal point for statewide suicide prevention ac tivities, including working to reduce service gaps, creating a social mark eting campaign, ex panding the number and capacity of accredited local suicid e prevention hot lin es and warm lines, and developing program curricula that will address professionals across systems and disciplines. 19 For additional information about San Fr ancisco Suicide Prevention, please contact Eve Meyer at evem@sfsuicide.org . San Francisco Health Reform Task Force Final Report Executive Summary In response to the passage of the Pa tient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (herein referred together as \"Health Re form\"), former Mayor Gavin Newsom announced the creation of a Health Reform Task Force (Task Force) to analyze the impact of Health Reform on San Francis co. The Department of Public Health (DPH) was asked to convene the Task Force. Implementation of Health Reform on both the federal and state levels will require San Francisco's health care community to be both responsive and proactive. It must respond to the various new programs, regulatory provisions and timelines. At the same time, it mu st also be proactive by anticipating implementation challenges , preparing its deliver y systems and proposing program/policy modifications, as appropria te. The formation and work of the Task Force is an example of San Francisco's proactive approach to Health Reform implementation. The mission of the Task Force was to plan for a San Francisco health care safety net that thrives under Health Reform and California's Section 1115 Medicaid waiver. The Task Force was specifically asked to develop recommendations that would be considered by the Mayor working in concert with the San Francisco Board of Supervi sors and the San Francisco Health Commission. The Task Force comprised broad repr esentation from San Francisco's health care community - providers, hos pitals, labor, advocates, business, and City staff. It met from September 2010 to March 2011 and, through a consensus process, defined the components of San Fr ancisco's health care safety net and adopted a series of local, state, and federal program and policy recommendations in five key areas: Enrollment; Infrastructure; Capacity; Economics; and Local programs. The key finding of the Task Force is that there will be a continued need for a health care safety net in San Francisco after implementation of Health Reform. San Francisco's health care safety net is composed of publ ic and private non- 20 profit organizations that disproportionatel y provide health care services to low- income, uninsured, publicly-insured, and vu lnerable populations. The safety net is still needed post-implem entation because Health Reform does not provide health care insurance for all uninsured U. S. residents. Nationwide, an estimated 23.3 million people will still be uninsured after full implement ation.1 In California, the figure is 3.1 million2 and, applying S an Francisco's current proportion of the total California population to that figure, would mean an estimated 68,400 San Franciscans would remain unins ured after Health Reform. The 37 local, state and federal reco mmendations presented in this report recognize that while Health Reform is federal law, many aspects of implementation occur at the state and local levels. As a result, communities such as San Francisco have a vested interest in not only understanding the components of the law, but also shaping the direction of its implementation locally. Following are the Task Force's recommendations. AWARDS State Department of Health Care Services award 2011 Quality Award for Medi-Cal Managed Care Program to Family Mosaic Project On May 26, 2011, Toby Douglas, Directo r of the Department of Health Care Services, presented the 2011 Quality Aw ard to Family Mosaic Project, City and County of San Francisco Department of Public Health, to acknowledge their outstanding contribution to qual ity improvement in the Medi-Cal Managed Care Program through innovati on in establishing customized performance measures and qua lity improvement projects relevant to the plan's special population of children and adolescents.

In June 2011, GABHS for Gals celebrat ed its third anniversary - we have now been advocating for women, girls, and families within San Francisco's Community Behavioral Health System for three full years! This report will detail GABHS for Gal's work over the past year. Just a reminder...What is GABHS for Gals? GABHS for Gals is a nickname for the full title of the project: Gender Appropriate and Culturally Competent Behavioral Health Services for Women, Girls, and Families. We are a special projec t of the San Francisco Mental Health Board, welcoming parti cipation from a diverse coalition of clinicians, managers, civil servants, m ental health workers, health educators, administrators, and consum ers. We are committed to advocating for gender appropriate and culturally proficient servic es for women, girls, and families in San Francisco's behavioral health system. Star ted in June 2008, GABHS for Gals has held monthly policy advocacy meetings, in viting group participation in order to work for change to support the needs of women, girls, and families. The group works for change on two parallel tracks: a macro-level track, focusing on systems and policy change, and a micro-level track, committed to supporting clinicians who provide direct service to women, girls, and families. Just a reminder...What are \"Gender A ppropriate and Culturally Competent Services?\" Gender Appropriate and Culturally Proficient Behavioral Health Services is the umbrella term used to descri be behavioral health services that both consider and meet the unique needs of women, men, girls, bo ys, transgender people, and families from all different cultures. Providers are encouraged to consider the complex interactions between biological, social, psychosocial, family, language, immigration, sexuality, geography, and cultural factors when serving each individual. These services may or ma y not include gender and/or culturally specific services, where services are targeted to only one gender or cultural group. This is in direct contrast to a gender and culturally \"neutral\" approach to service provision, where the same serv ices are provided to everyone without regard for gender and cultur e, neglecting the impact of gender and culture on client needs. All health services shoul d be both gender appropria te and culturally 23 competent. To provide the most comp rehensive, holistic treatment, providers should encourage their staff to seek tr aining on gender, culture and ethnicity, language, immigration, se xuality, geography, and their interconnections. Clinicians should feel comfortable assessing for these needs and creating treatment plans that reflect this c lient-centered approach to treatment. San Francisco's Department of Health Co mmunity Programs (and specifically Community Behavioral Health Services) s hould offer ample training opportunities in gender appropriate and culturally competent service provision. What We Have Accomplished During FY10-11: Macro Level Work Language Changes in CBHS Policies. At the request of GABHS for Gals and the San Francisco Mental Health B oard, Director Jo Robinson approved new language for the Official CBHS 2010- 2011 Mission and Vision Statement to reflect the unique role of gender in behav ioral health service provision. The statement now reads, \"The vision of behav ioral health services is to have a welcoming, culturally and linguistically competent, gender responsive , integrated, comprehensive system of care with timely access to treatment in which 'Any Door is the Right Door\" and individuals and families with behavioral health issues have medical homes\" ( 2010-2011 Organizational Provider Manual, CBHS). This is an important beginning, however this language shift has not yet been brought to the att ention of the city at large. GABHS for Gals hopes that in the upcoming year, CBHS will continue this language shift by adopting the term \"gender appropriate and culturally com petent\" in all of its policies and procedures. More work is needed on the part of CBHS leadership to ensure that this change is not just in language alone, but that practice throughout the city begins to reflect this new gender awareness. Ongoing Needs Assessment of Women a nd Girls in Behavioral Health Programs in Diverse Communities throughout San Francisco. Over the past one and a half years, GABHS for Gals and the San Francisco Mental Health Board have conducted an ongoing needs assessment of women, girls, and families in behavioral health programs in diverse communities in San Francisco. The goal of this Needs Assessments is to develop a more nuanced understanding of what it means to pr ovide gender appropriate and culturally competent behavioral health services fo r diverse communities throughout San Francisco. GABHS for Gals hoped to learn from local experts about the demographics of the women and girls in these communities, best practices and strengths of current progr ams providing behavioral hea lth services to women, girls and families, and the unmet needs of women, girls, and families being served in these communities. The Needs Assessment focused on three major neighborhoods in San Francisco: Southeast Sector (focusing on African-American populations), the Mission District (focusing on Latino/a populations), and Chinatown/North Beach (focusing on Asian and Pacific Isl ander populations). During each Needs 24 Assessment, a San Francisco Mental Health Board Intern interviewed executive directors, program managers and coordinators, therap ists, and some clients, asking the following questions: Whom does your program serve? How are you funded? What are your best practices in working with women and girls? What are the needs of the women and girls you serve? How do you address safety issues? A nd in particular, client-to-client sexual harassment policy? Each Intern kept extensive notes in an excel spreadsheet of each interview and prepared a final report and PowerPoint pr esentation summarizing her findings. Southeast Sector. In Fall 2009, Erika Carlsen, CORO Fellow for the Mental Health Board, conducted a Needs Assessment of women, girls, and family behavioral health services in the Southeast Sector (including Bayview, Hunter's Point, Visitacion Valley, Sunnyda le, and Potrero Hill), visiting twenty- four programs. Themes as to what is work ing included an ability to build trust and relationship with clients, offer services in different languages, provide culturally- competent, community-based, grassroots serv ices, provide stability, foster self- esteem, unconditional care models, and peer mentorsh ip. Themes around needs included lack of funding, services to address PTSD, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, depression, vi olence in the home and comm unity, children in foster care, healthy relationships, the divi sion of families, and stigma surrounding mental health services. Participants r equested child-care and safe space for families to interact while in services and stressed the need for culturally specific and culturally competent m ental health services t hat also address stigma surrounding mental health. Mission District. In Summer 2010, Sandra S aucedo, Mental Health Board Intern and Masters student in Psychology at CIIS, conducted a needs assessment of women girls and family beha vioral health services in the Mission District, visiting or speaking on the phone with 21 program s. The Spanish- speaking population in San Francisco is quite diverse and so this needs assessment focused on programs serving Spanish-speaking clients, regardless of country of origin of original immigrants. Ms. Saucedo identified several best practices among current programs, includi ng culturally competent programming that honors each family's immigration stor y, helping recent immigrants to adjust, not \"acculturate,\" to a new life in Sa n Francisco, latino-to-latino mentorship programs (both peer-to-peer and intergenerationally), usi ng Latino nativ e cultural traditions and practices to reduce stig ma around mental he alth issues, and embracing Latino cultures as strengths to empower healing and recovery. Needs included raising awareness about gender appropriate and/or gender-specific programming in general, lack of necessary funding to update materials and make other changes towards gender appropriate programming, stigma around mental health services, dealing with trauma on an i ndividual and community level due to immigration and family separation, j ob development, training, and higher 25 education support for youth and adults, divi sion of families and reunification of families (within this country and betw een countries), sexual exploitation, interpartner violence, integr ation of art and spiritual pr actices into healing, access to affordable/free mental h ealth programs, and lack of child care for parents who need services. Chinatown/Northbeach. In Fall 2010, Victoria Benson, CORO Fellow for the Mental Health Board, conducted a needs assessment of the Chinatown/North Beach neighborhoods, interviewing 12 agenc ies. Asian/API is a broad term encompassing people who speak several di fferent languages and who originally emigrated from several distinct countri es; the interviews in this assessment focused on Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Filipino, and Japanese populations. Best practices and strengths included incorporating API cultural and spiritual practices into behavioral health treatment, placing programs in easy access of enclaves of particular ethnic populations, client-centered programming, providing intergenerational treatment and services (as opposed to focusing on just one individual), normalizing i mmigration experiences and supporting biculturation, some gender-specific programming, addressing psychosomatic expression of behavioral health issues, and education to decrease stigma around behavioral health services. Needs include identity development for women and girls in a bicultural context, attenti on to body image/eating disorders issues, reducing family pressures to achieve in particular ways, domestic violence and sex work, addressing stigma around asking for help, trauma informed services that address traumas due to immigration and family s eparation and also traumas that occurred in home countries (suc h as war, refugee experience, etc), understanding variability wit hin one ethnic group's experiences ex. rural versus urban), and raising awareness about gende r-appropriate services in general. Final Report and Policy Recommendations. During Spring 2011, Maru Salazar, Public Policy B.A. candidate at Mills College, authored a final report summarizing the findings from the thr ee needs assessments, analyzing themes, and making policy recommendations to CBHS based on the needs assessments. The following recommendations are excerp ted from the final report (please contact Sarah Accomazzo, sarah@mhbsf.org for a copy of the final report in its entirety): \"Figure 5: Recommendations and Actions Recommendation 1: Improving quality of service delivery 1.1 Increase outreach and engagem ent strategies that are culturally relevant. 1.2 Incorporate recovery-oriented system s of care in continuum of care. Action 1.3 Develop minimum standards of practice for programs. Recommendation 2: Increasing system capacity 2.1 Dedication of gender-specific funding streams. 2.2 Increase capacity of support service programs. Action 2.3 System-wide education and training. 26 Recommendation 1: Improving quality of service delivery. To be effective, services must be of the highest quality, based on promising and best practices in the field, reflective of the cultural and developmental needs of the various age groups served, and focus ed on documented results. With this in mind, the following are actions with specific steps to improve the quality of service delivery. Action 1.1 Increase outreach and engagement strategies that are culturally relevant. In order to address the s hame and stigma that keeps women and girls of color from accessing and remaining in serv ices, outreach and engagement strategies must be deployed. These strategies will be most effective when they incorporate the cultural context of the populations of focus and are being carried out in the environments and settings where wom en and girls gather. Materials must represent the ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversit y of the three specific populations. As previously mentioned in Section 4. Evidence-Based Practices. Culturally Relevant Approach , Outreach and engagement efforts will work best when they focus on a core message. Women and girls of color living in San Francisco will benefit from learning about available services and how to access them (eligibility criteria, waiting time for intake and/or services, and what to expect when making appointment) as well as education on the signs and risks (including legal ramifications) of substance abuse and mental illness. Action 1.2 Incorporate recovery-oriented systems of care in continuum of care. Treatment services must provide suffi cient time and support for women and girls from the point of entry into services, through the treatment phase, and through the transition of reintegrating into their families and communities to better support women and girls in sustaining recovery across their lifespan. Since trauma and violence are common expe riences for women and girls in San Francisco, sufficient length of programming must be incorporated to address these issues, as they are often trigger s for substance use. In addition, a recovery-oriented lifestyle requires that individuals be connec ted to other supportive services, i.e., housing, child-care, educati onal/vocational training, pr imary health care, case management, etc. Action 1.3 Develop minimum standards of practice for programs. Based on the findings of the needs asse ssments, programs have inconsistent practices in regards to behavioral health services for women and girls of color in San Francisco. The development of minimum standards of practice across the board will increase the quality of service del ivery. Although inconsistent practices throughout the programs exist, it is important to note that many programs are implementing similar approaches and activities in their e fforts to better serve their clients. This can serve as an advantage as the requirement to meet the minimum standards can be introduced in stages, beginning with those who are closest to meeting the requirements and allowing for the programs with the greatest lack of compliance to slowly incorporate the mi nimum practices into their programming. In addition, CBHS can introduce the mini mum standards to existing grantees as 27 a condition of funding as well as incl ude these standards in future funding opportunities. Recommendation 2: Increasi ng system capacity. Increasing system capacity can onl y be done through genuine commitment and follow through to meet the needs of women and girls of color. With this in mind, the following are actions with specific steps to increase system capacity. Action 2.1 Dedication of gende r-specific funding streams. In order to guarantee the implementation of gender-responsive, trauma-informed services, dedicated gender-specific funding streams are necessary. The intentional and deliberate allocation of funds will serve as t he commitment to provide quality treatment services that provide a safe environment, have qualified staff, develops materials and contents relevant to the lives of women and girls, and allows program participants to have a proac tive role in their recovery. Due to funding cuts from local, state, and federal sources this may be difficult to achieve but perhaps by partnering with other ci ty departments such as the Department On the Status of Women and the Juveni le Justice Department, this may be easier to achieve. Action 2.2 Increase capacity of support service programs. Women and girls are experiencing other cha llenges in addition to substance use and mental illness while in treatment. T hese include the need for stable housing, educational support, vocational and employ ment training, multiple systems involvement, and parenting, to name a fe w. Often, treatment services lack coordination with other service providers, as well as there exists a limited number of programs that serve women and girls exclusively, especially those with children. In order to increase the c apacity of support serv ice programs, the incorporation of case management se rvices to existing community based behavioral health treatment services will result in more efficient use of resources. Clients will also be more likely to maintain t heir recovery over time as a result of having other issues in their lives addressed or resolved. Action 2.3 System-wide e ducation and training. Providers who participated in the needs assessment as well as the literature review, shows that women and girls are f eeling misunderstood by providers. Lack of understanding of certain cultural no rms and values, spiritual beliefs and practices as well as gender differences c ontribute to this frustration that keeps women and girls of color from acce ssing and remaining engaged in treatment services. System wide education and traini ng can be implemented with little cost to the SF DPH and CBHS by utilizing a cross education and training approach. CBHS can host the sessions in which existi ng providers can rotate in delivering educational workshops and training on practices they have been able to exceed in. For example, IFR has been successful in implementing indigenous teachings into their clinical practices and other programs can benefit greatly from this approach. Conclusion. This report examined the three needs a ssessments of African American, Latina and API women and girls in San Francisco, reviewed existing literature in respect 28 to evidence based practices and provided recommendations that will result in the improvement of service delivery. The findings identified common themes among the three populations: shame and stigma, high incidence of trauma, rela tionship issues, treatment barriers, and system issues. Included in the needs assessment is the recognition of several local programs that are employing best practices, therefore, a section is dedicated to these programs. The report also identifies five (5) key features in successful implementation of mental health and substance abuse treatment programs for women and girls. These featur es are: (1) outreach and engagement strategies, (2) gender responsive programmi ng, (3) trauma-info rmed services, (4) culturally relevant approach, and (5) re covery-oriented treatment. This report concludes with two recommendations: Improving quality of service delivery and Increasing system capacity and three action steps for each proposed recommendation.\" Safety in Community Behavioral Health Programs - Policy Brief and Program Checklist. In August 2010, GABHS for Gals par tnered with California Women's Mental Health Policy Council to publish a policy brief, entitled, \"Making Your Program More Gender Appropriate: Addre ssing Safety in Community Behavioral Health Programs.\" Building on anecdotal discussions with clinicians and program managers that identified safety as a barrier to engagement and retention of female clients in community behavioral hea lth programs, the policy brief identified a gap in current service delivery regardi ng safety and outlined current research on topics related to safety in communi ty behavioral health programs. Included with the policy brief was a Program Sa fety Checklist (developed by Sarah Accomazzo, Elizabeth Brett, and the GABHS fo r Gals work group), to be used by administrators, managers, st aff, and clinicians to raise awareness and increase safety for clients at programs. Both the policy brief and the checklist have been disseminated throughout the city and the state. Director R obinson forwarded it to the Executive Committee and CBHS staff. Perceived Safety in Programs Scale (PSPS) Research Study. A literature search of peer-reviewed journals in Spri ng 2010 demonstrated t hat there is very little written about perceived safety in community behavioral health programs; to this author's knowledge, a scale that measur es clients' sense of perceived safety and its effect on their engagem ent and retention with community agencies did not exist. Thus, Sarah spent FY10-11 working with Professor Eileen Gambrill at UC Berkeley to develop a Perceived Safety in Programs Scale, the first scale of its kind to measure perceived safety of adult clients receiving services in a behavioral health program. The ten page scale collects both quantitative data on clients' sense of perceived safety on the way to programs, in programs, and in the neighborhood where progr ams are located, and qualitative data on how clients understand safety and its impact on the behavioral health needs. In early June, UC Berkeley's IRB program gave pre liminary approval for Sarah to pilot the scale with 60 clients at San Francisco's Citywide Forensic Case Management 29 starting in July 2011. GABHS for Gals wil l use the findings from this study to contribute to the literature on effectiv e behavioral health programs and to make policy and practice recommendations to th ose serving adults in behavioral health programs. Micro Level Track Connecting Practice with Research: U pdating Practitioners on the Current Research on Behavioral Health Issu es Affecting Women, Girls, and Families: In an effort to help busy practitioners in San Francisco translate current research into practice, Heather Graham and Ann Hung, Masters in Social Work candidates at UC Berkeley's School of Social Welfare, interned with the Mental Health Board during Spring 2011. The interns produced two major products intended to make research more a ccessible to practitioners. First, each woman picked a topic related to behavioral health practice for women, girls, and families, conducted a literature review in peer-reviewed journals and academic books, and prepared a PowerPoint presentat ion summarizing the research they reviewed and its implications for prac titioners in San Francisco. Ms. Graham focused on Girls and Aggression, and Ms. Hung focused on Early Puberty. On June 8th, 2011, they presented their findings and conducted a discussion during a Brown Bag Lunch, entitled, \"A Focus on Girls: Aggression and Early Puberty.\" Both presentations made a strong case that overall, the lack of rigorous research on these topics is a serious barrier to pr oviding the most effective services for women and girls. Second, Ms. Hung and Ms. Graham co mpiled several annotated lists of resources for practitioners who work with women, girls, and families. This project was specifically in response to anecdotal stories from practitioners who attended the Brown Bag Lunch trainings and ev aluations and the Gender Responsive Trainings put on by CBHS; these practi tioners commented that they do not know where to go to find listings of resource s for women and girls throughout San Francisco, and they requested a cent ralized, \"one stop shop\" for these resources. In order to begin creating content to meet these needs, Ms. Hung and Ms. Graham compiled a Government Repor t List (any repor ts by government entities on women and girls' behavioral hea lth issues in the past ten years), Journal Article List (journal articles with summaries about women and girls' behavioral health issues), and a Big List of Resources List (a centralized list of other lists of resources for women and girls in the San Francisco Bay Area). Currently, these lists are posted on the GABHS for Gals webpage for public access, and they were emailed to Brown Bag Lunch attendees. Staff will continue adding to these lists over the next year. Eventually, these lists will form the basis of content for the new an updated GABHS for Gals website. (For a copy of these presentations or lis ts, please email Sarah Accomazzo at sarah@mhbsf.org .) 30 Women and Girls Hot Topics Seminar Series . In March 2010, GABHS for Gals kicked off a \"Women and Girls Hot Topics Seminar Series.\" This series was a direct response to feedback received in the First Annual GABHS Survey and also from participants in CBHS' 2009 Women's Health Conference, asking for more trainings on topics related to women and gi rls, with a diverse set of trainers who deliver specifics about how to work with diverse clients in San Francisco. These brown bag lunch workshops focus on best practices for working with women and girls in San Francisco, always with an eye to cultural contexts, and features \"local experts,\" or trainers who work in San Francisco and provide case examples from a diverse clientele base in San Francisco. During Summer 2010, nearly 315 participants from over 50 agencie s took part in a three part series on body image and/or a three part series on trauma. Feedback on evaluations was overwhelmingly positive and participants ca lled for more workshops on similar subjects. The schedule for Summer 2011 includes: Date: June 8 th, 2011 Title: A Focus on Girls: Aggression and Early Puberty Speaker: Ann Hung & Heather Graham Attendees: 23 Date: July 8th, 2011 Title: Final Report: Assessment of Behaviora l Health Needs of Women and Girls of Color in San Francisco Speaker: Maru Salazar Date: July 2011 Title: Safety in Community Mental Health Programs Speaker : Sarah Accomazzo, MSW Date: August 2011 Title: Media Literacy and Body Image Speaker : About-Face, Inc. Date: September 2011 Title: TBD Full Day of Body Image Training. In response to requests for further body image training and longer am ounts of time devoted to body image content with more room for discussion and in-depth anal ysis of case examples, GABHS for Gals held a day-long training on August 9th, 2010, entitled \"Debunking the Myths: Working with Women and Girls from Diverse Cultural Backgrounds around Body Image and Eati ng Disorders.\" Marcella Raimondo, MPH, led the training and the San Francisco Public Health Institute offered CEUs for 30 providers. The training was at the San Francisco Public Library and 100 people attended from more than 60 agencies throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. 31 MENTAL HEALTH BOARD PRIORITI ES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2010-11 \u0083 ADD FROM RETREAT POWERPOINT AND GOING FORWARD Mental Health Board Projects Police Crisis Intervention Training The last Mental Health Board facilitated Po lice Crisis Intervention Training was in June 2010. The police department chose to take the training in house for the next fiscal year but it was not until Januar y 2011, after a police incident with a mentally ill person in front of the CBHS building, that the Police Commission, under the leadership of Commissioner Angela Chan, that a task force of police officers and community stakehol ders met to plan a new vers ion of the training. It was decided that San Francisco would implement the full Memphis Model in addition to the training. A designated t eam of officers would be formed to respond to calls involving a person with ment al illness. That planning is still in process and no trainings have been conducted yet. Southeast Sector of San Francisco The board has continued to staff meetings in Visita cion Valley and provide a bridge of information to the community. A few collaborations were developed between programs in the Bayview and Visitaci on Valley, but very little significant additions to funding from CBHS. Most cli ents in the Southeast Sector must still travel to other parts of the city for serv ices that are potentially less culturally sensitive to their needs. Staff Projects The administrator serves on the Department of Public Health (DPH) Community Programs Disaster Planning Team in S an Francisco and the Bay Area. The team started in meeting in April 2010. The administrator is a certified EMT and volunteered at CBHS's HIN1 vaccination program and has also volunteered at m any city involved street fairs. The special projects manager worked wit h the Children, Youth and Families System of Care analyzing critical data on outcomes from treatment. 32 THE MENTAL HEALTH BOARD \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.\" \u2014Margaret Mead Each of California's 58 counties operates a public mental health system. Under state law each of these systems must have the input of citizen advisors in the form of an official Mental Health Board. Each county may tailor its Board to meet local needs. In San Francisco, our Board has 17 members. Each of our 11 Supervisors makes an individual appointment and the remainin g 6 seats are appointed by the full Board, through the Rules Committee. The categories of membership are as follows: 5 Consumer Seats 6 Family Member Seats 3 Public Interest Seats 2 Mental Health Professional Seats 1 Member of the Board of Supervisors The Board provides advice on progr am development, budget prioritization, policy, and strategic planning. The 4 ke y duties of the Board members are: 1. Attend the monthly Ment al Health Board meeting. This is where resolutions are discu ssed, debated, and decided. Many of the issues are complicated ones, requiri ng a great deal of background reading and discussion in preparation for a vote. 2. Serve on an MHB Committee. Each member serves on one MHB Committ ee, attends its monthly meeting, and participates fully in its work. Committees develop recommendations to send to the full Board. They also pl an and carry out special site visits, projects, and events. 3. Conduct Program Reviews Each member of the MHB must do at least one program review per year. We go out to a mental health program and interview the clients about what's working in the program and what needs to be improved. 4. Attend the Annual Retreat Once a year, the Board meets all day on a Saturday, which counts as the Board meeting for that month.
