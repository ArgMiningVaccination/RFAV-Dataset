The title, playing on the absurd myth that vaccination causes autism (with the underlying assumption that it's a disease that could or should be cured), points out that many of the scientific and cultural advances we take for granted and rely on are the direct result of the hard work, outside-the-box thinking, and singular focus of neurodiverse minds.
