The meditation practices associated with modern Theravda Buddhism derive from a lineage that dates to the time of the Buddha himself, yet the development and transmission of these practices across centuries is varied and not widely understood.

With authoritative explication of a range of Buddhist texts preserved primarily in the Pali language\u2014canonical discourses, commentarial treatises, and rare meditation manuals\u2014Cousins explores a multiplicity of meditation practices that have developed over the past two and a half millennia, from the jhna (absorption) and vipassan (insight) methods that constitute the core of modern Theravda practice to lesser-known, esoteric practice lineages of Central and Southeast Asia that were nearly lost to history.RelatedCheck items to add to the cart or Author BioL. S. Cousins (1942-2015) was one of the world's foremost experts on Pali Buddhism. He taught at the University of Manchester and the University of Oxford and was a founding member of the Samatha Trust, an organization that fosters practice and study in the samatha-vipassan meditation tradition.Sarah Shaw is a faculty member and lecturer at the University of Oxford. She has published numerous works on the history and practices of Buddhism, including Mindfulness and The Art of Listening.Praise - Shaw](https://www.shambhala.com/authors/o-t/sarah-shaw.html)$18.95Paperback \"An unprecedented exploration of meditation experience as described in the Pali canon, commentaries, and abhidhamma\u2014as well as lesser-known sources\u2014this study reflects Cousins's nuanced sensitivity as a lifelong practitioner and his wealth of textual expertise.\" \u2014Kate Crosby, author of Esoteric Theravada \"This is a carefully and comprehensively written work. Cousins's treatment and defense of traditional calm (jhna) meditation catches my eye most, as insight (vipassan) meditations are so much more popular now around the world. This book, by showing the whole historical picture, makes an important addition to the scholarship on meditation.\" \u2014Sayadaw Dr. Khammai Dhammasami, president of the International Association of Buddhist Universities \"Meditations of the Pali Tradition shines an incisive light on the multifaceted jewel of the meditation practices of Southern Buddhism across the ages, drawing in sidelights from related material in other early Buddhist schools and their transmissions to China. Cousins writes with deep knowledge of and informed interest in a network of meditative practices as interpreted and developed from the Pali Canon, abhidhamma, and commentaries. He explores the nature and role of the jhnas and formless attainments, their effects on feeling and perception, and how these practices concerning calm (samatha) relate to those of insight (vipassan). He addresses not only the roots and developments of modern vipassan meditation, but also the more esoteric visualization practices of the Porna meditative traditions that were sidelined by modern vipassan but are now being increasingly uncovered and explored. In an impartial and discerning way, he leads us through some of the rich intricacies of these different systems and their emphases. This illuminating work, which broadens and deepens our picture of meditation in the Southern, 'Theravda' tradition, will be of great interest both to scholars and to practitioners of these and other meditations.\" \u2014Peter Harvey, cofounder of the UK Association for Buddhist Studies and author of An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History, and Practices (Cambridge University Press) \"Thanks to the tireless efforts of editor Sarah Shaw, a whole new generation of readers can delve deep into the late Lance Cousins's meticulous research on the history of meditation in Southern Buddhism. In this brilliant new book that Shaw has carefully edited after Cousins's passing in 2015, readers learn about the history of jhna, samatha, and vipassan meditation methods in both Pali literature and in modern practice. This will be a fundamental book for any student of Buddhist history and literature, as well as for practitioners in need of a detailed and comprehensive overview. It is truly a great gift from a scholar we lost too soon.\" \u2014Justin Thomas McDaniel, professor of Buddhist studies, University of Pennsylvania \"Cousins's wide interests inspired him to delve deeply into the core questions of Buddhism, mysticism, and religious studies. His writings are the fruit of a keen and sensitive wisdom tempered by personal experience and an unparalleled knowledge of the original texts in the original languages. They offer fresh and timely insights into Buddhist thought, practice, and history.\" \u2014Peter Skilling, author of Questioning the Buddha: A Selection of Twenty-Five Sutras \"Meditations of the Pali Tradition is both calming and insightful. As a forest monk, it can be painful to read the overly convoluted and contentious diatribes which are found too often in academic discourse. Cousins's book is a welcome relief from such thickets. In addition to his skill in arranging, elucidating, and reconciling disparate texts in multiple languages and from various traditions, two other qualities shine through in this work: his respect for 'forest specialists' and his interest in the practical application of his erudition. This book provides fresh perspectives into both much-loved discourses and arcane treatises, all the while presenting them with concern, humility, and the estimable sincerity of someone who was trying to translate the Dharma into their own heart's vernacular.\" \u2014Ajahn Kovilo, senior incumbent, Clear Mountain MonasterySelected Reader Reviews - "}
