Our FY 2023 budget request includes $13.3 billion to support HRSA's vital work to advance health equity; expand access to health care services in the communities that need it most; reduce maternal and infant mortality; and grow, diversify and promote the well -being of the healt h workforce. With ongoing appropriations and resources from the American Rescue Plan, HRSA -supported programs have played a critical role in combatting the COVID -19 pandemic in the hardest hit communities across the country over the past year. With HRSA's support, Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics have built new capacity to respond to COVID -19 and distributed vaccines, boosters, tests, masks and therapeutics to help prevent, mitigate and treat COVID in underserved communities. At t he same time, HRSA has awarded grants to more than 150 national and local organizations to support on-the -ground outreach by trusted messengers to help people make informed decisions about vaccination for themselves and their families. In addition to delivering essential COVID supplies and resources, HRSA has made critical investments to support and expand the health workforce over the past year, including growing our scholarship and loan repayment programs for health care providers who commit to practicing in underserved communities to the largest numbers in the program's history; launching a new initiative to address the well -being and mental health of the health care workforce; announcing a new program to train more than 13,000 community health workers to better connect individuals to care; and investing in growing the mental health and substance use disorder workforce. Over the last year, we also made billions in relief payments to health care providers to help sustain health care access in their communities and retain and support their workforce as they respond to COVID-19, as well as regularly reimbursing providers for COVID -19 testing, treatment, and vaccine administration for people who are uninsured. As we've work ed to mitigate COVID -19, we have continued to make essential health care available for millions of individuals most in need, including through primary care services for approximately 30 million people through HRSA -supported community health centers; HIV/AIDS services to more than a half a million people through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program; HRSA -funded infant screenings, preventive care and other child services for an estimated 60 million pregnant people and children; substance use disorder services for more than 1,500 rural counties; discounts of up to 50 percent on the cost of prescription drugs for the patients of more than 13,000 safety-net providers; organ transplants for approximately 39,000 people - the highest annual number on record; and more than a million interventions by Poison Control Centers. Our FY 2023 Budget Request continues and expands on this critical work. Page 2 The HRSA FY 2023 Budget R equest: Prioritizes reducing maternal mortality and addressing the disproportionate burden of poor maternal outcomes on Black women by investing in the social determinants of maternal health, increasing screening and treatment for maternal depression, and increasing and diversifying the midwife and doula workforces; Makes strategic investments in growing the mental health and substance use disorder workforce to expand access to behavioral health care and advance integration of these services with primary care to improve health outcomes; Expands critical child health programs to support health equity, including extending and expanding the evidence -based, voluntary Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program and funding a new effort to provide early childhood screening and development services in health center s; Increases and diversi fies the health care workforce to meet growing needs while promoting well -being and prevent ing burnout for those on the frontlines; Reaffirms our commitment to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by investing in increasing access to treatment, expanding PrEP ( pre-exposure prophylaxis) to prevent infection, and ensuring equitable access to services and supports; and, Strengthens rural health care access by increasing fund ing for rural health care providers and rural residency programs. HRSA's FY 2023 Budget Request builds on the lessons learned from the pandemic to focus on the critical needs of underserved and rural communities, including the importance of equitable access to high quality primary care and mental and substance use disorder services and the need for a robust and well -support ed health workforce. I look forward to working with Congress on its enactment. /Car ole Johnson/ Carole Johnson Administrator Health Resources and Services Administration Office of Federal Assistance ManagementOffice of

alth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is an Agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Department's mission is, in part, to enhance the health and well -being of Americans by providing effective health and human services. In alignment with this mission, HRSA is the principal Federal agency charged wi th increasing access to effective and efficient basic health care for those individuals and families who are medically underserved due to barriers (e.g., economic, geographic, linguistic, cultural) they face in obtaining appropr iate and quality care. HRSA supports programs and services that improve health equity, for example: Underserved persons who live in rural and poor urban neighborhoods where health care providers and services are scarce; Individuals who lack health insurance \u2014many of whom are racial and ethnic minorities; African American infants who have 2.3 times the infant mortality rate as non-Hispanic white infants, 1 and African -American mothers who have 3.2 times the pregnancy-related mortality rate as non -Hispanic white mothers2; The 1.2 mill ion people living with HIV infection3; Persons affected by opioid use disorders and other substance use disorders; and The 106,444 individuals who are waiting for an organ transplant.4 By focusing on these and other underserved and at -risk groups, HRSA's leadership and programs promote the improvements in healthcare access and quality that are essential to improve health equity and enable a healthy nation. 1 Ely DM, Driscoll AK.

The Highlights section below groups key program performance measures by HRSA's goals and includes anticipated measure targets for fiscal year (FY) 2023. In collaboration with states, communities, and organizations, the performance examples below illustrate how HRSA will continue to improve health outcomes and address disparities through access to quality services, a skilled health workforce, and innovative, high-value programs for millions of Americans who are geographically isolated and economically or medically underserved. Highlights HRSA Goal: Take actionable steps to achieve health equity and improve public health. HRSA programs leverage community partnerships and stakeholder collaborations to promote overall health and disease prevention across the populations served through HRSA programs and support diversity, equity, and inclusion for HRSA funding recipients. In FY 2023, 516,000 unique individuals will receive direct services through Feder al Office of Rural Health Policy Outreach grants, which improve rural health through community coalitions and evidence -based models by focusing on quality improvement, health care access, coordination of care, and integration of services. In FY 2023, HRSA expects to have nearly 150,000 cord blood units from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations available through the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program , increasing the likelihood of finding suitably matched donors among these populations wit h a high rate of diversity in tissue types. The Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant program anticipates the ratio of the Black infant mortality rate to the White infant mortality rate will decrease to 2 to 1 in FY 2023. HRSA Goal: Improve access t o quality health services. HRSA programs support the direct delivery of health services and health system improvements that increase access to health care and help reduce health disparities. In FY 2023, the Health Centers Program expects to sustain health centers' provision of affordable, accessible, quality, and cost efficient care to 30.0 million patients. HRSA expects to help states serve 63 percent of children through the MCH Block Grant program in FY 2023, providing funding to address states' highest M CH priorities. The MCH Block Grant program expects to contribute to the reduction of the national infant mortality rate to 5.3 per 1,000 in FY 2023 by funding state MCH activities to improve the health of mothers, children, and families, particularly among low-income mothers and families or those with limited availability of care. 17 In FY 2023, HRSA expects to serve 76,000 new clients under the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiat ive. By ensuring the provision of HIV medications and related services to more than 285 ,000 persons in FY 2023 through the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, HRSA will continue its contribution to reducing AIDS -related mortality for low -income and uninsured people living with HIV/AIDS. In FY 2023, 84 % of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program clients re ceiving HIV medical care and at least one viral load test are expected to be virally suppressed. To increase the number of patients from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds able to find a suitably matched unrelated adult donor for their blood stem cell transplants, the Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Program projects that it will have nearly 4.02 million adults on the donor registry in FY 2023 from underrepresented racial or ethnic populations. The Organ Transplantation program projects that it will facilitate the transplantation of more than 33,300 deceased donor organs in FY 2023. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program projects that it will serve 163,000 participants in FY 2023. HRSA works to improve the health care system by bolstering the healthcare workforce through provider placement, retention, and training activities. In FY 2023, 11,000 healthcare providers will be deemed eligible for Federal Tort Claims Act malpractice coverage through the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice program. The program encourages providers to volunteer their time at sponsoring free clinics, thereby expanding the capacity of the healthcare safety net. HRSA Goal: Foster a health workforce and health infrastructure able to address current and emerging needs. HRSA will seek to advance the resiliency of the health workforce and improve the supply, geographic distribution, and diversity of the health workforce. HRSA's Bureau of Health Workforce plans to increase the percentage of completers of its supported health profession training programs who are underrepresented minorities and/or from disadvantaged background to 47 percent in FY 2023. Additionally BHW plans for 40 percent of individuals supported by its programs who complete primary care trainin g programs to be employed in underserved areas. Performance Management Performance management is central to the agency's overall management approach and performance -related information routinely is used to improve HRSA's operations and those of its grantee s. 18 As the key element of the performance management process, HRSA Senior Staff establish annual fiscal year performance plans, including metrics and indicators of success, directly linked to implementation of the HRSA Strategic Plan and additional prioriti es, as appropriate. Regular performance reviews take place several times a year between Senior Staff and the Administrator/Deputy Administrator, including during regularly scheduled one -on-one meetings, mid-year and year -end Senior Staff performance revi ews, and ad hoc meetings to address emerging issues.

FY 2023 Community Health Cente r Fund Authorization ................................................ $4 billion Allocation Method .................................................... Competitive grants/cooperative agreements Program Description and Accomplishments For more than 50 years, health centers have delivered affordable, accessible, quality, and cost - effective primary health care t o patients regardless of their ability to pay. During that time, health centers have become an essential primary care provider for millions of people across the country. Health centers advance a model of coordinated, comprehensive, and patient -centered pri mary health care, integrating a wide range of medical, dental, behavioral health, and patient support/enabling services. Today, approximately 1,400 health centers operate over 14,000 service delivery sites that provide care in every U.S. State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Basin. In 2020, health centers served 28.6 million patients, a reduction of approximately 1.2 million patients, or 4 percent, due to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the operations of health 22 FY 2022 and FY 2023 levels reflect the post -sequestration funding amount. 64 centers nationwide. Even through these challenges, health centers served one in every eleven people living in the United States, providing approximately 114 million patient visits (a 7% decrease), at an average cost of $1,157 per patient (including Federal and non-Federal sources of funding). In 2020, about 42 percent of all health centers served rural areas providing care to nearly 9 million patients, about one in 5 people living in rural areas. Patient services are supported through Federal Hea lth Center grants, Medicaid, Medicare, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), other third party payments, self -pay collections, other Federal grants, and State/local/other resources. Health centers have performed a critical role in the U.S. response t o the COVID -19 pandemic, while continuing to provide high quality primary health care services for the nation's underserved and vulnerable populations. Health centers successfully expanded telehealth and introduced new critical service lines, including CO VID-19 testing, treatment and vaccinations. In 2020, health centers reported a nearly 6,000 percent growth in virtual visits from the previous year, from 478,000 to 28.5 million, with more than 99 percent of health centers offering virtual primary health care services. Not all primary care services were impacted equally by COVID -19. While health centers reported an increase of 1.8 million mental health patient visits which was 15 percent over 2019 levels, decreases were reported in medical visits (3.8 p ercent), enabling services (9.6 percent), vision care (27.9 percent), and oral health (34.4 percent). Through the American Rescue Plan Act, HRSA is providing one -time funding to support health centers in responding to and mitigating the spread of COVID -19, and enhancing health care services and infrastructure. Improvements made with these funds will help health centers to continue meeting the needs of their patient population through the pandemic by providing equitable access to COVID -19 vaccination, test ing, and treatment, and supporting critical preventive and primary health care services, as well as health center construction, renovation, modernization a nd other facility improvements. To ensure our nation's underserved communities and those disproportionately affected by COVID-19 are equitably vaccinated against COVID -19, HRSA in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed the Health Center COVID -19 Vaccine Program to directly allocate COVID -19 vaccines to HRSA -support ed health centers. Through this program, millions of people living in the nation's medically underserved communities and those disproportionately affected by COVID -19 have received vaccines. In addition, HRSA provided at -home self -tests, point of care testing equipment and supplies, and NIOSH-approved N95 respirator masks for health center patients and individuals in their communities. HRSA, in partnership with HHS partners, also launched a program to directly allocate oral antiviral pills for the outpatient treatment of mild to moderate COVID -19 in health centers. Health centers continue to deliver high quality and value -based care by using key quality improvement practices, including health information technology. 77 percent of health centers are curre ntly recognized by national accrediting organizations as Patient Centered Medical Homes - an advanced model of patient -centered primary care that emphasizes quality and care 65 coordination through a team based approach to care. Despite treating a sicker, poorer, and more diverse population than other health care providers, health centers exceeded numerous national averages and benchmarks in 2020 including the Healthy People 2020 goal for dental sealant services. Overall, 90 percent of health centers met or exceeded Healthy People 2020 goals for at least one clinical measure in 2020 23. Health centers also reduce costs to health systems; the health center model of care has been shown to reduce the use of costlier providers of care, such as emergency departments and hospitals 24. Populations served: Health centers serve a diverse patient population. In 2020: People of all ages: Approximately 28 percent of patients were children (age 17 and younger), a 14.5 percent decrease from 2019; over 10 percent were 65 or older, an increase of 2.3 percent. Adult patients (18-64) remained relatively steady. People in poverty: Approximately 91 percent of health center patients are individuals or families living at or be low 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines as compared to approximately 26 percent of the U.S. population as a whole. People without and with health insurance: About 22 percent were without health insurance. Those patients that are insured are cov ered by Medicaid, Medicare, other public insurance, or private insurance. Special Populations: Some health centers receive specific funding to provide primary care services for certain special populations including individuals and families experienci ng homelessness, agricultural workers, those living in public housing, and Native Hawaiians. Health centers served nearly 1.3 million individuals experiencing homelessness, almost 1 million agricultural workers and their families, approximately 5.2 million people living in or near public housing and over 7,000 Native Hawaiians. o Health Care for the Homeless Program: Homelessness continues to affect rural as well as urban and suburban communities in the United States. According to the Department of Housing a nd Urban Development's 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress, over 1.4 million people experienced sheltered homelessness. In 2020, HRSA -funded health centers provided primary care services for nearly 1.3 million persons in supportive housing and/or experiencing homelessness. The Health Care for the Homeless Program supports coordinated, comprehensive, integrated primary care including substance use disorder and mental health services for homeless persons in the United States, serving patients that live on the street, in shelters, or in transitional housing. o Migrant Health Center Program: HRSA -funded health centers provided primary care services for nearly 1 million migratory and seasonal agricultural workers and their families. It is estimat ed that there are approximately 2.8 million migratory and seasonal agricultural workers in the United States (2016 LSC Agricultural 23 HP2020 objectives: https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics -objectives 24 Nocon, Robert S. et al. \"Health Care Use and Spending for Medicaid Enrollees in F ederally Qualified Health Centers Versus Other Primary Care Settings\" American Journal of Public Health, Nov 2016 66 Worker Population Estimate Update). The Migrant Health Center Program supports comprehensive, integrated primary care servic es for agricultural workers and their families with a particular focus on occupational health and safety. o Public Housing Primary Care Program: The Public Housing Primary Care Program increases access for residents of public housing to comprehensive, integrated primary care services. Health centers deliver care at locations on the premises of public housing developments or immediately accessible to residents. HRSA -funded health centers provided primary care services for nearly 5.2 million people living in or near public housing. The Public Housing Primary Care Program provides services that are responsive to identified needs of the residents and in coordination with public housing authorities. o Native Hawaiian Health Care Program: The Native Hawaiian Health Care Program, funded within the Health Center appropriation, improves the health of Native Hawaiians by making health education, health promotion, and disease prevention services available through a combination of outreach, referral, and linkage mech anisms. Services provided include nutrition programs, screening and control of hypertension and diabetes, immunizations, and basic primary care services. Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems provided medical and enabling services to over 7,000 people. Allocation Method: Public and non-profit private entities, including tribal, faith-based and community-based organizations are eligible to apply for funding under the Health Center Program. New health center grants are awarded based on a competitive process that includes an assessment of need and merit. In addition, health centers are required to compete for continued grant funding to serve their existing service areas at the completion of every project period (generally every 3 years). New Health Center Pro gram grant opportunities are announced nationally and applications are reviewed and rated by objective review committees (ORC), composed of experts who are qualified by training and experience in particular fields related to the Program. Funding decisions are made based on ORC assessments, announced funding preferences and program priorities. In making funding decisions, HRSA applies statutory awarding factors including funding priority for applications serving a sparsely-populated area; consideration of the rural and urban distribution of awards (no more than 60 percent and no fewer than 40 percent of projected patients come from either rural or urban areas); and continued proportionate distribution of funds to the special populations served under the Health Center Program. Patient Care: The number of health center patients served in 2020 was 28.6 million; an increase of 9.1 million, or 47 percent, above the 19.5 million patients served in 2010. Of the 28.6 million patients served and for those for whom i ncome status is known, approximately 91 percent were at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level and approximately 22 percent were uninsured. Success in increasing the number of patients served has been due in large part to the development of new health centers, new satellite sites, and expanded capacity at existing clinics. 67 Health centers focus on integrating care for their patients across the full range of services - not just medical but oral health, vision, behavioral health (mental health and substance use disorder services), and pharmacy. Health centers also deliver crucial services such as case management, transportation, and health education, which enable target populations to access care. Nearly 93 percent of health centers provide preventive dental services either directly or via contract. In 2020, health centers provided oral health services to approximately 5.2 million patients, an increase of almost 40 percent since 2010. In 2020, over 2.8 million people received behavioral health se rvices at health centers, an increase of over 100 percent from 2014 to 2020 due to significant Health Center Program investments in behavioral health services. From FY 2016 through FY 2019, HRSA invested $540 million in targeted, ongoing annual grant fundi ng for the expansion of substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health (MH) services in health centers. An additional $300 million has been invested in one -time health center infrastructure costs that support the expansion of services. These ongoing annual investments remained in health center continuation awards in FY 2021 and are projected to continue in future fiscal years. This funding supports health centers in implementing and advancing evidence -based strategies to expand access to quality integrate d SUD prevention and treatment services, including those addressing opioid use disorder (OUD) and other emerging SUD issues, to best meet the health needs of the population served by each health center; and/or to expand access to quality integrated mental health services, with a focus on conditions that increase risk for, or co- occur with SUD, including OUD. Screening for substance use disorders has increased 93 percent since 2016 with the number of patients receiving screening, brief intervention, referra l and treatment (SBIRT) increasing from 716,677 in 2016 to 1,253,127 in 2020. From 2016- 2020, the number of health center providers eligible to prescribe MAT increased over 390 percent (from 1,699 in 2016 to 8,362 in 2020) and the number of patients recei ving MAT increased 366 percent (from 39,075 in 2016 to 181,896 in 2020). Improving Quality of Care and Health Outcomes: Health centers continue to provide quality primary and related health care services, improving the health of the Nation's underserved communities and populations. HRSA -funded health centers are evaluated on a set of performance measures emphasizing health outcomes and the value of care delivered. These measures provide a balanced, comprehensive look at a health center's services toward co mmon conditions affecting underserved communities. Performance measures align with national standards and are commonly used by Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance/managed care organizations. Benchmarking health center outcomes to national rates demons trates how health center performance compares to the performance of the nation overall. Timely entry into prenatal care is an indicator of both access to and quality of care. Identifying maternal disease and risks for complications of pregnancy or birth during the first trimester can also help improve birth outcomes. Results over the past few years demonstrate improved performance as the percentage of pregnant health center patients that began prenatal care in the first trimester grew from 57.8 percent in 2011 to 73.0 percent in 2020, meeting the program target. Additional maternal health efforts will continue to advance performance on this goal and improve health outcomes. Appropriate prenatal care management can also have a significant effect on the incid ence of low birth weight (LBW), the risk factor most closely associated with neonatal mortality. Monitoring 68 birth weight rates is one way to measure quality of care and health outcomes for health center female patients of childbearing age, approximately 25 percent of the total health center patient population served in 2020. In 2020, the health center rate was 8.18 percent, lower than the 2020 national rate of 8.24 percent, and has consistently been lower than the national rate during the past sev eral years. Health center patients, including low -income individuals, racial/ethnic minority groups, and persons who are uninsured, are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Clinical evidence indicates that access to approp riate care can improve the health status of patients with chronic diseases and thus reduce or eliminate health disparities. The Health Center Program began reporting data from all grantees on the control of hypertension and diabetes via its Uniform Data S ystem in 2008. In 2020, 58 percent of adult health center patients with diagnosed hypertension had blood pressure under adequate control (less than 140/90), and 64 percent of adult health center patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes had their most recent hemo globin A1c (HbA1c) under control (less than or equal to 9 percent). Health centers improve health outcomes by emphasizing the care management of patients with multiple health care needs and the use of key quality improvement practices, including health information technology. HRSA's Health Center Program Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Initiative supports health centers to achieve national PCMH recognition, an advanced model of primary care using a team -based approach to improve quality through coordination of care and patient engagement. In FY 2021, more than three -fourths of HRSA -funded health centers were recognized as PCMHs. In addition, health centers have advanced quality and accountability by adopting Health Information Technology (HIT) , includi ng the use of certified Electronic Health Records (EHRs), telehealth and other technologies that advance and enable quality improvement. Over 99 percent of all health centers reported having an EHR and utilizing telehealth services in 2020. Promoting Efficiency: Health centers provide cost -effective, affordable, quality primary health care services. The Program's efficiency measure tracks the ratio of medical patients per medical physicians in health centers, which focuses on maximizing the overall efficie ncy and scope of clinical provider teams, recognizing the valuable and cost effective contributions of physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives to health center patient access to comprehensive, quality primary care services. In 2018 and 2019, the number of medical patients per physician in health centers was approximately 1,780. In 2020, the number decreased to 1,713, likely due to the impacts of COVID -19 on the total patient number in health centers. External Evaluation: In addition to internal monitoring of health center performance, peer reviewed literature and major reports continue to document that health centers successfully increase access to care, promote quality and cost -effective care, and improve patient outcomes, especially for traditi onally underserved populations. Health centers that receive supplemental substance use disorder -specific HRSA grants had increased substance abuse disorder service capacity and utilization.

Health centers serve as an essenti al pathway to accessing mental health and maternal health care. Among female patients of reproductive age, 40.8% of patients reported depression; 28.8% reported generalized anxiety; and 15.2% met the criteria for serious psychological distress. Furthermore , patients with depression had two to three times higher odds of experiencing co-occurring physical health conditions. Lin SC, Tyus N, Maloney M, Ohri B, Sripipatana A.

Enabling services were associated with more health center visits, higher probability of getting a routine checkup, a higher likelihood of having had a flu shot, and a higher probability of patient satisfaction. Systematic delivery of enabling services in health centers improve access to care and patient sat isfaction. Yue D, Pourat N, Chen X, Lu C, Zhou W, Daniel M, Hoang H, Sripipatana A, Ponce NA.

PMID: 31479374. Health centers with longer periods of PCMH recognition were more likely to have improved their clinical quality on 9 of 11 measures, than health centers with fewer years of PCMH recognition. (Ruwei Hu, Lee; \"The Association of Patient - Centered Medical Home Designation with Quality of Care of HRSA -Funded Health Centers: A Longitudinal Analysis of 2012 - 2015\" Medical Care, 2018 Feb; 56(2): 130- 138). Health center Medicaid patients had lower use and spending than did non-health center patients across all services, with 22 percent fewer visits and 33 percent lower spending on specialty care, and 25 percent fewer admissions an d 27 percent lower spending on inpatient care. Total spending was 24 percent lower for health center patients. (Nocon, Robert S. et al. \"Health Care Use and Spending for Medicaid Enrollees in federally Qualified Health Centers Versus Other Primary Care S ettings\" American Journal of Public Health, Nov 2016). Health centers demonstrate lower total costs for Medicare beneficiaries. Total median annual costs (at $2,370) for health center Medicare patients were lower by 10 percent compared to patients in physician offices ($2,667) and by 30 percent compared to patients in outpatient clinics ($3,580). (Dana B. Mukamel, Laura M. White, Robert S. 71 Nocon, Elbert Ravi Sharma, Leiyu Shi and the Cost of Caring for Medicare Bene ficiaries in Federally Funded Health Centers to Other Care Settings\" Health Services Research , Volume 51, No. 2, April 2016. Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) Program: The Health Center Program administers the FTCA Program, under which participating health centers, their employees and eligible contractors may be deemed to be Federal employees qualified for medical malpractice liability protection under the FTCA. As Federal employees, they are immune from suit for medical malpractice claims while acting with in the scope of their employment. The Federal Government assumes responsibility for such claims. In addition, the FTCA Program supports risk mitigation activities, including reviews of risk management plans and sites visits as well as risk management tec hnical assistance and resources to support health centers. The enactment of the 21 st Century Cures Act in December of 2016 extended liability protections for volunteers at deemed health centers under the FTCA Program. In accordance with the statute, HRSA implemented FTCA coverage for volunteers in FY 2018. Nearly 300 volunteers were covered under the FTCA Program in FY 2020. Overall, in FY 2018, 110 claims were paid totaling $109.3 million, in FY 2019, 150 claims were paid totaling $135 million, and in FY 2020, 117 claims were paid totaling $93.5 million . As the number of health center patients continues to grow, it is projected that the amount of annual claims paid will increase through FY 2023. Funding History FY Amount FY President's Budget Mandatory $3,905,348,00026 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget request for the Health Center Program is $1.8 billion in discretionary resources and includes $3.9 billion in mandatory funding 27, for a total request of $5.7 bil lion, which is an increase of $155.3 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. The FY2021 Omnibus and COVID Relief and Response Act, provided mandatory resources of $4.0 25 FY 2022 reflects the post -sequestration amount of current law mandatory funding. 26 FY 2023 reflects the post -sequestration amount of current law mandatory funding. 27 FY 2023 current law mandatory funding is subject to sequestration. 72 billion for each fiscal year through FY 2023. The Administration continues to be committed to working with the Congress to advance the President's goal of doubling the Federal investment in community health centers, which would help reduce health disparities by expanding access to care. In FY 2023, the Health Center Program wi ll provide care for approximately 30.0 million patients. The FY 2023 Budget provides $85.0 million to support the expansion of early childhood screening and development services in 425 health centers. These awards will ensure the placement of early child hood development experts in each recipient health center, who in coordination with the primary care team will identify whether children are reaching development milestones, address parents' questions and concerns regarding child development, and help conne ct families to additional services when needed. Many children in the U.S., especially children served by health centers, face significant barriers to accessing high quality screening and development services. Expanding early childhood development services provided by health center awardees will increase the likelihood of children succeeding in school once they start kindergarten. As part of the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative, the HRSA Health Center Program provides HIV testing and prevention services, HIV care and treatment where appropriate, and also assists with responding quickly to HIV cluster detection efforts. 28 The HRSA Health Center Programs' primary focus in the EHE initiative is on expanding HIV prevention services, including outreach, c are coordination, and access to Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) -related services to people at high risk for HIV transmission through selected health centers in the identified jurisdictions. In FY 2020, the first year of the Initiative, HRSA provided $54.0 million in resources to 195 health centers that received Health Center/Ryan White Program funding and/or were located in close proximity to a Ryan White Program where no jointly funded health center currently existed in the target jurisdiction. In FY 2021, HRSA awarded approximately $48.0 million to support the participation of 108 additional health centers in the targeted jurisdictions. These health centers have reported that over 151,000 patients received PrEP services in the first year of the EHE Initi ative. In FY 2023, the Budget includes $172 million, an increase of $70.0 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level, which will support participation of an additional 100 health centers. The Budget will support the total participation of approximately 400 health centers in the targeted jurisdictions. The Health Center Program will continue to provide prevention and treatment services to people at high risk for HIV transmission, including Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) -related services, outreach, and care coordination through new grant awards in areas currently served by health centers. The Budget will ensure that current health centers can also continue to provide essential primary health care services to their patient populations, including c ontinuation of supplemental awards initiated in FY 2016 through FY 2019 targeting mental health services and substance use 28 Details on the PrEP Delivery Program to End the HIV Epidemic are included in Mandatory Proposals section of the Departmental Management Congressional Justification. 73 disorder services focusing on the treatment, prevention, and/or awareness of opioid abuse. The FY 2023 Budget Request also supports $120.0 million for the FTCA Program, which is equal to the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. The request supports costs associated with the grant review and award process, operational site visits, information technology, and other program support costs . Health centers continue to be a critical element of the health system, largely because they can provide an accessible and dependable source of high quality, affordable, and cost -effective primary health care services in underserved communities. In pa rticular, health centers emphasize coordinated primary and preventive services that promote reductions in health disparities for low income individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, rural communities, and other underserved populations. Health centers place emphasis on the coordination and comprehensiveness of care, the ability to manage patients with multiple health care needs, and t he use of key quality improvement practices, including HIT. The health center model also overcomes geographic, cultural, linguistic, and other barriers through a team based approach to care that includes physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, dental providers, midwives, behavioral health care providers, social workers, and health educators. Health centers also reduce costs to health systems; the health center model of care has been shown to reduce the use of costlier providers of care, such as EDs and hospitals. In 2016, a study published in the American Journal of Public Health evaluated the total annual health care use and total health care spending of Medicaid (fee -for-service) patients seen at health centers versus those seen a t non-health center settings. 29 This study found that patients seen at a health center had lower health care utilization and spending across all services when compared to non-health center patients. This included 33 percent lower spending on specialty care , 25 percent fewer inpatient admissions, and 24 percent lower total spending overall. Specifically, Medicaid FFS patients seen at a health center saved nearly $2,400 in total health care spending per year when compared to those seen in a non-health center setting. The FY 2023 Request supports the Health Center Program's achievement of its performance targets, including goals on access to affordable, accessible, quality, and cost -effective primary health care services, and the improvement of health outcomes and quality of care. The Health Center Program has established ambitious targets for FY 2023 and beyond. For low birth weight, the Program seeks to be below the national rate. This is ambitious because health centers continue to serve a higher risk pr enatal population than represented nationally in terms of socio- economic, health status and other factors that predispose health center patients to greater risk for LBW and adverse birth outcomes. The FY 2023 target for the program's hypertension measure is that 64 percent of adult patients with diagnosed hypertension will have blood pressure under adequate control. The FY 2023 target for the program's diabetes management measure is 67 percent of adult patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes with most recent hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) under control (less than or equal to 9 percent). 29 Nocon, Robert S. et al. \"Health Care U se and Spending for Medicaid Enrollees in F ederally Qualified Health Centers Versus Other Primary Care Settings\" American Journal of Public Health, Nov 2016 74 The Health Center Program will continue to promote efficient, value -based care, and aims to keep the ratio of medical patients per medical physicians at approximately 1,775 patients. The FY 2023 Request also supports efforts to improve the value, quality, and program integrity in all HRSA -funded programs that deliver direct health care. Health centers annually report on a core set of clinical performance measures that are consistent w ith Healthy People 2020, and include: immunizations; prenatal care; cancer screenings; cardiovascular disease/hypertension; diabetes; weight assessment and counseling for children and adolescents; adult weight screening and follow up; tobacco use assessme nt and counseling; depression screening and follow -up; use; and colorectal cancer screening. In addition to tracking core clinical indicators, health centers report on health outcome measures (low birth weight, diabetes, and hypertension) by race/ethnicity in order to demonstrate progress towards eliminating health disparities in health outcomes. To support quality improvement, the Program will conti nue to facilitate national and State-level technical assistance and training programs that promote quality improvements in health center data and quality reporting, clinical and quality improvement, and implementation of innovative value -based, quality act ivities. The Program continues to promote the integration of HIT into health centers through the Health Center Controlled Network Program to assure that key safety-net providers are able to advance their operations through enhanced technology and tele -health systems. HRSA also utilizes a variety of methods to oversee the Health Center Program and to monitor Health Center Program grantees to identify potential issues, including non-compliance with program requirements and areas where technical assistance m ight be beneficial. HRSA accomplishes this monitoring through a variety of available resources, including the review of health center data reports, independent annual financial audits reports, routine conference calls, and site visits. HRSA's efforts to strengthen evidence -building capacity in the Health Center Program include recent enhancements and modernization to the Uniform Data System (UDS). Patient visits are now reported for both in-person and virtual visits. This data enhancement supports HRSA's efforts to better identify medically underserved population service needs and utilize new technology to improve access to care in medically underserved communities nationwide. The Health Center Program will continue to coordinate with CMS to jointly review section 1115 Medicaid Demonstration Waivers. The Program will continue to work closely with the Department of Justice on the FTCA Program. Additionally, the proposed Budget supports coordination with programs in the Departments of Housing and Urban D evelopment, Education, and Justice.

Allocation Method ............................................................................................................. Other Program Description and Accomplishments The Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program encourages health care providers to volunteer their time at qualified free clinics by providing medical malpractice protection at sponsoring health clinics, t hus expanding the capacity of the health care safety net. In many communities, free clinics assist in meeting the health care needs of the uninsured and underserved. They provide a venue for providers to volunteer their services. Most free clinics are s mall organizations with annual budgets of less than $250,000. In FY 2004, Congress provided first -time funding for payments of free clinic provider's claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The appropriation established the Free Clinics Medical M alpractice Judgment Fund and extended FTCA coverage to medical professional volunteers in free clinics in order to expand access to health care services for low -income individuals in medically underserved areas. Allocation Method: Qualifying free clinics submit applications to the Department of Health and Human Services to deem providers that they sponsor. Qualifying free clinics (or health care facilities operated by nonprofit private entities) must be licensed or certified in accordance with applicable law regarding the provision of health services. To qualify under the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program, the clinic cannot: accept reimbursements from any third -party payor (including reimbursement under any insurance policy or health plan, or under any Federal or State health benefits program including Medicare or Medicaid); or impose charges on the individuals to whom the services are provided; or impose charges according to the ability of the individual involved to pay the charge. Increasing Access: In FY 2020, 11,291 health care providers received Federal malpractice insurance through the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program, exceeding the Program target. 79 In FY 2018, 239 clinics operated with FTCA deemed clinicians; in FY 2019, 236 clinics participated; and in FY 2020, 230 clinics participated, exceeding the program target in each year. Promoting Efficiency: The Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program is committed to improving overall efficiency by controlling the Federal administrative costs necessary to deem each provider. By restraining these annual administrative costs, the Program is able to provide an increasing number of clinicians with malpractice coverage, thus building the free clinic workforce capacity nationwide and increasing access to care for the target populations served by these clinics. In FY 2018 costs were $38 per provider; in FY 2019 costs were $22 per provider, and in FY 2020 costs were $38 per provider. In each year, the Program performance target has been exceeded. In FY 2020, there were no paid claims under the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program. There is 1 claim currently outstanding, and the Program Fund has a current balance of approximately $3.9 million. Funding History FY Amount $1,000,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget for the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program is $1.0 million, which is equal to the FY 2022 Continuing Resol ution level. The request will support the Program's continued achievement of its performance targets addressing its goal of maintaining access and capacity in the health care safety net. The funding request also includes costs associated with information technology and other program support costs. Targets for FY 2023 focus on maintaining FY 2022 target levels for the number of volunteer free clinic health care providers deemed eligible for FTCA malpractice coverage at 11,000, while also maintaining the number of free clinics operating with FTCA deemed clinicians at 220. The Program will also continue to promote efficiency by restraining growth in the annual Federal administrative costs necessary to deem each provider, with a target of $75 administrative cost per provider in FY 2023. The FY 2023 request will also support the Program's continued coordination and collaboration with related Federal programs in order to further leverage and promote efforts to increase the capacity of the health care safety net. Areas of collaboration include coordination with the Health Center FTCA Program, also administered by HRSA, to share program expertise. In addition, the two programs control costs by sharing a contract to process future claims, and by providing technical support and outreach. The Program will coordinate with non-profit free clinic -related umbrella groups on issues related to program information dissemination and 80 outreach and will continue to collaborate with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the HHS Office of General Counsel (HHS/OGC) to assist in drafting items including deeming applications and related policies. The Program continues to work with the HHS/OGC to answer legal technical assistance issues raised by free clinics in the Program and clinics interested in joining the Program. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

Other (Competitive Awards to Individuals) Program Description and Accomplishments: Since its inception in 1972, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) has worked to increase access to care in underserved areas by supporting qualified health care providers dedicated to working in underserved communities in urban, rural, and tribal areas. Across the nation, NHSC clinicians serve patients in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). As of September 30, 2021, there were 6,272 primary care HPSAs, 5,678 dental HPSAs, and 5,391 mental health HPSAs . The National Health Service Corps provides scholarships and loan repayment for clinicians who commit to practice in underserved communities. NHSC -approved sites provide care to individuals regardless of their ability to pay. As of September 30, 2021, there are nearly 20,000 primary care medical, dental, and mental and behavioral health practitioners - the largest cohort ever - serving in the NHSC across nearly 20,000 approved sites across the United States. Eligible sites include facilities such as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and FQHC Look-Alikes, American Indian and Native Alaska health clinics, rural health clinics, school -based clinics, and community mental health centers . The American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act in FY 2021 appropriated $800 million to the NHSC, $700 million of which is for the NHSC Scholarship Program (SP), Loan Repayment Programs (LRPs), and Students to Service (S2S) LRP , which are described below. These funds enabled the NHSC 83 to award all qualified applicants to the N HSC SP, LRPs, and S2S LRP; the remainder of these funds will be fully obligated in FY 2022. The ARP Act provided the remaining $100 million to the State Loan Repayment Program (SLRP) (see below); these funds will support a new four - year grant cycle beginning in FY 2022. The National Health Service Corps programs include: NHSC Scholarship Program (SP): The NHSC SP provides financial support through scholarships, including tuition, other reasonable education expenses, and a monthly living stipend to health professions students committed to providing primary care in underserved communities of greatest need. The NHSC SP provides a supply of clinicians who will be available over the next one to eight years, depending on the length of their education and traini ng programs. Upon completion of training, NHSC Scholars become salaried employees of NHSC - approved sites in underserved communities. NHSC Loan Repayment Program (LRP): The NHSC LRP offers fully -trained primary care clinicians the opportunity to receive assistance to pay off qualifying educational loans in exchange for service in a HPSA. In exchange for an initial two years of service, loan repayers receive up to $50,000 in loan repayment assistance. The NHSC LRP recruits clinicians as they complete train ing and are immediately available for service, as well as seasoned professionals seeking an opportunity to serve in the nation's underserved communities. The NHSC is collaborating with several HRSA funded workforce programs to bolster the primary care an d behavioral health workforce in rural and underserved communities. NHSC Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Workforce LRP: The NHSC received a dedicated appropriation to expand and improve access to quality opioid and SUD treatment in rural and underserved ar eas nationwide in a variety of settings including Opioid Treatment Programs, Office-based Opioid Treatment Facilities, and Non-opioid Outpatient SUD facilities. The funding supports the recruitment and retention of health professionals needed in underserved areas to provide evidence -based SUD treatment and prevent overdose deaths. Providers receive loan repayment assistance to reduce their educational financial debt in exchange for service at SUD treatment facilities. Eligible SUD providers include: Allop athic/Osteopathic physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants with Drug Addiction Treatment Act 2000 Waivers; Licensed or certified health professionals providing SUD services; and Licensed primary care and mental & behavioral health professiona ls. NHSC Rural Community LRP: A portion of the appropriations provides funding for the NHSC Rural Community LRP, a program for providers working to combat the opioid epidemic in the nation's rural communities. The NHSC Rural Community LRP has made loan r epayment awards in coordination with the Rural Communities Opioid Response Program initiative within the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) to provide evidence -based substance use treatment, assist in recovery, and to prevent overdose deaths across the nation. 84 Both the NHSC SUD Workforce LRP and the NHSC Rural Community LRP will continue to make FY 2023 awards to clinicians who are combating the opioid crisis in rural and underserved communities . NHSC and the Indian Health Service (IHS): Funding has been directed to support awards in the aforementioned NHSC LRPs to both fully-trained medical, nursing, and dental clinicians, behavioral/mental health clinicians, and SUD providers, to deliver health care services in Indian Health Service facilities, Tribally -Operated 638 Health Programs, and Urban Indian Health Programs (ITUs). Federal Indian Health Service Clinics, Tribal Health Clinics, Urban Indian Health Programs, and dually-funded Tribal Health Clinics/Community Health Centers are automatically designated as HPSAs. With this directed funding, the NHSC has awarded all eligible clinicians serving in ITUs who have applied to the NHSC LRPs. Service (S2S) LRP: The NHSC LRP provides loan repayment assistance of up to $120,000 to allopathic and osteopathic medical students, certified nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and dental students in their last year of school in return for a three -year commitment to provide primary health care in rural and urban HPSA s of greatest need. This program was established with the goal of increasing the number of physicians, certified nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and dentists in the NHSC pipeline. State Loan Repayment Program (SLRP): The SLRP is a federal -state partnership grant program that has traditionally required a dollar -for-dollar match from the state that enters into loan repayment contracts with clinicians who practice in a HPSA in that state. The program serves as a complement to the NH SC and provides flexibility to states to help meet their unique primary care workforce needs. States have the discretion to focus on one, some, or all of the eligible primary care disciplines eligible within the NHSC and may also include pharmacists and registered nurses. States receiving funding from this opportunity are encouraged to allow health professionals to practice to the full extent of their license. In FY 2022, HRSA will continue to support SLRP grantees through additional flexibilities author ized by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. These flexibilities included waiving the matching funds requirement and allowing up to 10 percent of grant funds to be spent on administrative costs, which will provide further incentives for states to partici pate in the program. Collectively, these programs serve the immediate needs (through loan repayers) of underserved communities and support the development of a pipeline (through Scholars and Students to Service awardees) to meet the needs of these communit ies upon completion of their training. The tables below show the students in the NHSC pipeline who are training to serve the underserved and the number and type of primary care providers currently serving in the NHSC who are providing care in underserved areas. 85 NHSC Student Pipeline by Program as of 09/30/2021 Programs Students Scholarship Program 2,043 Students to Service Program 480 Total 2,523 NHSC Student Pipeline by Discipline as of 09/30/2021 Disciplines Students Allopathic/Osteopath ic Physicians 1,054 Dentists 630 Nurse Practitioners 280 Physician Assistants 511 Certified Nurse Midwives 48 Total 2,523 NHSC Field Strength by Program as of 09/30/2021 Programs Clinicians Scholarship Program Clinicians 671 Loan Repayment Progra m Clinicians 12,321 State Loan Repayment Program Clinicians 2,246 SUD Workforce Loan Repayment Program Clinicians 3,066 Rural Community Loan Repayment Program Clinicians 1,226 Students to Service Loan Repayment Program Participants 454 Total 19,984 NHSC Field Strength by Discipline as of 09/30/2021 Disciplines Clinicians Allopathic/Osteopathic Physicians 2,622 Dentists 1,750 Dental Hygienists 467 Nurse Practitioners 3,833 Physician Assistants 1,542 Nurse Midwives 241 Mental and Behavioral Hea lth Professionals 9,346 Other State Loan Repayment Program Clinicians 183 Total 19,984 86 Average NHSC New Award by Program as of 09/30/2021 Program Average Award Amount Scholarship Program $245,323 Students to Service Loan Repayment Program $105,149 Loan Repayment Programs $40,906 The 2-year retention rate among NHSC participants who completed their service obligation in FY 2019 is 82 percent. The 1-year retention rate among NHSC participants who completed their service obligation in FY 2020 is 84 percent. The Health Workforce Clinician Dashboard calculates retention rates for NHSC providers. 30 The Clinician Dashboard uses National Provider Identifier numbers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a baseline, in conjunction with other data sources, to determine the current practice locations of providers who previously served in the NHSC allowing HRSA to calculate and provide a more accurate retention rate that is not dependent on survey response rates.

The COE Program provides grants to health professions schools and other public and nonprofit health or educational entities to serve as innovative resource and education centers for the recru itment, training, and retention of underrepresented minority (URM) students and faculty. These award recipients also focus on facilitating faculty and student research on health issues particularly affecting URM groups. In addition, the COE Program aims to improve clinical education and cultural competence for minority health issues and social determinants of health. Through strategic partnerships, grant recipients increase the applicant pool of URM students within health professions schools, establish and expand programs to enhance academic performance of these students, and utilize stipends to assist URM students and faculty with financial support. In FY 2021, the COE Program supported 19 grantees. In FY 2022, the COE Program anticipates supporting approximately 19 grantees. In FY 2023, the COE Program anticipates supporting approximately 34 grantees, which is 15 grantees above the FY 2022 number. In Academic Year (AY) 2020 -2021, the COE Program supported 142 training programs and activities designed to prepare individuals either to apply to a health professions training program or to maintain enrollment in such programs. Award recipients offered programming focused on mentorship and academic support, as well as faculty recruitment and development. These programs provided 1,534 trainees across the country with stipend support. In addition, 69 percent of the trainees were from financially and/or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. Additional students participated in COE Programs throughout the academic year, increasing total participation to 5,240 students Awardees partnered with 200 health care delivery sites to provide 3,590 clinical training experiences to health professions trainees. COE clinical experiences are designed to help 93 prepare health professions students to provide quality health care to diverse populations. The training emphasizes the importance of cultural competency and the impact of health disparities on overall health outcomes. Approximately 48 percent of training sites used by COE awardees were primary care settings and 45 percent were in medically underserved communities. Awardees also provided 56 faculty development activities, which provided training to 1,028 faculty members. From AY 2015-2016 to AY 2019-2020,COE awardees trained over 30,000 students and reported over 16,000 program completers. Over the five -year period, the percentage of students who received academic or career advising services increased from 52 percent in AY 2015 -2016 to 83 percent in AY 2019-2020 a nd the percentage of students who received counseling services increased from 48 percent in AY 2015-2016 to 66 percent in AY 2019-2020. Awardees supported 681 experiential training sites in 36 states or territories. COEs also trained 7,900 faculty through faculty development training programs and activities.

FY 2023 Authorization ............................................................................................. $15,000,000 Allocation Method ..........................................................................................Competitive Grant Program Description and Accomplishments : The National H ealth Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP) Academies, authorized in 1972, provides individuals from economically and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds an opportunity to develop the skills needed to successfully compete for, enter, and graduate from schools of health professions or allied health professions. . The National HCOP Academies provide a variety of academic and social supports to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds through formal academic and research training, programming, and student enhancement or support services. The support provided includes tailored academic counseling and highly focused mentoring services, student financial assistance in the form of scholarships and stipends, financial planning resources, and health care career s and training information. The ultimate goal of HCOP is to provide a pathway for disadvantaged individuals to enter the health professions and equip them to deliver high quality, culturally competent care to underserved individuals. HCOP activities are an integral part of structured programming for students throughout the academic year. Activities of HCOP grantees include post -baccalaureate, summer, and other programs that provide students with knowledge, experiences, and opportunities to participate in individualized and tailored academic coursework and community work in the health professions school areas. In addition, the HCOP National Ambassador Program, a longitudinal, integrated curriculum -based program, provides assistance to students from disadva ntaged backgrounds while matriculating through the educational pipeline. The current five -year project period ends on August 31, 2023. In Academic Year (AY) 2020 -2021, National HCOP Academies offered 169 curricula -based structured programs and non-curric ula-based stand-alone activitie s to 3,535 students in the health professions pipeline, almost 70 percent of whom self -identified as underrepresented minorities. This figure includes 2,887 disadvantaged trainees that Academies reached through structured programs such as the HCOP National Ambassadors Program. Forty-three percent of students 100 (1,515) in structured programs and stand-alone activities completed their training during this time period. HCOP awardees also partnered with 188 sites to provide 2,740 clinical health professional trainings in primary care, emphasizing experiences in rural and underserved communities for HCOP student trainees (e.g., academic institutions, community-based organizations, and hospitals). Approximately 47 percent of these training sites were located in medically underserved communities and/or rural settings. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, 28 percent of training sites offered COVID -19 related services. From AY 2015-2016 to AY 2019-2020, HCOP awardees trained approxi mately 4,000 to 8,500 students per year, reaching a total of 19,984 unique students during the five year period. HCOP awardees distributed over $12.7 million in stipends to post -secondary students, providing stipend support to 88 percent of post -secondary students in structured HCOP programs. Furthermore, 21,000 students gained exposure to health care settings or hands -on experience at HCOP's 519 field placement sites. Overall, HCOP participants accumulated 550,179 training hours in medically underserved communities, 83,582 training hours in primary care settings, and 43,729 training hours in rural areas. For high school -aged disadvantaged students in structured HCOP programs, 1,672 (80 percent) graduated from high school on time, exceeding the national high school graduation rate for students with low incomes (78 percent). 45 For post -secondary disadvantaged students in structured HCOP programs, 2,623 (89 percent) earned their degrees on time. Among those students for whom degree data was available, near ly 100 percent graduated on time, vastly exceeding the national graduation rates for students earning associate's (33 percent), bachelor's (63 percent), master's (61 percent), and professional (77 percent) degrees. 46,47 Eligible Entities : Accredited healt h professions schools and other public or private nonprofit health or educational institutions. 45 Note that HCOP participants are economically disadvantaged and/or educationally disadvantaged, so the comparison between state graduation rates for low -income students and HCOP students is not completely equivalent. 46 Associate's and bachelor's graduation rates are based on completi on within 150 percent of normal time to degree. Associate's degree data comes from a cohort that entered their degree program in 2016, and bachelor's degree data comes from a cohort that began their degree in 2013. HCOP uses a similar time frame for \"on -time\" completion for both degree types. National Center for Education Statistics. 2021. The Condition of Education 2021. 47 Master's and professional degree data comes from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study, 1993 -2003. Participants completed their bachelor's degree in AY 92 -93 and were followed until 2003, so \"on -time\" degree completion in this contex t means within the ten years that elapsed between college graduation and study follow -up. HCOP defines \"on -time\" for professional degrees as complet ion within five years, but it does not define \"on -t ime\" for master's degrees.

FY 2023 Authorization ...............................................................................................$5,663,000 Allocation Method ............................................................................ Competitive Grant/Contract Program Description and Accomplishments : Since the nation's health care system is constantly changing and preparing new providers requires long lead times, it is critical to have high quality projections to ensure a workforce of sufficient size and skills capable of meeting the nation's health care needs. Policymakers and other decision makers need high quality information about the health workforce that incorporates up-to -date research, modeling, and trends. The National Center for Health Workforce Analysis (NCHWA) collects and analyzes health workforce data and information in order to provide national and state policy makers, researchers, and the public with information on health workforce supply and demand. NCHWA also evaluates the effectiveness of HRSA's workforce investments. NCHWA focuses on: Providing timely reports and data on the current state and trends of the U.S. health workforce; Build ing national capacity for health workforce data collection by working with federal agencies, professional associations, and others to develop and promote guidelines for data collection and analysis; Improving tools for data management, analysis, modeling, and projection to support research, policy analysis, and decision making, as well as evaluation of the effectiveness of workforce programs and policies; Responding to information and data needs by translating data and findings to inform policies and progr ams; and Analyzing grantee performance data and evaluating Bureau of Health Workforce's programs. 104 In FY 2023, NCHWA will continue to model supply and demand of health professionals across a range of health occupations, and metro and non-metro geographies, making these assessments of the adequacy of the health workforce available through reports and online tools. NCHWA publicly released a new interactive projection visualization tool in FY 2021 that incorporates recent projection data. The new Primary Car e Provider Projections are displayed in that dashboard. In lieu of reports, the projection visualization tool will be the primary means to disseminate workforce projections data. The most recent projection updates include: Primary Care Provider Projections, 2018-2030 Women's Health Service Provider Projections, 2018-2030 Oral Health Workforce Projections, 2017-2030 In FY 2023, NCHWA will continue to oversee nine Health Workforce Research Centers (HWRC) that conduct and disseminate research and data analysis on health workforce issues of national importance, and provide technical assistance to regional and local entities on workforce data collection, analysis, and reporting. 49 Together, these nine Centers will examine a broad range of issues related to various sectors of the health care workforce, including (but not limited to) occupations in Oral Health, Long Term Services and Supports, Allied Health, Behavioral Health, emerg ing health workforce issues, and health equity in health workforce education and training. NCHWA is planning to fund nine centers in the new grant cycle, which includes a new public health workforce research center. Research conducted by these HWRCs aims to strengthen the evidence base for effective education and training programs that can enable and empower a health workforce capable of fostering and ensuring health equity for all populations. Examples of research include: Looking across a range of hea lth care professions and providers to develop a comprehensive picture of how current health workforce education and training programs incorporate consideration of health equity, including social needs, social determinants of health, and related elements, i nto their programs. Developing a deeper understanding of the current behavioral health workforce and its readiness related to addressing the current opioid and overdose crisis. Investigating in real -time the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on sectors of the U.S. health workforce, such as long term services and support occupations. Evaluating health workforce education and training programs to understand their impact on increasing access to primary care; mitigating provider shortages in underserved areas ; delivering integrated primary, behavioral, and oral health care; addressing health workforce diversity; and strengthening community/provider partnerships. In FY 2023, NCHWA will continue to maintain the Area Health Resources Files (AHRF) dataset. AHRF is updated annually and contains detailed information on health professions, 49 In FY 2019, one Health Workforce Research Center administered by NCHWA was funded from the Bureau of Primary Health Care. 105 health facilities, and the population from a variety of sources. NCHWA publicly released an AHRF dashboard and is planning to release a diversity module of the dashboard in FY 2022. In FY 2023, NCHWA will continue to develop a projection model that allows a more sophisticated analysis and projection of health workforce supply and demand, taking into account changing national demographics, the demand for health care services, and the impact those changes have on the delivery of health care. In an effort to better understand and demonstrate the outcomes of BHW programs, NCHWA has been developing and publicly releasing Program Accomplishment and Outcomes reports for grant programs overseen by the Bureau of Health Workforce. The eleven reports released in FY 2021 highlight the ways in which BHW programs have impacted access, supply, distribution, and quality of the health workforce.

Cour ses covered topics such as Alzheimer's disease/dementia (23 percent), geriatric health (22 percent ), and evidence -based practice in a clinical setting (7 percent). In addition, GWEP awardees supported health care professionals by providing over 4,500 hour s of training across 1,857 continuing education courses. Nearly 520,000 health care professionals participated in GWEP -sponsored continuing education courses and approximately 16 percent of these professionals were employed in medically underserved communitie s. Thirty -nine percent of GWEP continuing education courses focused on Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. Furthermore, GWEP awardees supported 483 faculty-focused training programs and activities, reaching 9,912 faculty-level trainees. GWEP s ignificantly outperformed nearly all of its targets this year, sponsoring 721 Alzheimer's disease and dementia-related educational offerings (6.I.C.12), training 180,938 individuals through Alzheimer's disease and dementia -related educational offerings (6. I.C.13), reaching 519,356 geriatrics professionals through continuing education programs (6.I.C.32), and providing 69,518 students with geriatric -focused training in settings across the care continuum (6.I.C.33). The targets were 150; 10,000; 50,000; and 10,000 respectively. Awardees also reached 721,148 trainees through curricula related to treating health problems in elderly individuals, exceeding the FY 2020 target (not depicted in the program activity table) of 140,000 trainees. This shift occurred because awardees moved to online courses for health care professionals and to telehealth-based training for students unable to access clinical training sites. Awardees also established new relationships with the nation's 15,000+ nursing homes in response t o COVID -19's impact on nursing homes and geriatric patients. These awardees leveraged the new delivery modes and relationships to expand their activities, such as offering online continuing education courses on Alzheimer's disease and dementia to nursing home -based health care providers. In FY 2021, the GWEP program received an additional $2 million in annual appropriations. The funding provided COVID -19 specific education and training to the nursing home workforce in order to improve care to nursing hom e residents. GWEP awardees used COVID-19 supplemental funding to offer a variety of courses and continuing education classes to help students and professionals respond to the COVID -19 pandemic. With this supplemental funding, awardees developed or enhanced 979 courses for nearly 470,000 students, including 149 courses on geriatric health and 74 courses on telehealth in clinical settings. GWEP awardees also offered nearly 3,000 hours of continuing education across 668 classes, reaching over 360,000 individua ls. Fifty -four percent of these trainings addressed issues related to Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Awardees also reached 4,501 faculty -level trainees through 129 faculty-focused training programs and activities. The National and Regional Projections of Supply and Demand for Geriatricians: 2013 -2025 report by HRSA's National Center for Health Workforce Analysis proj ected demand for 130 geriatricians will exceed supply, resulting in a national shortage of 26,980 full time equivalent positions in 2025.60 The report states all regions of the U.S. are projected to have a 2025 shortage of geriatricians, although the degree of shortage in each region is variable.61 The education and training of health professionals in the area of geriatrics are hindered by a shortage of faculty, inadequate and variable academic curricula and clinical experiences, and a lack of opportunities for advanced training. In order to address these issues, faculty with expertise in geriatrics are needed to train the workforce to provide specialized care to improve health outcomes for older adults. Consequently, in FY 2019, HRSA funded the Geriatrics Academic Career Awards (GACA) Program to support the career development of junior faculty in geriatrics at accredited schools of allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, nursing, social work, psychology, dentistry, pharmacy, or allied health. Faculty with e xpertise in geriatrics are needed to train the workforce and provide specialized care to improve health outcomes for older adults. Under the GACA program, career development awards were made to support individual junior faculty who will provide interprofe ssional clinical training and become leaders in academic geriatrics. The goals of the program are for the GACA candidate to develop the necessary skills to lead health care transformation in a variety of settings. These settings include rural and/or medi cally underserved settings, as well as age -friendly settings that provide interprofessional training in clinical geriatrics. In Academic Year 2020 -2021, GACA supported the career development of 25 junior faculty in geriatric medicine (52 percent), family and internal medicine (12 percent), advanced practice nursing in gerontology (8 percent), occupational and physical therapy (8 percent), social work and addiction counseling (8 percent), geriatric psychiatry (4 percent), general dentistry (4 percent) and pharmacy (4 percent). Sixty-four percent of GACA recipients provided clinical services in primary care settings (2,359 contact hours), 52 percent provided services in medically underserved communities (1,975 contact hours), and 24 percent provided service s in rural areas (459 contact hours). GACA -supported junior faculty published 37 articles, gave 97 conference presentations, and received 36 research or education grants, including six grants worth $100,000 or more. Approximately 96 percent of GACA awardees received training in a setting that offered telehealth, and 40 percent received training in opioid use treatment. Furthermore, 68 percent of GACA faculty received COVID -19 related training, and 56 percent received training on health equity/the social determinants of health. GACA awardees developed or enhanced 646 different courses for students and 579 courses for faculty members, reaching a total of 30,177 students and 25,019 faculty members. In FY 2023, the 4 th and final year of the current GACA cohort (24), will receive funding. In FY 2023, HRSA anticipates issuing a new Notice of Funding Opportunity to hold a new GACA grant competition. 60 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, National Center for Health Workforce Analysis. 2017.

The behavioral health workforce includes a range of providers who promote mental health, resilience and wellbeing; the treatment of mental and substance use disorders; and the support of those who experience and/or are in recovery from these conditions, along with their families and communit ies. The behavioral health workforce functions in a wide range of prevention, health care, and social service settings. There is a shortage of behavioral health providers; as of December 31 st, 2021, over 136 million Americans live in a designated mental Health Professional Shortage Area.63 HRSA's 2020 Behavioral Health Workforce Projections Report estimated national level health workforce needs for several behavioral health occupations between 2017 and 2030. The report estimated the demand for addiction counselors is expected to increase 15 percent by 2030, with demand exceeding supply and leading to a deficit of addiction counselors of approximately 11,530 FTE. Also, the report estimated that by 2030, the supply of psychiatrists is expected to decrease by approximately 20 percent. The COVID -19 pandemic exacerbates the existing imbalance in supply of and demand for mental and behavioral health providers across the U.S. HRSA uses projections data and other information about the behavioral health workforce to develop and adjust programs to ensure that they are responsive to the Nation's emerging needs. 63 U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration, \"Designated HPSA Quarterly Summary, First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022.\" Available at https://data.hrsa.gov/Default/GenerateHPSAQuarterlyReport . 136 The COVID -19 pandemic has increased the need for behavioral health providers. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation Issue Brief64 explored the dual impacts of efforts to reduce the spread of COVID -19 on behavioral health: the economic downturn has increased stress and vulnerability to behavioral health conditions at the same time isolating and quarantining have reduced access to behavioral health services. T he Issue Brief noted that: \"A broad body of research links social isolation and loneliness to poor mental health; and recent data shows that significantly higher shares of people who were sheltering in place (47 percent) reported negative mental health eff ects resulting from worry or stress related to coronavirus than among those not sheltering in place (37 percent). Negative mental health effects due to social isolation may be particularly pronounced among older adults and households with adolescents, as these groups are already at risk for depression or suicidal ideation. Research shows that job loss is associated with increased depression, anxiety, distress, and low self -esteem and may lead to higher rates of substance use disorder and suicide. Recent p olling data shows that more than half of the people who lost income or employment reported negative mental health impacts from worry or stress over coronavirus; and lower income people report higher rates of major negative mental health impacts compared to higher income people.\" In the context of the COVID -19 pandemic, there were over 104,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States during the12-month period ending in September 2021. Such deaths have increased approximately ten-fold since 1980. Opioids, particularly fentanyl, are the chief drug involved in these deaths, though non-opioid drugs also contribute. 64 Panchal, Nirmita, et al.

Education $19,000,000 $19,000,000 Workforce Development Programs 65 $149,916,000 $149,916,000 $397,374,000 +$247,458,000 The Behavioral Health Workforce Development (BHWD) Programs support a number of activities to expand the behavioral workforce as well as enhance the training of the pipeline and current workforce. In FY 2023, these Programs will support a number of activities, which are described below. Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training (BHWET) Programs: In FY 2023, the Budget includes $225.8 million for BHWET, a $172.5 million increase over the FY 2022 CR level. HRSA anticipates making $60.5 million in continuation awards and $165.3 million in new awards for BHWET in FY 2023. BHW ET increases the number of behavioral health providers entering and continuing practice, with special emphasis on prevention and clinical intervention and treatment for those at risk of developing mental and substance use disorders, and the involvement of families in t he prevention and treatment of behavioral health conditions. BHW ET includes t he activities described below. BHW ET Program for Professionals: The BHWET Program for Professionals aims to increase the supply of behavioral health professionals while also improving distribution of a quality behavioral health workforce and thereby increasing access to behavioral health services. In FY 2022, HRSA supported 168 BHWET Professional grantees. Further, 56 of the BHWET Professional grantees were funded through the American Rescue Plan Act. These additional BHWET awards will result in increasing the supply of behavioral health professionals throughout the nation. BHWET Program for Paraprofessionals: The BHWET Program for Paraprofessionals develops and expands community-based experiential training to increase the supply of students preparing to become peer support specialists and other behavioral health-related 65 Includes appropriati ons from both MBHET and BHW ET lines. 138 paraprofessionals while also improving distribution of a quality behavioral health workforce. In FY 2022, HRSA supported 44 Paraprofessional grantees. Behavioral Health Integration into Community -Based Settings: In 2023, the Budget includes $10.0 million to support a new pilot program to promote the healthy social and emotional development and behavior al health needs of families in communities that are traditionally underserved or are part of a Mental Health Professional Shortage Area. Specifically, this pilot will provide grants to community-based organizations or local health departments to train community partners and integrate navigators and community health workers in non-traditional community settings where they live, learn, and play. Award recipients would identify, engage, and provide Mental Health First Aid or similar training to community partners, such as social services providers, after -school care and sports programs, community organizations (e.g., the YMCA), boys and girls clubs, recreation and summer care programs, library systems, independent daycares, and local parent/caregiver groups, among others. Recipients will also integrate navigators and community health workers into these and other community settings to link to local resources, such as medical homes (including HRSA -funded health centers), school -based and other community-based organizations, public health departments, and local community social supports and services. This funding will support 30 grants and complements $40 million in the MCH Block Grant for a total investment of $50 million. The $40 million in the MCHB Block Grant will support a pilot initiative to integrate behavioral health supports in community settings to promote the healthy social and emotional development and mental health needs of mothers, children and their families. Funding for BHWET will increase the supply of behavioral health professionals and paraprofessionals, including community health workers, while also improving distribution of a quality behavioral health workforce and thereby increasing access to behavioral health services. A special focus is pla ced on the knowledge and understanding of children, adolescents, and transitional -aged youth at risk for a mental health disorder, Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED), and/or substance use disorder. The programs also seeks to establish and expand field placements, internships, and experiential sites, especially among children and youth focused community-based partners able to conduct trainings in school -based settings. HRSA also proposes to increase funding to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions to train behavioral health providers. HRSA will continue to require grantees to prioritize linguistic competencies to ensure these additional funds expand the supply of behavioral health professionals and paraprofessional s who speak languages other than English. In Academic Year 2020 -2021, the BHWET Programs supported training for 6,454 individuals, 57 percent of whom came from underrepresented minority or disadvantaged backgrounds. Awardees trained 3,356 graduate -level social workers, psychologists, school and clinical counselors, psychiatric nurse practitioners, and marriage and family therapists, as well as 3,098 students preparing to become behavioral health paraprofessionals (e.g., community health workers, outreach workers, social services aides, mental health workers, substance abuse/addictions workers, youth workers, and peer paraprofessionals). By the end of the Academic Year, 4,828 students graduated from degree and certificate-bearing programs and entered the behavioral health workforce, and BHWET has produced 7,493 new community health workers, peer paraprofessionals, and substance use/addictions workers since the program was established in 2014. Forty-eight percent of graduates who provided one -year follow -up data 139 were employed in or pursuing further training in medically underserved communities; 21 percent were providing treatment or wraparound services for individuals with substance use disorders; and 16 percent were employed at Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, or FQHCs or Look-alikes. BHWET awardees partnered with 2,354 training sites to provide 5,402 clinical training experiences for BHWET student trainees. Approximately 72 percent of these training sites were located in medically underserved commun ities, where trainees provided over 1.3 million hours of behavioral health services to patients and clients. BHWET awardees also developed or enhanced 2,513 behavioral health-related courses and training activities, reaching nearly 57,000 students and advanced trainees (i.e., psychology interns and fellows and psychiatry residents). In fall 2020, HRSA conducted an evaluation of BHWET by administering surveys to BHWET awardees, trainees, and partner sites. Evaluators found that 75 percent of awardees repo rted partnering with new sites through social services and referrals to provide training on opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment, indicating that the BHWET Program helped enhance academic and community partnerships. In addition, almost all (89 percent) of t rainees sought to work in a rural or underserved community because of the opportunity to apply a diverse skill set and 92 percent said training in an underserved area influenced their decision to work in a rural or underserved community upon program comple tion. Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training -Community Improvement Program (BHWET-CIP): In FY 2023, the Budget includes $52.7 million for a new activity to develop and expand community-based experiential training through internships and field placements to increase the supply of students preparing to become behavioral health professionals and behavioral health-related paraprofessionals including trainees ready to support individuals involved, or at risk of being involved in the criminal justice system. The Program focuses on reducing the stigmatization of persons with mental illness and/or substance use disorders through training behavioral health trainees and relevant community partners to appropriately address the needs of individuals during a behavioral health crisis. The Behavioral Health Workforce Development Technical Assistance and Evaluation (BHWD TAE) Program: In FY 2023, the Budget includes $2.5 million to support one continuation award to fund the BHWD TAE Program which develops a nd provides tailored technical assistance to current and future grant recipients in the BHWET -Professionals, BHWET -Paraprofessionals, OWEP - Professionals, Addiction Medicine Fellowship (AMF) Program: In FY 2023, the Budget includes $24.0 million, an increase of $4.3 million over the FY 2022 CR level for the AMF Program. This funding will support 43 continuation awards. The AMF Program seeks to increase the number of board-certified addiction medicine and addict ion psychiatry specialists trained in providing interprofessional behavioral health services, including OUD and SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery services, in underserved, community-based settings. The AMF Program is designed to foster robust community -based clinical training of addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry physicians in underserved, community-based settings who see patients at various access points of care and provide addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery services across health care sectors. 140 In Academic Year 2020 -2021, the first year the AMF program provided data, awardees trained 98 fellows in addiction medicine, including 63 graduates. Eighty-four were Addiction Medicine Fellows (of which 53 graduated) and 14 were Addiction Psychiatry Fellows (of which 10 graduated). The fellows represented the following disciplines: internal medicine (27), family medicine (24), psychiatry (20), and other medical disciplines (27) such as preventive medicine and pediatrics. Throughout the year, the fellows recorded over 61,000 hours of training and nearly 80,000 patient encounters in medically underserved communities. Upon graduation, eighty-one percent of AMF fellows indicated that they intend to serve individuals with opioid use disorder or substance use disorder, and 52 percent indicated that they intend to work in a medically underserved community. AMF awardees also supported 234 experiential training sites. Eighty-nine percent of sites provided interprofessional education, 68 percent of sites were located in medically underserved communities, and 28 percent were located in primary care settings. L astly, the AMF program offered faculty development training programs and activities to over 840 faculty. Integrated Substance Use Disorder Treatment Program (ISTP) : In 2023, the Budget includes $11.6 million for ISTP, which is equal to the FY 2022 CR level. In FY 2021, HRSA awarded 5 awards totaling $11.6 million for 5 years to expand the number of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, health service psychologists, and social workers trained to provide mental health and SUD services in underserve d community-based settings that integrate primary care and mental health and SUD services. The ISTP Program fosters robust clinical training and augment expertise among clinicians who will see patients at access points of care and provides addiction preve ntion, treatment, and recovery services. Participants will be practicing professionals from the following disciplines: nurse practitioners, physician assistants, health service psychol ogists, and/or social workers. Opioid -Impacted Family Support Program (OIFSP): In FY 2023, the Budget includes $16.8 million for OIFSP, which is equal to the FY 2022 CR level . This funding will support 28 continuation awards . OIFSP trains paraprofessionals to support children and families impacted by OUD and other SUD in underserved areas. The Program also provides professional development opportunities and educational support to increase the number of paraprofessional trainees receiving a certificate u pon completion of the Program. OIFSP awardees also supported a total of 552 paraprofessionals, 88 percent of whom received funding. Thirty-nine percent were underrepresented minorities, 27 percent were from rural backgrounds, and 55 percent were from disadvantaged backgrounds. These paraprofessionals trained on substance use treatment (71 percent) and opioid use treatment (64 percent). Forty- seven percent received training in health equity and/or the social determinants of health. OIFSP awardees supported 132 experiential training sites, which provided training to 388 people. Eighty-four percent of these sites were in medically underserved communities, 30 percent were in rural settings and 28 percent were in primary care se ttings. Sixty-eight percent of these sites offered substance use treatment services, 58 percent offered opioid use treatment services, and 51 percent offered telehealth services. Awardees also developed or enhanced 111 courses, which were offered to 957 trainees. 141 Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Loan Repayment Program (STAR LRP) : In FY 2023, the Budget includes $28.0 million for STAR LRP, which is $12.0 million above the FY 2022 CR level. The STAR LRP recruits and retains medical, nursing, behavioral/mental health clinicians and paraprofessionals who provide direct treatment or recovery support of patients with or in recovery from a substance use disorder. STAR LRP participants must provide services in either a county (or a municipality, if not contained within any county) where the mean drug overdose death rate per 100,000 people over the past three years exceeds the national average, or in a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designated for Mental Health. In FY 2023, STAR LRP partic ipants will be fulfilling part of their required SUD treatment service commitments, and HRSA anticipates making 112 awards with approximately $28.0 million in funding. This funding is included in the BHWET funding line. The Graduate Psychology Education (GPE) Program: The Budget includes $25.0 million for GPE, which is $6.0 million above the FY 2022 CR level. This Program supports innovative doctoral -level health psychology programs that foster an interprofessional approach to providing behavioral health and substance use prevention and treatment services in high need and high demand areas through academic and community partnerships. Through these efforts, the GPE Program transforms clinical training environments and aligns with HRSA's mission to improve health outcomes and address health disparities through access to quality services, a skilled health workforce, and innovative, high-value programs. In Academic Year 2020 -2021, the GPE Program provided stipend support to 376 students participating in practica, internships, or post -doctoral residency programs in psychology. The majority of students were trained in medically underserved communities (92 percent) and/or primary care settings (74 percent). Ninety-six percent of students received training in substance use treatment, 92 percent received training in opioid use treatment, and 67 percent received training in medication assisted treatment for substance use disorder and opioid use disorder. Additionally, 97 percent of students trained at sites off ering telehealth services, and 54 percent received training in health equity/the social determinants of health. Of the 181 students who completed GPE -supported programs during this time period, 70 percent intended to become employed or pursue further trai ning in medically underserved communities, and 46 percent intended to become employed or pursue further training in primary care settings. In addition, 50 percent of last year's graduates who provided one -year follow -up data were currently employed in or pursuing further training in medically underserved communities; 29 percent were employed at Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, or FQHCs or Look - alikes; and 21 percent were currently providing treatment or wraparound services to individuals with substance use disorders. GPE awardees partnered with 247 sites (e.g., hospitals, ambulatory practice sites, and academic institutions) to provide 732 clinical training experiences for psychology graduate students, who trained alongside 3,937 interprofessional team -based care train ees. Approximately 87 percent of the sites were located in medically underserved communities, 61 percent were in primary care settings, and 29 percent were in rural areas. In addition, 90 percent of the sites offered telehealth services, 76 percent offer ed substance use treatment services, and 72 percent offered integrated behavioral health services in primary care settings. 142 In fall 2020, HRSA conducted an evaluation of GPE by administering surveys to GPE awardees, trainees, and partner sites. Evaluato rs found that most (88 percent) GPE grant programs involved experiential sites in designing their curriculum and training program, indicating that the GPE program supported academic and community partnerships. These experiential training sites involved tr ainees in different care team functions, such as screening and assessments (95 percent), referrals to other services (95 percent), care coordination (90 percent), and treatment plan development (83 percent). Nearly half of GPE awardees (47 percent) reported that they educated the public on behavioral health and/or SUD treatment and 56 percent of GPE awardees indicated that they addressed the social determinants of health by linking patients to social services or employment. In addition, almost all trainees (91 percent) sought to work in a rural or underserved community because of the opportunity to apply a diverse skill set and 86 percent said training in an underserved area influenced their decision to work in a rural or underserved community upon completion. The future targets for the GPE Program take into account the timing of the psychology internship match and GPE funding. Because the annual psychology match for the next academic year occurs in early spring and grant funds are allocated in September, GPE grantees would have already had interns match prior to funding; therefore, almost a one -year delay occurs between the start of the next academic year and this Program's funding cycle.

Formula Grant/Competitive Grant Program Description and Accomplishments: The Advanced Nursing Education Programs increase the number of qualified nurses in the primary care workforce by improvin g advanced nursing education through traineeships as well as curriculum and faculty development. The programs include a preference for supporting rural and underserved communities. Advanced Nursing Education Workforce (ANEW) Program: In FY 2019, HRSA e stablished the ANEW Program to train advanced practice registered nursing (APRN) students to provide primary care in rural and underserved communities. The program aims to do so by supporting innovative academic -practice partnerships that prepare primary care APRNs for the unique challenges of practicing in rural and underserved communities, thereby increasing access to needed primary care for these populations. The partnerships support traineeships as well as academic-practice program infrastructure for schools of nursing and their practice partners to deliver longitudinal primary care clinical training experiences with rural and/or underserved populations. The partnerships also help link program graduates to the HRSA Health Workforce Connector, which he lps connect eligible professionals to communities in need, and other existing support resources so they can find employment in rural and underserved community-based settings. The program goal is to increase the number of primary care Nurse Practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and Nurse Midwives serving rural and underserved populations, thereby improving access to care and increasing the distribution of health care providers. In Academic Year 2020 -2021, awardees of the ANEW Program trained 4,379 nurs ing students, more than one third of whom were underrepresented minorities and/or from disadvantaged backgrounds (38 percent). The ANEW program produced 1,644 graduates who were ready to enter the health care workforce. Of the 1,627 students who were dir ectly funded by ANEW, the majority trained in primary care settings (77 percent), in medically underserved communities (75 72 Includes funding for the Advanced Nursing Education and Nurse Optional Fellowship Program. 155 percent), and/or in a setting that offered telehealth (62 percent). Forty-eight percent of students received training in opioid use treatment. More than 65 percent of students who were directly funded received COVID -19 related training and 37 percent received health equity training. For individuals for whom one -year post graduation data was available, over half were pursuing additional training in a medically underserved community (53 percent). In addition, 51 percent of the recently graduated individuals were working in a primary care setting. To provide clinical training experiences to nursing students, awardees partnered with 2, 049 clinical training sites in primary care settings (75 percent), medically underserved communities (65 percent), and/or rural areas (33 percent). More than half of the partner sites provided services to individuals with mental health or substance use disorders (51 percent) and uninsured or underinsured individuals and families (52 percent); 21 percent offered services to undocumented immigrants. ANEW awardees developed or enhanced 520 courses for trainees, provided 135 continuing education courses to practicing professionals, and offered 167 faculty and preceptor development programs. Advanced Nursing Education -Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (ANE -SANE) Program : Established in 2018, the Advanced Nursing Education - Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (ANE - SAN E) program increases the number of RNs, APRNs and forensic nurses trained and certified as sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs) in communities on a local, regional and/or state level. The purpose of the ANE -SANE program is to fund advanced nursing educa tion to recruit, train and certify nurses to practice as sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs). The program aims to increase the supply and distribution of qualified working SANEs and expand access to sexual assault forensic examinations. By expanding a ccess to SANEs, the ANE -SANE program aims to provide better physical and mental health care treatment for survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence leading to better evidence collection and potentially higher prosecution rates. Programs are requir ed to form collaborative linkages (partnerships) to support training, participant recruitment, training access, practice experience opportunities, practice retention efforts, and to cultivate environments conducive to SANE training and practice throughout the period of performance. In Academic Year 2020 -2021, awardees from the ANE -SANE Program trained 2,360 students and produced 858 graduates. The majority of trainees were from a rural and/or disadvantaged background (57 percent). More than half of SANE trainees received their training in medically underserved communities (53 percent) and about one in ten received training in rural areas (13 percent). Twenty -one percent of students participated in health equity training and approximately 19 percent parti cipated in COVID -19-related training. The ANE -SANE awardees partnered with 169 clinical training sites in medically underserved communities (81 percent), rural areas (28 percent), and/or primary care settings (21 percent). More than 90 percent of the sites provided services to victims of interpersonal violence, abuse, or trauma. SANE awardees developed and/or enhanced 109 courses, 28 percent of which were focused on evidence -based practice. In FY 2023, HRSA plans to continue supporting the training of SANEs through partnerships that promote recruitment of trainees, interagency collaboration, and integration of trauma -informed, evidence -based sexual assault and domestic violence services into training and practice settings. The program will continue its focus on promoting and increasing partnerships with HRSA -156 supported health centers, other HRSA -funded sites, and critical shortage facilities; and supporting technical assistance to improve processes and address system -level and structural barriers to SANE t raining and practice. HRSA made 20 new awards in FY 2021. HRSA anticipates $9.0 million in 20 continuation awards for the ANE -SANE Program in FY 2023. Nurse Anesthetist Traineeships (NAT) Program: In existence for over two decades, the purpose of the NA T Program is to increase the number of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists providing care, especially to rural and underserved populations. NAT program aims to achieve this by providing support to full -time nurse anesthetist trainees, through educational institutions. The funds for the NAT Program are distributed among all eligible applicant institutions based on a formula. Accredited institutions that educate Registered Nurses to become Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists will disburse funds to Student Registered Nurse Anesthetists in the form of traineeship support. Student Registered Nurse Anesthetists may use traineeship funds during the period for which the traineeship is provided for full or partial costs of the tuition and fees, any requir ed books/e -books and reasonable living expenses (stipends). The program supports eligible entities to meet the cost of traineeships for individuals (full -time only) in nurse anesthesia degree programs, lessening the financial barrier to program completion and increasing the number of certified registered nurse anesthetists providing care, especially to rural and underserved populations. The NAT Program intent is to increase the number of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists nationally who are well prep ared and well positioned to practice independently and deliver evidence -based, high quality, and safe anesthesia and services related to the management and treatment of acute and chronic pain. In Academic Year 2020 -2021, awardees of the NAT Program provided direct financial support to 1,757 nurse anesthetist students. Students received clinical training in medically underserved communities (81 percent), rural areas (33 percent), and/or primary care settings (23 percent). In addition, NAT trainees partici pated in opioid use treatment (81 percent), COVID -19 related training (73 percent), and/or substance use treatment (65 percent). In total, 1,323 students graduated from their degree programs and entered the workforce. At the time of graduation, 52 percen t of graduates intended to pursue employment or further training in medically underserved communities, 18 percent planned to pursue employment or further training in a primary care setting, and 14 percent planned to pursue employment or further training in a rural area. Of prior year graduates for whom one year follow -up data was available, 49 percent were employed in a medically underserved and/or rural community. Advanced Nursing Education Nurse Practitioner Residency and Fellowship (ANE -NPRF) Program : In FY 2023, HRSA intends to combine the current Advanced Nursing Education Nurse Practitioner Residency Program (ANE -NPR) and Advanced Nursing Education Nurse Practitioner Residency Integration Program (ANE -NPRIP) into one program called the Advanced Nursi ng Education Nurse Practitioner Residency and Fellowship (ANE -NPRF) Program. In some instances, the same entity is a recipient of funding from both programs. Combining ANE -NPR and ANE -NPRIP into the new ANE -NPRF Program is intended to improve program eff iciency while reducing burden for award recipients managing awards in both programs. The ANE -NPRF Program will prepare new primary care and behavioral health nurse practitioners and maternal health providers, to work in community-based settings with an 157 integration of behavioral health. The program seeks to increase the number of new primary care Nurse Practitioners (adult, family, adult gerontology, pediatric and women's health), behavioral health Nurse Practitioners (psychiatric/mental health) and certi fied nurse midwives serving in behavioral health integrated community-based settings; and by supporting the expansion and/or enhancement of existing Nurse Practitioners residency programs. The program will fund accredited Nurse Practitioner Residency programs as well as programs in the accreditation process for practicing postgraduate Nurse Practitioners (Residents or Fellows) in primary care or behavioral health. This proposed new ANE -NPRF program will require merging the Nurse Practitioner Optional Fell owship Program funding line into the Advanced Nursing Education funding line, and combining the funding reserved for ANE -NPR under the ANE funding line with the funding appropriated for ANE -NPRIP (or NPOFP). In Academic Year (AY) 2020 -2021, the ANE -NPR P rogram trained 319 nurse practitioner (NP) residents and graduated 171 NP residents . Almost all of the NP residents received training in medically underserved communities (99 percent) and/or a primary care setting (99 percent). Moreover, the majority of the NP residents participated in trainings related to COVID -19 (96 percent), opioid use treatment (90 percent), and/or trained in a setting that offered telehealth (90 percent).Sixty-six percent of AY 2020-2021 graduates were employed in a primary care setti ng, 63 percent were employed in a medically underserved community, and 26 percent were employed in a rural area. Of prior year graduates, 77 percent were working in primary care settings one year after graduation, 77 percent were working in medically under served communities, and 31 percent were working in a rural area. Fifty -two percent of AY 2020-2021 graduates and 77 percent of prior year graduates were employed in FQHCs or look-alikes and Rural Health Clinics. The ANE -NPRIP Program trained 49 NP residents during AY 2020-2021, 22 percent of whom were from underrepresented minority and/or disadvantaged backgrounds. One hundred percent of the NP residents received training in primary care settings and medically underserved communities, and 43 percent receive d training in rural settings. Moreover, all NP residents participated in trainings related to COVID -19 (100 percent), health equity (100 percent), and integrated behavioral health in primary care (100 percent) and trained in a setting that offers telehealt h (100 percent). Eighty-eight percent of residents received training in medication assisted treatment (MAT) for substance use disorder/opioid use disorder, leading to 55 percent of residents receiving a waiver from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Ser vices Administration to prescribe MAT. Nursing Workforce Advancing Health Equity (NWAHE) Technical Assistance Ce nter Program: In FY 2023, HRSA will establish the Nursing Health Workforce Advancing Health Equity (NWAHE) Technical Assistance (TA) Center. The purpose of the NWAHE program is to advance health equity, including the well -being of patients and communities, by providing training and TA to academic institutions that educate, and health care organizations that employ advanced nurses. This program will develop and provide tailored technical assistance (TA) to institutions to train, adopt and support practices that assist advanced nurses to address health equity in practice. 158 Growing and Diversifying the Nursing Workforce Program: HRSA will award $25.0 million in grants, including planning grants, to grow and diversify the maternal and perinatal health nursing workforce by increasing and diversifying the number of Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs) with a focus on practitioners working in rural and underserved communities. The program will fund accredited nurse midwifery programs or other eligible entities to award scholarships to students and RNs to cover the total cost of tuition for the duration of the nurse midwifery program. And will support the planning/development of new midwife training programs. In addition, the program will also support costs for each project to administer the training. The aim is to increase and expand the supply and distribution of, and access to qualified diverse CNMs through support for new and existing nurse midwifery training programs. This will be accomplished by recruiting a diverse student pool, supporting academic - practice partnerships, providing longitudinal immersion training and creating post -employment opportunit ies. This funding will help advance equity and address dis parities in maternal mortality. Eligible Entities: Schools of nursing, nursing centers, academic health centers, State or local governments, FQHCs, and other public or private, non-profit entities determined appropriate by the Secretary.

Competitive Grant/Contract Program Description and Accomplishments: The Nursing Workforce Diversity (NWD) Program increases nursing education opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, including racial and ethnic minorities who are underrepresented among registered nurses. The overarching goal of the NWD Program is to increase access to high quality, culturally aligned registered nurse providers that reflect the diversity of the communi ties in which they serve. This goal is accomplished by assisting students from disadvantaged backgrounds to become registered nurses through student stipends, scholarships, pre -entry preparation and retention activities; facilitating diploma or associate degree registered nurses to become baccalaureate-prepared registered nurses; and preparing practicing registered nurses for advanced nursing education. The NWD Eldercare Enhancement (NWD -E2) Program strengthens the eldercare workforce communities where there are health care disparities related to access and delivery of care through the expansion of these opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. NWD -E2 aims to achieve a sustainable eldercare nursing workforce and equip the nursing student s with the competencies necessary to address health care disparities related to access and delivery of care of elderly populations in rural and underserved areas. In FY 2021, HRSA supported 32 new NWD awards, two NWD -E2 continuation awards, and three new N WD-E2 awards were fully funded. In FY 2022, HRSA will support 32 NWD continuing awards and 2 new awards. In FY 2023, HRSA will support approximately 3 new NWD awards and 34 continuing NWD awards.

FY 2023 Authorization ........................................................................................... $117,135,000 Allocation Method ............................................................................................... Formula Grant Program De scription and Accomplishments: The purpose of the Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP), which began in 2003, is to increase the number of qualified nurse faculty nationwide. The NFLP provides funding to accredited schools of nursing to establish and operate a student loan fund and provide loans to students enrolled in advanced education nursing degree programs who are committed to becoming nurse faculty. In exchange for completion of up to four years of post -graduation full -time nurse faculty employment in an accredited school of nursing, the program authorizes cancelation of up to 85 percent of any such student loan (plus interest thereon). The NFLP addresses the national nursing faculty and preceptor shortage by supporting institutions committed to preparing advanced degree nursing students to serve as nurse faculty and preceptors. In Academic Year (AY) 2020 -2021, awardees supported 2,763 nursing students pursuing graduate level degrees with the intent of serving as nurse faculty. Twenty-four percent of trainees were underrepresented minorities and 24 percent came from disadvantaged backgrounds. By the end of the Academic Year, the programs graduated 779 trainees, 92 percent of whom intended to teach nursing. One year after graduation, seventy-four percent of prior year graduates were teaching in faculty appointments. The NFLP program provided loans to 2,763 graduate -level nursing students, exceeding the FY 2020 target for 6.I.C.46 (1,900 loans). This increase occurred because the NLFP program updated the definition of \"full -time employment,\" expanding loan cancelati on eligibility to include nurse faculty serving as advanced practice registered nurse preceptors for accredited schools of nursing (within an academic -practice partnership framework). Program staff also increased resource sharing, outreach, and technic al assistance to NFLP awardees. BHW conducted a five -year outcome evaluation of the NFLP program using data from AY 2015-2016 to AY 2019-2020. During this time frame, BHW funded 203 unique awardees that conducted active NFLP programs. NFLP awardees provided $147 million in loan repayment funding to between 1,998 and 2,328 nursing students each year pursuing graduate level degrees with the intent of serving as nurse faculty. Over 50 percent of NFLP nursing graduate students focused on education and almost 20 percent focused on research. Throughout the five year 171 period, 48 percent of NFLP graduates received Doctorate of Nurse Practitioner degrees and another 26 percent received other types of doctoral degrees. Upon program completion, 91 percent of NFLP graduates intended to teach nursing with 1,969 reporting that they already secured employment as nurse faculty. Within one year of completing NFLP, 81 percent of prior year graduates were teaching in faculty appointments, with 43 percent teaching at the under graduate level. The number of schools receiving a new NFLP award does not equate to the number of schools providing NFLP loans to graduate -level nursing students. New NFLP awards are made to eligible new applicants (with no current NFLP award) and continuing applicants (with a current NFLP award), who apply for the funding annually. In order to receive a new NFLP award, continuing applicants must meet certain criteria with regard to program compliance and loan fund balances. However, even schools that do not receive new awards may continue making loans from the student loan fund accounts they have already established. NFLP grantees are expected to continue conducting training activity and maintaining the loan fund account throughout the duration of the project. Currently, NFLP has a total 205 awardees maintaining the loan fund account. In FY 2023, HRSA plans to make 80 new awards to new and continuing NFLP applicants. Eligible Entity: Accredited schools of nursing that offer advanced nursing education degree program(s) that prepare graduate students for roles as nurse educators. Designated Health Professions Targeted Educational Levels Grantee Activities Nursing Graduate (masters, post - masters and doctoral) Use the federal contribution to establish and/or maintain a student loan fund.

Other (Competitive Awards to Individuals) Program Description and Accomplishments: The Nurse Corps Program addresses: (1) the distribution of nurses by supporting nurses and nursing students committed to working in communities with inadequate access to care; (2) access to behavioral health services by increasing funding for scholarships and loan repayment assistance for behavioral health training and servic e for Nurse Practitioners (NPs) specializing in psychiatric mental health; and (3) access to women's and maternal health services by increasing funding for scholarships and loan repayment assistance to scholars pursuing degrees and clinicians serving in th is specialty area. In exchange for scholarship support or educational loan repayment, Nurse Corps members fulfill their service obligation by working in Critical Shortage Facilities (CSFs) located in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) and underserved communities throughout the nation, which include rural communities and other identified geographic areas, populations, or facilities that lack access to primary care, dental health, or behavioral health services. As of September 30, 2021, over three -quarters of the Nurse Corps providers were serving in community-based settings and 21 percent were serving in rural communities. Nurse Corps Loan Repayment Program (LRP): The Nurse Corps LRP began in 1998 to assist in the recruitment and retention of professional RNs, including advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), (i.e., nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, clinical nurse specialists) who are dedicated to working in CSFs or as faculty in eligible scho ols of nursing. The Nurse Corps LRP decreases the economic barriers associated with pursuing careers in CSFs or in academic nursing by repaying 60 percent of the principal and interest on nursing education loans in exchange for two years of full -time serv ice at a CSF or in academic nursing. Nurse Corps Scholarship Program (SP) : The Nurse Corps SP began in 2002 to provide scholarships to individuals who are enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an accredited school of nursing in exchange for a service comm itment of at least two years in a CSF after graduation. 174 Nurse Corps SP awards reduce the financial barrier to nursing education for all levels of professional nursing students and increase the pipeline of nurses who will serve in CSFs. The Nurse Corps per formance measures gauge the program's contribution towards improving access to health care and improving the health care systems through the recruitment and retention of nurses working in CSFs. In FY 2021, 58 percent of Nurse Corps LRP participants extended their service commitment for an additional year, exceeding the 52 percent target; and in FY 2021, 84 percent of Nurse Corps participants were retained in service at a CSF for up to two years beyond the completion of their Nurse Corps service commitment. 79 In addition, in FY 2021, 89 percent of Nurse Corps SP awardees are pursuing their baccalaureate degree or advanced practice degree. Furthermore, as the Administration seeks to continue to address the opioid epidemic and other substance use disorders across the nation, the Nurse Corps program provides support behavioral health nursing workforce. In FY 2022, HRSA plans to continue directing up to 20 percent of scholarship and loan repayment awards to NPs specializing in psychiatric -mental health with the goal of leveraging HRSA funding to address the opioid crisis and the recent impacts COVID -19 has had on the nation's mental health. The COVID -19 pandemic has added a new layer of challenges to the preservation and expansion of the nursing workforce. Stress and burnout in the nursing workforce are among the most pressing concerns. The risks of acquiring COVID -19, and concerns about transmitting the virus to family and loved ones can all contribute to burnout and an interest in changing to other careers. 80 Nurses have reported experiencing stress associated with separation from family, sleep deprivation, and heavy workloads created by health system demand and staff shortages.81 Nurses serving throughout the country, especially those on the front lines battli ng this pandemic, are seeing an increased demand for their services. The Nurse Corps will initiate collaborative technical assistance efforts to share resources and best practices to reduce stress and provider burnout. Additionally, the Nurse Corps suppor ts increasing the skilled workforce of women's health nurses who are trained to provide care for women, and practice in rural and underserved communities. Maternal mortality and morbidity are key indicators of women's health worldwide. Each year more tha n 300,000 women across the globe die from complications associated with pregnancy or childbirth. 82 In 2015, the U.S. ranked 46th among the 181 countries 79 In FY 2020, HRSA began using the \"Clinician Dashboard\" to calculate the retention rate. The Clinician Dashboard is a data visu alization tool that includes data on clinicians with NPI numbers supported by the National Health Service Corps and Nurse Corps. 80 Fernandez PR, Lord H, Halcomb PE, et al.

In FY 2022, HRSA plans to continue funding for women's and maternal health services up to $5 million each for scholarship and loan repayment awards for the funding of women's health NPs, certified nurse m idwifery (CNM), and certified obstetrics and gynecology RNs. In FY 2021, the Nurse Corps Program received a historic amount of funding through the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act, which provided the program with $200 million in additional funding to support the nation's COVID -19 emergency response. The Nurse Corps Program plans to fully expend these funds in FY 2022. In FY 2021, the Nurse Corps made 782 awards to clinicians serving in facilities with a shortage of nurses and 325 awards to scholars pursuing a nursing education. In FY 2022, the Nurse Corps estimates making 1,030 additional awards to clinicians serving in facilities with a shortage of nurses and 300 awards to scholars pursuing a nursing education. Approximately $6 million in ARP Act funds ar e being used to support nurse faculty members who will train the next generation of nurses. These funds are focused on priority areas including behavioral health, women's health, and community health. The additional awards made with ARP Act funds will inc rease the number of continuation awards anticipated to be made in FY 2023 and FY 2024. Eligible Entities: For the Nurse Corps LRP, participants must have a current license to practice as an RN who are employed full -time (at least 32 hours per week) at a public or private CSF or at an accredited public or private school of nursing.

The Dr. Benjy Frances Brooks Children's Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-241) reauthorized the program through fiscal year 2023. FY 2023 Authorization.. Direct GME: $105,000,000; Indirect Medical Education: $220,000,000 Allocation Method .................................................................................Formula Based Payment Program Description and Accomplishments: The Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) Payment Program was firs t established in 1999 and it supports graduate medical education in freestanding children's teaching hospitals. CHGME Payment Program helps eligible hospitals maintain GME programs to support graduate training for physicians to provide quality care to children. It supports the training of residents to care for the pediatric population and enhances the supply of primary care and pediatric medical and surgical subspecialties. A sufficient and appropriate health workforce, efficient organization of health care teams, and training in value -based models of care are all critical components to supporting new models of care that drive value and quality throughout the entire system. In FY 2022, the CHGME Payment Program is implementing the fourth year of the Qua lity Bonus System (QBS), authorized by statute to allow the Secretary of HHS to distribute bonus payments to participating CHGME hospitals that meet quality standards specified by the Secretary. The goal of the QBS is to recognize and incentivize awardees with high quality training to meet the pediatric workforce needs of the nation. In FY 2022, CHGME includes up to an estimated $3 million available for the CHGME QBS. In order to qualify for the QBS payment, awardees must complete individual level docum entation for all residents supported by the CHGME Payment Program in the FY 2022 Annual Performance Report (AY 2021-2022). The CHGME Payment Program supports the training of residents in graduate medical education in freestanding children's teaching hospitals and supports a Full -Time Equivalent (FTE) Assessment conducted annually to verify the number of FTE resident counts reported by eligible awardees. In FY 2021, the CHGME Payment Program distributed more than $330 million to 59 eligible awardees, incl uding nearly $1.8 million in QBS payments to 32 awardees who met the eligibility requirements. For FY 2022, the CHGME Payment Program will award more than $330 million from the base to the same 59 eligible awardees including a QBS payment for those 179 who meet the QBS eligibility criteria. For FY 2023, the CHGME Payment Program plans on the same level funding as the prior fiscal year and number of eligible awardees. The CHGME Payment Program has an annual project period from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023. In FY 2021, 59 children's hospitals received CHGME funding. During FY 2021 (AY 2020-2021), the most recent year for which FTE information was reported, the CHGME hospitals trained 7,900 resident full -time equivalents (FTEs). 92 Among these FTEs, 42 percent were pediatric residents, 29 percent were pediatric subspecialty residents, and 29 percent were residents training in other primary disciplines such as family medicine. During Academic Year 2020-2021, the most recent year for which performance information is available, CHGME -funded hospitals served as sponsoring institutions for 42 residency programs and 246 fellowship programs. In addition, they served as major participating rotation sites for 642 additional residency and fellowship programs. CHGME supported the training of 5,628 pediatric residents that included general pediatrics residents, as well as residents from eight types of combined pediatrics programs (e.g., internal medicine/ pediatrics). Additionally, 2,904 pediatric medical subspecialty residents, 238 pediatric surgical subspecialty residents, and 430 adult and pediatric dentistry residents were trained. CHGME funding was also responsible for the training of 4,572 adult medical and surgical specialty residents, such as family me dicine residents, who rotate through children's hospitals for pediatrics training. The total number of funded residents and fellows during Academic Year 2020-2021 was 13,772. During their training, these medical residents and fellows provided care during more than 1.4 million patient encounters in primary care settings, in addition to providing over 5.5 million patient contact hours in medically underserved communities. Of the full -time residents and fellows who completed their training during Academic Year 2020- 2021, over 61 percent of these CHGME -funded physicians chose to remain and practice in the state where they completed their residency training. Among the 330 health care delivery sites utilized for residency training, 46 percent provided telehea lth services, 22 percent offered substance use treatment services, and 27 percent offered COVID -19 related services. Approximately 21 percent of residents received training in opioid use treatment, 20 percent received training in telehealth, and 65 percent received COVID -19 related training.

Submit an annual report on the status and expansion of GME in their ins titutions. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount $350,000,000 Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the CHGME Program of $350.0 million is equal to the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level . This request will fund the current number of eligible children's hospitals of approximately 59 awards. The Budget request enables HRSA to continue to support approximately 7,700 physici ans FTEs for direct and indirect medical expenses for graduate medical education. Direct medical education spending includes expenditures related to stipends and fringe benefits for residents, salaries and fringe benefits of supervising faculty, costs associated with providing the GME training programs and institutional overhead costs. Indirect medical education spending includes expenditures associated with the productivity of the hospital staff as they assist in training residents, and the processing of additional diagnostic tests that residents may order during their clinical experience. The FY 2023 funding request will support the FTE resident verification through an annual FTE Assessment contract to ensure funded FTEs counts are reported correctly a nd are not funded by other federal programs to avoid an overlap in payments. The funding will also support costs associated with the award process, program performance reviews, QBS eligibility reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. The funding will further support additional information technology enhancements that ensure accurate certification of FTE counts and analysis of QBS data needed to determine payments. 181 The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

Formula -Based Payment Program Description and Accomplishments: As of August 6, 2021, an estimated 81 million people live in primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs), 61 million live in dental HPSAs, and 122 million live in mental health HPSAs. 94 Access to high quality primary care is associated with improved health outcomes and lower costs.95, 96 A number of strategies are effective in incentivizing providers to choose careers in primary care and to practice in rural and underserved areas, including positive training experiences in rural and underserved communities and rotations in community-based practice locations. 97,98 There is evidence that physicians who re ceive training in community and underserved settings are more likely to eventually practice in similar settings, such as health centers.99 The Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) Program, established in 2010, increases the number of primary care physician and dental residents, which, in turn, increases the overall number of these primary care providers. Teaching Health Centers (THCs) specifically have been shown to attract residents from rural and/or disadvantaged 94 Health Services and Resources Administration. (2021).

After residency training, evidence demonstrates that physicians who trained in cost -efficient geographic areas continue to provide lower -cost care in their post -residency practice.102 In addition to increasing the number of primary care residents training in these community-based patient care settings, the THCGME Program meets the Administration's pri ority by increasing health care quality and expanding Americans' overall access to care. Program funds support the educational costs incurred by new and expanded residency programs. Along with supporting the salaries and benefits of residents and faculty, THCGME funds are used to foster innovation and support curriculum concepts aimed at improving the quality of patient care, such as the Patient -Centered Medical Home model, Electronic Health Record utilization, population health, telemedicine, and health c are leadership. These activities ensure residents receive high quality training and are well prepared to practice in community-based settings after graduation. In Academic Year 2021 -2022, HRSA provided awards to 59 THCs that are supporting the training of 793 resident FTEs. Currently, 45 of the 59 THCs are in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) or FQHC Look -Alikes. In Academic Years 2022 -2023, HRSA anticipates awarding approximately $220 million appropriated by the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 to support more than 100 THCs. These funds will be used to increase the maximum number of approved resident FTE slots to over 1,375. In addition, funds will be used to increase the PRA payment to THCGME awardees by $10,000, resulting in a total payment of $160,000 per resident FTE starting in FY 2021. In Fiscal Year 2022, 47 planning and development awards were made from the ARP Act to support the start-up of new community-based, primary care residency programs in family medicine, internal medic ine, pediatrics, psychiatry, obstetrics and gynecology, general dentistry and pediatric dentistry to address the physician workforce shortages and challenges faced by rural and underserved communities. 100 Talib, Z, Jewers, MM, Strasser, JH, Popiel, DK, Goldberg, DG, Chen, C, Kepley, H, Mullan, Regenstein, M.

Information and data from this evaluation will be available in FY 2023 and will provide HRSA with information to help determine the appropriate per resident payment (PRA) amount for THCGME residency programs in subsequent years. In Academic Year 2020 -2021, the THCGME Program awarded 769103 resident FTE slots that provided funding to 912 primary care medical and dental residents. Nearly all residents (98 percent) received training in a primary care setting, providing care during almost half a million patient encounters and accruing over 620,000 contact hours with these primary care patients. Additionally, most THCGME residents (93 percent) spent a significant part of their training in medically underserved and/or rural communities, providing more than 1.1 million hours of patient care to more than 850,000 patients. Approximately 19 percent of residents reported coming from a financially or educationally disadvantaged background, 20 percent reported being an underrepresented minority, and 20 percent reported a rural background. During their residency, approximately 82 percent of residents received training in opioid use treatment, 82 percent received training in telehealth, and 67 percent received COVID -19 related training. In addition to supporting training of individual residents in Academic Year 20-21, THCGME recipients also used funding to develop or enhance curricula on topics related to primary care. Programs developed or enhanced and implemented 1,547 courses and tra ining activities during the academic year, impacting almost 15,000 health care trainees. Over 6,400 students, residents, and other health care professionals from a variety of professions and disciplines trained alongside THCGME residents while participating in inter -professional team -based care. Among the 562 health care delivery sites utilized for residency training, 51 percent provided telehealth services, 35 percent offered COVID -19 related services, and 33 percent offered substance use treatment servi ces. Of the 297 residents who completed the program in Academic Year 2020-2021, 63 percent reported intentions to practice in a primary care setting, while 43 percent intended to practice in a medically underserved and/or rural area. Employment status wi ll be assessed for these individuals one year after program completion (during Academic Year 2021-2022). Of the 228 program completers from the prior academic year for whom employment data was available, 64 percent currently practice in a primary care set ting and 56 percent currently practice in a medically underserved community and/or rural area. Since the THCGME Program began, 1,731 new primary care physicians and dentists have graduated and entered the workforce. As the national average of physicians practicing in primary care specialties is approximately 33 percent, 104 the THCGME Program has evidenced much stronger results. Cumulative follow -up data indicates that 65 percent of graduates are currently practicing in a primary setting and approximately 56 percent of the graduating 103 Awarded FTE slots are not the maximum res ident FTE cap of up to 801 resident FTEs. 104 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

FY 2023 Authorization ................................................................................................. Indefinite Allocation Method .......................................................................................... User Fee Program Program Description and Accomplishments: The National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) is a workforce tool that improves health care quality, promotes patient safety, and deters fraud and abuse in the health care system by providing information about past adverse actions of practitioners, providers, and suppliers to authorized health care entities and agencies. With more than 1.6 million reports since its inception in 1990, the NPDB helps reduce health care fraud and abuse by collect ing and disclosing information to authorized entities on health care -related civil judgments and criminal convictions, adverse licensure and certification actions, exclusions from health care programs, and other adjudicated actions taken against health car e providers, suppliers, and practitioners. Authorized health care entities then use this information to make informed hiring, credentialing, and privileging decisions to ultimately determine whether, or under what conditions, it is appropriate for health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers to provide health care services. Prior to NPDB's inception, health care providers who lost their licenses or had serious unprofessional conduct could move from state to state with impunity, making it difficul t for employers and licensing boards to learn about their prior acts. Through the use of the NPDB, employers and other authorized health care entities are able to receive reliable information on health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers. In FY 2021, the NPDB responded to nearly 10.4 million queries, nearly half a million more queries than in FY 2020, from authorized health care entities, practitioners, providers, and suppliers. DPDB has completed the launch of attestation initiatives for HRSA's community health centers, hospitals, health plans, medical malpractice payers, all other health care entities, and authorized agents. To date, the attestation completion rate for selected health centers, 189 hospitals, health plans, medical malpractice payers, all other health care entities, and authorized agents is over 90 percent. In FY 2020, the NPDB released a publicly available interactive Compliance Results tool111 that displays the compliance and attestation results for state licensing and certification boards. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, the NPDB temporarily waived query fees. The fee waiver supported health care entities, during this national emergency, to make informed hiring, licensing, and credentialing decisions. As a result, the NP DB waived fees for over 6 million one -time queries, continuous queries, and continuous query renewals between March 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020. In FY 2021, the NPDB improved services to health care practitioners by enabling digitally certified self -query responses and allowing report subjects the ability to access multiple reports through a single account. In an FY 2021 survey, the NPDB had an over 90% satisfaction rate among entity users and over 94% agreed that the information from the NPDB makes t heir organization confident about the decisions they make concerning practitioners. In FY 2022 and FY 2023, the NPDB intends to continue to improve both the services available to practitioners and the education materials available to entity users. Funding History The table below shows the user fees (revenue) collected (or expected to be collected): Fiscal Year Amount FY 2019 The FY 2023 Budget Request for NPDB of $18.8 million in user fees, is equal to the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. This is based on HRSA's projections of queries on practitioners and organizations. 111 https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/resources/npdbstats/npdbMap.jsp 112 The decline in revenue collected in FY 2020 was due to the NPDB temporarily waiving query fees between March 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020 in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. 190 As mandated by the Health Care Qua lity Improvement Act, the NPDB does not receive appropriated funds and is financed by the collection of user fees. Annual Appropriations Act language since FY 1993 requires that user fee collections cover the full cost of NPDB operations; therefore, there is no request for appropriation for operating the NPDB. User fees are established at a level to cover all program costs to allow the NPDB to meet annual and long-term program performance goals. Fees are established based on forecasts of query volume to result in adequate, but not excessive, revenues to pay all program costs to meet program performance goals.

Health Workforce Resiliency Training Program (HWRTP): In Fiscal Year 2022, HRSA awarded 34 awards in the Health and Public Safety Workforce Resiliency Training Program (HPSWRTP) which supports the planning, developing, operating, or participation of health profe ssions and nursing training activities, using evidence -based or evidence -informed strategies, to reduce and address burnout, suicide, mental health conditions, and substance use disorders and to promote resiliency among public safety officers and health ca re professionals, health care students, residents, trainees, and paraprofessionals in rural and medically underserved communities. Award recipients are using grants funds to: (1) provide short -term training to promote resiliency; (2) create and advance tr aining interventions, protocols and system -wide approaches to reduce and address burnout, suicide, mental health conditions and substance use disorders; and (3) develop innovative sustainability practices/models to promote provider resiliency and prevent or reduce he alth care professional burnout. Promoting Resilience and Mental Health Among Health Professional Workforce (PRMPW): The PRMHPW supports entities providing health care, health care providers associations, and Federally Qualified Health Centers (F QHCs), taking into consideration the needs of rural and medically underserved communities, to establish, enhance, or expand evidence -informed or evidenced -based programs or protocols to promote resilience, mental health, and wellness among their providers, other personnel, and members. In Fiscal Year 2022, HRSA funded 10 awards with American Rescue Plan Act resources. In FY 2023, HRSA anticipates a new competition and making 43 awards totaling approximately $48 million.

The cross -cutting measures focus specifically on the diversity of individuals completing specific types of health professions training programs;113 the rate in which individuals participating in specific types of health professions training programs are trained in medically underserved communities;114 the rate in which individuals who complete specific types of health professions training programs report being employed in a medically underserved community; and the rate in which clinical training sites provide interprofessional team -based care to patients. These measures do not currently include data from the Faculty Loan Repayment Program or the National Practitioner Data Bank.115 During Academic Year 2020-2021, results showed that 51 percent of graduates and program completers participating in BHW -supported health professions training and loan programs were underrepresented minorities (URMs) in the health professions and/or from disadvantaged backgrounds. 116 This exceeded the target of 46 percent, which was based on prior performance and reflects BHW's emphasis on diversity and health equity. 113 BHW currently funds more than 40 health professions training and loan programs that have varying types of data reporting requirements based on the program's authorizing legislation. For the purposes of the cross -cutting measures, only programs that are required to report individual -level data are included in the calculation, as this ensures a higher level of accuracy and data quality, as well as consistency in the types of programs that are included in the calculation. Currently, 37 of the BHW -funded programs are required to report individual -level data and are included in these calculations. These programs are representative of the health professions and include oral hea lth programs, behavioral health programs, medicine programs, nursing programs, geriatrics programs, and physician assistant programs, among others. 114 A medically underserved community is a geographic location or population of individuals that is eligible f or designation by a state and/or the federal government as a medically underserved area, a health professions shortage area, and/or medically underserved population. 115 Nearly all grant programs are reporting performance data that is utilized in the cross -cutting measures. Only two programs do not report data as they have specific reporting requirements unique to their legislation. 116 This measure includes individuals who graduated from or completed a specific type of HRSA -supported health professions training or loan program and identified as Hispanic (all races); Non -Hispanic Black or African American; Non -Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native; Non -Hispanic Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; and/or identified as coming from a financially and/or e ducationally disadvantaged background (regardless of race). 195 Outcomes and Outputs Table Me asure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result)117 FY Percentage of graduates and program completers of Bureau of Health Workforce - supported health professions training programs who are underrepresented minorities and/or from disadvantaged backgrounds.

The activities authorized as part of the MCH Block Grant program include: The State MCH Block Grant program , which awards formula grants to 59 states and jurisdictions to address the health needs of mothers, infants, and children, as well as children with special health care needs in their state or jurisdiction; Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) that address national or regional needs, priorit ies, or emerging issues (such as opioids, maternal mortality, and COVID -19) and demonstrate methods for improving care and outcomes for mothers and children; and Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS) grants, which help increase local service deliver y capacity and form state and local comprehensive care systems for mothers and children, including children with special health care needs. The MCH Block Grant program funding, combined with state investments, provides a significant funding source to improve access to and the quality of health services for mothers, children, and their families in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions. As defined in the Title V legislation, the purpose of the MCH Block Grant program is to enable ea ch state to: 198 Assure access to quality maternal and child health care services for mothers and children, especially for those with low incomes or limited availability of care; Reduce infant mortality and incidence of preventable diseases, and generally pr omote the health of children; Provide access to prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care to women (especially low -income and at -risk pregnant women); Increase the number of low -income children who receive regular health assessments and follow -up diagnostic and treatment services; Provide access to preventive and primary care services for low -income children as well as rehabilitative services for children with special health needs; Implement family -centered, community-based systems of coordinated care for children with special health care needs ; and Provide toll -free hotlines and other appropriate methods for pregnant women and parents to access information about services under the MCH Block Grant Program and Title XIX (Medicaid). State MCH Block Grant Pr ogram The State MCH Block Grant program awards formula grants to improve care and outcomes for mothers, children, and families in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions. A federal -state partnership, the State MCH Block Grant progra m gives states flexibilit y in meeting the unique health needs of their children and families, while HRSA assures accountability and impact through performance measurement and technical assistance. HRSA distributes funding based on a legislative funding f ormula tied to a state's level of child poverty compared to the overall level of child poverty in the United States. States report progress annually on key MCH performance/outcome measures and indicators. To assist states in improving their performance, H RSA provides technical assistance to states on request, as specified in Section 509(a)(4) of the Social Security Act. Each state conducts a comprehensive Needs Assessment, as mandated by law, every five years. This assessment helps each state to determine its highest MCH priorities, target funds to address them, and report annually on its progress. Federal funds, combined with statutorily required state matching investments, support activities that address individual state MCH needs . The State MCH Block Gr ant program continues to play an important role as a payer of last resort to address gaps in coverage and services not reimbursed by Medicaid/CHIP and other third-party payers. In addition to gap-filling direct and enabling services, state MCH programs promote the access and quality of comprehensive public health services and systems of care, including through quality improvement initiatives, workforce training, program outreach, and population-based disease prevention and health promotion campaigns. Consis tent with the block grant structure and driven by a commitment to improving the health and well -being of the nation's mothers, infants, children and families, HRSA continues to implement efforts to: 199 Reduce state burden by streamlining the narrative reporting structure of the Five -Year Needs Assessment and Application/Annual Report, reducing duplication in narrative reporting across multiple sections of the Application/Annual Report, and pre -populating performance and outcome measure data, as available, us ing national data sources. Maintain state flexibility through a comprehensive needs assessment process where state needs and priorities drive the state's selection of national performance measures and state-specific performance measures and inform the dev elopment of a state action plan that responds to individual state MCH needs. The action plan includes evidence - based/informed strategy measures that assess the outputs of state Title V strategies and activities that drive improvement in performance measure s. Improve accountability through a performance measurement framework that enables the states to describe their program efforts and demonstrate the impact of Title V on the health of mothers, children, and families, at both state and national levels. HRSA works in partnership with the State MCH Block Grant programs to provide technical assistance, as requested by the state, for addressing their MCH priority needs as well as other performance and programmatic requirements of the MCH Block Grant program. H RSA makes key state -reported financial, program, performance, and health indicator data available to the public through the Title V Information System . 121 As a longstanding source of funding for MCH populations, the State MCH Block Grant supports a wide range of services for millions of women and children, including low -income children and children with special health care needs. Program achievements include: An estimated 60 million pregnant women, infants, and children, including children with special health care needs, benefitted from a service supported by the State MCH Block Grant program in FY 2020. Nationwide, the 59 State MCH Block Grant programs reached approximately 93 percent of pregnant women, 98 perc ent of infants, and 60 percent of children. Access to health services for mothers has improved with the support of the State MCH Block Grant program. The percentage of women who received early prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy increased fr om 71.0 percent in 2007 to 77.7 percent in 2020. Recognizing that improving maternal and child health in the United States will require improving women's health before pregnancy, 47 states and jurisdictions are now working to improve access to preventive and primary care for all women of childbearing age. The infant mortality rate is a widely used indicator of the nation's health. The State MCH Block Grant program has played a lead role in the 25 percent decline in U.S. infant mortality from 7.2 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1997 to 5.4 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2020. Efforts to reduce the overall infant mortality rate and its contributing factors continue. 121 Title V Information System (TVIS). https://mchb.tvisdata.hrsa.gov/ 200 States are also working to reduce maternal mortality, which has been rising over the past two decades, through a range of approaches. For example, based on reporting in the FY 2021/FY 2019 Title V Application/Annual Reports, 50 State MCH Block Grant programs provided funding to support comprehensive maternal mortality reviews to ident ify contributing factors to maternal death, monitor trends, and/or initiate appropriate action to reduce such events in the future. States also use Title V funds to more broadly address women's and maternal health to improve maternal and other pregnancy-re lated outcomes through activities such as promoting well -woman visits, increasing access to prenatal care, and enhancing systems of care around maternal mental health. Select National Outcome and National Performance Measures in effect from 1997 to 2020 illustrate the program's successes: National Outcome or Performance Measur es Percent Change (1997 - 2020 unless otherwise noted) Data Source Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births 25% decrease National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Neonatal mortalit y rate per 1,000 live births 25% decrease NVSS Postneonatal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 24% decrease NVSS Perinatal mortality rate per 1,000 live births plus fetal deaths 22% decrease (1997 -2019) NVSS Child mortality rate, ages 1 through 9 per 100,000 children 38% decrease NVSS Percent of children who have completed the combined 7 -vaccine (includes Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Polio, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Haemophilus Influenza, and Hepatitis B) series by age 24 months 3% increase (2011-2017) National Immunization Survey (NIS) Percentage of children without health insurance 64% decrease National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Percent of infants breastfed exclusively through 6 months of age 87% increase (2007 -2018) NIS Percent of infants born to pregnant women receiving prenatal care beginning in the first trimester 9% increase (2007-2020) NVSS Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) HRSA awards SPRANS grants to 1) address critical and emerging issues of regiona l and national significance in maternal and child health, and 2) support collaborative and innovative learning across states so programs can utilize existing best practices and evidence. Of the $139.1 million for SPRANS in FY 2021, Congress set aside approximately 11 percent to address four specific priorities: oral health, epilepsy, sickle cell disease, and fetal alcohol syndrome. In addition, 201 approximately 32 percent of the total SPRANS budget supports specific directives highlighted in the authorizing language, including genetics, hemophilia, training, and research. The remaining approximately 57 percent addresses critical and emerging issues in maternal and child health, such as maternal mortality and the COVID-19 pandemic, and supports collaborative lea rning across states. SPRANS awards also drive innovation and build capacity to improve systems of care for MCH populations and enables the Nation to address emerging issues. Funding provides critical programming that complements and ensures the success of state formula -funded activities by improving workforce and system capacity and the ability of programs to utilize best practices and evidence (e.g., through research, data collection, quality improvement, and workforce development). Critical and Emerging I ssues i n Maternal and Child Health Maternal mortality - HRSA supports a number of investments with SPRANS funding that are integral to HRSA's efforts to promote maternal health and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. In FY 2021, HRSA continued support for the State Maternal Health Innovation program (9 states), including a focus on access to care via alternative telehealth platforms to address needs resulting from the COVID -19 public health emergency . HRSA has also increased funding for the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) program with a goal of expanding implementation of the AIM program's maternal safety bundles across all U.S. States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories, as well as tribal entities. To date, 44 states and the District of Columbia are enrolled in AIM, with participation from 1,766 birthing facilities. Additional investments related to maternal health include the newly established Maternal Mental Health Hotline and the Women's Preventive Services Initiative. COVID-19 - SPRANS funding has been instrumental in addressing emerging public health issues that impact the MCH population, including COVID -19 response efforts. For example, HRSA launched the Promoting Pediatric Primary Prevention (P4) Challenge in December 2020 to incentivize innovations in pediatric primary care to increase well -child visits and immunizations within primary care settings in light of the COVID -19 pandemic. Innovations were deployed to address decreases in these services to prevent the spread of vaccine -preventable diseases such as measles and ensure children receive preventative care, crucial to their growth and development. Challenge participants generated more than 52,000 well -child visits and nearly 23,000 immunizations. Community Int e grat ed Service Systems (CISS) CISS grants are awarded on a competitive basis and support states and communities in building a comprehensive, integrated system of care to improve access and outcomes for all children, including children with special health care needs. For example, CISS funding supports the Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems (ECCS) program to enhance state -level capacity and infrastructure for integrated maternal and early childhood systems of care that lead to improved children's developmental health, family well-being, and increased family-centered access to care for the prenatal -to-3-year -old population. The program provides direct support and technical assistance to 20 states to build leadership capacity in early childhood systems, improve c ross- sector service coordination and alignment, improve policies and practices across sectors, and 202 advance health equity and health system improvements in early childhood so that more children are thriving at age three and school -ready by age five. The program was re -competed in FY 2021. Table 1. MCH Block Grant Activities in thousands) MCH Activities FY 2021 Final FY 2022 Continuing Resolution in $953,700,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant program of $953.7 million is $241.0 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. The Budget 203 includes $592.3 million for formula awards to states to promote and improve the health and well - being of the nation's mothers, children -including children with special needs -, and their families. Additionally, the Budget includes $351.1 million in SPRANS funding, of which $193.3 million will support HRSA's efforts to improve maternal and child health, including reducing maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. This is an increase of $158 million over the FY2022 Continuing Resolution. Building on the Improving Maternal Health Initiative investments, the FY 2023 Budget provides funding for investments to improve maternal he alth, with a specific focus on areas with high rates of adverse maternal health outcomes or with racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes. This funding includes new activities and continues support for existing activities: Addressing Emerg ing Issues and Social Determinants of Maternal Health: $55.0 million in new funding for a SPRANS innovation fund for community-based organizations to support priority tracks focused on reducing maternal mortality and adverse maternal health outcomes, parti cularly in areas with high rates of adverse maternal health outcomes and/or significant racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes including: o Maternal mental health equity : Projects will address maternal mental health conditions and substa nce use disorders with a focus on activities that expand access to services in areas with high rates of adverse maternal health outcomes and/or significant racial or ethnic disparities in maternal mental health access. . o Addressing social determinants of maternal health : Projects will provide community resources and programming, and support consultation and engagement with pregnant and postpartum individuals in developing a community needs assessment, among other resources, technical assistance, and support strategies. o Promoting equity in maternal health outcomes through digital tools : Projects will focus on reducing racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes by increasing access to effective digital tools related to expanding or enhancing maternal health care. o Expanding the use of technology -enabled collaborative learning and capacity building models for pregnant and postpartum individuals : Projects will focus on models that train maternal health care providers and students on methods to address implicit bias and racism; screen for social determinants of health; address behavioral health needs; and support remote patient monitoring, among other tools focused on improving maternal outcomes.

State Maternal Health Innovation Awards : $55.0 million, an increase of $3 2.0 million, to continue to support innovation among states to improve maternal health outcomes and address disparities in maternal health; Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health: $15.3 million, an increase of $6.3 million, to continue to expand the reach of evide nce-based models of maternity care to a broader array of providers and health care settings, support increasing AIM penetration in currently enrolled States, and improve systems that track, report, and improve upon maternity care services at the state, reg ional and national levels; Pregnancy Medical Home Demonstration : $25.0 million to continue to reduce adverse maternal health outcomes and maternal deaths by incentivizing maternal health care providers to provide integral health care services to pregnant w omen and new mothers; Maternal Mental Health Hotline : $7.0 million, an increase of $4 .0 million, to continue support for a maternal mental health hotline, staffed by qualified counselors 24 hours a day; Implicit Bias Training Grants for Health Providers : $5.0 million to continue to support to train providers on implicit bias with the goal of reducing racial disparities ; and National Academy of Medicine Study : $1.0 million to continue to support a partnership with the National Academy of Medicine study and make recommendations for incorporating bias recognition in clinical skills testing for accredited schools of allopathic medicine and accredited schools of osteopathic medicine. The Budget also provides $40.0 million to support a pilot initiative to integrate behavioral health supports in community settings to promote the healthy social and emotional development and mental health needs of mothers, children and their families. Grants will support traditionally underserved communities, including those within Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas, to engage and train community partners to identify the mental and behavioral health needs of mothers and children, and to support children's social and emotional development within their families. Navigators and community health workers will facilitate linkages to local resources, such as medical homes, school -based and other community health centers, community-based organizations, and local community social supports and services. This program will partner with HRSA's Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training (BHWET) for Paraprofessional program to support partnerships with local academic institutions that support training and placement of navigators in community settings in order to expand workforce capac ity and strengthen the behavioral health workforce pipeline. Additional SPRANS funding supports programs that aim to drive innovation and improve systems of care for MCH populations. These programs address emerging issues relating to disparities in materna l and child health outcomes and gaps in care related to the ongoing impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic on maternal and child health. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, an d information technology and other program support costs. 205 Outcomes and Outputs Tables Me asure Ye ar and Most Re cent Result /Target for Recent Result (Summary of Result) FY 2022 3010.01 : The percentage of childr en served by the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant122 (Outcome) FY Maintain 3010.02 : The percentage of pregnant women served by the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant (Outcome) FY 2020: 93% Target: 87% (Target Exceeded) 93% 93% Maintain 3010.03 : Decrease the ratio of the Black infant mortality rate to the White infant mortality rate (Output) FY 2020: 2.3 to 1123, 124 Target: 2 to 1 (Target Not Met) 2 to 1 2 to 1 Maintain 3010.04 : Reduce the infant mortality rate (Outcome) FY 2020: 5.4 per 1,000 Target: 5.5 per 1,000 (Target Met) 5.4 per 1,000 5.3 per 1,000 Decrease by 0.1 3010.05 : Reduce the incidence of low birth weight births (Outcome) FY 2020: 8.2% Target: 7.8% (Target Not Met but Improved) 8% 8% Maintain 122 The term \"children\" includes both infants and children (0 -21) years of age. 123 Numerator data for infant deaths by race: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics.

The Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program began in 2008 as authorized by the Combating Autism Act of 2006. The Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support, or Autism CARES Act reauthorized the program in 2019. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1 in 44 children have A SD, 128 while parent -reported data from the 2019-2020 National Survey of Children's Health documented that 1 in 35 children aged 3- 17 years have a diagnosis of ASD.129 Even though children can be diagnosed as early as two, on average, children identified with A SD are not diagnosed until after age four.130 There is also wide variability in the age of diagnosis of ASD by state and in many rural communities, children and families face disparities due to distance to subspecialists and a lack of available services. According to the CDC's 2018 Autism 128 Maenner MJ, Shaw KA, Bakian AV, et al.

The Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program supports training programs, research, and state systems grants to: Improve access to early screening, diagnosis, and intervention for children with ASD or other DDs; Increase the number of professionals able to diagnose ASD and other DDs; Promote the use of evidence -based interventions for individuals at higher r isk for ASD and other DDs as early as possible; Increase the number of professionals able to provide evidence -based interventions for individuals diagnosed with ASD or other DDs; Provide information and education on ASD and other DDs to increase public aw areness; Promote research and information distribution on the development and validation of reliable screening tools and interventions for ASD and other DDs; and Promote early screening of individuals at higher risk for ASD and other DDs. Training Progr ams The program has two main training components, the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Other Related Disabilities (LEND) Training program and the Developmental -Behavioral Pediatrics (DBP) Training program. LEND programs provide interdiscipli nary training to enhance the clinical expertise and leadership skills of professionals dedicated to caring for children with neurodevelopmental and other related disabilities including autism. DBP trains the next generation of leaders in developmental -beha vioral pediatrics and provides pediatric practitioners, residents, and medical students with essential biopsychosocial knowledge and clinical expertise. Data from FY 2020 showed that the LEND and DBP programs collectively: Provided diagnostic services to confirm or rule out ASD and other DDs to over 115,000 children; Provided training to over 59,000 trainees in the fields of pediatrics, developmental - behavioral pediatrics, other health professions, and people with lived experience; and Provided over 1,700 continuing education events on early screening, diagnosis, and intervention that reached over 128,000 pediatricians and other health professionals. 131 Maenner MJ, Shaw KA, Baio J, et al.

Research To improve the health and well -being of children and adole scents with ASD and other DDs, HRSA supports research networks, single investigator -led autism innovation projects, field- initiated research, and secondary data analysis projects. HRSA supports research and development of reliable screening tools and guide lines for ASD and other DD and the implementation of interventions to improve the physical and behavioral health of individuals with ASD and other DDs across the life course. HRSA also funds research to address barriers to diagnosis, access to care, and so cial determinants of health and health disparities with an explicit focus on recruiting participants from underserved populations. For example, the two largest Research Networks, the Autism Intervention Research Network on Physical Health (AIR -P) and the A utism Intervention Research Network on Behavioral Health (AIR -B), recruit diverse research participants with the target of including at least 60 percent of study participants from underserved populations, 132 a target these networks have met or exceeded. Collectively, these research investments address the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee Strategic Plan research questions around improving early identification and advancing effectiveness of interventions and services for children with ASD and other D D. Accomplishments from the Autism Research Networks and Autism Single Investigator Innovation Programs in FY 2020 include: Conducted 45 studies on physical and behavioral health issues related to ASD and other DDs, screening and diagnostic measures, early intervention, and transition to adulthood; Enrolled 9,496 participants in primary research studies through fifty-two research sites across the country and there were also 67,637 participants included in secondary data analyses; and 132 \"Underserved populations\" are defined as \"[The] populatio ns sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as ex emplified by the list in the definition of 'equity.'\" Ex ec utive Order 13985, at \u00a7 2(b). \"Equity\" is defined as \"[T]he consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisex queer (LG BTQ+) persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.\" Ex ecutive Order 13988 on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of G ender Identity or Sexual Orientation, 86 FR 2023, at \u00a7 1 213 Developed 137 peer -reviewed publications in leading scholarly journals. State Systems Grants The Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program supports state systems grants to improve access to comprehensive, coordinated health care and related services for children and youth with ASD and other DDs and their families in medically underserved areas. State systems grants promote access to more comprehensive coordinated services for ASD/DD by implementing family navigation and provider training. Family navigators perform time -limited case management for children with or at risk for ASD/DD; services may also include providing support to overcome patient -specific barriers to care in a complex system, coordinating services and appointments, and facilitating communication among fa milies and providers. During 2019- 2021 state awardees: Partnered with 43 primary care practices, employed 28 family navigators and served 825 families by providing children with/at risk of ASD/DD screening, diagnosis, and referral to early intervention or related services and enrolling them in community-based services before 36 months of age; Promoted and facilitated developmental screening services and follow -up. Grantees increased awareness through stakeholder meetings, online learning communities, or one - time trainings that covered autism generally, intervention services, and assistance programs. Grantees engaged family members and family advocates through trainings or training institutes, steering committees, and family support organizations through: o 13 webinars for primary care physicians (PCPs) reaching 115 attendees; o Six community trainings reaching approximately 6,000 participants; o Nine family leadership training participants and 293 parent attendees at various training activities; and o Approximately 600 parents participated in various dissemination activities. Funding History FY Amount FY $57,344,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program of $57.3 million is $4.0 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. This request will support training programs, research, and state systems with a focus on improving access, quality, 214 and systems of care for underserved children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD or other DDs. This requested funding will allow the program to serve approximately 125,000 children. This funding will also support the LEND and DBP programs to address unmet needs and disparities in evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment. Funding will allow expansion of the DBP program including increased fellowship opportunities for existing awardees . The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects over 100,000 individuals in the U.S. and disproportionately affects Black (1 of every 365 births) and Hispanic Americans (1 of every 16,300 births). 135 While life expectancy of individuals with SCD has increased with advances in science and medicine, affected populations have not benefitted equally from therapies. Individuals with SCD have unequal access to comprehensive, quality health care and treatment due to uneven distribution of specialized providers, reduced comfort among primary care providers in treating and caring for individuals with SCD, limited training of primary care providers, and social factors, including racism, income and stigma. SCDTDP awardees work to address these barriers and improve the prevention and treatment of the complications of sickle cell disease by: Coordinating service delivery; Assessing patient need for genetic counseling and testing, and providing referrals as appropriate; Providing guidance and technical assistance; 135 https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/data.html 217 Implementing telehealth an d telementoring strategies, to educate health professionals on evidence -based treatment of sickle cell disease; and Expanding and coordinating patient education, treatment, and care continuity. The program works to improve health equity by increasing ac cess to evidence-based care provided in the communities in which SCD patients live, increasing access to the latest treatment options, and continuing telehealth support for access to services. The program also fosters partnerships between clinicians and community organizations, partners with communities of practice to improve the quality of care provided to patients with SCD, and educates providers, families, and patients to improve knowledge and capacities, particularly as patient transition into adult hea lth care settings. In the last cycle of funding, August 1, 2017\u2014July 31, 2021, the program annually served over 25,000 individuals in 51 sites, worked with 49 community organizations, and had about 200,000 health care provider touchpoints through telehealt h, telementoring, junior faculty coaching, grand rounds, and specialized COVID -19 seminars. Additionally, 77% of those served by the program had a hydroxyurea prescription in the past year (until recent years, the only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for sickle cell). A new funding cycle began in FY 2021 with five grants to develop and support Regional Coordinating Centers that cover the United States. The purpose of the SCDTDP is to increase access for individuals with S CD to quality, coordinated, comprehensive care by: 1) increasing the number of clinicians or health professionals knowledgeable about the care of SCD, including those participating in both telementoring and telemedicine activities, 2) improving the quality of care provided to individuals with SCD, and 3) improving care coordination with other providers. Funding History FY Amount FY $7,205,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Demonstration Program of $7.2 million is equal the FY 2022 Continuing Resol ution level. This request will continue support for regional SCD infrastructure, which strengthens the sickle cell disease system of care for individuals with sickle cell disease, their families, and clinicians. The program partners with states to develop and support comprehensive SCD care teams for supporting care across the lifespan; implements telehealth technologies for health care delivery, education, and health information services; increases access to evidence-based care and the latest treatment options; and increases collaboration and care coordination within each region. In response to the COVID- 19 global pandemic and needs identified by the sickle cell disease community, funding also 218 supports technical assistance around accessing care via telemedicine; and webinars and educational opportunities to raise awareness about vaccination access and safety. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

The program will identify trends over a two year period as the measure is developmental. Once the trend is analyzed, appropriate targets will be identifi ed and included in the FY 2024 budget justification. 219 Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Activity FY 2021 Final FY 2022 --- FTE 4 4 4 --- Authorizing Legislation - Public Health Service Act, Title III, Section 399M, as amended by Public Law 115-71 FY 2023 Authorization ................................................................................................... Expired Allocation Methods: Competitive grant/co-operative agreement Program Description and Accomplishments The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) Program, reauthorized in 2017, supports the development of comprehensive and coordinated EHDI systems of care in states and jurisdictions. EHDI assures that families with newborns, infants, and young children up to three years of age that are deaf or hard of hearing receive appropriate and timely services that include hearing screening, diagnosis, and early intervention. This program focuses on: Increasing health prof essionals' engagement in and knowledge of the EHDI system; Improving access to early intervention services and language acquisition; and Improving family engagement, education, partnership, and leadership to strengthen family support. The EHDI Program f unds 59 competitive grants to states and jurisdictions to develop comprehensive and coordinated statewide EHDI systems of care, as well as two technical resource centers that support these efforts. The program also empowers families to serve as leaders thr ough activities which train families as leaders, increase family engagement, and strengthen family support in EHDI systems of care. To address health equity, awardees are required to develop plans to address diversity and inclusion in the EHDI system by the end of FY 2021 to ensure their activities are inclusive of and address the needs of the populations they serve. Since the program's inception, states and jurisdictions have had significant success in identifying newborns and infants who are deaf or hard of hearing. Funding also supports supplemental awards to 12 Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities training programs supported by the Autism and Developmental Disabilities program to train future leaders in pediatric audiology. 220 In 2019, 98.4% of births had hearing screening before one year of age.137 Additionally, the EHDI Program continues to work with states to meet the Healthy People 2030 objectives of screening no later than one month of age, conducting audiologic evaluations no later than three months of age, and enrollment in early intervention services no later than six months of age (1-3-6 objectives). In 2019, 97.7% of infants were screened before one month of age, 79.1% were diagnosed before three months of age, and 72.5% were enrolled in early intervention before six months of age. 138 A lack of comprehensive data reporting requirements for service providers in states and variability across states in timely access to such providers, among other factors, continues to be a challenge. Overall system improvements have led to more infants being screened and identified as deaf or hard of hearing, and fewer infants being lost to follow -up (when an infant does not receive the recommended followup services), or lost to documentation (when an infant has received services, but results have not been reported to the EHDI Program and, therefore, cannot be documented). In addition, the EHDI Program encourages awardees to develop an integrated EHDI health information system that allows communication and protected data sharing among health care providers to ensure that newborns, infants, and young children up to three years of age receive pertinent screenings and follow -up services. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, 55 awardees and the two techni cal resource centers used program funding to strengthen telehealth capacities at the state level. Example activities include promoting remote screening and follow -up via tele -audiology and access to teleintervention and support for families. Funding Hi story FY Amount Request The FY 2023 Budget Request of $17.8 million for the Early Hearing Detection and Interve ntion Program is equal to the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. The Budget Request will continue to support 59 competitive grants to states and jurisdictions, in addition to two technical resource centers and supplemental awards to 12 Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities training programs to train future leaders in pediatric audiology. 137 2019 CDC EHDI Hearing Screening & Follow -up Survey (HSFS) data. https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/ehdi -data.html 138 Ibid 221 The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information tec hnology, and other program support costs.

The majority of the nation's children are treated in community and rural emergency departments (EDs) close to where they live, rather than in specialized pediatric medical care centers. In addition, emergency medi cal services (EMS) agencies and hospital EDs often lack the necessary equipment and resources to treat children adequately. The Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) Program, reauthorized under the EMSC Reauthorization Act of 2019, is the only federal grant program specifically focused on ensuring that seriously ill or injured children have access to high-quality pediatric emergency care, no matter where they live in the United States. The EMSC Program aims to ensure that all EMS agencies and hospi tal EDs are equipped to provide appropriate medical care for children, including access to pediatric -specific equipment, medications, and transportation (e.g., ambulances). In addition, EMS personnel must be knowledgeable and skilled in carrying out pediat ric emergency care and have access to pediatric transport guidelines. It is critical that EMS systems are optimally prepared to provide high-quality pediatric care in both prehospital and hospital settings. In recent years, the EMSC Program has invested in: The EMSC State Partnership Program which aims to improve pediatric emergency care across 58 states and jurisdictions; The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) and Targeted Issues grants, which aim to carry out rigorous clinical res earch to develop evidence -based optimal pediatric emergency care guidelines; 224 The EMSC Innovation and Improvement Center, which guides EMSC State Partners and other EMS stakeholders to disseminate and increase uptake of evidence -based approaches to pediatr ic emergency care in each state and jurisdiction; and The EMSC Data Center, which tracks performance improvement efforts across all funded states and jurisdictions and serves as a central data coordinating entity for ongoing PECARN research. Notable accom plishments of the EMSC Program include : Increased our Understanding of the Importance of Pediatric Readiness: In 2021, a HRSA -funded Targeted Issues study found that children with trauma who were cared for in a trauma center ED with high level of pediatri c readiness were less likely to die than children cared for in a trauma center ED with low pediatric readiness. These findings suggest that if all children in the U.S. were cared for in a trauma center ED with high pediatric readiness, we may be able to save an additional 126 children each year145; Increased the Institutionalization of Pediatric Guidelines in Hospitals: Between 2018 and 2021, the proportion of hospitals with written interfacility transfer guidelines covering pediatric patients increased from 58% to 62% 146; Integrated EMSC Priorities into Statutes and Regulations: As of 2020, seven states required the designation of a pediatric emergency care champion in prehospital EMS agencies; and 12 states required EMS providers to demonstrate the correct use of pediatric -specific equipment; Increased Pediatric Workforce Oversight in Prehospital EMS Agencies: The proportion of EMS agencies with a pediatric emergency care champion increased from 30% in 2019 to 36% in 2021 147; Advanced EMSC Science and Clinical P ractice: In 2021, PECARN identified new, more effective approaches to treating children in a diabetic crisis that reduce risk of poor health outcomes 148, 149; 145 Newgard CD, Lin A, Olson LM, Co ok Malveau S, Smith M, Dai M, Nathens AB.

EMSC agencies are a critical resource in responding to childhood trauma, youth suicide (now the second leading cause of death for people aged 10-34154), and the health and social/emotional impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on children. Currently, of the EMS agencies reporting, only 25% require EMS practitioners to demonstrate the effective use of pediatric equipment, 36% have dedicated pediatric emergency care coordinators, and only 62% of hospitals have inter - facility transfer guidelines, all of which are critical for improving pediatric readiness and improving outcomes.155 Additional funding to states will help to increase readiness in EMS agencies and hospitals across the country through additional personnel, quality improvement initiatives, and pediatric specialized training. Funding will also support State EMSC programs to build mental health capacity for children in EDs. Th is growing issue is particularly important from an equity standpoint \u2014Black children have 1.5 times the rate of mental health diagnoses in the ED compared to White children, and the rate of mental health -related ED visits has increased faster for Black chil dren compared to White children.156 Funding will provide additional support to EMS agencies and EDs for training to appropriately respond to these diagnoses. The funding request also includes costs associated with data coordination activities, grant reviews and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs.

Major and persistent racial and ethnic disparities exist for infant mortality, maternal mortality, and other adverse outcomes such as preterm birth and low birth weight. Following a plateau between 2000 and 2005, the U.S. infant mortality rate declined more than 21 percent overall between 2005 162and 2020163 to a record low of 5.42 infant deaths per 10,000 live births. However, the non-Hispanic Black infant mortality rate is more than two and a hal f times that for non-Hispanic Whites.164, 165 In 2020, the five leading causes of infant mortality in the U.S. included birth defects, preterm birth and low birthweight, sudden infant death syndrome, 162 Centers for Dis ease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics.

Preterm birth (defined as birth at less than 37 completed weeks of gestation) is a key risk factor for infant death. Approximately t wo-thirds of all infant deaths occur among infants born preterm.167 After declining from 2007 to 2014, the U.S. preterm birth rate increased nearly 6.9 percent from 9.57 percent in 2014 to 10.23 percent in 2019168; however, between 2019 and 2020 it dropped to 10.1 percent, a 1% decline.169 Non-Hispanic Black women continue to be more likely to experience preterm birth than non-Hispanic White women (14.4 and 9.1 percent, respectively, in 2020). 170 Healthy Start aims to reduce these disparities by supporting high-ris k women and their families with accessing needed services to improve the health of mothers and children before, during, and after pregnancy. Healthy Start targets communities with infant mortality rates that are at least 1\u00bd times the U.S. national average and/or with high indicators of poor perinatal outcomes, particularly among non- Hispanic Black and other disproportionately affected populations. In FY 2022, Healthy Start funded 101 competitive grants in 35 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Healthy Start grantees use four approaches to reduce infant mortality through individua l services and community support to women, infants, and families : Improve women's health before, during, and between pregnancies; Improve family health and wellness to improve infant health and development; Promote systems change to maximize opportunities for community action to address social determinants of health; and Assure impact and effectiveness by conducting ongoing Healthy Start workforce development, data collection, quality improvement, performance monitoring, and evaluation. Healthy Start implements community-based interventions and helps to ensure a well -prepared, quality workforce; supports information systems for client services coordination and data reporting; and supports ongoing evaluation and quality improvement at the local and national levels. The Healthy Start service delivery model engages the entire family, working with women and their families before, during, and after pregnancy, and through t he first 18 months after birth. With the recent emphasis on including the partners of enrolled women, the program has begun actively recruiting fathers/males in education, activities, services, and events. Service provision begins with direct outreach by H ealthy Start community health workers to women who are at an increased risk of adverse maternal health outcomes. Each enrolled Healthy Start family receives a standardized, comprehensive assessment that considers physical and behavioral health, 166 NCHS Data Brief No. 427, December 2021; Mortality in the United States, 2020 (cdc.gov) 167 Ely DM, Driscoll AK.

Healthy Start delivers services using a range of approaches, including on-site services, in -home visits, and services provided at community locations/events. Services incorporate: Referrals and ongoing health care coordination for well -woman, prenatal, postpartum, and well -child care; Case management and linkage to social services; Alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use counse ling; Nutritional counseling and breastfeeding support; Perinatal depression screening and linkage to behavioral health services; Inter-conception education and reproductive life planning; and Child development education and parenting support. Healthy Star t grantees work with individual communities to build upon their existing resources to improve the quality of, and access to, healthcare for women, infants, children, and men. Every Healthy Start project has a Community Action Network (CAN) composed of neighborhood residents, key community leaders, perinatal care clients or consumers, medical and social service providers, as well as faith -based and business community representatives. Together they identify and address barriers in their community, including f ragmented service delivery, lack of culturally appropriate health and social services, and barriers to accessing care. The CANs also coordinate care and help ensure the maximum and non-duplicated use of resources and services. Healthy Start projects collab orate with federal, state, and local programs, including but not limited to: the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program; Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); Early Head Start; Title V State Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant; Medicaid; Children's Health Insurance Program; and local perinatal systems such as those in community health centers. These collaborations strengthen the services provided and help reduce risk factors, such as s ubstance use during pregnancy, while promoting healthy behaviors that can lead to improved outcomes for women and their families. Healthy Start may also provide home visiting services, but in communities where there is a home visiting program, programs are expected to collaborate in order to maximize coordination and minimize duplication. HRSA supports program implementation through technical assistance, training, and education provided to grantees by the Healthy Start EPIC Center ( www.healthystartepic.org ). EPIC Center services include strengthening staff skills to implement evidence -based practices in maternal and child health; facilitating grantee -to-grantee sharing of expertise and lessons learned from the field; and sharing resources for effective program delivery. The EPIC Center has been instrumental in providing COVID -19-related training to Healthy Start grantees whose programs and program participants have been impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Informa tion gathered through grantee listening sessions conducted through the EPIC Center has informed trainings for grantees on how to adapt in-person services to remote or virtual services to protect the health and safety of their clients and staff. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the EPIC Center has worked 231 with Postpartum Support International (PSI) to provide virtual support groups for Healthy Start clients and virtual wellness coaching for Healthy Start staff. In FY 2019, Healthy Start began supporting a new initiative to reduce maternal mortality through hiring of clinical services providers (e.g., nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, and other maternal -child advance practice health professionals) to provide clinical services, s uch as well -woman care and maternity care services, within program sites nationwide. In FYs 2020 and 2021, HRSA used $15 million to support these activities within existing Healthy Start awards. To date, 93 grantees have received clinician funding. Progra m Accomplishments Key program accomplishments highlighted below reflect FY 2020 outcomes among Healthy Start program participants. This is the second year of data reporting for the cohort of grantees initially funded in FY 2019. In FY 2020, the program did not meet any of the three performance measure targets for timely prenatal care utilization, low birthweight, or number of participants served, potentially reflecting the impact of the pandemic on service provision and participation, as well as the program 's focus on reaching the highest risk populations in communities with elevated rates of infant mortality and adverse perinatal outcomes. While the program did not meet these targets, the program saw significant improvements across all three measures in FY 2020, as compared to the previous year's outcomes. The Healthy Start program served approximately 61,000 women and children in FY 2020, in addition to nearly 5,000 men. During the same period, Healthy Start programs screened 93 percent of women participants for depression with 74 percent of those who screened positive receiving referral for services. In addition, with the funding made available starting in FY 2019 to hire more clinical service providers as part of the initiative to reduce maternal mortality , 93 Healthy Start grantees have hired 198 new clinical providers. Between November 2019 and October 2021, these clinicians provided 29,644 in-person visits and nearly 15,000 telehealth visits, including well-woman care, prenatal care, postpartum care, and behavioral health counseling. The infant mortality rate in the United States for 2018-2020 (three -year average) was 5.56 per 1,000 live births. The 2018-2020 (three -year average) infant mortality rate among Healthy Start participants was 7.04 per 1,000 li ve births, which reflects the high-risk populations targeted by the program. 171 The previous three -year (2017-2019) average infant mortality rates were 5.68 per 171 A multi -year infant mortality rate (IMR) is reported for 201 8-2020. This allows the Healthy Start program to track infant mortality while taking into consideration that infant death is a rare event . When cal culated within small populations, such as the Healthy Start program population, IMRs can appear to change substantially if there is even a small difference in the number of deaths within a single year. Such changes may be due to normal variation and are no t necessarily caused by actual change in the underlying risk. The IMRs for the single years 201 7 to 20 20 are as follows: 2017: Healthy Start 9.47 per 1,000 live births, United States 5.79 per 1,000 live births 2018: Healthy Start 6.26 per 1,000 live births, United States 5.67 per 1,000 live births 2019: Healthy Start 8.05 per 1,000 live births, United States 5.58 per 1,000 live births 2020: Healthy Start 6.99 per 1,000 live births, United States 5.42 per 1,000 live births 232 1,000 live births in the U.S. and 7.98 per 1,000 live births for Healthy Start participants.172 Comparing the three -year infant mortality rate averages for the periods of 2018-2020 and 2017- 2019, the U.S. three -year infant mortality rate decreased by 2.1 percent, whereas the Healthy Start three -year infant mortality rate decreased by 11.8 percent. This is the third year in which the program is monitoring and reporting a multi -year infant mortality rate among the Healthy Start participants. Healthy Start is committed to data -driven and evidence -based decision-making. In FY 2020, HRSA invested in a one -year contract to design an evaluation plan for the Healthy Start program with the secondary purpose of assessing grantee data collection and evaluation capacity. The resulting grantee organizational assessment and Healthy Start Evaluation Design Plan inform ed the development of the Healthy Start Evaluation and Capacity Building Support statement of work, which was competed and awarded at the end of FY 2021 for a four -year period of performance. These efforts continue to build from evaluation work that began in 2017 when Healthy Start initiated a national evaluation to explore associations between program participation, participant -level characteristics (such as race, health insurance coverage, pre- existing conditions, income, age), and program outcomes. F indings from the evaluation showed positive outcomes related to program goals.173 These include earlier and more frequent prenatal care visits, greater engagement in infant safe sleep practices, and lower rates of low birth weight deliveries. Healthy Start participants also met or exceeded targets with respect to usual source of care and depression screening. Funding History FY Amount FY $145,000,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Healthy Start program of $145.0 million is $17.0 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution. This increase will support a new, targeted expansion of an enhanced Healthy Start program mode l in 12 new communities with the highest rates of perinatal health disparity in the country. This expansion aims to reduce racial disparities in poor Healthy Start Data Source: Healthy Start Aggregate Reporting Spreadsheet U.S. IMR multi -year infant mortality rate (IMR). 173 Abt Associates (2020).

An estimated 9,600 additional women and infants will receive critical direct and enabling services with this additional funding with additional broader individual and community benefits resulting from structural and syst em improvements . This investment will include two program components: 1) 12 new awards of approximately $1.2 million each in communities not currently served by a Healthy Start program, and 2) a resource center that will provide technical assistance to new enhanced Healthy Start program model awardees. Technical assistance will include identification and dissemination of evidence-based practices (including community-driven interventions) to address social and environmental factors contributing to perinatal health disparities; scaling of efforts to address systemic and structural factors influencing health disparities in communities served; data collection and reporting; and product development. New Healthy Start award recipients will build on the program's past success by more precisely targeting expansion to 12 new communities with the highest rates of perinatal health disparity in the country\u2014reaching communities that account for up to 30% of excess Black infant deaths. 174 HRSA will leverage two ongoing analytic efforts to identify and target need and geographic priority for the new Healthy Start awards to communities with high rates of adverse maternal health outcomes (e.g. perinatal health risk) and infant health disparities. Grant recipients will continue to support individual physical and behavioral client interventions while also addressing the unique structural, environmental, and systemic factors that contribute to disparities in poor outcomes for mothers and their babies. Grant recipients will engage a broader set of partners \u2014 from sectors such as education, labor, justice, and housing\u2014in order to provide enabling services and address social determinants of maternal and infant health. Efforts may include support in accessing health insurance coverage, add ressing inadequate or potentially hazardous housing, offering legal aid to assist women, or leveraging existing policies and supports such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC), among other community, social and economic support services in order to significantly reduce racial disparities in perinatal health outcomes by 2030. Heathy Start funding also continues $15.0 mill i on in support for grantees to hire clinical service providers at Healthy Start sites to provide direct acces s to well woman care and maternity care services. This will reduce barriers to care and better address health disparities among high -risk and underserved women. In FY 2023, the program will continue to serve women and families across the nation through the 101 grants awarded in the FY 2019 funding cycle. At this funding level, Healthy Start expects to serve at least 82,000 participants in FY 2023 with case management services. Recognizing that improving birth outcomes begins with improving women's health be fore, during, and between pregnancies, funding will continue to improve access to quality healthcare and support services for women and children throughout the prenatal, postpartum, and inter -conception periods. The funding request also includes costs associated with the Healthy Start Monitoring and Evaluation Data ( HSMED), as well as grant 174 I.e., Deaths that occur due to higher mortality rates relative to non -Hispan ic White infants and can be referred to as deaths attributable to disparity or deaths that need to be prevented to achieve equity in infant mortality rates . 234 review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs.

Four million newborns each year are screened for at least 30 of the 35 core conditions on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), a list of conditions recommended by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for state newborn screening programs . Babies testing positive for one of these conditions receive early intervention and treatment to prevent serious problems such as brain damage, organ damage, and even death. Newborn screening saves or improves the lives of nearly 13,000 babies in the United States each year. The program is composed of the following: The Newborn Scree ning Family Education Program seeks to increase awareness, knowledge, and understanding of newborn screening for parents, families, patient advocacy and support groups, as well as the public at large. The program develops and delivers educational programs about newborn screening, counseling, testing, follow -up, treatment, and specialty services. In 2020 the program launched a free online training for families, and developed resources that highlighted newborn screening resources and access to services during the COVID -19 pandemic. The Regional G enetics Netw or ks enhance, improve, or expand access to screening, counseling, and health care services for newborns and children having or at risk for genetic disorders. The networks link patients to genetic services and provide resources to genetic service providers, public health officials, and families. During FY 2021, the program served 18,697 individuals and families through education and training, 236 facilitating connections to genetic services, and facilitating telehealth services. Of those, 5,977 were from medically underserved populations. In FY 2021 the program provided education and training to 6,789 professionals, including genetics providers and primary care providers, through webinars and in-person sessions. Long -Term Follow -Up for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) Implementation and Other Newborn Screening Conditions Program supports comprehensive, collaborative models of long-term follow -up between clinicians, public health agencies, and families. The program expands the ability of state public health agencies to provide screening, counseling, and services to children identified through newborn screening. The program also supports collaboration with clinicians, public health agencies, and families to cr eate a system of care that can assess and coordinate follow -up and treatment of SCID and/or other newborn screening conditions. The Advancing, Improving, and Measuring Newborn Screening System Programs will support and strengthen state public health agenc ies and newborn screening system partners to provide screening, counseling, or health care services to newborns and children with, or at risk for, heritable disorders. In FY2023, the se new programs, including up to 22 awards to states and a national coordi nating center, will collectively work to improve identification of newborns and children with heritable disorders, including increased NBS timeliness and implementation of new conditions added to the recommended uniform screening panel (RUSP), to improve s hort-term and long-term follow -up outcomes for infants and families identified through NBS, and to increase access to follow -up for individuals and families with conditions identified through NBS. In FY 2020, the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children was re -established as a discretionary committee. The Committee continues to provide national newborn screening guidance and standards as well as advise the Secretary on reducing mortality or morbidity from heritable disorders, conduct evidence -based reviews of conditions to recommend updates to the RUSP, and consider ways to ensure state and jurisdiction capacity to screen for RUSP conditions. Since 2009, the program also supports the Clearinghouse of Newborn Screening Information as a central source of current educational and family support information, materials, resources, research, and data on newborn screening. The Newborn Screening Information Center (NBSIC) is inte ractive and contains links to various resources including government -sponsored, non-profit organizations, laboratories, and other organizations with expertise in newborn screening; research -based information on newborn screening tests currently available t hroughout the United States; and information about newborn conditions and screening services available in each state. From September 2020 to August 2021, the NBSIC had over 100,000 page views. In response to the COVID -19 globa l pandemic and needs expressed by newborn screening programs across the nation, NewSTEPs, the Newborn Screening Family Education Program, and the Regional Genetics Networks provided technical assistance to states around laboratory supply and support needs; emergency and contingency planning tools and resources, including information about access to care through telehealth; and educational materials to their constituents and stakeholders. 237 The program addresses health equity through the Regional Genetics Networks and the Newborn Screen ing Education program, which aim to increase access to genetic services and information for underserved populations. Additionally, The Western States Regional Genetics Network has developed a national minority genetics professional network to support and e ncourage increased diversity across all genetics professions. Funding History FY Amount FY $18,883,000 Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children program of $18.9 million is equal to the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution. This request will invest $18.9 million to continue support of the projects and associated awards that comprise the Her itable Disorders in Newborns and Children program. This includes continued support of state and local public health agencies, public health professionals, and primary and specialty care providers in their ability to provide screening, counseling, and healt h care services to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by heritable disorders in newborns and children. The program will continue to fund efforts to increase awareness, knowledge and understanding of newborn screening and enhance, improve, or expand acce ss to screening, counseling, and health care services for newborns and children having or at risk for genetic disorders. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and informat ion technology and other program support costs.

These programs provide tele -consultation, training, technical assistance, and care coordination support for pediatric primary care providers to diagnose, treat and refer children with behavioral health conditions. This program works to address the shortages of psychiatrists, developmental - behavioral pediatricians, and other behavioral health clinicians who can identify behavioral disorders in children and adolescents and provide appropriate services through telehealth technologies that support and promote long-di stance clinical health care, clinical consultation, and patient and professional health-related education . In 2019, over 1 in 5 children ages of 3 to 17 had some type of mental, emotional, developmental, or behavioral condition or problem. 179 While the need for and receipt of treatment varies by condition, some analyses indicate that children with behavioral/conduct problems are less likely to receive care than those with anxiety problems or depression. Significant disparities exist in access to behavioral health care. Studies have generally found lower behavioral health service utilization among Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino children, compared with White children. 180 Black/African American children residing in urban areas and Hispanic/Latino children residing in both rural and urban areas are less likely to be connected to mental health care than White children. White children in rural areas are significantly less likely to receive 179 Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative.

Often, pediatric primary care providers are the first responders in behavioral disorder identification and service provision. However, they may not have the knowledge and training to screen, diagnose , and treat behavioral disorders. Patients may also lack access to needed services, leading to conditions severe enough to impair child, adolescent, and family functioning, school performance, and safety. Telehealth strategies, like the ones supported by the PMHCA Program, connect primary care providers with specialty mental and behavioral health care providers. This can be an effective means of increasing access to mental and behavioral health services for children and adolescents, especially those living in rural and other underserved areas. Results from this program will be shared with the field and scaled up as feasible and appropriate. PMHCA program award recipients address increases in behavioral health concerns among children and adolescents related to the COVID -19 pandemic, including increased reports of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation and attempts. PMHCA program award recipients also support resilience strategies among families and clinicians. In FY 2020, 182 PMHCA recipients achieved the f ollowing: Over 4,500 primary care providers in 21 states enrolled in a statewide or regional PMHCA program. Over 3,000 tele -consultations were provided and approximately 3,800 providers were trained. Approximately 3,000 children and adolescents overall w ere served by pediatric primary care providers who contacted the pediatric mental health team. Approximately 2,000 children and adolescents living in rural and underserved counties were served by pediatric primary care providers who contacted the pediatri c mental health team. Section 2712 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117-2) (ARP) provides $80 million in funding to support pediatric mental health care access and promote behavioral health integration into pediatric primary care by supporting state or regional networks of pediatric mental health care teams. HRSA awarded 24 additional PMHCA projects in areas without current HRSA -funded programs in FY 2021. This expansion increased the program reach from 21 awards in 21 states to 45 awards in 40 states, as well as the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Republic of Palau. It also provides support to two Tribal areas - the Chickasaw Nation and the Red Lake Band of the Chippewa Indians. HRSA is conducting a second ARP -PMHCA co mpetition in FY 2022 to fund up to 10 additional programs in states, 181 See f ootnote 2 on page 2 182 FY 2020 data covers a 12 -month period of work from 7/1/2 019-6/30/2020 and 9/30/20 20-9/29/2021 (Hae Y oung Note: this edited date is not correct: it should be changed back to 9/30/2019 -9/29/2020) . 240 political subdivisions of states, Indian Tribes, and Tribal organizations not currently supported by a HRSA PMHCA program. .

The program's long-term goal is to improve the mental health and well -being of pregnant and postpartum women and, in turn, their infants' social and emotional development. The program aims to: Increase universal screening among providers participating in the program; Support timely detection, assessment, treatment, and referral of maternal mental health conditions by participating providers using evidence -based practices; and Improve access to treatment and recovery support services that are affordable, culturally and linguistically appropriate, and community-based or provided via telehealth. There are approximately 64 million women of childbearing age in the United States (U.S.) and approximately 4 million women give birth each year. Despite advances in medical care and investments in improving access to care, the m aternal mortality rate has not improved. In 2020, 861 women died of maternal causes, representing a maternal mortality rate of 23.8 deaths per 245 100,000 live births.190, 191 Data from 14 U.S. Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs) showed that from 2008 to 2017, mental health conditions were a leading underlying cause of pregnancy-related death.192 These included deaths to suicide, drug overdose or poisoning, and unintentional injuries, during pregnancy and up to one year after childbirth. Depression is a com mon complication of pregnancy. In 2018, 13% of women with a recent live birth reported depressive symptoms during the postpartum period.193 Additional data from the National Inpatient Sample indicate that the rate of depression diagnoses during delivery hospitalizations increased by sevenfold from 2000-2015.194 Additionally, substance misuse can co-occur with mental disorders and is at least as common as some other medical conditions that are typically screened for during pregnancy.195 These issues affect not on ly the mother, but can also affect maternal -infant bonding and the child's cognitive and emotional development. Intervening early and offering integrated services and support can prevent or reverse these effects. Despite the importance of screening and ea rly intervention, these services are often unavailable due to limited access to behavioral health resources for front -line health care providers. A nationwide shortage of psychiatrists, especially perinatal psychiatrists, compounds this issue. Women in rur al and medically underserved areas are especially vulnerable to these shortages and experience poorer health outcomes than urban women. 196 As awardees ramped up from the first to the second year, the Screening and Treatment for Maternal Depression and Relat ed Behavioral Disorders Program demonstrates improved short and intermediate -term outcomes: Training Awardees trained 1,085 providers in FY 2020, an increase from 160 providers trained in FY 2019. Providers received training on a variety of evidence -based practices such as: Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT); Medication Assisted Treatment; use of standardized validated screening tools for perinatal depression and anxiety; behavioral health integration in primary care settings; and training on perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. Providers trained included obstetricians/gynecologists, psychiatrists, licensed clinical social workers, licensed professional counselors, nurses/nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, care 190 https://w onder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D158/D98F942 191 https://w onder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D149/D98F943 DG.

The PCP supports PCCs ' efforts to: 1) prevent and provide treatment recommendations for poisonings; 2) comply with operational r equirements to sustain accreditation and/or achieve accreditation; and 3) improve and enhance communications and response capability and capacity. Funds may also be used to improve the quality of data uploaded from poison control centers to the National Po ison Data System in support of national toxic surveillance activities conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The national toll -free Poison Help line was established in 2001. Individuals can call from anywhere in the U.S. and the territories and connect to the PCCs that serve their respective areas. The PCP maintains the number, provides interpretation services in over 150 languages, and offers services for the hearing impaired. 251 Today, a network of 55 PCCs, supported by 52 grant awards, provides high quality, cost - effective, health care guidance regarding poisoning to the general public and health care providers across the U.S., including American Samoa, the District of Columbia, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Puerto Ri co, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The PCP ensures that the Poison Help line is operational, calls are routed to the appropriate PCC, and multilingual interpreter services are available. Twenty -four hours a day, seven days a week, health care providers and other specially trained toxicology experts provide assessments, triage, and treatment recommendations at no cost to callers. PCCs are consulted for a range of exposures including, for example, when a child swallows a household product; an adolescent ingests medication; a worker is exposed to harmful substances; or a senior takes an additional dose of a prescribed medication. Emergency 911 operators refer poison-related calls to PCCs, and health care professionals regularly consult PCCs for expert consultati on in managing poisonings. PCCs are critically important partners in emergency preparedness. A hallmark of PCP case management is the use of follow up calls to monitor case progress and document medical outcomes. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, PCCs managed 3.1 million encounters in 2020, a 28.9 percent increase from 2019. Although the number of human exposure poisonings remained unchanged in 2020 (2.1 million), PCCs experienced an increase in medical information requests, primarily related to COVID -19, with peaks in these requests documented in April 2020, July 2020 and November -December 2020. These peaks generally corresponded to the peaks in COVID -19 cases reported in the United States. Increases in calls regarding COVID - related substances included questions about cleaners/disinfectants (e.g., bleaches) in April, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in June, and COVID -19 vaccines in December. As in previous years, PCCs managed about 69 percent at the site of exposure; health ca re facilities made approximately 22 percent of calls to PCCs. The top 5 substance classes most frequently involved in all human exposures were analgesics (10.3%), household cleaning substances (8.4%), (4.9%). 214 Ninety -three percent of the cases occurred in a residence. Overall, PCCs continue to provide around-the -clock guidance that results in decreasing unnecessary visits to emergency departments, reducing health care costs, improving poison-related health outcomes, and serving as a trusted source of public health information. Through the nationwide Poison Help media campaign, the PCP has been educating the public about the toll -free number and increa sing awareness of poison control center services. In FY 2021, the Poison Help media campaign included an investment of $617,515. This campaign published almost 100 social media posts, resulting in nearly 1,000 engagements. Additionally, the campaign genera ted over 200 million impressions from public service announcements valued at over $9 million through over 35,000 airings on nearly 500 television and radio stations in over 200 markets. 214 2020 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS): 3 8th Annual Report 252 Another critical function of the PCCs is to collect poison exposure and surveillance data. Multiple Federal agencies, including the CDC, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Environmental Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, use these data for public health surveillance, including timely identification, characterization, or ongoing tracking of occurrences and other public health threats. Many state health departments collaborate directly with poison control centers within their jurisdictions, using da ta from poison control centers to monitor exposures to e -cigarette devices and liquid nicotine, synthetic cathinones and cannabinoids, opioids, hand sanitizer, and laundry detergent packets. According to the CDC, in 2020, there were 87,404 unintentional poisoning deaths at a rate of 26.5 per hundred thousand population. 215 Opioid -involved overdose deaths rose from 21,088 in 2010 to 46,802 in 2018 and remained steady in 2019 with 49,860 deaths.216 Poison Control Centers play a critical role in combatting opioid drug-related abuse and misuse, from helping to define and trace the problem within a local and national context to responding to calls from health care providers seeking treatment advice for patients. In addition, PCCs provide public and health care provider education and actively seek to change behaviors to reduce poisonings and promote awareness and use of PCC services. Education efforts include: partnering with health departments, education departments, and other state agencies; promoting safe prescri ption medication use and storage; messaging at health fairs and community events; and collaborating to develop media campaigns focused on preventing poisonings. Poison Control Centers participate in National Prescription Drug Take -Back events sponsored by the Drug Enforcement Agency to provide a safe, convenient, and responsible means of prescription drug disposal while also educating the public about potential medication abuses.

This request will support the 52 Poison Contr ol Center grants to maintain infrastructure and core triage and treatment services. Poison Control Centers predominantly rely on state and local funding, as Federal funding accounts for approximately 13 percent of total Poison Control Center funding. While Poison Control Centers have innovatively secured funding from a variety of local sources, including philanthropic organizations, their financial stability is tenuous. Federal funding helps reinforce the nationwide Poison Control Center infrastructure, ena bling Poison Control Centers to sustain their public health and toxic surveillance efforts. The FY 2023 Budget Request will also support continued maintenance of the national toll -free Poison Help line and interpretation services for non-English speaking callers. The Nationwide Media Campaign will continue to educate the public and health care providers about poisoning, toxic exposure prevention, and the availability of the national toll -free number. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs.

Staffed by family members who have first -hand experience using health care services and programs for CYSHCN, F2F HICs promote cost -effective, quality health care by providing patient -centered information, education, technical ass istance, and peer support to families of CYSHCN and health professionals. Initially authorized by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the program funded one health information center in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Since then, F2F HICs have been developed in all jurisdictions and also for Indian tribes . Most recently, the Sustaining Excellence in Medicaid Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-39) reauthorized the program through FY 2024. The F2F HICs empower families of CYSHCN to be partners in heal th care decision making by: Helping families gain the knowledge and skills to make informed health care choices that promote good treatment decisions, cost effectiveness, and improved health outcomes; Developing models for building working relationships be tween families and health professionals to assist in providing appropriate services and information; Providing training and guidance to health professionals on the care of CYSHCN; 219 Reflects post -sequestration level 220 Reflects post -sequestration level 221 Reflects post -sequestration level 256 Conducting outreach activities to families, health professionals, schools, a nd other appropriate entities to increase their knowledge of F2F HICs and the resources available for CYSHCN and their families; and Enlisting families of CYSHCN and health professionals to staff these efforts. Research supports the effectiveness of the F 2F HIC strategy.222 Evidence shows CYSHCN experience improved health outcomes and cost -savings when families are empowered to make informed choices about their care and partner with health professional s.223 Documented outcomes include: Improved transition from pediatric to adult health care systems; Fewer unmet health needs, better community-based systems; Fewer problems with specialty referrals; Lowered out -of-pocket costs; Improved physical and behavioral health; and Increased access to preventive health care in a medical home. Data for FY 2020 shows F2F HICs provided services to 207,815 families, which exceeded the target of 184,250 families. In addition, F2F HICs trained and provided information, resources, and referrals to 97,835 health professionals who serve CYSHCN and their families within community and state public health agencies, managed care and insurance organizations, medical practices, children's hospitals, universities, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and more.

FY 2023 funding will support 59 F2F HIC grants to enable families of CYSHCN to partner in health care decision making at all levels to improve health outcomes for CYSHCN and achieve cost-savings for families. The FY 2023 funding will help ensure continued delivery of patient - centered information, education, technical assistance, and peer support to families of CYSHCN. These family -staffed centers will provide other enabling support to families and health professionals serving them, including training and guidance to health professionals on the care of CYSHCN, and building joint worki ng relationships between families and health professionals to improve delivery of appropriate care. To address health equity, an objective of the F2F program is to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented and diverse communities trained to partner with families at all levels of decision making. The F2Fs are doing this through targeted outreach and leadership development to specific populations. Additionally, F2Fs participated in community forums and town halls led by Family Voices to addres s the impact of racism on CYSHCN and their families. To address the impact of COVID -19, in FY 2020, 56 awardees received funding through the CARES Act to help prepare families to access services through telehealth, especially those in underserved communit ies. Among other things, F2Fs purchased equipment, software, pre -paid phone cards, hot spots or data plans needed by families to access telehealth. The centers also provided training to over 3,000 families on telehealth. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs. 227 Funding is subject to sequestration. 258 Outcomes and Outputs Table228 Me asure Year and Most Recent Result /Targe t for Recent Result (Summary of Result) FY 2022 Number of families with CSHCN who have been provided information, education, and/or training from Family- to-Family Health Information Centers (Outcome) FY Exceeded) 200,000 : Number of professionals who serve CSHCN who have been provided information, education, and/or training from Family -to-Family Health Information Centers (Output and Developmental) FY 2020: 97,835229 Target: 84,700 (Target Exceeded) 100,000 100,000 Maintain 3100.03 : Percentage of families with CSHCN served who report that the information or services received from Family -to- Family Health Information Centers helped prepare them to work with those who serve their children (Outcome and Developmental) FY 2020: 89%230 Target: Not Defined 2021 and 2022 Targets for 15.III.C.1 and C.2 incorporate potential modifying effects of COV ID - 19.

Expired Allocation Methods: Direct federal/intramural Contract Formula grant/co-operative agreement Competitive grant/co-operative agreement Program De scription The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program supports voluntary, evidence -based home visiting services during pregnancy and to parents with young children up to kindergarten entry living in at -risk communities. The MIECHV Program builds upon decades of scientific research showing that home visits by a nurse, social worker, early childhood educator, or other trained professional during pregnancy and in the first years of life have the potential to improve the lives of children and families by: Helping to prevent child abuse and neglect; Encouraging positive parenting; Improving maternal and child health; and Promoting child development and school readiness. 233 FY2021 reflects the post -sequestration funding amount. 234 FY2022 reflects the post -sequestration funding amount. 261 By providing necessary resources and supports, home visiting empowers families. Evidence - based home visiting can be cost -effective in the long term, with the largest benefits coming through reduced spending on government programs and increased individual earnings.235 States, jurisdictions, and tribal entities participating in MIECHV direct their home visiting efforts to at-risk communities. The statute defines at -risk communities as those with concentrations of: Premature bi rth, low birth weight infants, and infant mortality, including infant death due to neglect, or other indicators of at -risk prenatal, maternal, newborn, or child health; Poverty; Crime; Domestic violence; High rates of high school Substance abuse ; Unemployment; or Child maltreatment. 236 Grantees deliver services by implementing one or more of 20 evidence -based home visiting models, selected by the grantee, which meet HHS -established evidence of effectiveness criteria and MIECHV criteria for impleme ntation. Administered by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), the Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness review (HomVEE) assesses the research literature to determine which home visiting models meet the HHS criteria for evidence of effectiv eness. While there is some variation across the 20 evidence -based home visiting models from which grantees may select (e.g., some programs serve pregnant people as well as parents with young children, while others only serve families after the birth of a c hild), all models share some common characteristics. In these voluntary programs, trained professionals meet regularly with expectant parents or families with young children in their homes, building strong, positive relationships with families who want and need support. Home visitors work with families to determine their specific needs and provide services tailored to those needs, such as: Teaching parenting skills and modeling effective parenting techniques; Promoting early learning in the home with an emphasis on positive interactions between parents and children and the creation of a language -rich environment that stimulates early language development; Providing information and guidance on a wide range of topics including breastfeeding, safe sleep posit ion, injury prevention, and nutrition; Conducting screenings and providing referrals to address caregiver depression, substance abuse, and family violence; Screening children for developmental delays and facilitating early diagnosis and intervention for a utism and other developmental disabilities; and Connecting families to other services and resources as appropriate. 235 Michalopoulos, C, et. al. (2017). Evidence on the Long -Term Effects of Home Visiting Programs: Laying the Groundwork for Long -Term Follow -Up in the Mother and Infant Home V isiting Program Evaluation (MIHOPE). OPRE Report 2017- 711(b)(1)(A). 262 MIECHV grantees have the flexibility to tailor the program to serve the specific needs of their states and communities. In order to meet t hose needs, grantees conducted needs assessments, which were updated by October 1, 2020, as required under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, to identify eligible at -risk communities, determine priority populations, and choose which approved evidence -based models or promising approaches for home visiting will be used. MIECHV currently distributes funds for delivery of early childhood home visiting services through two types of awards: 1. Formula Grants to states, jurisdictions, and nonprofit organizations. 2. Competitive Cooperative Agreements to Indian tribes (or a consortium of Indian tribes), tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations, as defined in section 4 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Additionally, three percent of appropriations i s set aside by statute for research, evaluation, and corrective action technical assistance to grantees. Formula grants to states, jurisdictions, and nonprofit organizations In FY 2021, HRSA awarded $342 million in MIECHV formula grants to 56 states, jur isdictions, and nonprofit organizations. Grants are generally administered by the lead state agency for home visiting designated by the Governor or can be competitively awarded to a nonprofit organization in those states or jurisdictions that opted not to participate in the grant program. By law, state and jurisdictional grantees must spend the majority of their MIECHV funds to implement evidence -based home visiting models, with up to 25 percent of funding available to implement promising approaches that undergo rigorous evaluation. In FY 2020, three states implemented and evaluated three promising approaches to better address the needs of their communities. Cooperative agreements to Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations Statute currently provides that three percent of funding is reserved for grants to Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations. As of FY 2020, a total of 30 tribal entities had received funding through the Tribal Home Visiting progra m, administered by ACF. Currently, there are 23 Tribal Home Visiting program grantees that receive five -year competitive awards. The Tribal Home Visiting Program is designed to: Develop and strengthen tribal capacity to support and promote the health and w ell-being of American Indian and Alaska Native families through home visiting programs; Expand the evidence base around home visiting in tribal communities; and Support and strengthen cooperation and linkages between programs that serve Native children and their families. Grantees may choose to implement either Family Spirit, the one evidence -based home visiting model with evidence of effectiveness in tribal communities, or a promising approach for home visiting (which includes any model that meets the ev idence of effectiveness criteria for the formula grants but does not have specific evidence of effectiveness in American Indian and Alaska Native populations). 263 Section 9101 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117-2) (ARP) appropriated $150 millio n to enable MIECHV Program recipients to address the needs of expectant parents and families with young children during the COVID -19 public health emergency. HRSA made formula -based awards to all MIECHV recipients to support direct COVID -related costs (e.g ., costs associated with shifting to virtual service delivery including the provision of technology-related items; basic supplies such as formula, diapers, and groceries to families; and hazard pay and other supports for staff) and expand services to famil ies in communities at risk for poor maternal and child health outcomes. HRSA will also use ARP funding to make competitive awards to MIECHV awardees to develop, implement, and evaluate data and technology innovations that leverage new technology and/or dat a collection or sharing strategies to improve MIECHV service delivery and extend the impact of MIECHV -funded voluntary evidence -based home visiting services to respond to the evolving and long-term impacts of the COVID -19 public health emergency. In addition, funds are being used to support current MIECHV recipients serving tribal communities and for administration of the program. Program Accomplishments MIECHV state and jurisdictional grantees provided over 8 million visits from FY 2012 through FY 2021. In FY 2021 states reported serving more than 140,000 parents and children in 1,065 counties across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories. This is more than a 300 percent increase in the number of participants served since FY 2012 ( see Tables 1 and 2 below). Tribal grantees provided over 142,500 home visits from FY 2012 to FY 2021 and served more than 3,500 parents and children in FY 2021.

These data 241 FY 2020 results were impacted by funding cuts due to sequestration, the impacts of COV ID -19 on enrollment and service delivery, and a reporting error in one state. 242 FY 2021 results were impacted by funding cuts due to sequestration and the impacts of COV ID -19 on enrollment and service delivery. 243 Reflects changes HRSA made to reporting definitions beginning in FY 2017 clarifying that only participants whose services were directly supported with federal funds should be included in MIECHV reports. 244 Does not include data from Puerto Rico and the U.S. V irgin Islands due to reporting delays caused by Hurricanes Maria and Irma. 245 Does not include data from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands due to reporting delays caused by Super Typhoon Y utu. 246 FY 2020 results were impacted by funding cuts due to sequestration, the impacts of COV ID -19 on enrollment and service delivery, and a reporting error in one state. 247 FY 2021 results were impacted by funding cuts due to sequestration and the impacts of COV ID -19 on enrollment and service delivery. 248 The HHS Poverty Guidelines are updated annually in February and published in the Federal Register. See https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty- guidelines 249 Performance data represent data submitted after three years of program implementation as required under Social Security Act, Title V, \u00a7 511(d)(1)(B) 265 indicate that 100 percent of states, jurisdictions, and non-profit grantees demonstrated improvement in at least four of the six benchmark areas as outlined in the legislation: Improving maternal and newborn health; Preventing child injuries, maltreatment, and emergency department visits; Improving school readiness and achievement; Reducing crime or domestic violence; Improving family economic self -sufficiency; and Improving service coordination and referrals for other community resources and supports. Since FY 2017, following a redesign of the MIECH V performance measurement system, grantees have been reporting on 19 standardized performance indicators and systems outcome measures. These performance measures allow grantees to more effectively monitor and understand program performance, and implement c ontinuous quality improvements in home visiting. The statute requires an evaluation of the MIECHV Program. To fulfill this requirement, the Mother and Infant Home Visiting Program Evaluation (MIHOPE) was initiated in 2011. Released in November 2018, 250 findings from the MIHOPE Implementation Report include: the local programs that participated in MIHOPE served eligible families in disadvantaged communities with high levels of socioeconomic risk as intended by the program; most home visitors were well educated, trained and experienced; local programs focused on improving parenting and child development outcomes; and the tailoring of services to families' needs was especially evident in areas of substance use, mental health, and intimate partner violence. The MIHOPE Impact Report, released in January 2019, 251 presents evidence that MIECHV -funded home visiting services had positive effects for the families that participated in services, including in the quality of the home environment and the frequency of psychological aggression towards the child. The study provides evidence that differences in effects among the evidence -based models included in the study are generally consistent with the models' area of focus. 250 Duggan, Anne, Ximena A.

Washington, DC: Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 266 Funding History FY Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request proposes mandatory funding of $467.0 million for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program. This is a $67.0 million 253 increase over the FY 2022 current law mandatory funding level. The FY 2023 Budget requests to extend and expand the program for FY 2023 through FY 2027 with an increase of $67.0 million per year over the five year s for a total of $3.0 billion. Funding will continue to support the state, jurisdictional, and tribal administration of locally-run, voluntary, evidence -based home visiting services that have been proven to help prevent child abuse and neglect, encourage positive parenting, and promote child development and school readiness. This level of funding will provide : Awards to 54 state and territory grantees and two non-profit organizations; Awards to approximately 27 tribal entities; and Support for research, evaluation, and technical assistance for both corrective action and program improvement for state, jurisdictional, and tribal MIECHV grantees. The increase in funds will expand the capacity of MIECHV awardees to reach more communities and families. Currentl y, MIECHV -funded programs serve 71,000 families at $400 million per year reaching approximately 15% of the more than 465,000 families who are likely currently eligible and in need of MIECHV services 254. Over 5 years, this funding increase will provide compre hensive, coordinated home visiting services to over 600 additional communities, including up to 165,000 additional families through targeted evidence -based home visiting. In FY 2025 - FY 2027, up to 95,000 additional families will be served through univers al home visiting approaches, which may be implemented by grantees as part of expansion efforts. The additional appropriations in FY 2023 and FY 2024 will be used to maintain service expansion supported by the American Rescue Plan Act funding to ensure f amilies are able to continue accessing services. Funds will also support the technology necessary for virtual service delivery as an option for families, as well as the recruitment and retention of the home visiting workforce, including increasing home vis itor supports, and training and hiring a diverse workforce. States and jurisdictions may also begin to plan for expansion of services to additional communities and families by improving community capacity to initiate services, and expanding 252 Reflects post -sequestration amounts in FY 2020, FY 2 021, and FY 2022. 253 Pre-sequestration funding level. 254 HRSA internal analysis using 2019 Current Population Survey data 267 the infrastruct ure to support home visiting service delivery. Awardees may also begin to plan for the use of universal home visiting initiatives and promising approaches responsive to local community needs that may be implemented with additional appropriations in FY 2025-FY 2027. Beginning in FY 2025, universal home visiting initiatives, which reach all postpartum women and children within an identified geographic area, may be introduced as part of a continuum of care with the targeted home visiting initiatives, which foc us on specific populations within an identified area. Additionally, new awards will be made to tribal entities to expand services to additional tribal communities. Funds will continue to support the statutory directive for an ongoing portfolio of research and evaluation on home visiting and technical assistance to ensure families have access to quality evidence -based and promising home visiting service delivery models. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

Nearly sixty one percent of clients (patients) live at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level and nearly three -quarters of RWHAP clients are from racial and ethnic minority p opulations.270 The RWHAP statute requires that the program is the \"payor of last resort,\" meaning RWHAP funds can only be used for allowable services not covered by other federal271 or state programs, or private insurance. Since 1990, RWHAP has developed a com prehensive system of safety net providers who deliver high quality direct health care and support services to over half a million people with HIV - more than half of all people with diagnosed HIV in the United States.272 This is one of the many reasons why t he Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is leading key components of the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative . Working within the parameters of the RWHAP statute, funding priorities are guided by stakeholders at local and state lev els, resulting in uniquely structured programs that address their jurisdictions' critical gaps and needs. HRSA also works in partnership with RWHAP recipients at state and local levels to use innovative, evidence informed approaches for community engagemen t, needs assessment, planning processes, policy development, service delivery, clinical quality improvement, and workforce development activities that are needed to support a robust system of HIV care, support and treatment. The RWHAP provides HIV care an d treatment services to a higher proportion of certain populations with HIV than their representation in the epidemic nationally. For example, according to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, 71 percent of people with dia gnosed HIV in the United States are racial and ethnic minorities, while 73 percent of RWHAP clients are racial and ethnic minorities, meeting the target of not being lower than 3 percentage points of the national HIV prevalence data as reported by CDC.273 Similarly, 23 percent of people with diagnosed HIV in the United States are women, while nearly 26 percent of RWHAP clients are women, meeting the target of not being lower than 3 percentage points of the national HIV prevalence data as reported by CDC. The RWHAP is critical to ensuring that individuals with HIV are linked to care, retained in care, able to adhere to medication regimens, and ultimately, achieve viral suppression. These steps are 270 Published December 2021. Health Resources and Services Administration. Ryan White HIV/AIDS Progr am Annual Client -Level Data Report 20 20. -reports . Published December 2021.

According to a study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases , clients receiving care and support at RWHAP -funded facilities are associated with improved outcomes (such as viral suppression), compared to those not served by the RWHAP.280 Furthermore, RWHAP patients are more likely to reach viral suppression regardless of other health care coverage (e.g., uninsured, Medicaid, Medicare, or private insurance). Not only do improved viral suppression rates reduce the transmission of HIV, they also result in significant cost -savings to the health care system.281 The RWHAP has made tremendous progress toward ending the HIV epidemic in the United States: from 2010 to 2020, HIV viral suppression among RWHAP patients has increased from 69.5 percent to 89.4 percent, and racial and ethnic, age -based, and regional disparities have decreased. 282 However, even with these positive outcomes, fully addressing the HIV epidemic domestically continues to be a challenge as the CDC estimates that 1.2 million people in the 274 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

CARES Act funding supports RWHAP Parts A -D and Part F AIDS Education and Training Center (AETC) Program recipients to prepare for, prevent, and respond to the COVID -19 pandemic. HRSA continues to closely monitor the impact of COVID -19 on the RWHAP. Using FY 2020 CARES Act funds, providers tested 87,000 RWHAP -eligible clients and immediate household members for COVID -19, and provided services to over 18,000 people. RWHAP providers quickly pivoted to find ways to safely serve people w ith HIV, such as extending prescription refills from 30 days to 90 days and creating accessible telehealth services for medical care, mental health and substance use disorder services. Early data show that telehealth capacity grew due to FY 2020 CARES Act funding, with the number of RWHAP sites providing telehealth services doubling in 2020 to over 70 percent. 285 The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, Division M, \u00a7 307 included language which allowed flexibilities related to penalties and administrative requirements that the Secretary could exercise to provide relief to RWHAP recipients. HRSA responded by providing opportunities to reduce or delay requirements without compromising the integrity, scope, and implementation of the RWHAP. Given the on-going nature of the pandemic, the Budget proposes to extend this language in FY 2023 to allow continued flexibilities. Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. The Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) initiative, aims to reduce new HIV infections to less than 3,000 per year by 2030. The multi -year EHE initiative initially focuses on 48 counties, Washington, D.C., San Juan (PR), as well as 7 states that have a substantial rural HIV burden. The initiative will continue to bring the additional expertise, technology, and resources needed to end the HIV epidemic in the United States. In spite of EHE funding beginning at the height of the COVID -19 pandemic, HRSA EHE -funded service providers served nearly 19,500 clients (8% higher than the FY 2020 goal) who were new or re-engaged in HIV care and treatment during March 2020 through December 2020. 283 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Jurisdictions will utilize their existing RWHAP infrastructure to implement effective and innovative strategies, interventions, approaches, and services to reduce new HIV infections in the United S tates. Key strategies include: Implementing evidence -informed and emerging strategies shown to increase linkage, engagement, and retention in care targeted to those not yet diagnosed, those diagnosed but not in HIV care, and those who are in HIV care but not yet virally suppressed; Developing new partnerships and models of care to reach those people with HIV; Providing technical assistance and systems coordination to support effective strategic plans and activities to successfully implement the new init iative; and Expanding workforce capacity through the efforts of the Part F AIDS Education and Training Center (AETC) Program. The RWHAP's comprehensive system of HIV care and support services and effective system for medication delivery creates a very eff icient and effective service delivery mechanism for this initiative. Additional Priorities and Collaborative Efforts In FY 2023, the RWHAP will continue to ensure effective use of resources and a coordinated and focused public health response to HIV. RWHA P will also continue to coordinate and collaborate with other federal, state, and local entities as well as national HIV organizations to further leverage and promote efforts to address the unmet care and treatment needs of people with HIV who are uninsured and underserved. These efforts help to align priorities, policies, and activities in sustaining a multi-faceted and comprehensive federal response to the HIV epidemic. Federal partners include the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Indian Health Service (IHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Ag ency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as other HRSA -funded programs, such as the Health Center Program. With many clients in common, RWHAP will also coordinate with the Administration for Community Living (ACL) to leverage existing resources in both programs to advance the health outcomes of older adults living with HIV.

Washington, DC. 276 and strategies to prevent new infections, improve HIV -related health outcomes for people with HIV, reduce HIV -related disparities and health inequities, and achieve integrated and coordinated efforts that address the HIV epidemic among all partners and st akeholders to achieve the bold targets for ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. The RWHAP will continue to coordinate with other federal partners, grant recipients, and other partners to work towards achieving these four goals. The RWHAP is developing a coordinated response to produce an implementation response that outlines the specific actions that the agency will take to achieve the goals and objectives that are outlined in NHAS and accelerate our efforts toward ending the HIV epidemic. The RWH AP will also coordinate with federal partners, grant recipients, and other partners to address the syndemics of HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, and substance use disorders through the following HHS efforts: Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) National Strategic Plan for the United States: A Roadmap to Elimination 2021-2025: The STI plan will develop, enhance and expand STI prevention and care programs over the next five years. The aim is to reverse the recent dramatic rise in STIs in the United States. The STI Plan includes a set of goals, objectives, and strategies to respond to this STI epidemic and includes indicators with measurable targets to track progress. Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan for the United States: A Roadmap to Elimination 2021-2025: The Viral Hepatitis Plan is intended to serve as a comprehensive, data-driven roadmap for federal and other stakeholders to reverse the rates of viral hepatitis, prevent new infections, improve care and treatment and ultimately eliminate viral hepatiti s as a public health threat in the United States. Substance Use Disorder/Opioid Epidemic: In support of HHS's efforts to lead a national response to the opioid crisis, HRSA will continue to work collaboratively with other federal partners to address opioi d use disorder screening, treatment, and support for people with HIV. Reauthorization The Administration looks forward to working with Congress, along with a broad public engagement process, to reauthorize the RWHAP to ensure that the allocation of federal funds address the changing landscape of HIV across the United States. The FY 2023 Budget Request notes the following proposed statutory change which should be included in any RWHAP authorization, which will also help support the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative : Zip Code Information: The proposed changes would modify the restriction on submission or collection of individually identifiable health information to allow the collection and submission of ZIP codes for RWHAP patient residential addresses. I t would also update terminology to ensure consistency with HIPAA. This change would continue to protect patient privacy. The restriction on collection of residential ZIP codes from RWHAP program participants limits the ability to understand geographic dis tribution of patient demographics as well as outcomes and service utilization. It also limits the ability to track and describe patient engagement in the program over time (years), understand the impact of the RWHAP by geographic location, including urban and rural differences, and display 277 RWHAP patient data in alignment with CDC HIV surveillance data to determine shifts and trends. This change will also allow for a more refined approach to addressing HIV health disparities to improve HIV health outcomes. There will be no increased data collection burden, but there will be slight changes to data submission files, which must be maintained in accordance with applicable privacy protections. Measuring Future Performance Together, in FY 2023 RWHAP Parts A -D pr ograms are anticipated to achieve the following performance goals: In FY 2023, the RWHAP will serve racial and ethnic minorities at a proportion not lower than three percentage points of national HIV prevalence data as reported by CDC. In FY 2023, the RW HAP will serve women at a proportion that is not lower than three percentage points of national HIV prevalence data as reported by CDC. In FY 2023, at least 84 percent of all patients receiving HIV medical care and at least one viral load test will be virally suppressed. Additional RWHAP Part -specific performance targets are in the sections that follow.

These jurisdictions are funded as either an Eligible Metropolitan Area (EMA) or a Transitional Grant Area (TGA), depending on the severity of the epidemic in their jurisdiction. Over 71 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV reside in a RWHAP Part A EMA or TGA. 287,288 Formula and supplemental grants directly support the HHS goals to protect and strength equitable access to high quality and affordable healthcare. These grants assist eligible areas in developing and enhancing access to a comprehensive continuum of high quality, community- based care for low -income people with HIV. The RWHAP requires EMAs and TGAs to utilize local needs assessments and p lanning processes to develop coordinated systems of HIV care in order to improve health outcomes for low -income people with HIV, thereby reducing transmission of HIV. RWHAP Part A prioritizes primary medical care, access to antiretroviral treatment, and other core medical and supportive services in order to engage and retain people with HIV in care. These grants fund systems of care to provide services for people with HIV in 24 EMAs and 28 TGAs. EMAs are jurisdictions with 2,000 or more AIDS cases over the last five years, whereas TGAs are jurisdictions with at least 1,000 but fewer than 2,000 AIDS cases over the last five 287 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

HIV /AIDS data through December 2019 provided for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, for fiscal year 2021. 279 years as reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two-thirds of the funds available for EMAs and TGAs are awarded according to a formula, based on the number of people with diagnosed HIV in the EMAs and TGAs. The remaining funds are awarded as discretionary supplemental grants based on the demonstration of additional need by the eligible EMAs and TGAs, and as Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) grants. The MAI funds are a statutory set -aside funding component for RWHAP Parts A - D, and Part F AIDS Education and Training Center Program to evaluate and address the disproportionate impact of HIV on, and the disparities in acce ss, treatment, care, and outcomes for, racial and ethnic minorities . MAI funds are also awarded based on a formula utilizing the number of minorities with diagnosed HIV and AIDS in a jurisdiction and support HIV care, treatment, and support services to racial and ethnic minorities. The RWHAP Part A funds are awarded to the Chief Elected Official who is required to establish a local Planning Council/Body that determines the allocation of RWHAP resources based on local needs assessments. Seventy-five percent of RWHAP Part A service funds must be used to support core medical services . Eligible sub -recipients are community health centers, health departments, ambulatory care facilities, and other non-profit organizations providing services for people with HIV. In 2020, nearly 78 percent of RWHAP Part A clients were racial and ethnic minorities and 25 percent were women. In 2020, RWHAP Part A funded sites provided nearly 3.3 million core medical service visits for health -related care utilizing a combination of RWHA P Parts A, B, C, and D funding. The number of visits for health-related services demonstrates the scope of increasing the availability and accessibility of care. Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. - RWHAP Part A Jurisdictions Thirty -nine of the RWHAP Part A jurisdictions received a cooperative agreement to implement Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative activities related to Pillar Two (Treat) and Pillar Four (Respond) in FY 2021. This initiative is now in its third year and j urisdict ions will utilize t heir existing infrastructure to implement effective and innovative strategies, interventions, approaches, and services to reduce new HIV infections in the United States. See the EHE initiative for more information. 280 RWHAP Part A Funding History289 FY Amount FY $665,876,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part A of $665.9 million is $10.0 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. The FY 2023 President's Budget request will supp ort the provision of core medical and support services for people with HIV in the 24 EMAs and 28 TGAs. The RWHAP has seen a significant increase in utilization during the COVID -19 pandemic due to people with HIV losing other sources of health coverage (such as employer insurance), and state governments' revenue dropping, resulting in state funding cuts. Due to this, the Budget includes $10.0 million for the RWHAP Part A to expand services for significantly impacted populations, particularly racial and ethn ic minorities. RWHAP Part A jurisdictions encompass over 70 percent of all HIV cases in the US, therefore this increase in funding will help meet this need driven by the pandemic. RWHAP Part A jurisdictions are experienced in data-driven, community-based needs assessment, responsive procurement of a variety of direct medical and supportive services, working across service providers to develop and maintain a system of services, and serving diverse populations. In 2020, 66 percent of all RWHAP clients were served by one of the 52 metropolitan areas funded under the RWHAP Part A, an increase of nearly one percent from the previous year. Over 70 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV reside within these metropolitan areas. The RWHAP serves populations that ar e diverse with multiple structural barriers to care (e.g., people with HIV at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level and/or those who are homeless). The FY 2023 funding request will support the RWHAP Part A in achieving its target of providing 3.3 million core medical service visits for health -related care. RWHAP Part A funding 289 EHE funding is not included in this table. 281 will also contribute to achieving the FY 2023 targets for performance goals that relate to cross - cutting activities, such as the percentage of racial and ethnic minoriti es and women served, percentage of clients who achieved viral suppression, and percentage of HIV -positive pregnant women served by RWHAP who receive antiretroviral medications. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs.

RWHAP Part B grants directly support the HHS goal to protect and strengthen equitable access to high quality and affordable healthcare, including efforts to reduce costs and ensure access to medications. These grants support outpatient ambulatory medical care, HIV -related prescription medications, case management, oral health care, health insurance premium and cost -sharing assistance, mental health and substance abuse services, and support services. RWHAP Part B funds are distributed through base and supplemental grants, AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) base and ADAP supplemental grants, Emerging Communities (ECs) grants, and Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) grants . The base awards are distributed by a formula based on a state or territory's prevalent HIV cases weighted for cases outside of the jurisdictions that receive RWHAP Part A funding. The ECs are metropolitan areas that do not qualify as RWHAP Part A EMAs or TGAs but have 500-999 cumulative reported AIDS cases over the last five years. States apply on behalf of the ECs for funding through the RWHAP Part B base grant application. RWHAP Part B supplemental grants are av ailable through a competitive process to eligible states with demonstrated need. A portion of the RWHAP Part B appropriation supports ADAP, which supports the provision of HIV medications and related services, including health insurance premium and cost -sharing assistance. These funds are distributed by a formula based on prevalent HIV cases. In addition, ADAP supplemental funds are a five percent set aside for states with severe need. ADAP provides FDA -approved prescription medications for people with HI V who cannot afford HIV medications. ADAP is instrumental in efforts to end the HIV epidemic across the nation. ADAP 285 provides the access to medications and insurance necessary for people with HIV to achieve optimal health outcomes and viral suppression. Individual ADAPs operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The MAI funds are a statutory set -aside funding component for RWHAP Parts A - D and Part F AIDS Education and Training Center Program to evaluate and address the disproportionate impact of HIV on, and the disparities in access, treatment, care, and outcomes for, racial and ethnic minorities. The RWHAP Part B MAI funding is statutorily required to specifically support education and outreach services to increase the number of eligible racial and ethnic minorities who have access to the RWHAP ADAP. Of all the clients served by the RWHAP Part B program in 2020, nearly 70 percent were racial and/ethnic minorities, and 25 percent were women. Per statute, 75 percent of RWHAP Part B service funds must be used to support core medical service s and in 2020, RWHAP Part B funded sites provided 2.2 million core medical service visits for health-related care utilizing RWHAP Parts A, B, C, and D funding. The number of visits for health-related services demonstrates the scope of RWHAP Part B in delivering primary care and related services for people with HIV by increasing the availability and accessibility of care. Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. - States Seven RWHAP Part B recipients with a substantial rural burden of new HIV diagnoses and the state of Ohio (on behalf of Hamilton County, which is currently not part of an EMA/TGA), received a cooperative agreement to implement Ending HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative activities related to Pillar Two (Treat) and Pillar Four (Respond) in FY 2021. This initiative is now in its third year and j urisdictions will continue to utilize their existing infrastructure to implement effective and innovative strategies, interventions, approaches, and services to reduce new HIV infections in the United States. See th e EHE initiative section for more information. AIDS Drug Assistance Program The RWHAP Part B has been successful in helping to ensure that people with HIV have access to the care and treatment services they need to live longer, healthier lives. According to the RWHAP ADAP Report, ADAPs, which are run by states and territories, continue to provide robust formularies of antiretroviral medications to treat HIV infection, prevent and treat opportunistic infections, manage side effects, and treat co-morbidit ie s. Recent studies have demonstrated that individuals with HIV on antiretroviral medications who achieve viral suppression are not at risk to transmit HIV to others. The RWHAP provides the care and treatment services that support the achievement of viral su ppression and therefore, has a significant public health impact on HIV incidence as well. These efforts demonstrate the central role of the RWHAP in ending the HIV epidemic by ensuring that people with HIV have access to regular care, are started on, and adhere to, their antiretroviral medications. According to the RWHAP ADAP data, the number of people with HIV receiving ADAP services has grown 44 percent over the last ten years from 208,809 clients in 2010, to 300,785 clients in 2020, exceeding the FY 2020 target by 34,785. In FY 2020, the RWHAP ADAP provided medication and health care coverage assistance for nearly 29 percent of people diagnosed with 286 HIV in the United States and 70 percent of all clients served by ADAPs were racial and ethnic minorities. Of all the ADAP clients served nationwide, 72 percent had incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. ADAP Cost Containment: Increased demand for RWHAP ADAP services has led States to implement cost -containment strategies for their ADAP s. Cost -containment measures include using drug-purchasing strategies such as cost recovery through drug rebates and third party billing and direct ly negotiati ng pharmaceutical pricing. In addition, states have implemented cost-savings strategies such as recovering costs when another payor was primary, coordinating benefits with Medicare Part D, and improving drug-purchasing models. ADAPs have reported significant savings by participating in the 340B program, manufacturer rebate programs and recovering cost s through insurance reimbursement. Across the RWHAP, grant recipients are encouraged to maximize resources and leverage efficiencies. One example of this is within RWHAP Part B, where ADAPs use a variety of the above -mentioned strategies to maximize resou rces, which result in effective funds management, enabling ADAPs to serve more people. In 2020, ADAPs participating in cost -savings strategies on medications saved $2.5 billion, falling slightly under the FY 2020 performance target of $2.6 billion. Over the last 5 years, ADAPs participating in medication cost -savings strategies saved $9.4 billion. Elimination of ADAP Waiting Lists: Because of investments in RWHAP Part B, ADAP and the increased technical assistance activities for cost -containment measures, ADAP waiting lists decreased from a peak of 9,310 in September 2011, to zero in August 2015. Since FY 2010, HHS has taken several actions to stabilize the ADAP, including using emergency authority to target States with waiting lists or potential waiting lists, and to implement cost containment and cost savings measures. In FY 2023, HRSA will continue the use of RWHAP ADAP Emergency Relief Funds (ERF) through \"311 authority\" in order to maintain infrastructure in the states and territories that had previous ly imposed waiting lists and to mitigate the risk of the establishment new wait lists. This is particularly important as public health efforts diagnose more people with HIV and engage people who are out of HIV care and treatment, increasing the number of patients in care. This funding also addresses the gaps in access created by ongoing cost -containment measures in many ADAPs such as HIV medication formulary reductions, lower client financial eligibility levels, and capped enrollment. However, with no individuals on the ADAP waiting lists, states requested and HRSA distributed $75 million in ERF funding in FY 2021. These funds are required to be used for ADAP services, including the purchase of medications, insurance premium assistance, and medication copay assistance. States that developed need through unforeseen events also have the ability to request RWHAP Part B supplemental funds to assist in meeting shortfalls. HRSA continues to closely monitor the impact of COVID -19 on the ADAPs as they anecdotally rep ort an increase in client applications due to the loss of employment and/or health care coverage. The RWHAP ADAP plays a crucial role that ensures access to HIV medications for pregnant women. Due to availability of effective HIV medications , mother -to-child transmission in the United States has decreased dramatically since its peak in 1992 due to 1) an increased focus on 287 HIV testing for all pregnant women; and 2) the use of antiretroviral therapy, which significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission from the mother to her baby. In 2020, 99 percent of HIV - positive pregnant women served by the RWHAP were prescribed antiretroviral therapy to prevent maternal -to-child transmission of HIV, exceeding the FY 2020 performance target by 3 percentage points. Funding History291 Amount Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part B of $1.3 billion is $30.0 million above FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. The FY 2023 President's Budget request will support the provi sion of core medical and support services for people with HIV in the 24 EMAs and 28 TGAs. These levels include $900.3 million for RWHAP ADAPs to provide access to life saving HIV related medications and direct health care services to people with HIV in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and five Associated Pacific Jurisdictions. HRSA will continue to utilize the 311 authority to implement the Emergency Relief Fund to prevent, reduce, or eliminate ADAP waiting lis ts through cost containment and/or cost savings measures. The RWHAP Part B ADAP program has seen a significant increase in utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to people with HIV losing other sources of health coverage (such as employer insurance) and state government revenue dropping, resulting in state funding cuts. Due to this, the Budget includes $30.0 million for the RWHAP Part B program base to meet this greater need. By increasing the RWHAP Part B program base, states will have the greatest flexibility in utilizing the funds, whether for ADAP or for other critical services. Additionally, a portion of the additional funding will be directed by statute to the RWHAP Part B supplemental, which will be available to states with the highest unmet ne eds. 291 EHE funding is not included in this table. 288 As part of the program's efforts to continue to provide access to life -saving medications and related services for low -income people with HIV, the RWHAP has established a target for FY 2023 of serving at least 285,000 RWHAP ADAP clients. This targ et is based on anticipated steady funding, not on demand. While the number of ADAP clients is projected to remain constant in future years with anticipated steady funding, health care coverage and costs related to co-pays, co-insurance, premiums, etc., ar e difficult to anticipate. The increased demand for ADAP services in recent years has required many states to r ecover costs when possible by coordinating benefits with Medicare Part D or exhausting all coverage options, participating in rebate programs, an d improving drug-purchasing models. An important contributing factor to the demand for services for RWHAP ADAP continues to be access to HIV medications and high cost -sharing requirements for these medications for patients with many types of health cover age plans. In order to meet this demand, the number of ADAPs participating in cost -savings strategies on medications will need to remain steady (the FY 2023 target is to maintain the previous year's output measure). RWHAP Part B grant recipients will conti nue to work directly with uninsured people with HIV to ensure access to health care coverage and will continue to support HIV medications not on health plan formularies and the cost sharing required by health coverage plans. ADAP resources will also suppor t the continued: increase in RWHAP clients as more people with HIV are diagnosed, linked to care, and retained in care; increase in RWHAP growth as more people enter the health care system with coverage who require assistance with insurance premiums and cost-sharing; and, need for medication and/or health care coverage assistance for clients who remain uninsured. HRSA and the CDC continue to collaborate to accelerate the elimination of perinatal HIV transmission in the United States. The FY 2023 funding request will support RWHAP ADAP to ensure that at least 9 7% of HIV -positive pregnant women served by the RWHAP will receive antiretroviral medications. RWHAP Part B funding will also contribute to achieving the FY 2023 targets for performance goals that related to cross -cutting activities, such as the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities and women served, and percentage of clients who achieved viral suppression. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process , follow -up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs. 289 Outcomes and Outputs Table Me asure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2022 Targe care.

RWHAP Part C supports comprehensive primary health care and support services in an outpatient setting for low -income, uninsured, and underserved people with HIV. Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) funds are a statutory set -aside funding component for RWHAP Parts A - D, and Part F AIDS Education and Training Center Program to evaluate and address the disproportionate impact of HIV on, racial and ethnic minorities. RWHAP Part C MAI funding supports HIV care, treatment, and support services to racial and ethnic minorities. RWHAP Part C is also authorized to fund capacity development grants that strengthen organizational development and infrastructure, resulting in a more effective delivery of HIV care and services. The RWHAP Part C provides services for people with HIV disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic and who have poor health outcomes, including ethnic and minority populations and youth. In 2020, RWHAP Part C funded sites served over 330,000 clients utilizing a combination of RWHAP Parts A, B, C, and D funding. Of the total clients served, 73 percent were racial and ethnic minorities and 25 percent were female. The RWHAP has a history of creat ing effective patient -centered services that support strong provider and patient relationships. Providers funded through RWHAP Part C have the clinical expertise and cultural competency to provide quality care and treatment to low -income, diverse people wi th HIV. In 2020, RWHAP Part C funded sites provided nearly 2.3 million medical service visits for health -related care utilizing a combination of RWHAP Parts A, B, C, and D funding. The number of visits for health-related services demonstrates the scope of RWHAP Part 293 C in delivering primary care and related services for people with HIV by increasing the availability and accessibility of care. Funding His tory Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part C of $207.1 million is $6.0 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. This funding will support comprehensive medical, treatment and support services necessary to achieve improved health outcomes, such as improved viral suppression rates, essential to ending the HIV epidemic. The RWHAP has seen a significant increase in utilization during the COVID -19 pandemic as people with HIV have lost other sources of health coverage (such as employer insurance) and state governments' revenue has dropped, resulting in state funding cuts. Due to this, the Budget includes $6.0 million for new RWHAP Part C community based clinics in areas of the country with the greatest need. RWHAP Part C supports direct health care servi ces for low -income people with HIV who are uninsured or underserved. These services are considered essential to improving health outcomes and are a crucial part of the care network that links and retains people with HIV into health care. Such critical heal th care services include intensive case management and care coordination services, linking and retaining people with HIV into care, and getting them on antiretroviral medications as early as possible. The funding request will support the RWHAP Part C in achieving its target of providing 2.2 million visits for health -related care in FY 202 3. RWHAP Part C funding will also contribute to achieving the FY 2023 targets for performance goals that relate to cross -cutting activities, such as percentage of racial and ethnic minorities and women served, percentage of clients who 294 Reflects Ryan White B udget Authority only (does not include $5.089 million in Health Center Program B udget Authority for RWH AP Part C grant recipients in FY 2012).

Minority AIDS Initiative Funds (MAI) funds are a statutory set -aside funding component for RWHAP Parts A - D, and Part F AIDS Education and Training Center Program to evaluate and address the disproportionate impact of HIV on, and the disparities in access, treatment, care, and outcomes for, racial and ethnic minorities. RWHAP Part D MAI funding supports HIV care, treatment, and support ser vices to racial and ethnic minorities. In 2020, RWHAP Part D funded sites provided nearly 1.6 million visits for health-related care and support services utilizing a combination of RWHAP Parts A, B, C, and D funding. The RWHAP Part D serves women, infant, children, and youth - populations disproportionately affected by HIV epidemic that have poor health outcomes. In 2020, RWHAP Part D funded sites 295 Support services are available for family members who do not have HIV . Some ex amples are family -centered case management, childcare services during medical appointment attendance, and psychosocial support service s that focus on equipping affected family members, and caregivers, to manage the stress associated with HIV. 296 served 213,152 clients utilizing a combination of RWHAP Parts A, B, C, and D funding. Of the total clients serv ed, 75 percent were racial and ethnic minorities and 28 percent were female. RWHAP Part D providers have the clinical expertise and cultural competency to provide quality care and treatment to low -income, diverse women, infant, children, and youth with H IV. Funding History FY Amount FY 2012 FY $75,088,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part D of $75.1 million is equal to the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. These funding levels will support compre hensive the comprehensive array of medical and supports services necessary to achieve improved health outcomes, such as improved viral suppression rates, essential to ending the HIV epidemic. RWHAP Part D supports health care services for low -income people with HIV who are uninsured or underserved. These services are considered essential to improving health outcomes and are a crucial part of the care network that links and retains people with HIV into health care, especially for women, infants and children and youth. Such critical health care services include intensive case management and care coordination services, linking and retaining people with HIV into care, and getting them on antiretroviral medications as early as possible. The funding request will support the RWHAP Part D in achieving its target of providing 1.6 million visits for health -related care in FY 202 3. RWHAP Part D funding will contribute to achieving the FY 2023 targets for performance goals that relate to cross -cutting activities, such as the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities and women served, percentage of clients who achieved viral suppression, and percentage of pregnant women with HIV served by the RWHAP who receive antiretroviral medications.

The RWHAP AETC improves the quality of life of people with or at - risk of HIV through the provision of specialized professional education and training. The program uses a strategy of implementation of multidisciplinary education and training programs for health care providers in the prevention and treatment of HIV, bolstering the health workforce to ensure delivery of quality services and care for underserved populations . The RWHAP AET C Program targets training to health care providers who serve minority populations, the homeless, rural communities, incarcerated persons, federally qualified community and migrant health centers, and RWHAP sites. In addition, over half the providers thems elves are racial and ethnic minorities , exceeding the target by six percent . AETC -trained health care providers are trained to offer innovative and culturally- and linguistically-appropriate healthcare services and empowers underserved populations with choices. This directly supports the HHS goal to protect and strengthen equitable access to high quality and affordable healthcare. The RWHAP AETC Program trains providers through a variety of training modalities, including didactics, clinical preceptorships , self -study, clinical consultation, communities of practice and distance -based technologies. A variety of educational formats are used including skills building workshops, hands -on preceptorships and mini -residencies, on-site training, tele -education, and technical assistance. For example, the RWHAP AETC implemented an online interactive platform that hosts an HIV care and treatment curriculum targeted to health care professionals. 299 Clinical faculty also provides timely clinical consultation in person or via the telephone or internet. Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. - AETC Program Eleven RWHAP AETC Program recipients received funding through the Ending HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative to expand workforce capacity by offering training and technical assistance to health care providers and paraprofessionals in FY 2021. This initiative is now in its third year and jurisdictions will utilize their existing infrastructure to implement effective and innovative strategies, interventions, approaches, and services to reduce new HIV infections in the United States. See the EHE initiative section for more information.

These funding levels will support targeted, multidisciplinary education and training programs for novice and experienced health care providers treating people with HIV in order to assure acces s to high quality HIV care delivered by competent providers. The RWHAP AETC program also provides expert advice to providers across the country on HIV treatment, pre -exposure prophylaxis to reduce HIV transmission, substance use disorders, viral hepatitis co-infection, post -exposure prophylaxis, and the treatment of pregnant women with HIV and their newborns to prevent mother -to-child transmission. The RWHAP AETC program funds a National HIV Curriculum e -Learning Platform for medical providers on HIV care and treatment to assure continued training of providers from medical/nursing school through in-service training. The central focus of RWHAP AETC training is to ensure high quality care and good patient outcomes through HIV care and treatment that is 296 EHE funding is not included in this table. 300 consis tent with established treatment guidelines and reflects current research. This is increasingly important as people with HIV are living longer. In addition, the number of experienced HIV care professionals is projected to decrease as many of those who have worked in the epidemic since its inception reach retirement age. Training an expanded cadre of culturally competent, high quality providers is vital to increasing access to quality HIV care and treatment and improving health outcomes for people with HIV. HRSA will continue to prioritize interactive training and technical assistance that result in health system strengthening and transformation. Focus will be on training health care providers, particularly racial and ethnic minority providers, to deliver hi gh quality HIV care and treatment services in primary care settings - settings that have typically not provided services to people with HIV.

The RWHAP DRP ensures access to oral health care for low -income people with HIV by reimbursing dental education programs for the non-reimbursed costs they incur providing such care. By offsetting the co sts of non-reimbursed HIV care in accredited dental education institutions, the RWHAP DRP improves access to oral health care for low -income, people with HIV and ensures quality services by dental students, dental hygiene students, and dental residents for providing oral health care services to people with HIV. The care provided through the program includes a full range of diagnostic, preventive, and treatment services, including oral surgery, as well as oral health education and health promotion. Dental sc hools, post -doctoral dental education programs, and dental hygiene education programs accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation that have documented non-reimbursed costs for providing oral health care to people with HIV are eligible to apply for reimbursement. Funds are then distributed to eligible organizations taking into account the number of people served and the cost of providing care. In FY 2020, the RWHAP DRP awards were able to provide over 36 percent of the total non- reimbursed costs re quested by 49 participating institutions in support of oral health care. These institutions reported providing care to 17,933 people with HIV (7,036 for whom no other funded source was available), a 33 percent drop from 2019. In 2020, COVID -19 disrupted the delivery of oral health care nationwide - not just within the RWHAP - with nearly half of U.S. adults 302 reported delaying dental care due to the COVID -19 pandemic.297 FY 2020, the demographic characteristics of patients who were cared for by institutions participating in the RWHAP DRP were 64 percent minority and 28 percent women. The RWHAP CBDPP supports collaborations between dental education programs and community-based partners to deliver oral health services in community settings while supporting student s and residents enrolled in accredited dental educations programs. In FY 2020, RWHAP CBDPP funded 12 partnership grants to support collaboration and coordination between the dental education programs and the community-based partners in the delivery of oral health services.

Through its demonstration and implementation projects SPNS evaluates the design, utilization, cost, and health-related outcomes of treatment strategies while promoting the dissemination and replication of successful interventions. This unique program advances knowledge and skills in the delivery of health care and support services to underserved populations. As healthcare systems wor k under increasingly dynamic conditions, evidence -based, evidence - informed, and emerging strategies are essential in order to ensure that research investments maximize healthcare value and improve public health. Implementation science plays a critical role in supporting these efforts. RWHAP SPNS -funded projects use implementation science - the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings into routine practice - to document and capture how well interventions and strategies improve the quality and effectiveness of health services, maximize resources, and improve health outcomes for people with HIV. The RWHAP SPNS evaluates the effectiveness of various models, interventions, strategies, implementation, utilization, cost, and health -related outcomes. Systematic strategies are used to identify emerging strategies among RWHAP recipients and to coordinate, develop tools kits and other modalities that allow for rapid dissemination and uptake. Through these special projects, RWHAP SPNS grant recipients implement a variety of interventions, which contribute to the advancement of public health knowledge and the ultimate goal of ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. Of the 39 FY 2021 RWHAP SPNS grant recipients currently funded, 26 percent are community-based/AIDS services organizations; 8 percent are state/county/local departments of health; 26 305 percent are community health centers; 15 percent are academic-based clinics; 8 percent are public health research/training institute; and 17 percent are universities/evaluation and technical assistance providers. Current SPNS initiatives include: Improving collecting and reporting viral suppression data to the Medicaid adult core set; using innovative intervention strategies to improve health outcomes among people with HIV; leverage a data to care approach to cure hepatitis C within RWHAP; building capacity to implement rapid art start for improved care engagement in RWHAP; developing a compendium of promising rapid antiretroviral therapy start in RWHAP - dissemination assistance provider; improving care and treatment coordination focusing on black women with HIV; building capacity to support innovative program model replication among RWHAP jurisdictions; enhancing linkages of sexually t ransmitted infections (STI) and HIV surveillance data in the RWHAP; strengthening systems of care for people with HIV and opioid use disorder; and implementation of evidence -informed behavioral health models to improve HIV health outcomes for Black Men Who Have Sex With Men. Funding History FY Amount FY 2012 FY Budget $25,000,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part F -SPNS of $25 million is equal to the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. These funding levels will support the continued development of innovative models of HIV care and treatment for populations that are significantly difficult to engage in continuous care and achieve viral suppression. Through its funded demonstration projects, RWHAP SPNS evaluat es the design, implementation, utilization, cost, and health-related outcomes of treatment models, interventions, and strategies, while promoting the dissemination and replication of successful ones. RWHAP SPNS funding also supports projects to build capacity in the health information technology (HIT) systems of RWHAP grant recipients and provider organizations to report client -level data and to improve health outcomes. 306 The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award proc ess, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

The multi -year EHE in itiative currently focuses on 48 counties, Washington, D.C., San Juan (PR), as well as 7 states that have a substantial rural HIV burden (EHE jurisdictions). HRSA's focus is on linking people with HIV who are either newly diagnosed, diagnosed but currentl y not in care, or are diagnosed in care but not yet virally suppressed to the essential HIV care and treatment and support services needed to help them achieve viral suppression. Funding levels for the EHE initiative were informed by modeling by the Cente rs for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that analyzed the impact of specific activities (increased engagement in care and viral suppression, and PrEP services uptake) on priority communities, and costs related to provision of these services. To reach the goals of EHE, HRSA needs to enroll and provide HIV services to183,000 people with HIV by year five. At current funding levels, this will require a focus on building capacity to quickly expand in years four and five Despite the FY 2020 funding reaching grantees in March 2020, at the beginning of the COVID epidemic nationally, HRSA exceeded the FY 2020 goal of serving 18,000 people. EHE jurisdictions funded by HRSA served nearly 19,500 clients (8% more than the FY 2020 goal) who were new or re -engaged i n HIV care and treatment during March 2020 through December 2020. Of the new clients receiving EHE initiative services during 2020, 59% received antiretroviral therapy (ART). In 2021, HRSA expects to serve 27,000 people with HIV through the EHE initiative (include s continued care for 18,000 people from year 1 and 9,000 new and re -engaged people in year 2). In 2022 HRSA expects to continue to serve 27,000 EHE clients. 308 The EHE-funded technical assistance (TA) and systems coordination cooperative agreements will continue to support strategies such as data to care efforts; using acuity tools to identify and provide care for the most challenging patients; developing models such as low -barrier clinics to meet patients where they are; rapid engagement and medicat ion initiation protocols; and others that have been successful in the field. As lessons are learned from the second year, HRSA and the TA entity will work to utilize and disseminate those lessons nationally. The EHE jurisdictions funded by HRSA HAB will continue to work with their respective AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) to ensure necessary resources are available to provide assistance for medications and health care coverage premiums and cost sharing for people newly diagnosed with HIV or re -engage d in care through the EHE initiative. As part of the EHE initiative, the RWHAP Part F AIDS Education and Training Center (AETC) Program will continue to expand workforce capacity by providing training and technical assistance to health care providers and paraprofessionals. This will include activities such as training health care providers on HIV medical care and treatment and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) service delivery; working with clinics and health care providers to develop culturally competent s ettings and approaches to the populations reached through the EHE initiative; and providing technical assistance on practice transformation in clinics to increase HIV testing, linkage to care, rapid antiretroviral therapy delivery, and improved viral suppr ession . HRSA -funded EHE jurisdictions made significant progress toward implementing the EHE work plans in spite of the COVID -19 pandemic. This progress included developing administrative infrastructure and service delivery infrastructure, engaging with community members and new partners, and delivering services to clients. HRSA continues to monitor the impact of COVID -19 on the RWHAP and is working to more fully understand the impact the pandemic is having on the EHE initiative. Funding History FY Amount FY 2013 --- FY 2014 --- FY 2015 --- FY 2016 --- FY 2017 --- $290,000,000 309 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) initiative is $290.0 million. This request will support HIV care and treatment in the 48 counties, DC, San Juan (PR), and seven states that contain more than 50% of new HIV infections. HRSA estimates that 76,000 clients will be served by EHE recipients through FY 2023, an increase of 49,000 clients from the FY 2022 estimates. The increase from FY 2022 to FY 2023 will represent a significant expansion in the EHE initiative. 299 In FY 2023, HRSA will continue to direct EHE funding to the current 39 RWHAP Part A jurisdictions that contain one or more of the counties and the current eight RWHAP Part B states (including funding to the state of Ohio for Hamilton County, which is not a RWHAP Part A). HRSA requires coordination with the respective AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAPs) to ensure necessary resources are available to provide assistance for medications and health care coverage premiums and cost sharing for people newly diagnosed with HIV or re -engaged in care through the initiative. The RWHAP's comprehensive system of HIV care and support services and effective system for medication delivery creates a very efficient and effective service delivery mechanism for this initiative. The FY 2023 request of $290.0 million wil l support HIV care and treatment needs for an estimated 76,000 - this includes 27,000 people from year 3 and 49,000 newly identified and re -engaged people in year 4, who prior to the start of the initiative were not in care. This will allow HRSA to continue efforts to engage people who are newly diagnosed and maintain the HIV care and treatment for those who were reengaged and newly diagnosed in the first three years of the initiative. As more people with HIV receive HIV care and treatment, the initiative f unding will be critical for keeping an increasing number of patients on medications to prevent HIV transmissions and improve HIV health outcomes. HRSA will fund the AETC Program to provide training and technical assistance to health care providers, clinics , and paraprofessionals as well as health departments to increase HIV testing, care and treatment, the provision of PrEP services, and retention in care. HRSA will continue to direct funding to support technical assistance and systems coordination to enhance the current Bureau Reporting Systems (BRS) to provide timely monitoring of the EHE initiative; to support dissemination of effective interventions to increase the number of people with HIV served by the initiative; to provide additional technical assistance to jurisdictions to implement models of care that work to identify and link and retain the key populations for the EHE initiative. 299 Details on the PrEP Delivery Program to End the HIV Epidemic are included in Mandatory Proposals sectio n of the Departmental Management Congressional Justification. 310 Outcomes and Outputs Table Me asure Year and Most Recent Result / Targe t for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2 022 Targe 4060.01 Number of new clients served through the EHE initiative (Output) 300 FY 2021: Results expected April 30, 2022 50,000 76,000 + 26,000 4060.02 Viral suppression among new clients served by the EHE initiative ( Outcome) [1] FY 2021: Results expected April 30, 2022 Not Defined Not Defined Not Defined Grants Awards Table The table below includes the awards to jurisdictions only (47 total): Grant Awards FY 2021 Final FY 2022 Continuing Resolution FY 2023 Pre s ident's Budget Number of Jurisdiction Awards 47 47 47 Ave rage Award $1,861,166 Unavailable Unavailable Range of Awards $1,000,000 - $10,900,000 Unavailable Unavailable 300 The first target is 18,200 new clients in FY 2020, for FY 2021, the estimated number of clients served is now 27,000 people with HIV , based on amount of funds appropriated.

Expired Allocation Method: Contracts Competitive Grants/Co-operative Agreements Other (Interagency Support) Program De scription The Organ Transplantation Program extends and enhances the lives of individuals with end-stage organ failure for whom an organ transplant is the most appropriate therapeutic treatment. HRSA oversees a national system, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), to allocate and distribute donor organs to indi viduals waiting for transplants. Organ allocation is guided by OPTN policies informed by analytical support from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). HRSA funds the Living Organ Donation Reimbursement Program (formerly Reimbursement o f Travel and Subsistence Expenses toward Living Organ Donation Program) to provide financial assistance to eligible living organ donors. HRSA also invests in public education and outreach to increase the number of registered organ donors, increase the sup ply of deceased donor organs for transplantation, and ensure living organ donors' safety. The OPTN is a critical system that facilitates matching donor organs to transplant candidates. Given the high demand for and limited supply of organs, OPTN policies are under continual review and refinement to achieve the best outcomes for patients, attain the maximum benefit for the maximum number of waitlist candidates, make the best use of donor organs, and align with policy requirements of the OPTN final rule (42 CFR 121). OPTN operating costs are covered by appropriated funds and revenues generated by registration fees paid by transplant centers for each transplant candidate placed on the waiting list. The OPTN collects fees under the authority of 42 CFR \u00a7121.5( c). The OPTN final rule (42 CFR \u00a7121.12) established the Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation (ACOT), which is composed of experts in organ transplantation, to provide 314 recommendations to the Secretary on issues related to organ donation and transpla ntation. HRSA provides logistics and analytical support for periodic ACOT meetings. HRSA also engages in interagency activities that support organ donation and transplantation. The SRTR provides analytical support to the OPTN in the development of organ allocation policies and performance evaluation. Additionally, the SRTR provides analytical support to HHS, including the ACOT. SRTR shares information publicly about the performance of transplant programs and organ procurement organizations at https://ww w.srtr.org/. It publishes online transplant program risk-adjusted patient and graft outcomes data and organ procurement organization risk-adjusted data on organs procured per donor. SRTR also publishes a comprehensive Annual Data Report that includes the most current ten years of data on waitlist, transplant, and deceased donor organ donation. HRSA collaborates with the organ donation and transplantation community to promote awareness of the need for donated organs and to encourage public enrollment on or gan donor registries (state or national). Outreach activities include: Public service announcement campaigns for radio, TV, and publications nationwide Educational web videos for reposting, download, and social media Radio Ad Spotlights during high traf fic drive -time hours in designated markets with the highest numbers of African Americans, Asians, Hispanics or Latinos, and people 50 years and older. Data reveals gaps between the numbers of patients waiting for an organ and the number of donors from the se groups Organ donation and transplantation related articles for newspapers and journals HRSA's organ donation sites: www.organdonor.gov and https:// donaciondeorganos.go v Grant projects to test approaches to promote public awareness of the need for organ donation and increase donor registration In September 2020, HRSA increased the income eligibility threshold for the Living Organ Donation Reimbursement Program from 300 to 350 percent of the HHS Poverty Guidelines. The Program also expanded the qualified reimbursable expenses to include lost wages and dependent care expenses (childcare and eldercare). The changes aim to increase the number of kidney transplants from living donors and decrease recipient waiting times. Program Accomplishments Deceased organ donation and transplantation reached annual record numbers in 2020 and 2021. Living organ donation declined from March to May 2020, as living organ donation was deferr ed temporarily to avoid exposing potential living organ donors and recipients to COVID -19. Beginning in June 2020, living donation and transplantation returned to rates more similar to those seen pre -pandemic, but the overall number of living donors and transplants performed from living donor organs in 2020 (5,726) and 2021 (6,541) was less than in 2019 (7,397). The Living Organ Donation Reimbursement Program exceeded its monthly goals throughout 2021, processing more than 1,552 applications in 2021 compared to 852 in 2020. One of HRSA's primary goals for the Organ Transplantation Program is to increase the annual number of transplants using deceased donor organs. The organ procurement and transplantation 315 community has achieved increased annual numbers of deceased donor organs procured, and organ transplants performed year after year since 2015. The number of deceased donor organs transplanted in CY 2021 was 38,098, a 4.25 percent increase over the CY 2020 total of 36,544. Another important program goa l is to increase the deceased organ donor conversion rate, which is the rate potential organ donors become actual organ donors after death. The conversion rate has been a key performance metric and a priority for the Organ Transplantation Program since 2003. The conversion rate has averaged at approximately 71 percent for the last five years, as shown in Table 1. HRSA will continue to monitor conversion rates and determine potential next steps. The organ donor conversion rate is based on \"eligible deaths,\" including potential donors aged 75 or below who are legally declared dead by neurologic criteria (brain death) and not excluded for other defined reasons related to certain risk factors. The number of \"eligible deaths\" does not include: 1) donors declared dead by circulatory determination of death (cardiac death) rather than neurologic criteria; and, 2) donors whose organs were transplanted despite donor age or other risk factors that may have excluded them from being counted as \"eligible deaths.\" Tabl e 1.

HRSA achieves this goal by: 1) providing a national system for recruiting potential bone marrow donors; 2) tissue typing potential marrow donors; 3) building a genetically and ethnically diverse inventory of at least 150,000 new units of high-quality umbilical cord blood units (CBU) for transplantation; 4) coordinating the procurement of bone marrow and umbilical cord blood units for transpl antation; 5) offering patient and donor advocacy services; 6) providing public and professional education; and, 7) collecting, analyzing, and reporting data on transplant outcomes. These activities, which were previously implemented and reported through t wo separate programs, the National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI) Program and the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program (CWBYCTP), were combined in FY 2022. Blood stem cell transplantation, which includes bone marrow and cord blood, is a potentially curative therapy for many individuals with leukemia and other life -threatening blood and genetic disorders. Each year, nearly 18,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with life - threatening illnesses where blood stem cell transplantation from matched donors is the best treatment option. Often, the ideal donor is a suitably matched family member, but only 30 percent of people have a fully matched relative. The other 70 percent, or approximately 12,600 people, often search for a matched unrelated adult donor or umbilical cord blood unit. 302 Public Health Service Act, Sections 379-379B, as amended by P.L. 11 7-15 states that the term 'bone marrow' means the cells found in the adult bone marrow and peripheral blood. 318 The BSCTP operates through four major contractual functions that require close coordination and oversight and supports an Advisory Council that provides recommendations to the HHS Secretary and HRSA on activities related to t he BSCTP. The major functions of the BSCTP are: The combined Single Point of Access - Coordinating Center (SPA -CC) maintains a system for health care professionals and physicians, searching on behalf of patients, to search electronically for cells derived from adult marrow donors and cord blood units through a single point of access and supports coordination activities for bone marrow and cord blood. The Office of Patient Advocacy (OPA) maintains a system for patient advocacy, which provides individualized patient services for ongoing searches for bone marrow donors or cord blood units. The OPA also assists patients with information regarding treatment options and payment matters. The Stem Cell Therapeutic Outcomes Database (SCTOD) provides an electronic blood stem cell transplant outcomes database for researchers and health care professionals. The SCTOD provides related donor transplant pairs from adult and pediatric participating centers in the C. W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program (CWBYCTP) tha t provides a representative sample of U.S. related transplant activity. The Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Program provides funds through competitive contracts for the collection and storage of qualified cord blood units (CBUs) by a network of public umbilical cord blood banks in the U.S. HRSA prioritizes cord blood banks that have biological license agreements (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the demonstrated capability to collect and bank significant numbers of CBUs from genetically and ethnically diverse populations. Program Accomplishments The Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Program continues to serve a diverse patient population, with volunteer adult donors and umbilical cord blood units playing a vital role in expanding transplant access to patients from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations. Increasing the number of blood stem cell transplants facilitated for patients from genetically and ethnically diverse backgrounds addresses the statutory aim of ensuring comparable access to transplantation for patients from all populations. As of the end of FY 2021, more than 23 million potential adult volunteer donors and 116,930 HRSA -funded CBU (see Table 1) were listed on the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program 's reg istry. 319 Table 1. Cord Blood Collections Fiscal Year Number of Units Contracted Cord Blood Units Collected and Made Available303 for Patient Searches Cumulative Units Made Available million adult donors who self -identify as belonging to an underrepresented racial or ethnic population was not met. One of the primary reasons for the unmet goal was the limited in-person recruitment activity during the COVID -19 pandemic. Due to the anticipated ongoing impact of COVID -19, HRSA expects the registry will add 4.02 million adult donors who self -identify as belonging to an underreprese nted racial or ethnic population and 2,000 cord blood units in FY 2023. The number of cord blood units collected varies yearly, based on funding levels and the contractors' ability to collect and store units from diverse populations. As shown in Table 2, the number of cord blood units released for transplants decreased in FY 2021 from FY 2020, at 313 and 344 cord blood units, respectively. The total number of cord blood units released for transplantation has been decreasing since FY 2016 due to the increa sing use of alternative therapies. Despite this recent trend, cord blood remains key in servicing a diverse population. Table 2. Cord Blood Units Released for Transplantation Fiscal Year Units Released for Transplantation Total Cord Blood Units (HRSA -funded and Non- HRSA funded) released BSCTP 2016 529 1,154 2017 494 1,050 2018 493 949 2019 459 848 2020 344 702 2021 313 589 303 Due to the lag between when cord blood units are collected and when they have been fully tested and qualified for listing on the public registry, not all of the units collected with funds from a given fiscal year will be available on the registry during that same fiscal year. 320 Funding History FY Amount FY $49,275,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Program of $49.3 million is equal to the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. The FY 2023 Request su pports continued progress toward the statutory goal of building a genetically and ethnically diverse inventory of at least 150,000 new units of high-quality cord blood for transplantation. HRSA estimates that approximately 2,000 additional cord blood unit s and 4 million adult volunteer donors from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations will be added and made available for patient searches in FY 2023. The budget request also continues the following activities: 1) collecting comprehensive outcomes data on both related and unrelated-donor blood stem cell transplants; 2) assessing the quality of life for transplant recipients; 3) working with international transplant centers to obtain data on U.S. stem cell products provided by U.S. products for inter national transplants; and, 4) continuing critical planning in collaboration with HHS on a response to a potential national radiation or chemical emergency. In such an event, casualties could involve temporary or permanent marrow failure and could require emergency transplants for individuals unable to recover marrow function. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. 321 Outputs and Outcomes Tables Me asure Year and Most Recent Result/ Target for Recent Result (Summary of Result) FY 2022 Targe t 2022 5020.01: The cumulative number of cord blood units from underrepresented r acial and ethnic populations available through the C.W.

Not Specified Allocation Methods: Direct Federal/Intramural Contract Program Description and Accomplishments The National Hansen's Disease Program (NHDP) provides medical care, education, and research for Hansen's disease (HD, leprosy) and related conditions as authorized since 1917. Medical care includes providing direct patient care (diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation), HD drug regimens at no cost to patients, consultati ons, laboratory services, and outpatient referral services to any patient residing in the United States (U.S.) or its territories. The Program strengthens the safety net infrastructure for patients with this rare disease by focusing on case management, patient compliance, and clinical training on the diagnosis and management of Hansen's disease. The Program makes specific outreach efforts to health care providers who are likely to encounter and treat patients in geographic areas most impacted by the disea se. The more complicated HD cases are treated as short -term referrals in the NHDP clinic in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Ninety -five percent of the human population is not susceptible to infection with Mycobacterium leprae or Mycobacterium lepromatosis, the bacteria that cause leprosy. Hansen's disease is not highly transmissible, is very treatable, and is not disabling with early diagnosis and treatment. Treatment with standard antibiotic drugs is very effective, and patients become noninfectious after tak ing only a few doses of medication and need not be isolated from family and friends. However, diagnosis in the U.S. is often delayed because many health care providers are unaware of Hansen's disease and its symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment prevent nerve involvement and the disability it causes. People with leprosy can generally continue their normal work and other activities while under treatment, which may last several years. Protect individuals, families, and communities against communicable and infectious disease through effective, innovative, readily available, and equitable delivery of treatment and therapeutics : Increasing health care provider knowledge about Hansen's disease will lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment, which are crucial to blocking or arresting the trajectory of Hansen's disease -related disability and deformity. The Program facilitates outpatient 324 management of leprosy by providing additional laboratory, diagnostic, consultative, and referral services to private -sector phys icians. NHDP increases U.S. health care providers' knowledge by serving as an education and referral center. The NHDP outpatient care is comprehensive and includes treatment protocols for multi -drug therapy, diagnostic studies, provider consultations, ancillary medical services, clinical laboratory analysis, hand and foot rehabilitation, leprosy surveillance, and indigent patient transportation. Improve the design, delivery, and outcomes of HHS programs by prioritizing science, evidence, and inclusion : The Program is improving health outcomes through scientific research. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for decreasing HD -related disability. With advanced scientific knowledge and breakthroughs in genomics and molecular biology, the Program has advanced the standard of care for leprosy diagnosis and treatment. Currently, lab research uses rapid techniques for diagnosis, assessment of drug resistance, and strain typing of leprosy bacilli to support effective treatment and determine the origin and transmission of infection. Invest in the research enterprise and the scientific workforce to maintain leadership in the development of innovations that broaden our understanding of disease, health care, public health, and human services resulting in more effective interventions, treatments, and programs : NHDP is the sole worldwide provider of reagent grade viable leprosy bacilli and collaborates with researchers across the globe to support scientific advances related to the disease. NHDP coordinates and c ollaborates with Federal, State, local, and private programs to promote and improve the quality of care and health outcomes related to Hansen's disease. Funding History FY Amount President's Budget $13,706,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for t he National Hansen's Disease Program of $13.7 million is equal to the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. This request supports the Program's prima ry focus of direct patient care activities and improving health outcomes for Hansen's disease patients. The funding level reflects improvements in health outcomes through research and health care provider education. NHDP will fund eleven ambulatory care contracts in FY 2023 with continuing efforts to align resources with levels of care. Hansen's disease patients with severe complications who are advanced on the HD spectrum or who have HD related disabilities may be referred to the primary clinic in Baton R ouge, free of charge. The National Hansen's Disease Program also 325 provides free HD medication to all providers upon request for the care and treatment of HD patients in the U.S. and its territories. The FY 2023 request will allow the NHDP to expand and enhance outreach and training activities to providers to improve early diagnosis and treatment to reduce permanent disability in patients. The funding request also includes costs associated with the contract review and award process, follow -up performance r eviews, information technology, and other program support costs. Outputs and Outcomes Table Me asure Year and Most Recent Result/ Target for Recent Result (Summary of Result) FY 2022 Targe t Number of healt h care training from NHDP (Output) FY 2021: 1037 Target: 350 (Target Met) 500 600 +100 5050.02 Number of human tissue samples on which clinically diagnostic Polymerase Chain Reactions were performed (Output) FY 2021: 235 Target: Not Defined (Historical Actual) 200 200 Maintain 3.II.B.1 Number of reagent - grade leprosy bacilli packages provided to research scientists outside of NHDP (Output) FY 2021: 32 Target: Not Defined (Historical Actual) 12 12 Maintain In FY 2021, NHDP filled the new role of Outreach and Education Coordinator. This role will increase HD outreach and education efforts to both the medical provider community and the general public through the use of increased virtual training, and an enhanced lear ning management system. Due to COVID -19 and the imposed travel restrictions, NHDP's traditional forms of outreach and education were less effective, and therefore target numbers were not met for FY 2020 and FY 2021. 326 Beginning in 2017, NHDP started conduct ing Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) on all tissue samples received. Using PCR in conjunction with histopathological interpretation of tissue samples increases the accuracy of HD diagnosis. Additionally, using PCR alone provides the determination of a positive diagnosis sooner, allowing the provider to start treatment protocols without delay. Finally, PCR is the only test currently available to distinguish between M. leprae and M. lepromatosis infection, which has important implications in the clinical management of the disease. The request will allow NHDP to continue support outreach and education to the medical community about the diagnosis and treatment of Hansen's disease. Finally, the request will provide for the purchase and maintenance of state -of-the-art laboratory equipment to perform PCR te sting of patient tissue samples. 327 National Hansen's Disease Program - Buildings and Facilities Activity FY 2021 Final FY 2022 --- --- --- --- Authorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Sections 320 and 321(a) FY 2023 Authorization ..........................................................................................

Not Specified Allocation Method ............................................................Competitive Cooperative Agreements Program Description and Accomplishments The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) is charged with advis ing the HHS Secretary on how rural health care is affected by current policies as well as proposed statutory, regulatory, administrative, and budgetary changes in the Medicare, Medicaid and other key HHS programs. The authorizing legislation requires FORHP to advise on: (1) the financial viability of small rural hospitals; (2) the ability of rural areas (particularly rural hospitals) to attract and retain physicians and other health professionals; and (3) access to and quality of health care in rural areas. FORHP is also charged with overseeing compliance, per the requirements of section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, related to assessing the impact of key regulations affecting a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Rural Health Policy Development funds a number of programs to carry out these advisory and compliance roles, including supporting clearinghouses for collecting and disseminating information on rural health care issues, promising approaches to improving and enhancing health care delive ry in rural communities, and policy-relevant research findings addressing rural health care delivery. FORHP provides funding for the only Federal research programs specifically designed to provide publically available, policy relevant studies on rural he alth issues : The Rural Health Research Center Program, the Rapid Response Rural Data Analysis and Issue Specific Research Studies Program, and the Rural Health Research Dissemination Program . The Rural Health Research Center (RHRC) Program funds eight core research centers to conduct policy -oriented health services research. The RHRCs produce policy briefs and peer -reviewed journal manuscripts and make their publications available to policy makers and other rural stakeholders at both the Federal and state levels. The Rapid Response Rural Data Analysis and Issue Specific Rural Research Studies Program supports one award to conduct rapid data analyses and shor t-term rural research studies. The Rural Health Research Dissemination Program , currently awarded to the Rural Health Research Gateway, disseminates and promotes 331 FORHP -funded rural health services research to stakeholders at the national, state, and community levels with the goal of informing and raising awareness of key policy issues important to rural communities. This research also align s with Administration priorities, such substance use, access to care and health equity. In FY 2021, these Federally -funded research programs conducted and disseminated 77 research reports, including policy briefs post ed on the Rural Health Research Gateway website and manuscripts published in peer -reviewed journals. The National Rural Health Information Clearinghouse Program, currently awarded to the Rural Health Information Hub, serves as a clearinghouse for information on rural health, including HRSA's rural health programs, for residents of rural areas in the United States and other rural health stakeholders. Rural Health Policy Development also supports the staffing for the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services (NACRHHS), which advises the HHS Secretary on rural health and human service programs and policies, produces policy briefs, and makes recommendations on emerging rural policy issues. In addition, FORHP continues to monitor and track the number of rural hospitals across the country that have closed completely or converted to another type of facility that provides only non-inpatient care. From January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2021, 137 rural hospitals have closed. FORHP has funded a number of grants that focus on addressing hospital closures, particularly mitigating the loss of services due to hospitals closing or facing financial distress. Funding History FY Amount FY $11,076,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for Rural Health Policy Development of $11.1 million is equal to the FY 2022 C ontinuing Resolution level.

Compe titive Grants and Cooperative Agreement Program Description and Accomplishments The Rural Health Care Services Outreach, Network and Quality Improvement Grants (Outreach programs) improve rural community health by focusing on quality improvement, increasi ng health care access, coordination of care, and integration of services. Outreach grant programs support collaborative models to deliver basic health care services to rural areas and are uniquely designed to meet rural needs. The grants allow rural communities to compete for funding against other rural communities, rather than competing against larger metropolitan communities with greater resources. The Outreach programs are among the only non-categorical grants within HHS, allowing grantees to determine the best ways to meet local needs. This flexibility responds to the unique health care challenges in rural communities and enables communities to determine the best approaches for addressing needs. Outreach Service Grants focus on improving access to heal th care in rural communities through community coalitions and evidence based and promising practice models. These grants focus on disease prevention, health promotion, and can support the expansion of services around primary care, opioid use disorder treatment and prevention, behavioral health, and oral health care. HRSA will support 61 continuing awards in FY 2023. Rural Network Development Grants support formalized partnerships among health care providers and social and community service organizations collaborating to improve access and enhance the quality of healthcare in rural areas. The program focuses on demonstrating improved health outcomes resulting from network collaboration, as well as positioning healthcare networks and their products and service s to be sustainable as the health care landscape continues to evolve. Grantees under this program are likely to focus on improving health outcomes, enhancing health care quality, and increasing services provided by the network. HRSA will make 44 new awards in FY 2023. Network Planning Grants assist in the development of integrated healthcare networks to address local health care challenges. The Network Planning program provides an opportunity for grantees to work on priority and emerging local public health issues, such 334 as care coordination, patient engagement, rural hospital closure/conversion, telehealth, mental health, and substance use (particularly opioid use disorder). HRSA will make 20 new awards in FY 2023. Small Healthcare Provider Quality Improveme nt Gr ants help improve patient care and chronic disease outcomes by assisting rural primary care providers with the implementation of quality improvement activities. Specifically, program objectives include increased care coordination, enhanced chronic dis ease management, and improved health outcomes for patients. An additional program goal is to prepare rural health care providers for quality reporting and pay-for -performance programs. HRSA will support 40 continuing awards in FY 2023 . The Delta States Ru ral D evelopment Network Grant Program provides network development grants to the eight states in the Mississippi Delta for network and rural health infrastructure development. This program is geographically targeted, given the health care disparities acros s this eight -state region. The program supports chronic disease management, oral health services, and recruitment and retention efforts for health professionals. The program requires grantees to focus on diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity and to develop programs based on promising practices or evidence -based models. HRSA will make 12 new awards in FY 2023. Delta Region Community Health Systems Development Program helps r ural communities address their health care needs in a targeted manner and ass ists small rural hospitals and clinics improve their financial and operational performance. The program also provides resources to help rural communities develop partnerships and jointly address health problems that affect the Delta region. HRSA will support 20 continuing communities and 10 new communities in FY 2023 under one grantee . HRSA runs this program in coordination with the Delta Regional Authority and will continue to support the Delta Region Community Health Systems Development award in FY 2023. Rural Health Care Coordination Program supports rural health consortiums/networks aiming to achieving the overall goals of improving access, delivery, and quality of care through the application of care coordination strategies in rural communities. The goa ls of the program is to 1) enhance integrated systems to collaborate and share data among member organizations; 2) develop effective care coordination workforce to meet needs within the rural communities; 3) improve access, delivery, and quality of services and overall patients' health outcomes; and 4) increase program financial sustainability. HRSA will make 10 new awards in FY 2023. Rural Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies (RMOMS) grants improve access and continuity of maternal and obstetrics care in rural communities. In FY 2019, HRSA created RMOMS in response to research by the University of Minnesota that revealed a decreasing availability of obstetric units in rural areas.309 RMOMS goals include: (1) improve maternal and neonatal outcomes within a rural region; 309 Hung P, Henning -Smith C, Casey M, Kozhimannil, K. Access to Obstetric Services in Rural Counties Still Declining, with 9 Percent Losing Services, 2004 -14. Health Affairs. 2017; 36 (9): 1663- 1671. doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0338 335 (2) develop a sustainable network approach to increase the delivery and access of preconception, pregnancy, labor and delivery, and postpartum services ; (3) develop a safe delivery environment with the support and access to specialty care for peri natal women and infants; and (4) develop sustainable financing models for the provision of maternal and obstetrics care in rural hospitals and communities. As part of an HHS -wide initiative to improve maternal health, HRSA will support 3 continuing awards and make additional 7 new awards in FY 2023. The Outreach programs continue to conduct program evaluations and build evidence -based models for new ways to improve health care in rural communities. Evaluations focus on measuring program impact on the health st atus of rural residents with chronic conditions and economic impact of the Federal investment in rural communities. Grantees use the Rural Health Information (RHI) Hub's Economic Impact Analysis310 tool to assess the economic impact of Federal investments. T he tool translates project impacts into community-wide benefits, such as number of jobs created, new spending, and impacts of new and expanded services. Grantees are also required to demonstrate program impact through outcome -focused measures. Grantees t rack and submit to HRSA baseline data throughout their project periods and implement programs that are adapted from promising practices or evidence -based models. The programs support innovative models that offer rural communities the tools and resources to enhance health care services and ease the transition to health care models focusing on improved quality and value. While making the initial Federal investment in a rural area, each of the grant programs expects the communities to continue providing the services at the conclusion of the grant funding. As each project periods end, the Outreach programs continually assess program sustainability. While sustainability rates may vary across grantee cohorts, HRSA expects the majority of projects to continue aft er Federal funding. Across the investments made in the Outreach programs, findings and key lessons learned from evaluations and case studies are gathered and made available on the RHI Hub's Community Health Gateway 311 so that rural communities from across th e country can benefit from Outreach program investments and results. Grant funds are also used to support the technical assistance for grantees to ensure successful implementation of their programs and evaluation to demonstrate outcomes of the program. 310 https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/econtool 311 https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/community -health 336 Funding Budget $90,000,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Rural Health Care Services Outreach, Network and Quality Improvement Grants program s of $90.0 million is $7.5 million above the FY 2022 C ontinuing Resolution level.

Expired Allocation Method ........................................... Competitive Grants and Cooperative Agreements Program Description and Accomplishments The Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants are offered through three grant programs: Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant (Flex) Program supports a partnership between 45 states and more than 1,300 Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to work on quality and performance improvement activities, as well as help eligible rural hospitals convert to CAH status and enhance CAH -related emergency medical services. The Flex Program's goal is to help CAHs maintain high quality and economically viable facilities to ensure that rural community residents, particularly Medicare beneficiaries, have access to high - quality health care services. States use Flex resources to address identified CAH needs and to achieve improved and measurable outcomes in each selected program area. With FY 2023 funds, HRSA will continue to support a second year of a two-year initiative supporting emer gency medical services (EMS) across six states and focusing on quality and operational improvement initiatives. Funding supports technical assistance and data analysis activities to build the capacity of states and hospitals to carryout quality and perform ance improvement areas of need in meeting the goals of this program . The Flex Program plays a key role in ensuring that CAHs are aligned with certain Medicare Program quality initiatives. All prospective payment system hospitals (PPS) are required to submit quality data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to receive a full Medicare payment update. While not subject to this CMS requirement, CAHs, through this program, can elect to submit quality data to CMS to demonstrate areas of high quality while also identifying areas for improvement. This provides an avenue for ensuring that CAH quality efforts are aligned with broader Medicare quality initiatives. HRSA continues strategic planning efforts for the future direction of the Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project to ensure it aligns with hospital priorities in providing high quality care , and in FY 2022, is running a quality improvement initiative encourage peer learning on quality priorities . 339 State Flex grantees adjusted their activities, moved trainings online, and adjusted topics based on the emerging needs of hospitals given the impacts on the pandemic. Given the focus of hospitals during the pandemic, the results below show a decrease in the percent of hospitals showing improvement as hospitals focused on pandemic related care and not on planned grant improvement initiatives. The participation in CAHs in the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers & Systems ( HCAHPS) patient experience remained high in spite of t he pandemic. Given the focus of hospitals on continued pandemic response, the target for FY 2023 has been a djusted to reflect this change. Small Rural Hospital Improvement Program (SHIP) provides support to rural hospitals with fewer than 50 beds to enhanc e their administrative capabilities in meeting information technology and reporting requirements under value -based care through awards to 46 states with eligible hospitals. SHIP provides funding for equipment and training to upgrade billing requirements, s uch as incorporating new ICD -10 standards, and for software, that captures patient satisfaction data. Flex Rural Veterans Health Access Program focuses on increasing the delivery of mental health services or other health care services to meet the needs of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom veterans living in rural areas. Grantees focus educating community providers on how best serving veterans. HRSA collaborates with the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) Office of Rural Health to co nnect the state level grantees with VHA knowledge and expertise. Funding History $57,509,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Rural Hospital Flexibility grant program of $57.5 million is $1.9 million above the FY 2022 C ontinuing Resolution level. This request will increase support to states for the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant and support the continued efforts for the Small Rural Hospital Improvement Grant and the Rural Veterans Health Access Program .

Expired Allocation Method ........................................................................................ Competitive Grants Program Description and Accomplishments This grant program provides funding to establish and maintain a State Office of Rural Health (SORH) within states to strengthen rural health care delivery systems. Every dollar of Federal support is matched by three state dollars. SORHs serve as focal points and clearinghouses for the collection and dissemination of information on rural health issues, research findings, innovative approaches, and best practices pertaining to the delivery of health care in rural areas. As the state's rural institutional framework, SORHs help link rural communities with state and Feder al resources to develop long-term solutions to rural health problems. SORHs form collaborative partnerships to better c oordinate rural health activities, maximize limited resources, and avoid duplication of effort and activities. SORHs facilitate clinical placements through recruitment initiatives and help rural constituents meet recruitment challenges by sharing information. SORHs identify Federal, state, and nongovernmental programs and funding opportunities and provide technical assistance to public and nonprofit private entities regarding participation in rural health programs. All SORHs played a role in supporting COVID -19 information sharing on public health information during the pandemic, and many SORHs were actively involved in state response efforts. The number of TA encounters and clients increased for the second year of the pandemic year as SORH continued to play a key role in sharing information and resources with rural communities during the pandemic. 343 Funding History FY Amount FY $12,500,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the State Offices of Rural Health program of $12.5 million is equal to the FY 2022 C ontinuing Resolution level. This request will continue to invest in the State Offices of Rural Health. With this level of funding, states will continue to support rural communities by connecting them with resources about funding opportunities, information on health care policy changes. The State Offices of Rural Health will partner with federal, regional, state, local agencies, and communities to improve access to high quality maternal health and behavioral health services in rural areas.

Not Specified Allocation Method Competitive Grants Program Description and Accomplishments The Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program (RESEP) provides grants to states, local governments, and appropriate health care organizations to support programs for cancer screening for individuals adversely affected by the mining, transport and processing of uranium and the testing of nuclear weapons for the Nation's weapons arsenal. The RESEP grantees also help clients with appropriate medical referrals, engage in public information development and dissemination, and facilitate claims documentation to aid individuals who may wish to apply for support under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. In FY 2020, the number of individuals screened at RESEP was 738. Funding $2,734,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Radiation Exposure and Screening Education program of $2.7 million is $0.9 million above the FY 2022 C ontinuing Resolution level. This request will expand current support activities such as: implementing cancer screening programs; developing education programs; disseminating information on radiogenic diseases and the importance of early detection; screening eligible individuals for cancer and other radiogenic diseases; providing appropriate referrals for medical treatment; and facilitating documentation of Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) claims. 346 Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award proces s, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs . Outputs and Outcomes Tables RESEP is authorized under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), which is under the purview of the Department of Justice (DO J). Per the Act, compensation claims processed by DOJ cannot be processed after July 11, 2022. Thus, HRSA has updated its performance measure targets in alignment with the statute.

Competitive Grants and Cooperative Agreement Program Description and Accomplishments The Black Lung Clinics Program (BLCP) funds eligible public, private, and state entities that provide medical, outreach, educational, and benefits counseling services to active, inactive, retired, and disabled coal miners throughout the United States with the goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with occupationally related coal -mine dust lung disease. To support the longer -term need faced by miners with severe disability due to black lung disease, grantees may also assist coal miners and their families in preparing the detailed application for Federal Black Lung benefits from the Department of Labor (DOL). In the recent years, most grantees have been able to use funds to upgrade equipment, enhance their workforce capacity and increase behavioral health screenings and care integration. HRSA also funds the Black Lung Data and Resource Center (BLDRC ), formerly known as Black Lung Centers for Excellence (BLCE), in supporting and strengthening the operations of BLCP awardees and their ability to examine and treat respiratory and pulmonary impairments in active and inactive coal miners. BL DRC supports BLCP awardees through improved data collection, analysis and expanding the body of knowledge of the health status and needs of coal miners nationally. HRSA uses a patient -level data reporting system to better capture the number of coal miners served, and the number and types of medical and benefits counseling services received. HRSA can track a unique coal miner patient's disease and case progression to better assess the quality and breadth of services provided. The data collected also better aligns with other publical ly available data such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program and Department of Labor's (DOL) Division of Coal Mine Workers' Compensation program. HRSA continues to monitor black lung disease across its grantees and in coordination with NIOSH. This includes focusing on previously identified clusters of progressive massive fibrosis (PMF), which affects miners at a younger age and with greater clinical severity. 348 The impact of COVID -19 was felt within the Black Lung Clinic Program. The screening process that Black Lung Clinic grantees work through with their patients include aerosol generating activities, such as the pulmonary function test (PFT), that must be performed in person. The population served by these grantees, former and current black lung miners suffering from respiratory diseases, are also at very high risk for death or severe illness if exposed to COVID - 19. All grantees made the necessary adjustments to adhere to recommende d COVID -19 precautions, and several have taken the steps to install negative pressure rooms in their clinics. However, the steps necessary to minimize risk to patients and staff, decreased the number of patients that can be screened and treated. Consequen tly, grantees have seen lowered patient numbers at clinics and attendance at outreach events in the last year. Funding History FY Amount FY Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Black Lung program of $12.2 million is $0.7 million above the FY 2022 C ontinuing Resolution level. HRSA will continue to fund 15 Black Lung Clinic Program awards that provide primary care and other services to coal miners and a cooperative agreement with the Black Lung Data and Resource Center to enhance the quality of services provided by BLCP grantees. Increased funding will allow Black Lung Clinics to expand precautionary measures and sc reening activities given the unique health concerns of the population served by Black Lung Clinics and the effects of long COVID on patients with respiratory and pulmonary impairments. The Black Lung Data and Resource Center will work closely with HRSA to strengthen the quality of data collection and analysis. Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs . 349 Outputs and Outcomes Tables HRSA has lowered the Program's FY 2023 performance measure targets in anticipation of the long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Black Lung Clinics.

Not Specified Allocation Method .................................................. Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreement Program Description and Accomplishments The purpose of the Rural Residency Planning and Development Program is to expand the number of rural residency training programs and subsequently increase the number of physicians choosing to practice in rural areas. For the purpose of this program, rural residencies are allopathic and osteopathic physician residency training programs that primarily train in rural communities. This includes Rural Track Programs (RTPs), a specific model of rural residency training in which residents receive more than 50 percent of their training in a rural location after spending their initial year in a larger, often urban, residency setting. Research has shown that residents often prac tice near where they comp lete their residency training. RTP graduates are twice as likely to practice family medicine in a rural setting as compared to family medicine residents trained in an urban program. The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy collaborates with HRSA's Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) to fund two programs: Rural Residency Planning and Development (RRPD) Program creates new physician residency training programs that support physician workforce expansion in rural areas and that are sustai nable beyond the grant performance period through public (i.e., Medicare or Medicaid), other state, or private funding. Recipients may use funds to cover planning and development costs incurred while achieving program accreditation through the Accreditatio n Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Rural Residency Planning and Development Technical Assistance (RRPD -TA) Program funds a cooperative agreement that serves as a technical assistance center to support RRPD recipients . Since program inception in FY 2018, the RRPD Program has issued 46 awards across three cohorts of grantees as well as continuous funding for technical assistance under the RRPD -TA Program. As of February 2022, 25 RRPD recipients have received ACGME accreditation ahead of schedule. 351 Funding History FY Amount $12,700,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Rural Residency Planning and Developme nt program of $12.7 million is $2.2 million above the FY 2022 C ontinuing Resolution level. With increased funding in FY 2023, HRSA anticipates making 16 new awards under the RRPD Program and providing additional support for technical assistance under the R RPD-TA Program. The previous RRPD competitions generated significant interest from rural stakeholders and HRSA received more competitive applications than they were able to fund; HRSA anticipates similar interest in the FY 2023 competition. In December 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) finalized regulations implementing policies based on legislative changes relative to Medicare graduate medical education (GME) for teaching hospitals provided by sections 126, 127, and 131 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA), 2021 (86 FR 73416). These policy changes may increase interest among rural hospitals in developing medical residency programs and increase the demand for RRPD grant awards. Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

Not Specified Allocation Method .................................................. Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreement Program Description and Accomplishments The Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) initiative aims to reduce the morbi dity and mortality associated with substance use disorder (SUD), including opioid use disorder (OUD), in high need rural communities by establishing, expanding, and sustaining prevention, treatment, and recovery services at the county, state, and/or regional levels . Since RCORP's inception in FY 2018, the program has invested over $404 million in grants and technical assistance to rural communities serving more than 1,500 counties across 47 states and two territories. The most recent performance measurement data reports shows that RCORP grantees active in FY 2020 provided direct SUD/OUD prevention, treatment, and recovery services to 2,079,373 rural residents, and ensured that 70,869 rural residents received medication assisted treatment (MAT) services. The RCORP initiative aligns with, and is a part of, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Overdose Prevention Strategy released in October 2021. HRSA supports the following grant and cooperative agreement programs through RCORP: RCORP-Implementati on provides multi -year support to rural communities to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with SUD/OUD by establishing and/or expanding SUD/OUD services. The core/required activities of this program include, but are not limited to, naloxone trai ning, distribution, and administration; identifying and screening at risk individuals for SUD/OUD and referring them to harm reduction services, treatment, and other support services; building the workforce and infrastructure to support evidence -based Medi cation -Assisted Treatment (MAT) provision; and expanding the peer recovery workforce and recovery support services. HRSA awarded 78 Implementation awards in FY 2021 and approximately awards in cohort's period of performance has ended. HRSA does not anticipate recompeting this program in FY 2023. RCORP- Behavioral Health Care Support provides support to rural communities to respond to new and ongoing behavioral health needs of rural residents at risk for, or diagnosed with, SUD/OUD and/or co-occurring disorders . The program focuses on 354 building the infrastructural capacity of rural communities to deliver behavioral health, including SUD/OUD, services across the continuum ; enhancing care coordination to provide effective care; and addressing social determinants of health to promote health equity. HRSA will support the continuation of approximately 26 awards in FY 2023. RCORP-Rural Centers of Excellence on Substance Use Dis orders support the dissemination of best practices related to the treatment for and prevention of substance use disorders within rural communities, with a focus on the current opioid crisis. HRSA will recompete these cooperative agreements in FY 2023. RCORP-Behavioral Health Care Technical Assistance and RCORP -Evaluation provide technical assistance and evaluation support encompassing the entire RCORP initiative. HRSA will support the continuation of funding for one RCORP -initiative wide technical assist ance HRSA will also recompete the RCORP initiative-wide evaluation cooperative agreement in FY 2023. Rural Behavioral Health Workforce Centers develop and implement training and mentorship programs that build the capacity of rural health care providers, paraprofessionals, non-clinical staff, and community members to care for individuals with behavioral health, including SUD/OUD, needs in rural locations within the Northern Border Regional Commission. HRSA will continue funding these cooperative agreements in FY 2023. Funding History FY Amount $165,000,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Rural Community Opioid Response program of $165.0 million is $55.0 million above the FY 2022 C ontinuing Resolution level. This request will support the development and continuation of grant programs that provide needed behavioral health, including SUD/OUD, services to rural resident s. With the increased resources, HRSA will fund new awards allowing rural communities to respond to new and ongoing behavioral health needs of rural residents impacted by SUD/OUD. Programs will include support for approximately 30 rural communities to increase access to medication -assisted treatment services and training for providers. HRSA will also address health equity through the RCORP initiative by funding approximately 20 awards through a tribal - focused behavioral health support program. HRSA will continue engaging with rural stakeholders and Federal partners to identify new and emerging areas to combatting this devastating epidemic and identifying additional priority areas. 355 This request will also enable HRSA to continue expanding RCORP's focus to include other, emergent behavioral health needs in rural communities. In FY 2022, HRSA piloted a new program targeting rural individuals with SUD/OUD and/or co-occurring disorders, in recognition of the fact that about half of those who experience an SUD during their lifetime will also experience a mental illness, and vice versa.320 In FY 2023, HRSA plans to continue funding the FY 2022 behavioral health pilot program, existing cooperative agreements that provide needed technical assistance, evaluation, and workforce development support, and the new medication-assisted treatment and tribal -focused grant programs. Finally, this request will enable HRSA to strengthen RCORP's commitment to reducing disparities in health outcomes and access among vulnerable populations. In accordance with Executive Order 13985, RCORP programs will continue to emphasize consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who live in underserved communities that have been denied such treatment . Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs .

Funding will focus on rural communities that are not already served by Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) providing behavioral and mental health services. RHCs are key safety net providers for rural residents and serve as a vital link to primary and ambulatory care services in the 712 counties where there is no FQHC . 324 This initiative will target areas where there are no other behavioral health services being provided. Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put some rural residents at increased risk of having severe illness including mental and behavioral health issues. Rural areas represent nearly 60 percent of Mental Health Professional Shortage Area s, encompassing more than 25 million people who do not have adequate access to mental health car e providers.325 Over 13 percent of rural counties have no behavioral health care providers at all.326 Rural suicide rates outpace urban suicide rates, and this difference has continued to widen over time.327 Additionally, one in five rural residents identify with one of more of the following groups, Black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), Asian American/Pacific Islander (AA/PI), or mixed race. RHCs serve two -thirds of the majority- minority counties in the U.S., and provide essential services to populations that experience health disparities at a higher rate than people who identify as non-Hispanic White. 1,328 More specifically: 406 RHCs are located within and serve 127 of the 192 majority-minority counties329: o 115 RHCs serve 45 of the 66 counties with populations that are majority Black o 272 RHCs serve 71 of the 99 counties with populations that are majority Hispanic 324 HRSA analysis of 2021 CMS Provider of Services data 325 Designated HPSA Quarterly Summary, 2020 326 WWAMI, 2019 327 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db373.htm 328 National Association of Rural Health Clinics 329 HRSA Rural Health Clinic data 358 o 19 RHCs serve 11 of the 27 counties with populations that are majority Indigenous people This Initiative will focus on the rural a reas wh ere there is the greatest need for essential services. RHCs are an underutilized critical health care reso urce for rural communities and have the capacity to fulfill a need if given targeted financial resources and technical assistance. This was recently d emonstrated when HRSA made 791 COVID-19 capacity grants to RHC s to increase vaccine confidence in rural communities. Less than 10 percent of RHCs employ either a social worker and/or psychologist. To address this inequity, RHCs funded through this program will be able to use grant funds to cover the salary of a behavioral health provider , address provider burnout by supporting the resilience and mental well-being of providers , and expand the availability of services such as mental health screenings, counse ling, and therapy. This is of particular importance as the nation looks to rebound from the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. This program will afford RHCs the time build their mental and behavioral health practice and develop sustainable billing capacity to allow these activities to sustain beyond the three year grant program. This short -term investment will provide long-term impact, with sustainability a key tenet of this program. Funding Request FY Amount FY 2019 --- FY 2020 --- FY 2022 CR FY 2023 President's Budget $10,000,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Rural Health Clinic Initiative of $10.0 million is a new initiative and not included in the FY 2022 CR level. The request will fund approximately 18 RHCs at $500,000 per clinic and includes the cost of technical assistance, program evaluation, and other administrative costs. This funding will bring critical health care services to rural communities through RHCs, such as behavioral health services, where those services do not exist. This pilot initiative will result in an increase in the number of rural residents who receive behavioral and mental health services, the number of behavioral and mental health professionals in rural communities, and the numbe r of RHCs that are able to bill for behavioral and mental health services. Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs . 359 Outputs and Outcomes Tables The intended outcome of the Rural Health Clinic Initiative as a whole is to ensure RHCs remain equipped to provide high quality, accessible health care services to rural residents across the United States. The estimated outcome of this program is to support the integration of mental health services into existing primary care services at RHCs and increase the availability of mental health services in rural communities.

One of HRSA's goals is to strengthen program management and operations by improving program customer satisfaction, increasing employee engagement, and implementing organizational improvements and innovative projects. Program Management is the primary means of support for staff, business operations and processes, information technology and overhead expenses such as rent, utilities, and miscellaneous charges for HRSA. Improving Processes and Business Operations HRSA continues to improve operational planning processes to foster cross -agency collaboration. HRSA has automated its contracting process to operate in a totally paperless environment, including the receipt of committed funds, the obligation of funds, and the generation and storage of contract documents. In FY 2021, HRSA enhanced IT end-user support by transitioning to Zoom for government, i mplementing Microsoft Teams, and completing a HRSA -wide desktop upgrade. Developing a 21st Century Workforce Numerous efforts are underway to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the agency and to ensure the workforce is positioned to succeed in the 21st century. The hiring process has been streamlined, reducing the time it takes to complete the hiring cycle from recruitment to onboarding. HRSA streamlined several hiring processes, which significantly contributed to a 39% increase in new hires for 2021, outpacing separations by almost 3-to -1. HRSA is focused on intense employee engagement improvement efforts. In 2021, HRSA led HHS in the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (EVS) employee engagement (83%) and satisfaction (82%) scores. HRSA leaders prioritized employee engagement and well -being, holding monthly all hands meetings and regular listening sessions allowing leaders to engage employees at all levels, and gain feedback to inform decision making. An agency-wide training on \"Burnout and Stress Management\" also helped equip supervisors with tools needed to support 362 their employees during the unprecedented COVID -19 crisis and associated stressors, including significantly increased workloads and the rapid shift to maximum telework. Sharing Quality Ser vices HRSA relies on HHS -provided shared services for many of the services, such as human resources, financial management, grants, and procurement. HRSA actively seeks out and deploys shared services to improve and simplify processes, and to maximize the efficiency of shared services with other components of HHS. Cre ating a Culture of Program Inte grity Program Management also supports Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) activities that align with core principles and performance and strategic planning activiti es to reduce programmatic risk and improve performance. HRSA has established a HRSA-wide governance structure for enterprise -wide business operations and risk management activities to ensure a proactive and customer -focused suite of business operation services and risk management functions. HRSA is currently engaged in ERM implementation strategies aligned with the revised OMB Circular A -123. Recent revisions to the circular's Appendices A and C, respectively, include prioritizing risk -based assessments an d a focus on fraud identification and prevention activities. HRSA's ERM efforts include Governance and Process support for the promotion of a risk-aware organizational culture, the creation of a comprehensive view of risks to drive strategic decision making and the establishment and communication of risk appetite. Operations during the COVID -19 Pandemic During the COVID -19 pandemic, HRSA used its secure and mobile infrastructure to immediately transition to 100 percent telework for all staff. HRSA averages approximately 3,000 Virtual Private Network sessions per day. HRSA also implemented new technologies to quickly disperse Provider Relief funds to hospitals and healthcare providers on the front lines of the coronavirus response. Using enhanced technologie s HRSA was able to reduce its grant award cycle from 90-120 days to 12-18 days for COVID -19 grants. In addition, HRSA enhanced its data warehouse functionality to highlight pandemic response and added testing data to help the public find Health Center COV ID-19 testing sites. Funding History Reques t The FY 2023 Budget Request of $168.9 million is $13.7 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. This funding level supports program management activities to effectively and efficiently support HRSA's operations. An additional $13.7 million is requested to further support HRSA operations at an overall increased funding level of $1.3 billion over FY 2022 Continuing Resolution. HRSA is committed to improving quality at a lower cost and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of government operations. HRSA supports telework by increasing the a gency-wide utilization of web collaboration tools, which have led to greater business productivity. HRSA also continues to enhance its program integrity activities by supporting analytical tools using HRSA's electronic grants system, program data, Office of Federal Assistance Management data sources, HHS sources, and government -wide sources. The goal is for HRSA to identify potential issues in the pre - and post -award processes and to address issues before they become audit findings. HRSA plans to focus on a risk -based approach to grantee monitoring using the information and corresponding analysis to help staff spend their time on grantees at risk of noncompliance. HRSA will also continue to provide training for grants management and program staff to support the alignment of program integrity initiatives with planning and performance activities. These efforts will enhance HRSA grantees awareness and ability to avoid potent ial financial integrity issues. IT Investments Significant progress has been made in a range of program management activities. Some highlights include: Improved HRSA IT security incident prevention, detection and response capabilities by expanding tools into our Sterling colocation center, continuing to enhance network traffic protections via the Palo Alto firewalls, including preventing SSNs from being sent in unencrypted email within the network and preventing it from leaving the HRSA network in clear text, establishing a test environment and playbooks for a new security orchestration tool, Phantom, which automates manual repeatable tasks for incident response staff, enabling them to focus on the more obscure anomalies and threat prevention, and deploying a robust code and open source scanning suite of tools to fill several gaps in vulner ability detection in the HRSA environment. Continue implementation of the Enterprise Architecture, Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) and Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC) processes. Successfully transitioned the CPIC reporting from PRO SIGHT to the FOLIO tool for all IT investments. Enhanced Electronic Handbooks (EHBs) to support rapid-release timelines for the COVID-19 supplemental funding awards to HRSA grantees by identifying areas for automation to expedite award processing. Improved EHB user's experience by implementing automated Chatbot User Interface to permit self -service by users. Since implementation, over 2,000 account management requests have been handled via Chatbot. 364 Continue modernizing the Data Warehouse by adding COVID -19 dashboards and other resources to highlight HRSA's pandemic response and COVID -19 testing data to find a Health Center to help the public find COVID -19 testing sites. Enhanced IT end-user support by transitioning our primary Virtual Meeting platform from Adobe Connect to Zoom for Government. This has provided a more up-to -date platform with additional features as well as a 5 year savings of over $6 million. Additionally implemented Microsoft Teams to provide a feature rich collaboration platform that pr ovides audio/video calling and conferencing, chat, and file sharing all in a secure environment. MS Teams has become the primary collaboration platform at HRSA.

Authorizing Legislation - Title X of the Public Health Service Act FY 2023 Authorization............................................................................. Expired Allocation Method: Direct Federal Contract Competitive Grant Program Description and Accomplishments The Title X Family Planning Program is the only federal grant program dedicated to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning and related health services. Enacted in 1970 as part of the Public Health Service Act, the mission of the Title X Program is to assist individuals and families in determining the number and spacing of children and to provide access to voluntary family planning methods, services, and information to all who want and need them. Title X authorizing legislation requires that projects provide a broad range of effective and acceptable family planning methods and services, including fertility awareness -based methods, infertility services and services for adolescents. By law, priority is given to persons from low - income families. The Title X Program is administered by the Office of Population Affairs (OPA) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH). Advancing equity for all, including people from low -income families, peop le of color, and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality, is a priority for the Department, for OASH/OPA, and for the Title X program. Grantees, subrecipients, and services si tes funded by the Title X program work to ensure that the predominantly low -income clients who rely on Title X services as their usual source of medical care have access to the same quality healthcare, including full medical information and referrals, that higher -income clients and clients with private insurance are able to access. Key strategies for advancing equity include removing barriers to accessing services, improving the quality of services, and providing services that are client -centered. The Title X Program fulfills its mission through awarding competitive grants to public and private nonprofit organizations. According to the 2020 Family Planning Annual Report (FPAR) 367 data (the most recent data available), in 2020 Title X services were provided thr ough a nationwide network of 3,031 community-based sites that provided clinical and educational services to 1,536,743 persons. As a result of the provision of a broad range of effective and acceptable family planning methods, counseling and education, and other clinical services, the Title X Program was responsible for the prevention of an estimated 331,749 unintended pregnancies. Title X also plays an essential role in helping to prevent and treat sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In 2020, Title X ser vice sites tested 679,023 female and male clients for chlamydia; 772,620 tests for gonorrhea; 325,813 tests for syphilis; and conducted 429,545 confidential tests for HIV. Of the confidential HIV tests performed, 1,359 were positive for HIV. As of August 2020, there was at least one Title X services grantee in 44 of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in each of the U.S. territories, including the six Pacific jurisdictions. The current Title X grantees are in their third and final year of funding in FY 2021. In October 2021, OPA issued a funding opportunity announcement for a national competition to provide Title X services funding for up to five years. OPA also funded a new cohort of Title X grantees serving in areas with dire need for Title X services In FY 2022, OPA also made available COVID ARP funding to support one -time telehealth enhancement and expansion grants for Title X entities. In FY 2022, the Title X program also launched FPAR 2.0 to allow for encounter -level data collection of Title X systems. Focusing on better data collection will increase the ability to drive policy and report on the outputs and outcomes of Title X projects and the overall program. In October 2021, the Department finalized rulemaking to revise the regulations (effect ive November 8, 2021) that govern the Title X family planning program (authorized by Title X of the Public Health Service Act) by readopting the 2000 regulations (65 FR 41270), with several revisions to ensure access to equitable, affordable, client -center ed, quality family planning services for all clients, especially for low -income clients. Funding History FY Amount $400,000,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Title X Family Planning Program of $400.0 million is $113.52 million above the FY 2022 CR level. This request will fund family planning services for approximately four million individuals, with 90 percent having family incomes at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level. Funds will also support demonstration grants to test innovative approaches to family planning service delivery that build on national efforts to achieve health equity and improve health outcomes for medically underserved populations. The 368 FY 2023 request will also allow the program to continue providing training and technical assistance to grantees including supporting the operation of the Reproductive Health National Training Center and the National Clinical Training Center for Family Planning. OPA is increasing its focus on access, equity, and quality through a number of programmatic activities to support Title X projects. In FY 2023, OPA will continue to update the Quality Family Planning guidelines, the nationally recognized standards of care that define quality in a family planning visit. In addition, OPA is continuing to stress the importance of restoring and expanding access to quality services, leveraging community-based educat ion and outreach and telehealth to assist individuals and families with effective family planning services and related preventive health services. Outputs and Outcomes Tables Long Term Objective: Increase awareness of voluntary family planning resources and methods by providing Title X family planning services, education and research, with priority for services to low -income individuals. The targets for FY 2023 assume other sources of revenue that contribute to the family planning program at the grantee level will remain at current levels, including Medicaid, state and local government programs, other federal, state, and private grants, and private insurance.

These include Federally Qualified Health Centers, AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, children's hospitals, and eligible rural and dispropor tionate share hospitals. The 340B Program helps these safety net health care providers sustain and expand care for their patients. The 340B ceiling price - the maximum amount a drug manufacturer can charge a covered entity for a given drug - is equal to the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) minus the Unit Rebate Amount, both set by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). In 2020, total sales in the 340B Program were approximately $38 billion. Covered entities saved between 25 to 50 percent o n what they would have otherwise paid for covered outpatient drugs. HRSA estimates 340B sales are approximately 7.2 percent of the total U.S. drug market. HRSA prioritizes the integrity of the 340B Program and continually works to improve Program oversight . Examples of HRSA compliance activities include : Audits of covered entities to assure compliance within the Program: Since FY 2012, HRSA completed 1,720 covered entity audits, which included review of 23,278 offsite outpatient facilities and 40,811 cont ract pharmacies. Final audit results, including statuses of corrective actions, are available on HRSA's website; Review of every non-compliance allegation , including, if necessary, through on-site audits ; Audits of manufacturers: Since FY 2015, HRSA fi nalized 31 audits of manufacturers which represents 4% of all participating manufacturer to ensure compliance with the one statutory obligation of manufacturers to sell at or below the 340B ceiling price; Activity FY 2021 Final FY 19 25 +6 372 Assistance to covered entities that self -disclose compliance issues, including developing corrective action plans and working with affected manufacturers ; Implementation of an Administrative Dispute Resolution process to address disputes between covered entities and manufacturers. Publi cation of verified ceiling prices of covered outpatient drugs available for purchase under the 340B Program on a quarterly basis in the 340B Office of Pharmacy Affairs Information System (OPAIS), Pricing Component. Funding History FY Amount $17,238 ,000 Budget Request The FY 2023 Budget Request for the Office of Pharmacy Affairs/340B Drug Pricing Program of $17.2 million is $7.0 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. The requested amount will support implementation of 340B Program statutory obligations, oversight of participating manufacturers and covered entities, operational improvements, and increased efficiencies using information t echnology. The $7 million increase will allow the 340B Program to continue to build on its program integrity efforts. These additional resources will support the implementation of an Administrative Dispute Resolution process to resolve (1) claims by cove red entities of being overcharged for covered outpatient drugs by manufacturers and (2) claims by manufacturers, after the manufacturer has conducted an audit of a covered entity, of violat ion of the prohibition on diversion or duplicate discounts. This includes establish ing an intake system and security controls for protecting proprietary information. Further, this additional funding will increase the audit and oversight functions of the program , including up to 30 additional audits . HRSA is also propos ing general rulemaking authority to strengthen the 340B Program. HRSA has exercised the limited regulatory authority that exists in the 340B statute ( regarding ceiling price calculation, civil monetary penalties for manufacturers, and establishing an a lternative dispute resolution process), but continues to confront significant operational challenges caused by the lack of broader authority for overseeing the program . General rulemaking authority for the 340B Program through a statutory amendment would allow HHS to set clear, enforceable standards for participation in all aspects of the 340B Program and help ensure compliance and transparency with 340B Program requirements. The FY 2023 Budget Request also provides resources for the 340B Program to educ ate participating covered entities and prospective sites on compliance with statutory requirements. For participating covered entities, HRSA will continue to expand its oversight activities, producing a sentinel effect of increased compliance, as 340B data shows education based on 373 oversight measures reduces the risk of future compliance issues. In addition, the request supports facilitation of refunds and credits to entities that are overcharged by participating manufacturers as well as enhancements to the Pricing Component of the 340B OPAIS whereby covered entities access 340B ceiling price information via a secure website to provide transparency of data to authorized users . The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Per f or mance Measur es HRSA measures 340B Program performance by two key metrics: numbers of covered entities and manufacturers audits. As of January 1, 2022, participation levels included 13,661 covered entities and 39,485 associated sites participating in the 340B Program, for a total of 53,146 registered sites.

Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreements/Contracts Program Description and Accomplishments The Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT) promotes the use of telehealth technologies for health care delivery, education, and health information services. OAT administers the followin g programs and activities: Telehealth Network Grant Program (TNGP) supports the use of telehealth networks to improve health care services for medically underserved populations in urban, rural, and frontier communities. More specifically, the networks: (a) expand access to, coordinate, and improve the quality of health care services; (b) improve and expand the training of health care providers; and/or (c) expand and improve the quality of health information available to health care providers, patients, and their families. This program funds different cohorts of grantees, usually with unique clinical or population focus areas, although grantees can also provide other clinical services in their projects. All TNGP grantee cohorts focus on using telehealth technology to expand access to services. In addition, the program conducts project evaluations to establish an evidence -base assessing the effectiveness of telehealth care for patients, providers, and payers. TNGP grantees focus on improving access to health care services in rural and underserved communities. This cohort continues to focus on promoting rural Tele - emergency services by enhancing telehealth networks to deliver 24-hour Emergency Department consultation services via telehealth to rural providers without emergency care specialists. HRSA will support 30 continuation awards. Evidence -Based Direct to Consumer Telehealth Network Program increases access to healthcare services utilizing Direct to Consumer technologies. The EB -TNP for Direct to Consumer care is expected to enhance the existing health care infrastructure and increase access to care for underserved populations utilizing synchronous video visits and remote patient monitoring for primary focus areas such as behavioral health, primary care and acute care. The emphasis on data collection and research to further the telehealth 375 evidence base separates this program from other Telehealth Network Grants funded by HRSA. HRSA will support 11 continuation awards and 12 new awards. Telehealth Resource Center (TRC) Program provides expert and customizable telehealth technical assistance across the country. The TRCs provide training and support, disseminate information and research findings, promote effective collaboration, and foster the use of teleheal th technologies to provide health care information and education for providers who serve rural and medically underserved areas and populations. HRSA will support 12 regional and 2 national TRC continuation awards. Telehealth Center of Excellence program examines the efficacy of telehealth services in rural and urban areas and serves as a national clearinghouse for telehealth research and resources. HRSA will support 2 continuation awards. Telehealth Research Centers conduct policy-relevant, clinically infor med telehealth research to expand the evidence base and comprehensive evaluation of nationwide telehealth investments in rural areas and populations. As part of the research and evaluation, the Telehealth Research Centers will also work with Telehealth Net work Grant Program awardees, helping them quantify and analyze their results and preparing summaries and publications of TNGP's clinical impact. The evidence -based telehealth research center will assist rural health providers and decision -makers at the fed eral, state, and local levels by examining the impact of telehealth services in rural communities. HRSA will support 2 continuation awards. Licensure Portability Grant Program provides support to state professional licensing boards to carry out programs under which the boards cooperate to develop and implement state policies that will reduce statutory and regulatory barriers to telemedicine. HRSA will support 2 continuation awards. Telehealth Technology-Enabled Learning Program supports the connection of specialists at academic medical centers with primary care providers in rural, frontier, and underserved populations, providing evidence -based training and support to help them treat patients with complex conditions in their communities. HRSA will support 9 continuation awards. Telehealth Data Collection Infrastructure will track funding, projects, and data for telehealth services within HRSA. This project will utilize usable data solutions, policies, and procedures to increase quality and standards of t elehealth data. HRSA will support 1 contract award. Telehealth.HHS.gov Promotional Campaign will allow for continuation of rapid dissemination of critical telehealth resources for patients and providers through the Telehealth.HHS.gov website, which was initially funded through the CARES Act. HRSA continues to provide important up-to -date telehealth resources for the public and has expanded the site to include a research section that links HHS -supported telehealth research studies that can serve as HHS's telehealth research gateway. The promotional campaign will support the continual utilization of the website as a key telehealth resource during the pandemic and beyond.

Congress authorized use of the funds for capital acquisitions necessary for the operation of the Department, specifically infor mation technology (IT) and facilities infrastructure acquisitions. Since FY 2016, HRSA has requested $144.51 million from the NEF and received $81.90 million. Program De scription In FY 2021 HRSA received $3.7 million in funding for three NEF projects. The first project was for modernizing the HRSA Data Warehouse by reengineering the back-end database architecture to provide a more modern, consolidated and streamlined database design. The second project is enhancing HRSA's Injury Compensation System (ICS) b y modernizing its financial management capabilities and improving security, data protection, accuracy, efficiency, and internal controls within program operations. The final project will build enhanced data analytics capabilities that will provide HRSA mor e robust business intelligence to enhance program decision-making and reporting. In FY 2022 HRSA received $11.79 million in funding for seven new projects, including the Rural Health Data Solution implementation with a two-phase implementation. Phase one c onsists of an assessment of the current state of rural health data within the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) and across HHS. Phase two begins in FY 2023 and will expand access to Advanced Data Analytics & Tools and build upon the existing Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) datasets as well as analysis tools developed as part of the FY 2019 NEF project B HW Data Management Initiative. The other non-OIT specific project is the Budget Planning & Description380 Development System, which will develop an automated platform for HRSA's budget planning and financial management processes and deliverables. There are four OIT specific projects planned in FY 2022. The first project is the HRSA SharePoint Cloud Migration that will complete the migration of existing on-prem ise SharePoint platform to a secure and efficient cloud environment. The second project is the Enterprise Site Repositories (ESR) which will modernize and cloud-enable the existing legacy implementation of ESR as well as scale the adoption across multiple HRSA programs . The next project is the HRSA Data Warehouse (HDW ) Data Enrichment & Security. With the help of NEF HRSA will further the moderniz ation and enrichment of the HRSA Data Warehouse website with program data, usability improvements, and critical security upgrades . The final OIT specific project is Network Infrastructure Refresh , which will allow HRSA to upgrade its network infrastructure to ensure HRSA staff can securely and reliably connect to network resource, make phone calls, and utilize prin t services. Program Accomplishments NEF resources have allowed HRSA to make critical capital investments in information technology that modernize and secure HRSA's systems and improve the effectiveness of agency operations and the utilizat ion of data ac ross HRSA. The BHW Management Information System Solution (BMISS) Platform Migration to Cloud was awarded in two phases (notification 6) using FY 2019 and FY 2020 NEF funding. The first phase allowed for the design and developed migration plan for the BMI SS Platform , addressed how PII would be protected throughout migration, established and configured a Cloud infrastructure for the BMISS Platform that aligned with HRSA OIT provided Microsoft Azure environment, developed a Data Migration Strategy and Data D eployment Strategy, provided the methodology for moving data to the test environments and addressing how production data will be moved, and identified DevSecOps tools and processes to support development in the Cloud environment. Phase two allowed for the purchase of necessary software, virtual machines, Azure agents, and other required items . At the end of the project in January 2021, HRSA successfully migrated the BMISS Platform to the HRSA OIT provided Microsoft Azure environment. With funds for the HRSA Cybersecurity and Data Warehouse Modernization (notification 5) project, HRSA replaced over 300 static legacy reports with ten interactive dashboards, giving the public easier ways to answer questions about HRSA programs. HRSA placed the dashboards on the new https://data.hrsa.gov website with a streamlined, mobile friendly, intuitive design. HRSA saw a 33% growth in return users after the site went live and a 162% increase in the number of files downloaded. HRSA OIT modernized the agency's outdated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to the latest ESRI platform, re -designed several GIS applications, and added new self -service data analysis and mapping capabilities. The new platform enabled HRSA to rapidly develop new web-based GIS prototypes and applications for both internal and external uses. HRSA also implemented mobile -friendly versions of https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov and https: //findhivcare.hrsa.gov , used over two million times annually by the public to find nearby health services. 381 HRSA Security Operations Upgrades (B1) (notification 6) has allowed HRSA to implement a comprehensive Trust but Verify vul nerability scanning and management program that allows all of HRSA's development teams to perform various levels of scanning while they code. This has greatly shortened the release cycle in support of agile development and produced secure code and the number of vulnerabilities discovered just prior to relea se have dropped significantly. Finally, NEF has allowed HRSA to modernize the Intrusion Detection/Prevention system (IDS/IPS) and the EDR system. The modernization provides for more automation, fewer false positives and a more robust layer of security. HRSA continues to make critical upgrades to its cybersecurity infrastructure (Notifications #4A, 5, 6 and 7), including implementing new cybersecurity tools and enhanced authentication practices for HRSA s ystems users. These cybersecurity investments increase the effectiveness of HRSA's technology infrastructure safeguards that protect valuable data and information systems, while supporting standards and requirements set forth by various federal agencies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Homeland Security. Budget Allocation FY 2023 In FY 2023 HRSA will receive $41.94 million in NEF funding for four projects : Tenant Improvement Expense for the National Hansen's Disease Program Lab Research : The lease for the program expires in 2022.

Subsequently in FY 2020, HRSA found that 36 health centers were unable to demonstrate sufficient progress to merit continuing their AIMS awards, resulting in a $2.0 million total reduction in drug control funding. For FY 2021, HRSA found that 63 health centers were unable Resource408 to demonstrate sufficient progress to merit continuing their SUD -MH awards, resulting in a $3.0 million tot al reduction in drug control funding. The remaining $540.0 million in ongoing supplemental SUD/MH funding initiated in prior fiscal years and incorporated in annual health center continuation awards is scored as drug control funding. National Health Serv ice C orps SUD Workforce Program Funds are used to provide loan repayment assistance to reduce the educational financial debt of qualified SUD providers in exchange for service at SUD treatment facilities in underserved areas. Funds reflect the portion of National Health Service Corps (NHSC) discretionary budget requests dedicated to the SUD Workforce Loan Repayment Program. As these funds support providers of SUD treatment services, 100 percent of the amount is scored as treatment funding. Addiction Medici ne Fe l lowship (AMF) Program Funds are used to support the clinical training of addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry physicians in underserved, community-based settings. Funds reflect the portion of Behavioral Health Workforce budget line requests dedicated to the AMF program. As these funds support providers of SUD treatment services 100% of the amount is scored as treatment funding. Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery (STAR) Loan Repayment Program Funds are used to provide loan repayment as sistance to reduce the educational financial debt of qualified SUD providers in exchange for service at SUD treatment facilities in underserved areas. Funds reflect the portion of Behavioral Health Workforce budget line requests dedicated to the STAR Loan Repayment Program. As these funds support providers of SUD treatment services 100 percent of the amount is scored as treatment funding. Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) The allocation of funds for the Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) is through competitive grants and cooperative agreements. The entirety of these programs is scored as drug control funding. The prevention-treatment split for FY 2021 was revised to match the programs funded based on the enacted budget. The FY 2022 prevention-treatment splits were revised to account for the Continuing Resolution which is $55.0 million below the FY 2022 President's Budget. The FY 2023 prevention-treatment splits was revised to account for the Budget Request that is $55.0 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution. 409 BUDGET SUMMARY The drug control budget for the Health Resources and Services Administration for the FY 2023 President's Budget Request is $922.0 million, which is $127.0 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution. He alth nte r Program FY 2023 President's Budget Request: $540.0 million (level with the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution) In FY 2023, the Health Center Program plans to support approximately 1,400 grantees and provide primary health care s ervices to nearly 30 million patients at the Budget Request level, including access to ongoing SUD services. Health centers will continue to provide SUD services for all age groups. In FY 2019, the Health Center Program awarded $201 million in new SUD/MH ongoing annual awards. The FY 2020 and FY 2021 Health Center Program enacted levels, the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level and the FY 2023 Budget Request level include no additional targeted drug resources. As a result, the reported amount of estimate d drug resources for FY 2019 and FY 2020, and those projected for FY 2021 through FY 2023, reflect the ongoing annual SUD/MH awards initiated in FY 2016 through FY 2019, health center continuation awards made in FY 2020 and FY 2021, and projections for FY 2022 through FY 2023. National Health Service Corps SUD Program FY 2023 President's Budget Request: $165.0 million ($60.0 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution) Funding has been appropriated to the NHSC for the express purpose of expanding and improving access to quality opioid and SUD treatment in rural and underserved areas nationwide. The primary purpose of this dedicated funding is to expand the availability of SUD treatment providers to include the SUD workforce and categories for outpatient services, including Opioid Treatment Programs, Office -based Opioid Treatment Facilities, and Non-opioid Outpatient SUD facilities. The funding supports the recruitment and retention of health professionals needed in underserved areas to provide e vidence -based SUD treatment and prevent overdose deaths. Providers receive loan repayment assistance to reduce their educational financial debt in exchange for service at SUD treatment facilities. Addiction Medicine Fellowship (AMF) Program FY 2023 Pr esident's Budget Request: $24.0 million (level with the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution) The AMF program seeks to increase the number of board certified addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry specialists trained in providing interprofessional behavior al health services, 410 including OUD and SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery services, in underserved, community-based settings. The AMF Program is designed to foster robust community-based clinical training of addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry physicians in underserved, community-based settings who see patients at various access points of care and provide addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery services across healthcare sectors. Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery (STAR) Loan Re payment Program (LRP) FY 2023 President's Budget Request: $28.0 million ($12.0 million above the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution) The Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery (STAR) Loan Repayment Program (LRP) provides for the repayment of educational loans for individuals working in a full -time SUD treatment job that involves direct patient care in either a mental Health Professional Shortage Area or a county where the overdose death rate exceeds the national average. The STAR LRP complements the NHSC SUD Workforce LRP as it is able to award loan repayment to more provider types and at a broader range of site types that those that are eligible for the NHSC SUD Workforce LRP. In FY 2023, STAR LRP participants will be fulfilling part of their requir ed SUD treatment service commitments, and HRSA anticipates making 112 awards with approximately $28 million in funding. Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) FY 2023 President's ($55.0 million the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution) The Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) initiative aims to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with substance use disorder (SUD), including opioid use disorder (OUD), in high need rural communities by establ ishing, expanding, and sustaining prevention, treatment, and recovery services at the county, state, and/or regional levels. Since RCORP's inception in FY 2018, the program has invested over $404.0 million in grants and technical assistance to rural commu nities serving more than 1,500 counties across 47 states and two territories. The most recent full -year of performance measurement data collection shows that a cohort of FY 2019 RCORP grantees provided direct SUD/OUD prevention, treatment, and recovery ser vices to 366,871 rural residents, and ensured that 23,605 rural residents received medication assisted treatment (MAT) services. HRSA supports the following grant and cooperative agreement programs through RCORP: RCORP -Implementation provides multi -year support to rural communities to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with SUD/OUD by establishing and/or expanding SUD/OUD services. The core/required activities of this program include, but are not limited to, naloxone training, distribution, and administration; identifying and screening at risk individuals for SUD/OUD and referring them to harm reduction services, treatment, and other support services; building the workforce and infrastructure to 411 support evidence -based Medication -Assisted Treatm ent (MAT) provision; and expanding the peer recovery workforce and recovery support services. These activities align with Administration Priorities. The Implementation grants that HRSA fully funded in FY 2021 and FY 2022 will remain active in FY 2023. HRS A anticipates recompeting RCORP - Implementation in FY 2025, when the FY 2022 cohort's period of performance has ended. HRSA does not anticipate recompeting this program in FY 2023. RCORP -Beha vioral Health Care Support provides support to rural communities t o respond to new and ongoing behavioral health needs of rural residents at risk for, or diagnosed with, SUD/OUD and/or co-occurring disorders. The program focuses on building the infrastructural capacity of rural communities to deliver behavioral health, including SUD/OUD, services across the continuum; enhancing care coordination to provide effective care; and addressing social determinants of health to promote health equity. In FY 2023, HRSA will support the continuation of grants awarded in FY 2022. RCORP -Rura l Centers of Excellence on Substance Use Disorders support the dissemination of best practices related to the treatment for and prevention of substance use disorders within rural communities, with a focus on the current opioid crisis. HRSA will re compete these cooperative agreements in FY 2023. RCORP -Techni cal Assistance and Evaluation provide technical assistance and evaluation support encompassing the entire RCORP initiative . HRSA will support the continuation of funding for one initiative -wide technical assistance cooperative agreement in FY 2023. HRSA will also recompete the RCORP initiative -wide evaluation cooperative agreement in FY 2023. Rural Be havioral He alth Workforce Ce nte rs develop and implement training and mentorship programs that build the capacity of rural health care providers, paraprofessionals, non-clinical staff, and community members to care for individuals with behavioral health, including SUD/OUD, needs in rural locations within the Northern Border Regional Commission. HRSA will continue funding these cooperative agreements in FY 2023. In FY 2023, HRSA will continue to invest in initiatives and support evidence -based s trategies that address the specific substance use disorder issues and behavioral health services needs in rural communities. The FY 2023 Budget Request will fund new and continuing grants and cooperative agreements for RCORP to strengthen the infrastructure and capacity within rural communities at high risk for substance use disorders (SUDs) and provide needed pr evention, treatment, and recovery services to rural residents. This request will also enable HRSA to continue expanding RCORP's focus to include other, emergent behavioral health needs in rural communities. In FY 2022, HRSA piloted a new program \u2014RCORP-Beh avioral Health Support --targeting rural individuals with SUD/OUD 412 and/or co-occurring disorders, in recognition of the fact that about half of those who experience an SUD during their lifetime will also experience a mental illness, and vice versa.336 In FY 2023, HRSA plans to continue funding for the FY 2022 behavioral health pilot program, existing cooperative agreements that provide needed technical assistance, evaluation, and workforce development support, a new pilot program allowing rural communiti es to increase access to medication -assisted treatment and training for MAT providers, and a tribal -focused behavioral health care support grant program. HRSA will continue to solicit feedback from rural stakeholders and engage and partner with other Fede ral agencies to promote a coordinated approach to combatting this devastating epidemic and ensure HRSA's efforts are aligned with Administration priorities. Finally, this request will enable HRSA to strengthen RCORP's commitment to reducing disparities in health outcomes and access among vulnerable populations. Beginning in FY 2021, new RCORP recipients are required to produce a Disparities Impact Statement during the course of their grant to enable them to monitor and assess the impact their programs have on vulnerable populations within their service areas. In accordance with Executive Order 13985, RCORP programs will continue to emphasize consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong t o underserved communities that have been denied such treatment. EQUITY Health Center Program The health center model of care uniquely positions health centers to address health disparities and advance health equity. As community-based and patient -direct ed organizations, health centers ensure access to affordable, quality, and cost -effective primary health care to the nation's underserved and most socially vulnerable populations. Nearly 1,400 HRSA -funded health centers operate over 14,000 sites, providing comprehensive primary and preventive care on a sliding fee scale to nearly 30 million patients each year. Approximately 91% of health center patients are individuals or families living at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines and over 62% of hea lth center patients are racial/ethnic minorities. Health centers also serve nearly 1 million agricultural workers, about 1.3 million individuals experiencing homelessness, and approximately 5.2 million individuals living in or near public housing. In addition to ensuring access to primary and preventive care, health centers' model of care includes the provision of non-clinical enabling services, including translation, transportation, outreach and education, care coordination, and eligibility assistance, t hat recognize and help to address the social and environmental barriers to health and to health care experienced by their patients. 336 Health Service Corps SUD Workforce Program The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Workforce Loan Repayment Program (LRP) has worked to increase access to evidence-based SUD treatment to communities in need. Providers recognized through this program are dedicated to caring for underserved communities in urban, rural, and tribal areas. Each NHSC clinician serves patients in Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) - communities with limited access to health care. In addition, the NHSC SUD Workforce LRP clinicians work at NHSC -approved SUD treatment facilities that have implemented a Slid ing Fee Discount Program that enables the site to offer services to patients regardless of their ability to pay. Addiction Medicine Fellowship (AMF) Program The AMF program aims to improve equity by improving the health of the underserved and connecting skilled professional to communities in need. Awardees are to collaborate and establish relationships with underserved, community-based settings. Within these settings, the addiction medicine/addiction psychiatry fellows are to practice knowledge and skills acquired in the treatment of the populations served by the facility during a clinical rotation. They may also complete a clinical rotation at a community -based setting that specializes in the treatment of infants, children, adolescents, or pregnant or postpartum women where they are also practicing the knowledge and skills acquired. Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery (STAR) Loan Repayment Program The Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery (STAR) Loan Repayment Program (LRP) aims to imp rove equity by reducing the barriers to access to substance use disorder (SUD), including opioid treatment and recovery services. The workforce supported through this program work in both mental Health Professional Shortage Areas and areas where the drug overdose mortality rates are above the national average. The STAR LRP also recognizes SUD support services provided by behavioral health paraprofessionals as an eligible provider types and new community-based settings (e.g. faith-based settings, crisis man agement centers, etc.) as eligible access points for treatment or recovery services. Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) RCORP addresses the disproportionate challenges rural communities face in accessing behavioral health care services, which include limited workforce, transportation barriers, and stigma, through community-based grants and technical assistance. RCORP funding also targets behavioral health care disparities within rural communities. For example, this budget request for FY 2023 includes funding for an RCORP -Tribal Behavioral Health Support pilot grant program that will allow HRSA to target specific funding to rural Tribal communities. Additionally, applicants to RCORP programs are encouraged to include populations that have hi storically suffered from poorer health outcomes, health disparities, and other inequities as compared to the rest of the population. Examples of these populations include, but are not limited to: racial and ethnic minorities, people who are pregnant, adole scents and youth, LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, etc. Since FY 2021, RCORP recipients have been required to produce a Disparities Impact Statement 414 during the course of their grant to enable them to monitor and assess the impact their programs have on vulnerable populations within their service areas. In accordance with Executive Order 13985, RCORP programs will continue to emphasize consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment. 415 Significant Items TAB 416 SIGNIFICANT ITEMS FOR INCLUSION IN L -HHS APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE FY 2023 CONGRESSIONAL J USTIFICATION HOUS E REPORT 117 -96 (July 19, 2021) 1) Alcee L. Hastings Program for Advanced Cancer Screening in Underserved Communities. \u2014The Committee is extremely concerned about the disparity in cancer screening \u2014and corresponding higher levels of cancer inci dence and adverse outcomes \u2014 in medically underserved communities. Several studies have demonstrated that this problem has only been made worse by the pandemic. The Committee includes $25,000,000 to fund Health Centers to increase access and address barriers to cancer screening, including patient education, case management, outreach, and other enabling services. Grantees must partner and coordinate closely with NCI -designated cancer centers to deploy cancer -center trained and super -vised outreach specialists and navigators to improve cancer screening and referrals among vulnerable populations in their catchment areas. (Page 46) Action to be Taken HRSA plans to administer programs identified and funded by Congress, as supported in the final FY 2022 Health Cente r Program appropriation, including the Alcee L. Hastings Program for Advanced Cancer Screening in Underserved Communities. 2) Health Center Dental Ser vices. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of Health Centers in providing comprehensive primary and preventive health services to the nation's underserved communities. Health Centers provide dental services for many who would otherwise face barriers to dental care. The Committee is aware that some Health Centers have partnered with Community Dental Health Coordinators (CDHCs) to provide patients with greater access to dental care. CDHCs provide community -based prevention, care coordination, and patient navigation to underserved populations in rural, urban, and Native American communities. The Committee encourages HRSA to work with Health Centers to expand their work in this area. (Page 47) Action to be Taken HRSA will continue to support the integration of dental services in the comprehensive primary and preventive health services provided by health centers to underserved communities. HRSA will also continue to encourage health centers to partner with Community Dental Health Coordinators as appropriate in their respective communities. 3) Health Center Mental Health Services for Children. \u2014The Committee is concerned about the many challenges faced by children in need of mental health services because of the COVID -19 pandemic. The pandemic has had serious impacts on children's mental, psychological, and emotional well -being, especially in low -income and minority commu nities. This impact will likely last for an extended period. The Committee strongly encourages HRSA to provide funding to Health Centers to support vital mental health services for children. (Page 47) Action to be Taken 417 HRSA will continue to provide funding to health centers to address the primary health care priorities in their respective communities, including the need for mental health services among children. 4) School -Based Health Centers (SBHCs) and Health Center Services at School -Based Sites. \u2014Recognizi ng the critical role of Health Centers as part of our nation's health care safety net, and that Health Centers providing services at sites located at schools within the communities they serve are currently one of the most effective sources of mental health care for children and adolescents, the Committee includes a total increase of $50,000,000 within the total for Health Centers to support the delivery of health care services at school -based sites. The Committee includes $25,000,000 to make grants to estab lish new school -based health centers and expand services at SBHCs pursuant to 42 USC 280h-5. SBHCs provide a convenient access point to high-quality, comprehensive primary health care, mental health services, preventive care, social services, and youth development to primarily children and adolescents from low -income families. The Committee also includes $25,000,000, an increase of $20,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level, for awards to Health Centers operating at school -based sites to increase their capacity to meet the increasing demand for health services, including mental health services. The Committee encourages HRSA to award grants to applicants that previously submitted fundable applications under HRSA -21-093 but that did not receive such funding. (Page 47) Action to be Taken HRSA plans to administer programs identified and funded by Congress in the final FY 2022 Health Center Program appropriation, including programs providing funding to support increased provision of health care services in school based health centers and health centers operating at school based sites. 5) HRSA Strategy to Address Intimate Partner Violence and Project Catalyst. \u2014The Committee includes no less than $2,000,000 for the HRSA Strategy to Address Intimate Partner Vio lence, an increase of $500,000 over the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee encourages HRSA to support training, technical assistance, and resource development to assist public health and health care profes sionals to better serve individuals and communities impacted by intimate partner violence. (Page 48) Actions to be Taken HRSA will continue to administer a strategy to address intimate partner violence in FY 2022, at a level supported by the final FY 2022 Health Center Program appropriation. 6) He alth Care e rs Opportunity Program (HCOP). \u2014The Committee includes $20,500,000 for HCOP, $5,500,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. The Committee notes t hat HCOPs assist students from minority and economically disadvantaged backgrounds navigate careers into the health professions. The Committee encourages HRSA to continue its 418 improvement of the diversity and distribution of needed health care professionals through the National HCOP Academies. (Page 51) Actions to be Taken In Academic Year 2020 -2021, HCOP grantees reached 3,535 disadvantaged trainees across the country, and partnered with nearly 200 training sites, including academic institutions, community-based organizations, and hospitals. A majority of these training sites were located in medically underserved communities and/or rural settings. The FY 2023 HCOP competition will broaden the Academies' capacity to support the recruitment, training, and retention of disadvantaged students in health and allied health professions programs. 7) Oral Health Training. \u2014The Committee includes $42,673,000 for Oral Health Training, $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget reque st. Within the total, the Committee includes not less than $14,000,000 for Pediatric Dentistry Programs, an increase of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level. The Committee directs HRSA to provide continuation funding for section 748 post - doctoral training grants initially awarded in fiscal year 2020 and dental faculty loan repayment program (DFLRP) grants initially awarded in fiscal years 2018 and 2021. The Committee directs HRSA to initiate a new pre-doctoral grant cycle, and to initiate a new DFLRP grant cycle with a preference for pediatric dentistry faculty supervising dental students or residents and providing clinical services in dental clinics located in dental schools, hospitals, and community-based affiliated sites. (Page 52) Actions to be Taken In FY 2022, HRSA published Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs), for the Predoctoral Training in General, Pediatric and Public Health Dentistry and Dental Hygiene, and the Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Program with a preference for pediatric dentistry faculty. HRSA also plans to provide continuation funding for the Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Program grants funded in FY 2018 and FY 2021 and for the 27 Postdoctoral Training in General, Pediatric and Public Health Dentistry grantees initially awarded in FY 2020. 8) Area Health Education Centers (AHEC). \u2014The Committee includes $50,000,000 for the AHEC program, an increase of $6,750,000 above the fiscal year 2021 level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program links university health sci ence centers with community health service delivery systems to provide education and training networks. The Committee encourages HRSA to support AHEC oral health projects that establish primary points of service and address the need to help patients find treatment outside of hospital emergency rooms. The Committee encourages HRSA to work with programs that have already been initiated by some State dental associations to refer emergency room patients to dental networks. (Page 52) Actions to be Taken HRSA wil l award the additional $6,750,000 proposed in the President's Budget and included in the House bill to existing AHECs to expand the AHEC Scholars Program, a longitudinal program with interdisciplinary curricula, including clinical, didactic, and community-based 419 training activities. This funding will improve access to community-based oral health providers by increasing access to care and the number of providers trained to deliver these services, with a particular focus on serving high-risk patients living in rural and underserved communities. 9) Graduate Psychology Education (GPE). \u2014Within the total for Mental and Behavioral Health Programs, the Committee includes $25,000,000, $6,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 20 22 budget request, for the interprofessional GPE Program to increase the number of health service psychologists trained to provide integrated services to high-need, underserved populations in rural and urban communities. The Committee recognizes the severe impact of COVID -19 on Americans' mental and behavioral health and urges HRSA to strengthen investments in the training of health service psychologists to help meet these demands. (Page 52) Actions to be Taken In FY 2022, the Graduate Psychology Education program ran a new competition to increase the number of doctoral health service psychologists trained in the provision of quality interdisciplinary, integrated behavioral health services to underserved populations in rural and urban communities. HRSA expa nded the requirement that trainees spend at least twenty - five (25) percent of the time in the experiential training site(s) in the delivery of not just OUD prevention, treatment and recovery services, but also to include other SUD prevention, treatment, an d recovery services as well. This change will increase the type of psychology programs and localities to be eligible for funding. In order to address the impact of COVID - 19, HRSA will promote technology integration as a part of psychological services and training programs. GPE grantees will utilize tele -behavioral health services and distance learning options to improve access to health services and address social determinants of health. Additionally, the FY 2022 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) incl uded a funding priority for programs that have demonstrated the ability to train psychology, psychiatry and social work professionals to work in integrated care settings. 10) Adolescent Addiction Medicine and Addiction Psychiatry Workforce. \u2014The Committee appla uds HRSA for issuing a funding solicitation for the Addiction Medicine Fellowship (AMF) program and the Mental and Substance Use Disorder Workforce Training Demonstration, as both programs will build the capacity of our nation's addiction medicine physicia n workforce. However, the Committee remains concerned by the lack of pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry expertise. Currently, there are insufficient opportunities to effectively train a robust mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) workforce. Only 75 of the nation's 179 accredited medical schools offer addiction medicine fellowships, and only one program focuses on fellowship opportunities for pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry. The Committee encourages HRSA to support fellowship programs focused on increasing the number of board certified pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry subspecialists. (Page 52) Actions to be Taken 420 HRSA will provide funding for 43 non-competing Addiction Medicine Fellowship continuation awards in FY 2023. One of the awards focuses on pediatric and adolescent addiction. HRSA anticipates graduating more than 63 fellows in FY 2023. In FY 2021, HRSA fully-funded five awards for the Integrated Substance Use Disorder Treatment Program totaling $11.6 million for a period of performance of 5 years. The awards expand the number of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, health service psychologists, and social workers trained to provi de mental health and SUD services in underserved community-based settings that integrate primary care and mental health and SUD services. 11) Registered Nurse Shortages. \u2014The Committee is concerned about current and projected shortages of registered nurses (RNs ) in the U.S. As discussed in the HRSA publication ''Supply and Demand Projections of the Nursing Workforce 2014- 2030'', California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Texas are projected to have a deficit of 10,000 or more full time equivalent RNs by 2030. The Committee directs HRSA to give priority in new funding announcements to public entities for training of additional RNs, specifically for acute care settings. In addition, the Committee directs HRSA to give priority to applicants in States listed by HRSA as having the greatest shortages. (Page 54) Actions to be Taken HRSA has several programs that address the current and projected shortages of registered nurses (RNs) in the U.S. In FY 2022, HRSA released the Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retenti on-Mobile Health Training Program to establish or expand nurse -led mobile units to provide care in rural and underserved areas; In FY 2022, HRSA released the annually-competed Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP) which will continue to increase the number of qualified nursing faculty nationwide. In FY 2022, HRSA continued funding for other Nursing Workforce Development Programs such as the Advanced Nursing Education Workforce Program, the Advanced Nursing Education Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners Program, the Advanced Nurse Education Nurse Practitioner Residency Programs, the Nurse Anesthetist Traineeship Program, the Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retention Simulation Education Training Program, the Nurse Education Practice, Quality and Retention Inte rprofessional Collaborative Practice Program: Behavioral Health Integration, and the Nurse Workforce Diversity Program. These programs focus on transforming nursing education and practice and preparing registered generalist nurses and advanced practice nurses to serve in rural, underserved areas, and high professional shortage areas. In addition, HRSA's Nurse Corps Programs provide scholarships to students pursuing a nursing degree and loan repayment support to licensed RNs and APRNs working at an eligible healthcare facility with a critical shortage of nurses. Approximately 50 percent of scholarship and 40 percent of loan repayment funds are reserved for RNs serving in Critical Shortage Facilities (CSFs), including acute care settings. The Nurse Corps wil l continue dedicating available funding to RNs in FY 2022, providing scholarships to nursing students and nurse faculty to train the future nursing workforce (supply) and loan repayment support 421 to RNs serving at CSFs who are dedicated to working in rural and underserved areas, while prioritizing healthcare facilities experiencing the greatest shortage of nurses. 12) Nurse Practitioner Optional Fellowship Program. \u2014The Committee provides $15,000,000, an increase of $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for grants to establish or expand community-based nurse practitioner residency and fellowship training programs that are accredited, or in the accreditation process, for practicing postgraduate nurse practitioners (NPs) in primary care or behavioral health, where supported education and training specialties will include family, adult family, adult -gerontology, pediatric, women's health care, nurse midwife, and psychiatric -mental health. The Committee directs HRS A to give preference to FQHCs, as defined by section 1861(aa)(4) of the Social Security Act. The Committee is concerned the Nation is unprepared for health care provider shortages and recognizes that postgraduate programs with this focus, integrating prima ry care and behavioral health, will help to address this problem. Patients need expert primary care and behavioral health providers prepared to manage the social and clinical complexities experienced in FQHCs. The program provides residency training and fe llowships to enable postgraduate NPs to transition to an integrated model of care consistent with current high standards of NP education and practice meeting the needs of our nation's most vulnerable populations. The events of 2020, from the global COVID -19 pandemic to national recognition of the severity of health disparities and health inequities in our country, has made this even more urgent. (Page 54) Actions to be Taken In FY 2020, HRSA funded 10 award recipients under the Advanced Nursing Education Nurse Practitioner Residency Integration Program (ANE -NPRIP). The purpose of ANE - NPRIP is to prepare new nurse practitioners (NPs) in primary care for practice in community-based settings through clinical and academic focused 12-month Nurse Practitioner Res idency (NPR) programs, with a preference for those projects that benefit rural or underserved populations. The goal is to increase the supply of and access to primary care and behavioral health providers in integrated community-based settings, while promoting the placement and retention of those providers in rural and underserved settings. The ANE -NPRIP focuses on Enhancement or Expansion of NP residency programs by funding applicants that have existing accredited NP residency programs (or are in the proce ss of NP residency accreditation), and includes a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) preference and behavioral health integration into primary care. Fifty percent of the award recipients are FQHCs, while 30 percent have FQHCs as practice partners, and 10 percent of the award recipients have a rural focus, while 30 percent partner with rural health clinics. The Program ANE -NPRIP. The program provides residency training and fellowships to enable postgraduate NPs to transition to an integrated model of care. NP specialties trained have a primary care focus and include Family, Psychiatric -Mental Health, Adult - Gerontology, Pediatric, Women's Health Care, and Nurse Midwife. In Academic Year 2020- 2021, the program trained 49 new NP graduates; 35 are Family NPs, while 14 are Psychiatric/Mental Health 422 In FY 2022, HRSA will fund non-competing continuation awards from the FY 2020 ANE -NPRIP cohort for their final project year. Program activities will continue to promote an increase of skilled NP provi ders in primary care community based settings that focus on care for rural and underserved populations. Some of these activities include behavioral health integration, cohort collaboration, academic clinical partnerships, curriculum development focusing on HHS/HRSA priorities and underserved populations, preceptor/faculty professional development, and NP residency sustainability. 13) Medical Student Education. \u2014The Committee includes $75,000,000, $25,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to support colleges of medicine at public universities located in the top quintile of States projected to have a primary care provider shortage. The Committee directs HRSA to give priority to applications from academic instituti ons located in States with the greatest number of Federally-recognized Tribes. The Committee also directs HRSA to give priority to applications from public universities with a demonstrated public -private partnership. (Page 56) Actions to be Taken In FY 2022, HRSA will fund ten non-competing continuation awards from the FY 2019 and FY 2020 cohorts. In addition, HRSA proposes to make ten supplemental awards to the ten grantees. 14) Congenital Syphilis. \u2014The Committee is concerned with the rise in congenital syphi lis as well as the need to expand efforts to prevent this disease and reduce infant mortality. To improve the quality of health care to mothers and their children, the Committee encourages MCHB to support efforts to increase prenatal screening for congenit al syphilis and postnatal follow -up for both mothers and babies to ensure that congenital syphilis is detected at the earliest possible stage. (Page 56) Actions to be Taken In FY 2022, HRSA will continue supporting efforts to prevent congenital syphilis. T he HRSA -funded Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI) Guidelines include a recommendation for counseling for sexually active adolescent and adult women at an increased risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including congenital syphilis. H RSA updated this guideline in 2021 to reflect current evidence and practices for screening women. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends early screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women. This recommendation is included in the WPSI clinical summary table, which provides a framework for incorporating preventive health services for women during well woman and routine health care visits. HSRA -funded programs, such as the Title V Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant and Healthy Start programs, also support efforts to increase prenatal screening as part of state and community-based strategies to improve health outcomes for women and children. The HRSA -funded Bright Futures guidelines includes screening for sexually transmi tted diseases, including syphilis, in adolescents. 423 15) Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant. \u2014The Committee recommends $868,700,000 for the MCH Block Grant, $156,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and $46,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. States use the MCH Block Grant to improve access to care for mothers, children, and their families; reduce infant mortality; provide pre - and post -natal care; support screening and health assessments for children; and provide systems of car e for children with special health care needs. The Committee recommends that HRSA continue to support MCH Block Grant partnerships with Federal and State partners to address gaps in services to mothers, children, and their families in all 50 States, the Di strict of Columbia, and the territories; including densely populated Medically Underserved Areas and Medically Underserved Population designated Health Professional Shortage Areas. (Page 56) Actions to be Taken In FY 2022, HRSA will continue to support the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant to states and jurisdictions. The State MCH Block Grant program awards formula grants to 59 states and jurisdictions, serving an estimated 60 million pregnant women, infants, and children, including children with special health care needs. The program gives states flexibility in meeting the unique health needs of their children and families, including those individuals residing in Medically Underserved Areas and Medically Underserved Population designated Health Professional Shortage Areas. 16) State Oral Health Programs. \u2014The Committee includes $250,000 to continue demonstration projects to increase the implementation of integrating oral health and primary care practice. The projects should model the core clinical oral health competencies for non-dental providers that HRSA published and initially tested in its 2014 report ''Integration of Oral Health and Primary Care Practice''. The Committee encourages the Chief Dental Officer to continue to play a key role in the des ign, monitoring, oversight, and implementation of these projects. (Page 57) Actions to be Taken In FY 2022, HRSA will continue support for the National Maternal and Child Consortium for Oral Health Systems Integration and Improvement program (COHSII) for t he Integrating Oral Health Care and Primary Care Learning Collaborative: A State and Local Partnership project with $250,000 in funding. This funding supports the continued provision of technical assistance, training, and other support for demonstration pr ojects. These projects aim to increase the implementation of oral health and primary care practice integration, and are modelled after the 2014 HRSA report, Integration of Oral Health and Primary Care Practice. HRSA is currently recruiting for a new CDO. 17) Children's Health and Development. \u2014There is increasing evidence that experiences in early childhood have long-term health consequences over the course of one's life. These experiences are critical in all areas of children's educational, social, and physical development and economic well -being. Children living in persistently high poverty experience more negative health outcomes. The Committee includes $3,500,000 to build upon the work done to address these challenges, and directs HRSA to fund projects 424 bringing systemic change, such as Statewide systems of early childhood developmental screenings and interventions, in States with high levels of or disparities in childhood poverty. The goal of the program is to yield comprehensive and integrated models for other States to utilize in improving child health and development outcomes. (Page 57) Actions to be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA awarded $3.5 million to the University of Mississippi Medical Center to support year five of the Early Childhood Developmental Health System Program. The Early Childhood Developmental Health System Program aims to improve population- leve l early childhood developmental health outcomes and reduce disparities in a state with significant risk factors for poor child health status. Since the project began in 2017, comprehensive developmental screening and service referral rates have increased, and health providers, early childhood service providers, and parents have improved their knowledge and capacity to promote developmental health. Through this program, HRSA has developed and promoted strategies that can be adapted for other states and communities, particularly those with high levels of childhood poverty. In FY 2022, HRSA will build upon this work by implementing and evaluating strategies to advance systems of early childhood developmental promotion, screenings, and interventions in multiple states with high poverty, and share findings nationally. 18) Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. \u2014The Committee includes $5,100,000, an increase of $4,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, for the National Fetal, Infant, and Child Death Review (FIDCR) program to expand support and technical assistance to States and tribal communities and improve the availability of d ata on sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUID). The Committee urges HRSA to consider making grants to support families who have experiences SUID by providing information, referrals, or peer or follow -up support services. (Page 59) Actions to be Taken In FY 2022, HRSA will expand support and technical assistance to states and tribal communities through continued support for the National Fetal, Infant, and Child Death Review (FICDR). The program was recently recompeted with an anticipated project start date in July 2022. The program aims to increase the capacity of community and state Child Death Review (CDR) and Fetal Infant Mortality Review (FIMR) teams to collect high - quality uniform data, translate data into action at the community, state, and national leve ls, including the availability of data on sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUID). The program also aims to expand fetal, infant, and child death reviews to additional states, territories and tribes. In addition, HRSA will implement a new program in FY 2022 to increase the capacity of pediatric providers to offer supportive services to families who have experienced SUID by: 1) providing training, information, educational materials, and resources to pediatric providers on providing bereavement support to families; and 2) making awards to professional community-based organizations/agencies to partner with local pediatric providers to provide bereavement education, counseling, and supportive services for families. 425 19) Sickle Cell Anemia Demonstration Program. \u2014The C ommittee includes $9,205,000 for this program, an increase of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. With the start of new five -year grant awards in fiscal year 2022, the Committee is interested in learning how the program is supporting the growth of comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) centers that provide the latest treatment options following evidence -based guidelines and have mechanisms to identify and serve patients with SCD, who are not currently being cared for by SCD specialists. The Committee directs HRSA to provide an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on its plans to meet these goals. (Page 59) Actions to be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA initiated a 5-year award cycle to fund five regional treatment demonstration programs (TDPs), through the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Demonstration Program. The TDPs improve outcomes of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their families by developing and supporting a regional SCD infrastructure that extends access to comprehensive services to individuals with SCD and their families throughout the region. While the TDP does not directly support one comprehensive SCD Center in the region, the TDPs collaborate with clinics or practices in at least seven states within a single region in order to develop and support comprehensive SCD care teams; implement telehealth technologies for health care delivery, education, and health information services; increase access to evidence-base d care and the latest treatment options; and collaborate and support care coordination within each region. TDPs work with local community-based organizations (CBOs), and will also work and collaborate closely with the 20 CBOs funded in FY 2021 through the Sickle Cell Disease Newborn Screening Follow -up Program, and five community health centers funded through the Hemoglobinopathies National Coordinating Center. Together, these partnerships will facilitate adoption and implementation of the latest evidence -based treatments, increase the number of patients with SCD receiving care by SCD specialists, and strengthen the system of care. 20) Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID). \u2014Within the total amount for Heritable Disorders, the Committee provides $4,000,000, a n increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request, to support wider implementation, education, and awareness of newborn screening and follow -up for SCID and other newborn screening disorders. The Comm ittee recognizes the progress that has been made in screening for SCID at birth to enable early interventions, including bone marrow transplantations and emerging investigational gene therapies. This work has been extremely beneficial to families who will soon have access to additional support with the launch of a virtual, facilitated caregiver support group this year. The Committee directs HRSA to continue supporting this and related work that focuses on helping families understand and navigate the process from diagnosis to treatment and follow -up and to expand access to these resources for providers and families of infants with SCID and other newborn screening disorders with a focus on reaching underserved populations. (Page 60) Actions to be Taken 426 In FY 2022, HRSA will continue to support newborn screening and follow -up for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) and other newborn screening disorders. The program works to ensure that newborns and children identified through newborn screening with SCID or other newborn screening disorders achieve the best possible outcomes. The program expands the ability of state public health agencies to provide screening, counseling and services to these newborns and children. The program also supports education, training and collaboration with clinicians, public health agencies and families to create a system of care that can assess and coordinate follow -up and treatment of SCID and other newborn screening disorders. Grantees create follow -up models that provide evidence -based/informed, condition-specific treatments and age-appropriate preventive care for infants and children with SCID or other newborn screening disorders, including using telehealth to link rural and medically underserved populations to knowledgeable clini cians, support, and resources. In addition, grantees collect and analyze long-term follow -up data to evaluate outcomes on infants with SCID and other newborn screening disorders. 21) Remote Blood Pressure Monitoring Initiative. \u2014Preeclampsia/eclampsia is the m ost dangerous form of hypertension that can develop during pregnancy or the postpartum period, affecting as many as one in twelve pregnancies and resulting in 15 percent of premature infant deaths. While new preeclampsia diagnostics are being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Committee understands that medical providers continue to rely on regular blood pressure monitoring to identify pregnant and postpartum people at highest risk of developing preeclampsia. The Committee also understands that preeclampsia disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities and those living in rural communities, and supports efforts to improve blood pressure monitoring for people lacking access to consistent prenatal care, particularly efforts to s upport remote blood pressure monitoring of pregnant people through use of blood pressure cuffs and easy-to - understand patient information to identify the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia and allow patients to proactively engage their health providers. The Committee urges the Healthy Start Program to work with States, health care providers, and nonprofit patient organizations to design and support an initiative that will strengthen remote blood pressure monitoring programs among high-risk vulnerable popula tions and communities. (Page 61) Actions to be Taken Regular blood pressure monitoring is essential to maternal and infant health. HRSA's Healthy Start Program has taken steps to support and improve blood pressure monitoring among its clients, which include high-risk vulnerable populations and communities. Through clinical support funds provided to grantees, Healthy Start awardees monitor and track clients' blood pressure, as well as provide and refer for follow -on care where appropriate. The purchase of and training on the use of remote blood pressure monitors is an allowable grant expense. 427 22) Screening and Treatment for Maternal Depression and Related Disorders State Grants. \u2014The Committee provides $10,000,000 for the Screening and Treatment of Maternal Depression and Related Behavioral Disorders Program (MDRBD), an increase of $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Maternal mental health (MMH) conditions are the most common pregnancy and postpartum complication; however, 75 percent of mothers go untreated. The COVID -19 pandemic has exacerbated maternal mental health conditions, with pregnant and new mothers experiencing anxiety and depression at a three to four times higher rate than prior to the pandemic. MDRBD trains health care providers to screen, assess, and treat for MMH conditions and provide specialized psychiatric consultation to assist the providers. The Committee directs HRSA to make grants to establish new State programs, and improve or maintain existing State programs. Grants shall include culturally competent approaches to assist in the reduction of maternal health inequities. The Committee recognizes the high need amongst States and directs MDRBD to provide technical assistance to n on-grantee States. (Page 62) Actions to be Taken In FY 2022, HRSA is planning a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) to make grants to establish new Screening and Treatment of Maternal Depression and Related Behavioral Disorders Program (MDRBD) State programs, and improve or maintain existing MDRBD State programs. HRSA will issue the NOFO in 2022 with an anticipated project start date in September 2022. Grants will include culturally and linguistically appropriate training and approaches to assist in the re duction of maternal health inequities. Technical assistance to non-grantee States will be available through HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Tele- Behavioral Health Programs Technical Assistance Innovation Center. 23) Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. \u2014The Committee recognizes that good oral health is an important component for improving the health and well-being of children and families. The Committee encourages HRSA to explore opportunities to facilitate linkages between the agency's Home Visiting Program and Community Dental Health Coordinators, where available. The Committee also encourages HRSA to work with oral health initiatives such as Community Dental Health Coordinators that have already been initiated by dental organizations to provide dental education, community-based prevention, care coordination, and patient navigation to children and vulnerable families. (Page 62) Actions to be Taken In FY 2022, HRSA continues to integrate oral health into the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program by requiring awardees to establish appropriate linkages and referral networks to community resources, as specified in statute. HRSA has initiated collection of additional data on whether children enrolled in home visiting programs have a usual source of dental care by 12 months of age. In FY 2021, approximately 66 percent of children 12 months or older enrolled in home visiting had a 428 usual source of dental care. HRSA continues to promote linkages with Community Dental Health Coordinators to MIECHV awardees, where available, and to the extent practicable. 24) Ryan White Part A Formula Disparities. \u2014The Committee directs HRSA to take action to revise and improve the funding formula disparities under Part A of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. Funding allocations utilized under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 are largely based on a formula which considers the place of residence of persons at the time of initial diagnosis when making formula -based grants. Under current law, if a person diagnosed with HIV in one area of the country moves to another part of the country, the funding for the case is not transferred to the new location. Therefore, the Committee directs HRSA to develop methods for calculating RWHAP formula funds to reflect the number of persons living with HIV in eligible jurisdictions, as well as other factors that reflect variability in funds and other resources. (Page 63) Actions to be Taken HRSA is exploring the feasibility of utilizing most recent address and other factors in both the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Part A base award and supplemental award. 25) Maximizing Deceased Donor Organ Recovery, Acceptance, and Utilization. \u2014The Committee supports swift implementation of the CMS final rule for Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) Conditions for Coverage (CMS -3380- F), including efforts to decertify underperforming OPOs. OPO failures are disproportionately borne by patients of color, which means OPO reform is an urgent health equity issue. The C ommittee believes swift and effective implementation of the Final Rule is a first step toward ensuring OPOs perform their public duties to secure more organs in an inclusive and equitable manner. The Committee supports regulatory and enforcement efforts to minimize excessive and frivolous expenses reimbursed by Medicare, including the CMS proposed rule on Medicare reimbursement for organ acquisition costs (CMS -1752-P). The Committee also encourages HHS to make all efforts to promote competition for the Orga n Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) contract, and to use the announced movement of the Division of Transplantation to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health to facilitate coordinated organ donation reforms. (Page 64) Actions to be Ta ken HRSA has always held full and open competitions for the OPTN contract. Since the last competition in 2018, HRSA has undertaken efforts to promote competition in future procurements. HRSA conducted market research on potential ways to modernize the OP TN IT system and published a Request for Information (RFI) in November 2019. The market research/RFI engaged industry on the possibilities for modern IT architecture to perform the primary functions of a national organ allocation system. HRSA held an \"Industry Day\" and responded to questions from interested offerors. HRSA also utilized the expertise of the U.S. Digital Services (USDS) to better understand the submissions received in response to the RFI. 429 26) 340B Drug Discount Program. \u2014The Committee is aware that in 2011, GAO issued a report outlining five recommendations for HRSA to improve performance and accountability within the 340B program. The Committee commends HRSA for implementing three of those recommendations and directs HRSA to report to the Commi ttee within 120 days of enactment of this Act on plans to implement the remaining two recommendations, which focus on clarifying eligibility criteria for 340B patients and providers. The Committee also directs GAO to update the 2011 report on the performan ce of the 340B program. (Page 66) Actions to be Taken The 340B Program spans the country and serves as a critical safety-net drug discount program that is an integral component of the success of the safety-net system in our country and has grown to nearly $40 billion in discounted drugs sales in 2020. While none of that amount is directly tied to taxpayer dollars, the growth of the Program has brought down the cost of prescription drugs in the safety net community to the tune of a 25 - 50% discount off the regular cost of the drugs. Despite the broad reach and impact of the Program, HRSA's regulatory authority in this area is limited. This has led to disputes over compliance and oversight in the Program as evidenced by ongoing litigation making this iss ue even more urgent. Court decisions completed have outlined the need for Congress to act in this space. While HRSA appreciates the work of the GAO in providing recommendations to improve the oversight of the 340B Program and as described in the President 's Budget for the past 6 years, HRSA does not have explicit regulatory authority to implement, further define or enforce most aspects of the 340B statute, including the compliance elements cited in the 2011 GAO Report. HRSA only has explicit regulatory authority in three areas of the 340B statute (ceiling price calculation, civil monetary penalties for manufacturers, and establishing an alternative dispute resolution process). Safety -net clinics and hospitals are foundational to our country's health syste m, focusing on our most vulnerable, underserved, and isolated patient populations and the pandemic has illustrated just how essential these providers are in serving those in need. Over the years, HRSA has received significant feedback from Congress urging HRSA to take action under the authority it has in the statute, which we have done to the fullest extent. However that authority is not sufficient. Legislative action is necessary to provide the kind of transparency, accountability, and oversight needed to ensure that the intent of the program is met to stretch scarce federal resources for safety net providers and the safety net has access to discounted drugs for their patients. 27) Urban Focused Telehealth Network Grant Program. \u2014The Committee believes that a fundamental element to ensuring our health care system is prepared for pandemic events is the development of robust telehealth services and integrated systems that can provide a continuum of care across State and regional lines. This is especially true in the nation's urban areas, where a pandemic event has the potential to disproportionately impact and overwhelm the health care and delivery system. The Committee believes increased 430 investments in urban telehealth services could have a tremendous impact on the health and well -being of the nation's most vulnerable citizens and medically underserved populations, especially during times of national public health emergencies. The Committee encourages HRSA to establish a pilot program to expand academic health syste m telehealth programs aimed at addressing the health inequities of urban populations. (Page 68) Actions to be Taken HRSA's Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT), through Section 330I of the Public Health Service Act, has the ability to fund telehealth networks in rural areas, frontier, communities, and medically underserved areas, and for medically underserved populations. 28) Rural Health Residency Program. \u2014The Committee includes $12,700,000 for the Rural Health Residency Program, an increase of $2,200,000 above the fiscal year 2021 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program funds physician residency training programs that support physician workforce expansion in rural areas. The COVID -19 pandemic has exacerbated the challenges in access to care faced by Americans in rural areas, particularly when they require specialty care. The Committee commends the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy for its efforts to expand the physician workforce in rural areas and supports continuation and expansion of the program to develop new rural residency programs, or Rural Training Tracks (RTTs). This Committee encourages HRSA to expand the current program to include RTTs in obstetrics and gynecology, as women in rural communities a re more likely to begin prenatal care late and are more likely to experience maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. The Committee requests a report in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on the progress made to date and efforts to expand RTTs in obstetrics and gynecology. (Page 69) Actions to be Taken HRSA recognizes the need for rural training in obstetrics and gynecology. Studies show that health care providers who train in rural areas are more likely to practice in rural ar eas. In FY 2020 HRSA issued a new Rural Residency Planning and Development (RRPD) program funding opportunity soliciting applications to start residency programs in family medicine, internal medicine, public health and general preventive medicine, psychiat ry, general surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology. From this competition, HRSA made awards in FY 2020 and FY 2021 to 20 organizations across 15 states to develop new rural residency programs in family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, and general s urgery. HRSA continues to investigate barriers to rural training in obstetrics and gynecology. HRSA has funded a study through its Rural Health Research Center Program to investigate barriers to providing rural obstetrical training for physicians. HRSA expects the results of this research to be available by the end of FY 2022. HRSA issued a new RRPD program funding opportunity for FY 2022 in October 2021 (HRSA-22-094) which was due in January 2022. HRSA plans to issue awards from this 431 competition on or before August 1, 2022. Eligible residency types for the FY 2022 funding opportunity are rural residency programs in family medicine, internal medicine, preventive medicine, psychiatry, general surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology. With this funding opportunity HRSA further emphasized obstetrics and gynecology as an eligible residency specialty and highlighted the importance of obstetrics training for rural physicians. 29) Telehealth Guidance. \u2014The Committee recognizes that the COVID -19 pandemic has increased the importance of access to telehealth services across the health care system, including for Title X providers and patients. The Committee urges the OPA to release telehealth guidance and best practices for Title X projects that reiterate the importance of telehealth in providing quality family planning services. (Page 70) Actions to be Taken OPA made available $35 million to support Title X telehealth enhancement and expansion for award in May 2022. The office anticipates releasing telehealth guidance, best practices, and training to its Title X grantees that reinforces the importance of telehealth, as a viable method for providing equitable access to quality family planning services to communities and individuals who may not otherwise receive these services throughout FY 2023. 30) Recommendations for Quality Family Planning Services. \u2014The Committee directs the Secretary to begin the process of revising ''Providing Quality Family Planning Services,'' evidence-based recommendations from the CDC and OPA that were las t updated in 2017. Revisions should incorporate new evidence and support holistic reproductive and sexual health needs. The Committee requests a briefing on the status of this process no later than 180 days of enactment of this Act. (Page 70) Actions to be Taken OPA anticipates revising the Quality Family Planning Services evidenced-based recommendations that were developed jointly with CDC. The revisions will incorporate new evidence and support holistic reproductive and sexual health needs through a heal th equity frame. To this end, OPA will conduct systematic reviews of the current and emerging reproductive and sexual health topics and lead a series of technical panel discussions about best practices and recommendations with experts in the field of sexual and reproductive health to inform the guidelines development. 31) Estimated Need f or Ser vices. \u2014The Committee requests the Secretary conduct a study, within 270 days of enactment of this Act, reflecting the current estimated need for Title X services and cos t required to provide such updating the 2016 study published in the American Journal of Public Health. (Page 70) Actions to be Taken OPA anticipates conducting an updated study which examines the current estimated need for Title X services and its associat ed costs. 432 32) HRSA Chief Dental Officer. \u2014The Committee is disturbed to learn that despite its directive in House Report (116- 450) to have HRSA ensure that the Chief Dental Officer (CDO) is functioning at an executive level authority with resources and staff to oversee and lead all oral health programs and initiatives across HRSA, no such authority has been delegated. The Committee directs HRSA to restore the authority of HRSA CDO with executive level authority and resources to oversee and lead HRSA dental progr ams and initiatives as well as have a role within oral health across the agency. The CDO is also expected to serve as the agency representative on oral health issues to international, national, State, and/or local government agencies, universities, and ora l health stakeholder organizations. The Committee requests an update as part of the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification on how the CDO is serving as the agency representative on oral health issues to international, national, State and/or local government agencies, universities, and oral health stakeholder organizations. (Page 70) Actions to be Taken In a recent reorganization, HRSA moved the CDO position into a new office under the Office of the Administrator, the Office of Special Health In itiatives (OSHI). OSHI provides a crosscutting focal point for HRSA to deliver on population health and Secretarial priorities, especially those that may be more clinical in nature. T he CDO position at HRSA is responsible for: coordinating oral health ac tivities across HRSA programs and advising HRSA oral health priorities throughout the various programs in the agency. Over the past year, specific activities have included: reviewing and advising on proposed oral health- related investments across the agency; representing the agency at professional conferences and meetings; providing presentations on the agency's oral health portfolio and key topics of interest to a variety of stakeholders; and developing and directing a cross -agency project to improve the oral health literacy of HRSA constituent populations. HRSA is currently recruiting for a new CDO. 33) Action for Dental Health. \u2014With the enactment of the Action for Dental Health Act of 2018, the Committee encourages HRSA to expand oral health grants for innovative programs under PHS Act Section 340G (42 USC Section 256g) to include Action for Dental Health activities. The Action for Dental Health program helps reduce barriers to dental care through oral health education, prevention, and the establishment of de ntal homes for underserved populations. (Page 71) Actions to be Taken In FY 2022, HRSA issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity for \"Grants to States to Support Oral Health Workforce Activities\". T he purpose of this program is to help States develop and implement innovative programs to address the dental workforce needs of designated dental health professional shortage areas (Dental HPSAs) in a manner appropriate to each State's individual needs. This NOFO expanded the allowable activities under the program to include the language from the Action for Dental Health Act of 2018. The estimated total program funding is $12.8 million; expected number of awards is 32; estimated award date is September 1, 2022. 433 34) Oral Health Literacy. \u2014The Committee includes $500,000 to continue the development of an oral health awareness and education campaign across relevant HRSA divisions, including the Health Centers Program, Oral Health Workforce, Maternal and Child Health, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, and Rural Health. The Commi ttee directs HRSA to identify oral health literacy strategies that are evidence-based and focused on oral health care prevention and education, including prevention of oral disease such as early childhood and other caries, periodontal disease, and oral cancer. The Committee urges HRSA to ensure that the Chief Dental Officer plays a key role in the design, monitoring, oversight, and implementation of this project. (Page 71) Actions to be Taken HRSA will launch an evidence -based oral health literacy campaign incorporating messaging around early detection, disease prevention, and oral health promotion by the end of FY 2022. The Chief Dental Officer will be involved in the design, planning, development and monitoring of an oral health awareness and education cam paign for health center patients, people living with HIV/AIDS, parents and children, and rural or underserved populations. 35) Targeted Investments in Impoverished Areas. \u2014The Committee supports targeted investments in impoverished areas, particularly in persis tent poverty counties and in other high-poverty census tracts. The Committee directs HRSA to develop and implement measures to increase the share of investments its programs in persistent poverty counties, high-poverty areas, and any other impoverished communities that HRSA determines to be appropriate areas to target. The Committee appreciates the report HRSA provided in response to the Committee's request in House Report 116- 450 and directs the Department to provide an update to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this Act on how HRSA is carrying out this directive. (Page 71) Actions to be Taken While some of HRSA's statutory authorities allow programs to target rural areas or medically underserved communities such as Health Professional Shortage Areas and Medically Underserved Areas/Populations, HRSA's current program authorities do not allow HRSA to limit competitive awards to locations in persistent poverty counties or other high- poverty census tracts. 36) Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Con ditions Awareness Act (P.L. 110 -374). \u2014 As a response to the growth in prenatal screening and testing, Congress passed this Act to ensure women receive ac-curate information on genetic testing, community support, and out-comes of care for their children when they receive a prenatal or postnatal diagnosis for Down syndrome or similar conditions. The Committee requests an update on the efforts to implement the Act in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification. (Page 94) Actions to be Taken HRSA ac knowledges the importance of accurate information on genetic testing, community support, timely screening and referral to services for children with Down syndrome and other 434 similar genetic conditions. HRSA supports these activities through a variety of programs, including the Regional Genetics Networks that provide health care professionals with education to assess and coordinate genetic testing, follow -up and treatment relating to genetic conditions by linking patients to genetic services. In addition, HRSA supports the Family-to - Family Health Information Centers (F2F HICs) Program. Each state has an F2F HIC that provides information, education, technical assistance, and peer support to families of children and youth with special health care needs, including those diagnosed with Down syndrome and other similar conditions, and the professionals who serve them. 435 Legislative Proposals TAB 436 Legislative Proposals 1. Expand HRSA's Rulemaking Authority for the 340B Drug Pricing Program and Establish Requirements f or the Use of Savings for Program Integrity HRSA is seeking to establish rulemaking authority and require covered entities to report both the 340B savings and their uses to HRSA. The 340B Program helps to ensure safety-net providers are able to provide ac cess to care to the vulnerable populations that they serve. The 340B Program was authorized by the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 and amended by sections 7101 and 7102 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148, as amended), which expanded eligibility for the 340B Program and significantly increased HHS's oversight responsibility and authority. Under the current law, HHS has explicit authority to regulate in only three areas; other areas are operated under guidance documents. The proposal would provide HRSA with general rulemaking authority to strengthen the 340B Program by allowing HRSA to issue binding and enforceable regulations for all aspects of the 340B Program. 2. Update HRSA's Health Center Construction Authority HRSA is seekin g to modify the authority for facility alteration, renovation, and construction grants for health centers. Currently, there are specific limits on how grant funding can be used, and this proposal would expand the potential uses and increase flexibility. The proposed modification of the authority would allow the use of funds for health centers to: 1) increase facility capacity to provide additional primary care services; 2) maintain current facilities; 3) improve or build new facilities that support evolvi ng face -to-face and virtual patient -centered care delivery models; and 4) build, improve, or modify facilities to support continuity of access to high quality primary care services for underserved and vulnerable populations during and after public health e mergencies and disasters. 3. Permanent extension of HRSA's Health Center Volunteer Health Professional (VHP) Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) Program HRSA is seeking to permanently extend the statutory authority for HRSA's Health Center VHP FTCA program (whic h is set to expire on October 1, 2022). The program supports health centers' ability to recruit and retain volunteer health professionals by providing federal liability protections. During the COVID -19 pandemic, VHP providers are a key resource in providing critical COVID -19 related services and general health care services that meet the needs of underserved populations. Health centers have recognized the value of maintaining and expanding their use of a volunteer workforce to better meet the preventive and primary health care needs of their patients. If FTCA coverage for VHPs ends, health centers will have to determine whether they can afford private malpractice insurance for their VHPs, or they would have to turn away these volunteer services. The los s of VHPs would negatively impact health centers' ability to provide primary health care services to underserved and vulnerable patient populations. 4. Update HRSA's Legislative Authority for the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth HRSA is seeking to update the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth's (OAT) legislative authority to include a broader focus to take on an advisory role to the HHS Secretary on policy, research, and programmatic activities. The proposed amendments to OAT's authorizing legis lation would formalize the office's policy role and provide more flexible 437 grant authority for OAT. Current legislative authority is program specific, with limited language focusing on coordination and outreach. These changes would update the statute to reflect OAT's current role and provide a more flexible grant authority to keep pace with changes in the telehealth environment. This proposal would strengthen HHS' overall efforts in improving access to health care for rural communities by strengthening policies, informing research, and targeting programmatic activities that seek to increase and expand util izat ion of telehealth services. 5. Improving HRSA's Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Data at the Client Level HRSA is seeking to modify the restriction on its ability to collect individua lly identifiable health information in the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. HRSA requests statutory authority to collect ZIP codes for residential addresses of clients in order to improve the agency's ability to analyze the resources available by the geographic location of clients, resulting in improved ability to assess and improve health equity. Collecting just this one variable will allow HRSA to conduct important public health analyses, while still protecting at the federal level the privacy and identity of people living with HIV. This proposal would allow HRSA to better understand where clients live versus where they receive HIV care and treatment and address disparities in HIV care and treatment by geographic location. 438 Vaccine Injury Compensation Program TAB439 VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM Table of Contents FY 2023 Budget Appropriation Language ....................................................................................................... 440 Amounts Available for Obligation ......................................................................................... 441 Budget Authority by Activity ................................................................................................ 442 Budget Authority by Object .................................................................................................. 442 Author izing Le gis lat ion ........................................................................................................ 442 Appropriation History Table ................................................................................................. 443 Vaccine Injury Compensation Program ................................................................................. 444 440 Appropriation Language VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM TRUST FUND For payments from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program Trust Fund (the ''Trust Fund''), such sums as may be necessary for claims associated with vaccine -related injury or death with respect to vaccines administered after September 30, 1988, pursuant to subtitle 2 of title XXI of the PHS Act, to remain available until e xpended: Provided , That for necessary administrative expenses, not to exceed $26,200,000 shall be available from the Trust Fund to the Secretary. 441 Amounts Available for Obligation Obligation FY 2021 Final FY 2022 Continuing Resolution Budget Discretionary Appropriation: $38,100,000 $38,100,000 $67,843,000 Transfer to Other Accounts -$11,200,000 Transfer Accounts $11,200,000 Subtotal, adjusted $38,100,000 $67,843,000 $251,343,000 $256,370,000 Transfer Accounts -$246,415,000 Transfer from Accounts $246,415,000 Subtotal, adjusted Mandatory Appropriation $246,415,000 $251,343,000 $256,3 442 by Activity Activity FY 021 Final FY 2022 Continuing Resolution FY 2023 2022 Continuing Resolution FY 2023 President's Budget (a) PHS Act, Title X XI, Subtitle 2, Parts A and D: Pre-FY 1989 Claims --- --- --- Post-FY 1989 Claims $246,415,000 443 Appropriation History Table (Pre-1988 Claims Appropriation) Ye ar Budget Estimate to Congress House Allowance Senate Allowance Appropriation 1996 110,000,000 110,000,000 110,000,000 110,000,000 1997 110,000,000 110,000,000 110,000,000 --- --- 1999 --- --- 100,000,000 100,000,000 2000 --- --- --- --- 2001 --- --- --- --- 2002 --- --- --- --- 2003 --- --- --- --- 2004 --- --- --- --- 2005 --- --- --- --- 2006 --- --- --- --- 2007 --- --- --- --- 2008 --- --- --- --- 2009 --- --- --- --- 2010 --- --- --- --- 2011 --- --- --- --- 2012 --- --- --- --- 2013 --- --- --- --- 2014 --- --- --- --- 2015 --- --- --- --- 2016 --- --- --- --- 2017 --- --- --- --- 2018 --- --- --- --- 2019 --- --- --- --- 2020 --- --- --- --- 2021 --- --- --- --- 2022 --- --- --- --- 2023 --- --- --- --- 444 Vaccine Injury Compensation Program FY 2021 Final FY 2022 19 32 +13 Authorizing Legislation - Public Health Service Act, Title XXI, Subtitle 2, Parts A and D, Sections 2110-19 and 2131-34, as amended by Public Law 114-255, Section 3093(c). FY 2023 Authorization...............................................................................Indefinite Allocation Method ............................................................................................................. Other Program Description and Accomplishments Serving as an alternative to the traditional tort system, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) compensates individuals or families of individuals, who have been injured by vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for routine administration to children or pregnant women. HRSA administers the VICP, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) represents HHS in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (Court), which ultimately decides to provide compensation or dismiss claims. HRSA receives claims requesting compensation for vaccine injuries or deaths, which the petitioner has served against the HHS Secretary and filed with the Court. HRSA medical officers with special expertise in pediatrics and adult medicine review these claims, including supporting documentation. HRSA also c ontracts with health care professionals for claim reviews and other medical specialists to provide independent claim reviews and testify in Court. HRSA medical officers develop preliminary recommendations regarding petitioner eligibility for compensation, and DOJ incorporates these recommendations in Rule 4(b) reports submitted to the Court. Lastly, HRSA processes payments to petitioners and their attorneys based on judgments entered by the Court. HRSA also publishes notices in the Federal Register listing each claim received and promulgates regulations to modify the Vaccine Injury Table that lists injuries and/or conditions associated with covered vaccines. HRSA provides administrative support to the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV), which is responsible for advising the HHS Secretary on issues related to VICP operations. The ACCV has nine voting members, including healthcare professionals, attorneys, parents or legal representatives of children who have suffered vaccine - related injuries or death, and non-voting HHS officials. Grant Awards445 Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund Congress annually appropriates funding from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund (Trust Fund) for VICP administration and compensates vaccine -related injury or death cl aims for covered vaccines administered on or after October 1, 1988. The Trust Fund has a current balance of over $4 billion. The Department of Treasury maintains the Trust Fund through a $0.75 excise tax on vaccines recommended by the CDC for routine administration to children or pregnant women. The excise tax applies to each disease prevented per vaccine dose. For example, the influenza vaccine is taxed $0.75 because it prevents one disease, while the measles - mumps -rubella vaccine, which prevents three diseases, is taxed $2.25. The Department of Treasury collects the excise taxes and manages Trust Fund investments. Petitioners include individuals, parents, or legal representatives/estates applying on behalf of others. Table 1 shows the number of petitioners awarded compensation and vaccine injury compensation provided over the last five years. Table 1. Growth in Families and Individuals Receiving Compensation Fiscal Year No. of Petitioners Compensation ($ in millions) 2016 claims have increased more than fivefold from 402 claims filed in FY 2012 to 2,057 claims filed in FY 2021 while the administrative funding has barely doubled from $6.5 mi llion to $11.2 million during the same period, as shown in Table 2. In FY 2017, HRSA began a backlog of vaccine injury claims awaiting medical review since the volume of claims exceeded the resources available to conduct medical reviews. The cumulative claims backlog was 966 claims at the end of FY 2020. Even though the HRSA funding to administer the VICP increased by $1 million from $10.2 in FY 2020 to $11.2 million in FY 2021, the backlog grew to 1,580 by the end of FY 2021, results in compensation del ays since claims are on the waiting list for about 13 months pending review. 446 Table 2. 10-Year Trend in Number of Claims Filed and Administrative Costs (dollars in millions) Fiscal Year Number of Claims Filed Administrative Funding 2012 401 $6.50 2013 504 $6.50 2014 claims in January 2021 due to ex pected implementation of th e final rule proposed to remove Shoulder Injury Related to V accine Administration (SIRV A) Funding History - VICP Claims Compensation Fiscal Year Amount FY VICP Request VICP Claims Compensation The FY 2023 Budget Estimate for the VICP Claims Compensation Program of $256.3 million is $5.0 million more that the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. This r equest will help provide adequate funds to compensate petitioners and pa y their attorneys' fees and costs. These funds will also allow the VICP to continue to meet its zero percent target for eligible claimants who opt to reject awards and elect to pursue civil action. Prior to the existence of the VICP, civil actions agains t vaccine manufacturers threatened to cause vaccine shortages and reduce vaccination rates. 447 VICP Administration The FY 2023 Budget Request for the VICP Administration Program of $26.2 million is $15.0 million more than the FY 2022 Continuing Resolution level. This request will support administrative expenses to process approximately 2,560 claims, which includes reducing the backlog by 480 claims or approximately 27 percent. This request will also support administrative expenses for medical review staff, con tractors to conduct medical reviews to reduce the backlog of claims, and medical experts for reviews and expert testimony to the Court. The funding request also covers costs associated with the claims award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

For FY 2023, the proposed target is 65% of claims with any medical records will be assigned for medica l review within 4 months of receipt from the Court. Adequate funding to conduct medical reviews of newly filed and backlog claims will help the VICP to meet or exceed this target. 449 Countermeasures Injury Compensation TAB 450 COUNTERMEASURES INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM Table of Contents FY 2023 Budget Appropriations Language ...................................................................................................... 451 Amounts Available for Obligation ......................................................................................... 451 Budget Authority by Activity ................................................................................................ 451 Author izing Le gis lat ion ........................................................................................................ 451 Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program .................................................................... 452 451 Appropriations Language COVE RED COUNTERMEASURE PROCESS FUND For carrying out section 319F -4 of the PHS Act, $15,000,000 shall remain available until expended.

A countermeasure is a vaccination, medication, device, or other item recommended to diagnose, prevent or treat a declared pandemic, epidemic or security threat. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (P REP Act) authorizes the CICP to provide medical and lost employment income benefits to certain individuals or estates of individuals who sustain covered serious physical injuries as the direct result of the administration or use of covered countermeasures. The CICP also provides death benefits to certain survivors of eligible deceased injured countermeasure recipients. PREP Act declarations identify the countermeasures covered by CICP.
