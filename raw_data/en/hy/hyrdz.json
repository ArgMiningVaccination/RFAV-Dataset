Dinne ll Environmental Torts Section Torts Branch, Ci vil Division I. Although underutilized, the FTCA's analogous private liability requirement is a key limitation on the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity. Those who litigate c laims unde r the Federal Tort Claims 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671 -2680 , awar e that the FT CA re quires analogous t ort liability agains t a \"private individ ual unde r like ci rcumstances.\" See 28 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2674 , 134 6(b) (2010 ). The Supreme Court identified this requirement as one of the six elements a claim m ust possess to fall within the FTCA's limited wa iver of sovere ign imm unity. See F.D.I .C. v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 47 1, 47 7 (1994 ) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)). The FTCA cise jurisdiction over: claims agains t the Un ited States, for money dam ages . . . for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the ir negli gent or wrongful act or omission . . . unde r circumstances wher e the Un ited States, if a pr ivate person, woul d be liable to the claima nt in accordance with the law of the place wher e the act or omissi on occurred. 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1 346(b)(1) (2010) (emphasis added). The statute also provides that: [t]he United States shall be liable, respecting th e provisi ons of this title relating to tort claims, in the same manne r and to the same e xtent as a private individual unde r like circumstances. 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 674 (2010) (emphasis added). Thus, if a private p erson under similar circumstances woul d not be liable to the plaintiff for the alleged con duct, a court does not have j urisdiction to adjudicate the FTCA cl aim. The only cl aims that fall within the purview o f the FTCA ar e those whe re a private p erson in like cir cumstan ces woul d be subject to liability. See United States v. Ols on, 546 U.S. 43 , 44 (2005). Desp ite the fact that this requirement is mentioned on two se parate occasions in the text of the FTCA as an explicit limit on the Ac t's waiver of sovere ign imm unity, it remains one of the statute's most misunde rstood and underutilized j urisdictional conditions. On e maj or difficulty wit h the proper application and use of the analogous pr ivate liability requirement rests in the language of the statute itself. The language in 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 346(b) and \u00a7 26 74 that sets forth the requirement i s not a model of clarity and may even be described as cryptic . The FTCA m entions the \"law of the place\" without JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 1defining what place it is referring to - whe ther it is referring to a federal, state, or local jurisdiction - and proceeds to rely on a \" like cir cumstan ces\" test, a vague st andard devoid of any con crete meani ng. Anot her difficulty arises from the requirement' s ultimate outcome. The FTCA m andates that an analogy be drawn be tween the Un ited States and a private person - two se emingly incongruent and incompara ble things. Fi nally, th e case law interpreting th e requirement ha s taken a number o f twists and turns since Congres s first passed the FT CA in the 1940s. In the end, the FTCA's analogous private liability requirement could be described as an awkward a nd counterintuitive jurisdictional prerequisite, but one that leaves ample r oom for both sides to make compell ing ar guments in FT CA cas es. Fortunately for t he FTCA li tigator , the analogous pr ivate liability requirement can prove to be a powe rful defensive wea pon when attempting to s ecure the dismissa l of tort claims brought a gains t the Un ited States. II. Early Supreme Court cases that analyzed the FTCA's analogous private liability requirement struggled to consistently address inherently governmental acts and omissions. How ca n the Un ited States be compare d with a private person for the purpose of measuring liability? Is it possible to find such an analogy where the government a ctivity at i ssue is far removed fr om the kind of conduct contemplat ed by privat e persons? Early FTCA c ases struggled with these fundamenta l questions in their interpretation of the FT CA's analogous private liability requirement. Nonet heless, one thing was made clear from the start - the FTCA m ust be treated as a limited waiver of sovere ign imm unity. Shor tly after the enactment o f the FTCA, th e Supreme Cou rt disabused any noti ons that the FTCA woul d assure damages f or all injuries caused by g overnment e mployees. See Feres v. Uni ted States, 340 U.S. 13 5 (1950 ) (holding the government n ot liable under the FT CA for injuries to servicemen ar ising out of or in the course of activity inci dent to mili tary ser vice) . In the seminal Feres case, the Supreme Court considered wh ether the Uni ted States could be held liable under the FT CA for the death of a serviceman ca used by a f ire in his barracks whi le he was on active dut y military servic e. Id. at 136, 145 -46 (considering th e Jefferson and Griggs cases wher e plaintiffs alleged t hey wer e entitled to damag es unde r the FTCA due to negli gent medic al treatment in connection wi th active dut y military service) . The Co urt stressed that the FT CA's own l anguage pr escribes the test of allowa ble claims, stating th at the Uni ted States can only be hel d liable \"in the same m anner and to the same ext ent as a private i ndividual under like cir cumstan ces.\" Id. at 141 (quoting 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 2674 ). The FTCA can not be read to create new cau ses of action; it merely acce pts liability unde r circumstan ces that woul d bring private l iability into existence. Id. In Feres, the Supreme Cou rt concluded that plaintiffs could not identify pri vate i ndividual liability tha t was even \"r emotel y anal ogous\" to the claims asserted agains t the Un ited States, stating it knew of no Ameri can law that ever a llowed a soldier to recover fo r negligenc e agains t either his superior officers or the government he was serving. \"Nor is there any lia bility 'unde r like ci rcumstances,' for no private i ndividual has powe r to conscript or mobilize a pr ivate army with s uch authorities over persons as the government vests in echelons of comm and.\" Id. at 141-42. T hus, the Cou rt found no parallel liability and stressed that the FT CA cr eated no new cau ses of action. Id. at 142 (holding th at the FT CA's effect is to \"wai ve im munity from recognized c auses of action and was not to visit the Go vernment wi th novel a nd unprecedented liabilities\"). It also considered the notion that, although the FTCA's \"law of the \"recognizes and assimilates into federal law the rules of substantive law of the several states,\" the relationship between the government a nd persons in service are funda mentally derived f rom fed eral sources and governed by fed eral authority. Id. at 144-46 (citations omitt ed) 2 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011(\"Without exception, the relationship of military pers onne l to the Go vernment ha s been governe d exclusively by fed eral law. We do n ot think that Congres s, in drafting thi s Act, created a new c ause of action dependent on local law for service- connected injuries or death due to negli gence.\" ) With this landmark deci sion, the Supreme Court suggeste d that claims agains t the government a rising fro m uniquely gov ernmental activity (m aintaining and c ommanding ar med forces) woul d fall victim to the FTCA's analogous private liability requirement. Three year s later, the Supreme Cou rt again considered the bound aries of the FT CA's limited waiver of sover eign im munity and affirmed th e reasoning under lying it s decision in Feres. See Dalehite v. Uni ted States, 346 U.S. 15 (1953) (affirming judgm ent in favor of the Uni ted States in an action consolidating ov er 300 suits under the FTCA for death, injuries, and damages re sulting fro m an explosion of amm onium nitrate fertilizer in Texas City, T exas). In Dale hite, the plaintiffs claimed th at the United States was negli gent i n a wide range of activity conduc ted by numerous government actors at vario us levels , from the government' s adoption of the over arching fer tilizer ex port plan to its manufacture and shipboa rd loading of t he fertilizer. Id. at 23-24. T he Supreme Court stressed: [t]he legisla the FTCA] de sired to waive the Government' s immunity from actions for injuries to person and property occasioned by the tortuous conduct of its agent s acting wit hin their scope of business, it was not contemplated that the Gover nment should be subject to liability arising fr om acts of a governmental nature or function. Id. at 27-28. T he Co urt explained that the FT CA's discretionary funct ion exception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680 (a), shields the government f rom cla ims involvin g \"act s of a governmenta l nature.\" wer i n the collective mind of Congres s\" in the passage of the FT CA). T he FTCA was not intended to permit \" suit[s] for damag es to test the vali dity of or provide a remedy on a ccount of discretionary acts ,\" even if negli gentl y performed. Id. at 30. Jurisdiction does not exist under the FTCA \"[ w]he re there is room for policy judgm ent and decision.\" Id. at 36. Although t he Co urt focused primarily on the FTCA's discretionary funct ion exception, it also considered the analogous pr ivate liability requirement in the context of the Coa st Guar d's alleged negli gent f ailure in fighting the fire. Addr essing th e fire fighting cla ims, th e Cou rt found no \"parallel liability\" an d noted that the FT CA's effect is only to wai ve im munity for recognized c auses of action, not to present the government wi th novel a nd unprecedented liabilities. Id. at 43. Spec ifically, th e Cou rt held that there was no a nalogous l iability for t hese claims and reasoned that \"if anythi ng is d octrinally sanctified in the law of torts it is the immunity of comm unities and other public bodies for injuries due to fightin g fire.\" Id. at 44 (analogizing th at \"cities, by maintaining fir e-fightin g organizat ions, assume no liability for personal injuries resulting fro m their lapses\"). The fact that the Cou rt looked to the immunity of municipalities and public bodies is noteworthy when you co nsider the \"private i ndividual \" language of the FTCA's analogous private liability requirement. In a way, Dale hite also eroded the distinction between the FT CA's discretionary funct ion exception and its analogous pr ivate liability requirement. The Cour t's discussion on how the exception shields \"acts of a governmenta l nature\" from li ability is eerily similar to its discussion regardi ng the Coas t Guard fire fighting cla ims and its discussion in Feres, explaining that no a nalogous pr ivate liability exi sts whe re uniquely gov ernmental conduct is involved. Dale hite, 346 U.S. a t 28, 44 ; Feres, 340 U.S. a t 135. Al though somewhat unavoidab le, the conflation of these two concepts - the discretionary funct ion exception and the analogous pr ivate liability requirement - only fur thered the lack of clarity surr ound ing ea ch respective pr ovisi on. JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 3Only 2 year s after Dale hite, the Cou rt took a dr amatic turn in Indian Towi ng Co . v. United States, 350 U.S. 61 (1955), wher e it revisi ted the FTCA and its analogous pr ivate liability requirement. In that case, a barge char terer brought an action under the FT CA for damages sus tained when a tug went agroun d, allegedly due to the Coa st Guar d's negli gent op eration of a lighth ouse. Id. at 61. T he Co urt held that the Coa st Guar d, ha ving under taken to provide l ighth ouse service, h ad a duty to use due care to make ce rtain that the lighth ouse was kept i n good wor king orde r, to discover an y failure of the light, an d to repair the light o r give a wa rning that it was not functioning. Id. at 69. Ultimatel y, the Cour t held that the FT CA's provisi on imposing li ability \"in the same m anner and to the same ext ent as a private i ndividual under like cir cumstan ces\" does not exclude liability in t he performance of activities whic h private persons do not perform. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674 (2010); 350 U.S. at 72. It also eradicated any distinction between governmental and non-governmental functions in terms of assessing FT CA li ability. This analysis stood in stark contr ast to Dale hite's treatment of the Coa st Guar d fire fighting cla ims as well as Feres' treatment of active duty m ilitary pers onne l. With its holding in Indian Towi ng, the Cou rt presaged t he future treatment of the FT CA's analogous private liability requirement. As the Co urt explained in Indian Towi ng, the government i n Dale hite contended that the private analogous liability requirement must be \"read as excluding li ability in the performance of activities whic h private persons do not perform.\" Indian Towi ng, 350 U.S. a t 64. Thus, no FTCA li ability for the negli gent pe rformance of \"uniquely governmenta l functions\" should exist. Id. The Co urt continued to explain that [t]he Government reads [the FTCA] a s if it imposed liability to t he same ext ent as woul d be imposed on a private i ndividual \"under the same cir cumstan ces.\" Bu t the statutory language is \"under like cir cumstan ces . . . .\" Id. Although t he Co urt did not squarely dec ide this issue, it noted the fact that the government' s reading of the FTCA woul d impose liability \"in t he same m anner as if it were a municipal corporation and not as if it were a private person.\" Id. at 65. The Co urt further stated that all governmenta l activity is inescapably \"uni quely gov ernmental\" in that it is performed by the government. However, the Cour t conceded that some li ability in this perceived ar ena is circumscribed by the exceptions to the FTCA contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680, including the discretionary funct ion exception. The Co urt found that neither Feres nor Dale hite could be considered applicable to the facts in Indian Towi ng. Id. at 69. Indian Towi ng sugg ested that uniquely gov ernmental conduct must fall within the discretionary funct ion exception to be expressly shie lded from li ability, ot herwise, such activity m ay be a nalogized to the most compara ble private person conduct and subjected to suit in tort. Id. 64-65, 68. In only hal f a decade, the notion advanc ed in Feres and Dale hite, whic h held that uniquely governmenta l functions fall outside the FTCA's analogous private liability requirement, had collapsed. In his dissent, Justice Reed discussed the obvious discord between the holding in Indian Towi ng and the Cou rt's prior holdings in Feres and Dale hite. Indian Towi ng, 350 U.S. a t 75 (\"In Feres we t alked of private l iability and ca me to a conclusion whi ch is contrary to that reached by the Cour t today.\") He stressed that the FT CA's analogous private liability requirement shaped the Cou rt's holding in Feres that the plaintiffs' claims fell outside the FT CA's jurisdictional bounds. Id. at 72. Justice Reed likened the lighthous e keepi ng duti es in Indian Towi ng to the responsibilities of the active duty se rvice members in Feres and the Coa st Guar d's fire-fightin g duti es in Dale hite. Id. at 74-75. He ar gued th at all were devoid of any pri vate a nalogue an d that lighthous e keepi ng is a s unique a governmental function as fire-fightin g and thus falls outside the scope of the FT CA's limited wa iver of sovere ign imm unity. Id. at 75. He further noted that 4 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011[t]here is at least some unc ertainty and ambiguit y as t o wha t Congress meant by making the United States liable in circumstances wher e it would be liable \"if [it was] a private person.\" That uncertainty shoul d not lead us to accept liability for the Uni ted States in this case. In dealing wit h this enlarged con cept of federal liability for t orts, wi sdom should dictate a cautious approach along the l ines of Feres and Dale hite. Id. The dissent also considered the fact that a munic ipal corporation wou ld not be responsible under similar facts pursuant to Lou isiana tort law. Id. at 75-76 (\"We can see no reason to doubt that under Loui siana law the maint enance of navigati if permissible, by unicipalities wou ld likewise be free of liability.\"). Ultimatel y, Justice Reed's dissent fell on d eaf ears. Just 2 year s after Indian Towi ng, the Cou rt revisited one of Dale hite's core issues, whet her the United States could be held liable under the FT CA for its alleged ne gligence in fightin g a fi re. In Rayo nier Inc. v. Uni ted States, 352 U.S. 31 5 (1957 ), the Co urt squarely deal t with whet her this presumably gov ernmental function could subject the Uni ted States to liability, not withstanding th e Cour t's holding in Dale hite. Id. In Rayo nier, plaintiffs sued the Un ited States for the alleged negli gence of government employees in allowing a fo rest fire to be started on government land in Washingto n state and in failing to exercise due care in putting out the fire. Id. at 315-16 (describing how th e Uni ted States Forest Service t ook exc lusive di rection and control of all fire suppression activities). The Co urt held that the United States may be l iable under the FT CA for its alleged ne gligence in fightin g the f orest fire, provided t hat state law imposes liability on pr ivate persons or corporations under similar circumstances. Id. at 318 (explaining that the FTCA's analogous private liability pro visio ns, \"given th eir plain natural meaning, m ake th e Uni ted States liable to [plaintiffs] for the Forest Service' s negligence in fightin g the forest fire if, as alleged in the complai nts, Washingto n law wou ld impose l iability on pri vate p ersons or corporations under similar circumstances.\"). Rel ying on it s recent holding in Indian Towi ng, the Cou rt stressed that the FT CA's test for determining the government's liability is specifically grounde d in whet her a private person woul d be responsible for simila r negligenc e under the laws of the state whe re the act or omission occurred. Id. at 319. Des pite the government' s argum ent to the contrary, th e Cou rt clarified that liability unde r the FTCA is not restricted to the liability of a munic ipal corporation or other public entity and t hat any al leged dis tinction between government actions in a proprietary capac ity versus a uniquely governmenta l capacity is not germ ane to the analysis. Id. at 318-19 (stating th at if \"there was anythi ng to t he contrary in the Dale hite case it was necessarily rejected by Indian Towi ng\"). This analysis refocused the analogous pr ivate liability requirement on the \"private i ndividual \" language of the FTCA. As the Supreme Court continued to refine the doctrine, it became cle ar that the FT CA wil l render the government liable in tort if a private i ndividual woul d be liable under similar circumstances, assuming th e plaintiff's claim does not fall within one of the FT CA's specific exceptions. See Richards v. United States, 369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962 ). In Richards, FTCA wron gful d eath claims were brought b y pers onal representatives of passengers kil led whe n an airplane, ope rated under federal regulat ion, took off in Oklahoma but crashed in Missouri. Id. The analogous pr ivate liability requirement demonst rates that the FTCA \"was not intended to operate with complet e independence of principles of law [that were] develo ped by comm on law an d refined by [s tate] statute and judicial decisions.\" Id. at 6. The Co urt further explained that the FT CA was designed t o build upon legal r elationships formulat ed and characterized b y the s tates. Id. at 5-6, 11 (holding th at a court in an FTCA act ion must refer to the wh ole law of the state in which the act or omissi on occurred). Thus, it characterized t he FTCA's \"law of the place\" language as r equiring cou rts to apply th e who le law of the state. By appl ying Ok lahoma's c onflict- of-laws d octrine, the Cour t turned to Missouri law and concluded that a Missouri limitation on compensa tion barred plaintiffs' wrongful death claims. Id. at 15-16. Gr adually, th e analogous pr ivate JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 5liability requirement became m ore about applying the law of the state wher e the act or omissi on occurred and less about assessing whet her the governmental conduct at issue was uniquely gov ernmental in nature. Later, in 1963, the Co urt further elucidated the analogous l iability requi rement. In United States v. Muniz, 374 U.S. 15 0, 15 1 (1963 ), the Co urt considered wh ether the government may be liable in an FTCA act ion brought b y fede ral prisoners to recover fo r personal injuries that were sustained during confinement a nd allegedly ca used by the negli gence o f federal prison employees. The Co urt held that the FTCA doe s not shield the government from suit in this case even t hough maint aining a pri son is inherently a governm ental function. Id. at 153-54. T he Co urt placed grea t emphasis on the legisl ative history of t he Ac t and the nature of the relationship between the government a nd the plaintiffs to conclude that \"Con gress intended to permit s uch suits.\" Id. This case may rep resent the last major stand for the prospect that a governmenta l activity falls outside the purvie w of the FT CA sol ely based on the analogous private liability requirement. The last stand failed. By all owin g this suit, the Co urt rejected the government's argument that Feres precluded such suits. Id. at 159-60 (stating an analogous form of liability exi sts in Muniz, wher e \"[a] number of States have all owed prisoners to recover fr om their jailers for negli gentl y cause d injuries and several States have all owed such recovery ag ainst themselves\" ). Feres was now t he last vesti ge of a n antiquated view o f the requirement. T he Co urt distingui shed Feres by emphasi zing the difference between the central relationships in each case. Id. at 162. Unl ike the government's role as an overse er in Muniz, the \"peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors\" in Feres warranted different treatment due to the \"effects of the maint enance of such suits on discipline . . . and the extreme res ults that might o btain if suits under the Tort Claims Act were allowed for negli gent or ders given or negli gent a cts committed in the course of military duty . . . .\" Id. (quoting United States v. Br own, 348 U.S. 11 0, 11 2 (1954 )). In explaining its decision, the Cou rt noted that one import ant consideration in allowing such suits unde r the FTCA is that the government i s still afforded the protections annou nced in the FTCA's discretionary funct ion and intentional torts exceptions. Id. at 163 (citing 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 2680 (a) and \u00a7 2680(h)). The FTCA's exceptions were to provide t he teeth once attributed to the analogous pr ivate liability requirement. The Co urt also clarified that state rules governi ng m unicipal imm unity from prison suits are of no mom ent in the FT CA's private analogous liability ana lysis. Id. at 164 (\"Just as we r efused to import the 'casuistries of municipal liability for torts' in Indian Towi ng, so we t hink it improper to limit suits by fed eral prisoners because of restrictive st ate rules of imm unity.\"). The private p erson analogue wa s here to stay. As the Co urt later explained, the FT CA re lies upon its discretionary funct ion exception to mark \"the bound ary betwe en Co ngress ' willingnes s to impose tort liability upon the Uni ted States and its desire to protect certain gov ernmental activities from exposure to suit . . . .\" United States v. Va rig Airlines, 467 U.S. 79 7, 80 8, 80 9-10 (1984 ) (citation omitted) (\"It is neither desirable nor intended that the constitutionality of legisla tion, the legali ty of regulat ions, or the propriety of a d iscretionary adminis trative ac t should be tested through the medium of a damag e suit for tort.\"). The days of relying on a distinction between governmental or non-governmental activity were at an end, regardl ess of whet her the distinction wa s premised upon the analogous pr ivate liability requirement or otherwise. Nonet heless, even i n Varig, the government ha d pressed the argum ent that the condu ct of the FAA i n certificating ai rcraft was \"a core governmental activity tha t is not actionable under the Act , because no private i ndividual engages i n analogous a ctivity.\" Id. at 816. Although r esponde nts maintained this argument was precluded by the Cour t's ruling in Indian Towi ng, the Cou rt ultimately found it unne cessary to ad dress this issue, instead basing it s ruling upon t he discretionary funct ion exception. Judicial intervent ion in such decisionmak ing th rough pri vate t ort suits woul d require the courts to \"second-guess\" the political, social, and economic j udgm ents of an agency exe rcising it s regulat ory 6 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011function. It was precisely this sort of judicial intervent ion in policymaking tha t the discretionary funct ion exception was designed t o prevent. See Id. at 820. The perceived rol e attributed to the analogous pr ivate liability requirement in Feres and Dale hite was destined to be carried by the d iscretionary funct ion exception. III. In Olson, the Supreme Court made clear that the \"private person\" standard governs whether or not there is analogous private liability. In Olson, the Supreme Cou rt considered the FTCA cl aims of injured miner s who alleged negli gence o n the part of inspectors from the Mine Safety and Hea lth Adminis tration. United States v. Olson, 546 U.S. 43 (2005). The Co urt extingui shed any doubt regardi ng the nature of the analogous private l iability requi rement and held that the FT CA wai ves sover eign im munity onl y where local law woul d mak e a private person, not a state or municipal entity, lia ble - even wher e uniquely governmenta l functions are at issue. Id. This holding abrogat ed a number o f Ninth Circuit cases based on two pr emises : (1) wher e uniquely governmenta l functions are at issue, the FTCA wai ves sover eign im munity if a state or municipal entity would b e held liable under the law whe re the activity occur red; and (2) certain conduct amounts to uniquely governmenta l functions because no private -sector analogue e xists. Id. at 44- 45 (citing Hine s v. Uni ted States, 60 F.3d 1442 (9th Cir. 199 5); Cimo v. INS, 16 F.3d 1039 (9th Cir. 1994 ); Camer on v. Janssen Bros. Nur series, Ltd., 7 F. 3d 821 (9th Cir. 199 3); Agui lar v. Un ited States, 920 F.2d 1475 (9th Cir. 199 0); and Dogge tt v. Un ited States, 875 F.2d 684 (9th Cir. 198 9)). The Co urt clarified that the FT CA's imposi tion of liability on the government in the same manner and to the same ext ent as on a private individ ual under \"like ci rcumstances\" does not restrict a court's inquiry to the same circumstan ces; rather, it is required to look fur ther afield. Olson, 546 U.S. a t 44, 4 6 (citing Indian Towi ng). A court must look for an appropriate analogy but the required private person analogue c annot be informed by whet her municipal or governmental liability for the alleged negli gent c ondu ct exists. Id. at 45-46 (\"Our cases have ed to this p erson' standard.\"). Suc is c onsistent with the \"like cir cumstan ces\" language of the Act . 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674 (2010). The Co urt interpreted the wo rds of the FT CA \"t o mean wha t they say, na mely, that the United States waives s overei gn im 'un der circumstances' wher ld make a ' private person' liable in tort.\" Id. at 44 (emphasi s in Olson) (quoting 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1346 (b)). A cou rt must look to t he state-law liability of private p ersons even when it assesses the government's FTCA li ability in the performance of activities whic h private persons do not perform - there is no e xception for what may be c onsidered \"uniquely governmenta l functions.\" Id. at 46 (citing Indian Towi ng and stating th e FT CA \"r equires a court to look to t he state-law liability of private e ntities, not to that of public entities, when assessing the [g]overn ment's liability unde r the FTCA\"). The Co urt went on to list a number o f instances wher e courts of appeals were able to find private person analogie s for a vari ety of gov ernmental tasks impli cated in FT CA cas es. Id. at 47 (citing Florida Au to Auction of Orlando , Inc. v. Uni ted States, 74 F.3d 498 (4th Cir. 1996) (inspection of automobile titles); Dork ing Gene tics v. Uni ted States, 76 F.3d 1261 (2d Cir. 1996) (inspection of cattle); Ayala v. United States, 49 F.3d 607 (10th Cir. 199 5) (mine i nspections); Myers v. Un ited States, 17 F.3d 890 (6th Cir. 1994) (same); Howel l v. Uni ted States, 932 F.2d 915 (11th Cir. 199 1) (inspection of airplanes)). Re ferring to the facts in Indian Towi ng, the Cou rt stated that \"[p]rivate individ o do not operate lighthous es, none theless may cre ate a relationship with third parties that is similar to the relationship between a lighthous e operator and a ship dependent on the lighth ouse's beacon.\" Olsen, 546 U.S. a t 47. Ba sed on the Cour t's holding in Olson, the FT CA li tigator must presume that a court will find a reasonable private person analogue f or the governmental activity at i ssue. It is incumbent upon the litigator to identify the most advant ageous analogue c onsidering the content of substantive st ate law. JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 7IV. Although a court will likely find that a reasonable private person analogue exists regardless of the nature of the government conduct at issue, no analogous private liability arguments remain readily available. A. Whether there is anal ogous p rivate liabi lity is a qu estion of su bject -matter jurisdiction. Following Olson, it became cle ar that any at tempt to characterize al leged gov ernmental acts or omissions as outside the purvie w of the FT CA's waiver of sover eign im munity sol ely becau se they relate to uniquely gov ernmental functions will not succeed. Similarly, it is clear that the FT CA wai ves th e United States' sover eign im munity and provides subject-matter jurisdiction wher e a private person, not a municipal or governmental entity, would be subject to liability. T his principle must b e read to cut both ways. Cons equently, wher e a private person in like cir cumstan ces woul d be shielded from liability unde r state law, t here can be no analogous private liability and the plaintiff's FTCA cl aims must b e dismisse d. Importantly, thi s means that any and a ll state law pr ovisi ons that substantively sha pe the bound s of a private p erson's liability in tort can be raised in connection wi th a \"no analogous pr ivate liability\" argument in an FTCA act ion. See 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1 346(b) (2010); Cleveland ex rel. Cle veland v. Uni ted States, 457 F.3d 397, 403 (5th Cir. 200 6) (discussing the principle that the FT CA re quires the Un ited States' liability to be measu red in accordance with the law of the state wher e the alleged ac t or omission occurred); Alexander v. Un ited States, 605 F.2d 828, 832 (5th Cir. 197 9) (\"[L]iability under the FT CA is governed by sta te law.\"). For example, the Uni ted States may alwa ys chal lenge the existence of a duty unde r state tort law. See, e.g., Barnes v. Un ited States, 448 F.3d 1065 (8th Cir. 200 6) (finding no analogous private liability bec ause private persons do not have a n independent duty und er Missouri state law to inspect poultry pro cessors). Addi tionally, if a state provisi on immunizes ce rtain types of private person conduct from tor t liability, the government is equally ent itled to these protections whe n it acts in like cir cumstan ces. Where a plaintiff fails to meet t he analogous t ort liability requirement of the FT CA, see 28 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2674 , 134 6(b) (2010 ), the plaintiff cannot carry his or her burden of establishing subject-matter jurisdiction. Ultimatel y, the F TCA's limited wa iver of sovere ign imm unity, and thus its limited gra nt of subject-matter jurisdiction, hinges on whet her a private p erson could be subject to state law liability unde r similar circums tances. See Olson, 546 U.S. a t 45 (holding that \"the wo rds 'like ci rcumstances' do not restrict a court's inquiry to the same circumstances, but require it to look fur ther afield\") (emphasis in Olson). As the Ninth Circuit recognized in LaBa rge v. Co unty of Mariposa, 798 F.2d 364 (9th Cir. 1986 ), \"the federal government could never be exactly like a rivate a ctor . . . [thus] a court's job in applying the standard is to find the most r easonable analogy.\" Id. at 367. This statement means that the government must be afforded protection even whe re the governmental conduct at issue presents \"similar,\" but not identical, circumstances to the type o f private p erson conduct shielded from li ability unde r state law. The FTCA li tigator must ask, \"Had a private person acted similarly to the actions complai ned of in the plaintiff's suit, wo uld state law al low for liability?\" If the answer is no, a motio n should be brought pu rsuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12 o r 56, de pending on the circumstances. Beca use a challenge to analogous private liability is inherently a ch allenge to jurisdiction, it is import ant to remember t hat the law starts with the presumption that a cause lies outside the limite d jurisdiction of the federal courts. See Kokk onen v. Guar dian Life Ins. Co . of Am., 511 U.S. 37 5, 37 7 (1994). Moreover, a court must consider jurisdiction as a threshold issue. See Steel Co. v . Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83 , 94-95 (19 98) (stating that the separation of power s doctrine requires a federal court to first determine whet her it has jurisdiction before reaching th e merit s of a case). As the party averr ing jurisdiction, the FT CA pl aintiff bears the burden of proof and must establish that the court 8 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011possesses subject-matter jurisdiction based upon analogous private liability. See Kokk onen, 511 U.S. a t 377 (\"It is to be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction . . . and the burden of establishing the c ontrary res ts upon the party ass erting jurisdiction.\"); see also M cNut t v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Cor p., 298 U.S. 17 8, 18 2-83, 1 89 (1936 ) (holding that the party asse rting jurisdiction may not be relieved of the burden of showing th at he is properly in co urt). Although t he FTCA's analogous private liability pro visio ns rely upon t he framewor k esta blished by sta te tort law for guid ance, see 28 U.S. in \"like circumstances\" woul d be subject to liability is a question of soverei gn im munity and is therefore ultimatel y a ques tion of federal law. See United States v. Ols on, 546 U.S. 43 , 44 (2005); see also Un ited States v. Mottaz, 476 U.S. 83 4, 84 1 (1986 ) (stating th e scope of the Uni ted States' waiver of sover eign immunity def ines v. Un ited States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 200 0) (affirming a Fe d. R. Ci v. P. 12 ( b)(1) dismissal based on the lack of analogous private liability). J udicial restraint requires federal courts to avoid liberal interpretation of any fe deral or state law whic h mig ht expand the government' s waiver of sovere ign imm unity wit hout congress ional approval . See U.S. De p't of Energy v. Oh io, 503 U.S. 60 7, 61 5 (1992 ) (holding that waivers o f soverei gn immunity and any con ditions on such wai vers must be \"construed strictly in favor of the soverei gn\") (quoting McMahon v. Uni ted States, 342 U.S. 25 , 27 (1951)); Linkous v. Uni ted States, 142 F.3d 271, 275 (5th Cir. 1998) (in assessing jurisdiction, a court \"must resolve all ambiguiti es in favor of the sovere ign\") . Thus, in assessing wheth er a private p erson under \"like ci rcumstances\" woul d be shielded from liability unde r state law, a c ourt must construe all relevant federal and state statutes in favor of the government. The analogous pr ivate liability requirement embedded in the FT CA ens ures that the Act does not create novel ca uses of action agains t the Un ited States, but rather serves onl y to ac cept government liability unde r \"like cir cumstan ces\" that are functionally equival ent to those wher e a private person woul d be liable. As described by the Sevent h Circuit, the FT CA's \"like ci rcumstances\" requirement is designed t o prevent state legisl atures from usi ng the United States' limited wa iver of sovere ign imm unity as an occasion to \"enrich their own ci tizens a t the expense of the deepest pocket.\" See Cart er v. Uni ted States, 982 F.2d 1141, 11 43 (7th Cir. 199 2). This protection is consistent with the FTCA's intent to limit the waiver of sover eign im munity to \"run-of-the- mine\" torts whe re clear, private analogues exist under state tort law. See United States v. Gaub ert, 499 U.S. 31 5, 32 5 (1991 ); Dale hite v. Uni ted States, 346 U.S. 15 , 28 (1953). Equa lly important is the notion that the \"law of the place wher e the act or occurred,\" referenced in U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1), Un ited States, 653 F.2d 196, 201 (5th Cir. 198 1). See also Fed. Depos it Ins. Co rp.v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 47 1, 47 9 (1994 ) (\"[W]e have co nsistently hel d that \u00a7 13 46(b)'s reference to the 'law of the place' means [the] law of the State - the source of substantive liability under the FT CA.\") . Henc e, the FTCA m easures the government' s liability by ref erencing th e law of the state wher e the act or omissi on at issue occurred. See Brown, 653 F.2d at 201 (\"[T]he liability of the United States unde r the [FTCA] a rises only when t he law of the state woul d impose it [on a private person].\"). This notion includes a state's choice of law rules. See Smith v. United States, 507 U.S. 19 7, 20 2 (1993 ); Richards v. Uni ted States, 369 U.S. 1, 11 (1962 ). It fol lows that the FTCA si mply ca nnot be read to create or enlarge subs tantive caus es of action that do n ot already exi st unde r state law. See Richards, 369 U.S. a t 7, 13-14; see also Winch ell v. U.S. De p't of Agriculture, 961 F.2d 1442 , 144 3 (9th Cir. 199 2) (under the FT CA, a p laintiff must s how t hat the wrongs al legedly comm itted \"wo uld be actionable in tort if comm itted by a pr ivate party unde r analogous c ircumstan ces, unde r the law of the state wher e the act or omissi on occurred\") (quoting Love v. Un ited States, 915 F.2d 1242 , 124 5 (9th Cir. 199 0)); Gold star (Pan ama) v. Un ited States, 967 F.2d 965, 969 -70 (4th Cir. 199 2). JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 9Desp ite plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary, th e FTCA's limited wa iver of sovere ign imm unity \"cannot apply wher e the claimed negli gence a rises from the failure of the Uni ted States to carry out a statutory dut y in t he condu ct of its own affairs.\" See Horn beck Offshore Transp. v. Uni ted States, 569 F.3d 506, 509 (D.C. Cir. 200 9). No an alogous pr ivate liability exi sts unless a private person in like circumstances woul d have a co rresponding duty unde r the appropriate state tort law. Internal policies, procedures, or statutes governing fede ral action, whi le potentially relevant to discretionary funct ion analysis, cannot serve to create a substantive ca use of action under the FTCA unl ess the condu ct at issue uous under applicable state law.\" Dalr ympl e v. Uni ted States, 460 F.3d 1318, 13 27 (11th Cir. 200 6); see also Johns on v. Sawy er, 47 F.3d 716, 727-29 (5th Cir. 199 5) (explaining that \"the viola tion of a federal statute or regulat ion does not give ri se to FTCA li ability unl ess the relationship between the [government actor] and the [plaintiff] is such that the former, i f a private person or entity, woul d owe a duty to the latter in a nonfederal context.\") (emphasis in Dalr ympl e). A federal statute or regulat ion that speaks onl y to t he government' s condu ct simply ca nnot be read to impose state tort law duties upon private p ersons. See Tindall v. Uni ted States, 901 F.2d 53, 56 (5th Cir. 199 0) (\"[A] federal regulat ion cannot establish a duty owed t o the plaintiff under state law.\"). To hold otherwise wou ld effectively \"di scriminat t the Un ited States.\" Johnson, 47 F.3d at 729. An FT CA li tigator must consider the state tort law, as sess whe ther a private person in like cir cumstan ces woul d have a dut y, and consider the prospects of an appropriate motio n to dismiss. Post Olson, it also became clear that state law pr ovisi ons that apply exc lusively to state or municipal employees will not prove hel pful in measur ing th e scope of FTCA li ability. See United States v. Ol son, 546 U.S. 43 , 45-46 (20 05); see, e.g., Hyat t v. Uni ted States, 968 F. Su pp. 9 6, 10 8 (E.D.N.Y. 1997 ). Such provisi ons have no bearing on Congre ss's required analogy to \"private person\" liability. See, e.g., United States v. Muniz, 374 U.S. 15 0, 16 4 (1963 ). For example, a state statute is irrelevant t o the required private person inquiry unde r the FTCA if the statute only dea ls with gov ernmental agenci es that perform the activities at issue in a case. In addition, whet her or how a state legisl ature has addressed the conduct of the Un ited States is irrelevant. Aside from obvious federalism concerns, such laws woul d have no bearing on th e required inquiry int o the analogous l iability of a p rivate p erson under similar circumstances. See 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 674 (2010). B. Aside f rom a state law no du ty argum ent, any and all def enses and statutory prote ctions availabl e to private persons un der stat e law are available to the United States and can successfull y be raised . Cour ts have c onsistently held that the government i s entitled to raise any and all defenses that woul d potentially be a vaila ble to a private c itizen o r private e ntity unde r state law. Thus, for the FTCA litigator , having an in -depth knowled ge of t he appropriate state law is invalua ble. Numerous examples of successful analogous private liability arguments based on s tate provisi ons are found throughout t he case law. Ult imatel y, \"a st ate may not protect private citizens f rom li ability wit hout also protecting th e federal government.\" See McClain v. Un ited States, 445 F. Su pp. 7 70 (D. Or. 1978 ). Inv ariably, t his statement also means that state law de fenses, exceptions to liability, imm unity pro visio ns, and limitations on recovery coe xtensively limit t he government' s FTCA li ability as they would l imit a private person's liability unde r simila r circumstan ces. See Owen v . Uni ted States, 935 F.2d 734, 737 (5th Cir. 199 1); Bank s v. Uni ted States, 623 F. Su pp. 2 d 751, 75 2 (S.D. M iss. 2009) (\"Where the FTCA app lies, the United States can assert the same def enses avail able to private citizens . . . .\"). Thus, if a state law provisio n is applicable to a private p erson under some se t of circumstan ces, the provisi on must a lways be considered equally appli cable to the Uni ted States when it is in like cir cumstan ces. See Palmer v. Flaggman , 93 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir. 199 6); Ewel l v. Uni ted States, 776 F.2d 246, 249 (10th Cir. 198 5) 10 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011(\"[I]mmunities created by stat e law whi ch are avail able to private persons will imm unize the federal government . . . .\"). In defending an FT CA act ion, the litigato r is limite d only by his or her willingness to engage th e provisio ns of state law. Rec ently, th e Uni ted States successfully raised the analogous pr ivate liability requirement to secure the dismissal of thousands of claims seeking pot entially bill ions of dollars in damag es. See WL 3168 116 (E.D. La. Au g. 9, 2010 WL 255 (E.D. La. June WL 201 0487 (E.D. La. May 18, 201 0). These three, separate rulings f ocused on the state law of three separate states - Alabama, Mississippi, and Lou isiana, respectively - whe re FEM A emergency hous ing uni ts were provided after Hurricanes Katrina and Ri ta in 2005 . The court ruled that no a nalogous, p rivate l iability exis ted because a private person under similar circumstances woul d have been shielded from liability. T he reason for this protection is based on vari ous state emergency prep aredness statutes that encourage th e provisi on of emergency assi stance by immunizing pri vate p ersons who volunt arily provide shelter in response to an emergency. State workers' compens ation statutes that address the statutory em ployer doc trine are also fertile sources of potential analogous pr ivate liability arguments. See, e.g., Pendley v. Uni ted States, 856 F.2d 699 (4th Cir. 1988) (applying Vi rgini a's wor kers' compens ation exclusivity provisi on in the context of an FTCA act ion); Thomas v. Ca lavar Co rp., 679 F.2d 416, 418 -19 (5th Cir. 198 2) (applying stat e worker s' compens ation imm unity in the context of an FTCA act ion). No analogous private liability exi sts if a private p erson or entity in l ike ci rcumstances woul d be protected from tor t liability by the exclusive remedy pro visio n of the applicable wor kers' compens ation statute. See Makarova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000) (affirming di smissa l of an FT CA act ion wher e, under state law, pl aintiff's exclusive remedy was under the wor kers' compens ation statute); see F.2d 364, 366 , 369 (9th Cir. 198 6) (stating the United States was \"immune from suit\" and the court \"lacked j urisdiction\" over third party clai ms whe re a private p arty in like cir cumstan ces woul d not be liable in contribution under the exclusive liability pro visio n of the state workers' compens ation statute). Under some st ate wor kers' compens ation acts, employees ' common law cl aims agains t \"statutory employers\" may be ba rred. See Hose v. Un ited States, 604 F. Su pp. 2 d 147 (D.D.C. 20 09) (dismissing FTCA cl aims brought b y an in dependent contractor who a lleged he was exposed to anthrax spores while working in a state department f acility). I n certain circumstances, the Uni ted States may be a ble to invoke statutory em ployer pr otection from suit as part of an analogous private liability argument. See Pend ley v. United States, 856 F.2d 699, 702 (4th Cir. 198 8) (holding the Air Force was the statutory em ployer of a private wo rker kil led in a rocket fuel explosion and was therefore entitled to protection from tort liability unde r the state's workers' compens ation act); Nelson v. U.S . Pos tal Serv., 189 F. Su pp. 2 d 450, 45 4-59 (W.D. V a. 2002) (finding th at the private truck dri ver pl aintiff was the statutory employee of the Postal Service) . A st atutory em ployer is someone who subcontracts to have some or a ll of the wor k that is part of his or her trade, bus iness, or occupation performed by other s. Hose , 604 F. Su pp. 2 d. at 150 (citations omitted) (\"This 'statutory acts] is designed t o ensure that owne rs do n ot escape liability for workers' compens ation benefits by havin g thei r work per formed by other s.\"). Where the Un ited States, if a private person, woul d be considered the plaintiff's \"statutory em ployer,\" s tate law may dic tate that no a nalogous pr ivate liability exi sts. See, e.g., Hyman v. Uni ted States, 796 F. Su pp. 9 05, 9 06 (E.D. V a. 1992). A si milar argument can be made based on state provisi ons that allow a private person or private entity to r aise the borrowe d servant defense. See JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 11Starnes v. Uni ted States, 139 F.3d 540, 542 (5th Cir. 199 8) (applying the s tate law bor rowe d servant defense in the context of an FTCA act ion). Anot her popular source for potential analogous pr ivate liability arguments is state recreational land use statutes that imm unize pri vate p ersons or entities from li ability. See, e.g., Palmer v. Uni ted States, 945 F.2d 1134 (9th Cir. 199 1) (holding that Hawai i's recreational land use statute imm unized th e United States from li ability, just as it woul d protect a private p erson due to the FT CA's analogous private liability requirement); Woods v. Un ited States, 909 F. Su pp. 4 37, 4 42 (W.D. La. 1 995) (dismissing an FTCA act ion based on private landown er imm unity afforded by Loui siana's recreational use statute); Hanno n v. United States, 801 F.Sup p. 32 3 (E.D. Cal . 199 2) (holding that the Uni ted States was entitled to the protection of California's recreational land use statute based on the FTCA's analogous private liability pro visio n, even tho ugh the statute only appli ed to private , not governmental, landown ers). As stated in Hanno n, if \"[the land use statute] applies to private persons, so it must also apply to t he Un ited States in [an FTCA] c ase.\"). Id.at 326. Some sta te law provisi ons even pr ovide f or damag es caps (particularly in the medical malpractice context) that can be successfully raised as part of an analogous pr ivate liability argument. See, e.g., Starns v. Uni ted States, 923 F.2d 34, 37 (4th Cir. 199 1). Other state provisi ons may only al low for liability upon a showi ng of gros s negligence or willful and want on misco nduc t, depending upon t he type of activity at i ssue. See, e.g., Bunt ing v. Un ited States, 884 F.2d 1143 (9th Cir. 198 9) (holding that for purposes of the FTCA act ion, the Coa st Guar d had to be afforded the same prot ections that a private person woul d be afforded under similar circumstances wher e there is no preexisting duty, namely, th e protections set forth in Alaska' s Goo d Samaritan statute, whi ch limite d liability to onl y thos e circumstances wher e a plaintiff can establish gros s negligence ); Ortiz v. U.S . Bor der Patrol, 39 F. Sup p. 2d 1321, 1322-23 (D.N.M. 1999) (applying a st ate statute ng pri vate p erson liability to only thos e circumstances wher e a plaintiff can establish gros s negligence ); Priah v. Uni ted States, 590 F. Su pp. 2 d 920, 930 (N.D. Ohio 2008) (holding that the discretionary funct ion exception barred the negli gence claim and finding government a ctor's condu ct not want on or reckle ss). Although st ate statutes of limitation are not applicable in FT CA cas es, see, e.g., Benge v. Uni ted States, 17 F.3d 1286 , 128 8 (10th Cir. 1994), a number of states have st atutes of repose that are considered substantive, rat her than procedural, in nature and are thus sufficiently ripe to be raised as part of a private analogous liability argument. See Resolution Tr ust Corp . v. Olson, 768 F. Su pp. 2 83, 2 85 (D. Ariz. 1991) ; Goad v . Cel otex Cor p., 831 F.2 d 508 (4th Cir. 198 7). See, e.g., Simmons v. Uni ted States, 421 F.3d 1199 , 119 9-1200 (11th Cir. 200 curiam) (di smissi ng an FT CA cl aim for medic al malpractice based on Ge orgia 's statute of repose); Vega v. Un ited States, 512 F. Su pp. 2 d 853 (W.D. Tex. 2007 ) (applying T exas' state statute of repose and dismissing negligent design cl aims in the context of an FTCA act ion relating to a drainage ca nal); Brown v. Un ited States, 514 F. Su pp. 2 d 146, 15 5-58 (D. Mass. 2007) (dismissi ng an FT CA act ion based upon the Massachusetts statute of repose); Manion v. United States, No. CV -06-739-HU , 200 6 WL 299 0381 (D. Or. t. 18, 20 06) (applying Oregon's ultimate s tatute of repose in the context of an FTCA act ion). A statute of repose serves as an absolute bar to all suits that are brought b eyond a fixed period of time after the defendant acted, regardl ess of whet her this period ends before the plaintiff suffered the alleged i njury. Some st atutes are specific to latent disease claims, whil e others deal specifically wit h medica l malpr actice actions. See, e.g., Ande rson v. United States, CCB- 08-3, 20 10 W L 134 6409 , at *4 (D. M d. M ar. 30, 2010) (applying Mar yland' s 5-y ear statute of response for the filing of medical malpractice claims in the context of an FTCA act ion). These are but a few ex amples of the types of state law pr otections and immunity pro visio ns avail able to private persons and, thus, avail able to the Un ited States in FT CA act ions. Even wh ere the governmental activity at i ssue does not squarely meet the terms of a state law provisi on that shields a 12 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011private p erson from liability, th e government may still have a meri torious argum ent based on the argument that no a nalogous pr ivate liability exi sts. C. The F TCA's \"like circ umstances\" language does not m ean the \"sam e circumstances,\" for the governm ent is entitled to r aise state defenses an d protect ions w ith w hich it h as only functionally, rather than literally, com plied. The FTCA's \"like ci rcumstances\" test must be read to cut both ways be cause the United States is seldom iden tically situated to private parties. As d iscussed above, if a reasonable analogue e xists, then the United States may be l iable under the FT CA for activities that could be considered uniquely governmental in nature; but, in turn, the Uni ted States must be afforded the benefit of state immunity statutes and non-liability pro visio ns wi th whic h the government h as only funct ionally, ra ther than literally, com plied. See Hill v.

Che mical Co. v . Uni ted States, 810 F.2d 34, 37 (2d Ci r. 1987) (focusing on whet her private l would e 364, 367 (9th Cir. 198 6) (\"Beca use the federal government c ould never be exactly like a pr ivate actor, a court's job in applyin g the s tandard is to find the most reasonable analogy.\"). To determine wh ether a state imm unity or non-liab ility provisi on is implicated in the context of an FTCA act ion, the focus must r emain on \"like ci rcumstances\" because the \"FTCA ass ures the federal government of that treatment accorded private parties.\" Starns v. Un ited States, 923 F.2d 34, 37 (4th Cir. 1991 ). This understanding al so holds true when the government c annot meet certain prerequisites to raising a s tate provisi on due to unique, governmenta l attributes that stem from the inherent difference between the government a nd a private person. See Hill, 393 F.3d at 1118 (\"[T]o hold that the Uni ted States is not entitled to the protection of [the state law provisi on] woul d place it in a differently situated position than private p arties . . . thereby unde rminin g the c to the Un ited States' waiver of The FTCA's \"like ci rcumstances\" language is necessarily flexible. It only re quires that the government a ctivity at i ssue be the functional equivalent of the kind of private c ondu ct shielded from state tort liability, ens uring that the government i s placed on equal footing with private persons (as required by the FTCA) de spite their inherent differences. While the analogous private l iability inqui ry cons iders the framewor k of st ate law for guidan ce, it is not answered through a rote application of state law to the facts of a particular case. Id. Thus, even whe re the government f ails to meet the exact terms of a state statutory pro visio n limiting or precluding lia bility, the Un ited States is considered in \"like ci rcumstances\" to a private p arty that has actually met the requirements \"whe re the [government] has satisfied the objectives of a statutory scheme. See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co . v. United States, 3 F. 3d 1392, 1396-97, 1 398 (10th Cir. 199 3) (emphasis added). In Nationwi de, the Tenth Circuit examined a case involving an a utomobile and held that the government' s functional, though no t literal, compliance with the statutory req uirements of Colo rado state law placed the Un ited States in \"like ci rcumstances\" to those private persons who are literally prot ected by a Colo rado automobile insurance statute. Id. at 1396-97. Addi tional examples applying thi s principle exist in a number o f jurisdictions. In Starns v. United States, 923 F.2d 34 (4th Cir. 199 1), the Fourth Circuit considered wh ether the government s hould be afforded the benefit of a Virginia state law ca p on medical malpractice liability. Th e Fourth Circuit held that under the FT CA's \"like ci rcumstances\" provisi on, the statutory ca p on medical malpractice liability appl ied to the federally-operated hospital at issue. The court reasoned that the government wa s in JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 13like cir cumstan ces to a private p rovid er that woul d be entitled to benefit from the cap, even t hough i t was not licensed by the state in accordance with the statutory ca p's requirements. Id. at 37. Simila rly, the Tenth Circuit applied a state law statutory ca p in the context of an FTCA act ion even t hough t he Un ited States had not specifically complie d with a number of requirements set forth in the statute. Hace esa v. United States, 309 F.3d 722, 725 -27 (10th Cir. 2002). In Estate of Boon e v. Uni ted States, 591 F. Su pp. 2d 800, 8 02 (D. M d. 20 08), the district court applied a Marylan d statutory imm unity pro visio n to a claim agains t the Un ited States in an FTCA act ion despite the fact that the provisi on wa s intended for private fire compani es. The district court found that the government wa s in like ci rcumstances to a non-profit, private, s elf-insured, fire company. Th e court reasoned that the Uni ted States was thus afforded the same state law immunity pro tections that woul d apply to a private f ire company under Marylan d law, e ven though the government had not specifically complie d with all of the requirements that a private fire company m ust meet under state law to gain immunity. Id. at 802-04 (explaining that \"the specific requirements of the Maryland s tatute do not dictate the government' s liability in t his action . . . [r]ather, the 'FTCA ass ures the federal government o f that treatment accorded private parties.' \") (quoting Starns v. Uni ted States, 923 F.2d 34, 37 (4th Cir. 199 1)). In yet a nother case, a district court analogized th e Uni ted States to a private person who wa s not required to carry insu rance pursuant to New J ersey st ate law by con cluding that the Uni ted States had functionally, th ough not literally, com plied wi th the state insurance requirements. Cont 'l Ins. v. Uni ted States, 335 F. Su pp. 2 d 532, 54 3 (D.N.J . 200 4). Finally, in U.S. Fi delity & Guar anty Co. v. Un ited States, 728 F. Sup p. 65 1, 65 4 (D. Uta h 1989), the district court found that the Un ited States shared simila r circumstances with a secured owne r or operator of a vehi cle under state law de spite the fact that the government had not strictly complie d with some of the prerequisites set forth by st ate law. V. In conclusion, an FTCA litigator is only limited by his or her understanding of the substantive state law in raising arguments under the FTCA's analogous private liability requirement. The number and type o f state statutes that can be raised as part of a no analogous pr ivate liability argument in an FTCA act ion are countless. Looking th rough the lens of private a nalogous l iability, the United States may not be exposed to grea ter liability than a private person under similar circumstances. Any sta te law provisi on that shields (in whol e or in part) private persons from tor t liability can be raised by the United States under similar factual circumstances. This option gives li tigants flexibility to ar gue that the challenged gov ernmental activity is the functional equivale nt of an activity that is protected or addressed by st ate law. I n the end, it is the plaintiff's burden to show how the government conduct at issue in the case was functionally dif ferent from the kind of private p erson conduct shielded from tor t liability unde r state law. From the earliest FTCA cas es, plaintiffs have str essed that a reasonable analogue c an always be found for the governmental activity at i ssue, even in cases wher e the activity am ounts to a uniquely governmental function. As t he Supreme Court adopted this trend, it opened an oppo rtunity for government counsel defending FT CA cas es to seek reas onable private person analogues that woul d likewise be shielded from liability. In adjudicating FT CA cas es, courts are called upon to remove the governmental cloak, st rip awa y the i nherent differences between the government a nd a private person, find the most reasonable private person analogy, and a ssess whet her a private p erson could be subject to state law liability under \"simila r circumstan ces.\" Onl y thro ugh a co mplete comm and of the underlying state tort law can an FTCA li tigator identify all potential analogous pr ivate liability arguments and successfully pres erve the FTCA's explicit restrictions on its waiver of sovere ign imm unity.\u0098 14 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011ABOUT THE AUTHO R \u0091Adam M.

Fishback Assistant Dir ector Environmental Torts Section Torts Branch, Ci vil Division I. Introduction The wa iver of sovere ign imm unity fou nd in the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 2 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-80, a ppears, at first blush, to be quite sweeping. Gener ally, it provides that the \"United States shall be liable [in tort] in the same m anner and to the same ext ent as a private i ndividual under like circumstances.\" Id. \u00a7 2674. But, as the late Har vard La w Pro fessor Phillip Areeda always tol d his students, it is import ant to \"read on.\" The last section of the FTCA pro vides that the provisi ons of the FTCA \"sh all not apply alia] (a) Any clai m . . . based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary funct ion or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whet her or not the discretion involved be a bused. 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 680 (2010). This section contains a number of exceptions to the FTCA's waiver of sovere ign imm unity, but , as the Fourth Circuit noted in McMellon v. Uni ted States, 387 F.3d 329, 335 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc), the \"most import ant of these exceptions . . . is the discretionary funct ion exception.\" The statutory la nguage above i s also part of the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5148 , of emergenci es; consequently, the a nalysis p rovid ed in this article is equally applicable to suits brought p ursuant to the Stafford Act. See, e.g., Freeman v. Uni ted States, 556 F.3d 326, 336 (5th Cir. 200 9). Litigant s are often unawar e of the extent to whic h the FTCA wai ver of sover eign im munity is limited. In fact, the scope of the wai ver is quite narrow, du e largely to t he discretionary funct ion exception. Prior to 1946, there was no waiver at all for non-m aritime tor ts because, prior to the expansion of the federal government during th e New Deal and the enormous growth of the public sector during World War II, Congre ss did not perceive a ne ed for such a waiver. Bef ore then, all complaints agains t the government for tortuous ly inj uring its citizens we re resolved (i f at all) through pri vate l egisl ation. As t he government grew, t he \"oppo rtunities\" for negligent actions increased and Co ngress deemed the private legisla tion approach to be inadequate. On t he other hand, Congre ss did not want individ ual district court judges t o second-guess p olicy judgm ents of the elected branches of government. See United States v. 16 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011Gaube rt, 499 U.S. 31 5, 32 3 (1991 ) (the purpose of the discretionary funct ion exception is to \"prevent judicial tive and a in social, economic, a nd political policy\") (q uoting United States v. S.A. Empr esa de Viacao Aerea Rio Gran dense (Varig U.S. 797, (1984)). Indeed, such second-guessi ng would have c reated constitutional problems regardi ng the separation of powe rs doctrine. See Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. a t 809-10. W hen the FTCA was enacted in 1946, its discretionary funct ion exception was included as part of the limite d waiver of sover eign im munity to address these concerns. For a more d etailed discussion of this history, see David S. Fishback & Gail Killefer, The Discretionar y Function Exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act: From Da lehite to Var ig to Berkovitz, 25 IDAHO L. REV. 291 (1989). The funda mental purpose of the discretionary funct ion exception is to \"mark[] t he bound ary between Congres s' willingness to impose tort liability upon t he Un ited States and its desire to protect certain governmental activities from exposure to suit by privat e individual s.\" Berkovitz v. Uni ted States, 486 U.S. 53 1, 53 6 (1988 ) (quoting Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. a t 808). In order to explain the scope of the discretionary funct ion exception to potential oppos ing counsel or to judges wh o may not be familiar with the exception, it is useful to note at the outset that the issue posed by the e xception is not whet her a claimant o ught t o receive co mpensation from the federal government. Rat her, the question is whet her the claimant i s seeking re dress in the appropriate forum: the courts or, as it was for all non-maritime cas es before 1946, Con gress . (The Suits in Admira lty Act (SAA) , U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30901-3091 8 (2009 ), enacted in 1920, p rovid es a wai ver of federal sover eign immunity for admira lty case s. While the SAA doe s not, by its own t erms, include a discretionary funct ion exception, the courts have un iformly held that a discretionary funct ion exception must be implie d under the separation of powe rs doctrine. See McMellon, 387 F.3d at 335-38 (collecting ca ses)). Indeed, the first discretionary funct ion exception case to come bef ore the Supreme Cou rt, Dale hite v. Uni ted States, 346 U.S. 15 (1953), involved j ust the sort of circumstance that Congres s deemed to remain wi thin its purview fo r compensation. In that case, fertilizer bound for post-World War II Europe under the Marshall Plan exploded in the harbor of Texas City, T exas, kil ling m ore than 500 people, woun ding many oth ers, and causing imm ense property dam age. See In re Texas Ci ty Disaster Litig., 197 F.2d 771, 772 (5th Cir. 195 2) (en banc). In Dale hite, the Supreme Cou rt affirmed th e discretionary funct ion exception dismissa ls, and Con legisl ation providi ng compensa tion those hurt. See In re \"Age nt Oran ge\" Prod uct Liability Litigation, 304 F.Sup p.2d 404 (E.D.N. Y. 200 4) (citing T exas City Dis aster Relief Act, Pub. L . No. 8 4-378, 69 S tat. 707 (1955 )), aff'd 517 F.3d 76 (2d Ci r. 2008), cert. 129 S.Ct . 152 3 (2009 ). Co ngress took simila r steps followin g the discretionary funct ion exception dismissa ls of suits brought b y the \" downwi nders\" - people who alleged tha t their cancers were caused by ra diation from the government's above-ground nuclear testing in the 1950s and 1960s . See Allen v. Uni ted States, 816 F.2d 1417 (10th Cir. 1987). See also Radi Compensa tion Ac t, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2210 (note) (2009). In its most recent discussion of the exception, United States v. Gau bert, 499 U.S. 31 5 (1991 ), the Supr eme Court set forth fairly clea r standards for when the exception applies. An allegedly negligent act or omission falls within the discretionary funct ion exception (and thus bars jurisdiction over t he case) if: (1) it did not viol ate a pertinent self-imposed statute, regulat ion, or policy that prescribed a specific course of action (the function was \"discretionary\"); and (2) it was \"susceptible to policy anal ysis\" ving \"soc political\" iderations. Id. at 322-23, 3 25. T hese two pa rts of the analysis are popularly known as Prong One an d Prong T wo. T hus, the title of this article, The Fede ral Tort Claims Act is a Very Lim ited Waiver of Sovereign Immun ity \u2014 So L ong as Agencies Follow Their Own Rul es and Do Not Simply Ignore Problems, convey s the essence of what government counsel needs to know. T o paraphrase the grea t sage Hil lel, \"All the rest is comm entary.\" However, u nderstanding the JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 17comm entary is ne cessary for a n effective de fense in FTCA cas es. (The two pr ong tes t was first set forth in Berkovitz, supra. Berkovitz left some lo ose ends, see Fishback & Ki llefer, at 321-27, wh ich wer e tied up in Gaube rt, 499 U.S. a t 326, 3 33 (regardi ng the relevance o f Indian Towi ng Co ., Inc. v. Uni ted States, 350 U.S. 61 (1955) and \"technical decisions,\" respectively). T hus, it is usually bes t to first cite Gaube rt in explaining the scope of the discretionary funct ion exception.) II. Two preliminary matters A. Negligence is irrele vant to the analysis It is useful to clarify at t he outset that, in deciding the discretionary funct ion exception question, issues of negli gence a re ion inquiry.\" Kenn Irrigation Dist. v. Uni ted States, 880 F.2d 1018, 10 29 (9th Cir. 198 9). Accord, e.g., Hix v. U.S . Army Corp s of Engi neers, 155 Fed. Appx . 121 , 128 (5th Cir. 200 5); Lope z v. Uni ted States, 376 F.3d 1055, 10 56 (10th Cir. 200 4). Cons equently, is sues of analogous private liability (di scussed in Ada m M. Dinnell's article in this edition of the U.S. At torneys' Bulletin) are not germ ane to the threshold analysis of whet her a case is actually wit hin the limite d wai ver of sover eign im munity. B. Interact ion w ith the contrac tor e xception Anot her matter that should be clarified at the outset is that the discretionary funct ion exception threshold issue is import ant in cases involving all egati ons that a government c ontractor was negli gent. In such cases, the contractor exception to liability unde r the FTCA - see 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 2 671 (the negligenc e of a federal agency pote ntially the subject of an FTCA act ion \"does not include [the negligenc e of] any contractor with the Un ited States\") - may not itself bar a suit alleging g overnmenta l negligenc e in selecting or supervisin g a cont ractor. Indeed, particularly wher e states have non- delegable duty regim es (i.e., whe re private persons or entities may not, und er state tort law, avoid responsibility for s upervising their contractors), analogous pr ivate liability may exi st. However , the discretionary funct ion exception bars such suits under the FT CA bec ause decisions about selecting con tractors and the degree t o whi ch the government will overse e the wo rk of i ts contractors are typical ly not constrained by spe cific and mandatory se lf-imposed obligations, and are thus susceptible to policy consi derations. See In re Cons ol. U.S. At mosp heric Testing Li tig., 820 F.2 d 982, 99 6-97 (9th Cir. 198 7) (holding that claims agains t federal contractors for radiation injuries resulting fro m nuclear weap ons testing ar e barred by the FT CA's discretionary funct ion exception), distinguish ing Gard ner v. Uni ted States, 780 F.2d 835 (9th Cir. 198 6) (whe re the Uni ted States was liable under a non-delegable duty theor y). Accord Iron Pa rtners v. Mar. Admi n., No. C0 8-5217 RBL, 20 09 W L 577 539 (W.D. W ash. Mar. 5, 2 009) (contracting wit h a private company for the operation of a shipyard) ; Heinrich v. Swe et, 308 F.3d 48, 59 (1st Cir. 200 2) (contracting invol ved m edical radiation experimentation); Andr ews v. Uni ted States, 121 F.3d 1430, 14 40-41 (11th Cir. 199 7) (contracting wit h a private c ompany for wa ste disposal from military bases ); Williams v . United States, 50 F.3d 299, 303-05 (4th Cir. 199 5) (contractor responsibility for maint enance at a federal building); Kirchman n v. United States, 8 F. 3d 1273, 1275-78 (8th Cir. 199 3) (contracting wit h a private company regard ing a miss ile base); Shuma n v. United States, 765 F.2d 283, 290 -94 (1st Cir. 198 5) (claims of n egligent exposure to asbestos that involved con tracting wit h a private s hipyard) . Only wher e the government f ails to carry out mandat ory and specific over sight re sponsibilities that it imposes upon itself will the discretionary funct ion exception not bar a suit based on an alleged failure to supervise a contractor. See, e.g., McMichael v. Uni ted States, 856 F.2d 1026, 10 33 (8th Cir. 1988 ) (wher e acts of government inspectors of an Army contractor munitions plant were not discretionary as t he inspectors failed to follow a 5 1-part checklist for safety com pliance). 18 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011III. Prong One A. In general As a gener al propos ition, a determination as to whe ther a particular case should be dismissed due to the discretionary funct ion exception will likely be straightf orwa rd. If the act or omissi on did not invol ve a sp ecific and mandat ory se lf-imposed obligation, the first prong of t he analysis i s satisfied in favor of the Uni ted States. See, e.g., Garc ia v. U.S . Air Force, 533 F.3d 1170 , 117 8 (10th Cir. 2008). Moreover, e ven if there was a specific and mandatory obl igation, the first prong is satisfied if the Un ited States did not viol ate it. See, e.g., Abre u v. United States, 468 F.3d 20, 26-27 (1st Cir. 200 6); Elder v. United States, 312 F.3d 1172, 11 77 (10th Cir. 2002) (plaintiffs must, to prevail on the first prong, \"sh ow that [federal] employees viol ated a federal statute, regulat ion, or policy that is both 'specific and mandatory.' \" ). Even if there was a viol ation of a specific and mandatory obl igation, the first prong does not yield a determination agains t the Un ited States if the viol ation made no d ifference with respect to the alleged negli gence. See, e.g., Andr ews v. Uni ted States, 121 F.3d 1430, 14 39, 1 441 (11th Cir. 199 7) (noting that the discretionary funct ion exception bars the case wher e the evidenc e \"showed t hat there was no causal link betwe en the Na vy's failure to segregate [waste mater ials, in viola n.5 ) and explaining that \"to cancel discretionary funct ion imm unity, a di rective m ust not only be spe cific and mandatory, i t must also be relevant to the claims unde rlying the s uit\" (id. at 1441, emphasis in origina l). In Andr ews, the viol ation that took plac e on a naval b ase did not matt er because all of the mater ial was then given to a contractor who t ook the material to a landfill in whi ch there was no requirement or expectation of segregati on. Accord Montijo-Reyes v. Uni ted States, 436 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 200 6) (discretionary funct ion exception application not vitiated wh ere the alleged viola tion of a cause [the] States, 286 F. Supp . 2d 1, 18 (D. D.C. 200 3), aff'd 393 F.3d 155 (D.C. Cir. 200 4) (to defeat the discretionary funct ion exception, \"a directive m ust not only be spe cific and mandat ory, i t must also be relevant to the claims unde rlying the s uit.\" (emphasi s in the original ). For this reason, as noted earlier, the appropriate formulat ion of the standard for the first prong is whet her the Uni ted States viola ted a pertinent self-impo sed, specific, and mandat ory obl igation. In addition, there is recent authority for t he proposition that a viol ation of a federal statute requiring ce rtain actions by th e Uni ted States may not be ger mane to the Prong One a nalysis i f the statute itself does not provide f or a private cause of action. See Abreu, 468 F.3d at 30-32. But see In re Katrina Ca nal Breaches Cons olidated Litig., 647 F. Su pp. 6 44, 7 17-18 (E.D. La . 200 9), Notice of Appe al filed Feb. 25 , 201 0. B. State law sp ecific and mandatory obligations generally not relevant It is important to remember t hat state law regim es imposi ng spec ific and mandatory obl igations on private p arties are not relevant un less the United States has made a specific decision to impose those rules upon itself. See, e.g., Sydnes v. Un ited States, 523 F.3d 1179, 11 84 (10th Cir. 2008); Kirchman n, 8 F.3d at 1275-76. E fforts by pl aintiffs to use such state law do ctrines confuse the analogous pr ivate liability ana lysis with the discretionary funct ion analysis. C. Is the rule m andatory? Sometimes t here may be a dispute over wh ether a pertinent, self-imposed rule is mandatory. For example, in Arag on v. Uni ted States, 146 F.3d 819 (10th Cir. 199 8), the plaintiff was unsuccessful in JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 19contending that language in a n Air Force manual setting fo rth objectives t o be reached constituted a mandatory, se lf-imposed obligation because \"an agenc y manual, in contrast to a regulat ion, is not necessarily enti tled to the force and effect of law . . . . This is particularly true if the agency did n ot intend the manual to be mandatory, but rather intended it as a guidan ce or advis ory doc ument.\" Id. at 824. Further, wh en, as in Arag on, the manual at issue states that actions should be taken \"as practicable,\" they are n ot mandatory. Id. at 826. Thus, any writ ten policies that cover t he actions at issue in a given case should be examined closely to see if the government maint ains discretion, notwithstanding la nguage that might su ggest that taking cert ain actions is required. The thing to r emem ber is that a rule or policy takes a case out of the discretionary funct ion exception only if t here is absolutely no oth er option for the government t han to do a particular thing. As the Supr eme Court explained in Berkovitz, the discretionary funct ion exception will not apply when a federal statute, regulat ion, or policy specifically pre scribes a course of action for an employee to follow. I n this event , the employee has no rightf ul option but to adhere to the directive. 486 U.S. at 536. Finally, th e fact that a particular objective may be s tated does not mean that the discretionary function exception does not apply if t he objective is not reached. Rat her, the issue is whe ther there was , as Berkovitz pointed out in the above- quoted language, a specific and mandat ory \"c ourse of conduct\" that was viola ted. Berkovitz, 486 U.S. a t 539; Arag on, 146 F.3d at 823-24. Accord Montez ex rel. Estate of Hear lson v. Uni ted States, 359 F.3d 392, 395 , 399 (6th Cir. 200 4); Cestonar o v. United States, 211 F.3d 749, 755-56 (3d Ci r. 2000). Thus, it is import ant to look very clos ely to de termine wh ether an agency rule or policy is i n fact mandatory wit hin the ambit of the discretionary funct ion exception analysis. D. What about prof essional stand ards? As the Ni nth Circuit explained in Kenn ewick Irrigation Dist. v. Uni ted States, 880 F.2d 1018, 1026 -27 (9th Cir. 198 9), applying Berkovitz and anticipating the analysis in Gaube rt, \"a safety or engine ering st andard operates to remove dis cretion under the FT CA when it is embodie d in a specific and manda tory regulat ion or statute which creates clear duties incumbent upon the government actors\" (emphasis in the original ), but such standards do not remov e discretion when they are not so embodie d. The Kenn ewick court explained that \"[o]nce the government, having bala nced economic, s ocial and political policy consi derations, adopts safety stan dards in the form of s pecific and mandatory re gulat ions or policy, em ployees do not have a ny dis cretion to viola te these standards.\" Id. at 1026-27. Ho wever, those safety stan dards themselves must be sufficiently spe cific to deprive the government of the ability to satisfy Pron g One. E. Is the rule specific enough ? Sometimes t here may be a dispute as to whet her a pertinent, self-imposed , mandatory ru le is sufficiently spe cific for the discretionary funct ion exception not to apply. In this regard, i t is important to recognize t hat the courts consistently require a signif icant degre e of specificity to conclude that discretion has been remov ed. Moreover, t his specificity relates to wha t the government a ctor must do with respect to the specific course of action the actor must take - not the result that must be achieved. See, e.g., Freeman , 556 F.3d at 337-38 (explaining that \"provisi ons [containing] generalized, pr ecatory, or aspirational language tha t is too gene ral to prescribe a specific course of action for an agenc y or employee t o follow\" d o not remov e discretion within the discretionary funct ion exception); OSI, Inc. v. 20 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011United States, 285 F.3d 947, 952 (11th Cir. 200 2) (\"[A]n agenc y manual which provid es only obj ectives and principles for a government a gent t o follow doe s not create a mandatory di rective whi ch overcomes the discretionary funct ion exception.\"); Elder, 312 F.3d at 1177-78 (explaining that the Nat ional Park Service manual does not remov e discretion because even tho ugh it \"conveys the message th at safety must be a priority, and i t assists park management by foc using on a n umber of elements that should be encompassed by a sa fety pro gram . . . it does not dictate what actions park em ployees must t ake in response to particular problems.\"); Blackburn v. Un ited States, 100 F.3d 1426, 14 31 (9th Cir. 199 6), cited with appr oval in Elder, 312 F.3d 1172 (10th Cir. 2002) (involving the same analysis o f the same National Park Service manual); Snyder v. Un ited States, 504 F. Su pp. 2 d 136, 14 0-41 (S.D. M iss. 2007), aff'd 296 Fed. Appx. 399 (5th Cir. 200 8) (whe re a requirement t hat \"refuse, in any fo rm, shoul d not be disposed of where it may pollute surface or underground waters whi ch are event ually to be used as drinking wate r\" did not remov e discretion because the requirement was not sufficiently spe cific). IV. Prong Two A. In general By way of review, an allegedly negligent act or omission falls within the discretionary funct ion exception if: (1) the function was discretionary; and (2) it was \"susceptible to policy anal ysis\" involving \"social, economic, o r political\" policy cons iderations. United States v. Gau bert, 499 U.S. 31 5, 32 2-23, 325 (1991). The analysis o f Prong T wo issues is often less mechanical than Prong One. No matte r how obvio us a policy may see m, it is always a good i dea to lay out e ach policy, whet her through evidenc e of factors explicitly consi dered or through an e xplanation why th gence i mplicates policy they were actually consi dered. Although, a s shown be low, actual consideration need not be demonst rated, it is always usef ul to discuss the actual considerations, if only to give the court a comfort level. W hen direct evide nce of policy consi derations is not avail able - a common problem in situations wher e the alleged ne gligence occurred many y ears or even de cades before - it may be useful to secure witnesses qualified to discuss what those considerations woul d have been . At the outset, it is import ant to remember t hat when Congres s enacted the FTCA, it s \"thought was centered on grant ing re lief for the run-of-the- mine accidents,\" namely, the shed inj fro m discretionary government a ctivities. Dale hite, 346 U.S. at 28, 30. T he most frequently cited example i n the legisl ative hi story was \"negligence in the operation of vehi cles.\" Id. at 28. As the Supreme Court noted in Gaube rt, the negligent operation of an automobile gener ally woul d not be within the discretionary funct ion exception because decisions in driving \"can hardly be said to be ground ed\" in policy. Gaube rt, 499 U.S. a t 325. B. Ke y Gaubert hold ings In Gaube rt, the Cou rt explained that if the government ha d discretion under Prong One, t he discretionary funct ion exception applies if the government' s economic, political\" policy cons iderations. 499 U.S. a t 323-31. T he details of the Cour t's analysis a re worth repeating: 1. \"Bec ause the purpose of the exception is to prevent judicial second-guessi ng of legisla tive and a dministrative deci sions ed in social, economic, a nd political policy thro ugh the medium of an action in tort . . . the exception protects only governmental actions and decisions based on c onsiderations of public policy.\" Id. at 323 (quotations from Varig and Berkovitz omitt ed). JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 212. In addition to planning-level de cisions, whi ch are plainly wit hin the exception, \" the actions of Government agents involving the n ecessary element of choice and grou nded in the social, economic, or political goals of the statute and regulat ions are protected.\" Id. Thus, the operational/planning di stinction set forth by the Fifth Circuit in ruling agains t the United States in the underlying act ion (whereby the planning dec isions were deemed to be wi thin the exception, b ut operational decisions were not) was rejected by the Supr eme Court . See id. at 326 (noting that Dale hite contained \"no suggestion that decisions made a t an operational level co uld not also be based on p olicy,\" an d referring to the \"nonexistent dichotomy betwe en discretionary funct ions and operational activities\"). 3. The argum ent that \"challenged ac tions fall outside the discretionary funct ion exception because they invol ve the mere application of technical skills\" fails because that \"is just another way of sa ying that the considerations involving the d ay-to-day m anagement . . . are so precisely formulat ed that decisions at the operational level ne ver involve th e exercise of discretion within the meani ng of \u00a7 2680 (a), a notion that we ha ve alr eady rejected.\" Id. at 331. The Co urt then we nt on to address the question of when \"technical\" decisions mig ht be outside the scope of the exception, e xplaining that while it \"may be that certain decisions resting on mathe matical calculations, for example, invol ve no choice or judgm ent in carrying out t he calculations,\" the exception applies whe n the \"challenged ac tions involv[e] the exercise of choice or judgm ent.\" Id. 4. \"[I]f the employee viola tes the mandat ory re gulat ion, there will be no shelter from liability bec ause there is no room for choice and the action will be contrary to policy. On the other hand, if a regulat ion allows the employee di scretion, the very exi stence of the regulat ion creates a strong pre sumpti on that a discretionary act a uthorized by the regulat ion involves co nsideration of the same poli cies whic h led to the promulgati on of the regulat ions.\" Id. at 324. 5. \"The focus of the inquiry is not on the agent' s subjective intent in exercising [discretion], but on the nature of the actions taken an d on whet her they are susceptible to policy anal ysis.\" Id. at 325. Thus, as the courts largely hel d before and have uni formly held after the Gaube rt decision, there need not be a demonst ration of a conscious decision to carry out or not to carry out a particular action for a matte r to be within Prong Two. See, e.g., Shan sky v. Un ited States, 164 F.3d 689, 692 (1st Cir. 199 9) (noting that in light of Gaube rt, the \"critical question is whet her the acts or omissi ons that form the basis of the suit are susceptible to a policy-driven ana lysis, not whet her they were the end produc t of a policy-driven ana lysis\"); Miller v. Uni ted States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 (9th Cir. 199 8) (the challenged co nduc t \"need not be actually grounde d in policy considerations, but must be, by it s nature, susceptible to a policy anal ysis\" ); In re Cons ol. U.S. At mosp heric Testing Li tig., 820 F.2 d 982, 99 8-99 (9th Cir. 198 7) (a pre- Gaube rt decision citing case s in several circuits affirming th at the focus of the inquiry should be on the nature of the government' s action and whet her that action wa s susceptible to policy anal ysis) . C. Application of the Gaubert criteria Where does all this leave us in determining wheth er a case should be dismissed on d iscretionary function exception ground s, wh en there are no viol ations of self-imposed , specific, and mandat ory obligations? Some case law stands for the propos ition that cost alone cannot be a basis for a failure to 22 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011act. However , that propos ition does not pass muster because situations certainly exis t where the cost of acting m ay be s o high that the government i s willing, as a policy m atter, to take th e chance that a bad thing will not happen. See Nat'l Union Fi re Ins. v. United States, 115 F.3d 1415, 14 22 (9th Cir. 199 7) (reconciling conf licting st atements about cost in ARA Le isure Services v. Un ited States, 831 F.2d 193, 195 (9th Cir. 1987) and Kenn ewick Irrigation Dist. v. Uni ted States, 880 F.2d 1018,1028 (9th Cir. 1989 )). In the National Union case, the court stated that \"whe re a statute or policy plai nly re quires the government to balance expense again st other desiderata, then considering the cost of grea ter safety is a discretionary funct ion.\" As the First Circuit explained in Shuma n v. United States, 765 F.2d 283, 290 (1st Cir. 198 5), \"lack of due care in promulgat ing a p olicy, or i n having no pol icy or pr ogram at al l on an issue, howe ver imprudent it might se em, is e ncompassed within the discretionary funct ion exception.\" In Allen v. Uni ted States, 816 F.2d 1417, 14 24 (10th Cir. 1987) (involving nucl ear testing), the Tenth Circuit echoed this point, observing that \"[h]owever e rroneous or misguided [the government' s decisions] may see m today, it is not the place of the judicial branch [through th e FTCA] t o now que stions them.\" D. Cases where P rong Tw o appl ies In Elder, 312 F.3d at 1181-84, the Tenth Circuit set forth a compreh ensive di scussion of how to distinguish between cases that impli cate policy conc erns and those that do n ot. In that case, the court explained that \"the ver y exis tence of the regulat ion creates a strong pre sumpti on\" that the federal employees' decisions were ground ed in agenc y poli cies. The court, however, noted that \"the facts of the specific case may overcome th e presumption to whi ch the government i s entitled under Gaube rt\" and that \"[i]n certain circumstances, it may be ob vious that a decision impli cates none of the public policies that ordinarily inf orm an a gency's de cisionmak ing.\" Id. at 1182. Es sentially, th e test is whet her the alleged negli gence i nvolved a vio lation of a policy consi deration or was simply an ordinary ins tance of someone \"dropping the ball.\" Notwithstanding th e Ninth Circuit's observatio n in Terbush v. United States, 516 F.3d 1125 , 112 9 (9th Cir. 200 8) that \"[c]ourts have been reluctant to create formulai c categori es or to demarca te flashpoints on [the spectrum bet ween decisions that obviou sly implicate policy and t hose that obvious ly do no t] to illuminat e whi ch governmenta l decisions fall within the discretionary funct ion exception,\" examinat ion of the post-Berkovitz and post-Gaube rt case law doe s provide s ome guida nce. Claims tha t complain of negli gent de sign of f acilities are typical ly fou nd to be ground ed in policy and are thus insulated from tor t suit by the discretionary funct ion exception. See, e.g., Fothergill v. United States, 566 F.3d 248, 254 (1st Cir. 200 9) (court upheld dismissal of Postal Service customers ' suits for injuries they rece ived whe n another customer d rove he r car through the front entrance of the post office building); Riley v. Uni ted States, 486 F.3d 1030, 10 34 (8th Cir. 200 7) (court upheld dismissal of motorist's suit alleging Unit ed States Postal Service n egligent ly pla ced, maintained, and failed to relocate mailb oxes along highway); Shan sky v. Un ited States, 164 F.3d 688, -96 ary judgm ent for government wh ere visi tor to a national historic site sustained injuries after falling down a flight of steps); Kenn ewick Irrigation Dist. v. Uni ted States, 880 F.2d 1018, 10 27 (9th Cir. 1989 ) (claims agains t governmenta l decisions on the design of t he irrigation canal barred because such decisions were rooted in policy). Li kewise , claims that complai n of negli gent governmenta l plans for safety in na tional parks are typic ally fou nd to be ground ed in policy, and thus insulated from tor t suit by the discretionary funct ion exception. See, e.g., Merando v. Uni ted States, 517 F.3d 160, 165 (3d Cir. 2008 ); Baum v . Uni ted States, 986 F.2d 716, 721 -24 (4th Cir. 199 3); Autery ited States, 992 F.2d 1523 , 152 4-25 (11th Cir. 1993). In short, alleged gov ernmental negli gence i n the operation of government facilities will be insulated from tor t suit by Pron g Two i f the policy im plications of the alleged negli gent a cts or omissi ons can be demonst rated or at least articulated. JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 23Case s that involve inj uries allegedly due t o gov ernmental failures to war n of dangers i llustrate how c ourts treat the question of whet her the asserted negligenc e involves po licy cons iderations. In Wells v. Uni ted States, 851 F.2d 1471, 14 76-77 (D.C. Cir . 198 reviewe d the Enviro nmental Protection Agency's d ecisions made during an inves tigatio n of an area around three lead smelt ers. The court held that the agency's de cisions regardi ng the disseminat ion of information concerning lead risks to a nearby neighbor hood involved soc ial, economic, and political policy consi derations and we re thereby protected by the d iscretionary funct ion exception. Similarly, th e same cir cuit in Loug hlin v. United States, 393 F.3d 155, 164 (D.C. Cir. 200 4), affirming 286 F. Su pp. 2 d 1, 23 (D.D.C. 20 03), concluded that the government' s \"decision . . . m unitions without disclosing thei r burial during Wo rld War I or its immediate aftermath\" wa s \"fraught wi 164. Loug hlin also rejected the argum ent that the exception did not apply to claims that the government ha s an ongoing duty to warn and explained that a \"judicially cons tructed requirement t o rethink part icular decisions not to warn on a regular basis for over 80 years woul d constitute precisely the ' judicial second-guessi ng' th at the discretionary funct ion exception was intended to\" prevent. Id. Addi tionally, with respect to another kind of failure to warn - wa rnings of possible terrorist threats - the D.C. Ci rcuit explained that such claims implicated the we ighin g of pub lic policy conc erns. See Macharia v. United States, 334 F.3d 61, 66-67 (D.C. Cir . 200 3). This approach in dismissi ng fai lure to war n claims has been repeatedly taken by the courts. See, e.g., Hawes v. Un ited States, 409 F.3d 213, 218 -22 (4th Cir. 200 5) (maint enance and warnings regar ding an obstacle course on a military base) ; Demer y v. U.S. De p't of Interior, 357 F.3d 830, 834 (8th Cir. 2004 ) (warning of t hin ice on a frozen lake); Ther iot v. Un ited States, 245 F.3d 388, 399-400 (5th Cir. 1998 ) (failure to place a wa rning sign by an u nderwater sill in a lake cre ated by the Ar my Corps of Enginee rs); Maas v.

[whe re] the EPA m ade political, social and economic judgm ents pursuant to its grant of authority\"). 24 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011Sometimes l itigant s mist akenly st ate that the Supreme Cou rt's decision in Indian Towi ng Co . v. United States, 350 U.S. 61 (1955), provides a basis for asserting that the discretionary funct ion exception cannot apply to activities in furtherance of a decision that has already bee n made, r egardl ess of whet her a specific, mandat ory, an d self-imposed obligation has been viol ated. In Indian Towi ng, the U.S. Coas t Guar d failed to keep a lighthous e's light l it, causing a shi pping acci dent. The Co urt rejected the government's argument that \"uniquely governmenta l functions\" wer e not within the FTCA's waiver of sovere ign imm unity. Id. at 67. In the ensuing years , some courts relied on this case to support the proposition that once the government d ecides to achieve a goal, its negligent failure to fulfill that goal i s, a fortiori, outside the discretionary funct ion exception. But see Kennewick Irrigation Dist. v. Uni ted States, 880 F.2d 1018, 10 23-25 (9th Cir. 198 9) (disagre eing with such a proposition). Finally, in Gaube rt, 499 U.S. at 326, the Supreme Cou rt put this misconception to rest, explaining that the government \" did not even c laim the b enefit of the exception\" in Indian Towi ng. See Harr ell v. Uni ted States, 443 F.3d 1231 , 123 7 (10th Cir. 2006) (since Gaube rt, a number of circuits have expl icitly recognized t hat Indian Towi ng \"is simply not p ersuasive aut hority in t he context of the discretionary funct ion exception\") (collecting ca ses). If the Indian Towi ng case wer e litigate d today, it wo uld avoid dismissal based on the discretionary funct ion exception if: (1) government employees viola ted a specific and mandat ory instruction with respect to how to keep t he light l it (but that would be a Prong One, n ot a Prong T wo, analysis); or (2) the failure at issue was the result of run-of-the- mill (or according to the Cou rt in Dale hite, 346 U.S. a t 30, \"run of the mine\" ) negligenc e that did not implicate possible policy considerations. E. Cases wh ere Prong Tw o does not app ly Case s whe re government failures were deemed not to be susceptible to policy dete rminat ions invol ve various circumstan ces. One type i s an acute danger si tuation in whi ch no policy coul d be articulated for failing to intervene. See Andr ulonis v. Un ited States, 952 F.2d 652, 655 (2d Cir. 1991) (involving a fe deral scientist who o bserved t he plaintiff condu cting an experiment a nd wa s fully cognizant of the immediate danger po sed by the experiment, b ut failed to war n plaintiff of an imminent and clear danger). In that case, no p olicy for essentially failing to say, \"Hey, look out !\" cou ld be articulated. Id. at 664-65. Anot her type o f situation is wher e the government made a policy deci sion to war n, and the failure to do s o - wh ile not a viola tion of a specific and mandat ory re quirement - could not be said to implic ate a contrary poli cy. See, e.g., Ober son v. U.S . Dep' t of Agric., Forest Serv., 514 F.3d 989, 998 (9th Cir. 2008) (failure to deal with a known se rious hazar d prior to the accident in question was deemed not to be policy-based, in the absence of evide nce to the contrary); Cope v. Scott, 45 F.3d 445 (D.C. Ci r. 1995 ) (wher e government a ssertion that its failure to place a hazard sign on a p ark road could have be en for aesthetic reasons wa s rejected because it was shown that a parkway -wide decision for that stretch of road was to only use s afety as a c riteria) (distinguish ed in Loug hlin, 393 F.3d at 56 F.3d 1122 , 112 5-27 (9th Cir. 199 5) (government l iable for failure to post adequate warning signs t o protect divers i n a national park, where the failure to post at the location did not have any con ceivable policy basi s and a specific policy to p ost such war nings exi sted); Summer s v. Uni ted States, 905 F.2d 1212, 12 15 (9th Cir. 199 0) (government l iable wher e failure to war n about the dangers of stepping on h ot coals did not involve pol icy consi derations and wa s a departure from est ablished policies). These cases are distingui shable from the failure to war n cases cited above, wher e the discretionary funct ion exception was found applicable, because the policy implications in the earlier cited cases were not contradicted by m ore specific policy choi ces. JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 25Also outside the discretionary funct ion exception are cases in whi ch the government' s failure to act was the result of simply ignor ing an obvious problem, nam ely, where only the government wa s in a realistic position to address the problem and no policy implications could be explicated. See, e.g., Bolt v. United States, 509 F.3d 1028, 10 33-35 (9th Cir. 200 7) (failure to maint ain a parking lot on a military base whe re plaintiff was injured due to unplowed i ce was found not to have po licy im plications); Whisnant v. Un ited States, 400 F.3d 1177, 11 85 (9th Cir. 200 5) (disregard of \"reports and complaints describing the unsafe [mold] condition of the meat department\" in a naval c ommissary had no conceivable policy implications and therefore was not insulated from tor t suit by the exception); O'To ole v. Uni ted States, 295 F.3d 1029 (9th Cir. 200 2) (whe re the government i gnored routine maint enance of an irrigatio n syst em, caus ing a r iver to back up and seriously damag e plaintiffs' land, wh ere the government delegate d that responsibility to an Indian tribe and wa s aware that the tribe wa s not fulfilling its obligations); Marlys Bear Medicine v.

Un ited States, 211 F.3d 749, 756 -57 (3d Ci r. 2000) (inadequate lighting in a parking lot next to a national historic site whe re no wa rnings of dangers we re given fell outside the exception because such war nings would not have be en inconsistent with \"returning the area to its historic appearance\"); Goth a v. United States, 115 F.3d 176, 181 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding that the exception is no shield to a claim of negli gence i n failing to pr ovide h andrails or adequate lightin g on a footpath); In re Glac ier Bay, 71 F.3d 1447 , 145 3 (9th Cir. 199 5) (spacing of sounding lin es in charting of inlet was simply a m atter of \"scientific hydrograp hic judgm ent\" with no policy im plications). The reader may have obs erved the number o f Ninth Circuit cases in whi ch the government' s Prong T wo arguments have been rejected. However, it is notewor thy th at these cases are distingui shable from situations in which policy im plications can be articulated. F. Problem s with Gaubert analysi s in some Ninth Circuit opin ions Pane ls in the Ninth Circuit sometimes veer away fr om the teachings of Gaube rt. As n oted earlier, there is no s uch thing as an \"operational/planning\" di stinction in the Prong Two a nalysis. See supra Part IV.B.2. W hile the facts as understood by the panels in cases like Whisnant, O'To ole, and Bear Medicine, supra, may have war ranted the results reached, the panels' discussion of the legal s tandards is questionable. In Bear Medicine, a panel held that the \"decision to adopt safety prec autions may be based in policy consi derations, but the implementa tion [S]afety measures, once unde rtaken, c annot be short changed in the name of policy.\" Bear Medicine, 241 F.3d at 1215, 12 16-17. This statement was , in effect, an attempted resurrection of the Gaube rt-discredited operational/planning distinction. A later panel, in Whisnant, sought t o refine the Bear Medicine statement by add ing th at \"[o]ur case law reveals one exception . . . to the design/implementation distinction: The implementation of a government po licy is shielded wher e the implementation itself implicates policy . .\" 1182 (emphasi s in the original ). That refinement h ews closer to Gaube rt, although it comes perilously close to reversi ng the Gaube rt presumpti on that government actions that are part of an authorized p rogra m and have no t viol ated a specific, mandat ory, an d self-imposed obligation are within the discretionary funct ion exception. See supra Part IV.B.4. See generally Irving v. Uni ted States, 162 F.3d 154, 182 (1st Cir. 199 8) (en banc) (where the maj ority det ermined that the activity in que stion was insulated from tor t suit by Pron g Two, but the dissent took the vie w that the maj ority had erroneously treated the presumpti on as irrefutable). While the Ni nth Circuit panel in Terbush v. United States, 516 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir. 200 8), appeared to recognize thi s tension between some Nin th Circuit cases and Gaube rt on this point, it ruled that \"there still must be some suppo rt in the record that the decisions taken ar e 'susceptible' to policy analysis for the discretionary funct ion exception to apply.\" Id. at 1134. The tension between this Ninth 26 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011Circuit precedent and the Supreme Cou rt's admonit ions in Gaube rt may be qu ite limite d because the context of this statement in Terbush seems to l imit t he exception to wha t a court may view as matters of routine maint enance. See also Bailey v. Uni ted States, 623 F.3d 855, 861 -63 (9th Cir. 201 0) (finding th at Whisnant did not require revers al of a district court discretionary funct ion exception dismissa l, over a dissent by Whisnant's author).

Cir . 200 4), about its earlier decision in Cope provides a useful framework tha t reconciles the facts of the vari ous decisions. In Cope v. Scott, 45 F.3d 445 (D.C. Ci r. 1995 ), the dispute was whet her the absence of a wa rning sign on a winding road , whi ch wa s also a comm uter route, in a national park was ac tionable negli gence u nder the FTCA or whet her the failure to post the wa rning sign was protected under Prong T wo. T he government a rgued t hat aesthetic considerations were impli cated in the failure to post the war ning sign and therefore the exception applied. Plaintiff, however, was able to show that the Park Ser vice h ad already made a decision that safety would t rump aes thetics because the commuter route was replete with similar signs. T he Loug hlin court explained that in Cope \"the presence of no less than 23 signs on t he same str ip of road was probative of the nature of the decision to place an additional warning sign, bec ause it demonstr ated that the Government was not concerned with preserving a pr istine vie w on t he particular stretch of road.\" Loug hlin, 393 F.3d at 166. The plaintiff rebutted the presumpti on that policy was impli cated and could thus proceed wi th the suit because the government wa s unable to show an ythin g to t he contrary i.e., that, notwithstanding th e policy choi ce sugg ested by the Pa rk Ser vice' s actions, another policy choic e could have be en implicated wi th respect to the location at issue. So , the followin g framework ought t o gov ern any dis pute on Prong Two wher e there is no actual evidenc e of a conscious policy deci sion: 1. As a gener al matter, actions are presumed to be susceptible to policy anal ysis if policy considerations can be articulated, regardl ess of whet her it can be shown that they were actually cons idered. The burden is on the plaintiff to demonst rate otherwise. (Where no policy consi deration can be articulated, as in Andr ited States, 952 F.2d 652, 655 (2d Cir. 199 1), the exception does not apply.) 2. However, if it can be shown that a policy deci sion contrary to that articulated by government counsel had, in fact, been made a nd that the allegedly negli gent a cts or omissions were counter to that policy, then the burden shifts to the government t o affirmati vely show t hat the other policies were part of the mix. 3. If the government i s unable to meet t he burden that has been shifted to it, then the exception does not bar the suit. In any event, as a matt er of sound litigation strategy, when a determination has been made by government counsel that the discretionary funct ion exception should be raised, every eff ort should be made to identify part icular facts whi ch suppo rt the propos ition that the negligence at issue was susceptible to policy judgm ents. H. \"Technical\" d ecisions A related question arises when plaintiffs argue tha t the alleged ne gligence only involved technical or scientific judgm ents, wh ich inherently have no po licy im plications. Gaube rt rejected that notion. See supra Part IV.B.3. The mere fact that a judgm ent is characterized a s technical or scientific does not, a fortiori, remove it from the discretionary funct ion exception's umbrel la because these JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 27judgm ents may still implicate policy conc erns. As Gaube rt explained, whi le it \"may be that certain decisions resting on mathe matical calculations, for example, invol ve no ch oice or judgm ent in carrying out the calculations,\" a \"technical\" decision can still have po licy im plications. 499 U.S. at 331. The question in any given cas e is whe ther such impli cations can be articulated; if so, then the matt er falls within the discretionary funct ion exception. See Kenn ewick Irrigation Dist. v. Uni ted States, 880 F.2d 1018 , 103 1 (1989 ) (wher e most o f the allegati ons were rejected on discretionary funct ion exception grounds but one claim was deemed to be outside the exception because it was based solely on t echnical considerations). In other instances, howe ver, t echnical decisions may have po licy im plications that bring them within Prong Two . V. If the discretionary function exception applies, then the district court does not have jurisdiction over the case. The district court does not have j urisdiction over a n FT CA cas e if the alleged ne gligence comes within the ambit of the discretionary funct ion exception. See, e.g., Freeman v. Uni ted States, 556 F.3d 326, 334-35 (5th Cir. 200 9); CNA v. Un ited States, 535 F.3d 132, 144 (3d Cir. 2008); Hins ley v. Standing Rock Child Protective Services, 516 F.3d 668, 672 (8th Cir. 200 8); Garc ia v. . Air 117 v. United States, 468 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 200 6); Shar p v. United States, 401 F.3d 440, 443 (6th Cir. 200 5); Loug hlin v. United States, 393 F.3d 155, 158 (D.C. Cir. 200 4); Wang v. Uni ted States, 61 Fed. Appx. 757, 759 (2d Cir. 2003); GATX/A States, 286 F.3d 1168 , 117 3 (9th Cir. 200 2); OSI, Inc. v. Uni ted States, 285 F.3d 947, 951 (11th Cir. 200 2); Medina v. Uni ted States, 259 F.3d 220, 223 -24 (4th Cir. 200 1). But see Will iams v. Fleming , 597 F.3d 820, 823 - 24 (7th Cir. 201 0) (treating th e exception as a defense, rather than a question of jurisdiction). Jurisdiction is a threshold issue and the separation of power s doctrine requires a federal court to determine whet her it has jurisdiction at the outset. See Steel Co. v . Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 9 4-95 (1998 ). Therefore, rather than deferring the issue to trial, the district court must resolve the discretionary funct ion exception issue first. In Steel Co., the Cou rt explained the funda mental import ance in determining jurisdiction, stating th at \"[w]ithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause. Jurisdiction is powe r to declare the law, a nd whe n it ceases to exist, the only fun ction remaining to the court is that of announc ing th e fact and dismissi ng the cause.\" Id. at 94 (quoting Ex parte McCar dle, 74 U.S. 506, 514 (1868)). Cons equently, di spositive m otions may be br ought u nder FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1) even i f there are facts in dispute. Where facts are in dispute, the district court may m ake it s own factual determinations without converting the motion into one for summary judgm ent. On a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, a court is not limited to the allegati ons of the complaint, but may cons ider mater ials outside of the pleadings. See Land v. Do llar, 330 U.S. 73 1, 73 5 (1947 ) (stating th at on a motion to dismiss f or lack of jurisdiction, a court \"may inqu ire by af fidavit s or otherwise, into the facts as they exi st\"); Williams v . United States, 50 F. 3d 299, 3 04 (4th Cir. 199 5) (on a 12(b)(1) motion, the court is \"free to weigh the eviden ce and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear the case\") (citing Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977)). In a motion to dismiss u nder Rule 12(b(1), the moving par ty may submit affidavit s or any ot her evide nce properly befor e the court . . . . It the n becomes ne cessary for the party opposi ng the motion to present affidavit s or any ot her evide nce necessary to satisfy its burden of establishing that the court, in fact, pos sesses subject matter jurisdiction. The district court obvious ly does not abuse its discretion by lookin g into this extra-pleading m aterial in deciding the i ssue, even if it becomes necessary to r esolve factual disputes. 28 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011St. Clair v. Ci ty of Chico, 880 F.2d 199, 201 (9th Cir. 198 9). Accord, e.g., Hedge s v. Uni ted States, 404 F.3d 744, 750 (3d Cir. 2005); Williams v . Uni ted States, 50 F.3d 299, 304 (4th Cir. 199 5); ALX El Dora do v. Sw. S av. & Loan Ass'n, 36 F.3d 409, 410 (5th Cir. 199 4). Some cour ts have c oncluded that they shou ld convert such a 12(b)(1) motion into a motio n to dismiss under Rule 56. See e.g., Garc ia, 533 F.3d at 1174-75. Ot her courts, however, hold that this view is inappropriate if they bel ieve tha t the jurisdictional issues are intertwine d with the merits issues. See, e.g., Williams, 50 F.3d at 304; ALX El Dora do, 36 F.3d at 410. As a practical matter, however, it may not make a d ifference in many cas es. See Baum v . Uni ted States, 986 F.2d 716, 719 (4th Cir. 199 3). On t he other hand, it is wise to style the dispositive m otion as one for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) and (h)(3) because, on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, a court is free to make fa ctual findings in the face of conflicting eviden ce - something it may not do o n a motion for summ ary judgm ent. It may be prudent, however, to style su ch a motion as a motion to dismiss o r, in the alternative, f or summ ary judgm ent. If you a re able to marshal your evide nce early in t he litigation, it may be wise to file a motion to dismiss i n lieu of an answer. At that point, if a plaintiff seeks di scovery, y ou may seek an a greement t o limit d iscovery to the jurisdictional motion, a sound practice. Su ch an approach saves th e resources of the parties and the court. Nevert heless, und er certain conditions, it may be wi ser to wait to file a discretionary funct ion exception motion until all discovery is c losed. VI. Burden of proof Beca use application of the discretionary funct ion exception is gener ally dee med to be a jurisdictional question, most circuits have conc luded that the burden of proof for establishing that the discretionary funct ion exception does not apply is on the plaintiff. See, e.g., Freeman v. Uni ted States, 556 F.3d 326, 334 (5th Cir. 200 9); Hawes v. Un ited States, 409 F.3d 213, 216 (4th Cir. 200 5); Wang v. United States, 61 Fed. Appx. 757, 758 -59 (2d Ci r. 2003); OSI, Inc. v. Uni ted States, 285 F.3d 947, 951 - 52 (11th Cir. 2002); Irving v. Uni ted States, 162 F.3d 154, 168 (1st Cir. 199 8); Kiehn v. Uni ted States, 984 F.2d 1100 , 110 5 (10th Cir. 1993). The Ni nth Circuit, however, takes th e view t hat the burden of proof is on the government. See, e.g., Prescott v. Un ited States, 973 F.2d 696, 701 -02 (9th Cir. 199 2). Othe r courts, howe ver, ha ve deemed t hat approach to be suspect in light o f the Supreme Court 's decision in Gaube rt. See, e.g., Sharp v. Uni ted States, 401 F.3d 440, 443 -44 n.1 (6th Cir. 200 5). In Hart v. United States, No. 1 0-1604 , 201 1 WL 690 67 (8th Cir. Jan. 11, 2 011), the Eighth Ci rcuit, recognizin g the divis ion in the circuits, noted that it had \"not yet taken a f ormal p osition on this precise issue,\" but set forth a series of circuit precedent suggesting th at it woul d agre e with the majority view. T he Seventh Circuit, wh ich recently concl uded that the discretionary funct ion exception is not jurisdictional, see Williams v . Fleming, 597 F.3d 820, 823 -24 (7th Cir. 201 0), has not reached the burden of proof issue. See Rothrock v. Uni ted States, 62 F.3d 196, 198 (7th Cir. 199 5). In any event, this split may not be as signifi cant in practice as it may appear in the abstract. What the Prescott rule does, in effect, is simply place on the government t he burden of coming fo rward with presenting a prima facie case as to the application of the discretionary funct ion exception. Once that burden has been met, t he responsibility for rebutting it then lies with the plaintiff. VII. Closing notes It is important to remember t hat the Torts Branch must a uthorize the assertion of the discretionary funct ion exception in any given cas e. Typical ly, th is authorization will be obtained from the Torts Branch's Federal Tort Claims Act Section unless the case comes wi thin the jurisdiction of one of the other Torts Branch Sections (Enviro nmental Torts, Aviat ion/Admira lty, Const itutional and UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 29Spec ialized T orts). The reason for this policy is to assure that the Uni ted States takes coh erent and consistent positions on discretionary funct ion exception issues. Not every cas e will be defensible based on the discretionary funct ion exception. A ca se may invol ve a viol ation of a pertinent self-imposed specific and mandat ory obl igation or a simple mistake tha t has no p olicy im plications, but each case should be inves tigated closely to see if the exception applies. Early dis cussions with agenc y couns el about the possibility of ra ising th e discretionary funct ion exception are always wise . Presentation of a discretionary funct ion exception argument will often require considerable invest igation and the earlier this is done, the better. If pos sible, consideration should be given to filing an early motion to dismiss i n lieu of an answer. Particularly when an early motion is filed, it may be po ssible to convince oppo sing couns el and the court to stay all proceedings (e xcept for discovery re lating to t he discretionary funct ion exception) pending re solution of the dispositive m otion. Sometimes ea rly pres entation of the discretionary funct ion exception argument, along wit h the supporting fac ts, may per suade oppos ing cou nsel to volun tarily dis miss. It does no o ne any favor t o expend litigant a nd judicial resources on a case that the plaintiff cannot win.\u0098 ABOUT THE AUTHO R \u0091Davi d S.

The FTCA pro vides that the Uni ted States shall be liable for money dam ages \" in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individ ual under like cir cumstan ces.\" (2010 ). es that liability is de termined \"in accordance with the law of the place wher e the act or omission occurred.\" 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 346(b)(1) (2010); see also Richards v. Uni ted States, 369 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1962) (applying choi ce-of- law principles of the state whe re the negligence occurred to determine wh ich state's substantive law o n damages wou ld govern in a multistate tort action). Although st ate law genera lly dete rmines the type of damag es allowe d in FT CA sui ts, the FT CA imposes certain jurisdictional limitations on damages. Bec ause these limita tions define the scope of the government' waiver of sover eign im munity, th ey cann ot be wa ived. I. Only money damages are permitted under the FTCA. A signifi cant limita tion of the oney dam ages\" are permitt ed. Fede ral district courts lack sub ject-matter jurisdiction under the FT CA to awar d equitable relief and declaratory judgm ents. See 2 Le ster S. Jayson & Rob ert C. Longstr eth, Han dling Feder Tort Claims, have i payment of lump-sum j udgm ents. See, e.g., Fran kel v. He ym, 466 F.2d 1226, 12 29 (3d Ci r. 1972) (\"The relaxation of soverei gn im munity ative co ncern, responsibility and po licy. If novel t ypes of awar ds are to be permitted agai nst the government, Co ngress should affirmati vely auth orize the m.\"). Acc ordingly, di strict courts lack j urisdiction to order the Uni ted States to pay fut ure periodic paym ents, to purchase annuity contracts to pay futu re periodic paym ents, or to establish a trust for the benefit of the plaintiff. See, e.g., Hill v. Uni ted States, 81 F.3d 118, 120 (10th Cir. 199 6); Hull v. Un ited States, 971 F.2d 1499, 15 05 (10th Cir. 199 2); Reilly v. Uni ted States, 863 F.2d 149, 169 (1st Cir. 198 8); Muensterma nn v. Uni ted States, 787 F. Sup p. 49 9, 52 7 (D. M d. 19 92). It is clear that district courts cannot apply state statutes mandating per iodic paym ent of judgm ents by th e Uni ted States. See Hill, 81 F.3d at 120. It is also clear that district courts cannot enter a judgm ent that woul d obligate t he Un ited States to mak e future periodic paym ents or purchase an annuity for that purpose. See Reilly, 863 F.2d at 169. Nevert heless, the Uni ted States may rel y on per iodic- paym ent-of-judgm ent statutes in some states to argue tha t all or part of a lump-sum j udgm ent must be paid into an account that will mak e periodic payments to the injured party with a ny bala nce reverting to the United States upon the death of the party. Th is argument is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), wh ich provides that the Uni ted States is liable if a private person, und er similar circumstances, \"wou ld be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place wher e the act or omissi on occurred.\" In Hill, the Tenth Circuit held that the Uni ted States was entitled to the private- party equi valent of Colo rado's periodic-paym rtain future periodic paym ents terminates upon the death of the plaintiff. Hill, 81 F.3d 118. The JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 31United States was entitled to similar treatment because a private defendant's obligation wou ld have terminat ed upon the death of the injured party. Th us, the Tenth Circuit ordered the district court to establish a reversi onary trust for those portions of the judgm ent that woul d otherwise have been subject to the periodic-paym ent-of-judgm ent statute. Id. at 121. This argument woul d probably app ly onl y to periodic-paym ent-of-judgm ent statutes that terminat e the tortfeasor's obligatio n upon the death of the plaintiff. See, e.g., CAL. CIV. CODE \u00a7 667.7 (2010 ); Colo. 4.5 6.260 (2009 ); WIS. STAT. \u00a7 655.015 (2009 ); see also Cibula v. United States, 551 F.3d 316, 320 -22 (4th Cir. 200 9) (holding that the Uni ted States was entitled to the private- party equi valent of California's periodic-paym ent-of-judgm United States, 478 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 200 7) (holding that the Uni ted States could properly invoke Washington' s periodic-paym ent-of-judgm ent statute) (\"The FTCA aut horizes courts to craft remedies that approximate the results contemplat ed by stat e statutes, and nothing in t he FTCA pre vents district courts from orde ring the United States to provide p eriodic paym ents in the form of a reversi onary trust.\"). Id. at 1092. Likewis e, although a district court cannot order the Uni ted States to establish a trust, Hull v. United States, 971 F.2d 1499, 15 05 (10th Cir. 1992), a district court has the inherent powe r to require a plaintiff to use a lump-sum paym ent from the Uni ted States to establish a trust, including a tr ust with a reversi onary int erest to the Uni ted States. In Hull, the Tenth Circuit ruled that, \"provid ed . . . the government satisfies its obligation up front in one lump sum, nothing in t he FTCA pro hibits courts from exercising th eir inherent authority to st ructure awards or to impose trusts or reverte r conditions to ensure that the damag e recovery is i n the best interest of the vict im.\" Id. (emphasis in origina l). The Tenth Circuit's opinion in Hull and its subsequent opinion in Hill, appear to establish a district court's inherent power to create a trust - wi th or without a revers ionary inte rest - in situations wher e it is in the best interests of the plaintiff. The Tenth Circuit in Hull noted that other courts have allowe d revers ionary trus ts to be established wher e the injured party has a n uncertain or shortened life expectancy. See Hull, 971 F.2d at 1506 (citing Roba k v. Uni ted States, 503 F. Su pp. 9 82, 9 83 (N.D. I ll. 1980 ), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on o ther ground s, 658 F.2d 471 (7th Cir. 198 1), and Nemmer s v. United States, 795 F.2d 628 (7th Cir. 198 6)). In Deas y v. Uni ted States, 99 F.3d 354, 360 (10th Cir. 199 6), the Tenth Circuit affirmed th e district court's award of future medic al expenses in the form of a trust with any sum s remaini ng at plaintiff's death revert ing to the Uni ted States. This decision is import ant because it was not based on the \"best interests\" test established in Hull or on the \"private- party equi valent \" test used in Hill. Instead, although not explicitly announ ced by the court, the decision appears to rest on the rationales discussed in Nemmer s and Roba k: the uncertainty of the vict im's l ife expectancy. It is important to note that in each of these cases, the Uni ted States was not ordered or required to establish a reversi onary trust or to be the grant or of a revers ionary trus t; rather, the Un ited States requ ired to pay the l ump-sum judgm ent into a trust which provided that any m oney rem aining in t he trust would revert to the United States upon the death of the plaintiff. More flexibility exis ts with respect to settlements. When the Uni ted States settles an FTCA cl aim or suit it can agree t o establish a reversi onary trust for the benefit of the injured party, to pu rchase annuities to mak e future periodic paym ents, or both, provided the terms of the settlement do not otherwise viol ate 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). In othe r words, the Uni ted States may agree a s part of a settlement to establish and fund a trust or to purchase annuities, provided its obligatio n is fully sati sfied at the time of the settlement. However , the Uni ted States cannot agree to make fu ture periodic payments directly from the judgm ent fund nor can the Uni ted States guaran tee future periodic paym ents from annu ities because that woul d viol the FTCA's requirement of lump sum \"money dam ages\" only. Th e difference 32 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011between settlements and judgm ents is that 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 346(b) places a jurisdictional limit on federal district courts' authority in FTCA sui ts. II. Damages are limited by the plaintiff's administrative claim. The basic rule, set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(b), provid es that an action may not be instituted for any sum in e xcess of the amount o f the claim pres ented to the federal agency, exce pt wher e the increased amount is based upon newl y disc overed evide nce not reasonably dis covera ble at the time of presenting the claim to the federal agency, or u pon allegatio n and proof of interveni ng facts, relating to the amount of the claim. In short, a plaintiff gene rally may not recover for more than the amount claimed. See, e.g., Lebr on v. United States, 279 F.3d 321, 329 -31 (5th Cir. 200 2). Addi tionally, plai ntiffs may not recover more than the amount claimed for each particular type of damag e. Fo r example, if a plaintiff claimed $10 0,000 in property dam age and $100,000 for personal injuries, and the court finds $50,000 in property dam ages a nd $500,000 in personal injuries, the judgm ent woul d be limited to $150,000, e ven tho ugh the total amount claimed wa s $200,000. See Koka ras v. United States, 980 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 199 2) (holding that property dam age is severabl e from per sonal injury and that failure to put a sum certain on admini strative cla im for personal injury doe s not prevent plaintiffs from seeking pro perty damag e whe re sum cer tain requirement was satisfied for such damage); Allen v. Uni ted States, 517 F.2d 1328, 13 30 (6th Cir. 197 5) (holding that the case was properly dismisse d wher e plaintiffs filed an administrative cla im for property los s but not personal injury or loss of consortium, yet f iled a complai nt alleging only per sonal injury and loss of consortium); Schwartzman v. Carme n, 995 F.Sup p. 57 4, 57 6 (E.D. Pa . 199 8) (whe re sum cer tain was listed as to property but no t to personal injury, pl aintiff could pursue property dam ages bu t not personal injury cl aims in district court). III. Punitive damages are prohibited. Section 2674 of Title 28 p rovid es that the Un ited States \"shall not be liable . . . for punitive damag es.\" In 1992, the Supreme Court clarified the punitive damag es provisio n of the FT CA. See Molzof v. Uni ted States, 502 U.S. 30 1 (1992 ). In Molzof, the Cou rt ruled that punitive da mages un der the FT CA should be interpreted according to f ederal common law. See id. at 312. Unde r the common law, a wards exceeding ac tual losses are not per se punitive an d may be recovere d whe n state law regards these damag es as compensa tory. Wher e, however, the award of damages dep ends upon \"proof that the defendant has engaged i n intentional or egregious misconduct,\" the intent of the damages is to punish the tortfeasor, rendering them unre covera ble under the FT CA. See id. In short, courts may not awar d damag es agains t the Un ited States based on the degree of culpability of t he tortfeasor. Two si tuations merit separate discussion. F irst, in wrongful death cases wher e the state statute provides (or has been construed to provide) only punit ive da mages, s ection 2674 limits the award to the \"actual or compensatory damages, m easured by the pecuniary injuries resulting fro m such death to the persons respectively, fo r whose benefit the action was brought, i n lieu thereof.\" See, e.g., D'Ambr a v. United States, 481 F.2d 14 (1st Cir. 197 3) (finding awa rd of damag es to be punitive beca use it included the ultimate valu e of the estate, an amount the surviving par ents wou ld never have ac tually rece ived) . Second, with respect to damages fo r loss of enjoyment of life, the Cou rt in Molzof held that an awar d for such damages t o a comatos e patient is not punitive, per se, and may be recovera ble under the FT CA, provided i t is allowed unde r state law. JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 33IV. The FTCA limits awards of prejudgment and postjudgment interest. In most j urisdictions, tort damages in clude prejudgm ent and postjudgm ent interest. In FT CA cases, these issues are controlled by fede ral law. T he FTCA spe cifically pre cludes awards of prejudgm ent interest. See 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 2 674 (2010). Acc ordingly, re gardl ess of state law, t he injured party is not entitled to an awar d of prejudgm ent interest again st the Uni ted States. Postjudgm ent interest is avail able on FTCA j udgm ents. The availa bility of pos tjudgm ent interest, the period of entitlement, and the rate of interest are prescribed by fed eral statutes. See 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 961 (2010) (rate of interest); 31 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 304 (2010) (entitlement) . Sec tion 1304 provides that postjudgm ent interest accrues only when t he Un ited States unsuccessfully appea ls an advers e moneta ry judgm ent and only if t he plaintiff has presented a copy of t he judgm ent to the Uni ted States Treasury. T he period of entitlement for postjudgm ent interest runs from the day th e plaintiff files the judgm ent with the Depa rtment of the Treasury to the day pr eceding the mandat e of affirmance by the court of appeals or Supr eme Court . If a plaintiff fails to file the judgm ent with this department, t hen he or she is not entitled to recover postjudgm ent interest. The rate of interest avail able on a judgm ent is determined by a f ormula set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. If a di strict court enters judgm ent that includes an awa rd for postjudgm ent interest in viola tion of 31 U.S. C. \u00a7 1 304 or 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1 961, the award must be appealed unless the court amends t he judgm ent to comply with these statutory pro visio ns. V. Attorneys' fees are not allowed under the FTCA. Attorneys' f ees are not allowed unde r the FTCA. I nstead, the FTCA imposes a statutory li mit on attorneys' fees: attorneys ca nnot \"charge, demand, r eceive, or collect for services rendered\" more than 20 percent of the amount of an adminis trative se ttlement or more than 25 percent of a judgm ent or a settlement of suit in litigation. See 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 678 (2010). This limitation on fees applies to all fee arrangem ents. In addi tion, the Equal Access To Justice Act precludes an awa rd of attorneys' fees in cases sounding in t ort. See 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 412(d)(1)(A) (2010 ). Attorneys' f ees in structured settlements are based on the final, actual cost of the settlement a nd not on the future expected payout, future guara nteed payout, or the present value of the settlement, if that is different from the actual cost to the Un ited States. See Wyatt v. Uni ted States, 783 F.2d 45 (6th Cir. 1986 ). Section 2678 provides a penalty of not more than $2,000 or 1 year impri sonment, or both, for any attorney who c harges, de mands, receives, or collects fees in excess of the statutory m aximum. Notwi thstanding thes e limits on a ttorneys' f ees, some courts have a warded \"costs\" to attorneys who s erve as guar dians ad litem for minors and incapacitated plaintiffs. See, e.g., Gaddi s v. Uni ted States, 381 F.3d 444, 476 -77 (5th Cir. 200 4) (affirming awa rd of \"guard ian ad litem fees\" to attorney who r epresented minor' s interests in litigation whe re parents were also plaintiffs); Hull v. Un ited States, 53 F. 3d 1125, 1128-29 (10th Cir. 1995) (affirming awa rd of \"costs\" to attorney who s erved as guardi an because minor had another attorney of r ecord and guardi an served onl y as \"o fficer of the court\"). These decisions are in tension wi th 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 412(a)(1), whi ch allows c osts under 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 920, but specifically exc ludes as costs \"the fees and expenses of attorneys.\" 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1 920 does not specifically allow costs for guar dians ad litem.\u0098 ABOUT THE AUTHO R \u0091Jeff Ehrl ich is a Trial Attorney in t he Torts Branch.

In passing FTCA, Congres s sought, wi th some exc eptions, to impose liability on t he Un ited States to the same ext ent as a private p arty unde r state law. Pr ivate party defendants, however, are rarely, if e ver, co nfronted wi th the problem of pa ying spec ial and economic damag es arising fr om the same inj uries for which they have al ready pai d or provided benefits or will pay or provide be nefits in the future. In contrast, the Uni ted States, due to its governmental role, frequently finds itself in a unique position as both an alleged tor tfeasor and a federal benefit provid er. Plaintiffs who a re injured by employees o f the Un ited States often are beneficiaries of, or eligible for, one or more of the many fede rally-funded programs tha t pay for or provide s ervices related to, among other things, h ealth care or disability. Provisi on of these benefits by th e Uni ted States to plaintiffs who enjoy the avail ability of these program s is unique among tor t defendants because private d efendants do not often find themselves i n the position of provid ing fi nancial or other assistance to tort victims. T he United States, on the other hand, is routinely asked to pay to rt damages to plaintiffs who are entitled to, have r eceived, o r will continue receiving Medi care, Medicaid, So cial Security, T RICARE/CHAM PUS, Veterans' benefits, or some ot her federally-funded benefit that compens ates them for the same inj uries claimed under the FTCA. T he purpose of this article is to explore how t he Un ited States, in its capacity as a tort defendant, can obtain an appropriate credit for these federal benefits whe n calculating dam ages in FTCA act ions. I. Collateral source rule and federal benefits The Supreme Court recognized t hat \"the extent of the United States' liability unde r the FTCA is genera lly dete rmined by ref erence to state law.\" Molzof v. Uni ted States, 502 U.S. 30 1, 30 5 (1992 ). See also Wilkinson v. United States, 564 F.3d 927, 934 (8th Cir. 200 9) (FTCA damag es are determined according to state law); Wakefield v. United States, 765 F.2d 55, 58 (5th Cir. 198 5) (compone nts and damag es in FTCA cas es are taken f rom the law of the state wher e the tort occurred). Thus, a plaintiff genera lly may rec over t he same am ount of damages fr om the Uni ted States as he wo uld recover from a private d efendant, so long as t he applicable state law recognizes the availa bility of t hose damages a nd the damag es are compensatory in nature. Molzof, 502 U.S. at 312 (remandin g for a determination as to whet her the damages pl aintiff sought wer e properly char acterized a s compensatory und er state law); Fort Vanc ouver Plywood Co. v . Uni ted States, 747 F.2d 547, 553 (9th Cir. 198 4) (FTCA per mits recovery of compensa tory dam ages un der state law). A critical issue when calculating dam ages r ests on reconciling the federal government's limited waiver of imm unity wit h its unique role in funding the entitlement programs to wh ich plaintiffs are JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 35already (or will become) beneficiaries. Plaintiffs and some cou rts cite state \"collateral source rules\" as the primary device to prevent the United States from deducting or offsetting dam ages a wards by am ounts that plaintiffs receive or wi ll receive in t he future from the Uni ted States unde r a variety of en titlement program s. See, e.g., Manko v. United States, 830 F.2d 831, 836 -37 (8th Cir. 198 7) (finding Soc ial Security bene fits were a collateral source and not deductible); Berg v. United States, 806 F.2d 978, 985 (10th Cir. 198 6) (finding th at Medicare benefits were a collateral source and not deductible); Siverson v. United States, 710 F.2d 557, 559 -60 (9th Cir. 198 3) (declining to de duct Medicare benefits). In its most basic iteration, the collateral source rule permits an injured party to r ecover m edical and other expenses from a tortfeasor, notwithstanding rei mbursement or paym ent of such expenses from a third party or fr om a source \"collateral\" to the tortfeasor himself . Appl ication of the rule depends on identifying the source of reimburse ment as separate and distinct from the tortfeasor or, in the case of the United States, as separate from the source used to pay an FT CA j udgm ent. The philosophy behi nd application of the rule has been described as follows: [E]ither the injured party or t he tortfeasor is goin g to r eceive a wi ndfall, if a part of the pecuniary loss is paid for by an ou tside source and . . . it is more j ust that the windfall should inure to the benefit of the injured party than that it should accrue to the tortfeasor. This conclusion seems to be based on substantial justice. This reasoning, however, d oes not apply in a situation wher e the collateral source is the defendant himself. Un der those circumstances no one get s a windfall and if a recovery were allowe d under those circumstances the result would be that the plaintiff would receive a dou ble recovery and that the defendant woul d be mulcted twice for the same item of damages. Olivas v. Un ited States, 506 F.2d 1158, 11 63-64 (9th Cir. 197 4), quoting Adams v. Turner, 238 F.Sup p. 643, 644-45 (D.D.C. 19 65). While some states have abol ished or reformed the collateral source rule, many j urisdictions still recognize i t. Thus, state law should always be consulted to determine wh ether the rule applies to a particular source, if at all. Cour ts determining the rule's applicability to federal benefit programs adminis tered by the United States have att empted t o differentiate between benefits that come fr om \"gener al\" revenue s of the United States - the same source from which FTCA j udgm ents are paid - a nd those that come fr om \"special\" funds that are supplied in part by the beneficiary or a relative upon whom the b eneficiary depends. See Siverson v. Uni ted States, 710 F.2d 557, 560 (9th Cir. 198 3) (distingui shing betwe en benefits paid from gener al revenues , whi ch are non-collateral and deductible from FT CA awar ds, and benefits paid from \"special\" funds, whi ch are considered collateral and non-deductible); Over ton v. United States, 619 F.2d 1299, 13 07-09 (8th Cir. 198 0) (explaining the d istinction in treating ce rtain benefits as \"collateral\" and other benefits as \"non-coll ateral\" in FT CA cas es). A related distinction in \"special\" fund situations occurs when the plaintiff has made a contribution, whet her through payrol l deductions for a specific purpose or through premiums, and such funds are \"in the nature of insurance\" that may be likened t o proceeds from an historically \"co llateral source.\" Over ton, 619 F.2d at 1308. Appl ying this distinction, b enefits paid from g eneral revenue s with no special contribution by the plaintiff have bee n considered \"non-coll ateral\" and hence deductible from an FTCA awar d. See Carter v. United States, 982 F.2d 1141, 11 45 (7th Cir. 199 2) (deducting Ve terans' disability benef its appropriate wher e the V eterans' Administration is both the injurer and the source of incremental benefits); Mays v. United States, 806 F.2d 976, 976 -77 (10th Cir. 1986) (holding th at CHAMPUS benefits are deductible wher e plaintiff did not directly cont ribute to the fund used to pay thos e benefits). So-called \"special\" funds, howe ver, t o whi ch a plaintiff makes a contribution through payrol l taxes or programs tha t are otherwise likened to insurance proceeds, have typica lly been f ound to be 36 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011collateral and non-deductible. These programs inc lude Medicare, So cial Security, and civil service retirement benefits. See Manko v. Un ited States, 830 F.2d 831, 836 (8th Cir. 198 7) (Medicare and So cial Security); Smith v. United States, 587 F.2d 1013, 10 16 (3d Ci r. 1978) (Social Security); United States v. Price, 288 F.2d 448, 451 (4th Cir. 196 1) (civil service retirement benefits). The decisions declining to of fset FTCA awar ds suggest that the found ation of their holdings r ests in the legal ap plication of the collateral source rule under state law. Howe ver, f or reasons discussed below, a better read is that the Uni ted States, as a matt er of federal law, m ay be e ntitled to a deduction of, at minimum, the pro rata federal contributions to such benefits otherwise considered \"collateral\" upon a proper evide ntiary showin g. II. Using federal law and a properly developed evidentiary record to avoid collateral source issues Although st ate law, i ncluding sta te collateral source rules, applies to damag es in FTCA act ions, the government's waiver of sover eign im munity sho uld still be the starting poi nt when determining whet her a plaintiff's damages c laim seeks t o recover m ore than wh at the Uni ted States' waiver of immunity per mits. To this end, the Supreme Cou rt, writing only 3 year s after the passage of t he FTCA, declared that it now \" sees no indication that Congres s meant the Uni ted States to pay twi ce for the same injury.\" Broo ks v. Uni ted States, 337 U.S. 49 , 53 (1949). Thus, notwithstanding th e distinction that courts have m ade between \"gener al\" and \"special\" federal benefit funds, the above pr inciple is embodied in the FTCA it self and, c ombined wi th a properly develo ped record, may provide t he found ation for, at mini mum, a partial pro rata set-off even whe re a plaintiff has contributed in some way to the \"special\" fund. The basic principle is as follows: If the United States can prove t he amount of benefits that it directly cont ributed, then the \"source\" of the paid benefits can no longer b e considered \"collateral,\" even if the plaintiff has contributed to that source. Moreover, t he FTCA's waiver of imm unity woul d also preclude making the United States pay twi ce for the same injury und er these circumstances. Cons istent with this principle, the failure to obtain any set -off for federal benefits frequently has had less to do wi th the application of the collateral source rule and more to do wi th a simple f ailure of proof. For example, in Reilly v. Uni ted States, 863 F.2d 149, 163 (1st Cir. 198 8), the First Circuit affirmed th e district court's decision not to awar d a set-off for benefits under CHAMPUS, Medicaid, or the Educ ation for All Handicapped Children Ac t because the Uni ted States simply fa iled to develop a ny meaningfu l evidenc e regardi ng plai ntiffs' eligibility for the benefits or the amounts to whi ch they wer e entitled or had received. Id. The court noted that such programs see med \"strangely far afield\" from conventi onal \"collateral sources\" but declined to further consider the issue in the absence of a properly develo ped factual record. Id. at 163. Simila rly, in Siverson, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision not to awar d a set-off of Medicare benefits received by th e plaintiff wher e the Un ited States had not sustained its burden of proof on the issue. Siverson v. Uni ted States, 710 F.2d 557, 560 (9th Cir. 198 3). Despite its analysis distinguish ing gener al and special revenues when evalu ating whet her Medicare and other progra ms should be considered collateral sources, the court concluded that: The record here shows that the Uni ted States failed to sustain [its] burden as to either its contributions or the amount of benefits that [the plaintiff] woul d be expected to receive in the future. Und er these circumstances, the district court did not err in refusing to deduct Medicare expenses from the damage awar d. JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 37Id. Like Reilly, a proper evide ntiary showin g may have yiel ded a different result. In contrast, the Eighth Ci rcuit's decision in Over ton v. Un ited States, 619 F.2d 1299 (8th Cir. 1988 ), held that a plaintiff's FTCA damag es awar d must be reduced by any am ounts received through Me dicare, wa s reached in large pa rt because of the absence of proof that the plaintiff had contributed to the M edicare program. The refore, the court required that the medic al expenses that the plaintiff received f rom Med icare be fully deduc ted to avoid the Uni ted States having to pay twi ce for the same in jury. Id. at 1308-09. T he Over ton court expressly noted that even whe re a plaintiff contributes to the fund, \" [t]here may be c ases in whi ch the government i s entitled to a partial set-off, to the extent that governmental benefits primari ly attributable to special levies o r premiums ar e in fact attributable to genera l taxation.\" Id. at 1309. The court, however, relieved t he government o f mak ing su ch a showing wher e the plaintiff failed to show that she either made s uch a contribution or a contribution should be presumed. Id. (discussing the possibility of de ducting Soci al Security bene fits to the extent the government meets its burden of proving the amounts that the government i tself contributes to the paym ent of such benefits). See also Demps ey v. Uni ted States, 32 F.3d 1490 , 149 5-96 (11th Cir. 1994) (affirming se t-off for CHAM PUS be nefits based on s ufficiency of the government's evide nce). The principle to take away fr om decisions such as Reilly, Siverson, and Over ton is that a properly develo ped record that proves t he amount the Uni ted States has already pai d or will pay in t he form of benefits (or the value of the services furnished, as the case may be) for plaintiff's injury in creases the likelih ood of a set-off because it demonstr ates that the Un ited States is paying twic e for the same injury. Whether that set-off is in full or pro rata depends on the evidenc e itself. Ho wever, t he principle that the United States should not pay twic e for the same injury, en unciated by the Supr eme Court in Broo ks v. United States, 337 U.S. 49 (1949), clearly requires a court to deduct from an FTCA awar d those amounts that the Un ited States can prove have a lready been p aid or will be paid to the plaintiff under an applicable benefits program. Cons ider, for example, the Education for All Hand icapped Ch ildren Act (EAHCA) - no w codified as the Individual s with Disabilities Educ ation Act (IDEA) - that provides federal assistance to disabled and handicapped children. See 20 U.S .C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400-1487 (2010). In Scott v. Un ited States, 884 F.2d 1280 , 128 4 (9th Cir. 198 9), the Ninth Circuit declined to reduce an FTCA damag es awar d by benefits availa ble to plaintiff under the EAHCA be cause the United States had failed to provide a ny eviden ce of the value of the services avail able under the program. Id. In Ande rson v. United States, 731 F. Sup p. 39 1, 40 2 (D. N.D. 19 90), the Uni ted States again claimed the right t o offset damages und er the FTCA by the amount o f funding plai ntiffs were entitled to receive und er the EACHA. Id. The court there, rather than rejecting th e argum ent under the collateral source rule, noted that the Uni ted States had not provided any dat a as to the percentage of EACHA b enefits funded by the federal government. Id. The court noted that the Uni ted States was legally pr otected from m aking doubl e payments to the extent that it could show what portion of the funding under the EACHA c ame dir ectly from the Uni ted States. Id. The court summarized a s follows: If a portion of the funding for Sout h Dakota benefits [unde r the EAHCA] co mes from the federal government the Uni ted States should be allowe d to offset this amount f rom [th e plaintiff's] damage awar d. Fo r example, if Sout h Dakota provides a benefit worth one dollar, the Un ited States cannot offset this dollar from the amount o wed [ plaintiff]. If, however , the Uni ted States can prove tha t thirty cen ts of that dollar is provided by federal money, it c an offset [the plaintiff's] damages by thi rty cent s. Id. The court, therefore, offered an opportunity to the government to make an accounting of the sums that should be deducted from the plaintiff's FTCA damag es. Id. at 403. 38 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011A similar holding resu lted wh ere the percentage of f ederal assistance provided to a state for purposes of Medicaid payments was established by an e vident iary rec ord. See Lucius v. Uni ted States, No. 4: 04CV 1127 -SNL, 20 06 W L 325 7915 , at *8 (E.D. M o. Nov. 9, 2 006). In that case, the Uni ted States proved tha t the federal contribution under the Medicaid program was 61.0 6 percent. Cons equently, th e court found that the government wa s entitled to that percentage cre dit on the medic al bills that had been covere d under the Medicaid program. Accor dingly, upo n a properly develo ped record, the Un ited States can successfully invok e the principle that it should not pay twi ce for the same inj ury. III. The problem of future damages Three oft-cited cases have r ejected the government' s attempt to deduct future medic al expenses on grou nds that such expenses will be paid by the government as a result of the plaintiff's eligibility for government benefits in the future. See Molzof v. Uni ted States, 6 F. 3d 461, 4 67-68 (7th Cir. 199 3) (on appeal after remand fr om the Supreme Cou rt); Ulrich v. Hos 10 83-84 (2d Cir. 8); ted States, 337 F.2d 924, 934 -35 (3d Ci r. 1964). In Molzof, the plaintiff was eligible for Veterans' benefits, meaning th at his future care woul d be paid entirely by the United States at no expense to him or h is guardi an wh ile he was cared for in a VA clinic. The Seventh Circuit, despite evidenc e showi ng that the plaintiff woul d in fact receive fut ure care at a VA clinic, held that future medic al expenses are recoverabl e and wi ll not offset the amount the government must pay in damages. Molzof, 6 F. 3d at 467-68. T he court denied an offset for future care because \"[forcing] a plaintiff to choose between accepting publ ic aid or bearing the expense of rehabilitation himself is an unreasonable choice.\" Id. at 467 (citing Feeley, 337 F.2d at 934); see also Ulrich, 853 F.2d at 1083-84. T he court's rationale was that prohibiting th e plaintiff from receiving futu re care wou ld essentially rest rict his treatment to public facilities, with whi ch he may feel dissatisfied or whic h he may view as inferior to a private physi cian. Molzof, 6 F.3 d at 468. This dilemma wou ld \"deny the plaintiff the freedom to choose his medic al provider .\" Id. Addi tionally, the Molzof court alternatively held that \"the speculative nat ure of the prospective be nefits prohibits [the court] from off setting the awar d.\" Id. (citations omitt ed). These cases, however, addressed situations wher e the benefits to be conferred and received presumed th at treatment woul d be received by v eterans at VA hos pitals. In sit uations whe re benefits will be furnished regardl ess of wher e the care is provided or by whom , the plaintiff does not suffer the risk that his freedom to choose future medic al care will be preempted . To the extent that the val ue of these benefits may be proven, th e Uni ted States should argue for an offset to avoid the potential of paying twice for the same inj ury. See, e.g., Demps ey v. Uni ted States, 32 F.3d 1490 , 149 5-96 (affirming set -off for CHAMPUS benefits to cover fu ture costs of medication wher e evidenc e was sufficient). The other cited argum ent for denying an o ffset of future benefits is that they are too speculative to permit an offset. Molzof, 6 F. 3d at 467-68. Bo th future benefits and future damages, howe ver, ca rry with them an i nherent amount o f uncertainty. As t he Fourth Circuit stated on remand from the Supreme Cour t in United States v. Br ooks, 176 F.2d 482 (4th Cir. 194 9): We recognize t hat prospective di sability paym ents are uncertain in that the government may with draw or decrease them at an y time, but the uncertainty here is no gre ater than that involved i n many other matters affecting damages in personal injury ca ses; and the trial court must deal with it as it deals with other uncertainties by usi ng its best judgm ent after all the facts and circumstan ces of the case have be en taken i nto consideration. Id. at 484. JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 39Indeed, the future availa bility of fe deral programs est ablished by exi sting la w is, in reality, no more speculative than a plaintiff's case-in-chie f on future damages, whi ch is frequently depen dent on uncertain future health care needs, unknowabl e inflation rates, speculative m ortality and l ife expectancy projections, and/or hypothe ses about future education and employm ent. In many respects, the continued viabi lity of congress ionally-established federal benefit programs is more certain than a plaintiff's claim for future damages a nd any argum ent to the contrary shou ld be countered accordingly. IV. Practice tips The Un ited States bears the burden of proof and persuasion wi th respect to set-offs. Therefore, it is crucial to identify how to meet that burden of proof early in ca se preparation. The plaintiff's damages case should be examined closely to identify what federal entitlements, both direct and indirect, are avail able as to each compone nt of the plaintiff's past and future damages. Once identified, couns el should then determine whet her federal law, as referenced in Broo ks, can be invoked to demonstrate each instance wher e the Un ited States has paid or will pay twic e for the same injuries and damages cl aimed in the FTCA act ion. Next , state collateral source rules should be examined to identify whet her, as a matt er of state law, a n alternative argum ent for a set-off of federal benefits exists. Las tly, som e state laws pe rmit a set-off for damag es paid by non-feder al sources. Such laws apply to the United States in an FTCA action and should not be overl ooked. As to evide nce, past benefits are frequently asc ertainable through sour ces like the program its elf, billing rec ords, and agency cont acts or experts. It may be necessary with s ome programs, suc h as the IDEA, to ascertain the service s provided locally thr ough th e Individual ized Ed ucation Pr ogram. Wit h future benefits, close coordination with agenc y exper ts is necessary to de termine wh at service s and needs claimed in a plaintiff's life-care plan wi ll be covere d by the federal government and how much t hose services will cost. Exp erts may als o assist with understanding how c overage may change dep ending on eligibility factors that alter with time, such as age, an d in valua tion of such service s whe re the benefits do not expressly take th e form of monet ary assi stance. Lastly, it i s important to remember t o preserve the record for appeal. If an attorney is precluded from presenting evidenc e due to an adver se ruling, m ake an offer of proof so that further review m ay be sought in the court of appeals. V. Conclusion It is incumbent upon counsel for the United States to identify the federal benefit programs tha t have su pplied or will supply benef its to plaintiffs for the injuries alleged in an FTCA act ion. Once identified, counsel is in a position to devel op evidenc e and meet the burden of proof. Coun sel may m eet this burden through st atutes, experts, and other witnesses by demonst rating the amount o f money or t he value of services provided by the United States to the plaintiff through such programs, bot h in the past and in the future. Develo pment of proper evidenc e may help the Un ited States avoid s tate \"collateral source\" rules by est ablishing that the government' s own direct contributions, what ever t he percentage, are not collateral. The Un ited States may also avoid t hese rules by ci ting the Supr eme Court 's decision in United States v. Br ooks that held that regardl ess of state law, t he Un ited States cannot be made t o pay twice for the same inj ury und er the FT CA.\u0098 ABOUT THE AUTHO R \u0091Conor Kells is a Trial Attorney in t he Torts Branch.a 40 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011Defending Wrongful Death and Survival Claims Brought Under the Federal Tort Claims Act Jamie L. Hox ie Trial Attorney FTCA Staf f Torts Branch, Ci vil Division I. Introduction The purpose of this article is to provide a gener al overview o f how to defend wr ongful death and survival actions brought u nder the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). Ea ch state's sch eme v aries fa miliarity wit h the relevant state's framewor k is a n essential starting poin t to any wron gful d eath or survival defense. Be cause the nuances of each state's statutes cannot be fully addressed herein, this article is intended to provide a gener al framework, rat her than a state-by-state analysis, for approaching wrongful death and survival claims specifically unde r the FTCA. II. Overview At common law, a cause of action for personal injury \"di ed\" with the decedent and his family members had no recourse for their own p ecuniary and non-pecuni ary loss es that resulted from the decedent's death. Today, however, e ach state typical ly has a survival statute that allows a decedent's personal-injury cl aims to survive hi s death and a wron gful d eath statute that allows statutory beneficiaries to recover for their own loss as a result of the decedent's death. Because there was no comm on law ac tion for wron gful d eath, recoverabl e damages a re strictly limited to wha t is provided by statute and the interpreting ca se law. See, e.g., Turon v. J & L Con st. Co. , 86 A.2d 1 92 (N.J. 195 2) (noting that New J ersey's wrongful death statute creates a cause of action for loss suffered by the statutory bene ficiaries and if none of the statutory ben eficiaries have su ffered a compens able loss, no action lies). Wrongful d eath and survival c laims can not be litigated in a vacuu m and often require reference to estate law and personal injury la w. See, e.g., Jenkins v. Pat el, 684 N.W. 2d 346 (Mich. 2004 ) (applying Mic higan' s medic al malpractice non-economic da mages c ap to wrongful death actions). Wrongful death and survival claims are typic ally framed as either derivative or i ndependent of any cl aims the decedent could have brou ght at the time of h is death. Many, but not all, wrongful death statutes enumerat e beneficiaries, who a re usually family members. These claims are gener ally independent of the decedent and usually allow the statutory bene ficiaries to recover da mages f or their loss stemming fr om the decedent's death. By contr ast, survival a ctions are gener ally tho ught t o be derivative of t he decedent's personal injury cl aim. Gene rally, survival a ctions must b e brought b y a per sonal representative act ing on b ehalf of the decedent's estate. These claims usua lly allow for recovery by the estate of damages th at stem from wron gs the decedent suffered before he died. Since survival actions are typical ly not independent causes of action, any defe nse that woul d have bar red the decedent's claim had he not died wi ll usually bar a survival action, a s well. JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 41While wrongful death actions are typic ally dee med independent and survival actions are deemed derivative, thi s is not always the case. See Miller v. Ph iladelphia Geriatric Ctr., 463 F.3 d 266, 27 1 (3d Cir. 200 6) (noting that Pennsylvani a's wrongful death statute is part independent and part derivative of decedent's claim); Chomi c v. Uni ted States, 377 F.3d (6th Cir. 200 4) (characterizing Mi chigan's wron gful d eath statute as a derivative, not independent, cause of action). Some st ates have on ly one death statute that encompasses both derivative a nd independent characteristics. See, e.g., Stern v. Internal Med. Cons ultants, II, LLC, 452 F.3d 1015, 10 19 (8th Cir. 200 6) (discussing inde pendent and derivative characteristics of Missouri's death statute). Ad ditionally, whil e most j urisdictions view s urvival actions and wrongful death actions as complementary to ea ch other, other jurisdictions do not allow a claimant t o bring both actions. See Hend rix v. Daug herty, 457 S.E.2 d 71 (Va. 1995) (noting that Virginia law requires a person to elect between pursuing eit her a wr ongful death or survival action). III. Accrual of an action While state law det ermines whet her an unde rlying caus e of action exists, federal law gov erns the statute of limitations, including the accrual of the cause of action. See 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 401(b) (2010); Miller v. Uni ted States, 932 F.2d 301, 302 (4th Cir. 199 1). Not surprisingly, m ost circuits hold that a wrongful death action brought u nder the FTCA can not accrue before the decedent's death. See Miller, 463 F.3d at 272; Warrum v. United States, 427 F.3d 1048 (7th Cir. 200 5); Johnston v. Uni ted States, 85 F.3d 217 (5th Cir. 199 6). In some jurisdictions, courts have a pplied the discovery ru le to wrongful death claims and have he ld that the action does not accrue until the plaintiff (the beneficiary, not the decedent) knew o r reasonably sho uld have known of both the decedent's death and its causal conne ction with the government. See, e.g., Skwi ra v. Uni ted States, 344 F.3d 64 (1st Cir. 200 3); Diaz v. Un ited States, 165 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir. 199 9). In certain jurisdictions, wh ere wrongful death actions are considered derivative rat her than independent, courts have he ld that a wrongful death action can accrue prior to death if the injury and the cause of the injury ar e known pr ior to the decedent's death. See Chomi c, 377 F.3d at 616 (2-year p eriod to file admini strative cla im accr ued at time of decedent's injury, not his death, as the injury and its cause wer e both known pr ior to his death); see also M iller, 932 F.2d at 301. A sur vival action usually becomes a legally enf orceable claim when the decedent's underlying personal injury ac tion accrues because most s urvival actions are derivative of t he decedent's causes of action avail able at the time of d eath. Traditionally, a pe rsonal injury ac tion accrues at the time of t he claimant's injury. See United States v. Ku brick, 444 U.S. 11 1, 12 0 (1979 ); Attallah v. Uni ted States, 955 F.2d 776, 779 (1st Cir. 199 2). In some situations, then, a survival action will accrue before the decedent's death. If the discovery ru le applies to the survival action, the action accrues when the decedent (not the personal representative pla intiff) knew or reasonably sho uld have known of the injury and its causal connection. See Miller, 463 F.3d at 273. IV. Administrative claim requirements Making sure that the administrative cla im requ irements are satisfied for both wrongful death and survival actions is an import ant aspect of any wrongful death/survival action defense. W hile the FTCA and accompanying regula tions (28 C.F.R. Part 14) require that a claim be pr esented by one entitled to assert the claim under state law, most c ourts require only that a beneficiary under the statute or a person who e ventua lly becomes t he personal admini strator of the estate file an administrative cla im. See, e.g., Free v. Uni ted States, 885 F.2d 840, 843 (11th Cir. 198 9); Knapp v. Un ited States, 844 F.2d 376 (6th Cir. 1988 ); Boot en v. Uni ted States, 95 F. Sup p. 2d 37, 42 (D. M ass. 200 0); Byrne v. Uni ted States, 804 F. Supp . 577 (S.D.N.Y. 199 2); Van Fo ssen v. United States, 430 F. Su pp. 1 017, 1021 (N.D. Cal . 197 7). But see Johnson v. United States, 287 Fed. Appx . 328 , 330 (5th Cir. 200 8) (dismissi ng FT CA act ion because, 42 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011unde r Texas estate law, s ister failed to show that she had capacity to br ing a c laim on beh alf of decedent); Del Valle v. Veterans Admin ., 571 F. Su pp. 6 76 (S.D.N.Y. 19 83). Gene rally, under the FT CA, ea ch claimant must satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisite of filing a proper admini strative cla im. See, e.g., Muth v. Un ited States, 1 F. 3d 246 (4th Cir. 199 3). Whether a beneficiary may file an adminis trative cl aim for the benefit of other beneficiaries vari es depending on t he jurisdiction, but some cou rts base the decision on the legal a uthority of the beneficiary to act on the other beneficiaries' behalf. See, e.g., Estate of Sullivan v. Un ited States, 777 F. Su pp. 6 95 (N.D. I nd. 1 991) (widow' s administrative cla im form fi led with VA satisfied FT CA j urisdictional requirement with respect to children, even t hough t hey wer e not named in the admini strative cla im, as t he agency was given sufficient notice to commence an invest igation). But see Frantz v. Uni ted States, 791 F. Su pp. 4 45 (D. De l. 1992) (dismissing adul t sons' wrongful death claims because they did no t submit i ndividual adminis trative cl aims to the agency and p roduced no evide nce at the administrative level that the wife or attorney who bo th signed th e administrative cla im had l egal a uthority to act on the sons' behalf); Estate of Santos v. Uni ted States, 525 F.Sup p. 98 2 (D.P.R. 19 81). The approach set forth in Santos and Fran tz with respect to the administrative cla im requ irements of multiple beneficiaries is the more a ppropriate interpretation of the FTCA's jurisdictional requirements. Where both survival and wrongful death actions are asserted in a complai nt, the administrative claim should be examined to determine wh ether the claimant a sserted enough i nformati on to bring bot h claims at the administrative level . The level o f notice required to bring bot h claims vari es among the courts. Compar e Starr v. Uni ted States, 262 F. Su pp. 2 d 605 (D. M d. 20 03) (finding ade quate notice of wron gful d eath claim wher e plaintiffs asked wron gful d eath damages a nd whe re the cover l etter identified both parents, rather than estate alone, as claimants ), with Barr ett v. Uni ted States, 845 F. Su pp. 774, 783 (D. Kan. 1994 ) and Fran tz, 791 F. Su pp. a t 450 (declining to f ind sufficient notice of a wron gful d eath claim wher e family m embers were not identified as claimants and each family m ember did not state a sum cer tain for his/her wrongful death claim), and First Commer cial Bank , N.A., L ittle Rock , Ark . v. United States, 727 F. Su pp. 1 300, 1303 (W.D. Ark. 1990 ) (right to pursue survivorship claims was waived by fa ilure to present those claims during adm inistrative revie w unde r FTCA). Obvious ly, wher e either a wr ongful death claim or a survival claim has not been asserted at the adminis trative st age, th e claim m ust be dismissed. V. The status of the plaintiff It is important to unde rstand (and keep i n mind t hroughout the pendency of t he case) which individu als are authorized u nder state law to bring ea ch cause of action. W hile most c ourts are less particular about the legal st atus of the administrative cla imant, t he plaintiff bringing the wrongful death or survival action must b e the proper plaintiff as required by the applicable state law. W hen an imprope r plaintiff brings sui t, the court should dismiss t he case for failure to state a claim under state law. So me courts, however, have a ddressed this situation by allowin g the a ddition of proper parties to relate back to the filing date of the origina l complaint. See Goodma n v. United States, 298 F.3d 1048, 10 54 (9th Cir. 2002 ). If, howe ver, t he proper party has not timely filed an administrative cla im (or, after relating bac k, filed the claim befo re exhausting the adminis trative requirement) , the argum ent should be made that the proper party is jurisdictionally bar red from bri nging her claim. See Hace esa v. Un ited States, 309 F.3d 722, 735 (10th Cir. 200 2) (finding es tate to be jurisdictionally bar red from bri nging an ac tion because the claim either was not filed wi thin 6 month s or, if related back, the action wa s filed prematurely bef ore the adminis trative cl aim requirement was satisfied). In some jurisdictions, defenses unique to a specific plaintiff that woul d not have bee n avai lable agains t the decedent can still bar a death action. See Eaga n v. Calhoun , 698 A.2d 1 097, 1103 199 7) JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 43(noting that in a wr ongful death action, the plaintiff is subject to any def ense applicable to her, wh ether or not the defense applies to the decedent). The status of each plaintiff also may be import ant in determining wheth er that particular plaintiff can recover damag es. See, e.g., In re Greenwo od Ai r Crash, 161 F.R.D. 3 87, 3 95 (S.D. I nd. 1 995) (noting that children of decedent must have be en dependent on decedent to qualify as be neficiaries unde r Indian a law). W here a plaintiff or other beneficiary is involved wit h the underlying act that gave ri se to the decedent's death, the applicable state's law may bar the plaintiff or beneficiary from bringin g suit or recoveri ng dam ages. See, e.g., 740 ILL. COMP. STAT. 180 /2 (2007) (reducing and b arring cont ributory negli gent be neficiaries from wrongful 2 Ca rver, 314 S.E.2 d 739, 74 3 (N.C. 198 4). VI. The status of the decedent In many jurisdictions, wr ongful death and survival statutes include language to t he effect that, if the decedent woul d have been barred from bri nging a per sonal injury ac tion at the time of h is death, derivative cla ims and, in some in stances, the beneficiaries' independent wrongful death claims, are barred. W here a decedent's claim would have be en barred by the applicable statute of limitations, states vary as t o whe ther the derivative cla im is a lso barred. Compar e Miller v. Ph iladelphia Geriatric Ctr., 463 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir. 2006) (Pennsylvania law ba rs wrongful death action wher e statute of limitations has run on decedent's personal injury cl aim), and Miller v. Uni ted States, 932 F.2d 301, 303 (4th Cir. 1991 ) (finding a der ivative deat h claim barred if, at the time of d ecedent's death, he r personal injury action based on conduc t alleged t o have caus ed the death woul d have been time-barred), and Nelson v. Am. Nat 'l Red Cros s, 26 F.3d 193 (D.C. Ci r. 1994) (wrongful death action barred if survival action is time-barred), with Miller v. Estate of Sperling, 766 A.2d 7 38 (N.J. 200 1) (holding that jurisdictional or procedural matt ers that woul d have pre vented decedent from bringin g suit during hi s lifetime do no t also bar a wr ongful death claim, requiring only th at decedent's injury woul d have warr anted a personal injury action prior to his death). Jurisdictions are also split on whe ther a decedent's personal injury se ttlement or exculpatory release can bar a subsequent death claim. Compar e Stern v. Internal Med. Cons ultants, II, LLC, 452 F.3d 1015 , 101 9-20 (8th Cir. 200 6) (holding that beneficiaries were barred from bri nging wrongful death action under Missouri law by dece dent's personal injury se ttlement), and Grba c v. Rea ding Fai r Co. , 688 F.2d 215 (3d Cir. 198 2) (beneficiaries barred from bri nging der ivative wrongful death action under Penn sylvania law bec ause decedent signed a p ersonal injury re lease), with Schward er v. Uni ted States, 974 F.2d 1118 , 112 3 (9th Cir. 199 2) (decedent's previous personal injury se ttlement did not bar children's independent wrongful death claims), and Gers hon v. Re gency Driving Ct r., Inc., 845 A.2d 7 20 (N.J. Sup er. Ct. App. Di v. 2004) (decedent's release of personal injury li ability did not bar family's wron gful d eath claim). Ge nerally, wher e a decedent has entered into a personal injury se ttlement with the United States, all derivative cla ims shou ld be barred as a matt er of federal law. See generally 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2672 (2010 ) (\"The acceptance of any . . . awar d, compromise, or settlement s hall be final and conclusive on t he claimant, a nd shall constitute a complet e release of any cl aim again st the Uni ted States, and again st the employee of the government who se act or omissi on gave ri se to the claim, by rea son of the same subject matter.\"). No twithstanding the plain language of 2 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 2672, c ourts typic ally loo k to the applicable state law to determine wh ether a decedent's settlement ba rs the d eath actions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 (b) (2010). See, e.g., Montellier v. Uni ted States, 315 F.2d 180 (2d Cir. 196 3). Defenses that are personal to the decedent can also be raised in defense of a death claim. See, e.g., Sowi nski v. Walker, 198 P.3d 1134 (Ala. 200 8) (allowin g non- pecuniary dam ages t o the 44 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011beneficiaries only for t he period of time decedent woul d have been a minor ); Smith v. Gros s, 571 A.2d 1219 (Md. 19 90) (mothe r's wrongful death and survival claims for death of child agains t child's father were barred by the p arent-child immunity doct rine, whic h woul d have bar red the child's personal injury action again st the father). Ad ditionally, cou rts are varied as to whe ther a claim exists for the death of an unbo rn child. Compar e Pino v. Uni ted States, 273 Fed. Appx . 732 (10th Cir. 200 8) (allowin g wrongful death claim for non-viabl e fetus under Oklah oma law), with Marie v. McGre evey, 314 F.3d 136 (3d Cir. 2002 ) for wron gful d eath of fetus wher e fetus died before birth). VII. Death during the pendency of a tort case Deat h during the pendency of a tort action can raise additional issues. When a personal injury plaintiff dies during the pendency of a personal injury ac tion, a state's abatement do ctrine may v oid the entire cause of action and damag es awar d. See Bravo v. Uni ted States, 532 F.3d 1154, 11 70 (11th Cir. 2008 ) (abating chil d's $10 million personal injury awa rd because child died during pende ncy of appeal). But see Reed by Reed v. Uni ted States, 891 F.2d 878 (11th Cir. 199 0) (refusing to a bate award whe re plaintiff died after settlement was fully autho rized but before enforcement of settlement was sought). In some j urisdictions, the death of a wr ongful death claimant during th e pendency of the lawsui t may preclude recovery by the claimant's estate. See, e.g., Wackenhut Corr s. Co rp. v. de la Ros a, 305 S.W .3d 594 (Tex. Ct. Ap p. 20 09) (barring a ben eficiary's estate from wrongful death recovery on b ehalf of the beneficiary who ha d died during pende ncy of action); Lorn son v. Siddiqui, 735 N.W. 2d 55 (Wis. 2007) (claimant' s wrongful death action does not survive cl aimant's death unde r Wisconsin law). But see Bemen derfer v. Williams, 745 N.E.2d 212 (Ind. 2001 ) that beneficiary's wron gful d eath claim survived beneficiary's de ath). Once a personal injury pl aintiff has died, no new ad ministrative cla im is r equired if the beneficiaries of the estate or other proper parties want to convert the pending pers onal injury ac tion into a purely der ivative sur vival action that is merely a cont inuation of the decedent's personal injury cl aim. However, if a beneficiary attempts t o bring an independent wron gful d eath claim, the beneficiary must bring a se parate administrative cla im befo re filing sui t, even if the decedent brought a personal injury claim for the same all eged ne gligence during hi s lifetime. See Warrum v. United States, 427 F.3d 1048, 1052 (7th Cir. 200 5) (holding that a separate admini strative cla im for a wrongful death action was required to maint ain the action followin g the d ecedent's death); Raymo nd v. Uni ted States, 445 F. Su pp. 740 (E.D. Mich. 1978 ). But see Brown v . Uni ted States, 838 F.2d 1157, 11 61 (11th Cir. 1988) (finding a new a dministrative cla im for wron gful d eath action unnecessary). VIII.Conclusion The defense of wrongful death and survival claims under the FT CA re quires a keen unde rstanding of t he applicable state's statutory framework. Each state will have i ts own p articular requirements and nuances that apply to its wrongful death and survival actions.

Introduction The Un ited States, as a sover eign, cann ot be sued except strictly as Congres s has statutorily consented. United States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 53 5, 53 8 (1980 ); United States v. Te stan, 424 U.S. 39 2, 399 (1976); United States v. Ki ng, 395 U.S. 1, 4 (1969 ); United States v. Sherwood , 312 U.S. 58 4, 58 6 (1941); Neirbo Co. v . Bethlehem S hipbuilding Co rp., 308 U.S. 1 65 (1939 ); Hillier v. S. Towi ng Co ., 714 F.2d 714, 723 (7th Cir. 198 3); Stanley v. Cen t. Intelligence Agency, 639 F.2d 1146 (5th Cir. 198 1). One of the instances in whic h the Un ited States can be sued involves ad miralty sui ts. This article will address when and on wh at terms Congres s has allowed admira lty suit s agains t the Un ited States. There are four statutes that allow and circumscribe the Uni ted States' liability in admira lty case s: the Con tract Act (CDA) 41 46 C. \u00a7 0101 (2009); the Suits in Admira SAA), 4 6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30901 -3091 8 (2009 ); and the Public Vessels Act (PVA), 4 6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 31101 -3111 3 (2009 ). The SAA and the PV A provide l imite d waivers o f soverei gn im munity. T he AEA slightly broad ens the applicability of these waivers a s it extends admiralty jurisdiction gener ally. T he CDA r equires that suits concerning maritime cont racts will be subject to the SAA whe re it is not in conflict with the CDA. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 603 (2010). A fifth statute, the Clarification Act, 50 U.S.C. App . \u00a7 1291 (2010), modifies the applicability of t he SAA and PVA for a small class of seamen as explained below. II. Exclusivity of the admiralty waivers Where admiralty jurisdiction exists, either the SAA o r the PVA is the exclusive waiver of sovere ign imm unity. T he land-based and more c ommonly appli cable waiver of sover eign im munity ral says tha t \"section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to . . . a ny cla im for whic h a remedy is provided by chap ter 309 or 311 of title 46 relating to claims or suits in admira lty against the Uni ted States.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2680 (2010 ). This exclusivity is mirr ored in complementary provisi ons in the admiralty statutes. The SAA st ates that \"if a remedy is provided by thi s chapter, it shall be exclusive of a ny othe r action arising out of the same subject matter agains t the officer, employee, o r agent of the Uni ted States or the federally-owned corporation whos e act or omissi on gave ri se to the claim.\" 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30904 (2009). The PVA ado pts the SAA' s exclusivity cla use, providi ng that \"[a] civil action under this chapter is subject to the provisi ons of chapter 309 of this title except to the extent inconsistent with this chapter.\" 46 U.S. C. \u00a7 3 1103 (2009). The CDA a dopts the exclusivity ele ment of the above st atutes and thus becomes the exclusive wai ver of sover eign im munity for maritime cont ract actions. The provis ion states, \"[a]ppeals under paragraph (g) of section 607 of this title and suits under section 609 of this title, arising 46 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011out of maritime cont racts, shall be governed by chap ter 20 or 22 o f Title 46 . . . to the extent that those chapters are not inconsistent with this chapter.\" 41 U.S .C.A. \u00a7 6 03 (2010 ). The AEA stipulates that \"in a civil action again st the Uni ted States for injury or damage done or consumm ated on land by a vesse l on navigable wat ers, chapter 309 or 311 of this title, as appropriate, provides the exclusive remedy.\" 46 U.S. C. \u00a7 3 0101 (2009). III. Admiralty jurisdiction Beca use these waivers a pply to ad miralty cas es, a brief review of the criteria for such a characterization may be he lpful. The breadth of the courts' admiralty jurisdiction is subject to constant analysis and change, but the basic criteria give a good i ndication of the rough sc ope of admira lty jurisdiction. Adm iralty jurisdiction is defined differently in tort and contract cases. The criteria for admira lty tort jurisdiction were annou nced by the Supr eme Court in Exec. Jet Aviation, Inc. v. Cl eveland, 409 U.S. 249, 260 (1972) and clarified in Jerome B. Gru bart, Inc. v. Gr eat Lakes Dred ge & Dock Co., 513 U.S. 527 (1995); see also Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U.S. 35 8 (1990 ); Fore most Ins. Co . v. Richardson, 457 U.S. 66 8 (1982). In order for a court to have a dmiralty jurisdiction in a tort case, the tort must have a maritime \"locus\" and \"nexus\" for recognit ion as an admira lty tort . Adm iralty loc us is gener ally limited to \"the navigable waters of the Uni ted States,\" whi ch are those whic h \"form in t heir ordinary condi tion by themselves, or by unit ing wit h other waters, a continued highway over whi ch commerce is or may be c arried on with other States or foreign cou ntries in the customary m odes in whi ch comm erce is conducted by wat er.\" The Dani el Ball, 77 U.S. ( 10 W all.) 557, 563 (1870). The commercial highway s of our rivers, c anals, lakes bor dering m ultiple states, intracoastal waterways, ba ys, har bors, and the territorial waters we c laim offs hore are our navigabl e waters. The AEA extends the locus of admira lty tort jurisdiction to cases of damage or i njury on l and, including \"c ases of injury or damage, to p erson or property, caus ed by a v essel on n avigable waters, even though the injury or damage is d one or consumm ated on land.\" 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101(a) (2009). Fur ther, admira lty tort jurisdiction can extend inland through the application of a line of cases that liberally grant admira lty jurisdiction over t he claims of s eamen i njured ashore whe n they ar e acting \"i n the service o f the ship.\" Hops on v. Tex aco, Inc., 383 U.S. 26 2, 26 3 (1966 ). Adm iralty nexu s is judged by two criteria: wh ether the gener al features of the type of incident invol ved have a potentially disr uptive impact on marit ime comm erce and whet her the gener al character of the activity g iving ri se to the incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional mari time activity. Grub art, 513 U.S. a t 534. As the holdings in Grub art, Sisson, and Foremos t demonst rate, these criteria may be a pplied quite liberally. For contract actions, if the \"fundamenta l nature of the contract\" is marit ime, the n it is a maritime contract. N. Pac . Steams hip Co. v . Hal l Bros. Marine Ry. and Shipbuilding Co ., 249 U.

The Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-426 (2010); The Oi l Pollution Ac 1990 (OPA) , 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2701-2761 ( 2010 ); The Park Act (PSRPA), 1 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 19jj (2010); The Carriage of Goods by t (COGSA), 4 6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30701 -3070 lawsui ts in admira lty on beh alf of the Un ited States. IV. Practice under the SAA The SAA sub jects the Un ited States to lawsu its through the se broad terms: Waiver of immunity: ( a) In a case in whi ch, if a vess el were private ly owned or operated, or if cargo wer e private ly owned or possessed, or if a private p erson or property were involved, a c ivil action in admiralty coul d be maintained, a civil action in admira lty in pe rsonam may be br ought a gains t the Un ited States or a federally-owned corporation. In a civil action in admira lty brought by the United States or a federally-owned corporation, an admira lty clai m in personam m ay be f iled or a setoff claimed agains t the Un ited States or corporation. 46 U.S. C. \u00a7 3 0903 (a) (2009 ). Like t he FTCA, th e SAA d oes not grant any sub stantive rights , but rather waives t he Un ited States' imm unity from suits cognizabl e under the gener al maritime law of the United States. The language of s ection 30903 arguabl y expos es the United States to any le gal cl aim that is properly brought in admira lty, but t he wa iver is limited in several ways. Suits under the SAA a re required to \"be tried wi thout a jury,\" 4 (2009), and \"must be brought wi thin 2 year s after the cause of action arose.\" 46 U.S .C. \u00a7 3 0905 (2009). An a ction unde r the SAA m ust be brought i n federal court. 46 U. S. C. \u00a7 3 0906 (a) (2009 ). Un der the SAA, s uits may be br ought a gains t the Un ited States but not agains t a federal agency. Williams v . Uni ted States, 711 F.2d 893, 897 (9th Cir. 198 3); Smith v. F.2d 449, 454 (4th 196 v. Hawk , 97 F.R.D. 45 0, 45 1 (D. Haw. 1 983). Venue is proper under the SAA in any Unit ed States district court in whi ch any plai ntiff resides or has its principal place of business. Where a vesse l or cargo is involved, venue i s proper where either is found. 46 U.S .C. \u00a7 3 0906 (a) (2009 ). Ad ditionally, th e court in whic h origina l venue is proper may transfer venue to any ot her district. Id. \u00a7 30 906(b). If adjudged liable under the SAA, t he Un ited States may be liable for costs and prejudgm ent interest at the specified rate of 4 pe rcent per year. 46 U.S. C. \u00a7 3 0911 (2009 ). No admini strative cla im requ irement e xists in the SAA when the provisi on applies ex proprio vigore to an admira lty tort for which a court woul d find maritime loc us and nexus. The SAA re cognizes that an action may be br ought i n rem if t he analogous s uit again st a private party woul d be brought i n rem, but a ny laws uit arising fr om allegatio ns agains t a public vess el of the United States wou ld implic ate the PVA. 46 U. S.C. \u00a7 3090 7(b) (2009 ). Thus, in rem suits under the SAA are somewha t anomalous . Act ions under the SAA a re gener ally in personam lawsu its. 48 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011V. Practice under the PVA The PVA's waiver of imm unity is less broadly drawn, allowing: [a] civil action in personam in admira lty [to] be brought, or an implea der filed, agains t the Un ited States for: (1) damag es caused by a pub lic vess el of the Uni ted States; or (2) compensation for towa ge and s alvage services , including cont ract salvage, re ndered to a public vesse l of the Un ited States. 46 U.S. C. \u00a7 3 1102 (a) (2009 ). The PVA provides that \"a civil action under this chapter is subject to the provisi ons of [the SAA] except to the extent inconsistent with this chapter.\" 46 U.S .C. \u00a7 3 1103 (2009). A lawsu it under the PV A genera lly proce eds just like an SAA s uit, but exceptions exist in the PVA's varying provis ions concerning venue and interest. Venue under the PV A is dependent on the location of the public vesse l giving ri se to the controversy on t he day sui t is filed. If the public vesse l is present in the United States or its territorial waters, then venue u nder the PVA is proper only in the Uni ted States district court for the district wher e the ship is found . 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 3110 4(a) (2009 ). If, howe ver, t he public vesse l subject to the suit is outside the territorial waters of the Uni ted States, venue u nder the PVA is proper in any dist rict in which any plaintiff resides or has an office for the transaction of business. Id. If no plaintiff resides or has an office for the transaction of business in the United States, then venu e is proper in any Unite d States district court. Id. \u00a7 31 104(b). A judgm ent under the PV A may not include prejudgm ent interest unless the claim is based on a contract providi ng for interest. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 3110 7 As with the SAA, no adminis trative cl aim requirement exists in the PVA. VI. Practice in maritime contract cases under the CDA The CDA p rovid es that contract actions \"arising out o f mari time contracts are governed by\" th e SAA or PVA \"to the extent that those chapters are not inconsistent with this chapter.\" 41 U.S .C. \u00a7 6 03 (2010). The Co urt of Claims' an alysis o f the legisl ative hi story of this provisi on led to the conclusion that Congres s intended to retain subject matter jurisdiction and venue f or claims on maritime cont racts in the vario us Un ited States district courts. Whitey's Weldi ng and Fa brication, Inc. v. Uni ted 5 Cl .Ct. 284 (Cl. Ct. 1984). The CDA' s jurisdictional prerequisite that a certified claim to t he Co ntracting Off icer be decided by the issuance of a Co ntracting Off icer's Final Deci sion prior to the filing of a ny laws uit applies to suits on mari time contracts in the Un ited States district courts. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 605 (2010 ); Bethlehem S teel Corp . v. Av onda le Shipyards, Inc., 951 F.2 d 92 (5th Cir. 199 2). Therefore, administrative exha ustion is required in lawsui ts arising fr om maritime cont racts with the United States. VII. Administrative claim requirements in particular circumstances While the SAA and PVA require no a dministrative cla im as a jurisdictional prerequisite, preliminary adminis trative cl aims are required in two sp ecific applications of these waivers. W hen applicable, the AEA a nd the Cl arification Act, 50 U.S.C. App .\u00a7 12 91 (2010 ), require an administrative claim. In a case for whic h it provid es admira lty jurisdiction, the AEA r equires that a suit \"may not be brought un til the expiration of the 6-month period after the claim has b een presented in writing to the agency owni ng or op erating th e vess el causing the injury or damage.\" 46 U. S.C. \u00a7 3010 1(c)(2) (2009). JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 49Where no public vess el is involved, ambiguity ar ises as to the identity of t he agency to whi ch the claim should be addressed and possibly to the applicability of the AEA's admini strative cla im requ irement, altoget her. While the requirement ha s been enforced in such cases as a prerequisite to subject matter jurisdiction, no published precedent for that proposition exists. The Cl arification Act applies very narr owly to merchant seamen employed by the Maritime Adm inistration of the De partment o f Transportation (MARAD), t he current incarnation of the War Shipping Adm inistration and the Un ited States Maritime Com mission, a nd requires a wai ver of sover eign immunity to be brought und er the SAA. P rior to such a suit, the Cl arification Act requires that the plaintiff secure \"a denial of a written claim\" unde r regulat ions promulgat ed by (2010). MARAD's regulat ions concerning adm inistrative cla ims of t he sort required by the Clarification Act are found at 46 C. F.R. \u00a7 327 (2010). Unlike tha t found in the FTCA, th e administrative cla im requ irements of the AEA an d the Clarification Act do n ot allow agency ina ction to toll the statute of limitations. Un der the administrative claim requirements of the AEA a nd the Cl arification Act, the statute of limitations continues to run as the adminis trative cl aim is submitted and considered by the a gency. Whi le the agency's i naction brings a presumpti on of denial after a specified period (6 months under the AEA and 60 d ays und er MARAD' s regulat ions for Clarification Act seamen), d enial must be shown an d suit filed prior to the expiration of the limitations period. Be cause the admini strative cla im requ irements in the AEA an d the Cl arification Act are jurisdictional prerequisites, McNeil v. Uni ted States, 508 U.S. 10 6 (1993 ), the administrative exhaustion requirement e ffectively sho rtens the statute of limitations for those cases to whic h the AEA and the Clarification Act apply. Rash idi v. American President Lines, 96 F.3d 124 (5th Cir. 1996); Loeb er v. Ba y Tankers, Inc., 924 F.2 d 1340 (5th Cir. 199 1). VIII. The discretionary function exception The SAA and PVA are subject to the discretionary funct ion exception of the Federal Tort Claims Act. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72 680(a) (2010). McMellon v. Uni ted States, 387 F.3d 329 (4th Cir. 200 4); Ther iot v. United States, 245 F.3d 388 (5th Cir. 199 8); Baldassaro v. United States, 64 F.3d 206 (5th Cir. 1995); Sea-Land Serv. Inc. v. Uni ted States, 919 F.2d 888, 891 (3d Cir. 1990); Wiggins v. Un ited States, 799 F.2d 962, 966 (5th Cir. 198 6). The discretionary funct ion exception limits the Un ited States' waiver of sover eign im munity by providin g that the wai ver wil l not apply to: [a]ny cl aim based upon an act or omissi on of an employee o f the Go vernment, e xercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulat ion, whet her or not such statute or regulat ion be valid , or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary funct ion or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Gover nment, whet her or not the discretion involved be a bused. 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 680(a) (2010). The discretionary funct ion exception \"covers acts involving an e lement of judgm ent or choice if they are b ased on considerations of public policy.\" United States v. Gau bert, 499 U.S. 31 5, 31 6 (1991 ); Berkovitz v. Uni ted States, 486 U.S. 53 1 (1988 ); United States v. S.A. Empre sa de Viacao Aerea Rio Gran dense (Varig Airlines), 467 U.S. 797 (1984). Sovere ign imm unity has not been wai ved wher e the challenged governmenta l action is a discretionary funct ion. The discretionary funct ion analysis is a two-part test. First, the court must determine whet her the challenged c ondu ct involves an element of judgm ent or choice. The relevant inquiry here is whet her a 50 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011controlling st atute or regulat ion mandates that a government agent perform his or her function in a specific manner . Power s v. Uni ted States, 996 F.2d 1121, 11 24-25 (11th Cir. 1993). The government employee's conduct will fall outside of the discretionary funct ion exception only if a federal statute, regulat ion, or policy \"spec ifically pre scribes a course of action embodying a f ixed or readily ascertainable standard.\" Autery v. Un ited States, 992 F.2d 1523, 15 26 (11th Cir. 1993); see also Ga ubert, 499 U.S. at 322-23. If the conduct is deemed dis cretionary under the first prong of t he analysis, the court must then determine whet her that judgm ent is of the kind that the discretionary funct ion exception was designed t o shield. The focus is on whet her the challenged ac tions are \"susceptible to policy anal ysis.\" Hughe s v. Uni ted States, 110 F.3d 765 (11th Cir. 199 7) (citing Power s v. Uni ted States, 996 U.S. 11 21, 1125 (11th Cir. 199 3)). Protected discretionary conduc t is not confined to the policy or p lanning level. Hughe s v. Uni ted States, 110 F.3d 765, 768 (11th Cir. 199 7). Moreover, t he Un ited States is not required to prove tha t particular policy fact ors were in fact balanced during the course of making the challenged d ecision because policy deci sions fall under the discretionary funct ion exception \"whe ther traceable to a conscious decision or not.\" Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. Uni ted States, 919 F.2d 888, 892 (3d Cir. 1990); see also Uni ted States Fidelity & Guar anty Co. v. Un ited States, 837 F.2d 116, 120 -21 (3d Ci r. 1988). IX. Conclusion The Suits in Admira lty Act an d Pub lic Vessels Act, as extended by the Adm iralty Ext ension Act and Cont ract Disputes Act, are broad waivers o f soverei gn im munity allowing a wid e range of substantive cl aims agains t the soverei gn. T hey ar e, however, limited wa ivers , subject to their own procedural restrictions and the discretionary funct ion analysis required by the FTCA's language. T he genera l mari time law of the Uni ted States supplies the substantive pr ecedents under which lawsu its properly bro ught un der these waivers o f soverei gn im munity are decided.

Introduction Legisl ative hi story is consulted whe n attorneys an d judges n eed to determine why Congress enacted a particular law or to aid in the interpretation of that law or one of its provisi ons. Cour ts first strive for a \"plain reading\" of the statute. However , if the language is ambiguous, t hen the bills, hearings, reports, debate, and other documents that are part of the legisl ative record may be us ed to yiel d important clues regardi ng the state's intent. Researching legisl ative hi story ca n be a time-consuming and f requently fruitless endeavor. Congres sional documents often provide a n answer for why Cong ress enacted a particular law but are ordinarily less helpful when determining what Congres s meant by a sp ecific wor d or phrase. The legisl ative hi story of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) i s even m ore difficult to research than most laws du e to the long his tory of fa iled legisl ation prior to its enactment. T his article will outline the history of the FTCA and provide gui dance on searching rel evant documents for it and other laws. Not e that the history bel ow is only a s ummary. For a more complet e discourse, see Chap ter 2 of Lester S. Jayson a nd Ro bert C. Admini strative and Judicial Remedie s (2005 ). II. Tort claims bills prior to 1946 For over 1 50 year s, the U.S . Govern ment could not be sued without its consent due to the doctrine of sover eign im munity. Wi th the passage of the Tucker Act in 1887, Con gress waived imm unity from suit in contract cases. However , for tort claims involving inj ury or damages in flicted by the government through an agent or employee, a judicial remedy was avail able in very li mited circumstan ces. During the second half of the 1800s and the early 1900 s, Co ngress enacted a series of statutes that provided r emedies in isolated situations. They inc luded certain claims in areas such as patent infringem ent, military and marit ime act ivities, injuries sustained by fe deral employees in the performance of their duties, and property damag e in limite d situations. For other tort claims, federal agencie s were authorized i n the 1920s to settle claims for relatively sm all sums of money ($500 - $1 ,000). Prior to 1946 , apart from the se rather limite d exceptions, those who s uffered damag e due to the negligenc e of a federal employee ha d only two o ptions; they cou ld sue the employee per sonally, or they coul d seek rel ief from Congres s through pri vate l egisl ation. 52 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011Thous ands of claims were introduc ed in each session of Congres s and almost a ll of the private laws enacted during thos e sessions were related to tort claims. On ce enacted, a private bill woul d provide either compensation or permission to adjudicate the claim in co urt. However , few of the private bills were enacted. The time and expense of these claims, wh ich required hours of witness interviews , document retrieval, an d in-person testimony , was considered disproportionate to the importance of the matters involved. Act ing es sentially as a court of law pl aced an undue burden on Con gress and was also an inefficient means of obtaining justice for the claimants. As far back as 1832, John Quin cy Adam s complai ned that Congres s was spending half of its time on pr ivate legisla tion for whic h it was ill- equipped. During the 1920 s and later, as the size an d scope of the federal government e xpanded, the number o f claimants seeking rel ief from per sonal injury and property dam age in flicted by gov ernment employees i ncreased expon entially. Attempting to remedy thi s situation, more than 30 bills were introduc ed between 1925 and 1946. With the exception of the 75th Congres s, a tort claims bill was introduc ed in ever y Cong ress from the 68th to the 79th. Many of the early bill s had similar characteristics, vesti ng, in var ying degree, the powe r of settling th e claim in t he Co mptroller Gene ral, usually with t he assistance of the Uni ted States Employees' Com pensation Com mission whe n personal injury and death claims were involved. A number of these earlier bills provided for the prosecution and defense of tort claims in the courts by the Com ptroller Gene ral. On e such bill (H.R. 9285 , 70th Con gress ) passed both houses of Congres s, but resulted in a pocket veto by Pres ident Cool idge on March 4, 1929 . The vet o was recomm ended by Attorney Gener al Sargent du e to the provis ion that authorized t he Co mptroller Gene ral to defend tort cases on behalf of the government. La ter vers ions of the bill were introduc ed wi thout that provis ion, but none passed both Hous es. In addition to the question regardi ng which office woul d represent the government, other areas wher e the proposed bills vari ed included jurisdiction, limitations on damages, pr oportionate liability, reimburse ment from the government e mployee, an d statutes of limitations. There wer e also at least 25 types of exclusions that were propos ed for vario us categori es of government employees and different types of activities. Despite the differences in the proposals, most had a number of elements in comm on. Portions of many of the introduc ed bills were ultimately incor porated in some form in t he act that finally passed in 1946. Gi ven al l the points of agree ment, it is difficult to fathom why it took 20 years to get t he legisla tion enacted. Howe ver, no t everyone i n Con gress supported tort claims legisl ation. Some fe ared that it would make th e government vuln erable to fraudulent and frivolo us claims and felt that the power to decide these matters should stay with the Con gress . In 1939, the Cl aims Divisio ns of the De partment o f Justice, in collaboration wi th other governmental agenci es, drafted a bill which was introduc ed and reported favorab ly in both Hous es, but the Senate failed to act on it before the close of the session. In January 1942, Pr esident Roosevelt sent a special message to Congres s advocat ing le gisla tion for adminis trative de terminat ion of tort claims up to a maximum of $1000 and by court action to a maximum of $7,5 00. T his message gav e the Ho use reason to once again c onsider the bill that had been drafted by the Justice Dep artment. Re newe d consideration led to sever al signifi cant changes by the Judiciary Com mittee. The Senate passed S.22 21 (77th Con gress ) and it was reported favorab ly to the Hous e, but it failed to come to a vote du e to the urgency of wartime business. Simila r measu res were introduc ed in the subsequent two Congres ses, but no final action was taken unt il the propos ed legisl ation was slightly modified and finally enact ed as Title IV of the Legisl ative Reo rgani zation Ac t of 1946. For a contemporan eous description of the legisl ative hi story of the FTCA le ading up to its enactment, see Irvin M . Got tlieb, The Federal Tort Claims Act - A S tatutory Interpretation, 35 GEO. L. J. 1, 1-9 (194 6). JANUARY 2011 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN 53III. FTCA amendments A series of amendm ents to the FTCA wer e passed starting in 19 47, s ome of which are listed below. The Federal Tort Claims Act (Part 3 Se c. 410 (a)) specified that the federal government, in awar ding dam ages, s hall follow \"t he law of the place wher e the act or omissi on occurred,\" yet s hall not be liable for punitive damag es. H.R. 36 90 (enacted as Public Law 80 -324 on August 1, 1947) removed th at restriction. In 1949, Co ngress lengthen ed the statute of limitations from 1 year t o 2 year s. Pu blic Law 81 -55 wa s enacted Apr il 25, 1949 . In 1959, Co ngress increased the authority of heads of federal agencie s to settle claims adminis tratively, ra ising th e ceiling fro m $2,500. Pub . L. No. 86-238, \u00a7 1(1), 73 St at. 471 (1959). In 1966, Co ngress again amended the FTCA's statute of limitations, imposing a mandatory re quirement that claimants exhaust all administrative remedie s as a prerequisite to suit and giving hea ds of federal agencie s authority to settle claims, regardl ess of their amount. In modifyin g the s tatute of limitations, it provid ed that a suit on a claim that has been denied must be filed within 6 month s. The amendment also made certain other changes. Pu b. L. No. 89 -506, \u00a7 7, 80 S tat. 307 (1966 ); Pub. L. No. 89- 507, \u00a7 1, 80 S tat. 308 (1966 ); and Pub. L. No. 89-508, \u00a7 3, 80 S tat. 308 (1966 ). In 1970, Co ngress passed the Emergency Heal th Personnel Act of 1970 \"to amend, t he Public Heal th Service Ac t to authorize the assignment of comm issioned officers of the Public Heal th Service t o areas with critical medical manpower shortages, t o encourage health personne l to practice in areas wher e shortages of such personne l exist, and for other purposes.\" The law al so made t he FTCA's assault and battery exc eption inapplicable to claims arising out o f negligenc e of an employee i n the performance of such functions. Pub . L. No. 91-623, \u00a7 4, 84 S tat. 1870 (1970). In 1974, the exclusionary pro visio ns dealing wit h \"intentional torts\" were amended, permitting sui t on claims agains t federal invest igative or l aw en forcement officers for assault, battery, fa lse imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution. P ub. L . No. 9 3-253, \u00a7 1, 88 S tat. 50 (1974 ). Congres s enacted the Na tional Swi ne Flu Immunization Pr ogram of 197 6, mak ing th e FTCA th e exclusive remedy for claims arising fro m this program. Pub. L. No . 94-380, \u00a7 2, 90 Stat. 1113 (1976). In 1988, Co ngress passed the Federal Employees Li ability Refo rm and T ort Com pensation Act of 1988 (\"The W estfall Act\"). It amended the FTCA to provide absolute imm unity for federal employees from personal liability for comm on law torts by substituting the United States as the defendant in any ac tion agains t federal employees acting wit hin the scope of their employment. It also extended coverage t o employees of the legisla tive and j udicial branches and the Tennessee Valley Author ity. Pub. L. No . 100-694, \u00a7 9 , 102 Stat. 4566 (1988). The Ad ministrative Disp ute Resolution Ac t, enacted in 1990, gave th e Attorney Gene ral the authority to empower agency hea ds to settle admini strative cla ims for an amount equal to that authorized f or United States Attorneys. T he Ac t also authorizes fe deral 54 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN JANUARY 2011agenci es to use alternative dis pute resolutions method s in resolving cl aims. Pu b. L. No. 101-552, \u00a7 4 , 104 Stat 2737 (1990). The Ci vil As set Forfeiture Reform Act o f 2000 was enacted to provide a fairer and more uniform procedure for federal civil forfeitures. It provid ed that suit may be brought f or the damage of p roperty det ained by the government: if the property was s eized in a forfeiture proceeding; th e interest of the claimant wa s not forfeited, remitt ed or mitigate d; and the claimant wa s not convict ed of a crime in t he related criminal proceeding.

Conclusion When researching a fe deral statute, the first step is usually to look for t he public law that enacted it. In the case of the FT CA, it tends to be a bit more c omplicated. If the USCA section you a re researching was ad ded as part of the 1946 act, you wil l most likely need to look at t he legisl ative hi story of the tort claims bills (especially tho se introduced in the 77th-79th Con gress es) to find the most useful documents for that provis ion.
