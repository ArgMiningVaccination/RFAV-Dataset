Medieval societies used a range of these natural substances to treat condi-tions clearly recognizable to the modern eye as microbial infections, and there has been much debate over the likely efcacy ofthese treatments. Our interdisciplinary team, comprising researchers from both sciences and humanities, identied and recon-structed a potential remedy for Staphylococcus aureus infection from a 10th century Anglo-Saxon leechbook. The remedy re- peatedly killed established S. aureus biolms in an in vitro model of soft tissue infection and killed methicillin-resistant S. au- reus (MRSA) in a mouse chronic wound model. While the remedy contained several ingredients that are individually known to have some antibacterial activity, full efcacy required the combined action of several ingredients, highlighting the scholarship ofpremodern doctors and the potential of ancient texts as a source of new antimicrobial agents. IMPORTANCE While the antibiotic potential of some materials used in historical medicine has been demonstrated, empirical tests of entire remedies are scarce. This is an important omission, because the efcacy of \"ancientbiotics\" could rely on the com-bined activity of their various ingredients. This would lead us to underestimate their efcacy and, by extension, the scholarshipof premodern doctors. It could also help us to understand why some natural compounds that show antibacterial promise in thelaboratory fail to yield positive results in clinical trials. We have reconstructed a 1,000-year-old remedy which kills the bacteria itwas designed to treat and have shown that this activity relies on the combined activity of several antimicrobial ingredients. Ourresults highlight (i) the scholarship and rational methodology of premodern medical professionals and (ii) the untapped poten-tial of premodern remedies for yielding novel therapeutics at a time when new antibiotics are desperately needed.

Antibiotic resistance is a clear and present danger to human health, and there are worryingly few new antibiotics in the developmental pipeline (1). A rich source of new antimicrobialspotentially resides in medieval and early modern medical texts:microbial infection has been a constant presence throughout hu-man history, and manuscript evidence shows that early modernand premodern societies used a range of natural compounds totreat conditions that are clearly recognizable as microbial infec-tions. Some substances used in premodern treatments for infec-tion (e.g., extracts from garlic [2-5]) show antimicrobial orvirulence-reducing effects under certain conditions, but experi- ments that test the antibiotic activities of entire historical remediesare few and far between. This is an important omission, becausethe efcacy of these \"ancientbiotics\" could rely on the combinedactivity of their various ingredients. This would lead us to under- estimate their efcacy and, by extension, the scholarship of pre-modern doctors. It could also help to explain why the in vitro antibacterial activity of individual compounds (e.g., garlic [6]) does not always reliably translate into in vivo antimicrobial poten- tial.Bald's Leechbook (7) (Materials and Methods) is an English medical text from the Anglo-Saxon period. The manuscript waswritten in the 10th century and contains remedies for variousailments, including clearly recognizable microbial infections. Me-dieval medicine has generally been dismissed as backwards or su-perstitious, but recent scholars have suggested that among theremedies there may be methods and recipes that indicate a morefactual application (8-10). One of Bald's remedies, a salve for a\"wen\" or lump in the eye (Fig. 1), is particularly interesting to themodern microbiologist. It aims to treat a condition caused bybacterial infection and contains ingredients with the potential forantimicrobial activity. The recipe instructs the reader to crushgarlic and a second Allium species (whose translation into modern English is ambiguous), combine these with wine and oxgall (bo-vine bile), and leave the mixture to stand in a brass or bronze vesselfor 9 days and nights. The \"wen\" is most likely a sty: an infection of an eyelash follicle. Today, most styes are caused by the Gram-positive bacteriumStaphylococcus aureus (11), which also causes other severe and persistent infections of various tissues. The spread of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains has exacerbated this problemRESEARCH ARTICLE crossmark July/August 2015 Volume 6 Issue 4 e01129-15 \u00aembio.asm.org 1(11, 12). MRSA is particularly associated with chronic wound in- fections, which affect increasing numbers of people and are oftenhighly resistant to treatment (11, 13). The ingredients combined to treat this infection appear prom- ising to the modern microbiologist. Allium species produce a range of antimicrobial compounds (3). Ajoene, which is found in garlic ( A. sativum ), ), may prevent biolm for- mation by S. aureus and other bacterial species (4) and interfere with quorum sensing and virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5). Other antimicrobial compounds produced by Allium species include flavonoids, such as quercetin, kaempferol, and porrum the antimicrobial peptide Ace-AMP1, so far only characterized in onion (14). Bile may also be antibacterial: it isgenerally thought to limit bacterial overgrowth in the host smallintestine (15). Wine may act as a source of plant-derived antimi-crobial small molecules or simply as a solvent for the extraction ofcompounds from the plant matter in the recipe. Finally, it is pos-sible that copper salts may leach from the vessel in which theeyesalve is prepared. Copper surfaces prevent bacterial growth(16), and host-derived copper plays a role in immune defense(17). Interestingly, there is evidence that Allium -derived com- pounds may act synergistically with other antimicrobial agents,including copper (18) and tobramycin (2, 5). We therefore sought to test the effect of Bald's eyesalve on S. aureus and to determine whether any antibacterial activity found could be attributed to a single ingredient or was reliant oncombining the ingredients according to the instructions laid downby \"Bald.\" (Our work was put forward as a poster/oral presentation for the Society for General Microbiology Annual Conference 2015,Birmingham, United Kingdom, 30 March to 2 April 2015.)RESULTS Reconstruction of Bald's eyesalve. We reconstructed four inde- pendent batches of the recipe (batches A to D; see Materials andMethods). For each batch, we made two variants of the recipe, oneusing onion (ES-O) and one using leek (ES-L) for the ambiguousAllium species .We chose these because they both produce antimi- crobial flavonoids that are not found in garlic, and onion alsoproduces an antimicrobial peptide (3, 19). We also made prepa-rations of the individual ingredients at approximately the sameconcentrations as they are found in the recipe (batches A and B),versions of the recipe with single ingredients omitted (batch C),and a version of the recipe which was tested before and after the9-day waiting period (batch D). All of these were prepared in glassbottles, to which we added squares of brass sheet to simulate thebrass/bronze vessel. The complete recipes resulted in clear, slightlyacidic (pH 4.6 to 4.7) brownish liquids. The full recipes were ap-parently self-sterilizing: we cultured bacteria from aliquots of theleek and oxgall preparations but not from aliquots of ES-O orES-L (see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material). Bald's eyesalve kills planktonic and biolm cultures of S. au- reus. As shown by the results in Fig. 2A, both ES-O and ES-L prevented growth of planktonic cultures of S. aureus growing aer- obically at 37\u00b0C in synthetic wound fluid (SWF) (20). Aliquots ofcultures were plated out at the end of the incubation period, andno colonies were observed (detection limit, 30 CFU). Further- more, 5 /H9262l of each culture was transferred to 1 ml of fresh SWF and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C, but no growth was observed, show-ing that Bald's eyesalve was bactericidal, rather than simply bac-teriostatic, under these conditions. However, during infection, bacteria often exist as dense, antibiotic-resistant biolms in a matrix of self-excreted polysac-charides and soft tissue from the host (11, 13, 21). We thereforegrew S. aureus for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in a synthetic model of soft tissue infection comprised of SWF solidied with collagen (20). We ex-posed the resulting mature biolms to batches A and B of ES-O orES-L or preparations of the individual ingredients for a further24 h (Fig. 2B). A generalized linear model revealed a signicanteffect of treatment ( /H9273271.5e/H1100110,P/H110210.001); post hoc Tukey tests showed that only the results for ES-O and ES-L were signicantly different from the results for the control treatment ( P/H110210.001), causing marked reductions in the numbers of viable cells recov-ered from synthetic wounds. None of the individual ingredientsalone had a signicant effect on viable cell counts. There was alsoa signicant effect of batch ( /H9273214.2e/H110019,P/H110210.001) and a signi - cant interaction between batch and treatment ( /H9273272.0e/H110019,P/H11021 0.001); this was because the full recipes of batch B were slightly more bactericidal than those of batch A, and the effects of theindividual ingredient preparations differed between batches. Thefull recipes retained bactericidal activity after 30 days of storage at4\u00b0C (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Bald's eyesalve is only effective when the recipe is followed carefully. We then made a third batch (batch C) of ES-O and ES-L, along with variants in which individual ingredients weresystematically omitted. These were tested against S. aureus in the synthetic wound biolm model. A generalized linear model re-vealed a signicant effect of treatment ( /H92732113.1e/H110019,P/H110210.001). We used Dunnett's test to test comparisons that were of interest. First, we contrasted the results of each recipe with those of thecontrol. Both ES-O and ES-L caused a signicant reduction in FIG 1 Bald's eyesalve. A facsimile of the recipe, taken from the manuscript known as Bald's Leechbook (London, British Library, Royal 12, D xvii). The original text reads as follows. ea /yoghbenttaile; se betsta l\u00e6cedom.\" This is translated into modern English as follows. \"Make an eyesalve against a wen: take equal amounts of cropleac [an Alliumspecies] and garlic, pound well together, take equal amounts of wine andoxgall, mix with the alliums, put this in a brass vessel, let [the mixture] standfor nine nights in the brass vessel, wring through a cloth and clarify well, put ina horn and at night apply to the eye with a feather; the best medicine.\" \u00a9 TheBritish Library Board, Royal 12 D Xll xvii. Reproduced with permission.Harrison et al. 2 \u00aembio.asm.org July/August 2015 Volume 6 Issue P/H110210.001, and t21/H110056.25, P/H11021 0.001, respectively); this was comparable to the results for batches A and B (Fig. 3). When onion/leek was dropped from the commonrecipe base, partial bactericidal activity was still observed ( t 21/H11005 3.38, P/H110050.015). Bactericidal activity was also retained when brass or oxgall was dropped from either ES-O Dropping either garlic or wine from ES-O or ES-L completely removed the bacte- ricidal activity: the viable cell counts were not signicantly differ-ent from the results for the control ( P/H113500.166). We then com- pared the results for the modied recipes that retained bactericidalactivity with the results for their parent recipes. The bactericidalpower of the common recipe base when onion/leek was omittedwas signicantly impaired compared with that ES-L ( t10/H110050.710, P/H110050.885). The combination of garlic, wine, and the other Allium species thus appears crucial for the full efcacy of Bald's eyesalve, andwhen onion is used in place of leek, oxgall is also necessary for fullactivity. Brass may be dispensable, but it is possible that its pres-ence may facilitate activity against other bacterial species; addi-tionally, using a brass pot may have allowed the Anglo-Saxon phy-sician to start work with an uncontaminated vessel, as the coppercontent could prevent bacteria colonizing its surface. Batch D of Bald's eyesalve was used to test whether the 9-day waiting period was important. ES-O and ES-L, with a water con-trol, were tested in the synthetic wound biolm model (i) imme-diately after preparation and (ii) after 9 days (Fig. 4). Analysis ofvariance (ANOVA) revealed signicant effects F2,24/H1100544.3, P/H110210.001). Post hoc Tukey tests showed that while both fresh and 9-day-old ES-O and ES-L killed cells (comparisons versus the respectivecontrols, P/H113490.037), the number of viable cells left after treatment with either version of the eyesalve was lower when the eyesalve hadbeen left to stand for 9 days prior to use (both P/H110210.001). ES-O FIG 2 Bald's eyesalve kills S. aureus in planktonic culture and in a synthetic wound biolm model. (A) One hundred microliters of sterile distilled water (black line), the onion variant of the eyesalve (ES-O, red line), or the leek variant of the eyesalve (ES-L, blue line) (both from batch A) was added to a 200- /H9262l mid-log-phase culture (104to 105cells) of S. aureus in synthetic wound fluid (SWF), and the optical density of the culture was measured during 18 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. The mean results from four replica populations and the associated standard errors (shaded intervals; too small to see for ES-O and ES-L) are sh own. (B) Two hundred microliters of ES-O or ES-L (batch A, lled circles, and batch B, open circles) or of each individual ingredient preparation was added to v e 1-day-old cultures of S. aureus growing at 37\u00b0C in a synthetic wound (400- /H9262l synthetic wound fluid rendered semisolid by adding 2 mg\u00b7ml/H110021collagen). After 24 h of further incubation, the collagen was dissolved to recover cells for agar plate counts. The control treatment was sterile distilled water left to st and for 9 days in the presence of brass, which was also present in all other preparations, to simulate the presence of a copper alloy vessel (see Materials and Methods). Asterisks denote treatments whose results were signicantly different from those of the control. FIG 3 The activity of Bald's eyesalve against S. aureus biolms requires several ingredients. Two hundred microliters of the onion variant of the eye- salve (ES-O), the leek variant of the eyesalve (ES-L) (batch C), or preparationsmissing a single ingredient were added to three 1-day-old cultures of S. aureus in synthetic wounds, and bactericidal activity quantied as described in Fig. 2.Red bars show the results for the full or reduced versions of ES-O, blue barsshow the results for the full or reduced versions of ES-L, and the green barshows the result for a variant of the eyesalve with neither onion nor leek (ES).The control treatment (grey bar) was sterile distilled water. Individual ingre-dients dropped out of the recipe (Minus) are coded as follows: O, onion; L,leek; X, oxgall; W, wine; G, garlic; B, brass. Reduced recipes were assessed ashaving full (F), partial (P), or no (N) activity in comparison with the results forthe control treatment and the appropriate complete recipe.A 1,000-Year-Old Antistaphylococcal Remedy July/August 2015 Volume \u00aembio.asm.org 3and ES-L caused a 2-log drop in viable S. aureus cells if used im- mediately after preparation but a 4- to 5-log drop if used after9 days (Fig. 4; consistent with data in Fig. 2B and 3). Bald's eyesalve kills MRSA in chronically infected animal tis- sue. All the ingredients in Bald's eyesalve are edible, and the like- lihood of copper accumulating to levels toxic to mammalian cellsseems low. Therefore, we tested its efcacy against S. aureus in a mouse model of chronic wound infection (22) using a thoroughlymodern pathogen: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (12). Mice were administered wounds as previously described (22) andinfected with MRSA. Four days postinfection, wounds were ex-cised and submerged in ES-O, ES-L (Batch B), sterile saline, or theclinical last-line antibiotic vancomycin (100 /H9262g\u00b7ml/H110021)f o r4h .A s shown by the results in Fig. 5, vancomycin did not cause signi- cant reductions in viable bacteria during this relatively very shortexposure time (comparison of least-squares means adjusted forthe experimental block) ( t 16/H110051.45, P/H110050.491). However, ES-O and ES-L caused statistically signicant drops in the numbers of viable cells recovered from wounds (approximately 10-fold re-ductions) ( t 16/H110053.94, P/H110050.006, and t16/H110053.66, P/H110050.010, re Batches A and B of ES-O and ES-L were also tested inthe mouse wound model after 3 months of storage at 4\u00b0C, butwithout the vancomycin comparison (see Fig. S2 in the supple-mental material): in this experiment, ES-L but not ES-O caused astatistically signicant drop in the numbers of viable cells recov-ered from wounds (an approximately 10-fold reduction). Thus,while there is some interbatch variability in activity, Bald's potential as an antistaphylococcal agent in vivo . DISCUSSION In summary, we have reconstituted a 1,000-year-old remedy for bacterial infection and shown that it kills the most common causeof the infection it was designed to treat. Bald's eyesalve eliminatesS. aureus in planktonic culture and reduces viable cell numbers by several orders of magnitude in a synthetic model of establishedbiolm infection. This effect depends upon the combination ofseveral ingredients and upon the 9-day storage period specied inthe recipe. Furthermore, a highly antibiotic-resistant strain ofS. aureus is susceptible to Bald's eyesalve when infected tissue from a mouse chronic wound model is exposed to the recipe. In thismodel, signicant bactericidal activity was observed after a briefperiod of exposure during which the current last-line clinical an-tibiotic (vancomycin) did not kill signicant numbers of bacteria.Our ndings contrast with those of a previous attempt to testBald's eyesalve by Brennessel et al. (23), who found it ineffectiveagainst S. aureus in disk diffusion assays; however, these authors do not specify the methods of preparation and do not give quan-titative results or details of replication, so we do not know exactlyhow their tests were conducted. Future work will explore the mechanism(s) by which Bald's eyesalve kills S. aureus . We note that several of the ingredients may damage biological membranes. Bile salts act as is thoughtto lipid-binding activity (19), and saponins, present in a widevariety of Allium spp., can bind the sterols present in biological membranes (3). Other antimicrobial compounds present in Al- lium spp. have been shown to act as enzyme inhibitors (allicin and flavonoids) (3). Wine may be a source of further plant-derivedantimicrobial small molecules, or it may simply act as a solvent forthe extraction of compounds from the other ingredients in therecipe, with the 9-day waiting period providing time for moleculeextraction. It is interesting that copper was entirely dispensable for anti- staphylococcal activity in our synthetic wound model. Copper hasbeen shown to have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (16, FIG 4 The activity of Bald's eyesalve against S. aureus biolms requires the 9-day waiting period specied by the recipe. Immediately after preparation, 200/H9262l of the onion variant of the eyesalve (ES-O), the leek variant of the eyesalve (ES-L) (batch D), or sterile distilled water was added to ve 1-day- old cultures of S. aureus growing at 37\u00b0C in synthetic wounds, and the bactericidal activity quantied as previously described (lled bars); theexperiment was repeated using ES-O and ES-L (batch D) after the 9-daywaiting period specied by Bald (open bars). Asterisks denote treatmentswhose results were signicantly different from those of the control. Whilethe control cultures for the 9-day experiment grew to slightly lower densi-ties than the control for the fresh eyesalve ( P/H110050.005), this difference was small compared with the differences observed for ES-O and ES-L (1 to 2 logversus 4 to 5 log difference). FIG 5 Bactericidal activity of Bald's eyesalve in a mouse chronic wound model of MRSA infection. Six adult female Swiss-Webster mice were admin- istered wounds and infected with ca. 105CFU S. aureus Mu50. Four days postinfection, mice were euthanized. Wound tissue was excised and cut into either three ( n/H110053 mice) or four ( n/H110053 mice) equal pieces, which were weighed, submerged in 300 /H9262l sterile saline (one replicate from n/H110056 mice), 100/H9262g\u00b7ml/H110021vancomycin (one replicate from n/H110053 mice), the onion variant of the eyesalve (ES-O; one replicate from n/H110056 mice), or the leek variant of the eyesalve (ES-L; one replicate from n/H110056 mice) (both ES-O and ES-L were from batch B) for 4 h, and then rinsed in sterile saline and homogenized. Viablebacteria were enumerated, and the counts standardized per gram of tissue.Asterisks denote treatments whose results were signicantly different fromthose of the control.Harrison et al. 4 \u00aembio.asm.org July/August 2015 Volume 6 Issue 4 e01129-1517), and we would expect copper salts to accumulate in our prep- arations: we observed copper compounds forming on the surfaceof the brass squares used to simulate the preparation vessel, andBrennessel et al. (who used an actual brass pot), found that coppersalts accumulated to high levels in their version of Bald's eyesalve(M. Drout, personal communication). It is possible that we simplydid not have a large enough copper surface to allow copper toaccumulate to biologically active levels in our recipe. Alterna-tively, the copper vessel itself may have allowed the Anglo-Saxonphysician to begin work with an uncontaminated pot due to theresistance of copper surfaces to bacterial colonization. A thirdpossibility is that copper is entirely dispensable: copper alloybowls of the Anglo-Saxon period can be highly decorated (eveninlaid with silver) and appear as grave goods in high status burialsas a marker of feasting power (24), and perhaps the more humblevessels may have been a marker of the physician's professionalstatus. The combined activity of molecules derived from the different ingredients might explain why the activity of Bald's eyesalve isgreater than the sum of its parts: the mixture may attack the bac-teria on several fronts. This is an important consideration for fu-ture work on natural antimicrobial compounds, as strong in vitro activity of individual compounds has not always translated intopositive in vivo results (6). Alternatively, novel compounds may be formed as molecules from different ingredients react over the9-day storage period specied by the recipe. Future research intoantibiotics derived from natural materials would benet fromconsidering potential combinatorial activity of different ingredi-ents, and premodern medical texts provide an excellent startingpoint for this strategy. Such work will require extensive collabor-ative research involving historians, linguists, microbiologists, andanalytical/medicinal chemists. When we describe Bald's eyesalve as being \"designed\" to treat eye infection, we do not use the term lightly. There has been con-siderable debate about the levels of scholarship and scienticmethod among early medieval medical practitioners (8, 9, 25).This may be partly because of an almost complete absence of the-oretical material, and the fact that the surviving corpus of Anglo-Saxon medicine seems to be compilations of excerpts and treatises(26). Furthermore, many recipes\u2014such as the one that requireshaving a virgin get water from an eastward-flowing spring for acyst \"which pains the heart,\" from the mid-11th century Lac- nunga\u2014 look rather dubious as remedies. Medicine, as some scholars have claimed, was a craft and not a science in early medi-eval Europe (26), and there was a lack of explanatory frameworks.Texts like Bald's Leechbook were most likely composed in a mo- nastic environment, and in many text sources, there is a conflationof spiritual and practical healing. More credence has been given tolater medieval texts, associated with the School of Salerno and thegrowth of university-based training (27). However, our nding that the combination of ingredients used is crucial for bactericidal activity supports the hypothesis that this\"ancientbiotic\" was systematically constructed based on empiricalknowledge. The fact that Anglo-Saxon recipes do not state de-tailed amounts of each component requires the practitioners tohave had some knowledge about how much of each ingredient touse. It is also notable that numerous \"alternative\" recipes are oftengiven for a condition\u2014indicating that a trained physician couldadapt treatments when necessary. If medieval physicians really diduse observation and experience to design effective antimicrobialmedicines, then this predates the generally accepted date for the adoption of a rational scientic method (the formation of theRoyal Society in the mid-17th century) and the modern age ofantibacterial medicine (Lister's use of carbolic acid in the late 19thcentury) by several hundred years. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and culture conditions. We used a standard laboratory wild-type strain of S. aureus (Newman) for the initial in vitro tests of antibacterial activity. For the mouse chronic wound model, we used S. au- reus Mu50 (ATCC 700699). Synthetic wound fluid (50% [wt/vol] fetal bovine serum, 50% peptone water) (20) was used as the growth mediumfor all experiments. All cultures were grown aerobically at 37\u00b0C. Bald's eyesalve. The recipe (Fig. 1) calls for equal amounts (\" begea emfela \") of the Allium species and equal amounts of wine and oxgall, but it is not clear whether these two pairs of quantities are equal to each other,nor whether ingredients were measured by weight or volume. We decidedto combine equal amounts by volume of all of the recipe ingredients. Forthe complete eyesalve recipes, 25 ml peeled, nely chopped garlic bulb wasmixed with either 25 ml peeled, nely chopped yellow onion or 25 mlnely chopped leek (leaves), and these ingredients were crushed with amortar and pestle for 2 min (the recipe asks for it to be pounded well:\"gecnuwe wel tosomne \"). Vegetables were purchased fresh from a green- grocer. Twenty-ve milliliters of wine (Pennard Organic Wines) wasadded to the crushed alliums; we used an organic English white wineproduced by a vineyard situated 7 miles from the village of Panborough inSomerset: a charter of AD956 tells us that the Anglo-Saxon monastery of St. Mary's Abbey in Glastonbury held land rights to a vineyard at Panbor-ough (28). We then added 25 ml bovine bile salts (Fluka/Sigma Aldrich)dissolved in water at a concentration of 87 mg\u00b7ml /H110021; this is the natural concentration of bile salts in the bovine gallbladder (source, Sigma Al- drich technical support). The mixture of alliums, wine, and oxgall wasplaced in a sterile 250-ml Duran bottle and, following the reasoning ofBrennessel et al. (23), nine clean and sterile 15-mm squares of 0.51-mm260 brass sheet (Hypertriton, Inc., Canada) were added to the bottle tosimulate the copper alloy vessel (\" arf\u00e6t \"). The lid was closed and the bottle wrapped in foil (as the original vessel would not have been trans-parent and we did not know if any ingredients were light sensitive). Therecipes, denoted ES-O for the version containing onion and ES-L for theversion containing leek, were then left refrigerated at 4\u00b0C for 9 days. Whilethe Anglo-Saxons did not have refrigerators, neither did they have cen-trally heated buildings: we reasoned that the daily fluctuations in ambienttemperature in the laboratory caused by heating during working hourswere probably less realistic than a constant cool temperature. To test the antibacterial effects of the individual ingredients of the recipe, when we made batches A and B, we also combined 6 ml of eachingredient (the vegetables were nely chopped and crushed as describedabove) with 17 ml of distilled water in a foil-wrapped glass bottle contain-ing two 15-mm squares of the brass sheet and left at 4\u00b0C for 9 days. This isan approximate scaling down of the recipe given the constraints imposedby measuring chopped vegetables accurately and by requiring a wholenumber of brass squares. To provide a control treatment, 23 ml distilledwater and two 15-mm squares of the brass sheet were left at 4\u00b0C for 9 days. We repeated the preparation of full recipes and individual ingredients twice, using fresh ingredients each time, to produce two independentbatches of the eyesalve or individual ingredient preparations (batches Aand B). We later repeated the preparation a third time (batch C), makingcomplete ES-O and ES-L recipes plus versions of the recipes that were eachmissing one ingredient, using the scaled-down, 24-ml total volume thatwas used for the individual ingredient preparations for batches A and B. The recipe calls for the mixture to be strained and \"puried well\" (\"hlyttre wel \") before use or further storage. We debated how to simulate this and whether we should sterilize the mixtures. We decided that anymicrobes present in the ingredients are part of the \"natural\" state of themedicine and would not have been removed by ltering through clothA 1,000-Year-Old Antistaphylococcal Remedy July/August 2015 Volume 6 4 \u00aembio.asm.org 5(probably linen). Therefore, we briefly centrifuged each recipe/ingredient to pellet the solid material and ltered the remaining liquid through alter small enough to remove solid particles of vegetable matter but largeenough to let bacterial cells through (5 /H9262m). Because the oxgall does not fully dissolve in the mixture, the nished eyesalve contains a ne white precipitate (especially noticeable when taken directly from cold storage).All versions of the eyesalve or its ingredients were thus briefly vortexedbefore use to ensure a homogenous suspension. Batch D of the complete recipes was made as described above but in two subbatches from the same ingredients. One subbatch was made with-out brass, shaken for 10 s, and then ltered and used in experimentsimmediately. Brass was added to the other subbatch, and this was storedfor 9 days at 4\u00b0C, following the original recipe. Growth and testing of planktonic cultures in synthetic wound fluid. Cultures of S. aureus were grown fo r 6 h (mid-log phase) in SWF at 37\u00b0C on an orbital shaker, and 200- /H9262l aliquots of this culture (containing 104to 105cells) were transferred to 12 wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. One hundred microliters of sterile distilled water, ES-O, or ES-L (Batch A only) was added to four wells each. Cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a micro-plate spectrophotometer (Tecan Innite) for 18 h with periodic shaking;every 15 min, the cultures were shaken for a few seconds and the opticaldensity at 600 nm (OD 600) of each well was measured. Because the eye - salve recipes were colored, we standardized the OD readings by subtract-ing the OD for each well at time zero. Culturing and treatment of synthetic wound infections. S. aureus was streaked onto LB agar and incubated aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 24 h.Multiple starter cultures in SWF. Thesewere incubated aerobically at 37\u00b0C on an orbital shaker for 6 h. The cul-tures were then diluted to an OD 600of 0.05 in SWF, and 100- /H9262l amounts added to wells of 24-well cell culture plates containing synthetic wound medium. Synthetic wounds comprised 400 /H9262l polymerized collagen (2 mg\u00b7ml/H110021collagen, 0.01% acetic 0.01 M so - dium hydroxide). For experiments on batches A and B of the eyesalve,additional synthetic wounds were mock inoculated with 100 /H9262l sterile distilled water instead of with S. aureus to reveal any growth of bacteria resident in the eyesalve or its component ingredients. Synthetic woundswere incubated aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 24 h to allow the establishment ofbacterial biolms within the collagen matrix. Batches A and B of the full recipes and individual ingredient prepara- tions were tested as follows. For S. aureus -infected wounds and the no- infection control, ve replica synthetic wounds were overlaid with 200 /H9262l of each complete recipe or individual ingredients. A further ve infectedand noninfected synthetic wounds were overlaid with 200 /H9262l sterile dis- tilled water to provide controls. Treated synthetic woundswere then incubated aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. The collagen was thendepolymerized by treating each wound with 500 /H9262l 0.5 mg\u00b7ml/H110021collage - nase. An aliquot of each wound was serially diluted and plated on LB agarto enumerate the number of viable cells present. For batch C (full recipes and recipes missing a single ingredient), this experiment was repeated but each preparation was tested in triplicate. Forbatch D (full recipes before and after 9-day storage), each preparation wastested in ve replica wounds. For batches C and D, only a single no-infection control wound was used for each experiment; this was visuallyinspected to conrm the absence of contaminating bacterial growth andnot analyzed further. Mouse chronic wound infections. Adult female Swiss-Webster mice were administered wounds as previously described (22) and infected withapproximately 10 5CFU S. aureus Mu50. At 4 days postinfection, mice were euthanized and their wound tissue was extracted and cut into 3 equal pieces, which were weighed. Wound sections were then submerged in300 /H9262l sterile saline, ES-O, or ES-L for 4 h, after which they were rinsed in sterile saline and homogenized. Wound homogenates were then seriallydiluted and to determine CFU/g tissue. This experimentwas carried out twice on separate days, and data from the two blockscombined in one analysis. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Labora-tory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was ap-proved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of TexasTech University Health Sciences Center (protocol number 07044), and anNC3Rs ARRIVE checklist (29; see also www.nc3rs.org.uk) is available forthis work. Statistical analyses. All data were analyzed with R (version 2.14.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, http://www.R-project.org ). Differ- ent models and their residuals were explored to nd the most appropriateanalysis for each data set. The data sets for S. aureus growth in synthetic wounds treated with batches A to C of the recipes/ingredients were highlyskewed; therefore, these data sets were analyzed using generalized linearmodels with Poisson error. ANOVAs of log-transformed data were usedto analyze (i) the 30-day retest of batches A and B in synthetic woundinfections and (ii) the test for an effect of the 9-day waiting period usingbatch D. In all analyses where both batches A and B were used, we testedfor effects of treatment, batch, and their interaction. Post hoc compari-sons were conducted using the multcomp package (30). For the S. aureus synthetic wound data for batch C, one replica wound treated with eyesalveminus onion/leek had to be dropped from the data set, as it completelydried out during incubation. Data on MRSA viable cell counts in mousechronic wounds were not suitable for analysis using general linear modelsand so were analyzed by tting least-squares means for each treatmentadjusted for the effect of the experimental block; Tukey tests were thenused to test pairwise differences between treatments, with Pvalues ad- justed for multiple comparisons. The growth curves of the S. aureus re- porter strains were compared using the compare GrowthCurves functionof the statmod package (version 1.4.21; http://CRAN.R-project.org/ package /H11005statmod For each strain, growth curves from different treat- ments were compared using 1,000 permutations of the data and theHolm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
