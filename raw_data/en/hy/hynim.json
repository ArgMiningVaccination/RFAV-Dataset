Proceedings: Exercise and Physical Activity in Aging ABSTRACT Falls are the leading cause of emergency department visits,hospital admissions, and unintentional death for older adults.Balance and strength impairments are common falls risk factors for community-dwelling older adults. Though physical therapists commonly treat balance and strength, standardizedfalls screening has not been fully incorporated into physicaltherapy practice and there is much variation in the frequency,intensity, and duration of therapy prescribed to achieve optimalresults. For community-dwelling older adults, a progressiveexercise program that focuses on moderate to high-intensitybalance exercises appears to be one of the most effectiveinterventions to prevent falls. For more frail older adults ininstitutional settings, exercise programs in addition to multi-factorial interventions appear to show promise as effective fallsprevention interventions. The minimum dose of exercise toprotect an older adult against falls is 50 hours. This articledescribes the current best practices for physical therapiststo effectively improve balance and manage falls risk in patients.The unique challenges and opportunities for physical thera-pists to incorporate evidence-based fall-prevention strate-gies are discussed. Innovative practice models incorporating evidence-based fall-prevention programs and partnerships with public health and aging service providers to create acontinuum of care and achieve the optimal dose of balancetraining are presented. ( J Geriatr Phys Ther 2011;34:100-108.) INTRODUCTION Falls are the public health epidemic of this decade. More than 30% of people aged 65 years and older and more than50% of people aged 80 years and older will fall this year. 1 Falls are the leading cause of traumatic brain injury andfractures in older adults. 1For individuals aged 65 and older, falls outpace motor vehicle accidents as the leading cause ofunintentional death by several thousands. 2Falls are the leading cause of emergency department visits by olderadults, and the number one cause of hospital admissions due to trauma.1It is estimated the average cost of a hospi- tal admission due to a fall is $20,000. By 2030, an esti-mated $54 billion will be spent on health care in direct andindirect medical costs due to falls. 3 Terminology Developing effective interventions to manage falls risk inolder adults has posed a significant challenge to researchersand clinicians, requiring complex solutions. To betterunderstand the arguments presented in this article, readersshould be familiar with the definitions of terms being usedin the fall risk reduction literature. A multifactorial intervention is any program or protocol that includes the assessment of and interventions for morethan one of the multiple risk factors that might contributeto likelihood of falling. A multifactorial intervention mayinvolve contributions from several health disciplines, suchas physicians, pharmacists, physical therapists, nurses, andsocial work professionals. 4 A single-factor intervention typically focuses on one of the risk factors associated with likelihood of falling. A single- factor intervention might include only balance training activ- ities, medication management, or home safety education. 5 A multicomponent exercise program is an exercise intervention that incorporates multiple components; it mayinclude activities targeting performance (strength, muscleendurance, power), balance and postural control, andwalking or cardiovascular endurance. 6,7 A single-component exercise program consists of only one modality of exercise: strength training or balanceactivities, or walking. 6,7 A balance training program is an intervention that is designed to progressively improve an individual's balanceskills. 8 Moderate challenge balance exercise programs include two of the three modes of balance exercises: (1) movementaround the individual's center of mass; (2) using a narrowbase of support; (3) with minimal upper extremity support.A high challenge balance program would include all three modes of balance exercises. 9 A structured exercise intervention or program is script- ed, and is composed of key components (warm-up, balance,gait training, etc) delivered in a consistent manner over aEvidence-Based Exercise Prescription for Balance and Falls Prevention: A CurrentReview of the Literature Tiffany E.

These programs are designed to be progressive and challenging as an individual masters differ-ent strength, balance, and coordination skills. Best practice programs are exercise programs, often offered at senior centers and wellness facilities, composedof evidence-based components. These programs in theirentirety have not been tested in randomized controlled tri-als. 10 Evidence-based programs are interventions that have been translated and tested in the community setting in randomized controlled trials and found to be effective in reducing risk of falling. These programs are highly scripted,target specific populations (ie, older adults with fear offalling, older adults with chronic disease) and include spe-cific implementation instructions. They are designed to bedelivered in a standardized way to insure similar outcomesare achieved regardless of instructor or setting. 10 The terms \"Best Practice\" and \"Evidence-Based\" come from the public health domain. These terms were developedto classify behavioral change programs. Because falls havebecome a public health concern, these terms are now beingused to describe effective fall prevention research interven-tions as they are translated for clinical practice and/or disseminated into the community setting. The most effective research interventions report reduc- tions of 35% to 40% in fall rates. It should be made clearthat the term falls prevention refers to the optimal manage- ment of falls risk to prevent the falls that can be prevented.It is estimated that the maximum reduction in fall rates dueto an intervention is between 30% and 40%. 5A certain number of older adults will still fall, regardless of interven-tions, but every effort must be taken to minimize risk. Purpose This integrative review article will present the most currentevidence on effective fall-prevention management for phys-ical therapists. RISK FACTORS AND SCREENING Poor balance and difficulty in walking are common impair-ments that contribute to older adults' high risk of falling. 11-13 The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) published clinicalguidelines in 2001, subsequently expanded and revised in2011, that recommended all adults aged 65 years and olderbe screened for falls. 14If an older adult reports a fall in the previous year, a more in-depth evaluation is warranted, andappropriate interventions implemented to minimize risk offuture falls. 2The extent to which physical therapists and other health professionals have adopted the AGS recom-mendation is not known. A study of 2002 MedicareBeneficiary data 15reported 22% of Medicare beneficiaries fell at least once each year (6.86 million people), and 10%or more falling multiple times (ie, those with history ofrecurrent falls, 3.1 million people). Less than half of thosewho fell actually discussed their fall with a health careprovider. 15The AGS clinical guidelines were created to identify those with history of recurrent falls deemed at high-er risk of injury and hospitalization.2,11,13,14The results from this study suggest health care providers had limitedadoption of the guidelines. By not identifying high-risk indi-viduals, an opportunity to implement appropriate interven-tions to mitigate the risk of future falls was missed, ulti-mately negatively impacting patient outcomes. Multiple factors contribute to an older adult's risk of falling. A systematic review of 33 studies identified 17 inde-pendent contributing factors to falls risk in community-dwelling older adults. 11To complicate matters further, it appears there is a significant interaction between risk fac-tors and an individual's level of function. 7,16,17For example, the risk factors of urinary incontinence, cognitive impair-ment, and fear of falling may have a greater impact on fallsrisk for low-functioning individuals with multiple othercomorbidities 18-21than for high-functioning individuals liv- ing independently in the community.11,14,22Understanding the complex interaction between function and risk factors isthe basis for developing targeted interventions to achievedesired outcomes. Effective fall-prevention interventionsaccount for contributing risk factors, triage factors basedon impairments, and implement appropriate interventions. The visual impairment trial provides an excellent exam- ple of how a targeted intervention can result in effectiveoutcomes, specifically reducing the risk of falling. 23 Researchers assessed the efficacy of two fall-preventioninterventions (a home modification program and a home-based exercise program) for older adults with severe visualimpairment living independently in the community.Significantly less falls were experienced by those random-ized to the home safety group, and there was minimal to noreduction in number of falls in the exercise group. 23Even though previous studies had demonstrated the home exer-cise program to effectively reduce the rates of falls in olderadults without visual impairment, 8,24,25improving strength and balance as a first intervention in those who were visu-ally impaired was not effective. An appropriate sequence ofinterventions may have been referral to an ophthalmologistto perform a visual assessment, modification of the home toremove all hazards that the individual could not see, andthen implementation of a strengthening program. The AGS published a 2011 update of the guidelines. 26 The guidelines still specify all older adults be screened annu-ally for falls by a health care provider, but now haveexpanded to include screening for balance and mobilityimpairments. 26The screen consists of (1) asking the older person if they have experienced a fall over the past year (yesor no), (2) asking if they are experiencing difficulty withwalking or with their balance (yes or no), and/or (3) observ-ing whether performance of walking and balance is com-promised (yes or no) using the Timed Up and Go test orother balance assessment. 26If one or more of these screens are \"positive\" the individual should be referred for a com-prehensive multifactorial fall-risk assessment (Table 1). Ideally, physical therapists should screen all older adults seen in their practice setting for the risk of falling. If the screenis positive, this would trigger a comprehensive fall-risk assess-ment as a part of the physical therapy evaluation.

The AGS multifactorial assessment protocol provides valu- able insight on all risk factors associated with falls. Severalreliable and validated tools are available to assess balance andmobility across the continuum of function (Berg BalanceScale, 27Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment,28,29 Dynamic Gait Index,30Timed Up and Go,31,32etc). However, these tools do not take into account the medical risk factorsassociated with falling, which may in part explain the fair tomoderate ability of these tools to predict a fall. 26,29,32-34These tools are important when assessing balance and gait impair-ment, but each tool only provides information on specificaspects of falls risk. Once risk factors are assessed and theevaluation is completed, the physical therapist can createappropriate interventions for the patient. (For more informa-tion about the utility of balance and physical performancemeasures to assess falls risk, visit www.PTNow.org.) CURRENT STATE OF PRACTICE The AGS guidelines were published with the goal of stan-dardizing practice around fall-risk screening, assessment, andintervention. 26Across practice settings within the profession of physical therapy, there is much variation in fall-risk assess-ment, management, and intervention. A study investigatingfall-management strategies used by physical therapists inhome care practice found that although knowledgeableabout risk factors associated with falling, less than 50% ofrespondents linked interventions to risk factors or referredpatients to other providers. 35Another study investigating effectiveness of physical therapy referral as a component of amultifactorial intervention found 84% of participants (n /H11005136) were referred to physical therapy for gait and balance impairment, but one-third of those r eferred did not seek care because of transportation issues, cost incurred, or a belief that therapy would not be beneficial. 36Nearly 50% of those who attended physical therapy sessions received instructionin balance exercises only once during the entire episode ofcare, and only a few patients received a home exercise pro-gram to maintain or continue progress. 15,36 No published study to date has demonstrated that physical therapy as a single intervention is more effective than struc-tured exercise programs to prevent falls. This may be due tothe inherent variability in physical therapy practice, as well asthe apparent importance of the length of the duration of theintervention (minimum of 12 weeks for optimal outcomes). 9 A study of outpatient physical therapy care compared physical performance measures and balance confidencemeasures of older adults (mean age /H1100582.7, SD /H110055.6 years) participating in a structured balance exercise training pro-tocol that was integrated into a \"standard of care\" physicaltherapy intervention to older adults receiving individualizedphysical therapy care. Both interventions were deliveredtwice a week over a 6-week period. The researchers report-ed slightly better outcomes in the physical performancemeasures and significantly better outcomes improvementsin balance confidence measures for those in the exercisegroup compared with the physical therapy group. A similarstudy assessed outcomes for more frail older adults (meanage /H1100582.4, SD /H110054.8 years) admitted to the acute care or rehabilitation setting due to a fall. This study compared typical physical therapy (twice a week for 3 months) to the same care along with a progressive exercise program (threetimes a week for 3 months). The researchers reported thatindividuals in the exercise interventions demonstrated sig-nificant improvements in balance, strength, and functionalmotor performance. More importantly, the individualsreceiving usual PT care alone did not demonstrate any sig-nificant improvements in these measures. 37 It appears structured exercise interventions that are delivered either by a physical therapist4,6,24,25,38,39or by a trained individual supervised by a physical therapist40-42 may be one of the most effective interventions to preventfalls. The role of therapists in these interventions was tolead structured, progressive exercise programs over a peri-od of 3 to 12 months. Outcomes include improvements inphysical performance measures and significant reductionsin fall rates. 24,25,39,40 Creating a plan of care that lasts 3 months or more is not common within the current health care system. Yet, theinformation reported in a recent Cochrane review 6and a meta-analysis published by Sherrington9support longer interventions that are exercise-based are highly effective inmanaging falls in community-dwelling older adults. Thisinformation may dictate a paradigm shift in how physicaltherapists effectively manage falls risk. This shift mayrequire integrating structured and progressive exercise pro-tocols into an individual's plan of care, and innovative part-nerships with other providers to create longer durationinterventions for patients at risk of falling.1.

Conflicting evidence may account for the varia-tions seen in physical therapy practice. There are manyunanswered questions about the most effective interven-tions, especially in skilled nursing, assisted living, and hos-pital settings. Recent meta-analyses and Cochrane reviewssuggest for community-dwelling older adults, progressiveexercise regimes that focus on strength and balance areeffective interventions to address risk and rate offalling. 6,9,43The recommendations are different for older adults who are frail, or reside in residential care or skillednursing facilities. For these individuals, exercise alone isnot an effective intervention, and in some cases has resultedin an increase in fall rates. 7,44However, when exercise is incorporated into a multifactorial intervention delivered bya multidisciplinary team, the risk of falling is reduced. 7 This difference is probably due to the increase in medicalcomplexity and greater level of functional impairment ofthese particular patients. EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION FOR COMMUNITY- DWELLING OLDER ADULTS Even though the literature supports exercise as one of the most effective interventions for community-dwelling olderadults, all risk factors must be assessed and triaged appro-priately. The physical therapist must use clinical judgmentto determine which, if any, risk factors should be addressedfirst before starting a physical therapy intervention or bal-ance and strength training program. As an example, con-sider the older individual who presents with wearing bifo-cals, 45being depressed,13and exhibiting fear of falling,46in addition to poor balance and leg muscle weakness as riskfactors for falls. The physical therapist may recommend avisit to an ophthalmologist for proper eyewear or to thephysician to evaluate the depression before starting an exer-cise-based interventions. The therapist might address thefear of falling during physical therapy sessions, or refer theindividual to behavioral change programs in the communi-ty (eg, Matter of Balance 47). For these particular risk fac- tors, and others including cognitive impairment, polyphar-macy, exercise may not be the most appropriate, effective,or safe initial intervention to implement in falls risk man-agement program. Exercise Dose Sherrington's meta-analysis of 44 studies determined theminimum dose of exercise to effectively reduce the risk andrate of falls is 50 hours. 9The delivery of the dose of exer- cise was dependent on the trial, with trials achieving the 50hours over a period of 3 months, 246 months,40,48-50or longer.40Interventions that achieved the minimum dose over 6 months or less may be slightly more effective thanthose that extend over a 12-month period. 9,51Interventions that delivered a lower total dose of exercise (typically last-ing less than 12 weeks) did not consistently reduce the rateor risk of falling. 9,52-54In addition, it appears individuals who start an exercise program to improve balance, but donot achieve the minimum dose may actually be at a higherrisk of falling. 55It may be that the gains achieved in strength and balance are enough to improve mobility, butnot enough to achieve a protective effect if the individual'sresulting increased activity level exceeds his or her balanceability. Achieving 50 hours of balance exercise within current physical therapy practice settings and funding models isextremely challenging. Use of validated home exercise programs from one of the published randomized controlled trials may be a strategy to achieve the 50-hour dose duringa plan of care. 24,40,50The Otago Exercise Program,8for example, demonstrated a 40% reduction in falls over a 1-yearperiod for those in the intervention group. The programincludes a brief series of full body warm-up exercises, andthen 17 exercises that target leg strength (knee extension,knee flexion, hip abduction, standing squats, chair rises,toe/heel raises), balance (single leg stand, tandem stance),and walking performance (backwards walking, turning,heel walk/toe walk). 8The program can be completed in 30 to 45 minutes, and was originally designed for delivery inthe home setting. The exercises are appropriate for indi-viduals with high to moderate levels of functional limita-tions and impairment, but may not challenge individualswith low levels of impairment and higher levels of overallfunction. 8 Another strategy to achieve optimal dose is to partner with other providers (kinesiologists, physical therapy assis-tants) and community-based organizations (YMCAs, seniorcenters, parks, and recreation departments) to offer a bestpractice balance improvement program or an evidence-based fall-prevention program recognized by the Centersfor Disease Control in the \"Compendium of EffectiveCommunity-Based Interventions.\" 56Stepping On, Tai Chi Moving for Better Balance, and the Otago ExerciseProgram are 3 of the 14 studies recognized as effective inreducing fall risk in the CDC Compendium. These particu-lar programs have training manuals to guide implementa-tion with fidelity to the original program. These programshave been selected by the CDC for a dissemination pilotstudy in three states from 2011-2013. Mode of Exercise It does appear that the mode of exercise selected will have thegreatest impact on outcomes. The Sherrington meta-analysisreported moderate to high challenge balance training was theonly mode of exercise that had a significant protective effecton the rates of falls (estimated 25% reduction in fall rates).The other modes assessed, strength training, stretching, andwalking, as single interventions, did not have a significantprotective effect on the rates of falls. 9This finding is consis- tent with a previous meta-analysis of eight trials that report-ed individuals participating in exercise programs that includ-ed balance exercises had a pooled estimated 17% lower fallsrisk compared with interventions with other forms of exer-cise. 57On the basis of this information, balance training Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Section on Geriatrics of the American Physical Therapy Association.

Static activities Exercises that challenge the center of mass (eg, reachingwhile standing) while the feet remain fixed, and exercisesthat practice a narrow base of support (eg, tandemseries, single-leg stance) have been included in effectiveinterventions. 24,39,40,49-51,61-65The activities are typically progressed from a wide base of support in standing to anarrower base. For greater challenge, a sensory componentcan be included (standing on an unstable surface or stand-ing with the eyes closed) Repetition, progression, and con-tinually challenging the patient is key over the duration ofthe intervention. 24,39,40,49-51,61-65 Dynamic activities Activities that challenge the center of mass while the feet arein motion are dynamic activities. Dynamic activities tend tobe functional, and may include reaching, turning in a circle,standing, and stair-stepping. 66-68Many of the motions incor- porated into Tai Chi training are dynamic activities; incorpo-rating slow controlled motions of the upper extremities andtorso while stepping and weight shifting. Several researchstudies assessing Tai Chi as an intervention to improve bal-ance and prevent falls have reported favorable out-comes. 50,69,70However, it does appear that to be effective, the minimal dose must be achieved. Interventions that are lessthan 12 weeks typically are not as effective in improving bal-ance and preventing falls as those of 12 weeks or greater. 71-73 Though Tai Chi does appear to be an effective fall pre- vention intervention, the participant of many studies of TaiChi have been high-functioning community-dwelling olderadults, and the instructors have been trained Tai Chi mas-ters. Two studies assessing the impact of a Tai Chi inter-vention in a nursing home setting reported no significantdifferences in falls between those in the Tai Chi group andthe control group. 74-77For community-dwelling individu- als, the qualities of an effective Tai Chi instructor need to bedefined in the research. It is not known if only Tai Chi mas-ters can achieve optimal results, or if physical therapists orkinesiologists can be trained to deliver Tai chi movementsand achieve similar outcomes. Dynamic gait training Dynamic gait training can be incorporated into progressionof intervention using dance steps, circling, figure eights,directional changes on command, obstacle courses, and dual-task training. 8,39,40,62,65 Dual-task training Dual-task training involves doing a primary task (maintain-ing postural control or walking speed) while performing asecondary task (eg, a cognitive challenge such as countingbackwards, or a manual task such as carrying an item). 78 Dual-task training challenges the ability to allocate attentionto two things at once while maintaining performance. 78,79 Older adults who have difficulty performing walking andtalking tasks are at a higher risk of falling. 80,81Dual-task performance can be improved with training.82,83Dual tasks for balance training interventions may include having aconversation while walking with a focus on maintainingwalking speed, 84walking and counting,85or walking while performing a manual task such as carrying a full cup of liq-uid, multiple objects, or simulated laundry. 78It appears that when training dual-task, incorporating variable priorityinstructions (switching the attentional focus between trials,ie, trial one, focus on maintaining walking speed; trial two,focus on the counting task) can have a greater impact onoutcomes. 86In a randomized controlled trial on the effects of single-task versus dual-task training on balance perform-ance in older adults, Silsupadol et al found that changingthe focus of the dual-task priority instructions from a pri-ority on cognitive to a priority on the physical task resultedin greater improvements of performance. 86 Strength training Strength is a key element of fall prevention; however,strength training alone without a balance component isnot an effective strategy to prevent falls. 43A recent meta- analysis identified the key components of strength trainingthat translate to improved balance and reduced falls riskincluding: (1) A focus on lower-extremity and postural mus-cles; (2) Minimal upper-extremity support; (3) Deliveredat either a moderate or high intensity to achieve thedesired results. A few strength training interventions haveresulted in more injuries compared with balance traininginterventions. 6,43,87 Walking Evidence suggests that walking as an intervention for thoseat high risk of falls, or done without concurrent balancetraining may result in a higher risk of falling. 9,17,88Walking as an exercise should not be included in the beginning of afall-prevention program, when the focus needs to be onstrength and balance. However, walking is one of the safestand easiest forms of aerobic exercise across all populations,and may be an appropriate addition to a fall-preventionprogram in higher functioning individuals. 48The Otago Exercise Program provides an excellent example of howand when walking should be incorporated into a balanceprogram. Individuals begin with home-based strength andbalance exercises, and typically after 4 weeks were instructedto include three 30-minute walking sessions per week intotheir exercise routine. 24JPT200120_JGPT 8/17/11 5:57 PM Page 104Journal of GERIATRIC Physical Therapy 105 ExPAAC Proceedings Perturbation and compensatory stepping training Maintaining one's balance requires control during volitional movement and also the ability to recover from a loss of balance. Incorporating perturbation training may be an effective way to improve reaction times 58,89,90and improve stepping strategies.59,60This type of training requires spe- cialized equipment, and must be administered in a one-to-one session by a physical therapist. Individuals who com-pleted a 30-minute perturbation-based balance trainingprogram three times a week for 6 weeks took fewer multi-step reactions and had fewer foot collisions when the baseof support was changed (the force plate moved to mimic aslip or change in surface) compared to controls in a flexi-bility and relaxation group. 60However, when the center of mass was changed (individuals were hooked up to a cable,and the cable was manipulated to alter their center of massas in a trip) there were no significant differences in per-formance between the two groups. Those in the interven-tion group also demonstrated a decreased need for upperbody support during a perturbation. 60Perturbation may be a feasible intervention in a clinical setting, and it may resultin improved reaction times and greater efficiency in recov-ering balance. However, little evidence exists to supportperturbation training translates to fewer falls. To date, onlyone study that this author is aware of has demonstratedthat improved reaction times and stepping strategies did sig-nificantly reduce falls rates in frail older adults. 58 Frequency and duration of exercise There is no consensus in the clinical research literature onoptimal frequency and duration for effective exercise inter-ventions. Reported frequencies range from once to threetimes weekly, and duration range from 12 weeks to oneyear. 6,9The one consistent finding across studies is that the interventions have established and followed a standardizedroutine (same components each time, ie, warm-up, balance,strength, etc) with a systematic progression of the difficultyof the exercises, so the individual is challenged over theintervention period. EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION FOR FRAIL OR INSTITUTIONALIZED OLDER ADULTS Exercise to improve balance must be part of a multifactor- ial intervention assessing all risk factors in frail older adults.Individuals in skilled nursing facilities have the same riskfactors as community dwellers; however, the risk factors ofincontinence, stroke, dementia, depression, and use ofsedating medications 18-21,91are far more prevalent. Fall- prevention interventions that were either solely exercise-based or physical therapy-based either had no significantprotective effects 17,92or actually resulted in an increase in falls.44The greater number of comorbidities and the com- plexity involved in patient care provides insight as to whyan exercise-only intervention may not be effective. When exercise is included as part of a multifactorial intervention, the guidelines are similar to those for community-dwelling older adults: the intervention shouldfocus primarily on balance and balance challenge exercises, the exercises should be done while standing, and should beprogressed over a period of time. 7Exercise interventions to improve balance and strength have been demonstrated asfeasible and safe in both frail older adults and those withsignificant cognitive impairment. 93-98 Exercise Dose The minimum dose of exercise for frail or institutionalizedolder adults has yet to be determined. It does appear thatexercise interventions may have a greater impact on out-comes for this population over a shorter period of time, butthis may be due to the greater number of impairments atbaseline compared to community dwellers. Interventionsthat have demonstrated significant improvements in func-tional measures have been a minimum of 8 weeks and amaximum of 1 year in duration. 67,99,100Shorter interven- tions (8 weeks or less) with fewer frequencies (twice a weekor less) do not consistently demonstrate significant changesin outcome measures. 54,101,102 Mode of Exercise Effective exercise interventions to improve balance andstrength are those that incorporate functional balance train-ing, high intensity strength training, and gait training. 67,103 Even supervised power training has proven to be safe andeffective in this population. 104-106Perturbation training in conjunction with gait and balance training appears to be aneffective way to decrease the rate of falls, but may not havea significant impact on risk factors. 58,107,108 Frequency and Duration of Exercise Optimal frequency and duration is not known at this time.Common themes include consistency (attending a class acertain number of times per week), a structured progression,and a program tailored to the needs of the individual andprogressed appropriately. 101,102For example, an individual with significant functional impairment may benefit morefrom a functional exercise program with a slow progression;whereas an individual with significant cognitive impairmentwill benefit from a structured exercise program in which thesame exercises are done the same way each time. CONCLUSION The research supports the most effective interventions tomanage falls risk are those that incorporate exercise. Foroptimal results, the exercise program needs to be structured,progressed, and must achieve the minimum dose of exercise.The information presented in this article has several impli-cations to clinical practice: Exercise interventions should be structured. We must strive for greater consistency between treatment sessions, orensure the patient is doing a regimented home exercise pro-gram faithfully. The home exercise program should be struc-tured, progressive and incorporate center of m ass, narrow base of support, and minimal upper extremity assistance.Exercises should become more challenging (two-hand Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Section on Geriatrics of the American Physical Therapy Association.

Fall-prevention interventions should be individually tai- lored to challenge the patient on the basis of level of his orher impairments . Therapists need to coordinate with other health care professionals to insure all risk factors areaddressed. Exercises should be prescribed that challengebalance based on risk factors and impairment level. Intervention must achieve the optimal dose . One of the greatest challenges of fall prevention is the duration ofintervention necessary to achieve optimal outcomes. Theexercises can be delivered in the clinic, home, or in groupexercise classes; the most important thing is that the exer-cises are actually done by the patient. Researchers havereported that effective programs have been delivered eitherby a physical therapist, or an individual trained and super-vised by a physical therapist. Effective fall management requires a paradigm shift in how physical therapists provide care (Figure 1). Consideran older adult referred to physical therapy with a medicaldiagnosis of adhesive capsulitis. During the initial evalua-tion, the therapist administers a falls screen, and discoversthe capsulitis is due to a shoulder injury incurred when thepatient fell at home. The therapist performs the Timed Upand Go test, and the patient has difficulty rising from achair and performs the task in 15 seconds. In addition toassessing the shoulder joint, the therapist will ideally insti-tute a comprehensive fall-risk assessment. When the med-ication screen identifies the patient is taking eight medica-tions, three of which can affect reaction time and increaserisk of falls, the therapists contacts the physician with arequest for a new diagnosis of balance impairment, andclearance for participation in physical therapy based on amedication review. The shoulder injury and falls riskbecome the focus of the episode of care, and clinical goalsare expanded to include falls prevention. There will be afinite goal of improving the shoulder function and a longer-term goal of fall-risk management. The therapist willimprove the individual's balance and functional mobility tothe point of safe participation in an evidence-based pro-gram, where these improvements can be further progressedand sustained. The patient will ultimately be discharged toa maintenance program when the dose of balance traininghas been achieved. This change in paradigm dictates that physical therapy shifts from episodic care\u2014treat the diagnosis, progress to a functional level, discharge to an independent self-directedprogram\u2014to a continuum of care\u2014patients progressed to meet their functional goals, transitioned to an in-house orcommunity bridge program, discharge to a fitness or ahome exercise program. While the individual is in transi-tion, he or she remains in contact with the therapist to con-tinue progress. The therapist may not formally dischargethe patient until independence is achieved with the appro-priate exercise program. By extending beyond the tradi-tional therapy model, the optimal dose of exercise isachieved. There is a greater potential for patients to main-tain progress, continue to improve upon their abilities, sus- tain meaningful and permanent changes in risk factors, andultimately reduce falls risk. Instituting effective fall-prevention interventions provides opportunities to create partnerships and collaborationswith health care professionals and community providers.For example, the Centers for Disease Control and theNational Council on Aging have recognized falls as animportant issue that must be addressed. Both of these organizations have iden tified evidence-based fall-preven- tion programs (Otago Exercise Program, Stepping On, and Tai Chi Moving for Better Balance) that will be piloted inthree states in 2012. The programs will be offered throughsenior and community centers (Stepping On, Tai Chi) andalso in the home (Otago Exercise Program). Some programswill be delivered by physical therapists, and some by trainedfitness professionals and community providers. If proven Figure 1 .

These types of multidisciplinarypartnerships are innovative models to effectively and effi-ciently create a continuum of care with the potential of hav-ing a significant impact on falls in older adult patients.
