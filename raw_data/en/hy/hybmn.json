Annual pap smears are important to check for HPV and to monitor the health of your cervix. With about [70% of the population](http://www.livescience.com/45737-hpv-infection-prevalence.html) carrying HPV (human papilloma virus), the chances are good that many of us will have to deal with an abnormal pap smear at some point. Getting an abnormal pap smear can feel very scary. Words like pre-cancer create a lot of anxiety and the proposed treatment - a LEEP procedure - can be uncomfortable and painful. We all know someone or have ourselves been through the worrisome wait for test results. But the more educated you are about your body, the more prepared you will feel. The reality is that the vast majority of abnormal pap smears show low grade cervical dysplasia or cervical abnormalities that do not lead directly to pre-cancer cells or a cancer diagnosis. Getting yourself checked-up and tested is important, but for most women, an abnormal result should not be cause for alarm. The majority of cervix health issues are very treatable and you can feel confident that the next time you have a check-up, everything will be fine. When it comes to HPV, even though here is no secret cure in most cases by boosting your immune system and taking the proper steps, you can have a clear pap smear in a matter of weeks. Yes, you can actually reverse your HPV diagnosis, treat it, and get rid of it. This means, once diagnosed, you can work to support your body, boost your immunity, and then, when you return to your OBGyn, the HPV will be gone. There are, of course, certain cases in which HPV and/or an abnormal pap smear can be more serious, so please work with your health care practitioner to assess your situation, and don't be afraid to get second opinions. Getting regular pap smears is still the best way to maintain your cervical health. There is a difference between low grade cervical dysplasia and high grade cervical dysplasia. The following suggestions relate to low grade cervical dysplasia symptoms only. However, we want you to know that your body is remarkably resilient, and there are natural approaches to healing your cervix: It's important that every woman know this is possible and that you can take a proactive position on your own health and well-being. Knowledge is power, the more you have at your fingertips the better! Plus, how can you know what is best for you and your body without all the information? The following natural remedies have been shown to help clear up HPV when the issue is caught early and cervical cell changes are minimal. HPV is very common and often very treatable with these natural remedies. Other common women's health issues - like UTIs, yeast infections, and bacterial vaginosis - are also [avoidable and treatable with natural remedies](https://www.floliving.com/bacterial-vaginosis-yeast-infections-and-utis-my-must-have-natural-treatments/).
