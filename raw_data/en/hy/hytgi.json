Under some laws, no exemption is needed. \u00bbEXAMPLES Arizona House Bill 2498 prohibits a government entity from requiring a resident of the state to receive a vaccination for COVID -19. Others include Alaska, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming. \u00bbPROBLEMATIC BECAUSE Vaccines are among the most effective public health interventions. Vaccine requirements impose a relatively modest restriction on individual liberties. Prohibiting COVID vaccine requirements, despite longstanding use of vaccine requirements in U.S. law, undermines governmental authority to require other vaccines. Masks \u00bbWHAT THESE TYPES OF LAWS DO Block public health and executive branch officials from requiring the use of face masks in public places such as schools, businesses, workplaces, and places of worship, or limiting the time during which such requirements may be in place. \u00bbEXAMPLES Tennessee Senate Bill 9014 prohibits most governmental entities from requiring persons (including employees) to wear face coverings as a condition for access or services. Others include Iowa, North Dakota, Oklahoma. \u00bbPROBLEMATIC BECAUSE Evidence demonstrates that face masks are an effective means to control the spread of respiratory diseases, and they are less restrictive than alternative measures.Shifts in Authority \u00bbWHAT THESE TYPES OF LAWS DO Moves legal authority from one level or branch of government to another level or branch of government; \u00bbEXAMPLES Senate Bill 379 in Arkansas authorized a Legislative Council to terminate a Governor's declaration of emergency or a Board of Health directive. Others include Arkansas, Florida, New York, Ohio, West Virginia \u00bbPROBLEMATIC BECAUSE moving legal authority away from public health agencies and from the executive branch to the legislative branch may devalue expertise and elevate short -term political popularity over necessary but unappealing action. Some bills and laws may not be constitutional. Limits on PH and Executive Orders \u00bbWHAT THESE TYPES OF LAWS DO limits authority to address a public health emergency and may block reasonable public health measures \u00bbEXAMPLES Indiana Senate Bill 5 prohibits local health officers from imposing local emergency orders that are more stringent than those issued by the governor during a declared state of emergency, unless approved by the local legislative body. Others include Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio. \u00bbPROBLEMATIC BECAUSE local health officers are generally in the best position to determine whether local conditions warrant a heightened response, and are likely to be able to act more quickly than a local legislative bodyChoosing Individual Rights Over Common Good \u00bbWHAT THESE TYPES OF LAWS DO Protect individual Constitutional rights, including rights to: peaceful assembly, free exercise of religion, and bear arms, even when exercising these rights threatens community health \u00bbEXAMPLES Montana House Bill 230 protects the individual right of physical attendance at religious services. Others include Idaho, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Florida \u00bbPROBLEMATIC BECAUSE By treating individual liberties as nearly absolute rights, these laws may place the rights (and health) of other individuals in the community at risk, as where physical attendance at religious services may enable the spread of infectious disease, and interfere with public health efforts to contain spread in the communityPromising Trends \u00bbPower to tax and spend \u00bbPower to alter the informational environment \u00bbPower to alter the built environment \u00bbPower to alter the socioeconomic environment \u00bbDirect regulation \u2014not the only option!! \u00bbIndirect regulation through the tort system \u00bbDeregulation (when law is a barrier to public health)Tools of Public Health Law Source : LAWRENCE GOSTIN , PUBLIC HEALTH LAW: POWER , DUTY, RESTRAINT 2838 (2008, 2nded.).\u00bbEffective \u00bbInformed by Expertise, Emerging Evidence, and Lived Experience \u00bbEquitable and Anti - Racist \u00bbHas Access to Resources (Human, Financial, Data, Infrastructure)\u00bbAble to Act Quickly and Lead Adaptively \u00bbTransparent and Democratic \u00bbTrusted by the Community \u00bbCompetent, Confident Resilient \u00bbBalanced between the Common Good and Individual RightsWe Need a Public Health System that is:Strengthen Public Health and Public Health AuthorityFunding Infrastructure Workforce Public Health Interventions and Emergency OrdersHealth EquityGovernanceBright SpotsPublic Health Interventions/ Emergency Orders \u00bbWHAT THESE TYPES OF LAWS DO Empower public health officials and others to take action to protect community health, while designed to restrict individual liberties no more than is reasonable and necessary \u00bbEXAMPLES Maine LD 1 COVID 19 Patient Bill of Rights \u2014requires health insurance providers to cover COVID -19 screening, testing, and vaccine costs at no cost to the patient \u00bbHELPFUL BECAUSE While some individuals sought to be free of a requirement to obtain COVID vaccines (as a condition of employment, for example), other individuals wished to obtain COVID screening, testing, and vaccination, but may have been concerned that costs would be imposed during the pandemic or in the future. Ensuring that those who seek vaccination are not barred by cost protects community health.What else \"Counts\" as a Public Health Intervention/ Exercise of Public Health Authority? \u00bbSafety Net Legislation Eviction Moratoria Unemployment Benefits and Paid Sick Leave Access to Green Space \u00bbClimate, Environment, and Environmental Justice Legislation Washington State Healthy Environment for All (HEAL) Act Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in Illinois \u00bbMental Health Indiana and Louisiana teacher training re trauma and ACEs States begin to implement 988, national suicide prevention hotline Expanded Telehealth (including MAT and OAT for substance use disorder)Funding \u00bbWHAT THESE TYPES OF LAWS DO Establish stable, predictable funding streams, providing a strong foundation for a sound public health system \u00bbEXAMPLES Include \u00bbFoundational Public Health Services (Washington) \u00bbPublic Health Modernization (Oregon) \u00bbPublic Health Transformation (Kentucky) \u00bbState Action for Public Health Excellence (Massachusetts) \u00bbHELPFUL BECAUSE Predictable funding streams support long - term planning and ongoing implementation, as well as helping to attract and retain a skilled, dedicated workforce with the capacity to address ongoing and emerging public health challengesHealth Equity \u00bbWHAT THESE TYPES OF LAWS DO Give public health officials the authority to identify, quantify, analyze, and correct disparate health opportunities and outcomes, including those associated with race and racial discrimination \u00bbEXAMPLES \u00bbCOVID Health Equity Task Forces (Virginia SB 1296) \u00bbDeclarations of Racism as a Public Health Crisis ( Minn House of Rep HR 1, 2020 2ndspecial session) \u00bbEquitable Engagement Compensation Programs (Oregon DOT) \u00bbHELPFUL BECAUSE Public health analysis of COVID 19 morbidity and mortality demonstrated disparities associated with race, ethnicity, status as a frontline worker, and rural or urban residence, among othersGovernance \u00bbWHAT THESE TYPES OF LAWS DO Establish the manner of governing in order to achieve goals, provide checks and balances \u00bbEXAMPLES Indiana Executive Order 21 -21 establishing public health commission. Commission Report informed the governor's legislative agenda, including Senate Bill 4. https://www.in.gov/health/files/GPHC -Report -FINAL -2022 -08-01_corrected.pdf \u00bbHELPFUL BECAUSE The way in which public health (or any other government entity) takes action may support achieving societal goals, or undermine them. Government processes may increase trust and engender community support, or erode them.Infrastructure \u00bbWHAT THESE TYPES OF LAWS DO Commit the use of public funds to develop, build, and maintain critical facilities, structures, and systems that provide the foundation for public health \u00bbEXAMPLES INCLUDE \u00bbSouth Dakota SB 58 authorizing construction of a new public health lab \u00bbNumerous states have enacted laws authorizing use of funds appropriated under the federal American Rescue Plan Act \u00bbHELPFUL BECAUSE Infrastructure such as public health labs and modern IT systems support early detection, surveillance, and prevention of disease, including rapid, secure, and useful communication of data, as well as other day to day public health functions. In addition, they provide jobsWorkforce \u00bbWHAT THESE TYPES OF LAWS DO Support the public health workforce by providing protection from threats and harassment; providing additional pay in recognition of service during a public health emergency; providing systemic supports to address trauma and foster resilience; and providing education and training opportunities to recruit and retain a professional public health workforce \u00bbEXAMPLES \u00bbColorado HB 1041 is an example of a \" doxxing law\" to protect the personal information of public officials, public employees, or all persons. Other examples include laws in Oklahoma and Oregon \u00bbHELPFUL BECAUSE The public health workforce served at the frontlines of the COVID pandemic, and is integral to a positive vision (and reality) for public health in the future.Pendulum SwingsWill There be a Return to Center?
