Allergen immunotherapy may be an effective option for patients with latex allergy, and vaccines play an increasingly important role in the prevention and control of allergic diseases. Creative Biolabs is a world leader in the field of vaccine development. With our extensive experience and advanced platform, we are therefore confident in offering the best vaccine development services for allergic disease. Introduction of Latex Allergy Latex, also known as natural rubber, is obtained from the rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis. Natural rubber latex allergy was identified as an increasingly significant health care problem in the late 1980s. Though the incidence of latex allergy has decreased in the United States in the past few years, there are still 150,000 to 1 million healthcare workers and more than 15 million people worldwide suffering from latex allergy. Natural rubber latex contains thirteen proven allergenic proteins, designated Hev b 1 to Hev b 13 (see Table 1), which can elicit a hypersensitive immune response in the latex-responsive population and may lead to death if severe (anaphylaxis). Among them, Hev b 1 and Hev b 3 mainly cause reactions in patients with spina bifida, Hev b 2 and Hev b 4 may play a more important role in health care workers with latex allergy. Hev b 5 is the main allergen for most health care workers and children with latex allergy and Hev b 7 may be associated with adults with latex allergy rather than children. Avoidance of all relevant latex allergens is critical in the management of patients with latex allergy. Table 1. Defined latex allergens. (Rolland. 2008) DNA Vaccines Recombinant DNA technology allows expression of latex allergens for improved immunological characterization and structural modification via genetic engineering as a prelude to safer latex immunotherapy. The simple expression of deglycosylated latex allergens using bacterial systems can reduce or ablate IgE reactivity in cases of allergens where the major IgE-reactive sites of the native molecule are the carbohydrate moieties. DNA vaccines encoding latex allergen Hev b 5 and Hev b 6 are suitable for latex glove-allergic patients and are effective in inhibiting IgE. Thus, recombinant strategies are available for each of the major allergens of relevance for developing a vaccine for latex glove-allergic patients. T Cell Epitope Peptides Vaccines Another promising approach to treating allergic diseases is peptide immunotherapy (vaccines) using short synthetic peptides based on the dominant T cell epitopes of allergens. The use of short linear peptides allows the retention of T cell activation without cross-linking effector cell-bound IgE, which may trigger an allergic response. Dominant T cell-reactive sites are currently mapped for Hev b 1, Hev b 3, Hev b 5, Hev b 6.01, and Hev b 6.03. In addition, another method of designing hypoallergenic allergen peptides vaccine is to synthesize short peptides with amino acid substitutions to disrupt potential IgE binding activity. These peptide variants show maintenance of T cell reactivity but no basophil-activating activity.
