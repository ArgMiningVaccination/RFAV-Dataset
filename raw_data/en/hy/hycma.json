Thanks to their isolated but solid, effective and intense efforts, eight Waldorf Schools and ten kindergartens were founded, and activities emerged in the fields of special needs education, medicine and publishing. All of these initiatives are closely linked to the young Anthroposophical Society and also have global connections. In mid- June the European country representatives were able to experience this special Baltic situation during their summer meeting in Tartu. Cultural hues and individual influences Just a few miles from today's east-west border to Russia, it is interesting to come across a comment Rudolf Steiner made in a discussion ( ga 337b, 6 September 1920), implying that the Baltic peoples are particularly karmically disposed to develop real cosmopolitan consciousness - or fall into isolating nationalism. It became tangible in this gathering how a global anthroposophical community arises on the one hand from the consonance of countries and cultural hues, and how, on the other hand, it relies entirely and exclusively on individuals. The consultations focused mainly on how this contrast is reflected in the Statutes of the An - throposophical Society: how the reality of the zeitgeist and the inspirations of the School of Spiritual Science have to come to life through the principle of the 1923/1924 Christmas Conference (connecting from person to person) in a kind of social double-domed building, and how, in this \u00abmost modern\u00bb society, the competence of the School and the shared social life come together, even in the Statutes. Now we are looking forward to the Mystery Drama cycle that will be performed at the Goetheanum in the summer and to the inten - sive Education Section conference during which Rudolf Steiner's 1919 course on the foundations of Waldorf education can be experienced again in its entirety after a hundred years of teaching experience.

At a time when humanity is crossing the threshold, we are in need of spiritualized thinking, nature observation and Michaelic communities. As we cross the threshold we sense, deep in our souls, the proximity of death forces, but because of this we also experience our true, immortal-cosmic dimension lighting up. As a result, more and more people can remember earlier incarnations or have concrete premoni - tions and experiences of nature's spirituality and their own higher self. Some speak of having met the Christ. Closeness to death and the yearning for immortality or for spirituality are effective, though still largely unknown, factors that pro - foundly determine our lives today. Christ - helper at the threshold Many hopes and fears are linked to this, because the powers of evil, too, become tangible at the threshold. Rudolf Steiner said that Michael, through whose being Christ reveals himself in a new spiritual form, is the great helper at the threshold to the supersensible world. He also said that the initiation principle should become a civilization principle today. Michael works in two ways: firstly, by spiri - tualizing our thinking forces into free, visionary heart-thinking, a process in which feeling and will are also transformed; and secondly by spiri - tualizing our view of nature. Since true anthro - posophy is a synthesis of science, art and religion, the arts and religious experience are included in this transformative process. This gives us two sides of a golden triangle: the spiritualization of consciousness both in relation to the inner world and to the outer world of the senses, with its practical implications. This inner alchemy awakens concrete impulses in us for our social and professional life. And this points us to the third side of the triangle, the base, which is related to our co-existence as human beings - in relation to Michael. With his work, Rudolf Steiner intended to found a com - munity that can stand up to the oppositional powers, so that the cultural mission of anthro - posophy can be even more intensely realized. There have been individuals again and again who tried not only to establish cultural institutions out of the spirit of anthroposophy, but also to make the golden triangle a social reality.Rudolf Steiner gave a few examples of this when he wrote about the Michael Mystery on 16 No - vember 1924, in ga 26, in the chapter The World- Thoughts in the Working of Christ and in the Working of Ahriman (see quotation on page 2). Borrowing from St Paul's Hymn to Love in the first letter to the Corinthians, one could say that clairvoyance and mystery wisdom, scholarly works on Michael or the \u00abFoundation Stone of Love\u00bb of the 1923-24 Christmas Conference, or even amendments to the statutes and articles are merely \u00aba sounding brass or a tinkling cym - bal\u00bb if Michaelic thinking is without love. Love completes the golden triangle of Michael's working. The threshold becomes bridge I am aware that original thoughts, artistic inspira - tions or genuine religious exultation don't appear at the push of a button. Like the impulses of gen - uine, selfless love, they must be seen as a grace. But we can wish, or strive, for love. We can con - sciously struggle for selfless love, even if we fail again and again. And, yes, we can pray for it. As a preliminary step on the way to love we can form genuine Michael communities by being deeply accepting of others who may think differently. We could rename the book How to Attain Knowledge of the Higher Worlds for our time and call it How to become conscious of the power of love in the soul. When it comes to the Anthropo - sophical Society, true Michaelic thinking would truly further social life. The threshold would become a bridge. Imagine, in all earnestness, a rebirth of the Anthroposophical Society out of the spirit of love. A utopian dream? | Mario Betti, Pl\u00fcderhausen ( de) Pause For Thought Anthroposophy Worldwide.

When we strive to act free- ly but act out of egoism, on the other hand, when freedom becomes pride in manifesting ourselves in our actions, then we are in danger of falling into Ahriman's sphere. [...] When we feel that we are free and close to Michael, we are on the way to carry the po- wer of intellectuality into our whole being; we think with the head but the heart feels thinking's bright light or darkness; the will radiates out our being because the thoughts stream in the will as intentions. We become more and more human as we become an expression of the world. [...] If we follow Michael, we cultivate love in relation to the outer world, [...] then the love for the world can radiate back to our own self, which is then able to love without loving itself. It is on the paths of such love that our soul can find the Christ. If we stay close to Michael, we cultivate love in relation to the outer world, and, in doing so, find the relation to our inner soul world that unites us with the Christ.

Deposits for more than 220 tickets have already been paid for the 2022 East-West Congress in Vienna. We are now looking for at least the same number of people again who are prepared to pay a deposit of 100 Euros per ticket so that we can hire our preferred venue: the Vienna Konzerthaus. This venue is a five minute walk away from the Vienna Musikverein, where Ru - dolf Steiner held the East West Congress of 1922. At the end of May we had a conversation with the director of the Vienna Konzerthaus, Matthias Naske. Although his grandmother was an active anthroposophist, this will unfortunately not make any difference to the rental charges we have to pay. After our very open conversation, the signing of the rental agreement is now envisaged for the end of September 2019. This means that we can extend the registration period until then! The best way to help at this stage is to spread the news as quickly and widely as possible that \u00abRudolf Steiner will be in Vienna - represented by the achievements of anthroposophy in the various spheres of life so far!\u00bb After all, who of us would not wish to be there if they could actually meet Rudolf Steiner as an individual, like a hundred years ago? We have already found many cooperating partners, including the Goetheanum, the An - throposophical Society in Germany, the Euro - pean Co-operation in Anthroposophical Curative Education and Social therapy ( ecce ), Socialartist. events, the Friends of Rudolf Steiner Education/ Emergency Education, Eliant and the Christian Community. | Wolfgang Schaffer, Anthroposophi - cal Society in AustriaNetherlands Thanking Jaap Sijmons On 8 June Jaap Sijmons stood down as coun - cil chairman and general secretary of the An - throposophical Society in the Netherlands. The Anthroposophical Society in the Netherlands thanked Jaap Sijmons for his commitment. Mr Si - jmons became chairman as well as general secre - tary of the Dutch Society in 2014. His successors for the two positions are Pim Blomaard (follow - ing an almost unanimous vote) and Rik ten Cate, respectively. Rik ten Cate started on his new task in May (Anthroposophy Worldwide 5/2019). When Jaap Sijmons started in office he had to deal with a difficult situation caused by conflicts within the council management, but under his direction the new council was able to regain the trust of the membership. It was also dur - ing his term in office that the much-discussed decision was taken to buy the Vreedehuis in The Hague (Anthroposophy Worldwide 3/2018). In addition, Jaap Sijmons strengthened the ties with the Goetheanum, sat for three years on the extended Executive Council meetings and gave a number of lectures. He conveyed his best wishes to his successors for the preparation of the forthcoming centenary of the 1923-24 Christ - mas Conference, and added, \u00abI am of course not saying goodbye to the Anthroposophical Society and will soon be at the Goetheanum for a whole week of Esoteric Science, with Christiane Haid, Michael Debus and Christian Hitsch. I also hope to finish writing a few things I have started in recent years.\u00bb | Sebastian J\u00fcngelGeneral Anthroposophical Society Specialist group for oncology On 22 May 2019, the specialist group for on - cology has been integrated into the Anthro- posophical Society. Anthroposophic Oncology is a specialist branch within the Medical Section that will from now on be embedded in the Anthroposophical Society. Its present members are haemato-oncologists from Switzerland and Germany. Two registrars who are training to be haemato-oncologists also belong to the group. They strive to deepen their spiritual-scientific understanding of cancer and to derive therapies from this understanding. On the basis of this they also look together at meaningful ways of dealing with the confusing multitude of tar - geted therapies and other treatment methods prevalent in oncology today. Another essential task for the group members is the representa - tion of anthroposophic oncology to the outside world, in the public and scientific discourse. This kind of specialist work brings the An - throposophical Society directly in contact with the practice of caring for cancer patients. The Anthroposophical Society, on the other hand, can also help to carry and support this work and include it in the wider context of the other anthroposophical spheres of life. We are pleased that, after the specialist group for palliative medicine, the oncologists have also decided to form a specialist group that is integrated into the Anthroposophical Society. | Matthias Conference to 6 June 2022 Web www.ost-west.wien Contact buero@anthroposophie.or.at Image Organizers Ulrike und die Entwicklung der Welt, on Rudolf Steiner's Esoteric Science (formerly Occult Science), 15 to 20 July 2019, Goetheanum Web www.goetheanum.org/tagungen/der- mensch-und-die-entwicklung-der-welt Image Long-serving general Rudolf 314) 4 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 7-8/19 Antroposophy Worldwide Africa Human development From 27 August to 3 September the second All Africa Anthroposophic Training will take place in Zimbabwe. It is about human development and social competence. The All Africa Anthroposophic Training has five modules. They can be attended individually or as a package. Over a period of five years, the participants meet one week a year. The first module took place in 2018 in Nairobi (Anthro - posophy Worldwide 10/2018). The concept of the intensive courses includes meeting colleagues from other cultures by learning about topics of mutual interest and living under one roof. In addition, the surrounding community supports a Goethean view of nature. The training is about understanding human beings independently of the profession they are involved in. The second module is devoted to questions such as: What is life? What makes human beings individually and socially life- worthy? How are living beings connected? And how can we apply this wisdom about life in daily practice? In the second module, the eurythmic gestures of the planetary movements and zodiac signs are introduced in such a way that the participants experience the seven Life Processes, which they also develop through Goethean observation. There will be an introduction to the basics of organic and biodynamic agriculture, Waldorf education, anthroposophic medicine and chil - dren with special needs. Participants learn about celebrating the festivals of the year as the basis of a new family culture. They will also learn how the idea of a Threefold Social Order can work for Africa. | Compiled from the program flyer by Sebastian J\u00fcngelTurkey Introduction to biodynamic farming For the first time a public course on biody - namic farming took place in Turkey . On 5 and 6 April we organized Turkey's first in - troduction to biodynamic farming on our farm in \u00c7atalca, Istanbul. It was a perfect meeting with a great group! Our Demeter consultant, partner and trainer with whom we have worked together for more than five years is Hans Supenkaemper, whose knowledge of biodynamic agriculture and anthroposophy motivated all participants. [Of the fifteen participants three were student Waldorf teachers; there were also inspectors, professors, farmers who are interested in the biodynamic method, as well as staff members of Hermes Textiles and a rose oil manufacturer. Ed.] As Ali Kemal Ayan, who attended from Samsun's 19 May University, said \u00abBiodynamic farming is the alchemy of agriculture.\u00bb We hardly noticed the time passing during our external and internal journeys. During the course, we examined the biodynamic prepara - tions in theoretical and practical terms and re - moved the soil fertilizer, silica, dandelion and oak bark preparations from our soil. We also studied the first lecture in Rudolf Steiner's Agriculture Course and went through the subject so amaz - ingly that we can say that we have returned to our roots. Our courses will continue in different seasons. We thank all participants.

Waldorf Education has given a new meaning to the lives of millions of people all over the world, not just for children, but to all people in all walks of life. I was wondering as to how I could pay a tribute to our dear Dr Ru- dolf Steiner, who has made this form of educa - tion possible. So I said to myself, why not write a poem, which can be recited as a rap? The words came easily and the \u00abUrauffuehrung\u00bb (premiere) happened to be on an evening during the agm at the Goetheanum. It was very well received and I was encouraged to present it at the Kindergar - ten conference and the Youth conference which followed at the Goetheanum. I have also sent it by email to various schools, institutions and of course to my friends and students: It was in the year nineteen-nineteen, When the end of the First World War had been. There came to Dr Rudolf Steiner a friend, Who wanted a school in order to send The children of the workers of his factory, And thus began the Waldorf story. Emil Molt was the factory head, With compassion and foresight his staff he led. Rudolf Steiner fulfilled Emil Molt's dream, Giving lectures to the new Waldorf teachers' team. An education based upon his spiritual insight, Of the three-fold aspect of strength, warmth and light. A curriculum that meets the needs of the child, That they may grow to be truthful, brave and kind (mild). On the wings of Anthroposophy, east to China, As also to the west, to Argen-taina, (to rhyme with China). With India and many other countries in between, Remember, now we're in twenty-nineteen! So! Waldorf Education is here to stay. For future generations Waldorf lights the way, That they may grow up without conflict and strife. There is hope for children from all walks of life! | Aban Bana, Mumbai ( in)Worldwide Waldorf history Nana G\u00f6bel has published a detailed history of the Waldorf movement in three volumes. Nana G\u00f6bel has used the centenary as an op - portunity to write down the history of Waldorf schools worldwide. Her book illustrates how everything that happens is linked to people: thousands of teachers and educators, school founders and inspirers. A karmic community emerges that, across three generations, resolved to bring to earth an education that is in tune with human nature. The destinies of people and of the art of edu - cation are intimately interwoven: did you know that, in 1980, Portugal was about to introduce the Waldorf method in all its primary schools but that this was prevented by tragic accidents that occurred in the government two days after the decision was taken? Or how amazingly modern, from the social threefolding point of view, the school administration bill was that was passed on 11 September 1918 in Armenia? Who knew how fiercely and frequently the anthroposophi - cal movement and the school movement have been attacked? For instance in France, where there was a massive attempt by secret services and the ministries in 1999 to corroborate the ac - cusation of sectarianism of 1982 - much of this is still virulent in other European states. The further we go back in time the more determined and idealistic the colleagues in the Waldorf Schools seem to have been - unperturbed by social and economic upheavals. We also find cross-references, for instance when we hear about Ernst Weissert in connec - tion with an autonomous, in 1921 (Jena-Zw\u00e4tzener P\u00e4dago - gischer Arbeitskreis) and then again as a founder of the Friends of Rudolf Steiner Education in 1976. It is almost unimaginable how one person alone has been able to carry out, and record, such extensive research into dates, names, facts, contexts and events - and worldwide at that! | Christof Wiechert, Goetheanum and The Hague ( nl)Germany Waldorf Festival From 7 to 10 June, around 1700 people came together at Schloss Hamborn (de) to celebrate Waldorf 100 with music and with lectures on the tasks of the school movement. \u00abThis is Waldorf Woodstock\u00bb, said one of the 1700 guests of the Waldorf Festival, as everyone was listening to the bands that played late into the night on the large green, before they withdrew to the many tents in the camping area. It all started when educator Mischka Kaiser had the idea to organize a summer festival to cel - ebrate the centenary. The huge park-like campus of Schloss Hamborn, which encompasses an old castle, a Waldorf School, residential areas and a nursing home, is the perfect venue for such a festival. Work groups for adults on education and theatre, circus and sports activities for the younger generation alternated with lectures. Speaker Henning Kullack-Ublick referred to the field of tension between the increase of offi - cial regulation and the individualization of the students. Gerald H\u00e4fner spoke of the Waldorf School as both a creation of and a laboratory for social threefolding. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler discussed the tasks of the Waldorf School in the digital age, and Wolfgang Held spoke, in that context, of the Waldorf teacher's inner work as the essence of Waldorf education. Claus-Peter R\u00f6h looked at how the day and night aspects of the human being, in other words environment and initia - tive, play into each other. That so many young people came to the festival was probably due to the evening and late-night programme with bands and music groups for which no expense had been spared. The residents of the nursing home right next to the concert venue could also listen to the blues and samba sounds that drifted across and enjoy the picturesque sight of the trees that were illuminated after dark. At the end the wish was expressed that there should be a similar event next year. | Wolfgang Held, GoetheanumBook Nana 2019 (awsna Publications is planning an English translation of volume 1) Source Journal of the Education Section at the Goetheanum, issue 66 (edited). Web www.waldorf-festival.de Image Something for all ages: Waldorf Festival at Hamborn Castle 6 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 7-8/19 This special event will be co-carried by the School of Spiritual Science at the Goetheanum and the General Section of the Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain. It offers a rare opportunity to experience a full overview of this path, given as free renderings in English. New insights and perspectives Invitations via email have been sent to members of the School across the world, as experience from the previous such conference in London five years ago, shows that Class members for whom English is their mother tongue or second language were willing to travel from as far as Australia and Canada to participate. Class mem - bers from non-English speaking countries also participated to hear the Class content given in English. This in itself can reveal new insights and perspectives. The English language will be of particular im - portance at this conference as we will hear, for the first time, the new English translation of the bi-lingual Goetheanum edition of the Class texts and mantra. Many subtle questions arise regarding translations which German speakers need not address. For example, how does one translate \u00abO Mensch...\u00bb? Is it: \u00abO Man\u00bb (main - ly used in Great Britain), or \u00abHuman Being...\u00bb (mainly used in North America) or \u00abO Human One...\u00bb (sometimes used in Australia)? This il - lustrates some cultural differences even within the English language itself. Or how does one translate the all-important word \u00abErnst\u00bb? Cur - rently it is translated into English as \u00abearnest,\u00bb but it is felt that this is not quite adequate. For some \u00abadmonition\u00bb is problematic due to its as - sociation with \u00abreprimand\u00bb and will be replaced with other terms according to the context. More direct and lively When Rudolf Steiner spoke in England it was noticeable that he was less philosophical and more direct and lively. When he came to England after completing the 19 Class Lessons in Dorn - ach in early August 1924, he gave a further four Class Lessons. Sadly, there is only a transcript of Recapitulation Lesson 7, given in London on 27 August, known as the \u00abLondon Lesson\u00bb. It is noticeable that after the London visit the re - maining recapitulation Lessons acquired a more specific Michaelic tone. In the years following Rudolf Steiner's death, controversy arose regarding how, and indeed whether, to continue with Class work. One lead - ing member considered that, \u00abas Rudolf Steiner had not appointed his successor to carry on the esoteric work, it should wait until his return\u00bb. There were also arguments regarding who had permission to use certain translations. Tensions deepened when, in 1928, the former General Secretary and Class Holder Harry Collinson, cre - ated the Rudolf Steiner Union, on the model of Albert Steffen's German language Union. This organisation then withdrew from the British Society and attached itself to Dornach. It was recognised however, that the First Class was common ground between the two organisa - tions. It was only in 1970 that the Union, later called the English Section, dissolved and moved to Rudolf Steiner House to reunite with the An - throposophical Society in Great Britain. This Society had been founded in September 1923 in the presence of Rudolf Steiner, who agreed to be its lifelong honorary President. Annual Class conference Throughout the years of division the Class Les - sons continued to be read, and gradually more groups formed and free renderings began fol - lowed by Class conferences and discussion groups working in varied ways. Today there are some 50 Class Holders in Great Britain. Every Summer the General Section of the An - throposophical Society in Great Britain holds a Class conference on various aspects of the journey through the 19 Lessons. This year from 22 to 26 August we will once again encompass the totality of the 19 Lessons. All Class members are most warmly invited to join us as a community of global sisters and brothers. | Marjatta van Boeschoten, general secretary of the Anthropo - sophical Society in Great Britain School of Spiritual Science Information (brochure or accommodation): Ilona Pimbert, phone +44 207 members: venue of the \u00ab19 Class Lessons\u00bb conferenceClass Lessons in English The 19 Class Lessons in London From 22 to 26 August there will be a conference encompassing the 19 Class Lessons of the School of Spiritual Science at Rudolf Steiner House in London for members of the School from around the world. Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 7-8/19 | 7 School of Spiritual Science Section for the Performing Arts Speech School amwort turns 10 After the closure of two schools there was no speech training left in Dornach. Then, ten years ago now, amwort was founded. Amwort started as a full-time training, then turned part-time and is now again one of the full-time trainings registered by the Interna - tional Association of Speech Schools within the Section for the Performing Arts. It has presently 40 students. The artistic training is the heart of the School's curriculum; the therapeutic speech training leads to a qualification as art therapist specialized in speech and drama (in Switzerland state-recog - nized); further training for speech therapists in schools was added in November 2018, and from August 2019 there will be a modular further training course in logopaedic therapy. Every student has one one-to-one lesson per week to enhance individual development. The length of the training depends on previous experience and qualifications. The highlights in the study year are perfor - mances by all students and their individual grad - uation programmes. The work of the speech cho - rus is impressive because it sounds like one voice. Presentations, such as on biographies of poets, individual sounds, anthroposophical aspects of speech and speech development, educational or therapeutic topics, and the topics chosen by students for their thesis, contribute to the lesson content. Amwort graduates have gone on to work in Switzerland, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Estonia, the US and South Africa. Faculty members Agnes Zehnter, Monika Gas - ser, Kirstin Kaiser and Dietrich von Bonin are concerned about the future of this art because student numbers are low worldwide. | Agnes Zehnter, amwort faculty memberHumanities Section Great Britain Healing the wounds of Europe World War One represented a deep trauma for the soul of Europe, the effects of which we are still living with. A conference in London on 14 and 15 September will focus on ways of healing these wounds. The crisis we have been experiencing over Brexit clearly reveals that the right relationship of Britain, Europe and the world remains an unsolved riddle. The name of the event springs from the aware - ness that there will be no solution to this riddle until we can recognize the deep existential wounds Europe suffers from, and until we begin to ask, in a good spirit, serious and wide-ranging questions about what ails it and about what it may need for its healing. The aim of the event is not to argue for or against existing mainstream approaches, but rather to arrive at new perspectives and possible ways forward, which strive to go beyond the stark divisions we increasingly witness around us. We will do this through profound and searching presentations by Terry Boardmann (GB) on the echoes and parallels of 1919 and 2019 and by Wil - bert Lambrechts (BE) about the question of what a nation actually is. In addition, we will explore the theme through artistic performances, which have also arisen through deep involvement with the wounds of Europe and their possible heal - ing, as well as through the participation in open conversation with everyone present. | Richard Ramsbotham, Stroud ( gb)Economic Conference/ Education Section Financial Literacy Within the framework of the Economics Conference and the Education Section at the Goetheanum, Fionn Meier researches 'Finan - cial Literacy for the 21st Century'. The question of taking responsibility for one's own finances has been a concern, especially for Benediktus Hardorp in his study of the sig - nificance of double-entry bookkeeping as an \u00abinstrument of the consciousness soul\u00bb, and through the work of the Economics Conference at the Goetheanum (economics.goetheanum. org/literature). As an ambassador for finan - cial literacy supported by several institutions and within the framework of a research project overseen by Christopher Houghton Budd (coor - dinator of the Economic Conference) and Florian Osswald (co-director of the Education Section), I am developing together with colleagues a con - cept Financial Literacy for the 21st Century as a contribution to today's debates. Nowadays, we live in a transition from ob - jective to dematerialised money. Meaning what precisely? The idea of money as book - keeping ( ga 340) can serve as an orientation for understanding money as a mirror that allows one to recognize economic processes and shape them together. Every human being comes to earth with an impulse to bring something new into the world. But an obstacle to this is the idea of selling one's work which prevents one from taking responsi - bility for one's own work, in turn a prerequisite for finding one's life's task. ( ga 135, lecture of 21 February 1912). Everyone - whether employed or not - can use double-entry bookkeeping to awaken in oneself an awareness of one's re - sponsibility as an independent entrepreneur of the purpose and goal of one's task. Imagining the realization of an idea, right into its concrete finances by way of a financial plan, is an effort of will that is effective in the world and makes it possible to observe whether one is still on course. Self-reflection, transparency, communication can also be learned in the field of finance as a social process. From a common overview of capital and ideas, capital can be brought into circulation in such a way that everyone's news can come healthily into the world. | Fionn Meier, Zurich ( ch), English by Christopher Houghton Budd Web www.atka.ch Image Speech choir rehearsalConference Healing the Wounds of Europe.

Its title is Soul Courage and Self-Transformation at the Threshold and the conference languages will be German and English. Birth and death are thresholds of transition be - tween the spiritual and the earthly worlds. It is the soul that mediates between spirit and body as it receives the new-born child into the earthly world and prepares for crossing the threshold again at the end of earthly life. In our time both thresholds are increasingly open to conscious and technological access and control. And yet, we all experience how both crossings of the threshold are not merely ex - ternal processes: expectation, reverence and joy usually surround the birth of a child, while uncertainty, fear and pain often prevail in the face of death. Our daily falling asleep and waking up are like images of the two thresholds. They allow us to practise making the transition from the spiritual world to the earth and from the earth to the spiritual world more conscious. In the night, when the soul is free from the body, it experiences a wider consciousness and develops new faculties that can then become effective in daily life. A smooth crossing of the thresholds of sleeping and waking and of birth and death seems to become increasingly dif - ficult: the soul needs to consciously develop courage to meet the unknown. It is therefore an increasingly important task in our time to find and foster the mood of soul that is equal to both threshold experiences.| Joan Sleigh, Matthias Girke and Johannes K\u00fchl, GoetheanumSection for Social Sciences et al. The Soul of Europe From 23 to 25 August the tenth Soul of Europe conference - Facing Europe's Challenges - will take place in Brussels be (in German, English and French). In light of the course of events over the last de - cade, it seems that the future of Europe and the eu has never been so much at the centre of people's attention and forefront of politi - cal debate as today. Overwhelmed by recur - ring economic crises, the influx of refugees, terrorism, strengthened national self-interest and shifting political landscapes, Europe finds itself amidst a number of unprecedented social challenges. Efforts of the European Union to build an ever closer union based on solidarity among its Member States and the motto to stand united in diversity, are seriously chal - lenged. In the face of these events, the call for social renewal based on the threefolding ideas set out by Rudolf Steiner a hundred years ago, seems more relevant than ever! The question arises, however, as to how we can work with these ideas in today's realities and which human qualities we need in order to develop a sustainable and inclusive future in Europe and beyond. How can we awaken the transformative power of the individual? One way could be by balancing diversity, solidarity and unity and by exchanging views and ideas for a common vision on Europe's mission and future.

With its School of anthroposophical spiritual science, its park and library, its regular events, the General Anthroposophical Society has much to offer to its specific target group. Making all this available based on professional communication is a complex task, which the Goetheanum, with Sebastian J\u00fcngel and his team, master with remarkable ease. A broad range of contents, a sure sense for well-told sto - ries and the ability to balance budget restrictions with its own professional productions make the Goetheanum a model ngo .

Christiane Haid will continue as programme manager. Thomas Didden sees the oldest anthroposophi - cal publishing firm, founded by Marie Steiner and Johanna M\u00fccke in Berlin in 1908 ( de), as a provider of services. \u00abThe value is created by the authors\u00bb, he says. His main tasks will therefore include the publishing activities of the School of Spiritual Science, the publication of anthropo - sophical studies and of works, mostly in German, that are of cultural and spiritual interest. Recent publications include: the correspon - dence between the poet Rainer Maria Rilke and the Goetheanum actor Elya Maria Nevar, as well as the correspondence, during their Dornach period, between Andrei Bely and Natasha Pozzo, the sister of Assia Turgenev. Later in the sum - mer there will be a book by Elisa Wannert with indications and inspirations for painters titled Vom Farbklang zum Bildmotiv (from colour tone to motif). Further publications that are closely connected with the work of the Goetheanum Sections include a commentary on Rudolf Stein - er's The Inner Nature of Music ( ga 283), a study entitled Apokalypse im Ich (apocalypse in the I), and a commentary on Rudolf Steiner's first medical course ( ga 312) scheduled to come out in early 2020. There are also a few English pub - lications, for instance: The Dignity of the Young Child, volume 1, and the bilingual edition (English, German) of the Class Lessons of the School of Spiritual Science which is envisaged for 2020 (the corresponding German edition will be published at the same time by Rudolf Steiner Verlag). \u00abIt is our task to make these works available to book stores and to make anthroposophy visible in the world,\u00bb says Thomas Didden.

The production of Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dra - mas at the Goetheanum is both old and new, both established and fresh: it is established be - cause the Goetheanum Stage has performed it for nine years, and new because a new eurythmy ensemble means that all scenes had to be re - worked. Gioia Falk, who is artistic director and in charge of the production, points out that \u00abI myself have developed; I see the dramas dif - ferently now than I did at the beginning. And a new audience has formed.\u00bb The continuity in the casting of the play has allowed the protagonists to evolve; for over a decade, the free ensemble has each time come together for this at the Goetheanum. As Christian Peter, the dramatic director for this production, reveals, special plans are un - derway for this summer. Several conferences, each aimed at specific interests and professional groups, will take place at the same time, all of them concluding in the Mystery Drama Festival, so that the drama's full dynamic is pooled in one cycle. The convoluted developments in Ru - dolf Steiner's plays then serve as a lens through which today's questions and challenges can be understood at a deeper level and in a way that is closer to life. Experienced speakers from crisis areas, from medicine and education will complement the programme. Could these plans become a tradition as it hap - pened with Parzival elsewhere, I ask.

One outcome of the 2018 agm clearly took many members aback. The Swiss are more proficient than other nations when it comes to voting (having several referen - dums every year at national, can - ton and parish level), but this is not the place to discuss the value and limitations of the Swiss law of associations. What puzzled me when I read your letter was that you seem to feel, and judge, that the decision made then by more than 60 per cent of members present was disconcerting. Did no one, in the many conversations you mention, ask about the inner and outer conditions leading to that vote? You quote solemn words by Ru - dolf Steiner in your letter. May we increasingly succeed in unfolding the moral power of those words. You seem to assume that, at the time, many members were wrong and that forgiveness would have been appropriate. But how can we overcome the frequent sweep - ing preconceptions that come to nothing, and replace them with thorough scrutiny, similar to the condensed, objective way in which a physician takes the patient's history? Motions sub - mitted to the agm also arise from such concrete will application, for instance in relation to the finan - cial situation. I would like to mention the fa - miliar anecdote of an old couple, where one of the two sighs during their daily game of chess, \u00abI've re - ally had enough; I've done this for decades just to please you\u00bb, and the other replies, \u00ab... but I've done it just to please you!\u00bb The little sketch shows that no problem is solved if one merely longs for harmony without ac - tively applying one's will. Building bridges means having the cour - age to face what needs changing (starting with oneself, of course). This courage requires more than goodwill; it requires genuine interest arising from a will that can overcome itself. This is what I hope for, and I also hope you will receive these lines sympatheti - cally and forgivingly. | Maja Schmid, Kreuzlingen Dornach, Switzer - land, srmk@goetheanum.ch Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 7-8/18 | 11 Antroposophical Society We have been informed that the following 50 members have crossed the threshold of death.

Devoted organist Hartmut Haupt, the fifth child of mu - sical parents, was born in Bonn ( de) in 1932. His great love for the organ was awakened by Johann Sebastian Bach's D minor Toccata and Fugue. When the family moved to Jena ( de) he developed an interest in astronomy and meteorology and began to study these subjects in 1950. When this interest failed to find fulfilment he changed to physics, a subject in which he went on to gain his doctorate. Through his first marriage he met anthroposophy which, in the gdr could only exist under the umbrella of the Christian Community. This was a turning point in his life. He gave in his notice at Jenapharm, the pharmaceutical company he worked for, in order to attend the Christian Community's Priest Seminary. Shortly before graduating, the by then head of a family returned to Jenapharm. In all those years he never stopped fostering his love for music, often sit - ting at the organ at 5.30 in the morn - ing, before going to work. For one year he was organist at the St Michael Church in Jena. In 1967 he married B\u00e4rbel Klauder and became a father again. Unusually for the gdr , Hartmut Haupt became self-employed in 1975 in monument preservation and as an organist. He inspected many organs in Thuringia and wholeheartedly supported their restoration, saving many instruments from oblivion. The cd s he made were a further contribution to the cultural life in Thuringia. Even in gdr times, he travelled to Switzerland, Russia and the United States. His musical home was the new organ he had been instrumental in acquiring for the Volkshaus, a concert and confer - ence venue in Jena. With 4800 pipes it is the biggest concert organ in Thuringia. Cultivating and interpret - ing the music of Max Reger and of his teacher Hans Georg Burkhart, was also important to him. Hartmut Haupt led an anthropo - sophical reading group and later be - came a Class holder in Jena. He and the priest Hartwig Knabe invited the Goetheanum Stage in 1988 to perform the second Mystery Drama in Jena. With the help of locally trained speech artists five performances took place with a total of 600 audience mem - bers from across Eastern Germany. After the political changes of 1989 the Anthroposophical Society was no longer banned. Hartmut Haupt contacted the then leader of the Section for the Performing Arts at the Goetheanum, Virginia Sease. She visited him - and the organs in Thuringia. As a result of this connec - tion he was consulted on questions regarding the organ in the Goethea - num's main auditorium. He would play many concerts there. Social engagement Hartmut Haupt was socially active on behalf of a child aid organization in Jena and supported the founding of a community hospital. He repre - sented the Anthroposophical Society and cause courageously in public. Until his death he played on his Bechstein grand piano which was tuned to 432 Hz. Elke Jakobeit, the priest of the Christian Community in Jena, said of Hartmut Haupt's final days, \u00abIn the end he himself was like a tone that slowly faded to a pianissimo but, in fading, grew more intensive.\u00bb | Sebastian J\u00fcngel Sources Barbara Haupt, Elke Jacobeit, Michael Kurtz, Virginia Sease, the newspaper Ost-Th\u00fcringer Zeitung of 5 June 2019 12 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 7-8/19 It is part of the karma of anthroposophists that many anthroposophical initiatives are born from a particular concern or need. This is also true for the Goetheanum's way of working with bees. Towards the end of the 1980s, pioneers of biody - namic beekeeping met with Jochen Bockem\u00fchl to talk about the spiritual dimension of bees and the appropriate way of dealing with var - roa mites. Imported from India to Europe by a German bee research institute, this parasite has spread rapidly across Europe and is now affecting bee colonies on every continent except Australia. Liquid gold In 1996, friends of apiculture together with the Natural Science Section at the Goetheanum or - ganized a conference that featured bee colonies, wild bee hotels, an \u00abapiphone\u00bb (box for listening to bees humming) and a honey extractor. Many people had the chance to watch how honey, the liquid gold, is harvested. The great success of this conference was not least due to the fact that it offered so many direct experiences. In 2014 the Section for Agriculture picked up the topic of bees for its international confer - ence. The response was overwhelming. With 400 people attending, the Schreinerei was full to bursting, and many even had to be turned away. The conference proved that sensitive apiculture exists and is being developed in various ways across the globe. The \u00abbee being\u00bb incarnates very differently depending on the continent, cultural background and the intentions of the beekeepers.The self-image of beekeepers who seek to treat bees appropriately has changed noticeably. The early struggles have given way to a sense of admiration and reverence. This change is also part of karma. It does not mean that beekeep - ers have lost sight of the serious problems sur - rounding not only the bees but all pollinators, on the contrary: the biodynamic movement has rarely been as active, socially and politically, as its beekeepers are now. They demand the rigorous reduction of pesticides and herbicides in farming, fight court cases against the use of particularly harmful insect poisons, launch petitions and request crucial structural changes in farming. At the same time the underlying mood has changed. The work with bees is no longer mo - tivated by the threatening environmental crisis. Bees are not kept in spite of, but with all the problems - the combative mood has turned into respect, sympathy and love. Bee research In 1996, bees were for the first time the subject of a research project in the Natural Science Sec - tion. Before that, Daniel Kuster, who works in the Goetheanum garden department, and I had discovered why there were no more butterflies in the meadows around the Goetheanum. We started using a method called \u00abmosaic mow - ing\u00bb which helps to create new habitats. It was not long before 20 butterfly species appeared that had not been seen for decades (some were actually on the Red List). Even the colleagues at Basel University ( ch) were surprised. I had no specific apicultural knowledge but thought that a paradise for butterflies had to be a paradise for bees too, and so I proposed a project that was then put into practice together with the beekeepers Martin Dettli and Xaver Wirth. The title of the project was \u00abBeekeep - ing without chemical varroa treatment\u00bb. We must have been the first researchers in Europe to investigate whether bee colonies can survive the mites without the use of medication. Only one colony survived for six years, but generally we had to document the dying of bees. This project marked the beginning of research into bees that is still ongoing today. Martin Det - tli examined the conditions that support varroa tolerance; I started a study on improving colony health by mixing mistletoe and Echinacea into the bee food. Presently, Eva Frey of Fischerm\u00fch - le, a bee research and teaching institute in the south of Germany, and I are investigating how varroa-tolerant behaviour is passed on among the colonies. Together with Benjamin Epler, a developer of biodynamic preparations, we are also testing a new treatment that involves work - ing mite ashes into beeswax. Teaching about bees The teaching on campus, too, is no longer con - ceivable without bees. They are part of the Goetheanum Studies and provide much appreci - ated observation experiences in seminars with both amateurs and experts. The introductory course \u00abThe beehive impulse\u00bb that stretches across six Saturdays in the apicultural year con - veys basic insights into sensitive bee-keeping. Members of the medical professions are inter - ested in the healing effect of bee substances, and - following an indication by Rudolf Stein - er - many people are keen to learn more about bees as an image of humanity's social future. This brings us full circle: starting from a spiritu - al question regarding the precarious situation of the bees we are now exploring their spiritual mis - sion for our future. | Johannes Wirz, Goetheanum Beekeeping at the Goetheanum The spiritual mission of bees Since the late 1980s, bees have been cared for in a particular way in the Goetheanum's Natural Science Section. The Section created the foundations for a deeper understanding of bees early on, before the public debate: foundations that can help to strengthen the bees.
