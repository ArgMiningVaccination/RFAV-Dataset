But do they tell us how to do a crystal meditation? The actual how-to? I always teach my students, I find the BEST way to make that connection and know what crystal works BEST for YOU is to do your own researching and work with it. One way to work with your crystals is by regularly meditating with them; we'll get to exactly how I like to do that in a bit... Don't say \"I can't meditate\" You just need practice, the right guidance, and a crystal to get the most out of this practice and I've got some guidance for you today that anyone can use to get started.... Even if you \"can't meditate\"! The ripple effects of meditating extend out into many important areas of my day and life \u2014 we'll get to that. Just promise me you'll give it 30 days... Even if you hate it and think it's not working, trust me it is. Just like a muscle gets stronger, your meditation muscle is indeed strengthening. Don't back off. Make this promise to yourself. After you've given it 30 days, if it didn't work for you then you get to go around saying \"I can't meditate\" but not unless you've given it a good college try! I've been working and meditating with crystals for many years now so I have some wisdom to share as far as what works for me and for the many students I have taught over the years. Benefits of Doing the Crystal Work After working with a stone, you'll get to know not only its unique physical characteristics (I know some of my crystals so well that I can pick it out of a bowl of dozens easily) but you'll also have a better understanding of the specific vibrational frequencies it resonates best with you. You'll create a special bond with that mineral while they encourage us to sit and listen to what other realms have to say without all the usual distractions of everyday life. I have about a 1/2 dozen stones that I work with most often and that I've enjoyed getting to \"know\" their energy... and they've gotten to \"know\" mine in a resonant electromagnetic field kind of way. What crystal meditations do for me is that they quiet my mind so that we can tap into my higher self as well as open up the channels to allow that crystal to communicate what it has to share with me. I end up having a special connection with those pieces that I don't have with others because I haven't worked on developing it. It's really cool stuff! By doing this work, you also get some great side benefits: you'll get to hone your meditation skills and cultivate a regular meditation practice. You know... that thing your Dr.'s been telling you to do. Health Benefits of Crystal Meditation Yeah, yeah... you've heard it before, but let me tell you again because enough people aren't doing it: Practicing regular meditation greatly impacts your health... I'm sure you already know that the health benefits of meditation are endless. But one of the most important scientific benefits is how it releases stress. (This is just icing on the cake to the spiritual benefits we're receiving!) It will free you up from anxiety, worry + stress. Who doesn't want to be more happy, calm, and relaxed? Adding the crystals into this practice totally amplifies this effect, especially if you use [crystals more aligned with calming](https://hibiscusmoon.com/fear-and-anxiety/): [rose quartz](https://hibiscusmoon.com/rose-quartz/), blue lace agate, [lepidolite](https://hibiscusmoon.com/color-year-2014/), etc. Additionally, crystals make focused meditation easier by giving you a tangible focus object to center you and keep you in-the-moment. Think of this daily practice as your spiritual nourishment; substances necessary for growth, good health, and evolution. I've got a simple 5 step guide below, BUT FIRST...
