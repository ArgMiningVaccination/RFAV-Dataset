Our unique technology treats the anaerobic digester gas so that the fuel cell plant can run directly off of it. As a result, the system efficiently produces renewable energy from direct biogas. On-site power can improve a facility's energy resiliency. Through our long-term service agreements, FuelCell Energy's technicians can assist with installation, operation, maintenance, and 24/7 remote monitoring. The fuel cell plant uses an electrochemical reaction, rather than combustion, and can improve local air quality by eliminating the need to flare biogas. The clean emissions profile can help a site avoid current and future air permitting challenges. Watch this timelapse of the flare turning off at the Tulare, California wastewater treatment plant. FuelCell Energy is now capturing the excess biogas to use as renewable fuel. 16000 + the number of wastewater treatment plants in the United States. EPA 11400 tons of CO2 emissions avoided each year by the FuelCell Energy plant in Tulare. FuelCell Energy 3 % of the total U.S. electricity production is used by wastewater and water treatment. EPA 2000 cars off the road for a year is equal to the emissions reduction of FuelCell Energy's Tulare plant. EPA: GHG Calculator FuelCell Energy's team is here to support you every step of the way.
