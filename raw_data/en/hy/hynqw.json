The mean monthly number of extended work shifts that were reported was 3.9 \u00b1 3.4, with an average duration of 32.0 \u00b1 3.7 hours.

Descriptive Statistics (their use here is descriptive, & to show comparison is \"fair\") Background: Approximately 20 percent of adults become infected with HPV-16. Although most infections are benign, some progress to anogenital cancer. A vaccine that reduces the incidence of HPV-16 infection may provide important public health benefits. Methods: In this double-blind study, we randomly assigned 2392 females* 16 to 23 years of age) to receive three doses of placebo or HPV-16 virus-like-particle vaccine (40 \u00b5g per dose), given at day 0, month 2, and month 6. Genital samples to test for HPV-16 DNA were obtained at enrollment, one mo. after the third vaccination, and every six mo. thereafter. Women were referred for colposcopy according to a protocol. Biopsy tissue was evaluated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and analyzed for HPV-16 DNA with use of the polymerase chain reaction. The primary end point was persistent HPV-16 infection, defined as the detection of HPV-16 DNA in samples obtained at two or more visits. The primary analysis was limited to women who were negative for HPV-16 DNA and HPV-16 antibodies at enrollment and HPV-16 DNA at month 7. * recruited through advertisements on US college campuses and surrounding communities. Not pregnant, reported no prior abnormal Papanicolaou smears, and reported that they had had no more than five male sex partners during their lifetime. Virgins were enrolled if they were seeking contraception. At enrollment, the women provided written informed consent. The institutional review board at each center approved the protocol. Compensation for subjects was determined independently at each center; amounts ranged from $20 to $225 per visit. 7 Intra-Individual Variation (helps to assess if \"response\" in individual is genuine /artifact) Sources - (short-term) biological variation - measurement errors Describe amount of variation using.. - Standard Deviation (SD) - Coefficient of Variation (c.v.): SD as % of mean - InterQuatile Range (ie Q1 to Q3) - etc. 8 2. Sampling Variation (prelude to Confidence Intervals) oEstimate based on sample Estimate based on 'Universe' oCannot 100% guarantee it, but there is a greater chance of a smaller \"error\" if use larger sample. Can quantify the chances of being \"off target\" by various amounts. oNote: If instrument is faulty, estimate based on 'Universe' may not be correct either: e.g., when measuring % of adult Canadians who are bilingual in both official languages. Non-sampling errors do not diminish in size (probabilistically) even if use very large sample size (even if use a census). 9 Increasing the Margin of Error (i.e., the \"multiple of SE\") increases the probability of hitting the target (including the true value). But \"no free lunch.\" Confidence Interval: OPPOSITE: Different estimates of \"% positive\" in samples (of size 100) from a \"Universe\" in which 61% of individuals are \"positive\" To allow for under/over estimates, we add/subtract a given amount (a Margin of Error, i.e., a multiple of the Standard Error*) to/from the estimate so as to obtain an \"interval estimate\" rather than a \"point-estimate.\" * Standard Error = SE = SD / n inversely proportional to sample size; * directly proportional to individual-to-individual variability. Of course, in real life, we only get to observe 1 sample, but knowing the statistical behaviour of the procedure gives us a certain amount of faith in the interval estimate (\"Confidence\" Interval) 1.64 a 59 pour cent des n'accomplissent pas un travail efficace dans ce 30 pour cent se d\u00e9clarent de l'avis contraire et que onze pour cent ne formulent aucune La question a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9 par Gallup \u00e016 reprises entre 1973 et 1990, et ne n'est qu'une seule fois, en 1973, que la proportion insatisfaits cent.

La marge d'erreur est plus forte pour les r\u00e9gions, par suite de l'importance moidre de l'\u00e9chantillonnage; par exemple, les 272 interviews effectu\u00e9es ont engendr\u00e9 une marge d'erreur de 6 p.c. dans 19 cas sur 20. \"39% OF CANADIANS SMOKED IN PAST WEEK: GALLUP POLL The Gazette, Montreal,, June 27, 1 9 8 5 Results are based on 1,047 personal, in-home interviews with adults, 18 years and over, conducted between May 9 and 11. A sample of this size is accurate within a 4-percentage-point margin, 19 in 20 times. The \"Margin of Error blurb\" for news media was introduced (legislated) in the mid 1980's. 11 2. Confidence Interval Definition: Range of values for a parameter (universe), calculated from the point estimate, the sample size and the observed variation b/w individuals in sample. Choice of degree of confidence up to producer/user, but tradeoff between margin of error and the degree confidence. Uses: Not just for a single proportion or mean; also calculable for comparative parameters such as differences (absolute or ratio) in means, proportions (e.g. risks), incidence rates, x-year or median survival, etc Notes: For rate ratios... (1) CI is usually asymmetric: Next example: point estimate: 2.3, lower/upper limits 1.6 & 3.3. 2.3 is 43% higher than 1.6, and 3.3 is 43% higher than 2.3; Often put on log scale CI symmetric around the point estimate. (2) Width of CI determined by numbers of events, not amounts of experience per se. 12 Rate Rate Example of Confidence Interval (CI) for Rate Ratio 13 A Persistent HPV-16 Infection: The per-protocol population included women who received the full regimen of study vaccine and who were seronegative for HPV-16 and negative for HPV-16 DNA on day 0 and negative for HPV-16DNA at month 7 and in any biopsy specimens obtained between day 0 and month 7; who did not engage in sexual intercourse within 48 hours before the day 0 or month 7 visit; who did not receive any nonstudy vaccine within specified time limits relative to vaccination; who did not receive courses of certain oral or parenteral immunosuppressive agents, immune globulin, or blood products; who were not enrolled in another study of an investigational agent; and who had a month 7 visit within the range considered acceptable for determining the month 7 HPV-16 status. B Persistent HPV-16 Infection:( including women with general protocol violations): The population includes women who received the full regimen of study vaccine and who were seronegative for HPV-16 and negative for HPV-16 DNA on day 0 and negative for HPV-16 DNA at month 7 and in any biopsy specimens obtained between day 0 and month 7.

Squares proportional to amount of information in study. Note that Relative Risk is on a log scale. Risk Risk No Effect 15 3. P-Value (basis for statistical significance levels, tests of hypotheses) What it is: A probability, calculated under a \"Null Hypothesis\" assumption, i.e., assuming that the only factor operating is sampling variation. Use: To assess the evidence provided by sample data in relation to a pre-specified claim or 'hypothesis' concerning some parameter(s) or data-generating process. As with a confidence interval, it makes use of the concept of a sampling distribution. Examples: ... 16 \"Null\" Hypothesis She cannot tell (just guessing) \"Alternative\" Hypothesis She can tell Any Other Hypotheses ??? 17 Example 2 Medical students' compliance with simple administrative tasks and success in final examinations: retrospective cohort study. [BMJ 2002;324:1554-5] Medical students at the University of Sheffield are asked to provide a recent passport photograph at the start of their paediatric module. The pictures are collated, photocopied, and distributed to the wards, teachers, and hospitals within the paediatric programme. This makes identification easier and facilitates pastoral support and assessment. We studied whether students who were unable to comply with simple administrative tasks\u2014for example, supplying a photograph\u2014were more likely to struggle and subsequently to fail their end of year examinations. All students received a written and a verbal request for a photograph at registration for the module. In the introductory week, verbal reminders were given twice, and a list of those who had not supplied a photograph was displayed on a notice board, downstairs from the venue for the introductory course, on which the week's timetable is also posted. A photograph booth was situated in the students' union building, about 120 metres away from the venue for the introductory week. In 1998 and 1999, a total of 393 students started their paediatric module. Passing the final examinations at the end of the year is prerequisite to entering the final year of the course. We checked whether or not a photograph had been provided by the end of the introductory week against the pass and fail lists. A total of 366 (93%) students handed in photographs, and of these 29 (8%, 95% confidence interval 6% to 11%) failed or were disqualified from sitting the examination at the first attempt because they did not satisfactorily complete the clinical component of the course. Of the 27 students who failed to provide a photograph, 13 (48%, 29% to 67%; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test) failed the end of year examinations. Outcome Handed In Photo Did Not Hand In Photo Total Passed 337 14 351 Failed 29 ( 8%) 13 ( 48%) 42 ( 11%) TOTAL 366 27 393 18 P-Value = Probability, IF NO RELATIONSHIP, that 13 or more of the 42 failures would be among the 27 Non-Compliers P-Value = 2.5 x 10-07 P-Value (In General) = Probability of observing this much, or more, evidence against the Null Hypothesis, IF IN FACT THE NULL HYPOTHESIS IS TRUE. 19 Example 3: Vaccine Study P-Value = the Probability, CALCULATED UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP (IN THE LARGER UNIVERSE), that NONE of the 41 persistent infections would be among the (50%) who were vaccinated P-Value = (1/2)41 (1-sided) 20 Example 4 Do infant formula samples shorten the duration of breastfeeding? Bergevin Y, Dougherty C, Kramer MS. Lancet. 1983 May 21;1(8334):1148-51. Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) which withheld free formula samples [given by baby-food companies to breast-feeding mothers leaving hospital with their infants] from a random half of those studied. At 1 month Mothers given sample Mothers not given sample Total Still breast feeding 175 (77%) 182 (84%) 357 (80.4%) Not breast feeding 52 35 87 TOTAL 227 217 444 P=0.07. So, difference is \"Not Statistically Significant\" at 0.05 level. NO MATTER WHETHER THE P-VALUE IS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT OR NOT, ALWAYS LOOK AT THE LOCATION AND WIDTH OF THE CONFIDENCE INTERVAL. IT GIVES YOU A BETTER AND MORE COMPLETE INDICATION OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECT AND OF THE PRECISION WITH WHICH IT WAS MEASURED. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN INCONCLUSIVE NEGATIVE STUDY <--- 95%CI 21 EXAMPLE 5: a \"Definitive\" Negative Study Starch blockers -- their effect on calorie absorption from a high-starch meal. Bo-Linn GW. et al New England Journal of Medicine. 307(23):1413-6, 1982 Dec 2 Abstract: It has been known for more than 25 years that certain plant foods, such as kidney beans and wheat, contain a substance that inhibits the activity of salivary and pancreatic amylase. More recently, this antiamylase has been purified and marketed for use in weight control under the generic name \"starch blockers.\" Although this approach to weight control is highly popular, it has never been shown whether starch-blocker tablets actually reduce the absorption of calories from starch. . Using a one-day calorie-balance technique and a high starch (100 g) meal (spaghetti, tomato sauce, and bread), we measured the excretion of fecal calories after normal subjects had taken either placebo or starch-blocker tablets. If the starch-blocker tablets had prevented the digestion of starch, fecal calorie excretion should have increased by 400 kcal. However, fecal calorie excretion was the same on the two test days (mean \u00b1 S.E.M., 80 \u00b1 4 as compared with 78 \u00b1 2). We conclude that starch blocker tablets do not inhibit the digestion and absorption of starch calories in human beings. Crossover Study : Randomize Placebo ---> Active Tx Active Tx ---> Placebo R R 22 23 SUMMARY Descriptive statistics should be descriptive. Confidence intervals are preferable to P-values, since they are expressed in terms of the (comparative) parameter of interest; they allow us to judge magnitude, and see if certain parameter values are ruled in / out. A statistically significant differences does not necessarily imply a clinically important difference. A 'not-statistically-significant' difference does not necessarily imply that we have ruled out a clinically important difference. Ultimately, P-values, CI's and other evidence from a study need to be combined with other information bearing on the parameter or process. We should not treat any one study as the last word on the topic. We need to worry about distortions of a non-sampling kind that are not minimized by having "}
