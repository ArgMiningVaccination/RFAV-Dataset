Q & A5This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org A COVID -19 Vaccine for Young Children is Here 628 million 5 -11-year -old children are now eligible to get vaccinated. The CDC endorsed the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for kids between 5 -11 after an advisory committee voted 14 -0 to recommend the shots based on clinical trials in this age group. The move comes after the FDA granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the vaccine concluding that its benefits outweigh the risks in kids during the pandemic. The FDA oversees studies to determine whether a vaccine is safe and effective, and the CDC decides on policy: who would benefit from the vaccine and should get vaccinated.This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org COVID -19 Risk for Children The virus has not spared little kids: As of October 28, 2021 , 6.4 million American children tested positive for COVID - 19, representing 16.6% of all cases. (AAP) 8,300 Children have been hospitalized with COVID. 172 children in the 5 -11 age group have died. (This number has increased to 191 as of Nov. 14th2021) COVID -19 was the number 6 leading cause of death for children last month. More than 5,200 children and teens developed MIS -C, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (affecting the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eye, and GI) that often leads to ICU admission due to COVID -19. The median age is 9 years. Hard to predict which kids will develop severe COVID or MIS -C: 30% of kids hospitalized had no underlying health conditions. Black, Native American, and Hispanic children were 3x more likely to be hospitalized than white children (CDC).7This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org COVID -19 Risk for Children (cont'd) While severe illness and death from COVID -19 is far more rare in children than adults, it does happen. With vaccination, such tragedies are much less likely. Unvaccinated teens hospitalized at 10x the rate of vaccinated. The AAP recommends all 5 -11 to get vaccinated. Pediatricians urge parents not to wait: \"You cannot predict in a normal healthy child who is going to get very sick and who is not. Vaccinating is the best way to protect your child against getting severe COVID illness.\" A young child being vaccinated can also decrease the chances of their transmitting disease to more vulnerable family members. Transmission increases the chances that the virus will mutate and acquire dangerous properties. 8This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org The COVID -19 Vaccine Approved for Children: The Details 9Children are not little adults. They are smaller and their immune systems function differently (BETTER) 5-11-year -olds are authorized to receive the Pfizer/ BioNTech COVID -19 pediatric vaccine. It's given at a lower dose than the adult version: Pfizer found that a 10 - microgram dose for 5 -11-year -olds generated a strong immune response and few side effects. (The pediatric dose is 1/3 of the 30 -mcg dose for 12+) It uses smaller needles specifically designed for children's comfort. Like for adults, it is a 2 -dose vaccine protocol with children receiving their second shot 3 weeks after their first. Children are considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks after they receive the second dose. This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org How Do Vaccines Work? 10 A vaccine trains the immune system to recognize and fight viruses or bacteria. To do this, certain molecules from the virus/bacteria must be introduced into the body to trigger an immune response. These molecules are called antigens. By injecting these antigens into the body, the immune system can safely learn to recognize them as hostile invaders, produce antibodies which fight antigens, and remember them for the future. If the bacteria or virus reappears, the immune system will recognize the antigen immediately and attack it.This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org 11Pfizer is an mRNA Vaccine This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org Herd Immunity Vaccines don't just work on an individual level; they protect entire populations. Once enough people are immunized, opportunities for an outbreak of disease become so low even people who aren't immunized benefit. Bacteria or viruses simply won't have enough eligible hosts to establish a foothold and will eventually die out entirely. This phenomenon is called \"Herd immunity\" or \"community immunity\" and it has allowed once devastating diseases to be eliminated entirely, without needing to vaccinate every individual. This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org Clinical Studies with Young Children: to test safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy The vaccine benefit was tested on 4,600 children in this 5 -11 yrage group, and it was 91% effective in generating antibodies and protective against getting COVID (which is a very strong response for any vaccine). The children had similar or fewer side effects than teens and adults. Most common: pain at the injection site, low grade fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle ache resolving in 2 -3 days. Myocarditis, the most serious side effect associated with the vaccine is extremely rare (prevalence rate of .00001) and was not seen in this age group. (It is most prevalent in teenage boys and young men, with no fatalities.) We will discuss this more later on in the presentation. 13This information accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org The COVID -19 Vaccine was found to have 91% efficacy in children ages 5 -11. What does this mean? 14This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm EST ** In the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine trial in 5 -11 yo, the finding of 91% efficacy means that: of 1,000 vaccinated children, 9 were infected and of 1,000 unvaccinated children, 100 were infected. The vaccine protected 91 children from getting infected.cham.org Demographics of the COVID -19 Vaccine study population, 5 -11y N= 2268 20% Hispanic, 6% Black Mean age -8.2 present in 20.6% of -Congenital heart disease15cham.org Vaccine Contraindications The Vaccine is not recommended for people who are severely allergic to any vaccine ingredient or who had an allergic reaction to the first dose. The only ingredient in the vaccine found to elicit allergic reactions is polyethylene glycol. This is the main ingredient in Miralax (which many children are given for constipation). If your child has had no issues with Miralax , it is highly unlikely that your child will have an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The full list of ingredients can be found on the CDC website and is on the next slide. 16This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org 17 This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org Wait a minute \u2014What about other contraindications for vaccination??? None of these conditions are contraindications. In fact, each of these conditions increase the risk of severe disease from COVID -19 and therefore their presence strengthens the recommendation for COVID -19 vaccination. 18What about children with?

Among people with COVID, those with ASD, ID , LD, ADHD and other DD had 3 -9x higher likelihood of hospitalization than those without these conditions and stayed longer. The odds of mortality in the setting of COVID was 6x higher among patients who had an I/DD.This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org There's more...2 \"People with disabilities have been differentially affected by COVID -19 because of three factors: the increased risk of poor outcomes from the disease itself, reduced access to routine health care and rehabilitation, and the adverse social impacts of efforts to mitigate the pandemic.\" This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY This Photo by Unkwn Author is licensed under CC BY -NC-ND This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org The Elephant in the Developmental Disability Clinic: Parents of children with Autism and DD tend to be more Vaccine Hesitant 22 Children with Autism and/or DD and their siblings have lower vaccination rates than other children. Their parents also have more vaccine hesitancy. Why?This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org There is a long history of concern that vaccines caused Autism and other Developmental Disabilities -DISPROVEN For the majority of children with Autism, the cause is unknown. That is a ripe scenario for postulating potential causes. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield, a British gastroenterologist claimed that he had found the cause of autism: the MMR vaccine. He reported data on 11 children with \"regressive autism\". He hypothesized a connection between the vaccine, the onset of autism symptoms, and a particular finding on endoscopy. 23This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org BUT other researchers could notreplicate these findings 24This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org 25 This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org To Be Clear: Vaccines don't cause Autism or DD (and COVID -19 Vaccination does not present particular risk to these children) Repeated studies do not support a relationship between the Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine and Autism Or Thimerisol and Autism -Taylor, B, et al.

Internal Medicine, 2019 26This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org Question & Answer 1) Question: What's the Difference Between FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EAU) and FDA Approval ? Answer: During a public health emergency, the FDA can issue an EUA to allow use of a vaccine before they are officially licensed so that they can be used sooner. Certain criteria must be met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives and that evidence strongly suggests any benefits outweigh any risks to patients. Vaccines issued an EAU must go through the same clinical trials as all other licensed vaccines. To support approval and licensure of a vaccine, the FDA generally requires at least 6 months of safety follow -up for serious and other medically attended adverse effects. 27 This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org 2) Question: Are the vaccines safe to take since they were developed so quickly? Answer: YES. It's the same process that has been used for previous vaccines. Built on years of research on related coronaviruses, including research on vaccines for other coronaviruses. Substantial funding allowed multiple trials to be run in parallel. Funding allowed companies to begin manufacturing vaccines early, enabling immediate distribution upon approval. Safety was monitored closely during every phase of development. Tens of thousands of clinical trial participants received vaccines safely. Federal government, state, and local health departments, and health care providers have spent months planning for storage, distribution, supplies, and other logistics. This is one of the most highly scrutinized vaccines in history 28Question & Answer This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org 3) Question: Will any of the COVID -19 vaccines give me COVID -19? Answer : NO. None of the 3 vaccines contain a live (corona) virus and thus does not carry the risk of causing disease in the vaccinated person. 4) Question: Will any of the COVID -19 vaccines alter a person's DNA? Answer: NO. The way the vaccines work will not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. 5) Question: Can the COVID -19 Vaccine be administered with other vaccines? Answer: COVID -19 vaccines and other vaccines may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID -19 vaccines and other vaccines on the same day, as well as coadministration within 14 days. 29Question & Answer This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org 6) Question: After getting a COVID -19 vaccine, will I test positive for COVID -19 on a viral test? Answer: NO. None of the recommended COVID -19 vaccines cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a current infection. If your body develops an immune response to vaccination, which is the goal, you may test positive on some antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate you had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. 7) Question: If I already had COVID -19, should I still get the COVID -19 vaccine ? Answer: YES. It's not known how long natural immunity (immunity due to an infection) lasts as reinfections can occur. 30Question & Answer This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org 8) Question: Does the vaccine effect future fertility/having a healthy baby one day? Answer: NO. If you are trying to become pregnant now or want to get pregnant in the future, you may get a COVID -19 vaccine. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \"Recommends vaccination for all eligible people who may consider future pregnancy.\" 9) Question: Do we know how long the vaccine offers protection against COVID -19? Answer: NO. Further studies are ongoing. 31Question & Answer This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm ESTcham.org Overall, risk of myocarditis following vaccination remains rare, with just 877 cases confirmed in people under 30, among some 86 million doses of mRNA vaccines given in the U.S., according to the CDC. That would mean the prevalence rate overall is .00001. Myocarditis, the most serious side effect associated with the vaccine is extremely rare and was not seen in this age group. (It is most prevalent in teenage boys and young men, with no fatalities.) Signs include: acute chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations within a few days of the 2nd>1stvaccine Among all age groups, patients with COVID -19 had nearly a 16 times risk for myocarditis compared to patients who did not have COVID -19, and risk varied by sex and age. 32Question & Answer This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm EST 10) Question: Will my child get myocarditis from the COVID -19 Vaccine? cham.org 33Question & Answer This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm EST 10) Question: Will my child Does my child really need the vaccine? 34Question & Answer This information is accurate as of Nov. 17th2021 at 7pm EST Answer: Yes. 191 children aged 5 -11 have died due to COVID -19 since January 21st, 2020 per the CDC (approx. 104 children a year). This estimated annual average is comparable to other vaccine preventable diseases such as Mumps, Rubella, and Tetanus where vaccines are recommended for children. So, it makes sense that we would also want to vaccinate for COVID -19. cham.org The Rose F. Kennedy Children's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center (RFK CERC) at CHAM offered two COVID -19 Vaccine Pop -Up Clinics! RFK CERC was excited to provide our patients with Autism (ASD) and other Developmental Disabilities (DD) (ages 12+) with the opportunity to get vaccinated at two pop up clinics on June 25th, 2021, and July 16th, 2021. The clinic offered our patients and their families the Pfizer vaccine in a familiar setting with support from staff (OTs, Dental Fellows, DB Peds ) who provided behavioral, sensory, and relaxation strategies to successfully and non-traumatically vaccinate atotal of 34 patients many of whom had been unable to be vaccinated in other settings!
