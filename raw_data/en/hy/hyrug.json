Meditaion is part of the eco3spa Exotic Collection. Aromatherapy is the practice of using volatile plant oils (essential oils) for psychological and physical well-being. Essential oils are not the same as perfume or fragrance oils. Essential oils are derived from the actual plants after which they are named. They usually smell very strongly and can offer significant, proven, therapeutic benefit. Perfume oils are artificially created fragrances and so they do not offer the therapeutic benefits that essential oils offer. Aromatherapy crystals provide a natural remedy for aches and pains; nutrients for overworked and tense muscles and relaxants for stress. eco3spa completely natural hot tub aromatherapy salts are made from Dead Sea salts and a minimum of 1% pure essential oils. The large crystals are slow dissolving to give a long lasting effect in the tub. For the ultimate spa experience pour in eco3spa aromatherapy crystals to the desired aroma level (usually approximately 40g per 500 litres of hot tub water), lie back and relax. Completely natural and ideal for use with any sanitiser.
