For that reason we recommend regular \"check-ups\", also called EPSDT visits (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment) for every child. These visits are an important time to assess your child's physical and nutritional status, as well as their intellectual and emotional development. We also share the latest recommendations about child health with you during these visits. Checkups can double as a sports physical, and we are happy to fill out sports and camp participation forms during these visits. We conveniently have a separate waiting area for newborns and for children here for check-ups. Immunizations have had a profound impact on child health, making deadly diseases such as sepsis and bacterial meningitis almost a thing of the past in countries where vaccines are routinely given. We take very seriously our responsibility to keep your child's immunizations up to date. Our nurses are trained to administer vaccines safely and conscientiously. It is the policy of MMC Pediatrics for all patients to be immunized following the recommendations given by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Center for Disease Control. Our pediatricians are experts in the care of sick children. We are trained to gently assess, diagnose, and treat infants, children, and adolescents in accordance with the latest recommendations. Should testing be necessary, MMC has an excellent clinical laboratory and radiology department conveniently located down the hall. Being part of the MMC family means that specialty care is available in our building, and can often be consulted on the same day in urgent situations. "}
