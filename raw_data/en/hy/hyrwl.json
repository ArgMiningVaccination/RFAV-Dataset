By utilizing a phone app for this initial consultation, you have greater control over your time and selection. Whether the appointment is for you or a child, you can use the time to ensure that the dentist is the best fit for your needs. By using NM, doctors have higher chances of early detection of diseases and heath conditions which increase the percentage of healing (5 Advantages and Disadvantages of Nuclear Medicine, 2016). Hip joint effusion is a buildup of fluid in the hip joint. The hip joint is where the upper leg bone (femur) attaches to the hip bone (pelvic bone). The hip joint is a closed space. The lining of the hip joint (synovium) makes a lubricating fluid. This helps the top of the femur move easily in its socket in the pelvic bone. Radiologists are constantly learning, growing and facing new challenges each second of the day. Radiologists use medical imaging to look at the inside of people's bodies to diagnose them. \"Radiologists are physicians who performs and interprets diagnostic imaging tests and interventional procedures or treatments that involve the use of X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging equipment\" (Tanja). They preform image-guided procedures, but they are not responsible for other medical needs of the patients being treated. They deal less with interaction with patients and more with other health care professionals (Tanja). Becoming a radiologist is not easy, schooling can take 10 or more years. 4 years of undergraduate school, 4 years of medical Clinical medicine and science are inherently inseparable entities. Scientific advances and discoveries will perpetually influence any career in the medical profession. This was an idea I learned early on during my undergraduate education. However, my own interest in science spans further than using it as a means to an end. The process of developing theories and conducting experiments enthralls me. I not only strive to apply scientific findings to treat my future patients, but also hope to gain inspiration from my patients to advance scientific knowledge. I believe the ideal way to apply my interests, and to best serve my community, is as a physician-scientist. The MD Anderson 1st Year Medical Student Program would offer me the opportunities Medical error is one of the most preventable adverse effects of care that is harmful to the patient, with radiology attributing for a significant percentage. Medical errors can happen in a health system when a patient is given inaccurate or complete diagnosis that might lead to injury, disease, infection, and even death of the patient. There are many causes for medical errors such as, miscommunication between the treating provider and the patient, having surgery at the wrong site, wrong interpretation of imaging studies, medication side effects, and nonsomical infections. Radiolabel can be called radiotracer marker or radioactive pharmaceutical agent which is commonly used in therapeutic or diagnostic purpose. Radiolabel applied on white blood cell has different procedure and precautions as well as different diagnostic area in hospital. Radiolabel which applied in clinical practice is on certain type of cells which are red blood cell, white blood cell and platelet. The radioactive agent commonly used to radiolabel the white blood cell include 99mTc -HMPAO and 111In-oxine. Comparison of three alternative bolus materials to Superflab in providing the maximum dose buildup (Dmax) Dental radiographs are important tools in the diagnosis of oral diseases. It helps the dentist to employ appropriate treatment regimen for patient's dental conditions, and plays a continual important role in dental practice. Radiation dosage from such dental radiographs are low and are thought to present minimal risk (Enabulele & Igbinedion, 2013) Neuropsychology is a field with historical origins in both psychology and neurology. The crucial activity of neuropsychologists is to assess the brain functioning, through prearranged and organized behavioral observation. Twenty years ago energy sources were limited, so, throughout the years the engineers tried to solve this problem in creative ways. They had electricity, solar energy and other sources of energy but, these kinds of energy had more disadvantages than the advantages. Humans cannot go forward in life without energy. However, in the past few years they discovered nuclear energy like solar energy and nuclear energy. These energy sources supply us with the energy we need to run everything around us. Nowadays engineers are looking for the perfect way to create energy. It must be clean, safe, controlled and functional energy source. We can use solar energy ore wend energy, but it can not be controlled due to motor problems. However, in this essay Isotopes are atoms that contain the same number of protons but have different numbers of neutrons (What is Isotope). These isotopes contain similar chemical properties but have different physical properties due to their atomic mass. Or in other words, isotopes have the same atomic number but differ in mass (What is an Isotope). \"There are 90 naturally occurring elements with roughly 250 stable isotopes, and over 3200 unstable or radioactive isotopes\" (Why are Isotopes Important). A stable isotope is an isotope that has a stable nucleus and does not give out radiation while an unstable isotope or also known as a radioactive isotope is an isotope that contains an unstable nucleus and gives out radiation (Isotope Stability). These isotopes have their own properties where each are different and are used differently in many scientific applications such as, detectors that help to prevent nuclear Radiometer has started under the Danaher's direction, an intensive program of process improvements through the use of the Danaher Business System (DBS), a constant tool system and company culture that concentrates to continuously improve the company's growth, leadership capabilities and lean principles. Furthermore, Danaher has its philosophy focused on Lean, which implies that Radiometer needs to have described processes in order to deliver the same consistent output and to be able to control it and change it, when needed (Wells and Danskin, 2014) Positron Emission Tomography or 'PET' is a type of scan that examines the shape, size and behavior of the organs in your body. Created by a physicist and scientist named Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, he designed and produced Radiography in 1896, it used something called x-rays, which is an invisible radiation, which is also discovered by him. Then this type of Forensic imaging, particularly MRI technology is crucial in determining the cause of death in forensic pathology. There are a few main techniques for forensic imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT), and conventional radiography. The PMCT is generally used for gunshot wounds, detection of gas embolism, trauma cases, and changes in the skeletal system. Some advantages of this technique are that it is fast, easy to handle, good three-dimensional reconstruction, excellent visuals of the skeletal system and gases in the body. However, it is not without disadvantages like how it uses radiation, meaning companies must protect their employees, it has limited data storage, limited visualization of soft tissue and employees must go through extensive training to be authorized to operate it.
