Parkview Health offers the Parkview Health Employee Benefit Plan to assist you in payment of expenses for medically necessary care and treatment resulting from an illness or accident. The Plan can also help you stay healthy by covering certain costs of preventive care such as physical examinations and cancer screening tests. This benefits guide will help you better understand your healthcare plan options and make decisions that will best suit your needs. Parkview offers one medical plan for eligible full- and part -time co -workers. A dental and vision plan is also offered. Each of the plans is a \"stand alone\" plan meaning that you elect each of the plans that you desire coverage. The plans you elect will be in effect for the entire plan year unless you experience a qualified status change in your work or family situation. The medical, dental and vision plans give you the freedom to choose any provider (doctor or hospital) at the time you need treatment. However, the level of coverage will vary according to your provider choices. Generally, the plan's benefits will be greater if you use a Signature Care network provider. For certain medical services, you will receive an even higher level of benefits if you use a P arkview Health special access provider (facilities and physicians fully or partially owned by PH). If you use a non- network provider (neither a P arkview Health special access provider or a Signature Care network provider), you receive the lowest level of benefits. Am I eligible for healthcare benefits from Parkview Health? Parkview offers medical, dental and vision cover age to eligible coworkers with a 0. 6FTE or greater. When can I Enroll? To enroll in the medical, dental, and/or vision plans or to make changes in your coverage level, you must complete your enrollment within 31 days from your date of hire, status change or qualifying change in family status and provide the Eligibility Docume nts for your Dependents. Y ou will be using \"MyHR\" to enroll for medical, dental, and vision coverage. You can access MyHR at www.myhr.parkview.com from any computer or mobile device with internet access including you own personal computer by using any browser (Internet Explorer must be version 8 or higher. More information about MyHR is included in this booklet.) If you do not make a health plan election within 31 days of initial eli gibility, you must wait until the next annual enrollment period to do so, unless you experience a qualifying event . Whom can I enroll? Parkview Health offers you the opportunity to cover your eligible dependents. Please reference the chart below to understand if your family member is eligible for coverage as a dependent on your health plan. If you enroll your eligible dependents in Parkview's medical, dental, and/or vision plans, you must provide documentation supporting their eligibility for the Plan within 62 days of your date of hire or date of status change. The eligibility documentation that meets your situation should be sent directly to Signature Care. For medical, dental, and vision benefits, you choose from five coverage levels: Co-worker only Co-worker & Spouse Co-worker & 1 child Co-worker & 2 or more children Family Family member Eligibility Requirements Acceptable Documentation Spouse Must be legally married . Must not be offered employer sponsored health coverage elsewhere - for medical coverage only . See \"Working Spouse Rule\" below for more detail Marriage license or certificate Children Under age 26, regardless of their educational, marital, residential or work status Biological child(ren) Other qualified child(ren), including legally adopted children, child legally placed for an adoption, step- children, or children for whom you have legal court appointed guardianship Birth certificate for each dependent child Adoption papers for each dependent child that is adopted or waiting adoption and is legally placed Court documentation for proof of legal guardianship for dependent children Divorce decree indicating which spouse pays healthcare expenses for dependent children 7 WORKING SPOUSE RULE : Parkview has adopted a Working Spouse Rule. Working Spouse Rule means that i f your spouse is employed and their employer provides medical coverage, even as a retiree, you are not able to provide medical plan coverage for your spouse if they are eligible for their employer's coverage. Please note that Parkview considers certain non-traditional medical coverage options, including but not limited to individual coverage health reimbursement arrangements (also called ICHRAs), offered by other employer s to qualify as \"medical coverage\" available through that employer for purposes of applying the Working Spouse Rule criteria. It is your responsibility to ensure that medical plan coverage is accurate as Parkview Health trusts their co- workers to only cov er their spouse when they meet the eligibility criteria and their spouse is not offered or not eligible for medical coverage with their employer. If any information is later found not to be accurate or your spouse was eligible for coverage with their employer, you may be subject to corrective action up to and including termination of employment. The Working Spouse Rule does not affect your spouse's eligibility for dental and vision insurance as well as the Healthcare and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Acc ounts. For those co- workers who will elect coverage for their spouse, during the enrollment process in MyHR, you will need to attest that your spouse is eligible for coverage. Examples that may help you identify your situation: 1 Your spouse is eligible for retiree coverage through their former employer . As y our spouse has coverage through their employer's medical plan, s econdary coverage is not available under Parkview Health's medical plan. 2 Your spouse does not have medical coverage becaus e their employer does not offer any medical benefits. Your spouse is eligible for Parkview Health's medical plan. 3 Your spouse is not presently employed. Your spouse is eligible for Parkview Health's medical plan. 4 Your spouse is eligible for Medicare coverage. Your spouse is eligible for Parkview Health's medical plan. 5 Your spouse has medical coverage through their employer and wants to use Parkview Health's plan for secondary coverage. Your spouse will need to enroll for their employer's medical coverage. Secondary coverage is not available under Parkview Health's medical plan. 6 Your spouse, who is also employed with Parkview Health , is eligible for medical coverage through Parkview Health and is currently enrolled on your plan. Your Parkview Health employed spouse may continue coverage under your plan. When does my coverage begin? Your benefits will be effective on the first day of the month following your date of hire or date of your qualifying status change, if you enroll within 31 days of the event. If your date of hire or date of your qualifying status change is on the first day of the month, coverage will be ef fective on that day. Annual Open Enrollment elections are effective January 1 of the new plan year. When can I make a change to my benefit coverage? If you experience a qualifying life event, you have 31 days to make a change to your benefit coverage. If you miss this deadline, your next opportunity to change your benefit coverage will be during the next annual open enrollment period. MyHR can be used to change benefits elections due to certain status changes, including marriage, divorce, birt h, adoption/legal guardianship or gain or loss of other coverage. What is considered a qualifying life event? You will not be able to change your health plan coverage during the plan year unless a qualifying event occurs. There are two types of qualifyi ng events : (1) family status changes and (2) employment status changes. See page 11 for more information. When a qualifying life event occurs and you want to make a change in your coverage, you must do so within 31 days of the event. 8 How do I pay for my medical, dental, and vision plans? The applicable premium for the coverage you elect will be withheld on the first paycheck of the month in which your coverage becomes effective. Medical premium rates are provided on page 9. Premiums are deducted pre- tax from your paycheck. As a new hire, how can I take advantage of the discounted medical premium s with the MyWell -Being program ? As a new hire, your medical premiums will be the discounted MyWell -Being rates for 2022 . This allows you to receive the discounted medical rates from the date of hire or when you become benefit eligible. Depending on your hire date, you may have requirements to meet in order to earn the incentive for 2023 plan year. Please watch for emails from the MyWell -Being team for more information. When does my coverage end? Coverage will terminate for the following covered co- workers when these events occur: For a covered co- worker and their dependents : When you end your employment with Parkview Health or are no longer eligible for benefits, coverage will end on the last day of the month in which your employment ends or the change in status occurs as long as requi red contributions have been made. For the spouse of the enrolled co-workers : Coverage will end on the date of divorce, dissolution, or legal separation. For a dependent child : Coverage will end at the end of the month in which the child no longer qualifies as a dependent. .

The maximum monthly benefit for regular, full time co- workers is $5,000. How long will my benefits continue if I am approved for Long Term Disability? If you meet the definition of disability under th is plan and The Hartford approves your claim, LTD payment will start after the 180-day elimination period. (Please note that elimination periods are different for job titles.) Your payments will continue until you are no longer disabled or, if earlier, wh en you reach the maximum payment period, which is generally age 65. 15 Benefits and Costs for the Life Insurance Plans Most people don't like thinking about dying or being seriously injured.

The benefit is expressed as an account balance and grows with Parkview Health contributions and investment returns on those contributions. Your Parkview Health contribution will increase as your years of benefit service increase. What are the eligibility requirements to receive a contribution from this Plan? You automatically enter the Retirement Contribution Plan and begin accruing benefit service on the first day of the month after you meet the following eligibility requirements: Employed or re- employed with Parkview Health on or after January 1, 2005; At least 21 years of age; and Complet ion of 1,000 hours of service within your first 12 months of employment or during any later calendar year.

Generally, you earn a year of vesting service for each calendar year in which you complete at least 1,000 hours of service. Once you are 100% vested, if you leave Parkview's employment, you will have access to this plan following your last day of work . How much is Parkview Health's contribution to the Retirement Contribution Plan? Your contribution is based upon the number of years of Benefit Service you accrue.

Parkview Health offers the opportunity for co- workers with an FTE status of 0.6 or greater to participate in the Healthcare and/or Dependent Care FSAs, also known as Parkflex. A Parkflex Healthcare and/or Dependent Care FSA lets you save on healthcare and dependent/elder care expenses using pre- tax dollars. This is a way to INCREASE your spendable income while loweri ng the amount of taxes you pay. Enrolling in one or both of the available accounts may accomplish this for you. HealthEquity is the administrator for the Parkflex plan. When deciding the amount, you want to contribute, be careful to figure CONSERVATIVELY as you could forfeit any unused amounts. The Healthcare and Dependent Care Accounts are separate Accounts. Funds cannot be transferred from one account to the other. How do Flexible Spending Accounts work? Each paycheck, you set aside some of your pay, before taxes, to use for eligible expenses. This is how you save money: $100 put into your FSA is $100 to spend on eligible expenses. Without an FSA, you pay taxes, leaving $60 or $75 to pay for the same eligible expenses. What are the 202 2 Annual Pl an Maximums? Healthcare Account Maximum Contribution $2, 850 Dependent Care Account Maximum Contribution $5,000 What is my Commitment Period for a Flexible Spending Account? Once you make your election, you are committed to remain in the plan for the entire plan year (January 1 through December 31). You may not change your participation or contribution amounts unless you have a change in status, such as marriage, divorce, death of spouse or dependent, birth or adoption of a child, change f rom part -time to full -time employment for you or your spouse, termination or commencement of spouse's employment, taking unpaid leave of absence by you or your spouse, dependent child enrolled in school, change in dependent care coverage, and change in cos t of dependent care, except when a relative provides the service. You may be required to submit appropriate documentation to verify the event. When you have a status change that alters your coverage needs, you must contact your Human Resources office withi n 31 days of the qualifying event to make the change. Healthcare Flexible Spending Accounts You may protect up to $2, 850 of your pay from taxes by signing up for a Healthcare FSA . This account allows you to set aside money to pay for eligible health expenses such as co- pays, deductibles, and medical supplies. You will be provided with a HealthEquity health care card you can use to draw money from the account at the point of sale. Money set aside in a Healthcare FSA is not subject to federal or state taxes. That means a FSA can save you about $30- $40 on every $100 you spend on eligible expenses. The maximum allowable contribution for a Healthcare FSA is $2, 850. How easy is using your Healthcare Flexible Spending Account? When you elect the Healthcare FSA, your account is funded with the full amount you've chosen for 2022 . Throughout the year, you \"pay your account back\" with pre- tax contributions from your paycheck. Use thes e convenient payment options: HealthEquity Healthcare Visa Card. Use it instead of cash at healthcare providers and wherever accepted for health- related services and health expenses. Pay My Provider . Send payment directly to your healthcare provider. Pay Me Back . File a claim online, by fax or mail for reimbursement. Mobile. Use your mobile application to file a claim from your smartphone. Flexible Spendi ng Account rules allow Parkview to offer a grace period at the end of the plan year for Healthcare FSA only. The grace period provides y ou with more time to use any 202 2 remaining balance as of December 31, 2022. This means you can continue to spend your 2022 unused funds until March 15, 202 3. Any unused amount after Mar ch 15 will be forfeited. All 202 2 claims must be submitted by May 31, 202 3. Any claims filed for 2022 expenses (incurred during the plan year and grace period for the Healthcare FS A ending on March 15, 20 23) must be received (not postmarked) by HealthEquity on or before May 31, 202 3) to qua lify for payment out of your 2022 account. 24 Can a Healthcare FSA Save Me Money?

A Dependent Care FSA works a lot like a healthcare FSA, but your account is funded each payroll period, so funds are available as contributions are taken from your paycheck.

You pay co- insurance plus any deductibles you owe. For example, if the health insurance or plan's allowed amount for an outpatient service is $100 and you've met your deductible, your co- insurance payment of 20 % will be $20. The health insurance or plan pays the rest of the allowed amount. Copayment (copay) A fixed amount (for example, $25) you pay for a covered healthcare service, usually when you receive the service. The amount can vary by the type of covered healthcare service. Deductible The amount you owe for healthcare services covered by your health insurance plan before your health insurance or plan begins to pay. For example, if your deductible is $2,000, you must meet your $ 2,000 deductible before the plan will pay for covered healthcare services subject to the deductible. The deductible may not apply to all services. You must pay a new deductible each year; there is no carryover from one year to the next. Fee schedule The amount the plan determines to be the prevailing charge for a healthcare service. Charges as set forth in the Signature Care contract with a Network Provider or Sponsor. Network provider Physicians and other healthcare providers under contract with Parkview Signature Care to provide services to members at a negotiated rate. An out -of-network provider is not under contract with Signature Care and does not provide a discount. Open Enrollment Open Enrollment is a specific time period in which Parkview Health benefit -eligible co -workers may enroll for medical, d ental and vision coverage as well as other voluntary benefit plans . For the 2022 plan, the enrollment period was November 15 through December 1, 2021 . Out-of-Pocket (OOP) limit for network services The most you pay during a policy period (usually a year) before your health insurance or plan begins to pay 100% of the allowed amount. This limit includes your copayments, deductibles and co- insurance payments. Parkflex healthcare and dependent care flexible spending account The Parkflex account provides a way for you to pay for certain unreimbursed healthcare expenses and dependent (for example, your children) and elder care expenses with pre- tax dollars. Contributions you make to your own Parkflex account are made before income taxes are deducted. 46 Parkview Care Partners Parkview Care Partners (PCP) is Parkview's clinical integration program which facilitates the coordination of patient care across medical conditions, providers, settings and time. The result is patient -centered care that is safe, timely, effective and efficient, meeting or exceeding national quality standards. Select providers have been named under PCP and those specific providers will be considered Special Access. Prior authorization A decision by the P lan that a healthcare service, treatment plan, prescr iption drug or durable medical equipment is medically necessary. Sometimes called prior authorization or precertification. Some services m ay require preauthorization for certain services before you receive them, except in an emergency. Preauthorization isn't a promise your health insurance or plan will cover the cost. For these specific medical services, you must call Parkview Signature Care for prior authorization. Qualified status change A qualified status change refers to those times in which you have a change in your FTE status or family status, such as a change in employment, marriage or birth of a child. Any changes to your coverage level must be done with 31 days of the qualifying event. Signature Care Parkview's group health plan is administered by Parkview's own Health Plan Services. Parkview Signature Care is a statewide network of healthcare providers located throughout Indiana and northwest Ohio that can be accessed through Parkview's group health plan. As a Signature Care member, you receive medical services at a negotiated rate from contracted, preferred providers. The rate is lower than it would be with non- contracted providers. Well-being Well-being is a balance of physical, spiritual, psychol ogical and social elements of who we are. When you take action for balancing all four areas of your life, you can move forward along the path to greater well -being. 47 Appendix 6 Important regulatory notices for active plan participants Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act Annual Notice Do you know that your plan, as required by the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, provides benefits for mastectomy -related services including all stages of reconstruction and surgery to achieve symmetr y between the breasts, prostheses, and complications resulting from a mastectomy, including lymphedema?

Notice of Special Enrollment Rights for Medical Plan Coverage As you know, if you have declined enrollment in Parkview Health's health plan for you or your dependents (including your spouse) because of other health insurance coverage, you or your dependents may be able to enroll in some coverages under this plan without waiting for the next open enrollment period, provided that you request enrollment within 31 days after your or your dependent's other coverage ends (or after the employer stops contributing toward your or your dependents' other coverage). In addition, if you have a new dependent as a result of marriage, birth, adoption or placement for adoption, you may be able to enroll yourself and your eligible dependents, provided that you request enrollment within 31 days after the marriage, birth, adoption or plac ement for adoption. Parkview Health will also allow a special enrollment opportunity if you or your eligible dependents either: Lose Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage because you are no longer eligible, or Become eligible for a state's premium assistance program under Medicaid or CHIP. For these enrollment opportunities, you will have 60 days - instead of 31 - from the date of the Medicaid/CHIP eligibility change to request enrollment in the Parkview Health group health plan. Note that this new 60- day extension doesn't apply to enrollment opportunities other than due to the Medicaid/CHIP eligibility change. Note: If your dependent becomes eligible for a special enrollment right, you may add the dependent to your current coverage. CHIP/Medicaid Notice Premium Assistance Under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) If you or your children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and you're eligible for health coverage from your employer, your state may have a premium assistance program that can help pay for coverage, using funds from their Medicaid or CHIP programs. If you or your children aren't eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, you won't be eligible for these premium assistance programs but you may be able to buy indi vidual insurance coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. For more information, visit www.healthcare.gov . If you or your dependents are already enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office to find out if premium assistance is available. If you or your dependents are NOT currently enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, and you think you or any of your dependents might be eligible for either of these programs, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office or dial 1-877-KIDS NOW or 48 www.insurekidsnow.gov to find out how to apply. If you qualify, ask your state if it has a program that might help you pay the premiums for an employer -sponsored plan. If you or your dependents are eligible for premium assistance under Medica id or CHIP, as well as eligible under your employer plan, your employer must allow you to enroll in your employer plan if you aren't already enrolled. This is called a \"special enrollment\" opportunity, and you must request coverage within 60 days of being determined eligible for premium assistance. If you have questions about enrolling in your employer plan, contact the Department of Labor at www.askebsa.dol.gov or call 1-866-444-EBSA (3272) .

It describes how medical information abo ut you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) imposes numerous requirements on the use and disclosure of individual health information by Parkview Health's health plans. This information, known as protected health information, inc ludes almost all individually identifiable health information held by a plan \u2014 whether received in writing, in an electronic medium, or as an oral communication. This notice describes the privacy practices of the Signature Care Employee Medical and Dental Benefit Plans, Parkflex Healthcare Flexible Spending Account, and any other health plans or programs under the Parkview Health System, Inc. Welfare Benefit Plan that provide medical care benefits and that are either uninsured, or insured and provide PHI to the Parkview Health System, Inc. Welfare Benefit Plan. The plans covered by this notice may share health information with each other to carry out treatment, payment, or health care operations. These plans are collectively referred to as the Plan in this n otice, unless specified otherwise. The Plan's duties with respect to health information about you The Plan is required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information and to provide you with this notice of the Plan's legal duties and privacy practices with respect to your health information. If you participate in an insured plan option, you will receive a notice directly from the Insurer. It's important to note that these rules apply to the Plan, not Parkview Health as an employer or to other emp loyee benefits offered by Parkview Health such as disability plans and family and medical leaves. Different policies apply to other Parkview Health programs or to data unrelated to the Plan. VERMONT - Medicaid WEST VIRGINIA - Medicaid Website: http://www.greenmountaincare.org/ (1 -855-699-8447) VIRGINIA - Medicaid and CHIP WISCONSIN - Medicaid and CHIP Website: https://www.coverva.org/en/famis -800-251-1269 51 How the Plan may use or disclose your health information The pri vacy rules generally allow the use and disclosure of your health information without your permission (known as an authorization) for purposes of health care treatment, payment activities, and health care operations. Here are some examples of what that migh t entail: Treatment includes providing, coordinating, or managing health care by one or more health care providers or doctors. Treatment can also include coordination or management of care between a provider and a third party, and consultation and referrals between providers. For example, the Plan may share your health information with physicians who are treating you. Payment includes activities by this Plan, other plans, or providers to obtain premiums, make coverage determinations, and provide reimbursement for health care. This can include determining eligibility, reviewing services for medical necessity or appropriateness, engaging in utilization management activities, claims management, and billing; as well as performing \"behind the scenes\" plan funct ions, such as risk adjustment, collection, or reinsurance. For example, the Plan may share information about your coverage or the expenses you have incurred with another health plan to coordinate payment of benefits. Health care operations include activities by this Plan (and, in limited circumstances, by other plans or providers), such as wellness and risk assessment programs, quality assessment and improvement activities, customer service, and internal grievance resolution. Health care operations also include de- identifying your health information or creating limited data sets; evaluating vendors; engaging in credentialing, training, and accreditation activities; performing underwriting or premium rating; arranging for medical review and audit activities; and conducting business planning and development. For example, the Plan may use information about your claims to audit the third parties that approve payment for Plan benefits. The amount of health information used, disclosed or requested will be limited to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purposes, as defined under, and where required by, the HIPAA rules. If the Plan uses or discloses PHI for underwriting purposes, the Plan will not use or disclose PHI that is your genetic information for such purposes. How the Plan may share your health information with Parkview Health for plan administration purposes The Plan, or its health insurer, may also disclose your health information without your written authorization to Parkview Health for plan administration purposes. Parkview Health may need your health information to administer benefits under the Plan. Parkview Health agrees not to use or disclose your health information other than as permitted or required by the Plan document s and by law. The Benefits Manager and individuals identified in the Plan's Summary Plan Description including, among others, the privacy officer, legal counsel, committee members and workforce members assisting the Plan are the only Parkview Health co-workers who will have access to your health information for plan administration functions. Here's how additional information may be shared between the Plan and Parkview Health, as allowed under the HIPAA rules: The Plan, or its insurer, may disclose \"summary health information\" to Parkview Health, if requested, for purposes of obtaining premium bids to provide coverage under the Plan or for modifying, amending, or terminating the Plan. Summary health information is information that summarizes particip ants' claims information, from which names and other identifying information have been removed. 52 The Plan, or its insurer, may disclose to Parkview Health information on whether an individual is participating in the Plan or has enrolled or disenrolled in an insurance option offered by the Plan. In addition, you should know that Parkview Health cannot and will not use health information obtained from the Plan for any employment -related actions. However, health information collected by Parkview Health from other sources \u2014 for example, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, or workers' compensation programs \u2014 is not protected under HIPAA (although this type of information may be protected under other federal or state laws). Other allowable uses or disclosures of your health information In certain cases, your health information can be disclosed without authorization to a family member, close friend, or other person you identify who is involved in your care or payment for your c are. Information about your location, general condition, or death may be provided to a similar person (or to a public or private entity authorized to assist in disaster relief effort s). You'll generally be given the chance to agree or object to these discl osures (although exceptions may be made \u2014 for example, if you're not present or if you're incapacitated). In addition, your health information may be disclosed without authorization to your legal representative. The Plan may also participate in organized health care arrangements with certain other covered entities and may use or disclose your information, without authorization, to those entities for health care operations activities of the organized health care arrangement. The Plan also can use or dis close your health information without your written authorization for the following activities: Workers' compensation Disclosures to workers' compensation or similar legal programs that provide benefits for work - related injuries or illness without regard t o fault, as authorized by and necessary to comply with the laws Necessary to prevent serious threat to health or safety Disclosures made in the good -faith belief that releasing your health information is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to public or personal health or safety, if made to someone reasonably able to prevent or lessen the threat (or to the target of the threat); includes disclosures to help law enforcement officials identify or apprehend an individual who has admitted participation in a violent crime that the Plan reasonably believes may have caused serious physical harm to a victim, or where it appears the individual has escaped from prison or from lawful custody Public health activities Disclosures authorize d by law to persons who may be at risk of contracting or spreading a disease or condition; disclosures to public health authorities to prevent or control disease or report child abuse or neglect; and disclosures to the Food and Drug Administration to collect or report adverse events or product defects Victims of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence Disclosures to government authorities, including social services or protected services agencies authorized by law to receive reports of abuse, neglect, or domes tic violence, as required by law or if you agree or the Plan believes that disclosure is necessary to prevent serious harm to you or potential victims (you'll be notified of the Plan's disclosure if informing you won't put you at further risk) 53 Judicial an d administrative proceedings Disclosures in response to a court or administrative order, subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process (the Plan may be required to notify you of the request or receive satisfactory assurance from the party seeking your health information that efforts were made to notify you or to obtain a qualified protective order concerning the information) Law enforcement purposes Disclosures to law enforcement officials required by law or legal process, or to identify a suspect, fugitive, witness, or missing person; disclosures about a crime victim if you agree or if disclosure is necessary for immediate law enforcement activity; disclosures about a death that may have resulted from criminal conduct; and disclosures to pr ovide evidence of criminal conduct on the Plan's premises Decedents Disclosures to a coroner or medical examiner to identify the deceased or determine cause of death; and to funeral directors to carry out their duties Organ, eye, or tissue donation Disclosures to organ procurement organizations or other entities to facilitate organ, eye, or tissue donation and transplantation after death Research purposes Disclosures subject to approval by institutional or private privacy review boards, subject to certain assurances and representations by researchers about the necessity of using your health information and the treatment of the information during a research project Health oversight activities Disclosures to health agencies for activities authorized by la w (audits, inspections, investigations, or licensing actions) for oversight of the health care system, government benefits programs for which health information is relevant to beneficiary eligibility, and compliance with regulatory programs or civil rights laws Specialized government functions Disclosures about individuals who are Armed Forces personnel or foreign military personnel under appropriate military command; disclosures to authorized federal officials for national security or intelligence activities; and disclosures to correctional fac ilities or custodial law enforcement officials about inmates HHS investigations or where required by law Disclosures of your health information to the Department of Health and Human Services to investigate or determine the Plan's compliance with the HIPAA privacy rule or where a use or disclosure is required by law and the use or disclosure complies with and is limited to the relevant requirements of such law Except as described in this notice, other uses and disclosures will be made only with your writt en authorization. For example, in most cases, the Plan will obtain your authorization before it communicates with you about products or programs if the Plan is being paid to make those communications. If we keep psychotherapy notes in our records, we will obtain your authorization in some cases before we release those records. The Plan will never sell your health information unless you have authorized us to do so. You may revoke your authorization as allowed under the HIPAA rules. However, you can't revoke your authorization with respect to disclosures the Plan has already made. The Plan is also required by law to notify you following a breach of your unsecured protected health information. Your individual rights You have the following rights with respect to your health information the Plan maintains. These rights are subject to certain limitations, as discussed below. This section of the notice describes how you may exercise each individual right. 54 Right to request restrictions on certain uses and disclosures of your health information and the Plan's right to refuse You have the right to ask the Plan to restrict the use and disclosure of your health information for treatment, payment, or health care operations, except for uses or disclosures required by law. You have the right to ask the Plan to restrict the us e and d isclosure of your health information to family members, close friends, or other persons you identify as being involved in your care or payment for your care. You also have the right to ask the Plan to restrict use and disclosure of health information to notify those persons of your location, general condition, or death \u2014 or to coordinate those efforts with entities assisting in disaster relief efforts. If you want to exercise this right, your request to the Plan must be in writing and submitted to the Contact below. The Plan is not required to agree to a requested restriction. If the Plan does agree, a restriction may later be terminated by your written request, by agreement between you and the Plan (including an oral agreement), or unilaterally by the Plan for health information created or received after you're notified that the Plan has removed the restrictions. The Plan may also disclose health information about you if you need emergency treatment, even if the Plan has agreed to a restriction. An entity covered by these HIPAA rules (such as your health care provider) or its business associate must comply with your request that health information regarding a specific health care item or service not be disclosed to the Plan for purposes of payment or health care operations if you have paid out of pocket and in full for the item or service. Right to receive confidential communications of your health information If you think that disclosure of your health information by the usual means could endanger you in s ome way, the Plan will accommodate reasonable requests to receive communications of health information from the Plan by alternative means or at alternative locations. If you want to exercise this right, your request to the Plan must be in writing, submitt ed to the Contact below, and you must include a statement that disclosure of all or part of the information could endanger you. Right to inspect and copy your health information With certain exceptions, you have the right to inspect or obtain a copy of your health information in a \"designated record set.\" This may include enrollment, payment, claims adjudication, and case or medical management record systems maintained by the Plan; or a group of records the Plan uses to make decisions about individuals. Ho wever, you do not have a right to inspect or obtain copies of psychotherapy notes or information compiled for civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings. The Plan may deny your right to access, although in certain circumstances, you may request a review of the denial. If you want to exercise this right, your request to the Plan must be in writing and submitted to the Contact below. Within 30 days of receipt of your request (60 days if the health information is not accessible on site), the Plan will pro vide you with one of these responses: The access or copies you requested A written denial that explains why your request was denied and any rights you may have to have the denial reviewed or file a complaint A written statement that the time period for rev iewing your request will be extended for no more than 30 more days, along with the reasons for the delay and the date by which the Plan expects to address your request 55 You may also request your health information be sent to another entity or person, so lon g as that request is clear, conspicuous and specific. The Plan may provide you with a summary or explanation of the information instead of access to or copies of your health information, if you agree in advance and pay any applicable fees. The Plan also may charge reasonable fees for copies or postage. If the Plan doesn't maintain the health information but knows where it is maintained, you will be informed where to direct your request. If the Plan keeps your records in an electronic format, you may reques t an electronic copy of your health information in a form and format readily producible by the Plan. You may also request that such electronic health information be sent to another entity or person, so long as that request is clear, conspicuous, and specif ic. Any charge that is assessed to you for these copies must be reasonable and based on the Plan's cost. Right to amend your health information that is inaccurate or incomplete With certain exceptions, you have a right to request that the Plan amend your health information in a designated record set. The Plan may deny your request for a number of reasons. For example, your request may be denied if the health information is accura te and complete, was not created by the Plan (unless the person or entity that created the information is no longer available), is not part of the designated record set, or is not available for inspection (e.g., psychotherapy notes or inform ation compiled for civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings). If you want to exercise this right, your request to the Plan must be in writing, submitted to the Contact below, and you must include a statement to support the requested amendment. Within 60 days of receipt of your request, the Plan will take one of these actions: Make the amendment as requested Provide a written denial that explains why your request was denied and any rights you may have to disagree or file a complaint Provide a written statement that the time period for reviewing your request will be extended for no more than 30 more days, along with the reasons for the delay and the date by which the Plan expects to address your request Right to receive an accounting of disclosures of your health inf ormation You have the right to a list of certain disclosures of your health information the Plan has made. This is often referred to as an \"accounting of disclosures.\" You generally may receive this accounting if the disclosure is required by law, in connection with public health activities, or in similar situations listed in the table earlier in this notice, unless otherwise indicated below. You may receive information on disclosures of your health information for up to six years before the date of your r equest. You do not have a right to receive an accounting of any disclosures made in any of these circumstances: For treatment, payment, or health care operations To you about your own health information Incidental to other permitted or required disclosures Where authorization was provided To family members or friends involved in your care (where disclosure is permitted without authorization) For national security or intelligence purposes or to correctional institutions or law enforcement officials in certai n circumstances 56 As part of a \"limited data set\" (health information that excludes certain identifying information) In addition, your right to an accounting of disclosures to a health oversight agency or law enforcement official may be suspended at the request of the agency or official. If you want to exercise this right, your request to the Plan must be in writing and submitted to the Contact below.

The program is administered according to federal rules permitting employer -sponsored wellness programs that seek to improve co- worker health or prevent disease, including the Amer icans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as applicable, among others. If you choose to participate in the wellness program you will be asked to complete a voluntary health risk assessment or \"HRA\" that asks a series of questions about your health- related activities and behaviors and whether you have or had certain medical conditions (e.g., cancer, diabetes, or heart disease). You are not required to complete the HRA or participate in other program requirements. However, co- workers and any eligible spouses who choose to participate in the wellness program will receive discounted medical plan premiums for completing program requirements. Although you are not required to complete the HRA or participate in other program requirements, only co- workers and eligible spouses who do so will receive discounted medical premiums. If you are unable to participate in any of the health- related activities required to earn an incentive, you may be entitled to a reasonable accommodation or an alternative standard. You may request a reasonable accommodation or an alternative standard by contacting the MyWell -Being at (260) 266-6490. The information from your HRA and other screenings will be used to provide you with information to help you understand your current health and potential risks and may also be used to offer you services through the wellness program. You also are encouraged to share your results or concerns with your own doctor. Protections from Disclosure of Medical Information We are required by law to maintain the privacy and security of your personally identifiable health information. Although the wellness program and Parkview Health may use aggregat e information it collects to design a program based on identified health risks in the workplace, Parkview Health MyWell -Being will never disclose any of your personal information either publicly or to the employer, except as necessary to respond to a request from you for a reasonable accommodation needed to participate in the wellness program, or as expressly permitted by law. Medical information that personally identifies you that is provided in connection with the wellness program will not be provided to your supervisors or managers and may never be used to make decisions regarding your employment. Your health information will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or otherwise disclosed except to the extent permitted by law to carry out specific activities related to the wellness program, and you will not be asked or required to waive the confidentiality of your health information as a condition of participating in the wellness program or receiving an incentive. Anyone who receives your informatio n for purposes of providing you services as part of the wellness program will abide by the same confidentiality requirements. Individuals who may receive your personally identifiable health information include MyWell- Being personnel and others as appropriate to provide you with services under the wellness program. Your health information may also be shared with the Signature Care Employee Medical Benefit Plan. 58 In addition, all medical information obtained through the wellness program will be maintained separate from your personnel records, and no information you provide as part of the wellness program will be used in making any employment decision. Appropriate precautions will be taken to avoid any data breach, and in the event a data breach occurs involvi ng your unsecured protected health information you provide in connection with the wellness program, we will notify you as required by law. You may not be discriminated against in employment because of the medical information you provide as part of parti cipating in the wellness program, nor may you be subjected to retaliation if you choose not to participate. If you have questions or concerns regarding this notice, or about protections against discrimination and retaliation, or other compliance concerns, please call (855) 773- 0012. HIPAA Notice of Reasonable Alternative Standards (for Health -Contingent Wellness Programs) Your health plan is committed to helping you achieve your best health. If you think you might be unable to meet program requirements of a health- contingent wellness program, you might qualify for an opportunity to earn the same credit by different means. Contact MyWell -Being at (260) 266- 6490 who will work with you (and, if you wish, with your doctor) to find a wellness program with the s ame credit that is right for you in light of your health status. 59 60 "}
