Lauren Houser, CRNP When I left family practice and joined [Philadelphia Integrative Medicine](https://lance-isakov-f4mx.squarespace.com/) last year, well-meaning family and friends expressed confusion and some concern. I was constantly asked, what is integrative medicine? Answering this question frequently, I came up with my \"elevator response\" or quick and simple answer. I would describe integrative medicine as a patient centered approach that combines the best of conventional medicine with evidence based complementary therapies. While this is certainly part of the answer, it is not the whole picture. So what is Integrative Health and Medicine? The official definition from [Dr. Andrew Weil, MD](http://www.drweil.com/), who is broadly described as the \"guru\" for holistic health and integrative medicine, is : Integrative Medicine is a healing-oriented medicine that takes account of the whole person (mind, body and spirit), including all aspects of lifestyle. It emphasizes the therapeutic relationship between practitioner and patient, is informed by evidence and makes use of all appropriate therapies. This description eloquently emphasizes that integrative medicine is focused on promoting our body's natural ability to heal. Many people have a disconnect with their body and health, viewing them as broken and expecting our healthcare providers or a pill to \"fix\" the issue. As integrative medicine providers, we help our patients focus on lifestyle interventions that activate the body's natural healing mechanisms to restore wellness. Here is what our Health Physician [Dr Tetlow](https://philly-im.com/integrative-medicine-team/#GT) has to say about it. What is the difference between Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary/Holistic Medicine? There is some confusion as to what the difference is between integrative, alternative and complementary/holistic medicine. Alternative medicine is typically defined as a non-mainstream practice used in place of conventional medicine. Holistic and complementary medicine means a non-mainstream practice is used together with conventional medicine. Integrative medicine incorporates complementary approaches into mainstream health care. What is Integrative Medicine used for? What can it cure/heal or make better As integrative medicine providers, we help our patients focus on lifestyle interventions that activate the body's natural healing mechanisms to restore wellness. We see a variety of different patients at our integrative medicine clinic. Integrative medicine offers a unique and very effective approach to chronic disease because it focuses on finding the root cause and helping the body to heal. The most commonly treated conditions we see are: Autoimmune, Digestive complaints, Osteoporosis, Hypertension, High cholesterol, Chronic pain, Fibromyalgia and While some of our patients come to us for a current medical condition, we have many patients who are well and are interested in optimizing their health and preventing future disease. [Integrative Medicine Treatments](https://lance-isakov-f4mx.squarespace.com/appointments) and Methods: What to expect during an integrative medicine appointment? This is common question we hear in our practice for good reason, how is it different than seeing my primary? As integrative medicine providers, we take the time to really get to know you. We ask about not only your past medical and family history but your diet, sleep patterns, emotional health, [mind body practices](https://lance-isakov-f4mx.squarespace.com/blog/five-minutes-of-mindfulness) and spiritual life. Most importantly, we want to know what your health goals are and focus our assessment and treatment recommendations on helping you achieve them. As holistic providers, we utilize nutrition, exercise, mind body practices, supplements and sometimes conventional prescription medications to help achieve these health goals. In addition, [Philadelphia Integrative Medicine](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/59a037d34c0dbf261600c0ec/59a81659365ffafeafd69850/59a8172d365ffafeafd6ad68/1504188205921/?format=original) incorporates cutting edge functional medicine and specialty lab testing to help determine root causes of illness. This is a unique approach and often very different from the \"band aid treatments\" conventional providers are trained to provide.
