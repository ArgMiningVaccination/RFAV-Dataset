T witter: @KimLJacobson; e-mail: kim.jacobson@monash.eduChronic viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C, are long-standing global health bur - dens that have evaded control by an antibody-mediated vac - cine. The inability to clear virus from the body can cause irreparable and potentially fatal organ damage if left untreated. SARS-CoV-2 is the newest virus with the potential to cause a persisting infec - tion1, with severe disease correlating to dysregulation in antibody responses2. Efficiently treating patients who battle to clear the infec - tion has proven problematic. Thus, it is critical to understand why the immune system fails to produce effective adaptive responses to chronic virus. While progress in this area has focused on T cell dysfunction, the mechanistic changes that lead to sustained B cell dysfunction have remained elusive. Antibody production is a critical component of effective anti - viral immune responses. During a T cell-dependent response, antigen-activated B cells form an early wave of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), followed by a germinal center (GC) reaction within which B cells undergo affinity maturation. The generation of a high-affinity repertoire is a finely regulated process driven by tran - scription factors. Among them, c-Myc is transiently expressed in the GC light zone (LZ) and is responsible for selection of antigen-specific clones for further expansion in the dark zone (DZ) 3-5, followed by differentiation into high-affinity ASCs and memory B cells. Antibodies help clear infections through several key mechanisms: direct neutralization, non-neutralizing functions and mediating affinity maturation of GC B cells. However, antibodies can be a double-edged sword during chronic infection. Ineffective humoral responses are underpinned by three major alterations: polyclonal B cell expansion 6-8, altered B cell memory9 and changes to the quantity and quality of antibody. Excessive IgG in the serum leads to an over - load of immune complexes6 (ICs) that suppress antibody-mediated innate effector functions and counterintuitively limits viral clear - ance10,11. IC deposition during chronic infection can cause destruc - tive tissue pathology in both patients and in mice12,13. However, quantity is not the sole consideration for understanding how anti - bodies contribute to protection versus pathogenicity, as it does not necessarily correlate with antibody efficacy 10,14. Efficacy arises from neutralizing capacity and Fc-mediated functions, both critical for clearing viral infection 15-18. Despite the evidence of humoral dysreg - ulation during chronic infection, few therapeutic options exist for modulating humoral responses to recover functionality and drive viral clearance in chronic infection. Epigenetic modifiers, such as chromatin-remodeling histone modifiers and DNA methyltransferases, are vital regulators under - pinning B cell fate19,20. During chronic viral infection, histone modi - fiers regulate functional differences between exhausted CD8+ T cells and effector memory subsets21,22. Epigenetic regulators have been shown to dysregulate B cells in lymphomas23,24 and in autoimmune T argeting BMI-1 in B cells restores effective humoral immune responses and controls chronic viral infection Andrea Di Pietro1,2, Jack Polmear 1,2, Lucy J.

Good-Jacobson 1,2 Ineffective antibody-mediated responses are a key characteristic of chronic viral infection. However, our understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms that drive this dysregulation are unclear. Here, we identify that targeting the epigenetic modifier BMI-1 in mice improves humoral responses choriomeningitis virus. BMI-1 was upregulated by germinal center B cells in chronic viral infection, correlating with changes to the accessible chromatin landscape, compared to acute infection. B cell-intrinsic deletion of Bmi1 accelerated viral clearance, reduced splenomegaly and restored splenic architec- ture. Deletion of Bmi1 restored c-Myc expression in B cells, concomitant with improved quality of antibody and coupled with reduced antibody-secreting cell numbers. Specifically, BMI-1-deficiency induced antibody with increased neutralizing capac-ity and enhanced antibody-dependent effector function. Using a small molecule inhibitor to murine BMI-1, we could deplete antibody-secreting cells and prohibit detrimental immune complex formation in vivo. This study defines BMI-1 as a crucial immune modifier that controls antibody-mediated responses in chronic infection.

Y et, the B cell-intrinsic roles of epigenetic regulators in humoral dysfunction during chronic infection are undetermined. We hypothesized that the chronic inflammatory environment generated by persistent infections could perturb the expression and activity of epigenetic modifiers in the GC during the production of high-affinity ASCs. Using a combination of deep-sequencing, genetic tools and small molecule inhibitors, we demonstrate that a dysfunctional B cell fate in viral infection is dictated by the histone modifier BMI-1. results BMI-1 is increased in B cells during chronic viral infection. To elucidate how chronic viral infection disrupts B cell differentiation and identify key intrinsic determinants of dysfunction, we used the comparative lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model. C57BL/6 mice were infected with either LCMV-WE or LCMV-Docile, two closely related strains of LCMV , to induce either an acute (WE) or chronic (Docile) infection. Using this model, we investigated whether chronic infection resulted in changes to the epigenomic landscape within responding B cells. GC B cells (CD19 +IgDloCD95+CD38loCD138) were isolated 14 d after infec - assay for transposase-accessible RNA-seq was undertaken (Fig. ATAC-seq was used to determine regions of chromatin accessibility within the genome that may be altered during chronic infection and correlated to changes in gene expression as determined by RNA-seq. Principal-component analysis (PCA) showed that samples within the same group (WE or Docile) clustered together. Overall, 889 differentially accessible regions (DARs) were identified between acute and chronic GC B cells, with an overall increase (561 DARs) in accessibility in chronic infection (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 1a-c). The frequency of DARs in the promoter-transcription start site region was 11%, with the majority of DARs within the intergenic and intron regions (Extended Data Fig. 1b). In accor dance increased chromatin - 545 differentially with 505 genes upregulated in chronic GC B cells compared to acute GC B cells (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d-h; select ASCs and interferon (IFN)-regulated genes indicated). To determine which of these DEGs may be directly regulated by changes to chromatin accessi - bility at their loci, overlap analysis of the datasets was performed. A total of 39 DEGs in GC B cells responding to LCMV-WE or LCMV-Docile had corresponding DARs identified by ATAC-seq (Extended Data Fig. 1i,j; several different DARs were identified for individual genes). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was then utilized to gain further insight into the gene networks altered in chronic infection. In accordance with an increase of ASCs in chronic infection, IPA revealed differentiation and quantity of plasma cells, as well as GC B cells, in the top ten disease and biological func - tions altered across the two conditions (Fig. 1e,f). This was despite excluding CD138+ cells from the sort-purified GC B cells used for ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analyses. The increase in chromatin accessibility regions led us to hypoth - esize that epigenetic modifiers that repress gene expression may be dysregulated during chronic viral infection. Two important com - plexes that are known regulators of B cell fate are the Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs). PRC1 and PRC2 consist of several subunits with the ability to support and deposit H2AK119Ub1 and H3K27me3, respectively, regulating expression of target genes required for formation and maintenance of GCs 23,24,26. We observed 49 PRC1 targets (Fig. 1g) and 80 PRC2 targets (Extended Data Fig. 1k) with altered chromatin accessibility in chronic GC B cells. In our DEG dataset, 63 PRC1 targets (Fig. 1g) and 74 PRC2 targets were differentially expressed (Extended Data Fig. 1k). Among the over - lapped targets from the two datasets, the analysis identified We next assessed whether expression of PRC components them - selves was altered in chronic GC B cells. Expression of components of the canonical PRC1 co-factors (Extended Data Fig. 1l) were mostly unchanged in chronic infection, with Ring1b , Suz12, Rbbp4 and Bcor decreased, whereas Bmi1 was increased compared to acute GC B cells. The increase in Bmi1 was a surprising finding. Previous reports have not observed BMI-1 in murine GC B cells 26, although it has been detected in the LZ of GC in human tonsils27 and is expressed in human ASCs28. BMI-1 is a Polycomb group protein that activates the catalytic component RING1B of PRC1 (ref. 29), which in turn deposits monoubiquitin at lysine 119 of histone H2A 30. Functionally, BMI-1 allows stable silencing of gene expres - sion, regulating lineage commitment, self-renewal, proliferation and survival 31-36. BMI-1 was originally identified as an oncogenic collaborator of c-Myc37,38 that is upregulated in Myc-induced B cell malignancies39 and myeloma34,40; however, its role during humoral responses to infection has not been determined. We proposed that Bmi1 upregulation in chronic GC B cells may be connected to the increase in plasma cell gene networks. To understand murine Bmi1 expression dynamics, we used a tamoxifen-inducible Bmi1 CreERT2Rosa26EYFP reporter mouse to tem - porally examine Bmi1 expression on a per-cell basis. We first assessed which B cell subsets express BMI-1 in a precipitated in the adjuvant alum, Fig. 1 | Gene expression and chromatin accessibility regions in GC B cells during chronic viral infection are distinct from acute viral infection. a, Schematic of experimental setup.

Bmi1 CreERT2Rosa26EYFP reporter mice were infected with LCMV-WE or LCMV-Docile and tamoxifen was administered every 24 h from d9-11 (Fig. 1i). Infection with LCMV-Docile induced a significant increase in the frequency of EYFP + lympho - cytes, compared to LCMV-WE (Fig. 1j,k). B and BMI-1 was increased ~threefold in chroni - cally infected mice, compared to acutely infected mice, with a higher proportion within the ASC population (Fig. 1l). Within the GC population, the increase in EYFP + cells in LCMV-Docile-infected mice was localized to the LZ population, whereas DZ cells had an equivalent frequency of EYFP + cells following acute or chronic infection (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Furthermore, when steady-state ASCs were assessed for EYFP expression, EYFP + cells were signifi - cantly increased in the bone marrow compared to the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 1m). Thus, Bmi1 expression was enriched in the ASC population compared to GC B cells, correlat - ing with an increase in tissues with higher frequencies of long-lived plasma cells. The increase in Bmi1 transcript in EYFP + subsets, as well as increased Bmi1 transcript and BMI-1 protein in B cell sub - sets responding to LCMV-Docile compared to LCMV-WE from wild-type mice, was confirmed by quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) and immunoblot analyses (Extended Data Fig. 2f-k). Combined, BMI-1 is conventionally enriched in ASCs and differentially expressed in GC B cells responding to either acute or chronic strains of LCMV . Bmi1 deletion in B cells accelerates LCMV-Docile clearance. We next asked whether modulation of BMI-1 in B cells in chronic infec - tion determined productive outcomes to viral infection. To delete Bmi1 in mature B cells, we generated Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice by cross - ing mice that carry floxed alleles of Bmi1 with mice expressing a Cre recombinase under the control of the B cell-specific Cd23 promoter. Bmi1 f/fCd23Cre/+ and control Cd23Cre/+ mice were infected with LCMV-Docile and assessed throughout infection. Notably, Bmi1f/ fCd23Cre/+ mice had significantly reduced viral titers (fivefold Cd23Cre/+Cd23Cre/+ * *** * 7 14 28d 7 14 28 Days after infectionDays after infectionSplenocytes (no. \u00d7 108) e Day 7 105 104 10300.51.01.52.0 05,00010,00020,00040,000p.f.u. ml-1 (500 mg ml-1 liver) Fig. 2 | Conditional deletion of Bmi1 in B cells results in accelerated clearance of chronic viral infection. a, Cd23Cre/+ and Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice were infected with LCMV-Docile and livers were assessed for viral plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) at d28, n=10 Cd23Cre/+ and n=11 represent mean\u00b1s.e.m. ***P=0.000264 (Mann-Whitney U-test, two-tailed P value). b, Time course of viral p.f.u. of the indicated time points after infection and and Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice infected with LCMV-Docile at d14 after infection. d, Splenocyte number at the indicated time mice, combined from at least two individual experiments per time point.

Time-course analyses demonstrated that viral titers were similar between control and BMI-1-deficient mice at d7; however, a 2.4-fold decrease was detected by d14 (Fig. 2b), concomitant with a significant increase in weight gain compared to Cd23 Cre/+ mice (Extended Data Fig. 3a). At d14 after infection, spleens from Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice were notice - ably smaller than control mice (Fig. 2c) and splenocyte numbers were reduced (Fig. 2d). Frequencies of innate, CD4 + and CD8+ T cell populations were comparable between Cd23Cre/+ and Bmi1f/fCd- 23Cre/+ mice (Extended Data Fig. 3b-f). Functionally, there was no difference in killing capacity of gp33+CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3g) or production of IFN- on a per-cell basis (Extended Data Fig. 3h). Infection with LCMV disrupts splenic architecture 41-43, particularly B cell zones (Fig. 2e; Cd23Cre/+ mice; spleens from uninfected mice are shown in Extended Data Fig. 3i). In contrast, spleens from Bmi1 f/fCd23Cre/+ mice displayed intact fol - licular structures and T cell areas (Fig. 2e; Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+). Thus, depletion of BMI-1 in mature B cells resulted in normalized splenic size and architecture and accelerated viral clearance. Increase in antibody function in the absence of BMI-1. Changes to antibody quality and quantity contribute to ineffective humoral responses during chronic viral infection. Given that B cell-specific deletion of BMI-1 led to accelerated viral clearance, we hypothe - sized that the efficacy of antibody, either through neutralizing or non-neutralizing effector function, was increased in Bmi1f/fCd- 23Cre/+ mice. To test this, LCMV-Docile-infected Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ and Cd23Cre/+ mice were assessed for neutralizing antibody capac - ity. Neutralizing antibodies formed to chronic LCMV emerge late in the response, increasing approximately 2 months after infection 44. By contrast, antibodies from Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice had an increased capacity to reduce plaque formation in vitro at d14, compared to antibodies from control mice (Fig. 3a). The tuning of antibody quality occurs by glycosylation of a con - served N-linked glycan of the IgG constant region (Fc), which dynamically modulated by the pathogen-influenced microenvi - ronment during an immune response45,46. Shifts in glycosylation can have antiviral or anti-inflammatory effects, regulate complement activation and enhance the effectiveness of neutralizing antibod - ies16,47. Therefore, to elucidate the efficacy of antibody produced in BMI-1-deficient mice, we assessed IgG Fc N-linked glycan pro - files. While most glycosylation patterns remained unchanged in the absence of BMI-1 (Extended Data Fig. 4a), there was a significant decrease in G2Z1F, whereas the corresponding G2Z1 remained unchanged (Fig. 3b). Afucosylated forms of IgG can increase anti - body efficacy48, enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic - ity (ADCC)49 and induce effective innate cell function during chronic viral infection50. Specifically, the G2Z1F glycoform has been shown to be enriched in the IgG2c subset and is thought to act as a dampener of this pro-inflammatory isotype 51. To determine whether antibody efficacy was increased by reduction of this gly - coform, we compared the ability of antibody from Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ and Cd23Cre/+ mice to induce ADCC. Using natural killer (NK) cells from wild-type mice, ADCC was significantly enhanced using sera collected from LCMV-Docile-infected Bmi1 f/fCd23Cre/+ mice, com - pared to sera from Cd23Cre/+ mice (Fig. 3c). Taken together, these data reveal BMI-1 as a key regulator of antibody efficacy in chronic viral infection. We next investigated the kinetics of ASC production. The fre - quency of CD19+IgD+ cells (enriched in naive B cells) was compa - rable between Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice and controls, as was the ability of CD19+IgD to form GC B cells (Extended Data Fig. 4b-e). At d14, the total number of CD19+IgD+ and cells was signifi - cantly reduced. BMI-1-deficient GC B cells were able to isotype switch to IgG2c and to maintain detectable virus-specific IgG2c (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g). In contrast, B cell-specific deletion of BMI-1 altered the dynamics of ASCs. In LCMV-Docile-infected Cd23 Cre/+ mice, ASC formation peaked at d14 before declining to low levels by d21 (Fig. 3d-f ). In comparison, ASC frequency, but not total number, was increased in Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice at d7, before a significant decrease in both frequency and number at d14 compared to controls (Fig. 3f ). Notably, there was not a com - plete absence of ASCs; in fact, the reduction of d14 ASC frequency and number (Fig. 3e) resembled that observed in LCMV-WE (acute)-infected mice. Similarly, GC B cell frequency and num - ber (Fig. 3g) and circulating ICs (Fig. 3h) in BMI-1-deficient mice infected with LCMV-Docile, resembled that observed in control mice infected with LCMV-WE. To confirm that changes to the ASC population were B cell-intrinsic, 1:1 mixed bone-marrow chi - meras were established with Ly5.1 and Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ bone mar - row (Fig. 3i). Infected chimeras showed a significant reduction in BMI-1-deficient ASCs compared to Ly5.1 (Fig. antibodies, augmentation of antibody-dependent effector function and reduction in circulating ICs are consistent with more potent immune responses in LCMV-Docile-infected Bmi1 f/fCd23Cre/+ mice.

NATUre IMMUNOLOG | JAnUAR y 2022 | | www.nature.com/natureimmunology 90Articles NaTUrE IMMUNologyRelationship of c-Myc and BMI-1 in chronic viral infection. Affinity maturation is highly regulated to avoid the survival and expansion of potentially autoreactive or cancerous clones. A critical regulator of the selection process is c-Myc 3,4. Given the role of BMI-1 in Myc-induced B cell malignancies39 and the heterogeneity of both Bmi1 and Myc3,4 expression in the GC, we hypothesized that BMI-1 and c-Myc may collaborate to regulate the efficacy of the antibody response to infection. EYFP+ and EYFP GC B cells were isolated from BMI-1 reporter mice infected with either LCMV-WE or LCMV-Docile (Fig. 4a). Of note, Myc expression was selectively expressed in the EYFP+ GC B cell subset, with a 21-fold increase compared to EYFP GC B cells (Fig. 4b). The fold change of Myc expression in EYFP+ GC B cells responding to chronic infection was considerably higher compared to the acute WE-infected cohort, in which there was a twofold, nonsignificant increase in EYFP + over EYFP (Fig. 4b). We next investigated whether Bmi1 deletion affected Myc expres - sion. Total GC B cells from LCMV-Docile-infected Cd23Cre/+ mice had increased expression of Myc compared to LCMV-WE (Fig. 4c). B cell-specific BMI-1 deletion selectively reduced Myc expression in LCMV-Docile-infected mice to the level observed in LCMV-WE infection (Fig. 4c). In contrast, there was no significant change in gene expression of other reported targets of BMI-1, Bcl2l11 (encod - ing Bim)34 and Pmaip1 (encoding Noxa)33 in acute or chronically infected Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice (Extended Data Fig. 4h). d hfb ** * * ** *7 14 21 28 Days after infection7 of * *** ** **020406080 ** Dilution (1/x)816 32 No s. 128 y | www.nature.com/natureimmunology 91Articles is localized to the LZ in immunization models3,4. Given the increase in Myc in chronic infection, we hypoth - esized that c-Myc would no longer be tightly regulated within the GC. Indeed, histological analyses of Cd23Cre/+ mice infected with LCMV-Docile revealed c-Myc expression throughout the GC (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 5a). In contrast, GCs in Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice were mostly absent of c-Myc expression, with only a few cells evidently expressing c-Myc (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 5b). Therefore, conditional deletion of BMI-1 restored regulated expres - sion of c-Myc within the GC. Given the changes in expression and distribution of c-Myc, we next examined whether somatic hypermutation and/or affinity mat - uration of GC B cells was altered at d14 post-infection (Extended Data Fig. 5c-f). No clear differences were observed in mutation levels (Extended Data Fig. 5c). To examine affinity maturation in BMI-1-sufficient versus BMI-1-deficient GC B cells, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations (N/S) (Extended Data Fig. 5d) and selection pressure (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f) was assessed. The ratio of N/S in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) was decreased in GC B cells isolated from Cd23 Cre/+ mice responding to chronic infection, compared to acute infec - tion, suggestive of reduced affinity maturation. In contrast, GC B cells isolated from LCMV-Docile-infected Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice had a N/S ratio comparable to that of Cd23Cre/+ mice infected with LCMV-WE (Extended Data Fig. 5d). We then quantified the link to selection pressure more precisely with BASELINe (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). B cell receptor (BCR) sequences from either Cd23 Cre/+ or Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice infected with LCMV-WE had more positive selection in the CDR region than those infected with LCMV-Docile; however, the trend toward positive selection returned in Bmi1f/fCd- 23Cre/+ mice responding to chronic infection, compared to Cd23Cre/+ mice, although it was not completely restored to that of acute infec - tion. In contrast to the CDR, there was little change in the negative selection detected in the framework regions (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Taken together, affinity maturation seemed to be improved in Bmi1f/ fCd23Cre/+ mice during chronic infection. The elevation in BMI-1 and c-Myc expression in chronic GC B cells prompted us to ask whether there was a particular pathogen-influenced microenvironmental change that may induce these differences in B cell transcriptional programs. A key candi - date was IL-21, a cytokine that regulates B cell behavior52,53 and can induce context-specific Myc expression54. Notably, IL-21 production by helper T cells in chronic viral infection is substantially higher than in acute viral infection 55. We therefore tested whether there was a dose-dependent induction of Bmi1 and Myc in in vitro-stimulated B cells, co-cultured with increasing concentrations of IL-21 (Fig. 4f-h). While B cells cultured with low IL-21 concentrations did not increase Bmi1 (Fig. 4f ) or Myc (Fig. 4g) over the baseline stimuli (CD40L, IL-4 and IL-5), significant upregulation was evi - dent at high IL-21 levels (Fig. 4f,g). The observed increase was not simply due to a change in plasmablast frequency within the cultures, as there was no significant change in plasmablast frequency between 25-50 ng ml 1 IL-21 (Fig. 4h). Together, these data reveal that the disruption in c-Myc regulation during chronic infection correlated with increased IL-21 and that conditional deletion of BMI-1 restores expression and localization of c-Myc-expression in GC B cells. H2AK119Ub1 is decreased at key loci in chronic infection. The non-canonical form of PRC1 (which excludes BMI-1) and PRC2 are required for GC formation 26. The ability of BMI-1-deficient B cells to form GCs and upregulation of BMI-1 in ASCs, suggest a switch between the non-canonical and the canonical forms of PRC1 to reg - ulate B cell fate. This switch seemed to be disrupted in chronic GC B cells, with upregulation of Bmi1 , Myc and ASC-related genes (Fig. 5a). Accordingly, c-Myc-target genes were significantly enriched in chronic GC B cells, compared to the acute gene expression profile (Fig. 5b,c), concomitant with identification of several c-Myc targets within DARs (Fig. 5c). Given that the non-canonical PRC1 deposits H2AK119Ub1 at key loci in GC B cells, it was unclear how changes in BMI-1 expres - sion affected PRC1 function, if at all. We first asked whether changes in H2AK119Ub1 and H3K27me3, the histone marks regulated by PRC1 and PRC2, respectively, were altered at key loci in acute ver - sus chronic GC B cells. There was a clear change in H2AK119Ub1 in control GC B cells between LCMV-WE- and LCMV-Docile-infected mice (Fig. 5d). B cells from LCMV-Docile mice had a significant decrease in H2AK119Ub1 at Myc and Prdm1 loci (Fig. cell-specific BMI-1 dele - tion in at Myc and Prdm1 loci in unswitched B cells, with a less prominent increase at Irf4 in IgD B cells. While there was a trend increase in H3K27me3 in the absence of BMI-1, in most cases this change was not signifi - cant (Fig. 5e). Thus, conditional deletion of BMI-1 restored monou - biquitination at H2AK119 in chronic B cells to similar levels as control B cells responding to acute viral infection. To determine whether the BMI-1-dependent change in H2AK119Ub1 regulated gene expression, we performed RNA-seq analysis of acute versus chronic GCB from Cd23 Cre/+ or Bmi1 Cd23Cre/+ mice (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Using the DEGs identified in both Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 6 datasets to explore whether BMI-1-deficiency restored chronic GC B cell gene expression to resemble that of acute GCB, we identified five distinct signatures (Fig. 5f). BMI-1 deletion partially restored gene profiles to that of control GCB responding to acute infection. Among these five clusters (C1-5), genes listed in C1 and C4 showed similar expres - sion patterns between BMI-1-sufficient acute GC B cells and BMI-1-deficient chronic GC B cells (magnified heat maps; Fig. 5f). Taken together, these results underscore the crucial role of BMI-1 in regu - lating gene expression in B cells responding to chronic infection. BMI-1 regulates ASCs in response to NP-KLH immunization. The differences observed in BMI-1 expression and function in B cells responding to acute versus chronic viral infection prompted us to investigate the specific role of BMI-1 during B cell differentiation Fig. 4 | r egulation of c-Myc in BMI-1-deficient mice. a, Schematic of infection and tamoxifen administration of Bmi1CreERT2Rosa26EyFP reporter mice. b, RT- qPCR analyses of Myc expression in EyFP and EyFP+ GC B cells from reporter mice infected with LCMV-Docile (d7 after infection; 2-Ct method relative n=8 EyFP+; combined from two (WE) and experiments.

Histological analyses revealed the loss of splenic IgG1bright cells at d7 after immunization (Fig. 6a). Correspondingly, there was a significant decrease in the total fre - quency of BMI-1-deficient ASCs (Fig. (Fig. 6d,e), although d7 IgG1 and IgM antibody levels were comparable between BMI-1-deficient mice and controls (Extended Data Fig. 6b). As ASCs can arise from either GC-independent or GC-dependent pathways, we assessed whether the defect in ASCs was due to a loss of GC B cells. Bmi1 f/fCd23Cre/+ B cells formed GCs, isotype switched and fold change (2-/uni0394/uni0394Ct)Bmi1f/f Cd23Cre/+Cd23Cre/+ NATUre IMMUNOLOG y | | | www.nature.com/natureimmunology 93Articles NaTUrE IMMUNologyappropriate and LZ ratios, in a manner comparable to Cd23Cre/+ mice (Extended Data Fig. 6c-e). The ability of B cells to form GCs in Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice is consistent with a previous study demon - strating that NP+IgDlo B cell could expand after immunization in Bmi1 germline knockouts56. While only a small fraction of GC B cells was EYFP+ after immunization, Myc was ~sixfold upregulated in EYFP+ compared to EYFP GC B cells (Extended Data Fig. 6f). To assess whether modulating BMI-1 expression affected affinity maturation, Vh186.2 in GC B cells was sequenced (Fig. 6f,g and Extended Data Fig. 6g). The overall number of mutations (Fig. 6f ) and CDR3 length (Extended Data Fig. 6g) was comparable between Bmi1 f/fCd23Cre/+ and Cd23Cre/+ mice; however, there was an increase in mutations in CDR1 (P = 0.0594) and a significant decrease in mutations in CDR3 (P = 0.0448) in the absence of BMI-1 (Fig. 6f ). Next, the affinity-enhancing replacement of the codon encoding for amino acid tryptophan by that encoding leucine at position 33 (W33L) of Vh186.2 was measured. The percentage of the W33L mutation was increased in GCB from Bmi1 f/fCd23Cre/+ compared to Cd23Cre/+ mice (71% compared to 55%, respectively) (Fig. 6g). Therefore, while GC B cells could form in Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice, B cell-specific BMI-1 deletion led to an increase of high-affinity vari - ants within GC B cells, but a decrease in ASC output. The data presented thus far suggested that BMI-1 was impor - tant for GC to ASC differentiation. We next asked whether BMI-1 directly regulated ASC survival independent of its role in differenti - ation. To specifically determine whether steady-state ASCs relied on BMI-1 for their survival, we generated Bmi1 f/fPrdm1Rosa26CreERT2 mice in which BMI-1 is inducibly deleted in Prdm1 (the gene encod - ing Blimp-1)-expressing cells. Uninfected Bmi1f/fPrdm1Rosa26CreERT2 and control mice were administered with tamoxifen and ASCs were assessed 7 and 14 d later (Fig. 6h). Tamoxifen administration significantly reduced the frequency of ASCs at d14, and ASC num - ber at both time points (Fig. 6i), but not GC B cells (Extended Data Fig. 6h-j) demonstrating that BMI-1 is an important regulator of ASC survival. Small molecule inhibition of BMI-1 depletes ASCs. Targeting detrimental antibodies and ICs is a therapeutic goal for chronic infectious and inflammatory disorders. Given that BMI-1 regulated ASC survival, we assessed small molecule inhibition of BMI-1 to modulate ASC and IC formation. First, naive B cells were stimu - lated in vitro to induce plasmablast differentiation, which was significantly reduced by PTC-209 (ref. 57) in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 7a and Extended Data Fig. 7a). While plasmablasts were reduced, the ability of B cells to undergo division was unaf - fected across doses (Extended Data Fig. 7b), with the exception of 1.25 M (not shown). Next, C57BL/6 mice were infected with LCMV-Docile and after 2 d to allow initial activation of the immune response, were given daily administrations of PTC-028, an inhibitor that targets and degrades BMI-1 through hyperphosphorylation 58 (Fig. 7b). LCMV-Docile-infected mice that received the vehicle con - trol lost weight before stabilization at 85% of the original body weight at d8 after infection (Fig. 7c). In contrast, LCMV-Docile-infected mice administered with PTC-028 lost <5% body weight up to d3 after infection, but then recovered by d5 (Fig. 7c). Similar to Bmi1 f/ fCd23Cre/+ mice, ASC frequency and number were significantly reduced after PTC-028 treatment, compared to controls (3.3-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively; Fig. 7d). Concomitantly, LCMV-specific IgG2c IC (Fig. 7f ) were significantly decreased in the PTC-028 group compared to vehicle controls. While liver viral titers were not significantly reduced with this dosage regimen (not shown), splenic architecture was restored in mice adminis - tered PTC-028, similar to that observed in Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Collectively, these data reveal BMI-1 as a viable therapeutic target to deplete ASCs and reduce IC formation in immune disorders. Discussion Antibodies are a key modulator of both innate and adaptive arms of an immune response. However, in chronic infections, the qual - ity and quantity of antibodies are dysregulated and antibodies can themselves become pathogenic. Defining the mechanistic steps that shift humoral responses from effective to ineffective when viral infections persist has been elusive. Here, we identify BMI-1 as a critical regulator of B cell differentiation, which can be tar - geted therapeutically. Deletion of BMI-1 in B cells led to pleiotro - pic effects on the immune response: accelerated viral clearance, reduced splenomegaly coupled with improved lymphoid architec - ture, increased neutralizing capability and effector function of anti - body. Expression of Myc , the transcription factor that is required for B cell selection in the GC3,4, was concentrated in Bmi1-expressing cells and regulated by BMI-1 in chronic viral infection. Further, the preservation of lymphoid architecture, reduction in excessive IC or changes to the N -glycan profile of antibody within ICs may work collectively to support affinity maturation in the GC 11,59,60. These results highlight the critical direct and indirect roles of B cells con - trolling effective versus ineffective immune responses to persistent viral infection. c-Myc is expressed in proliferating cells but is known to be tightly regulated in cells undergoing selection in the LZ3,4. Similarly, in acute infection BMI-1 was expressed in only a small fraction of GC B cells but upregulated upon ASC differentiation. Chronic viral infection deregulated expression of both BMI-1 and c-Myc, concomitant with an increase in GC B cells and ASCs. Increased c-Myc may result in the disruption of GC B cell division and selec - tion, skewing cells premature differentiation5. BMI-1 and c-Myc cooperate in lymphoid transformation37,38 and can directly and indirectly regulate each other in a context-dependent man - ner61-63. Although a number of pathogen-influenced changes in the microenvironment have been recorded in chronic infection41,64,65, we reasoned that cytokine differences within the GC may mediate sustained induction of BMI-1 and c-Myc. One key cytokine that is notably increased in chronic LCMV infection, compared to acute, is IL-21 (ref. 55). Accordingly, high concentrations of IL-21, but not low levels, induced BMI-1 and c-Myc in stimulated B cells. Persisting GCs have been proposed to be beneficial in inducing broadly neu - tralizing antibodies66. However, we highlight the importance of appropriate regulation of this process under sustained inflammatory Fig. 5 | H2AK119Ub1 is decreased at key loci in B cells responding to chronic viral infection. a, Heat map of selected genes in GC B cells isolated from WT mice infected with either LCMV-WE or LCMV-Docile, assessed by RnA sequencing. b, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (canonical pathway Hallmark gene set) plot of Myc targets using the RnA-seq dataset shown in Fig. 1. c, Accessibility changes in Myc targets within DARs (ATAC-seq dataset shown in Fig. 1; top) and Myc targets within the DEG dataset (RnA-seq shown 1; or CD19 +IgD (Sw B cells) and CD19+IgD+ (UnSw) B cells isolated 7d after infection from LCMV-Docile cells isolated 14d after infection Cd23 Cre/+ (LCMV-WE or LCMV-Docile infected) or Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ (LCMV-Docile infected) mice.

Here, H2AK119Ub1 was decreased at key loci in GC B cells in chronic infection, compared to acute, suggesting a deregula - tion in PRC function. BMI-1 deletion increased H2AK119Ub1, in a seemingly paradoxical manner as BMI-1 is known to support the ubiquitin ligase activity of RING1B 29. This suggests that the aberrant recruitment of BMI-1 into the PRC1 in chronic GCs disrupts the non-canonical function of the PRC1, concomitant with - lation of BCOR, a regulator of GC biology26. It also suggests that this dynamic process is regulated by microenvironmental signals within the GC. Understanding the relationship between cytokine signaling and resultant biochemical changes in the composition of the PRCs may implicate other chronic inflammatory mediators that lead to detrimental B cell differentiation. Small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic regulators are rapidly emerging as important therapeutic tools and as such are in clini - cal trials for a number of disorders67,68. Excessive IC deposition induces substantial tissue damage in chronic infections and other antibody-mediated diseases in which depleting pre-existing ASCs is a therapeutic goal69,70. We propose that BMI-1 could be targeted with a small molecule inhibitor to deplete pre-existing detrimental plasma cells. This strategy may also be used to tackle pathogenic Spleen ****B220loCD138+ (% of live) D7 cell survival. a, Cd23Cre/+ and Bmi1f/fCd23Cre/+ mice were immunized with nP-KLH in alum.

Both male and female mice were used in the experimental research project, between 42 d and 4 months for intact mice; up to 6 months for bone-marrow chimera experiments. For immunization, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 \u00b5g 100 \u00b5l 1 per mouse of NP13-KLH precipitated in adjuvant alum. For LCMV infection, 100 l of LCMV-WE (3 \u00d7 103 p.f.u.) LCMV-Docile (2 \u00d7 106 p.f.u.) was given intravenously (i.v.) per mouse tail vain. For tamoxifen administration, Bmi1CreERT2RosaEYFP and Bmi1f/fPrdm1Rosa26CreERT2 mice were treated with tamoxifen (Sigma) dissolved in peanut oil and ethanol at 5 mg ml1. Then, 90 \u00b5l of tamoxifen or vehicle control (peanut oil and ethanol) was administered to each mouse for 3 d consecutively via oral gavage at indicated time points. Flow cytometry, cell sorting and antibodies. Single-cell suspensions were resuspended in PBS 2% FCS and stained for flow cytometric analysis. Live or fixed cells were analyzed on the Fortessa or Canto (BD); cytometry data were acquired and Normal Rat Serum (Sigma-Aldrich) were used to block nonspecific binding. For sort purification, cells were stained with fluorochrome-labeled antibodies (Supplementary Table 1) and purified by FACSAria or Influx (BD). Gating strategies used are shown in Extended Data Fig. 8. Histology. Immunofluorescence . Splenic portions were fixed for 6-8 h at 4 \u00b0C. Tissues were transferred to a 30% sucrose solution and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Spleens were then embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek) and kept frozen at 80 \u00b0C until staining. Seven-micrometer tissue sections were cut via microtome (Leica) and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides. Sections were fixed with cold acetone (Sigma) for 10 min, blocked with PBS- 5% FCS and stained using the indicated antibodies (Supplementary Table 2). Slides were observed under \u00d74 and \u00d710 magnification using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope. Images were captured with a mounted high-sensitivity cooled SPOT RT KE CCD camera; white balance and exposure were set using SPOT 5.1 imaging software. Confocal microscopy images were acquired on a Leica SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope on a DMi8 inverted stand. Overview images were acquired with a multi-immersion objective HC PL APO \u00d720/0.75 IMM CS2 objective with oil immersion. For higher resolution images an HC PL APO \u00d763/1.40 CS2 oil immersion objective was used. resolution was \u00d7 1,024. Quantitation of PNA +Myc+ cells within IgDlo as well as 100 \u00b5m scale bars and pseudo-colors, were assigned to raw images using ImageJ software. Brightness and contrast were applied equally to each image. Threshold and despeckle tools were used for quantification analysis. Immunohistochemistry. Splenic portions were frozen in OCT (Tissue-Tek). Seven-micrometer sections were cut using a microtome (Leica) at 20 \u00b0C and fixed with acetone. Staining was performed using described antibodies (Supplementary Table 3). Slides were viewed under \u00d74 and \u00d710 magnification using an Olympus CKX41 microscope and images were captured with a mounted Nikon DP-12 camera. Raw images were taken using the Nikon NIS-Element software platform and ImageJ was used to add 100-m scale bars to each image. Deletion analysis. Sort-purified subsets were processed using the NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel, 740952.250). Genomic DNA was centrifuged, lysed in RLT buffer passed a gDNA eliminator spin column (QIAGEN) to remove gDNA. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Micro kit (QIAGEN, cat. no. 74034) according to manufacturer's instructions. First-strand complementary DNA synthesis was performed with a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, cat. no. 4368814). RT-qPCR was performed with Rotor-Gene Q using the QuantiNovaSYBR Green PCR kit (QIAGEN, cat. no. 208054). The forward and reverse primers for Bmi1 (ref. 75) were 5-AATTAGTCCCAGGGCTTTTCAA-3 and 3 -CTTTGTCTCC AATCCTCCGG-5. The housekeeping Ku70 gene was used as an internal control for normalization. To assess Ku70 expression, the following set of primers was used: 5-TCGCCTTTACTGAGAAGGTGAC-3 and 3 -TGCTGCAGG ACTGGATTCTC-5. The 2 -Ct method was used to determine relative changes in gene expression. ChIP-qPCR. Sort-purified subsets were processed as published76. Briefly, sorted cells were incubated with 0.6% formaldehyde for 10 min. Crosslinking was stopped by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.25 M and cross-linked chromatin was sonicated to reduce DNA size to 200-500 base pairs (bp). Sonicated chromatin was then used for ChIP analysis. Immunoprecipitation was undertaken with mouse antibodies against H3K27me3 (Millipore, 07-449) and H2AK119Ub1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 8240). RT-qPCR was performed as described above. Primers used to amplify a fragment including the transcription start site of indicated genes were: Prdm1 5-GAGTAGTCAGTCGCTCGCTC-3 and 3 Myc 5-GCGCGAGCAA GAGAAAATGG-3 and 3 - GCTCCGGGGTGTAAACAGTA-5. Data were normalized by dividing the total copies of no-antibody control, H3K23me3 or H2AK119Ub1 to copies of the total input. Each value was then multiplied by a factor of 100 to obtain the frequency (%) of input. ELISA and ELISpot. For ELISA, LCMV-WE and Docile viral lysates were used to coat 96-well high-binding plates (Sarstedt) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Plates were then blocked with PBS 1% BSA for 1 h, washed and loaded with serially diluted serum for a 4 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C. Plates were washed again and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with IgG2c conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Southern Biotech), followed by washing and development with OPD-substrate solution (Sigma-Aldrich). For ELISPOT and ELISA of NP-KLH samples, multiscreen HA plates (Millipore) were coated overnight with NP 12BSA or NP1BSA for quantification of NP-specific IgG1+ ASCs. Plates were blocked, washed and loaded with samples prepared in RPMI 5% FCS, 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol and 2 mM glutamine before an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C. Plates were washed and subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with secondary antibody (IgG1) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotech) for 1 h. Plates were washed and developed with the BCiP/NBT reaction (Sigma-Aldrich). For ELISA analysis, high-binding plates were coated with NP 12BSA, serum samples followed by IgG1-HRP incubated as described above, before detection with OPD-substrate solution. A non-linear fit is shown (GraphPad Prism). IC precipitation. ICs were precipitated from mouse sera 11,77. Briefly, serum was incubated with a 1:1 ratio of PBS 5% PEG6000 solution overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The serum-PEG samples were mixed with RPMI 2.5% PEG6000 in a 1:3 ratio and spun down at 2,000g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. PEG precipitates were resuspended to the initially used serum volume in cold PBS and then quantified by ELISA. T cell cytotoxicity assay and IFN- production. Cytotoxicity capacity of CD8+ T cells were assessed as previously described78. Briefly, CD8+ T cells were negatively enriched using the CD8+ T cell (mouse) isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Splenocytes from Ly5.1 mice were used as targets, labeled with cell trace violet (CTV; Molecular Probes) and loaded with gp33-41 peptide at 0.1 \u00b5M. Enriched CD8+ T cells were plated with peptide-pulsed (CTV high) or unpulsed (CTV low) splenocyte target cells from Ly5.1 mice in either a 1:1 ratio of 2.5:1 ratio and incubated for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C, stained for surface markers, propidium For cytokine production, approximately 1 \u00d7 10 6 splenocytes were stimulated in vitro for 5 h with IL-2 10 U ml1 (Peprotech) and brefeldin A (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm) absence of 1 \u00b5M H2-Db gp33-41 peptide. Cells were surface stained with BD Biosciences), then fixed and permeabilized for intracellular expression of IFN-:FITC (XMG1.2, Ly5.1 and Plaque-forming unit assay and infectivity reduction assay. Livers were weighed and the calculated volume of DMEM (Gibco) was added to obtain 500 mg ml1 of suspension. One stainless steel bead (QIAGEN) was added per sample and liver tissues were homogenized using the TissueLyser LT (QIAGEN) for 5 min at 50 oscillations s 1. Beads were removed and samples were spun for 10 min at 15,000 r.p.m. (4 \u00b0C) to pellet cell debris. For the p.f.u. assay, homogenized liver suspensions were serially diluted and added onto MC57G cells. An overlay mixture of 2% methylcellulose solution and 2\u00d7 DMEM (Gibco) was added after virus adsorption and plates incubated (37 \u00b0C for 48 h). Plates were then stained with primary VL-4 antibody (previously described 79) and the secondary HRP goat NATUre IMMUNOLOG y | www.nature.com/natureimmunologyArticles NaTUrE IMMUNologyanti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Plaques were developed (HRP Substrate kit; Vector) and counted to quantify viral load. For infectivity reduction assays, sera from LCMV-infected experimental mice were inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min to eliminate pre-existing virus. Sera were then diluted and incubated for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C with a known quantity of LCMV (30 p.f.u.). The antibody-virus mixtures were added onto MC57G cells and plaques were calculated. The neutralization capacity of the serum was expressed in percentage of plaque reduction, referring to the no-serum control sample. ADCC. Target cells MC57G CTV and infected with LCMV-Docile at a multiplicity of infection of 1, 24 h before the cytotoxicity assay. Splenic NK cells were isolated from naive C57BL/6 mice using nylon wool filters (Polysciences) and seeded in complete RPMI-1640 (RPMI-1640, 5% FCS, 1% streptomycin and supplemented with 250 ng ml 1 IL-2 for 5 d. ADCC was initiated by the addition of serum, previously collected from mice infected with LCMV-Docile, to the target cells. NK cells were combined in a 10:1 effector:target ratio. The plate was further incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were collected and stained with Fixable Viability Stain (BD Biosciences) to evaluate the frequency of dead cells by FACS. IgG purification. IgG antibodies were purified from plasma according to manufacturer's protocol (Melon Gel IgG Purification kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Purified IgG antibody samples were centrifuged through 100 kDa Amicon Ultra filters (Merck) at 14,000g for 10 min to remove excess serum proteins and buffer was exchanged into PBS. Purity was confirmed via SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) and IgG concentrations LabChip GXII Touch protocol Microchip capillary electrophoresis analysis of digested and labeled N-linked glycans was performed. The relative prevalence of major N-linked glycan profiles of IgG was analyzed using the LabChip GX Reviewer (PerkinElmer) software. Peaks were assigned based on the migration of known standards and glycan digests 45. Peak area and relative prevalence of each glycan pattern were calculated. In vitro B cell stimulation. B cells were isolated using a B cell negative enrichment kit (STEMCELL). Cells were resuspended in RPMI 5% FCS, 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol and 2 mM glutamine. Then, 5 \u00d7 104 labeled B cells were cultured with CD40L (R&D Systems) in combination with IL-4 and IL-5 (R&D Systems) and in the presence of increasing IL-21 (Peprotech) at the indicated ng ml 1 concentrations. Small molecule inhibitors. In vitro, 5 \u00d7 104 CTV-labeled B cells were cultured with LPS (Sigma) in combination with 50 ng ml1 IL-4 (R&D Systems) in the presence of DMSO or PTC-209 (Sapphire Bioscience) at the indicated concentrations. In vivo, mice were infected with LCMV-Docile and administered with 15 mg kg 1 body weight per mouse of PTC-028 (Sapphire Bioscience) small molecule inhibitor or vehicle control (0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and 1% Tween 80) via oral gavage every 24 h. ATAC sequencing. Briefly, 50,000 cells were pelleted and washed with PBS. One-step permeabilization and tagmentation method was used by resuspending the pellets in Digitonin (EZSolution), Tween-20 (Sigma) buffer. High-molecular-weight tagmented DNA was then removed by incubating samples with a 0.7\u00d7 ratio of Agencourt AMPureXP beads (Invitrogen). The same process was applied using a 1.2\u00d7 ratio of beads to exclude low-molecular-weight DNA. Purified DNA was then pre-amplified with indexed primers and HiFi HotStart Polymerase Ready Mix (KAPA Biosystems). After estimation of addition PCR cycles required 82, the genomic library was fully amplified using the SYBR qPCR Master Mix with primers included in the Illumina Library Quantification kit for Bio-Rad iCycler (KAPA 50-bp paired-end Illumina chemistry. For data processing, reads were aligned to the NCBI37/mm10 build of the Mus musculus genome using Bowtie2 (ref. 83) and PCR duplicate reads were flagged using the Picard MarkDuplicates tool. Enriched accessible regions were determined using MACS2 (ref. 84) and reads overlapping peaks were annotated for each sample using GenomicRanges85 tool in R. DARs were determined using DESeq2 (ref. 86). PCA was performed using the vegan package in R. RNA sequencing. Briefly, 250,000 cells were pelleted and washed with PBS. RNA purification was performed using the RNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN) or Direct-zol RNA Microprep kit (Zymo Research), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total mRNA was quantified with the Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen) and RNA integrity number values were generated for quality assignment by using the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Quality control-assessed libraries were then sequenced at the Illumina NextSeq500. For data processing, reads were aligned to the NCBI37/mm10 build of the M. musculus genome using the Subread aligner. Library counts were obtained using featureCounts and log 2fold change were processed applying the DeSeq2 function. A PCA plot was generated using the PCAplot tool included in the DeSeq2 library. Volcano plot and quality control analysis were acquired using the Degust tool87. K-means analysis and heat maps were carried out using the kmeans and heatmap.2 tools in RStudio. PRC and Myc target analyses plots were generated using information about targets from published datasets 88-93. IP A and GSEA. QIAGEN's IPA software was used for functional pathway analysis of DEGs identified in this study. Analysis was performed using expression cutoff of 0.58-fold and FDR of 0.05. GSEA was performed on unfiltered normalized counts to identify signaling pathway that are differentially activated in GC B cells between acute and chronic infection. Analysis was executed by using the MSigDB collection of the Hallmark gene set covering principal molecular functions. Vh sequencing. Splenocytes from NP-KLH-immunized mice were pooled and single GC B cells were sort-purified into 96-well plates containing PBS on a BD FACSAria equipped with a plate sorter and prepared for sequencing using nested primers for Vh186.2 and C1 as previously described 94. DNA Sanger sequencing was performed by Macrogen, Singapore, using 3 primers from the second round of PCR. Vh186.2 sequences were aligned to germline using IMGT V-Quest and sequences of poor quality, those not identified as Vh186.2, miscalls, incomplete sequences or those containing stop codons were excluded from further analysis. The number and frequency of mutations was identified by comparison to the germline sequence. The number of sequences with the position tgg sequencing. Methods were adapted from previous work 95. Sort-purified bulk GC B cells (B220+IgDloCD38-CD95+CD138) were processed with a NucleoSpin Tissue mini kit for DNA (Macherey-Nagel, 740952), according to manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was pre-amplified for mouse antibody heavy-chain library construction (using primers listed in Supplementary Table 4), amplicons were purified and Illumina NexteraXT adaptors were added to Igh library using Illumina MiSeq V2 chemistry and 251-bp paired-end was performed (Hudson Institute). For data processing, high-throughput BCR data of raw sequences from eight mice along with their metadata were stored, annotated and analyzed with ImmuneDB 96. V and J gene assignment was performed using the Anchoring method97. For clone assignment, sequences in each mouse were divided into bins of common Vh and Jh gene assignment and the same CDR3 length. All of the sequences with 85% or more similarity in their CDR3 amino acids were grouped into the same clone. For mutation analysis, the number of unique mutations per clone were calculated in CDRs and framework regions, defined previously 98. We considered both the overall levels of non-synonymous and synonymous mutations and the overall ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations in each region of each mouse. For selection pressure analysis, the overall selection pressure in CDRs and framework regions was assessed across all clones of each mouse. Selection pressure analysis was performed with BASELINe (Bayesian Estimation of Antigen-driven Selection in Ig Sequences) 99, part of the Shazam Immunoblot. Sort-purified R0278) supplemented with Roche complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 11836170001). Protein lysates Sample Buffer 1610174). Transfer blotting on nitrocellulose membranes was performed (40 min at 90 V). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk. Primary antibodies were: Cell Signaling and histone were anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 111-035-144). H3 controls of samples were run in parallel due to technical limitations of developing both H3 and BMI-1 on the same blot. Membranes were developed using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad, 1705060) and images were taken at the ChemiTouch (Bio-Rad) at different exposure times. Intensity of bands was quantified using the 'lane and bands' tool in Image Lab software (Bio-Rad, one-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the significance of data (GraphPad Prism). Statistical values are ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01 and *P < 0.05. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications 20,101. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. There was no randomization to data collection or organization of experimental conditions. Animals were assigned to experimental groups based on genotype, sex and age matching. Mice assessed to be nonresponders to stimuli were excluded from analyses. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. NATUre IMMUNOLOG y | www.nature.com/natureimmunologyArticles NaTUrE IMMUNologyReporting Summary.

Sample size The minimum sample size for in vivo experiments was determined based on our prior experience with statistical assessment of genetically- modified mice compared to control mice (e.g. Kealy et al Cell Reports 2020; Good-Jacobson et al JEM 2015). The minimum sample size for in vitro experiments was determined based on our prior experience (e.g. Kealy et al Cell Reports 2020). For in vivo and in vitro experiments, a minimum of two independent experiments were performed. For deep-sequencing experiments, a minimum of two independent biological replicates were used. Data exclusions Mice that did not respond to LCMV, likely due to a problem encountered during tail IV injection, were excluded. Mice that did not respond to NP-KLH immunization were excluded. Replication Data were combined from at least two independent experiments, and each experiment has at least two biological replicates. All attempts at replication were successful. Randomization Samples were organized by mouse strain and treatment (immunization, infection). To reduce the covariates, each experiment was designed by matching age range and sex between the different experimental groups. Blinding Blinding was not possible as the mice are tattooed with an identifying number, and are animal ethics protocols dictate monitoring and recording of each animal from infection to experiment. One researcher is responsible for the entirety of the experiment.

Animals and other organisms Policy information about studies involving animals ; ARRIVE guidelines recommended for reporting animal research Laboratory animals All mice are on a C57BL/6 background, back-crossed and maintained at the Monash Animal Research Platform. Strains used: - Cd23cre - - Bmi1CreERRosa26EYFP - Prdm1Rosa26CreERT2 - Bmi1f/fPrdm1Rosa26CreERT2 - Ly5.1 Mice were maintained in housing at a temperature of 18-24oC and a humidity of 40-70%. Light/dark cycle was 12hr per cycle. Both males and females were used for the purposes of this project. Animals used in the experimental procedures were at least 42 days old and up to 6 months of age. Wild animals The study did not involved the use of wild animals. Field-collected samples The study did not involved samples collected from the field. Ethics oversight The Monash Animal Ethics Committee approved all experimental procedures on the laboratory animals. Animal care and experimentation were conducted following the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes guidelines. Note that full information on the approval of the study protocol must also be provided in the manuscript. Flow Cytometry Plots Confirm that: The axis labels state the marker and fluorochrome used (e.g. CD4-FITC). The axis scales are clearly visible. Include numbers along axes only for bottom left plot of group (a 'group' is an analysis of identical markers). All plots are contour plots with outliers or pseudocolor plots. A numerical value for number of cells or percentage (with statistics) is provided. Methodology Sample preparation Murine spleens were used from the above listed mice for flow cytometric analysis, by using the following method: Mush spleens through strainer with PBS-FCS (pre-chilled degrees Celsius); Rinse strainer and plunger with 2%PBS-FCS; Spin at 1500 rpm for 5 min and discard supernatant; Add 1 ml RBC buffer (per spleen) for 3 min with gentle agitation (pipette up and down with serological pipette to try and break up some clumps or use transfer pipette to get rid of big clumps); Add 9 ml PBS-2% FCS, spin at 1500 rpm for 5 min and discard supernatant (keep everything at 4 degrees Celsius) Resuspend in PBS-2%FCS, filter through mesh (to get rid of clumps) and perform cell count; Add 5 million cells per FACS tube and wash again, aspirate off supernatant for a dry pellet; Cells are then ready for viability stain and stained with anti-mouse antibodies as described in the methods. 4 nature research | reporting summary April 2020 Instrument BD LSRFortessa X-20 for data collection and FlowJo v10.7 for data analysis. Cell population abundance For flow cytometry analysis, a total of 5,000,000 cells (purified splenocytes) per sample was used for staining with the listed antibodies. For cell sorting, depending on the type of experiment, we used to stain at least 20,000,000 cells. A small fraction (usually 20\u00b5l) of the sorted samples was run on the BD LSRFortessa X-20 cell analyzer to check the purity of the sorted population. Our sorted samples showed a frequency of 98-99% purity. Gating strategy For all the samples used in this project, the initial gating strategy was used as follows: 1. Live/Dead cells, by using the BD HorizonTM Fixable Viability Stain (FVS). Positive stained dead cells were excluded from the gate. 2. Single cell gate. This gate was obtained by using FSC-A on the X-axis and FSC-H on the Y-axis. The cells laying on the diagonal, representing the single cell population, were gated. 3. Lymphocytes. This population is gated by using FSC-A on the X-axis and SSC-A on the Y-axis. Example downstream gating strategies are shown in Supplementary Information. The various cell populations described in the paper were gated by using the antibodies listed in the Supplementary Information. Each antibody was previously tested to discriminate between the negative and positive population. To do so, each antibody was serially diluted and used to stain the same number of splenocytes (5x10^6). The titer of each antibody was assessed by using the geometric mean analysis of the different dilutions. Tick this box to confirm that a figure exemplifying the gating strategy is provided in the Supplementary Information. "}
