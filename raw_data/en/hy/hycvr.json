I came to see Dr Auth in mid August of 2020 due to extreme lower back and right leg pain. I had been receiving injections in my lower back and hip for over one year. Each time I received an injection the pain came back within a month. My pain management Dr. told me I was going to need spinal surgery. I went to see Dr. Auth because he had treated me over two years earlier for back pain. I remembered him telling me at the time that I would really benefit from the DRS treatment. I decided to try it. It was that or spine surgery! I'm so happy and grateful that Dr Auth and his staff were there for me. I completed 25 sessions of DRS and am now pain free! - C.B.

Understanding your spinal health Throughout your daily activities, your spine supports you while taking on the natural forces of gravity and compression. This stress on your spine caused by everyday life has a cumulative effect, which can cause your spine to be compromised. These activities may include bending, lifting, twisting, sitting, driving, reaching - even something as simple as coughing, sneezing or tying your shoes. The ongoing stress to your spine results in discs becoming damaged, causing them to weaken and tear. When this occurs, the nucleus (soft interior portion) of your disc may push through tears in the outer tissues (annulus), resulting in a disc herniation or a disc bulge. This disc material may directly press on your nerves or cause a chemical irritation creating severe shooting pain, burning pain or numbness and tingling. As you see in the image of the herniated disc, the nucleus is protruding through a tear and is pressing on the nerve. In order to keep the nucleus of your disc intact and functioning correctly, the outer tissues of the discs need to heal. Once this is achieved, your spine returns to more healthy state, your pain subsides, and your life can return to normal. How does the DRS Protocol return your spine to a state of health? The DRS Protocol is both relaxing and comfortable as well as safe and drug-free. The DRS Protocol returns your spine to a state of health by: - increasing the space between your vertebrae - mobilizing spinal joints - relieving and unloading pressure from your spine - reducing irritation on the joints, nerves and discs in your spine - toning underlying musculature - improving circulation and allowing for the diffusion of water, oxygen and nutrients Are you curious to see the DRS Protocol in action?
