Achieving this goal fundamentally requires engineered regulatory elements and circuitry that can be used to program human cell functions by processing complex environmental inputs and mediating precisely regulated expression of therapeutic agents. Towards this goal, synthetic transcriptional programs can interface with sense and response modules to enable new layers of regulation in cells. To advance immune cell therapies beyond reliance on simple constitutive expression of therapeutic agents, there is a need for programmable genetic components that offer tunable and versatile regulatory profiles. Moreover, these components must themselves have properties that are compatible with the human therapeutic context, including high specificity, low immunogenicity, and deliverability. T cell immunotherapy has shown tremendous promise for cancer treatment, including liquid tumors such as leukemia and lymphoma. However, alongside its remarkable effectiveness, there are significant side effects, such as cytokine releasing syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, which pose life-threatening risks to patients receiving immunotherapy. It is increasingly important to develop safe and effective sense-and-response strategies that can control the activity of engineered T cells post-infusion.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The technology described herein is directed to a method to control gene expression. In general, the technology described herein relates to a synthetic transcription factor (synTF) that comprises a regulator protein (RP), where the regulator protein regulates the activity of the synTF. In particular, the synTFs according to the methods, systems and compositions as disclosed herein comprise (i) a DNA binding domain (DBD) which binds to a target nucleic acid sequence (or target DNA binding motif (DBM)) located 3 of a promoter that is operatively linked to the nucleic acid of a gene of interest (GOI) to be expressed, (ii) an effector domain (ED) and a regulator protein (RP), where the regulator protein controls the coupling of the DNA binding domain (DBD) with the effector domain (ED), or controls the cellular localization of the ED, such that when the ED and DBD are attached and/or located in the nucleus, the ED can function to recruit or repress translation machinery to the promoter to regulate gene expression of a gene of interest. In some embodiments, the ED can be a transcriptional activator (TA), thereby turning on gene expression when the ED is present at the transcription start site of a gene of interest, and in some embodiments, the ED is a transcriptional repressor (TR), such that when the ED is present at the transcription start site of a gene of interest, the gene expression is inhibited or repressed. In some embodiments of the systems, compositions and methods as disclosed herein, the regulator protein of the SynTF is selected from a protease, a pair of inducible proximity domains (IPDs) or a translocation domain (i.e., a cytosolic sequestering protein), each of which are described herein and in more detail below. In some embodiments of the systems, compositions and methods as disclosed herein, the synTF comprises a regulator protein that is a self-cleaving protease, for example, one exemplary protease is NS3. SynTFs comprising self-cleaving proteases as \"repressible proteases SynTF\". In such embodiments of the systems, compositions and methods disclosed herein, the DBD is directly linked or indirectly linked (or coupled) to the effector domain, and the protease regulator protein (typically located between the DBD and ED) controls the coupling of the DBD to the ED. In such an embodiment, in the presence of an agent which inhibits the regulator protein (i.e., NS3 protein), the DBD and ED remain coupled or intact (either directly or indirectly) and the effector domain can control gene expression from the promoter (i.e., turning on gene expression of the gene of interest (GOI) if the ED is a TA, or repressing gene expression if the ED is a TR) (see e.g., In another embodiment of the systems, compositions and methods as disclosed herein, the synTF comprises a regulator protein that is a pair of inducer proximity domains (referred to as an \"IPD pair\") which is located between the DBD and ED, where each domain of the IPD come together in the presence of an inducer agent, and therefore linking the DBD and ED and controlling gene expression (see, e.g., In some embodiments of the systems, compositions and methods as disclosed herein, the synTF comprises a regulator protein that is a translocation domain. In some embodiments, a translocation domain is a cytosolic sequestering protein, for example, one exemplary cytosolic sequestering protein is ERT2 and variants thereof. SynTFs comprising a translocation domain, e.g., a cytosolic sequestering protein can also be referred to herein as \"Translocation Domain SynTF\". In such embodiments of the systems, compositions and methods disclosed herein, the DBD is directly linked or indirectly linked (or coupled) to the effector domain, and the translocation domain, e.g., a cytosolic sequestering protein regulator protein (which can be attached to either to the ED, or DBD or located between the DBD and ED) controls the cellular localization of the synTF comprising the DBD-ED (see, e.g., Another aspect of the systems, compositions and methods as disclosed herein are synTFs comprising a small-molecule assisted shutoff (SMASh) domain, which can also be referred to herein as an \"induced degradation domain.\" In general, SMASh domains function to target the polypeptide that is attached to the SMASh domain for degradation. In some embodiments, the SMASh domain is attached to a synTF comprising a regulator protein that is an inducer proximity domain pair (IPD), or a cytosolic sequestering protein (e.g., see In all aspects of the methods, systems and compositions disclosed herein, a SMASh domain comprises a self-cleaving protease and a degron domain. In some embodiments, the self-cleaving protease is a NS3 protease or variant thereof as disclosed herein. In some embodiments the SMASh domain comprises NS3 protease domain a partial NS3 helical domain and NS4A domain, and can be fused to the N-terminal or C-terminal of a synTF described herein. Without being limited to theory and by way of explanation only, when a SMASh domain is attached to a synTF as disclosed herein, and when there is an inhibitor of the SMASh domain self-cleaving protease present, both the SMASh domain and the attached synTF are targeted for degradation. This is referred to as \"SynTF-degradation\" and results in the synTF being \"SynTF-OFF\"\u2014that is because the synTF is degraded, the synTF cannot bind to the DBM, or regulate the expression of the gene of interest, regardless of the type of effector domain present in the synTF. Conversely, when an inhibitor of the self-cleaving protease is absent, the self-cleaving protease cleaves (or uncouples) the SMASh domain from the synTF, and only the SMASh domain is targeted for degradation, and the activity of the released synTF is regulated by way of the regulator protein. As such, when a SMASh domain is attached to the synTF, in the absence of the protease inhibitor, it is referred to \"SMASh-degradation\" and results in the synTF being \"SynTF-ON\" enabling the synTF to be regulated by the regulator protein, and gene expression can occur or be repressed depending on whether the ED is a transcription activator or repressor protein, respectively. Accordingly, the presence of a SMASh domain attached to the synTF enables a second level of control for the expression of the GOI in addition to the regulator protein. In some embodiments, the SMASh domain by itself serves as the regulator protein of a synTF (i.e., SMASh domain replaces a self-cleaving protease regulator protein), and is referred to as an Induced Degradation Domain SynTF (e.g., see In some embodiments, where the SMASh domain is attached to translocation domain synTF (e.g., where the regulator protein is a sequestering protein), or a heterodimerization domain synTF (i.e., where the regulator protein is pair of inducible proximity domains (IPD pair)), the SMASH domain can be referred to as a \"SMASh tag\" and can be attached to the C-terminal or N-terminal of a synTF (see, e.g., Another aspect of the technology disclosed herein relates to a system for controlling gene expression of a gene of interest (GOI), where the system comprises a synTF described herein and a nucleic acid construct comprising the elements that the synTF binds to regulate gene expression. In particular, in some aspects, the system comprising (i) at least one synthetic transcription factor (synTF) as disclosed herein, and (ii) at least a nucleic acid construct, where the synTF comprises at least one DNA binding domain (DBD), a transcriptional effector domain (ED), and at least one regulator protein (RP), and where the ED is directly or indirectly coupled or linked to the DBD, and where the coupling is regulated by the at least one RP, or wherein the cellular localization of the ED linked to the DBD is regulated by the at least one RP, and where the at least one RP is regulated by an RP inducer, where the DBD can bind to a target DNA binding motif (DBM) located upstream of a promoter operatively linked to a gene, and where the nucleic acid construct comprises (i) at least one target DNA binding motif (DBM) comprising a target nucleic acid for binding of the at least one DBD of the synTF, and (ii) a promoter sequence located 3 of the at least one DBM, and (iii) a gene of interest (GOI) operatively linked to the promoter sequence. In some embodiments where the regulator protein of the synTFs regulates the coupling of the ED to the DBD (e.g., protease domain synTF or induced proximity domain synTFs), in the presence of the RP inducer, the coupling of the ED to the DBD of the synTF is maintained, enabling the ED to be in proximity to the promoter sequence when the DBD binds to the DNA binding motif (DBM), where the ED controls the expression of the gene of interest (\"ED-on\"). In embodiments where the ED is a transcriptional activator (TA), it results in turning on gene expression (\"TA-on\" (expression)), whereas in embodiments where the ED is a transcriptional repressor protein (TR), it inhibits or represses gene expression (\"TR-on\" (no expression)). In contrast, where the RP inducer is absent, the coupling of the ED to the DBD of the synTF is severed, preventing the ED from being in proximity to the promoter sequence when the DBD binds to the DNA binding motif (DBM), preventing gene expression of the gene of interest (\"ED-off\"). In embodiments where the ED is a transcriptional activator (TA), it results in turning off the gene expression (\"TA-off\" (no expression)), whereas in embodiments there the ED is a transcriptional repressor protein (TR), it turns on gene expression (\"TR-off\"/Repression-off, therefore enabling gene expression). In embodiments where the regulator protein of the synTF regulates the cellular localization of the synTF (DBD and linked ED), when an RP inducer is present, the ED coupled to the DBD of the synTF is not sequestered in the cytosol, enabling the DBD to bind to the DNA binding motif (DBM) and enabling the transcriptional effector domain (ED) to be in proximity to the promoter sequence to control the expression of the gene of interest (\"ED-on\"). In embodiments where the ED is a transcriptional activator (TA), it results in turning on gene expression (\"TA-on\" (expression)), whereas in embodiments where the ED is a transcriptional repressor protein (TR), it inhibits or represses gene expression (\"TR-on\" (no expression)). Moreover, when the RP inducer is absent, the ED coupled to the DBD of the synTF is sequestered in the cytosol, preventing the DBD of the synTF from binding to the DBM, and preventing the effector domain (ED) from being in proximity to the promoter sequence, preventing expression of the gene of interest (\"ED-off\"). In embodiments where the ED is a transcriptional activator (TA), it results in turning off the gene expression (\"TA-off\" (no expression)), whereas in embodiments where the ED is a transcriptional repressor protein (TR), it turns on gene expression (\"TR-off\"/Repression-off, therefore enabling gene expression). Accordingly, whether gene expression of the GOI occurs is dependent on 3 levels of control, including but not limited to; (i) the type of regulator protein in the synTF, (ii) the presence or absence of a regulator protein inducer (RP inducer), and (iii) the type of effector domain. Moreover, in some embodiments, the system for controlling gene expression can be configured for an additional level of control for the gene expression, depending whether there is a SMASh domain attached to the synTF, as disclosed herein. For example, attachment of a SMASh domain to a synTF will result in the following outcomes: if an inhibitor to the SMASh protease is present, the SMASh protease activity is inhibited, resulting in the synTF being degraded (\"Syn-degradation\") and preventing the DBD of the synTF binding to the DBM and controlling the expression or repression of the gene of interest (\"synTF-degradation\"; TA-off (no expression), TR-off (yes-expression). In alternative embodiments, if an inhibitor to the SMASh protease is absent, the SMASh protease is active and self cleaves/uncouples from the synTF, resulting the SMASh domain being targeted for degradation and allowing the DBD of the synTF to bind to the DBM and the ED of synTF to control the expression of the gene of interest (\"SMASh-degradation, TA-on (yes-expression), TR-on (no-expression). Other aspects of the technology described herein relate to a cell comprising the nucleic acid sequences as disclosed herein for binding of the synTF to regulate the expression of the gene of interest, and also a nucleic acid encoding the synthetic transcription factor. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequences are on separate constructs, and in some embodiments, they are the same construct, as disclosed herein and referred to as a \"single vector\". Other embodiments will become readily apparent from the disclosure. Aspects of the present invention teach certain benefits in construction and use which give rise to the exemplary advantages described below. Other features and advantages of aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following more detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of aspects of the invention. The following abbreviations used herein are defined as follows: synTF (synthetic fluorescent protein); TPM (transcripts per million; i.e., a normalized value of each individual RNA transcript across the total pool of RNA transcripts for the sequenced samples); ABI 4OHT SMASh (small molecule assisted shut-off); units relative emission intensity); IL-2 (interleukin focus forming use in the methods and compositions as disclosed herein, where the synTFs comprise (i) a DNA binding domain (DBD) which binds to a target nucleic acid sequence (or target DNA binding motif (DBM)), (ii) an effector domain (ED) and a regulator protein (RP), where the regulator protein controls the coupling or linkage of the DNA binding domain (DBD) with the effector domain (ED) (such coupling can also be referred to as a \"mediator domain\"), or controls the cellular localization of the ED, such that when the ED and DBD are attached and/or located in the nucleus, the ED can function to recruit or repress translation machinery to the promoter to regulate gene expression of a gene of interest. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, regulator proteins can be activated or inhibited by to a variety of inputs, non-limiting examples of which include: inducers (e.g., small molecules), light-inducible control (e.g., dimerization, assembly, localization), temperature, pH, phosphorylation, oxygen, lipid, magnetic, electric, spatial mechanisms (e.g., intracellular and/or extracellular; e.g., synthetic receptors and/or soluble factors), endogenous ligands (e.g., biomarkers), cell-cycle state, native signaling pathways, or disease and/or pathogenic states (e.g., aggregation, infection). In some embodiments of the systems, compositions and methods as disclosed herein, the regulator protein of the SynTF is selected from a protease, a pair of inducible proximity domains (IPDs), a translocation domain (i.e., a cytosolic sequestering protein), or an induced degradation domain, each of which are described herein and in more detail below. Described herein are four general frameworks of inducible or drug-controllable synthetic transcription factors: (1) a synTF comprising repressible protease, referred to as a repressible protease synTF; (2) a synTF comprising induced proximity domains, referred to as a induced proximity domain SynTF; (3) a synTF system comprising a cytosolic sequestering domain, referred to as a cytosolic sequestering synTF; and (4) a synTF comprising an induced degradation domain referred to as an induced degradation domain synTF. Also described herein are polynucleotides and vector encoding said synTF polypeptides, cells expressing said synTF polypeptides, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said synTF polypeptides, and methods of using said synTF polypeptides. Described herein is a class of engineered transcription factor proteins (synTFs) and corresponding responsive artificial engineered promoters capable of precisely controlling gene expression in a wide range of eukaryotic cells and organisms, including mammalian cells. These synTFs are specifically designed to have reduced or minimal binding potential in the host genome (i.e., \"orthogonal\" activity to the host genome). The synTF proteins described herein comprise a DNA binding domain (DBD) which are based on engineered zinc finger (ZF) arrays that are designed to target and bind specific 18-20 nucleotide sequences that are distant and different from the host genome sequences, when the synTF proteins are used in the selected hosts. This strategy limits non-specific interactions of the synTF proteins with the host's genome; such non-specific interactions are not ideal and therefore, are not desired. The synTFs described herein are designed, in some aspects, according to the following parameters: (1) targetable DNA sequences (also known as ZF binding sites) are identified for the ZF arrays that are specifically designed to have reduced binding potential in a host genome; (2) ZF arrays are designed and assembled; (3) synTFs are designed by coupling engineered (i.e., ZF arrays to transcriptional and/or epigenetic effector domains; (4) corresponding responsive promoters are designed by placing instances of the targetable DNA sequences (i.e., ZF binding sites) upstream of constitutive promoters. The targetable DNA sequences are operably linked to the promoters such that the occupancy of synTFs on the targetable DNA sequences regulates the activity of the promoter in gene expression. The combination of a synTFs and a targetable DNA sequence-promoter forms a unique expression system that is artificial, scalable, and regulatable, for the expressions of desired genes placed within the expression systems, with no or minimal effects on the expression of endogenous genes, meaning no or minimal off-site gene regulation of endogenous genes. The synTFs described herein have reduced or minimal functional binding potential in the host genome, which provides, in part, advantages of no or minimal off-site DNA targeting by the synTFs. In addition, the synthetic ZF-based proteins (synTFs) described herein are derived from mammalian protein scaffolds, conferring minimal degree of immunogenicity over other prokaryotically-derived domains. In contrast to other classes of programmable DNA-targeting domains, these zinc-finger-based regulatory proteins are considerably smaller (4-5\u00d7) than TALE and dCas9 proteins, less repetitive than TALE repeat proteins, and are not as constrained by lentiviral packaging limits, enabling convenient packaging in lentiviral delivery constructs and affording space for other desirable control elements.I.

Nos. 10,138,493; 10,590,182; Khalil et al., Cell Volume 150, Issue 3, 3 Aug. 2012, Pages 647-658; Park et al., Cell. 2019 Jan. 10, 176(1-2):227-238, e20; Yeo et al., Nature Methods volume 15, pages 611-616(2018); Bintu et al., Science. 2016 Feb. 12; 351(6274): 720-724; the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the TR comprises KRAB, or a functional fragment thereof. The Kr\u00fcppel associated box (KRAB) domain is a category of transcriptional repression domains present in approximately 400 human zinc finger protein-based transcription factors (KRAB zinc finger proteins), and it associates with other chromatin regulators that write or read H3K9me3. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the TR comprises KRAB-MeCP2, a bipartite repressor domain.

In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the TR comprises a Hp1a repressor domain, or a functional fragment thereof. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1a in Drosophila) is a conserved eukaryotic chromosomal protein that is prominently associated with pericentric heterochromatin and mediates the concomitant gene silencing. HP1a binds H3K9me2/3 through its chromo domain, and binds histone methylates histone H3 K9, through its chromo shadow domain. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the Hp1a repressor domain comprises SEQ ID NO: 98 or a polypeptide comprising a sequence that is at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to SEQ ID NO: 98, that maintains its function. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the TR comprises an EED repressor domain, or a functional fragment thereof. EED (Embryonic Ectoderm Development) functions as part of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which methylates histone 27 (H3K27me3). Polycomb family members form multimeric protein complexes, which are involved in maintaining the transcriptional repressive state of genes over successive cell generations. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the EED repressor domain comprises SEQ ID NO: 99 or a polypeptide comprising a sequence that is at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to SEQ ID NO: 99, that maintains its function.

In another embodiment of any aspect described herein, in the synTF described or the ZF-containing fusion protein described herein, the transcriptional effector domain is an epigenetic effector domain. For example, at least one ZF protein domain is fused to one or more chromatin regulating enzymes that (1) catalyze chemical modifications of DNA or histone residues (e.g. DNA methyltransferases, histone methyltransferases, histone acetyltransferases) or (2) remove di-oxygenases, DNA hydroxylases, catalyzes the transfer of methyl group to cytosine, which typically results in transcriptional repression through the recruitment of repressive regulatory proteins. Another example is CBP/p300 histone acetyltransferase, which is typically associated with transcriptional activation through the interactions with multiple transcription factors. Related epigenetic effector domains associated with the deposition of biochemical marks DNA or domains associated with the removal of biochemical marks from DNA or histone residue(s) include synTFs comprising at least one DNA-binding domain (DBD). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a synTF polypeptide as described herein (or a synTF polypeptide system collectively) comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more DBD(s). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF polypeptide or system comprises one DBD. In embodiments comprising multiple DBDs, the multiple DBDs can be different individual DBDs or multiple copies of the same DBDs, or a combination of the foregoing. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the at least one DBD is an engineered zinc finger (ZF) binding domain. A zinc finger (ZF) is a finger-shaped fold in a protein that permits it to interact with nucleic acid sequences such as DNA and RNA. Such a fold is well known in the art. The fold is created by the binding of specific amino acids in the protein to a zinc atom. Zinc-finger containing proteins (also known as ZF proteins) can regulate the expression of genes as well as nucleic acid recognition, reverse transcription and virus assembly. A ZF is a relatively small polypeptide domain comprising approximately 30 amino acids, which folds to form an -helix adjacent an antiparallel -sheet (known as a -fold). The fold is stabilized by the co-ordination of a zinc ion between four largely invariant (depending on zinc finger framework type) Cys and/or His residues, as described further below. Natural zinc finger domains have been well studied and described in the literature, see for example, Miller et al., (1985) EMBO J. 4: 1609-1614; Berg (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 99-102; Lee et al., (1989) Science 245: 635-637. A ZF domain recognizes and binds to a nucleic acid triplet, or an overlapping quadruplet (as explained below), in a double-stranded DNA target sequence. However, ZFs are also known to bind RNA and proteins (Clemens, K. R. et al. (1993) Science 260: 530-533; Bogenhagen, D. F. (1993) Mol. Cell. Biol. 301: 47-60; Mackay, J. Sci. 23: 1-4). In domain\" (ZF domain) refers to an individual \"finger\", which comprises a beta-beta-alpha ()-protein fold stabilized by a zinc ion as described elsewhere herein. The Zn-coordinated protein fold produces a finger-like protrusion, a \"finger.\" Each ZF motif typically includes approximately 30 amino acids. The term \"motif\" as used herein refers to a structural motif. The ZF motif is a supersecondary structure having the -fold that stabilized by a zinc ion. In one embodiment, the term \"ZF motif\" according to its ordinary usage in the art, refers to a discrete continuous part of the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide that can be equated with a particular function. ZF motifs are largely structurally independent and may retain their structure and function in different environments. Because the ZF motifs are structurally and functionally independent, the motifs also qualify as domains, thus are often referred as ZF domains. Therefore, ZF domains are protein motifs that contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Typically, a ZF domain binds a triplet or (overlapping) quadruplet nucleotide sequence. Adjacent ZF domains arranged in tandem are joined together by linker sequences to form an array. A ZF peptide typically contains a ZF array and is composed of a plurality of \"ZF domains\", which in combination do not exist in nature. Therefore, they are considered to be artificial or synthetic ZF peptides or proteins. C2H2 zinc fingers (C2H2\u2014ZFs) are the most prevalent type of vertebrate DNA-binding domain, and typically appear in tandem arrays (ZFAs), with sequential C2H2\u2014ZFs each contacting three (or more) sequential bases. C2H2\u2014ZFs can be assembled in a modular fashion. Given a set of modules with defined three-base specificities, modular assembly also presents a way to construct artificial proteins with specific DNA-binding preferences. ZF-containing proteins generally contain strings or chains of ZF motifs, forming an array of ZF (ZFA). Thus, a natural ZF protein may include 2 or more ZF, i.e., a ZFA consisting of 2 or more ZF motifs, which may be directly adjacent one another (i.e. separated by a short (canonical) linker sequence), or may be separated by longer, flexible or structured polypeptide sequences. Directly adjacent ZF domains are expected to bind to contiguous nucleic acid sequences, i.e. to adjacent trinucleotides/triplets. In some cases cross-binding may also occur between adjacent ZF and their respective target triplets, which helps to strengthen or enhance the recognition of the target sequence, and leads to the binding of overlapping quadruplet sequences (Isalan et al., (1997) Proc. 94: 5617-5621). By comparison, distant ZF domains within the same protein may recognize (or bind to) non-contiguous nucleic acid sequences or even to different molecules (e.g. protein rather than nucleic acid). Engineered ZF-containing proteins are chimeric proteins composed of a DNA-binding zinc finger protein domain (ZF protein domain) and another domain through which the protein exerts its effect (effector domain). The effector domain may be a transcriptional activator repressor, a methylation domain or a nuclease. DNA-binding ZF protein domain would contain engineered zinc finger arrays (ZFAs). See e.g., Khalil et al., Cell Volume 150, Issue 3, 3 Aug. 2012, Pages 647-658; U.S. Pat. No. 10,138,493; US Patent Application US20200002710A1; the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Engineered ZF-containing proteins are non-natural and suitably contain 3 or more, for example, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 or more (e.g. up to approximately 30 or 32) ZF motifs arranged adjacent one another in tandem, forming arrays of ZF motifs or ZFA. Particularly ZF-containing synTF proteins (ZF-containing synTF fusion protein, or simply synTF) of the disclosure include at least 3 ZF, at least 4 ZF motifs, at least 5 ZF motifs, or at least 6 ZF motifs, at least 7 ZF motifs, at least 8 ZF motifs, at least 9 ZF motifs, at least 10 ZF motifs, at least 11 or at least 12 ZF motifs; and in some cases at least 18 ZF motifs. In other embodiments, the ZF synTF contains up to 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30, 34, 35, 36, 40, 41, 42, 46, 47, 48, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, or 60 ZF motifs. In some embodiments, the ZF array comprises 1 or more ZF motif. The ZF-containing synTF of the disclosure bind to contiguous orthogonal target nucleic acid binding sites. That is, the ZFs or ZFAs comprising in the ZF domain of the fusion protein binds orthogonal target nucleic acid sequences. In one embodiment, as synthetic transcription factor\" or synTF\" or \"synTF\" refers to an engineered ZF-containing chimeric protein having at least one of the following characteristics and may have more than one: bind target orthogonal specific DNA sequences and have, for example, reduced or minimal functional binding potential in a host eukaryotic genome; are derived from mammalian protein scaffolds, conferring minimal degree of immunogenicity over other prokaryotically-derived domains; and can be packaging in viral delivery systems, such as lentiviral delivery constructs. In another embodiment, as used herein, the term \"engineered synthetic transcription \"engineered synTF,\" abbreviated as \"synTF\" or \"ZF synTF,\" refers to an engineered ZF containing synthetic transcription factor that is a polypeptide, in other words, a ZF-containing synthetic transcription factor protein. These synTFs contain ZF arrays (ZFA) therein for binding to specific target nucleic acid sequences. The synTF is a chimeric, fusion protein that comprises a DNA-binding, ZF-containing protein domain and an effector domain through which the synTF exerts its effect on gene expression. These synTFs can modulate gene expression, wherein the modulation is by increasing or decreasing the expression of a gene that is operably linked to a promoter that is also operably linked to the specific target nucleic acid sequence to which the DNA-binding, ZF-containing protein domain of the synTF binds. As used herein, the term \"ZF array,\" abbreviated as \"ZFA\" refers to an array, or a string, or a chain of ZF motifs arranged in tandem. A ZFA can have six ZF motifs (a 6-finger ZFA), seven ZF motifs is a nucleic acid construct containing a promoter sequence that has at least one orthogonal DNA target sequence operably linked upstream of the promoter sequence such that the orthogonal DNA target sequence confer a responsive property to the promoter when the orthogonal DNA target sequence is bound by its respective transcription factor, the responsive property being whether gene transcription initiation from that promoter is enhanced or repressed when the upstream nearby orthogonal DNA target sequences are bound by a ZF-containing synthetic transcription factor. There may be more than one orthogonal DNA target sequence operably linked upstream of the promoter sequence. When there is one orthogonal DNA target sequence, the promoter is referred to a \"1\u00d7\" promoter, where the \"1\u00d7\" refers to the number of orthogonal DNA target sequence present in the promoter construct. For example, a 4\u00d7 responsive promoter would be identified as having four orthogonal DNA target sequences in the engineered response promoter construct, and the four orthogonal DNA target sequences are upstream of the promoter sequence. The ZF protein domain is modular in design, with zinc finger arrays (ZFA) as the main components, and each ZFA is made of 6-8 ZF motifs. The ZF protein domain comprises at least one ZFA, and can contain as many as up to ten ZFA. The ZF protein domain can have one and up to ten ZFA. The design of the synTF or any engineered fusion protein described herein is also modular, meaning the synTF is made up of modules of ZF domains modules of modules are covalently conjugated together as described herein, and the individual modules function independently of each other. The number of ZFA can range from one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and up to ten. When there are two or more ZFA, the ZFAs are covalently conjugated to each other in tandem, e.g., by a L1 peptide linker, in an NH2\u2014 to COOH\u2014 terminus arrangement to form an array of ZFA. The ZFAs, as a whole, forms the ZF protein domain, is covalently linked to the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the effector domain or the regulator protein. When there are two or more ZFAs present in the ZF protein domain of a synTF or a ZF containing fusion protein described herein, the ZFAs can be the same, or different. Each modular ZFA in the ZF protein domain of a synTF disclosed herein or a ZF containing fusion protein described herein is comprised of six to eight ZF motifs. See In another embodiment of any aspect described herein, the ZF motif comprises a peptide of formula 2: [X3CX2CX5-(helix)-HX3H] (SEQ ID NO: 220) wherein X is any amino acid, the subscript numbers indicate the possible number of amino acid residues, C is cysteine, H is histidine, and (helix) is a-six (or seven) contiguous amino acid residue peptide that forms a short alpha helix. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the ZFA in the ZF protein domain of a synTF comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of a sequence: N-[(formula 2)-L2]6-8-C, where the subscript 6-8 indicates the L2 is a linker peptide having 4-6 amino acid residues, and the N- and C- indicates the N-terminus and C-terminus respectively of the peptide sequence. For example, for a ZFA consists essentially of six ZF motifs, described herein, for a single ZFA is the ZF protein domain of a synTF disclosed herein, the ZFA in the ZF protein domain comprises, consists essentially of, or consists the (Helix) is a-six (or seven) contiguous amino acid residue peptide that forms a short alpha helix and can also be represented as plain text \"xxxxxxx\".

In one embodiment, all six of the helix 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are distinct and different from each other. In another embodiment, all six of the helix 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are identical to each other. Alternatively, at least two of the six helices are identical and the same with each other. In other embodiments, at least three of the six helices in a ZFA are identical and the same with each other, at least four of the six helices in a ZFA are identical and the same with each other, or at least five of the six helices in a ZFA are identical and the same with each other. In some embodiments of any aspect described herein, the helices of the six to eight ZF motifs of an individual ZFA disclosed herein are selected from the six-amino acid (or seven-amino acid) residue peptide sequences disclosed in one of the following Groups 1-11 (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 122-180, 192). In some embodiments, at least four of the ZF motifs in an individual ZFA disclosed herein are selected from the six-amino acid (or seven-amino acid) residue peptide sequences disclosed in one of the following Groups 1-11. In other embodiments, all of the ZF motifs, i.e. the six, seven or eight ZF motifs in an individual ZFA disclosed herein, are selected from the six (or seven) amino acid residue peptide sequences disclosed in one of the following Groups 1-11. In any individual ZFA, the helix selected for a single ZF comprising the ZFA can be repeated twice or more in the ZFA. This means that for any given single ZFA, at least four or all the helices in the ZFA are selected from the same group disclosed herein. For example, wherein a ZFA consists essentially of six ZF motifs, that means there are six alpha helices. All the 6-8 helices (Helix 1; Helix 6; Helix 7; Helix 8) of the ZFs in an individual ZFA is selected from one of the following group 1-11, for example, all six helices are selected from group 2. That is, all the helices for all the ZF comprising a single ZFA come from the same group. Alternatively, at least four of the six helices are selected from the same group, a group selected from group 1-11. For example, four of the six helices are selected from group 5, and the reminder two helices of the six-ZF motif ZFA are selected from the other groups 1-4, 6-11, or can be any other helices that would form a short alpha helix.

According to the N-end rule, newly cleaved polypeptides comprising the amino acid His, Tyr, Gln, Asp, Asn, Phe, Leu, Trp, Lys, or Arg at the N-terminus exhibit a high degradation rate and a short half-life (e.g., 10 minutes or less in yeast; 1-5.5 hours in mammalian reticulocytes). Comparatively, newly cleaved polypeptides comprising the amino acid Val, Met, Gly, Pro, Ala, Ser, Thr, Cys, Ile, or Glu at the N-terminus exhibit a lower degradation rate and a longer half-life (e.g., 30 minutes or more in yeast; 1-100 hours in mammalian reticulocytes). See e.g., Gonda et al., Universality and Structure of the N-end Rule, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 264 (28), pp. 16700-16712, 1989, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Accordingly, in some embodiments of any of the aspects, the resulting amino acid at the N-terminus of a newly cleaved synTF polypeptide as described His, Phe, Leu, Trp, Lys, or Arg.

In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the TimeSTAMP comprises a repressible protease, at least one protease cleavage site, and a detectable marker. The detectable marker is removed from the synTF immediately after translation by the activity of the repressible protease until the time a protease inhibitor is added, after which newly synthesized synTF polypeptides retain their markers.

In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the repressible protease comprises mutations to increase binding affinity for a specific ligand. As a non-limiting example, NS3aH1 (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 315) comprises four mutations needed for interaction with the ANR peptide (e.g., T42S. Accordingly, in embodiments of any of the aspects, a repressible protease as described herein comprises at least one of the following mutations: A7S, E13L, I35V and T42S, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a synTF polypeptide as described herein is in combination with a protease inhibitor. As used herein, \"in combination with\" refers to two or more substances being present in the same formulation in any molecular or physical arrangement, e.g., in an admixture, in a solution, in a mixture, in a suspension, in a colloid, in an emulsion. The formulation can be a homogeneous or heterogeneous mixture. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the active compound(s) can be comprised by a superstructure, e.g., nanoparticles, liposomes, vectors, cells, scaffolds, or the like, said superstructure is which in solution, mixture, admixture, suspension, etc., with the synTF polypeptide or synTF polypeptide system.

In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF polypeptide is in combination with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more protease inhibitors. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF polypeptide is in combination with one protease inhibitor. In embodiments comprising multiple protease inhibitors, the multiple protease inhibitors can be different individual protease inhibitors or multiple copies of the same protease inhibitor, or a combination of the foregoing. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the protease inhibitor is grazoprevir (abbreviated as GZV PubChem CID: 44603531). In some embodiments of of the inhibitor is (DNV; see e.g., PubChem CID: 11285588). embodiments of any of the the protease inhibitor is an approved NS3 protease inhibitor, NS3 protease inhibitors are listed in Table 16 (see e.g., McCauley and Rudd, Hepatitis C virus NS3/4a protease inhibitors, Current Opinion in Pharmacology 2016, 30:84-92; the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In several aspects, described herein are synTF polypeptides comprising a degron domain. As used herein, the term \"degron domain\" refers to a sequence that promotes degradation of an attached protein, e.g., through the proteasome or autophagy-lysosome pathways; in some embodiments of any of aspects, the terms \"degron\", \"degradation domain\" and \"degradation domain\" In some embodiments, a degron domain is a polypeptide that destabilize a protein such that half-life of the protein is reduced at least two-fold, when fused to the protein. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a synTF polypeptide as described herein (or a synTF polypeptide system collectively) comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more degron domains. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF polypeptide or system comprises one degron domain. In embodiments comprising multiple degron domains, the multiple degron domains can be different individual degron domains or multiple copies of the same degron domain, or a combination of the foregoing. Many different degron sequences/signals (e.g., of the ubiquitin-proteasome system) have been described, any of which can be used as provided herein. A degron domain may be operably linked to a cell receptor, but need not be contiguous or immediately adjacent with it as long as the degron domain still functions to direct degradation of the cell receptor. In some embodiments, the degron domain induces rapid degradation of the cell receptor. For a discussion of degron domains and their function in protein degradation, see, e.g., Kanemaki et al. (2013) Pflugers Arch. Biochim al. (2008) Nat. Rev. Tasaki et al. (2007) Trends 32(11):520-528, Meinnel et al. (2006) Biol. 14(3): 1268-1278; Chassin et al., Nature Natsume and Kanemaki Annu Rev Genet. 2017 Nov. 27,51:83-102; the contents of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron domain comprises a ubiquitin tag, including the aspects, the degron domain comprises a self-excising degron, which refers to a complex comprising a repressible protease, a protease cleavage site, and a degron domain. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron domain is a conditional degron domain, wherein the degradation is induced by ligands (e.g., a degron stabilizer) or another input such as temperature shift or a specific wave length of light. Non-limiting examples of conditional degron domains include the induced by NSlmb-vhhGFP expression); or split ubiquitin for the rescue of function (SURF; e.g., induced by rapamycin). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron domain is the E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) degron. The eDHFR degron permits extensive depletion of exogenously expressed proteins in mammalian cells and C. elegans. The eDHFR degron is stabilized by tight binding to the antibiotic and degron stabilizer trimethoprim (TMP), shown below, which is innocuous in eukaryotic cells. Proteins tagged with eDHFR are constitutively degraded unless the cells are exposed to TMP. The level of tagged protein can be directly controlled by modulating the TMP concentration in the growth medium. Unlike shRNA methods this degron-based strategy is advantageous since depletion kinetics are not limited by the natural protein half-life, which allows for more rapid knockdown of stable proteins. TMP stabilizes the DD-target protein fusion in a dose-dependent manner up to 100-fold, which gives the system a substantial dynamic range. The ligand TMP works by itself and does not require dimerization with a second protein. This system is so effective that it can control the levels of transmembrane proteins, such as the synTF polypeptides described herein; see e.g., Schrader et al., Chem Biol. 2010 Sep. 24, 17(9): 917-918; Ryan M. Sheridan and David L. Bentley, Biotechniques. 2016, 60(2): 69-74; Iwamoto et al., Chem Biol. 2010 Sep. 24; 17(9):981-8. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron domain comprises an amino acid sequence derived from an FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP12) (UniProtKB-P62942 (FKB1A_HUMAN), incorporated herein by reference), or a variant thereof. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the FKBP12 derived amino acid sequence comprises a mutation of the phenylalanine (F) at amino acid position 36 (as counted without the methionine) to valine (V) (F36V) (also referred to as FKBP12* or FKBP*). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron stabilizer is a rapamycin analog, such as Sheild-1, shown below. See e.g., Banaszynski et al., Cell. 2006 Sep. 8; 126(5): 995-1004; US Patent Application US20180179522; U.S. Pat. No. 10,137,180; the content of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron domain of a synTF polypeptide as described herein comprises SEQ ID NOs: 317 or 318, or an amino acid sequence that is at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 317 or 318 that maintains the same function (e.g., degradation, binding to TMP or Shield-1). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the destabilizing degron domain comprises at least one mutation that causes almost complete removal or degradation of the synTF polypeptide. Non-limiting examples of thereof; see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 8,173,792, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron domain comprises a ligand-induced degradation (LID) domain. Proteins comprising a LID domain are destabilized and degraded in the presence of a degron destabilizer. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the LID domain of a degron domain can bind to a degron destabilizer, promoting the degradation of the attached protein. The system is reversible and when the degron destabilizer is withdrawn, the protein is not destabilized and/or not degraded. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a synTF polypeptide is bound to a degron destabilizer bound to the degron domain. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF polypeptide is bound specifically to a degron destabilizer bound to the degron domain. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF polypeptide is in combination with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more degron destabilizers. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF polypeptide is in combination with one degron destabilizer. comprising multiple degron destabilizers, destabilizers can be different individual degron destabilizers or multiple copies of the same degron stabilizer, or a combination of the foregoing. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the LID degron domain comprises the FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP), further comprising a degron fused to the C terminus of FKBP, e.g., with an intervening linker such as the 10-amino acid linker (Gly4SerGly4Ser) or another linker as described herein. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron fused to the C terminus of FKBP (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 318) comprises the 19 amino acid sequence: TRGVEEVAEGVVLLRRRGN (SEQ ID NO: 319), or a sequence that is at least 95% identical that maintains the same function. In the absence of the small molecule Shield-1, the 19-aa degron is bound to the FKBP fusion protein, and the protein is stable. When present, Shield-1 binds tightly to FKBP, displacing the 19-aa degron and inducing rapid and processive degradation of the LID domain and any fused partner protein. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron destabilizer is Sheild-1, shown above, or an analog thereof; see e.g., Bonger et al., Nat Chem Biol. 2011 Jul. 3; 7(8):531-7. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron domain comprises an auxin-inducible degradation (AID). Proteins fused to AID (also known as indole-3-acetic acid inducible 17 or AUX/IAA transcriptional regulator family protein) are rapidly degraded. Degradation requires the ectopic expression of the plant F-Box protein TIR1, which recruits proteins tagged with AID in an auxin-dependent manner to the SKP1-CULL-F-Box (SCF) ubiquitin E3 ligases their ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron domain comprises residues 65-133, 65-130, 70-130, or 70-120 of SEQ ID NO: 320. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron domain of a synTF polypeptide as described herein comprises SEQ ID NOs: 320 or 321, or an amino acid sequence that is at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 320 or 321 that maintains the same function. See e.g., Daniel et al., Nat Commun. 2018 Aug. 17; 9(1):3297; the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron domain comprises a modified portion of the NS3 helicase and NS4A. The arrangement of NS3pro and NS4A sequences in the construct creates a functional degron. During HCV replication, the free NS4A N-terminus forms a hydrophobic -helix that is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This N-terminus is created by cleavage of the HCV nonstructural polypeptide at the NS3/4A junction due to its positioning in the protease active site by the NS3 helicase domain. The engineered construct lacks the helicase domain, so NS3/4A cleavage does not occur. The hydrophobic sequences of NS4A, unable to insert into the membrane without a free N-terminus, then exhibit degron-like activity. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 10,550,379; Chung et al., Nat Chem Biol. 2015 September; 11(9): 713-720; the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the degron domain comprises SEQ ID NO: 322, or an amino acid sequence that is at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 322 that maintains the same function. In several aspects, described herein are synTF polypeptides comprising an induced degradation domain, also referred to herein as a self-excising degron or a small molecule-assisted shutoff (SMASh) domain. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the SMASh domain comprises a repressible protease, at least one protease cleavage site, and a degron domain. In the absence the protease inhibitor, the repressible protease cleaves the degron from the synTF, and the synTF is not degraded. In the presence of the protease inhibitor, the repressible protease does not cleave the degron from the synTF, and the degron domain leads to the degradation of the synTF. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a synTF polypeptide as described herein (or a synTF polypeptide system collectively) comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more induced degradation domain(s). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF polypeptide or system comprises one induced degradation domain.

As used herein, the term \"cytosolic sequestering domain\" refers to a domain that influences the subcellular location of the synTF to which it is linked, e.g., through the binding of a ligand. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a synTF polypeptide as described herein (or a synTF polypeptide system collectively) comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more cytosolic sequestering domain(s).

In some embodiments of any of the aspects, cytosolic sequestering protein further comprises a nuclear localization signal (NLS), wherein in the absence of the ligand the NLS is inhibited thereby preventing translocation of the sequestering protein to the nucleus, and wherein in the presence of the ligand the nuclear localization signal is exposed enabling translocation of the sequestering protein to the nucleus. Accordingly, when the ligand is absent, the synTF is sequestered to the cytosol. When the ligand is absent, the synTF is translocated to the nucleus. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the sequestering protein comprises at least a portion of the estrogen receptor (ER). The ER naturally associates with cytoplasmic factors in the cell in the absence of cognate ligands, effectively sequestering itself in the cytoplasm.

See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,112,715; Feil et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Volume 237, Issue 3, 28 Aug. 1997, Pages 752-757; Felker et al., PLoS One. 2016 Apr. 14; 11(4):e0152989; the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their enteritis. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the sequestering protein of the synTF polypeptide is in combination with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more ligands. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the sequestering protein of the synTF polypeptide is in combination with one ligand. In embodiments comprising multiple ligands, the multiple ligands can be different individual ligands or multiple copies of the same ligands, or a combination of the foregoing. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the ligand is estradiol (PubChem CID: 5757), or an analog thereof. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the ligand is a synthetic ligand of the estrogen receptor, such as tamoxifen or a derivative thereof the is selected from: tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT), endoxifen, and Fulvestrant, binding of ligand to the ERT (e.g., ERT2) exposes the NLS and results in nuclear translocation of the ERT.

In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the sequestering protein of the synTF is a transmembrane receptor sequestering protein, and the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and transcriptional effector (TE) domain of the synTF are linked to the cytosolic side of the transmembrane domain of the receptor. In the absence of a specific ligand for the transmembrane protein, the DBD and TA of the synTF are sequestered to the cellular membrane. In the presence of a specific ligand for the transmembrane protein, the transmembrane protein cleaves itself such that the DBD and TA of the synTF are released into the cytosol to be transported to the nucleus. Non-limiting examples of transmembrane receptor sequestering protein include a synthetic notch receptor or first and second exogenous extracellular sensors, described further herein. In some embodiments of any the aspects, the cytosolic sequestering protein comprises a Notch receptor or a variant of endogenous Notch receptor, such as a synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptor.

In the presence of a second member of the specific binding pair, binding of the first member of the specific binding pair to the second member of the specific binding pair induces cleavage of the binding-induced proteolytic cleavage site to activate the intracellular domain, thereby permitting the synTF to translocate to the nucleus. In the absence of a second member of the specific binding pair, the synTF remains sequestered at the cellular membrane. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the sequestering protein comprises one of SEQ ID NOs: 338-339 or an amino acid sequence that is at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to the sequence of one of SEQ ID NOs: 74, 335-337, that maintains the same function.

In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the Notch receptor regulatory region comprises Lin-12 Notch repeats A-C, heterodimerization domains HD-N and a transmembrane domain. In some embodiments of any the aspects, the Notch variant is a Notch receptor where the Notch extracellular subunit (NEC) (which includes the negative regulatory region (NRR)) is partially or completely removed. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the Notch receptor regulatory region is a truncated or modified variant of synNotch, e.g., lacking one or more of the following domains: Lin-12 Notch repeats proteolytic cleavage site, the Notch extracellular domain (NEC), the negative regulatory region (NRR), or a transmembrane domain. Suitable first members of a specific binding pairs (e.g., of the synNotch) include, but are not limited to, antibody-based recognition scaffolds; antibodies (i.e., an antibody-based target of a recognition (e.g., FcRIIIa; FcRIIIb; etc.); an extracellular matrix component; and the like. Specific binding pairs (e.g., of the synNotch) include, e.g., antigen-antibody specific binding pairs, where the first member is an antibody (or antibody-based recognition scaffold) that binds specifically to the second member, which is an antigen, or where the first member is an antigen and the second member is an antibody (or antibody-based recognition scaffold) that binds specifically to the antigen; ligand-receptor specific binding pairs, where the first member is a ligand and the second member is a receptor to which the ligand binds, or where the first member is a receptor, and the second member is a ligand that binds to the receptor; non-antibody-based recognition scaffold-target specific binding pairs, where the first member is a non-antibody-based recognition scaffold and the second member is a target that binds to the non-antibody-based recognition scaffold, or where the first member is a target and the second member is a non-antibody-based recognition scaffold that binds to the target; adhesion molecule-extracellular matrix binding pairs; Fc receptor-Fc binding pairs, where the first member comprises an immunoglobulin Fc that binds to the second member, which is an Fc receptor, or where the first member is an Fc receptor that binds to the second member which comprises an immunoglobulin Fc; and receptor-co-receptor binding pairs, where the first member is a receptor that binds specifically to the second member which is a co-receptor, or where the first member is a co-receptor that binds specifically to the second member which is a receptor. In some embodiments of any the aspects, the transmembrane receptor sequestering protein comprises first and second exogenous extracellular sensors, wherein said first exogenous extracellular sensor comprises: (a) a ligand binding domain, (b) a transmembrane domain, (c) a protease cleavage site, and (d) the DBD and TA of the synTF; and wherein said second exogenous extracellular sensor comprises: (e) a ligand binding domain, (f) a transmembrane domain, and (g) a protease domain. Such a system can also be referred to as a modular extracellular sensor architecture (MESA) system. In the presence of a ligand for the first and second exogenous extracellular sensors, the two receptors are brought into proximity, permitting the protease to cleave the protease cleavage site and release the DBD and TA of the synTF into the cytosol to be translocated to the nucleus. In the absence of a ligand for the first and second exogenous extracellular sensors, the DBD and TA of the synTF remains sequestered at the cell membrane. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the protease comprises any protease as described herein (e.g., NS3), protease cleavage comprises an NS3 protease cleavage site as described herein.

Any type of suitable ligand binding domain (LB) can be employed with transmembrane receptor sequestering protein. Ligand binding domains can, for example, be derived from either an existing receptor ligand-binding domain or from an engineered ligand binding domain. Existing ligand-binding domains could come, for example, from cytokine receptors, chemokine receptors, innate immune receptors (TLRs, etc.), olfactory receptors, steroid and hormone receptors, growth factor receptors, mutant receptors that occur in cancer, neurotransmitter receptors. Engineered ligand-binding domains can be, for example, single-chain antibodies (see scFv constructs discussion below), engineered fibronectin based binding proteins, and engineered consensus-derived binding proteins (e.g., based upon leucine-rich repeats or ankyrin-rich repeats, such as DARPins). The ligand be any cognate ligand of such In several aspects, are synTF least refers to an oligo- or polypeptide region from about 2 to 100 amino acids in length, which links together any of the sequences of the polypeptides as described herein. In some embodiment, linkers can include or be composed of flexible residues such as glycine and serine so that the adjacent protein domains are free to move relative to one another. Longer linkers may be used when it is desirable to ensure that two adjacent domains do not sterically interfere with one another. Linkers may be cleavable or non-cleavable. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a synTF polypeptide as described herein (or a synTF polypeptide system collectively) comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more linker peptide(s). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF polypeptide or system comprises one linker peptide. In embodiments comprising multiple linker peptides, the multiple linker peptides can be different individual linker peptides or multiple copies of the same linker peptide, or a combination of the foregoing. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the linker peptide can be positioned anywhere, between any two domains as described herein: e.g., between the DBD and the regulator protein, between the regulator protein and the effector domain, between the DBD and effector domain, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the linker peptide can be positioned within the DBD, effector domain, or regulator protein, e.g., to link constituents of the domain. In some embodiments of any one aspects described herein, the linkers connect several ZFs to each other in tandem to form a ZF array. In some embodiments of any one aspects described herein, the linker connects a first ZFA with a second ZFA. In some embodiments of any one aspects described herein, the linkers connect several ZFAs to each other to in tandem to form a ZF-containing ZF protein domain. Non-limiting examples of peptide linker the polypeptides described herein include glycine-rich peptide linkers (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,626), wherein more than half of the amino acid residues are glycine. Preferably, such glycine-rich peptide linkers consist of about 20 or fewer amino acids. A linker molecule may also include non-peptide or partial peptide molecules. For instance, the peptides can be linked to peptides or other molecules using well known cross-linking molecules such as glutaraldehyde or EDC (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). In some embodiments of the engineered synTFs described herein, the ZF arrays (ZFAs) in the ZF protein domain of the synTF are joined together in the respective fusion protein with a linker peptide. Non-limiting examples of linker peptide ID 345) ID NO: 323) are used to link regions of a SMASh domain, a StaPL domain, or an NS3/NS4a domain, described further herein. Flexible linkers are generally composed of small, non-polar or polar residues such as Gly, Ser and Thr. In one embodiment of any fusion protein described herein that includes a linker, the linker peptide comprises at least one amino acid that is Gly or Ser. In one embodiment of a fusion protein described herein that includes a linker, the linker is a flexible polypeptide between 1 and 25 residues in length. Common examples of flexible peptide linkers include (GGS)n, where n=1 to 8 ID NO: 352, GGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS), preferably, n=3, 4, 5, 6, that is (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)n (SEQ ID NO: 353), GGGGS, where n indicates the number of repeats of the motif. For example, the flexible linker is (GGS)2 (SEQ ID NO: repeats (Gly-Ser)p where p indicates the number of Gly-Ser repeats of the motif, p=1-8 (SEQ ID NO: 355 GSGSGSGSGSGSGSGS), preferably, n=3, 4, 5, or 6. Another example of a flexible linker is TGSQK (SEQ ID NO: 341). In one the engineered synTFs described herein, wherein the ZF protein domains and effector domains are joined together with a linker peptide, the linker peptide is about 1-20 amino acids long. In one embodiment, the linker peptide does not comprise Lys, or does not comprise, or does not comprise both Lys and Arg. In some embodiments of the engineered synTFs described herein, the ZF protein domains and effector domains are joined together chemical cross-linking agents. Bifunctional cross-linking molecules are linker molecules that possess two distinct reactive sites. For example, one of the reactive sites of a bifunctional linker molecule may be reacted with a functional group on a peptide to form a covalent linkage and the other reactive site may be reacted with a functional group on another molecule to form a covalent linkage. General methods for cross-linking molecules have been reviewed (see, e.g., Means and Feeney, Bioconjugate Chem., 1: 2-12 (1990)). Homobifunctional cross-linker molecules have two reactive sites which are chemically the same.

In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a multi-component synTF system as described herein (e.g., induced proximity synTF system) comprises at least two polypeptides that are physically linked to one another through a self-cleaving peptide domain. The self-cleaving peptide allows the nucleic acids of the first polypeptide and second polypeptide (and/or third polypeptide, etc.) to be present in the same vector, but after translation the self-cleaving peptide cleaves the translated polypeptide into the multiple separate polypeptides. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a synTF polypeptide as described herein (or a synTF polypeptide system collectively) comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more self-cleaving peptides, e.g., in between each synTF polypeptide.

Polynucleotides and Vectors In multiple aspects, described herein are polynucleotides that encode for synTFs.

In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector or nucleic acid described herein is codon-optimized, e.g., the native or wild-type sequence of the nucleic acid sequence has been altered or engineered to include alternative codons such that altered or engineered nucleic acid encodes the same polypeptide expression product as the native/wild-type sequence, but will be transcribed and/or translated at an improved efficiency in a desired expression system. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the expression system is an organism other than the source of the native/wild-type sequence (or a cell obtained from such organism). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector and/or nucleic acid sequence described herein is codon-optimized for expression in a mammal or mammalian cell, e.g., a mouse, a murine cell, or a human cell. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector and/or nucleic acid sequence described herein is codon-optimized for expression in a human cell. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector and/or nucleic acid sequence described herein is codon-optimized for expression in a yeast or yeast cell. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector and/or nucleic acid sequence described herein is codon-optimized for expression in a bacterial cell. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector and/or nucleic acid sequence described herein is codon-optimized for expression in an E. coli cell. In some embodiments, one or more of the genes described herein (e.g., synTF, gene of interest) is expressed in a recombinant expression vector or plasmid. As used herein, the term \"vector\" refers to a polynucleotide sequence suitable for transferring transgenes into a host cell. The term \"vector\" includes plasmids, mini-chromosomes, phage, naked DNA and the like. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,980,285; 5,631,150; 5,707,828; 5,759,828; 5,888,783 and, 5,919,670, and, Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Press (1989). One type of vector is a \"plasmid,\" which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments are ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments are ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"expression vectors\". In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, \"plasmid\" and \"vector\" is used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors, such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions. A cloning vector is one which is able to replicate autonomously or integrated in the genome in a host cell, and which is further characterized by one or more endonuclease restriction sites at which the vector may be cut in a determinable fashion and into which a desired DNA sequence can be ligated such that the new recombinant vector retains its ability to replicate in the host cell. In the case of plasmids, replication of the desired sequence can occur many times as the plasmid increases in copy number within the host cell such as a host bacterium or just a single time per host before the host reproduces by mitosis. In the case of phage, replication can occur actively during a lytic phase or passively during a lysogenic phase. An expression vector is one into which a desired DNA sequence can be inserted by restriction and ligation such that it is operably joined to regulatory sequences, comprising DNA-binding domains as described herein, and can be expressed as an RNA transcript. Vectors can further contain one or more marker sequences suitable for use in the identification of cells which have or have not been transformed or transformed or transfected with the vector. Markers include, for example, genes encoding proteins which increase or decrease either resistance or sensitivity to antibiotics or other compounds, genes which encode enzymes whose activities are detectable by standard assays known in the art (e.g., -galactosidase, luciferase or alkaline phosphatase), and genes which visibly affect the phenotype of transformed or transfected cells, hosts, colonies or plaques (e.g., green fluorescent protein). In certain embodiments, the vectors used herein are capable of autonomous replication and expression of the structural gene products present in the DNA segments to which they are operably joined. As used herein, a coding sequence and regulatory sequences are said to be \"operably\" joined when they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the expression or transcription of the coding sequence under the influence or control of the regulatory sequences. If it is desired that the coding sequences be translated into a functional protein, two DNA sequences are said to be operably joined if induction of a promoter in the 5 regulatory sequences results in the transcription of the coding sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the two DNA sequences does not (1) result in the introduction of a frame-shift mutation, (2) interfere with the ability of the promoter region to direct the transcription of the coding sequences, or (3) interfere with the ability of the corresponding RNA transcript to be translated into a protein. Thus, a promoter region would be operably joined to a coding sequence if the promoter region were capable of effecting transcription of that DNA sequence such that the resulting transcript can be translated into the desired protein or polypeptide. When the nucleic acid molecule that encodes any of the polypeptides described herein is expressed in a cell, a variety of transcription control sequences (e.g., promoter/enhancer sequences) can be used to direct its expression. The promoter can be a native promoter, i.e., the promoter of the gene in its endogenous context, which provides normal regulation of expression of the gene. In some embodiments the promoter can be constitutive, i.e., the promoter is unregulated allowing for continual transcription of its associated gene. A variety of conditional promoters also can be used, such as promoters controlled by the presence or absence of a molecule. The precise nature of the regulatory sequences needed for gene expression can vary between species or cell types, but in general can include, as necessary, 5 non-transcribed and 5 non-translated sequences involved with the initiation of transcription and translation respectively, such as a TATA box, capping sequence, CAAT sequence, and the like. In particular, such 5 non-transcribed regulatory sequences will include a promoter region which includes a promoter sequence for transcriptional control of the operably joined gene. Regulatory sequences can also include enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences as desired. The vectors of the invention may optionally include 5 leader or signal sequences. The choice and design of an appropriate vector is within the ability and discretion of one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the promoter is a eukaryotic or human constitutive promoter, including but not limited to: human elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1alpha, (ACTB) promoter; and the like. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the promoter is a minimal promoter or a core promoter. The minimal or core promoter, by definition, is the sequence located between the 35 to +35 region with respect to transcription start site; the minimal promoter is typically shorter than full promoters, and does not comprise additional elements such as enhancers or silencers. Non-limiting examples of minimal promoters include minCMV; CMV53 (minCMV with the addition of an minSV40 (minimal simian virus 40 promoter); kinase the adenovirus major late promoter); pJB42CAT5 (a minimal promoter derived from the human junB gene); ybTATA (a synthetic minimal promoter), and the TATA box alone. See e.g., Ede et al., ACS Synth Biol. 2016 May 20, 5(5): 395-404; Qin et al., PLoS One. 2010, 5(5): e10611; Norman et al., PLoS One. 2010 Aug. 26, 5(8):e12413; the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 16-27, 58-60, 64) comprises a SFFV promoter (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 363). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 55-57) comprises a full CMV promoter (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 364). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 52-54, 62) comprises a minCMV promoter (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 365). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 61, 63, 64) comprises a minTK promoter (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 366). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector comprises a Kozak sequence (e.g., GCCGCCACC), which is a nucleic acid motif that functions as the protein translation initiation site in eukaryotic mRNA transcripts. Expression vectors containing all the necessary elements for expression are commercially available and known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989. Cells are genetically engineered by the introduction into the cells of heterologous DNA (RNA). That heterologous DNA (RNA) is placed under operable control of transcriptional elements to permit the expression of the heterologous DNA in the host cell. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a synTF vector comprises one of SEQ ID NOs: 16-27 or SEQ ID NOs: 52-64 (see e.g., Tables 1 or 2) or a sequence that is at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to the sequence of one of SEQ ID NOs: 236-261, that maintains the same functions as one of SEQ ID NOs: 16-27 expression). In some embodiments, the vector is a pHR vector. In some embodiments, the vector is a lentiviral vector. The term \"lentivirus\" refers to a genus of the Retroviridae family. Lentiviruses are unique among the retroviruses in being able to infect non-dividing cells; they can deliver a significant amount of genetic information into the DNA of the host cell, so they are one of the most efficient methods of a gene delivery vector. HIV, SIV, and FIV are all examples of lentiviruses. The term \"lentiviral vector\" refers to a vector derived from at least a portion of a lentivirus genome, including especially a self-inactivating lentiviral vector Milone et al., Mol. Ther. 17(8): 1453-1464 (2009). Other examples of lentivirus vectors that may be used in the clinic, include but are not limited to, e.g., the LENTIVECTOR\u00ae gene delivery technology from Oxford BioMedica, the LENTIMAX vector system from Lentigen and the like. Nonclinical types of lentiviral vectors are also available and would be known to one skilled in the art. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the lentiviral vector comprises a central polypurine tract (cPPT; e.g., SEQ ID NO: 367). A central polypurine tract/central termination sequence creates a \"DNA flap\" that increases nuclear importation of the viral genome during target-cell infection. The cPPT/CTS element improves vector integration and transduction efficiency. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the lentiviral vector comprises a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE; e.g., SEQ ID NO: 368), which prevents poly(A) site read-through, promotes RNA processing and maturation, and increases nuclear export of RNA. In genomic transcripts, it enhances vector packaging and increases titer. In transduced target cells, the WPRE boosts transgene expression by facilitating mRNA transcript maturation. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the lentiviral vector comprises long terminal repeats (LTRs; e.g., SEQ ID NO: 369 and 370). LTRs are identical sequences of DNA that repeat hundreds or thousands of times found at either end of retrotransposons or proviral DNA formed by reverse transcription of retroviral RNA; they are used by viruses to insert their genetic material into the host genomes. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the lentiviral vector comprises Rev response elements (RRE; e.g., SEQ ID NO: 371), which is required for producing high titer vectors. Without limitations, the genes described herein can be included in one vector or separate vectors. For example, a polynucleotide encoding a synTF and a polynucleotide encoding a gene of interest can be included in the same vector. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a polynucleotide encoding a synTF and a polynucleotide encoding a gene of interest can be included in different vectors. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a single vector can comprise at least one polynucleotide encoding a synTF. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a single vector can comprise at least one polynucleotide encoding a gene of interest. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a single vector can comprise at least one polynucleotide encoding a synTF and at least one polynucleotide encoding a gene of interest. In one aspect, described herein are synTF lentiviral expression vectors (e.g., In embodiments, the synTF lentiviral expression vector comprises a polynucleotide encoding a synTF that is operably linked to a promoter (e.g., SFFV). In another aspect, described herein are lentiviral reporter vectors (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 52-60). In some embodiments, the lentiviral reporter vector comprises: (i) at least one (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, or more) DNA-binding motif (DBM) for the DBD of a synTF; (ii) a promoter sequence located 3 of the at least one DBM; and (iii) a detectable marker (i.e., a reporter; e.g., mCherry) that is operably linked to the promoter sequence. In some embodiments, the lentiviral reporter vector is an activation reporter (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 52-54) for a synTF comprising a transcriptional activation domain, such that when the inducible synTF is ON, the DBD of the synTF binds to the DBM of the reporter and, the transcriptional activation domain activates transcription of the detectable marker; when the DBD of the inducible synTF is OFF and not bound to the DBM of the reporter, the detectable marker is not produced as it is operably linked to only a core or minimal promoter (e.g., minCMV). In some embodiments, the lentiviral reporter vector is a repression reporter (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 55-60) for an inducible synTF comprising a transcriptional repressor domain, such that when the synTF is ON, the DBD of the synTF binds to the DBM of the reporter, and the transcriptional repressor domain represses transcription of the detectable marker; when the synTF is OFF, the DBD of the synTF is not bound to the DBM of the reporter, and the detectable marker is produced as it is operably linked to a full, constitutive promoter (e.g., full CMV or SFFV). In one aspect, described herein are gene of interest (GOI) lentiviral expression vectors (e.g., 61-64). In some embodiments, the GOI vector comprises a gene of interest that is operably linked to at least one (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, or more) DNA-binding motif (DBM) for the DBD of a synTF and a minimal promoter. In some embodiments, the GOI vector comprises a reporter vector as described herein, wherein the detectable marker is replaced with or fused to a gene of interest; as such the synTF can induce the expression of the gene of interest, or can repress the expression of a gene of interest, in the presence or absence of the regulator protein inducer.

In some embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by the gene of interest is a CD19 CAR (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 61, 373), e.g., linked to a detectable marker such as mCherry (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 372). In some embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by the gene of interest is IL2 (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 62, 374), which can be linked to a detectable marker, e.g., (huEGFRt), using a self-cleaving peptide. In some embodiments, the polypeptide encoded by the gene of interest is IL10 (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 63-64, 375). In one aspect described herein is a lentiviral vector that comprises both a synTF operably linked to a constitutive promoter and a gene of interest operably linked to at least one (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, or more) DNA-binding motif (DBM) for the DBD of a synTF and a minimal promoter (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 64). Accordingly, described herein is a nucleic acid construct comprising in the 5 to 3 direction: (a) a nucleic acid sequence encoding a gene of interest (GOI) in the inverse orientation; (b) a first promoter sequence in the inverse orientation and operatively linked to the nucleic acid encoding the GOI; (c) a nucleic acid sequence comprising at least one target DNA binding motif (DBM) comprising a target nucleic acid for binding of the at least one DBD of a synTF, wherein binding of the DBD of the synTF places the effector domain (ED) in the proximity of the promoter sequence operatively linked to the GOI; (d) a second promoter sequence; and (e) a nucleic acid sequence encoding the synthetic transcription factor (synTF), operatively linked to the second promoter sequence, wherein the encoded synTF comprises at least one DBD that binds to the at least DBM of the nucleic acid sequence of (c). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the promoter sequence operatively linked to the GOI is selected from any of: miniCMV promoter, miniTK promoter, minSV40 promoter, CMV53 promoter, pJB42CAT5 promoter, MLP promoter, and TATA promoter. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, wherein the promoter sequence operatively linked to the nucleic acid encoding the synTF is a pSFFV promoter, CMV pUb/UbC promoter, EF1a PGK/pGK promoter, CAG/CAGG promoter, SV40 promoter, and beta actin/ACTB promoter. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide encoding the synTF is operatively linked to an inducible promoter, which is active in the presence of the promoter activator or the absence of the promoter repressor, and inactive in the absence of the promoter inducer or the presence of the promoter repressor. Non-limiting examples of inducible promoters include: a doxycycline-inducible promoter, the lac promoter, the lacUV5 promoter, the tac promoter, the trc promoter, the T5 promoter, the T7 promoter, the T7-lac promoter, the araBAD promoter, the rha promoter, the tet promoter, an isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-dependent promoter, an AlcA promoter, a LexA promoter, a temperature inducible promoter (e.g., Hsp70 or Hsp90-derived promoters), or a light inducible promoter (e.g., pDawn/YFI/FixK2 promoter/CI/pR promoter system).

Non-limiting examples of selectable marker genes for use in bacteria include antibiotic resistance genes conferring resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and kanamycin. The tetracycline (tet) and ampicillin (amp) resistance marker genes can be obtained from any of a number of commercially available vectors including pBR322 (available from New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass., cat. no. 303-3s). The tet coding sequence is contained within nucleotides 86-476; the amp gene is contained within nucleotides 3295-4155. The nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin (kan) gene is available from vector pACYC 177, from New England BioLabs, Cat no. 401-L, GenBank accession No. X06402. In some embodiments, one or more of the recombinantly expressed genes can be integrated into the genome of the cell.

In one aspect described herein is a system for controlling gene expression, comprising: (a) at least one synthetic transcription factor (synTF) as described herein; and (b) at least one nucleic acid construct as described herein, e.g., a nucleic acid construct comprising: (i) at least one target DNA binding motif (DBM) comprising a target nucleic acid for binding of the at least one DBD of the synTF; (ii) a promoter sequence located 3 of the at least one DBM, and (iii) a gene of interest operatively linked to the promoter sequence. Exemplary systems are shown in Similarly, and by way of example only, in a synTF embodiment where the synTF is a cytosolic sequestering domain synTF, (i.e., where the cellular localization of the ED-DBD fusion protein is regulated by the at least one cytosolic sequestering regulator protein), in the presence of the RP inducer, the ED-DBD is not sequestered in the cytosol, enabling the DBD to bind to the DNA binding motif (DBM) and placing the transcriptional effector domain (ED) to be in proximity to the promoter sequence to control the expression of the gene of interest (\"ED-on\"). Accordingly, in the presence of the inducer, if the ED is a TA the ED-on configuration will enable gene expression to occur (referred to as \"TA-on\"), whereas if the ED is a TR, the ED-on configuration will result in repression of gene expression (e.g., referred to as \"TR-on\" and no gene expression). Alternatively, in the absence of the RP inducer, the ED coupled to the DBD of the synTF is sequestered in the cytosol, preventing the DBD of the synTF from binding to the DBM, and preventing the effector domain (ED) from being in proximity to the promoter sequence, preventing expression of the gene of interest (\"ED-off\"). Accordingly, in the absence of the inducer, in embodiments where the ED is a transcriptional activator (TA), it results in turning off the gene expression (\"TA-off\" (no expression)), whereas in embodiments where the ED is a transcriptional repressor protein (TR), it turns on gene expression (\"TR-off\", therefore repression is off, therefore enabling gene expression to occur). In some embodiments of any of the aspect described herein, the synTF is an induced degradation domain synTF or further comprises a N-terminal or C-terminal Small molecule-Assisted Shutoff (SMASh) domain. As described herein, the SMASh domain comprises a self-cleaving SMASh protease, a partial protease helical domain and a cofactor domain. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, in the presence of an inhibitor to the SMASh protease (referred to as a \"SMASh inhibitor\"), the SMASh protease activity is inhibited resulting in the synTF being degraded, which prevents the DBD binding to the DBM and controlling the expression or repression of the gene of interest (\"synTF-degradation\"; ED-off). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, in the absence of an inhibitor to the SMASh protease, the SMASh protease is active and self cleaves/uncouples from the synTF, resulting the SMASh domain being targeted for degradation and allowing the DBD of the synTF to bind to the DBM and the ED of synTF to control the expression of the gene of interest (\"SMASh-degradation, TA-on (yes-expression), TR-on (no-expression)). Accordingly, the expression of the GOI is dependent on 3 levels of control, including but not limited to; (i) the type of regulator protein in the synTF, (ii) the presence or absence of a regulator protein inducer (RP inducer), and (iii) the type of effector domain. In some embodiments, if the synTF comprises an induced degradation domain or SMASh domain, it can also provide an additional level of control on the expression of the GOI. The ultimate expression of the GOI of synTF comprising a SMASh domain are shown in Table 20B. As indicated in Table 20B, if the SMASh inhibitor is present, then even in the absence or presence of the regulator protein inducer (e.g., protease is degraded and the expression of the GOI depends on whether the ED is a TA or TR. However, in the absence of the SMASh inhibitor, the expression of the GOI is dependent on the presence or absence of the regulator protein inducer, as shown in Table 20B. Accordingly, in one aspect, described herein is a system for controlling gene expression, comprising: (a) at least one synthetic transcription factor (synTF) comprising at least one DNA binding domain (DBD), a transcriptional effector domain (ED), and at least one regulator protein (RP), wherein the ED is directly or indirectly coupled or linked to the DBD, and wherein the coupling is regulated by the at least one RP, or wherein the cellular localization of the ED linked to the DBD is regulated by the at least one RP, wherein the at least one RP is regulated by an RP inducer, wherein the DBD can bind to a target DNA binding motif (DBM) located upstream of a promoter operatively linked to a gene; (b) a nucleic acid construct comprising: (i) at least one target DNA binding motif (DBM) comprising a target nucleic acid for binding of the at least one DBD of the synTF, and (ii) a promoter sequence located 3 of the at least one DBM, and (iii) a gene of interest operatively linked to the promoter sequence; wherein for synTFs where the coupling of the ED to the DBD is regulated by the at least one RP; in the presence of the RP inducer, the coupling of the ED to the DBD of the synTF is maintained, enabling the ED to be in proximity to the promoter sequence when the DBD binds to the DNA binding motif (DBM), where the ED controls the expression of the gene of interest (\"ED-on\"), or in the absence of the RP inducer, the coupling of the ED to the DBD of the synTF is severed, preventing the ED from being in proximity to the promoter sequence when the DBD binds to the DNA binding motif (DBM), preventing gene expression of the gene of interest (\"ED-off\"); and wherein for synTFs where the cellular localization of the ED linked to the DBD is regulated by the at least one regulator protein; in the presence of the RP inducer, the ED coupled to the DBD of the synTF is not sequestered in the cytosol, enabling the DBD to bind to the DNA binding motif (DBM) and enabling the transcriptional effector domain (ED) to be in proximity to the promoter sequence to control the expression of the gene of interest (\"ED-on\"), or in the absence of the RP inducer, the ED coupled to the DBD of the synTF is sequestered in the cytosol, preventing the DBD of the synTF from binding to the DBM, and preventing the effector domain (ED) from being in proximity to the promoter sequence, preventing expression of the gene of interest (\"ED-off\"). Nucleic Acid Constructs Encoding the GOI for Regulation by the synTF As described herein, in some aspects, the system comprises a synTF as described herein and a nucleic acid construct comprising the GOI. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid construct comprises in the 5 to 3 direction, (i) a DBA binding motif (DBM) that enables binding of the DBD of the synTF, (ii) a promoter sequence, and (iii) a nucleic acid encoding the GOI, where the nucleic acid encoding the GOI is operatively linked to the promoter sequence. An exemplary system is shown in In some embodiments, the system further comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding the synTF, operatively linked to a promoter, for example, where the promoter is a constitutive promoter, see, e.g. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid construct comprises (i) a first nucleic acid encoding the synTF under a promoter and (ii) a second nucleic acid construct comprising (i) a DBA binding motif (DBM) that enables binding of the DBD of the expressed synTF, (ii) a promoter sequence, and (iii) a nucleic acid encoding the GOI, where the nucleic acid encoding the GOI is operatively linked to the promoter sequence. Accordingly, the nucleic acid encoding the inducible synTF and the GOI are present on the same nucleic acid construct, see, for example, In some embodiments, the nucleic acid construct comprises (i) a first promoter operatively linked to a nucleic acid encoding the synTF, and (ii) a nucleic acid encoding a GOI, operatively linked to a second promoter, where 5 to the second promoter is the DBM for the synTF protein which is expressed under control of the first promoter.

In other embodiments, the cell comprises a B cell. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the cells are isolated from a subject. The term \"isolated\" as used herein signifies that the cells are placed into conditions other than their natural environment. The term \"isolated\" does not preclude the later use of these cells thereafter in combinations or mixtures with other cells. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, an immune cell (e.g., T cell) is: (a) isolated from the subject; (b) genetically modified to express a synTF system as described herein; and (c) administered to the subject. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the cells are isolated from a first subject and administered to a second subject.

Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration In some embodiments, the methods described herein relate to treating a subject having or diagnosed as having a disease or disorder (e.g., cancer or autoimmunity) with a synTF system as described herein. Subjects having such a disease or disorder can be identified by a physician using current methods of diagnosis for cancer or autoimmunity. Symptoms and/or complications which characterize these conditions and aid in diagnosis are known in the art. A family history of cancer or autoimmunity, or exposure to risk factors for cancer or autoimmunity can also aid in determining if a subject is likely to have such a disease or disorder, or in making a diagnosis of cancer or autoimmunity. The compositions described herein can be administered to a subject having or diagnosed as having cancer or autoimmunity. In some embodiments, the methods described herein comprise administering an effective amount of compositions described herein, e.g. a synTF system as described herein to a subject in order to alleviate a symptom of cancer or autoimmunity. As used herein, \"alleviating a symptom\" is ameliorating any condition or symptom associated with the cancer or autoimmunity. As compared with an equivalent untreated control, such reduction is by at least more as measured by any standard technique. A variety of means for administering the compositions described herein to subjects are known to those of skill in the art. An agent can be administered intravenously by injection or by gradual infusion over time. Given an appropriate formulation for a given route, for example, agents useful in the methods and compositions described herein can be be delivered by peristaltic means, if desired, or by other means known by those skilled in the art. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the compounds used herein are administered orally, intravenously or intramuscularly. Administration can be local or systemic. Local administration, e.g., directly to the site of an organ or tissue transplant is specifically contemplated. Therapeutic compositions containing at least one agent can be conventionally administered in a unit dose, for example. The term \"unit dose\" when used in reference to a therapeutic composition refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosage for the subject, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required physiologically acceptable diluent, i.e., carrier, or vehicle. The compositions are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in a therapeutically effective amount. The quantity to be administered and timing depends on the subject to be treated, capacity of the subject's system to utilize the active ingredient, and degree of therapeutic effect desired. In embodiments where the subject is administered a synTF cell and a regulator protein inducer to modulate the activity of the synTF polypeptide(s) (e.g., grazoprevir, ABA, 4OHT), the cells and drug(s) can be administered together or separately. In embodiments where the subject is separately administered a synTF cell and a drug to modulate the activity of the synTF polypeptide(s), each of the compositions can be administered, separately, according to any of the dosages and administration routes/routines described herein. The term \"effective amount\" as used herein refers to the amount of a synTF system as described herein and/or a regulator protein inducer (e.g., grazoprevir, ABA, 4OHT) needed to alleviate at least one or more symptom of the disease or disorder, and relates to a sufficient amount of pharmacological composition to provide the desired effect. The term \"therapeutically effective amount\" therefore refers to an amount of a synTF system as described herein and/or a regulator protein inducer (e.g., grazoprevir, ABA, 4OHT) that is sufficient to provide a particular anti-tumor or anti-autoimmune effect when administered to a typical subject. An effective amount as used herein, in various contexts, would also include an amount sufficient to delay the development of a symptom of the disease, alter the course of a symptom disease (for example but not limited to, slowing the progression of a symptom of the disease), or reverse a symptom of the disease. Thus, it is not generally practicable to specify an exact \"effective amount\". However, for any given case, an appropriate \"effective amount\" can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation. Effective amounts, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dosage can vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compositions and methods that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. A therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. Also, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of a synTF system as described herein and/or a regulator protein inducer (e.g., grazoprevir, ABA, 4OHT)), which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture, or in an appropriate animal model. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography for the regulator protein inducer or flow cytometry for synTF cells. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay. The dosage can be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment. Effective amounts, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the minimal effective dose and/or maximal tolerated dose. The dosage can vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. A therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. Also, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a dosage range between the minimal effective dose and the maximal tolerated dose. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay, e.g., assay for tumor growth and/or size among others. The dosage can be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment. It can generally be stated that a pharmaceutical composition comprising the synTF-system-expressing cells described herein may be administered at a dosage of 102 to 1010 cells/kg body weight, preferably 105 to 106 cells/kg body weight, including all integer values within those ranges. The number of cells will depend upon the ultimate use for which the composition is intended as will the type of cells included therein. For uses provided herein, the cells are generally in a volume of a liter or less, can be 500 mLs or less, even 250 mLs or 100 mLs or less. Hence the density of the desired cells is typically greater than 106 cells/ml and generally is greater than 107 cells/ml, generally 108 cells/ml or greater. The clinically relevant number of immune cells can be apportioned into multiple infusions that cumulatively equal or exceed 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 1010, 1011, or 1012 cells. SynTF-system-expressing cell compositions may be administered multiple times at dosages within these ranges. The cells may be allogeneic, syngeneic, xenogeneic, or autologous to the patient undergoing therapy. If desired, the treatment may also include administration of mitogens (e.g., PHA) or described herein to enhance induction of the immune response. In some embodiments, the dosage can be from about 1\u00d7105 cells to about 1\u00d7108 cells per kg of body weight. In some embodiments, the dosage can be from about 1\u00d7106 cells to about 1\u00d7107 cells per kg of body weight. In some embodiments, the dosage can be about 1\u00d7106 cells per kg of body weight. In some embodiments, one dose of cells can be administered. In some embodiments, the dose of cells can be repeated, e.g., once, twice, or more. In some embodiments, the dose of cells can be administered on, e.g., a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. In certain embodiments, an effective dose of a regulatory protein inducer (e.g., grazoprevir, ABA, 4OHT; also referred to herein as an inducer agent) that regulates the activity of a synTF as described herein can be administered to a patient once. In certain embodiments, an effective dose of a regulatory protein inducer can be administered to a patient repeatedly.

In some embodiments, a total of 6 doses are administered. In some embodiments, a total of 7 doses are administered. In some embodiments, a total of 8 doses are administered. In some embodiments, the administration occurs for a total of from about 4 weeks to about 12 weeks. In some embodiments, the administration occurs for a total of about 6 weeks. In some embodiments, the administration occurs for a total of about 8 weeks. In some embodiments, the administration occurs for a total of about 12 weeks. In some embodiments, the initial dose can be from about 1.5 to about 2.5 fold greater than subsequent doses. In some embodiments, the dose can be from about 1 mg to about 2000 mg. In some embodiments, the dose can be about 3 mg. In some embodiments, the dose can be about 10 mg. In some embodiments, the dose can be about 30 mg. In some embodiments, the dose can be about 1000 mg. In some embodiments, the dose can be about 2000 mg. In some embodiments, the dose can be about 3 mg given by intravenous infusion daily. In some embodiments, the dose can be about 10 mg given by intravenous infusion daily. In some embodiments, the dose can be about 30 mg given by intravenous infusion three times per week. In some embodiments, after an initial treatment regimen, the treatments can be administered on a less frequent basis. For example, after treatment biweekly for three months, treatment can be repeated once per month, for six months or a year or longer. Treatment according to the methods described herein can reduce levels of a marker or symptom of a condition, e.g. by at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or at least 90% or more. The dosage of a synTF cell and/or regulatory protein inducer as described herein can be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment. With respect to duration and frequency of treatment, it is typical for skilled clinicians to monitor subjects in order to determine when the treatment is providing therapeutic benefit, and to determine whether to increase or decrease dosage, increase or decrease administration frequency, discontinue treatment, resume treatment, or make other alterations to the treatment regimen. The dosing schedule can vary from once a week to daily depending on a number of clinical factors, such as the subject's sensitivity to the synTF system and/or the regulatory protein inducer. The desired dose or amount can be administered at one time or divided into subdoses, e.g., 2-4 subdoses and administered over a period of time, e.g., at appropriate intervals through the day or other appropriate schedule. In some embodiments, administration can be chronic, e.g., one or more doses and/or treatments daily over a period of weeks or months. Examples of dosing and/or treatment schedules are administration daily, twice daily, three times daily or four or more times daily over a period of 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, or 6 months, or more. A composition comprising a synTF system as described herein can be administered over a period of time, such as over a 5 minute, 10 minute, 15 minute, 20 minute, or 25 minute period. The dosage ranges for the administration of a synTF system, according to the methods described herein depend upon, for example, the form of the synTF system, its potency, and the extent to which symptoms, markers, or indicators of a condition described herein are desired to be reduced, for example the percentage reduction desired for the disease or disorder (e.g., cancer or autoimmunity). The dosage should not be so large as to cause adverse side effects. Generally, the dosage will vary with the age, condition, and sex of the patient and can be determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication. The efficacy of a synTF system in, e.g. the treatment of a condition described herein can be determined by the skilled clinician. However, a treatment is considered \"effective treatment,\" as the term is used herein, if one or more of the signs or symptoms of a condition described herein are altered in a beneficial manner, other clinically accepted symptoms are improved, or even ameliorated, or a desired response is induced e.g., by at least 10% following treatment according to the methods described herein. Efficacy can be assessed, for example, by measuring a marker, indicator, symptom, and/or the incidence of a condition treated according to the methods described herein or any other measurable parameter appropriate, e.g. tumor size. Efficacy can also be measured by a failure of an individual to worsen as assessed by hospitalization, or need for medical interventions (i.e., progression of the disease is halted). Methods of measuring these indicators are known to those of skill in the art and/or are described herein. Treatment includes any treatment of a disease in an individual or an animal (some non-limiting examples include a human or an animal) and includes: (1) inhibiting the disease, e.g., preventing a worsening of symptoms (e.g. pain or inflammation); or (2) relieving the severity of the disease, e.g., causing regression of symptoms. An effective amount for the treatment of a disease means that amount which, when administered to a subject in need thereof, is sufficient to result in effective treatment as that term is defined herein, for that disease. Efficacy of an agent can be determined by assessing physical indicators of a condition or desired response, (e.g. tumor size). It is well within the ability of one skilled in the art to monitor efficacy of administration and/or treatment by measuring any one of such parameters, or any combination of parameters. Efficacy can be assessed in animal models of a condition described herein, for example treatment of cancer. When using an experimental animal model, efficacy of treatment is evidenced when a statistically significant change in a marker is observed, e.g. tumor size. In vitro and animal model assays are provided herein which allow the assessment of a given dose of a synTF system. The efficacy of a given dosage combination can also be assessed in an animal model, e.g. a specific cancer animal model. In one aspect, described herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising the at least one synTF polypeptide, synTF system, synTF polynucleotide, synTF vector, or synTF-comprising cell as described herein, which are collectively referred to as a \"synTF composition\" (see e.g., Tables 1-2). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the pharmaceutical composition can comprise any combination of synTF polypeptides or systems (see e.g., Table 9). In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the pharmaceutical composition can further comprise a regulator protein inducer (e.g., grazoprevir, ABA, 4OHT). In some embodiments, the technology described herein relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a synTF composition and/or regulator protein inducer as described herein, and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the active ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition comprise the synTF system and/or the regulator protein inducer as described herein. In some embodiments, the active ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition consist essentially of the synTF system and/or the regulator protein inducer as described herein. In some embodiments, the active ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition consist of the synTF system and/or the regulator protein inducer as described herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and diluents include saline, aqueous buffer solutions, solvents and/or dispersion media. The use of such carriers and diluents is well known in the art. Some non-limiting examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) as polypeptides amino acids; (23) serum component, such as serum HDL and LDL; (24) C2-C12 alcohols, such as ethanol; and (25) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations. Wetting agents, coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, preservative and antioxidants can also be present in the formulation. The terms such as \"excipient\", \"carrier\", \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" or the like are used interchangeably herein. In some embodiments, the carrier inhibits the degradation of the active agent, e.g. the synTF polypeptide, the synTF system, and/or the regulator protein inducer as described herein. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprising a synTF composition and/or a regulator protein inducer as described herein can be a parenteral dose form. Since administration of parenteral dosage forms typically bypasses the patient's natural defenses against contaminants, parenteral dosage forms are preferably sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, solutions ready for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions. In addition, controlled-release parenteral dosage forms can be prepared for administration of a patient, including, but not limited to, DUROS\u00ae-type dosage forms and dose-dumping. Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms of synTF compositions and/or a regulator protein inducer as disclosed within are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, without limitation: sterile water; water for injection USP; saline solution; glucose solution; aqueous vehicles such as but not limited to, sodium chloride injection, Ringer's injection, dextrose Injection, and lactated Ringer's injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and propylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising synTF compositions and/or a regulator protein inducer can also be formulated to be suitable for oral administration, for example as discrete dosage forms, such as, but not limited to, tablets (including without limitation scored or coated tablets), pills, caplets, capsules, chewable tablets, powder packets, cachets, troches, wafers, aerosol sprays, or liquids, such as but not limited to, syrups, elixirs, solutions or suspensions in an aqueous liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil emulsion. Such compositions contain a predetermined amount of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the disclosed compounds, and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See generally, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, Philadelphia Pa. (2005). Conventional dosage forms generally provide rapid or immediate drug release from the formulation. Depending on the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the drug, use of conventional dosage forms can lead to wide fluctuations in the concentrations of the drug in a patient's blood and other tissues. These fluctuations can impact a number of parameters, such as dose frequency, onset of action, duration of efficacy, maintenance of therapeutic blood levels, toxicity, side effects, and the like. Advantageously, controlled-release formulations can be used to control a drug's onset of action, duration of action, plasma levels within the therapeutic window, and peak blood levels. In particular, controlled- or extended-release dosage forms or formulations can be used to ensure that the maximum effectiveness of a drug is achieved while minimizing potential adverse effects and safety concerns, which can occur both from under-dosing a drug (i.e., going below the minimum therapeutic levels) as well as exceeding the toxicity level for the drug. In some embodiments, the composition can be administered in a sustained release formulation. Controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled release counterparts. Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release formulations include: 1) extended activity of the drug; 2) reduced dosage frequency; 3) increased patient compliance; 4) usage of less total drug; 5) reduction in local or systemic side effects; 6) minimization of drug accumulation; 7) reduction in blood level fluctuations; 8) improvement in efficacy of treatment; 9) reduction of potentiation or loss of drug activity; and 10) improvement in speed of control of diseases or conditions. Kim, Cherng-ju, Controlled Release Dosage Form Design, 2 (Technomic Publishing, Lancaster, Pa.: 2000). Most controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug (active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH, ionic strength, osmotic pressure, temperature, enzymes, water, and other physiological conditions or compounds. A variety of known controlled- or extended-release dosage forms, formulations, and devices can be adapted for use with the salts and compositions of the disclosure. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. which is incorporated herein by reference. These dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems (such as OROS\u00ae (Alza Corporation, Mountain View, Calif. USA)), or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF composition and/or regulator protein inducer described herein is administered as a monotherapy, e.g., another treatment for the disease or disorder (e.g., cancer) is not administered to the subject. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the methods described herein can further comprise administering a second agent and/or treatment to the subject, e.g. as part of a combinatorial therapy. Non-limiting examples of a second agent and/or treatment can include calicheamicin, especially calicheamicin gamma1I and VEGF-A that reduce cell proliferation and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, acids or derivatives of any of the above. In addition, the methods of treatment can further include the use of radiation or radiation therapy. Further, the methods of treatment can further include the use of surgical treatments.VII. Treatment Methods The synTF compositions described herein can be administered to a subject in need thereof, in particular the treatment of cancer or autoimmunity. Autoimmunity is the system of immune responses of an organism against its own healthy cells and tissues. Any disease that results from such an aberrant immune response is termed an \"autoimmune disease\". In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the subject has a genetic disorder in need of regenerative medicine and/or immunotherapy. In some embodiments, the synTF system expresses a gene of interest (e.g., a therapeutic protein, analyte), which is controlled by at least one inducible synTF, that is itself regulated by at least one regulator protein and its corresponding regulator protein inducer. As such, the expression of the gene of interest can be specifically regulated by the presence, absence, or increased or decreased level of the regulator protein inducer (e.g., an FDA-approved small molecule such as grazoprevir, ABA, or 4OHT) for the treatment of a disease such as cancer, autoimmunity, or a genetic disorder. By way of example only, In some embodiments, the method of treatment can comprise first diagnosing a subject or patient who can benefit from treatment by a composition described herein. In some embodiments, such diagnosis comprises detecting or measuring an abnormal level of a marker (e.g., the tumor antigens as described herein) in a sample from the subject or patient. In some embodiments, the method further comprises administering to the patient a synTF composition as described herein. In some embodiments, the subject has previously been determined to have an abnormal level of an analyte described herein relative to a reference. In some embodiments, the reference level can be the level in a sample of similar cell type, sample type, sample processing, and/or obtained from a subject of similar age, sex and other demographic parameters as the sample/subject. In some embodiments, the test sample and control reference sample are of the same type, that is, obtained from the same biological source, and comprising the same composition, e.g. the same number and type of cells. The term \"sample\" or \"test sample\" as used herein denotes a sample taken or isolated from a biological organism, e.g., a blood or plasma sample from a subject. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the technology described herein encompasses several examples of a biological sample. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the biological sample is cells, or tissue, or peripheral blood, or bodily fluid. Exemplary biological samples include, but are not limited to, a biopsy, a sample etc. The term also includes a mixture of the above-mentioned samples. The term \"test sample\" also includes untreated or pretreated (or pre-processed) biological samples. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a test sample can comprise cells from a subject. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the step of determining if the subject has an abnormal level of an analyte described herein can comprise i) obtaining or having obtained a sample from the subject and ii) performing or having performed an assay on the sample obtained from the subject to determine/measure the level of the analyte in the subject.

In one aspect of any of the embodiments, described herein is a method of treating cancer (or another disease or disorder as described herein) in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising: a) determining if the subject has an abnormal level of an analyte described herein; and b) instructing or directing that the subject be administered a synTF composition as described herein if the level of the analyte is increased or otherwise abnormal relative to a reference. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the step of instructing or directing that the subject be administered a particular treatment can comprise providing a report of the assay results. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the step of instructing or directing that the subject be administered a particular treatment can comprise providing a report of the assay results and/or treatment recommendations in view of the assay results. In one aspect, described herein is a method of regulating the activity of a synTF, comprising the steps of: (a) providing a population of cells comprising a synTF as described herein; and (b) contacting the population of cells with an effective amount of a regulator protein inducer. In one aspect, described herein is a method of regulating the expression of a gene of interest, comprising the steps of: (a) providing a population of cells comprising a synTF system as described herein; and (b) contacting the population of cells with an effective amount of a regulator protein inducer. In one aspect, described herein is a method of treating a subject in need of a cell-based therapy. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a subject in need of a cell-based therapy comprises any subject that would benefit from regulated expression of a gene of interest. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a subject in need of a cell-based therapy comprises a subject with cancer, autoimmunity, or another disease or disorder as described herein. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the subject has a genetic disorder in need of regenerative medicine and/or immunotherapy. Accordingly, the method comprises the steps of: (a) administering to the subject a population of cells comprising a synTF system as described herein; and (b) administering to the subject an effective amount of a regulator protein inducer. In embodiments wherein the synTF comprises a transcriptional activator and a repressible protease, induced proximity domain, and/or cytosolic sequestering domain, in the presence of the regulator protein inducer, the synTF is ON and the transcription of the gene of interest is ON; and in the absence of the regulator protein inducer, the synTF is OFF and the transcription of the gene of interest is OFF.

In some embodiments, an immune cell (e.g., T cell) comprising a synTF system expressing an anti-cancer gene of interest to treat a cancer. As used herein, the term \"cancer\" relates generally to a class of diseases or conditions in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues. Cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems. There are several main types of cancer. Carcinoma is a cancer that begins in the skin or in tissues that line or cover internal organs. Sarcoma is a cancer that begins in bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other connective or supportive tissue. Leukemia is a cancer that starts in blood-forming tissue such as the bone marrow, and causes large numbers of abnormal blood cells to be produced and enter the blood. Lymphoma and multiple myeloma are cancers that begin in the cells of the immune system. Central nervous system cancers are cancers that begin in the tissues of the brain and spinal cord. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the cancer is a primary cancer. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the cancer is a malignant cancer. As used herein, the term \"malignant\" refers to a cancer in which a group of tumor cells display one or more of uncontrolled growth (i.e., division beyond normal limits), invasion (i.e., intrusion on and destruction of adjacent tissues), and metastasis (i.e., spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood). As used herein, the term \"metastasize\" refers to the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another. A tumor formed by cells that have spread is called a \"metastatic tumor\" or a \"metastasis.\" The metastatic tumor contains cells that are like those in the original (primary) tumor. As used herein, the term \"benign\" or \"non-malignant\" refers to tumors that may grow larger but do not spread to other parts of the body. Benign tumors are self-limited and typically do not invade or metastasize. A \"cancer cell\" or \"tumor cell\" refers to an individual cell of a cancerous growth or tissue. A tumor refers generally to a swelling or lesion formed by an abnormal growth of cells, which may be benign, pre-malignant, or malignant. Most cancer cells form tumors, but some, e.g., leukemia, do not necessarily form tumors. For those cancer cells that form tumors, the terms cancer (cell) and tumor (cell) are used interchangeably. As used herein the term \"neoplasm\" refers to any new and abnormal growth of tissue, e.g., an abnormal mass of tissue, the growth of which exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of the normal tissues. Thus, a neoplasm can be a benign neoplasm, premalignant neoplasm, or a malignant neoplasm. A subject that has a cancer or a tumor is a subject having objectively measurable cancer cells present in the subject's body. Included in this definition are malignant, actively proliferative cancers, as well as potentially dormant tumors or micrometastases. Cancers which migrate from their original location and seed other vital organs can eventually lead to the death of the subject through the functional deterioration of the affected organs. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, leukemia, basal cell carcinoma, cancer; and cancer; eye cancer; cancer lung cancer (e.g., small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, and squamous carcinoma of melanoma; myeloma; cancer; pancreatic cancer; prostate cancer; as other carcinomas grade NHL; grade lymphoblastic NHL; high grade small lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), as abnormal vascular proliferation associated with phakomatoses, edema (such as that associated with brain tumors), and Meigs' syndrome. A \"cancer cell\" is a cancerous, pre-cancerous, or transformed cell, either in vivo, ex vivo, or in tissue culture, that has spontaneous or induced phenotypic changes that do not necessarily involve the uptake of new genetic material. Although transformation can arise from infection with a transforming virus and incorporation of new genomic nucleic acid, or uptake of exogenous nucleic acid, it can also arise spontaneously or following exposure to a carcinogen, thereby mutating an endogenous gene. Transformation/cancer is associated with, e.g., morphological changes, immortalization of cells, aberrant growth control, foci formation, anchorage independence, malignancy, loss of contact inhibition and density limitation of growth, growth factor or serum independence, tumor specific markers, invasiveness or metastasis, and tumor growth in suitable animal hosts such as nude mice.Autoimmune Diseases In various embodiments, an cell comprising a synTF system can be used to treat an autoimmune disease. In some embodiments, an immune cell (e.g., T cell) comprising a synTF system expressing a gene of interest directed against an autoimmune disease-specific antigen can be used to treat an autoimmune disease. \"Autoimmune disease\" refers to a class of diseases in which a subject's own antibodies react with host tissue or in which immune effector T cells are autoreactive to endogenous self-peptides and cause destruction of tissue. Thus an immune response is mounted against a subject's own antigens, referred to as self-antigens. A \"self-antigen\" as used herein refers to an antigen of a normal host tissue. Normal host tissue does not include neoplastic cells. Autoantigens, as used herein, are endogenous proteins or fragments thereof that elicit this pathogenic immune response. Autoantigen can be any substance or a portion thereof normally found within a mammal that, in an autoimmune disease, becomes the primary (or a primary) target of attack by the immune system. The term also includes antigenic substances that induce conditions having the characteristics of an autoimmune disease when administered to mammals. Additionally, the term includes peptic subclasses consisting essentially of of autoantigens. Immunodominant epitopes or regions in induced autoimmune conditions are fragments of an autoantigen that can be used instead of the entire autoantigen to induce the disease. In humans afflicted with an autoimmune disease, immunodominant epitopes or regions are fragments of antigens specific to the tissue or organ under autoimmune attack and recognized by a substantial percentage (e.g. a majority though not necessarily an absolute majority) of autoimmune attack T-cells. Autoantigens that are known to be associated with autoimmune disease include myelin proteins with demyelinating diseases, e.g. multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune myelitis; collagens antigen (ICA512; ICA12) with insulin dependent diabetes. A common feature in a number of autoimmune related diseases and inflammatory conditions is the involvement of pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells. These T cells are responsible for the release of inflammatory, Th1 type cytokines. Cytokines characterized as Th1 type TNF and IL-12. Such pro-inflammatory cytokines act to stimulate the immune response, in many cases resulting in the destruction of autologous tissue. Cytokines associated with suppression of T cell response are the Th2 type, and include IL-10, IL-4 and TGF-.

In some embodiments, a cell comprising a synTF system expressing a gene of interest that replaces a defective gene can be used to treat a genetic disorder. In some embodiments, the cell is a stem cell. Non-limiting examples of genetic disorders that can be treated using a synTF system or cell as described For convenience, the meaning of some terms and phrases used in the specification, examples, and appended claims, are provided below. Unless stated otherwise, or implicit from context, the following terms and phrases include the meanings provided below. The definitions are provided to aid in describing particular embodiments, and are not intended to limit the claimed invention, because the scope of the invention is limited only by the claims. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. If there is an apparent discrepancy between the usage of a term in the art and its definition provided herein, the definition provided within the specification shall prevail. For convenience, certain terms employed herein, in the specification, examples and appended claims are collected here. As used herein, the term \"engineered responsive reporter\" or \"engineered transcription unit\" is a nucleic acid construct containing an engineered promoter that is operably linked to a reporter gene, and the expression of the reporter gene is controlled by upstream regulatory elements such orthogonal DNA target sequence(s) in the engineered promoter. A reporter gene is typically one where the gene product, the transcribed protein, is easily detected and monitored, e.g., the green fluorescent protein. As used herein, the term \"promoter\" as used in the art, is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene and is at which RNA polymerase binds and initiates transcription. Promoters are located near the transcription start sites of genes, on the same strand and upstream on the DNA As used herein, the term \"orthogonal\" when used in DNA sequences and genome biology \"orthogonal\" means DNA sequences that are so dissimilar from that which is naturally occurring in nature in the eukaryotic system. As used herein, the term \"responsive\" in the context of an engineered promoter or engineered transcription unit or engineered responsive reporter, the term refers to whether gene transcription initiation from the promoter is enhanced or repressed when upstream nearby orthogonal DNA target sequences are bound by their respective ZF-containing synthetic transcription factors. As used herein, the term \"operably linked\" when used in context of the orthogonal DNA target sequences described herein or the promoter sequence (RNA polymerase binding site) in a nucleic acid construct, an engineered responsive reporter, and in an engineered transcription unit means that the orthogonal DNA target sequences and the promoters are in-frame and in proper spatial and distance away from a nucleic acid coding for a protein or peptide or an RNA to permit the effects of the respective binding by transcription factors or RNA polymerase on transcription. The terms \"nucleic acid\", \"polynucleotide\", and \"oligonucleotide\" are used interchangeably and refer to a deoxyribonucleotide (DNA) or ribonucleotide (RNA) polymer, in linear or circular conformation, and in either single- or double-stranded form. For the purposes of the present disclosure such DNA or RNA polymers may include natural nucleotides, non-natural or synthetic nucleotides, and mixtures thereof. Non-natural nucleotides may include analogues of natural nucleotides, as well as nucleotides that are modified in the base, sugar and/or phosphate moieties (e.g. phosphorothioate backbones). Non-limiting examples of modified nucleic acids are PNAs and morpholino nucleic acids. Generally an analogue of a particular nucleotide has the same base-pairing specificity, i.e. an analogue of G will base-pair with C. For the purposes of the disclosure, these terms are not to be considered limiting with respect to the length of a polymer. A \"gene\", as used herein, is the segment of nucleic acid (typically DNA) that is involved in producing a polypeptide or ribonucleic acid gene product. It includes regions preceding and following the coding region (leader and trailer) as well as intervening sequences (introns) between individual coding segments (exons). Conveniently, this term also includes the necessary control sequences for gene expression (e g enhancers, silencers, promoters, terminators etc.), which may be adjacent to or distant to the relevant coding sequence, as well as the coding and/or transcribed regions encoding the gene product. As used herein the term \"modulation\", in relation to the expression of a gene refers to a change in the gene's activity. Modulation includes both activation (i.e. increase in activity or expression level) and repression or inhibition of gene activity. In preferred embodiments of the disclosure, the therapeutic molecules (e.g. peptides) of the disclosure are repressors of gene expression or activity. A nucleic acid site\" used herein, is a nucleic acid sequence to which a ZFA in a synTF of the disclosure will bind, provided that conditions of the binding reaction are not prohibitive. A target site may be a nucleic acid molecule or a portion of a larger polynucleotide. In accordance with the disclosure, a target sequence for a ZFA in a synTF of the disclosure may comprise a single contiguous nucleic acid sequence. These terms may also be substituted or supplemented with the terms \"binding site\", \"binding As used herein, \"binding\" refers to a non-covalent interaction between macromolecules (e.g. between a ZF-array containing protein and a nucleic acid target site). In some cases binding will be sequence-specific, such as between one or more specific nucleotides (or base pairs) and one or more specific amino acids. It will be appreciated, however, that not all components of a binding interaction need be sequence-specific (e.g. non-covalent interactions with phosphate residues in a DNA backbone). Binding interactions between a nucleic acid sequence and a ZF peptide of the disclosure may be characterized by binding affinity and/or dissociation constant (Kd). A suitable dissociation constant for a ZF peptide of the disclosure binding to its target site may be in the order of 1 M or lower, 1 nM or lower, or 1 pM or lower. \"Affinity\" refers to the strength of binding, such that increased binding affinity correlates with a lower Kd value. ZF synTF of the disclosure may have DNA-binding activity, RNA-binding activity, and/or even protein-binding activity. In some embodiments, the ZF synTF of the disclosure are designed or selected to have sequence specific dsDNA-binding activity. For example, the target site for a particular ZF array or protein is a sequence to which the ZF concerned is capable of nucleotide-specific binding. It will be appreciated, however, that depending on the amino acid sequence of a ZF array or protein it may bind to or recognize more than one target sequence, although typically one sequence will be bound in preference to any other recognized sequences, depending on the relative specificity of the individual non-covalent interactions. Generally, specific binding is preferably achieved with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1 nM or lower, 100 pM or lower; or 10 pM or lower. In some embodiments, a ZF synTF of the disclosure binds to a specific target sequence with a dissociation constant of 1 nM or lower, or 1 pM or lower, or 0.1 pM or lower, or even 10 fM or lower. By \"non-target\" it is meant that the nucleic acid sequence concerned is not appreciably bound by the relevant ZF peptide. In some embodiments it may be considered that, where a ZF peptide described herein has a known sequence-specific target sequence, all other nucleic acid sequences may be considered to be non-target. From a practical perspective it can be convenient to define an interaction between a non-target sequence and a particular ZF peptide as being sub-physiological (i.e. not capable of creating a physiological response under physiological target sequence/ZF peptide concentrations). For example, if any binding can be measured between the ZF peptide and the non-target sequence, the dissociation constant (Kd) is typically weaker than 1 M, such as 10 M or weaker, 100 M or weaker, or at least 1 mM. As used herein, the term \"interaction\" when used in the context of a receptor and its ligand refers to the binding between the receptor and its ligand as a result of the non-covalent bonds between the ligand-binding site (or fragment) of the receptor and the receptor-binding site (or fragment) of the ligand. In the context of two entities, e.g., molecules or proteins, having some binding affinity for each other, the term \"interaction\" refers to the binding of the two entities as a result of the non-covalent bonds between the two entities. A term \"interaction\", \"complexing\" and \"bonding\" are used interchangeably when used in the context of a receptor and its ligand and in the context of two binding entities. The terms \"decrease\", \"reduced\", \"reduction\", or \"inhibit\" are all used herein to mean a decrease by a statistically significant amount. In some embodiments, \"reduce,\" \"reduction\" or \"decrease\" or \"inhibit\" typically means a decrease by at least 10% as compared to a reference level (e.g. the absence of a given treatment or agent) and can include, for example, a decrease by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, or more. As used herein, \"reduction\" or \"inhibition\" does not encompass a complete inhibition or reduction as compared to a reference level. \"Complete inhibition\" is a 100% inhibition as compared to a reference level. A decrease can be preferably down to a level accepted as within the range of normal, e.g., for an individual without a given disorder. The terms \"increased\", \"increase\", \"enhance\", or \"activate\" are all used herein to mean an increase by a statically significant amount. In some embodiments, the terms \"increased\", \"increase\", \"enhance\", or \"activate\" can mean an increase of at least 10% as compared to a reference level, for example an increase of at least about 20%, or at least about 30%, or at least about 40%, or at least about 50%, or at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 90% or up to and including a 100% increase or any increase between 10-100% as compared to a reference level, or at least about a 2-fold, or at least about a 3-fold, or at least about a 4-fold, or at least about a 5-fold or at least about a 10-fold increase, or any increase between 2-fold and 10-fold or greater as compared to a reference level. In the context of a marker or symptom, an \"increase\" is a statistically significant increase in such level. As used herein, a \"subject\" means a human or animal. Usually the animal is a vertebrate such as a primate, rodent, domestic animal or game animal. Primates include chimpanzees, cynomolgus monkeys, spider monkeys, and macaques, e.g., Rhesus. Rodents include mice, rats, woodchucks, ferrets, rabbits and hamsters. Domestic and game animals include cows, horses, pigs, deer, bison, buffalo, feline species, e.g., domestic cat, canine species, e.g., dog, fox, wolf, avian species, e.g., chicken, emu, ostrich, and fish, e.g., trout, catfish and salmon. In some embodiments, the subject is a mammal, e.g., a primate, e.g., a human. The terms, \"individual,\" \"patient\" and \"subject\" are used interchangeably herein. Preferably, the subject is a mammal. The mammal can be a human, non-human primate, mouse, rat, dog, cat, horse, or cow, but is not limited to these examples. Mammals other than humans can be advantageously used as subjects that represent animal models of cancer. A subject can be male or female. A subject can be one who has been previously diagnosed with or identified as suffering from or having a condition in need of treatment (e.g. cancer) or one or more complications related to such a condition, and optionally, have already undergone treatment for the disease or disorder (e.g., cancer) or the one or more complications related to the disease or disorder (e.g., cancer). Alternatively, a subject can also be one who has not been previously diagnosed as having the disease or disorder (e.g., cancer) or one or more complications related to the disease or disorder (e.g., cancer). For example, a subject can be one who exhibits one or more risk factors for the disease or disorder (e.g., cancer) or one or more complications related to the disease or disorder (e.g., cancer) or a subject who does not exhibit risk factors. A \"subject in need\" of treatment for a particular condition can be a subject having that condition, diagnosed as having that condition, or at risk of developing that condition. As used herein, the terms \"protein\" and \"polypeptide\" are used interchangeably to designate a series of amino acid residues, connected to each other by peptide bonds between the alpha-amino and carboxy groups of adjacent residues. The terms \"protein\", and \"polypeptide\" refer to a polymer of amino acids, including modified amino acids (e.g., phosphorylated, glycated, glycosylated, etc.) and amino acid analogs, regardless of its size or function. \"Protein\" and \"polypeptide\" are often used in reference to relatively large polypeptides, whereas the term \"peptide\" is often used in reference to small polypeptides, but usage of these terms in the art overlaps. The terms \"protein\" and \"polypeptide\" are used interchangeably herein when referring to a gene product and fragments thereof. Thus, exemplary polypeptides or proteins include gene products, naturally occurring proteins, homologs, orthologs, paralogs, fragments and other equivalents, variants, fragments, and analogs of the foregoing. In the various embodiments described herein, it is further contemplated that variants (naturally occurring or otherwise), alleles, homologs, conservatively modified variants, and/or conservative substitution variants of any of the particular polypeptides described are encompassed. As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a \"conservatively modified variant\" where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid and retains the desired activity of the polypeptide. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles consistent with the disclosure. A given amino acid can be replaced by a residue having similar physiochemical characteristics, e.g., substituting one aliphatic residue for another (such as Ile, Val, Leu, or Ala for one another), or substitution of one polar residue for another (such as between Lys and Arg; Glu and Asp; or Gln and Asn). Other such conservative substitutions, e.g., substitutions of entire regions having similar hydrophobicity characteristics, are well known. Polypeptides comprising conservative amino acid substitutions can be tested in any one of the assays described herein to confirm that a desired activity, e.g. function and specificity of a native or reference polypeptide is retained. Amino acids can be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains (in A. L. Lehninger, in Biochemistry, second ed., pp. 73-75, Worth Publishers, New York (1975)): (1) non-polar: Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L), Ile (I), Pro (P), Phe (F), Trp (W), Met (M); (2) uncharged polar: Gly (G), Ser (S), Thr (T), (C), Tyr (Y), Asn (N), Gln (Q); (3) acidic: Asp (D), Glu (E); (4) basic: Lys (K), Arg (R), His (H). Alternatively, naturally occurring residues can be divided into groups based on common side-chain properties: (1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, His, Arg; (5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; (6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe. Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Particular conservative substitutions include, for example; Ala into Gly or into Ser; Arg into Lys; into Ser; Gln into Asn; Glu into Asp; Gly into Ala or into Pro; His into Asn or into Gln; Ile into Leu or into Val; Leu into Ile or into Val; Lys into Arg, into Gln or into Glu; Met into Leu, into Tyr or into Ile; Phe into Met, into Leu or into Tyr; Ser into Thr; Thr into Ser; Trp into Tyr; Tyr into Trp; and/or Phe into Val, into Ile or into Leu. In some embodiments, the polypeptide described herein (or a nucleic acid encoding such a polypeptide) can be a functional fragment of one of the amino acid sequences described herein. As used herein, a \"functional fragment\" is a fragment or segment of a peptide which retains at least 50% of the wild-type reference polypeptide's activity according to the assays described below herein. A functional fragment can comprise conservative substitutions of the sequences disclosed herein. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a polypeptide can comprise the first N-terminal amino acid methionine. In embodiments where a polypeptide does not comprise a first N-terminal methionine, it is understood that a variant of the polypeptide does comprise a first N-terminal methionine. In some embodiments, the polypeptide described herein can be a variant of a sequence described herein. In some embodiments, the variant is a conservatively modified variant. Conservative substitution variants can be obtained by mutations of native nucleotide sequences, for example. A \"variant,\" as referred to herein, is a polypeptide substantially homologous to a native or reference polypeptide, but which has an amino acid sequence different from that of the native or reference polypeptide because of one or a plurality of deletions, insertions or substitutions. Variant polypeptide-encoding DNA sequences encompass sequences that comprise one or more additions, deletions, or substitutions of nucleotides when compared to a native or reference DNA sequence, but that encode a variant protein or fragment thereof that retains activity. A wide variety of PCR-based site-specific mutagenesis approaches are known in the art and can be applied by the ordinarily skilled artisan. A variant amino acid or DNA sequence can be at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or more, identical to a native or reference sequence. The degree of homology (percent identity) between a native and a mutant sequence can be determined, for example, by comparing the two sequences using freely available computer programs commonly employed for this purpose on the world wide web (e.g. BLASTp or BLASTn with default settings). Alterations of the native amino acid sequence can be accomplished by any of a number of techniques known to one of skill in the art. Mutations can be introduced, for example, at particular loci by synthesizing oligonucleotides containing a mutant sequence, flanked by restriction sites enabling ligation to fragments of the native sequence. Following ligation, the resulting reconstructed sequence encodes an analog having the desired amino acid insertion, substitution, or deletion. Alternatively, oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis procedures can be employed to provide an altered nucleotide sequence having particular codons altered according to the substitution, deletion, or insertion required. Techniques for making such alterations are very well established and include, for example, those disclosed by Walder et al. (Gene 42:133, 1986); Bauer et al. (Gene 37:73, 1985); Craik (BioTechniques, January 1985, 12-19); Smith et al. (Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods, Plenum Press, 1981); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,518,584 and 4,737,462, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the polypeptide also can be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) can be added to the polypeptide to improve its stability or facilitate oligomerization. As used herein, the term \"nucleic acid\" or \"nucleic acid sequence\" refers to any molecule, preferably a polymeric molecule, incorporating units of ribonucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid or an analog thereof. The nucleic acid can be either single-stranded or double-stranded. A single-stranded nucleic acid can be one nucleic acid strand of a denatured double-stranded DNA. Alternatively, it can be a single-stranded nucleic acid not derived from any double-stranded DNA. In one aspect, the nucleic acid can be DNA. In another aspect, the nucleic acid can be RNA. Suitable DNA can include, e.g., genomic DNA, cDNA, or vector DNA. Suitable RNA can include, e.g., mRNA. The term \"expression\" refers to the cellular processes involved in producing RNA and proteins and as appropriate, secreting proteins, including where applicable, but not limited to, for example, transcription, transcript processing, translation and protein folding, modification and processing. Expression can refer to the transcription and stable accumulation of sense (e.g., mRNA) or antisense RNA derived from a nucleic acid fragment or fragments and/or to the translation of mRNA into a polypeptide. As used herein, the term \"detecting\" or \"measuring\" refers to observing a signal from, e.g. a probe, label, or target molecule to indicate the presence of an analyte in a sample. Any method known in the art for detecting a particular label moiety can be used for detection. Exemplary detection methods include, but are not limited to, spectroscopic, fluorescent, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, optical or chemical methods. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, measuring can be a quantitative observation. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a polypeptide, nucleic acid, or cell as described herein can be engineered. As used herein, \"engineered\" refers to the aspect of having been manipulated by the hand of man. For example, a polypeptide is considered to be \"engineered\" when at least one aspect of the polypeptide, e.g., its sequence, has been manipulated by the hand of man to differ from the aspect as it exists in nature. As is common practice and is understood by those in the art, progeny of an engineered cell are typically still referred to as \"engineered\" even though the actual manipulation was performed on a prior entity. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF polypeptides described herein is exogenous. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF polypeptides described herein is ectopic. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the synTF polypeptides described herein is not endogenous. The term \"exogenous\" refers to a substance present in a cell other than its native source. The term \"exogenous\" when used herein can refer to a nucleic acid (e.g. a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide) or a polypeptide that has been introduced by a process involving the hand of man into a biological system such as a cell or organism in which it is not normally found and one wishes to introduce the nucleic acid or polypeptide into such a cell or organism. Alternatively, \"exogenous\" can refer to a nucleic acid or a polypeptide that has been introduced by a process involving the hand of man into a biological system such as a cell or organism in which it is found in relatively low amounts and one wishes to increase the amount of the nucleic acid or polypeptide in the cell or organism, e.g., to create ectopic expression or levels. In contrast, the term \"endogenous\" refers to a substance that is native to the biological system or cell. As used herein, \"ectopic\" refers to a substance that is found in an unusual location and/or amount. An ectopic substance can be one that is normally found in a given cell, but at a much lower amount and/or at a different time. Ectopic also includes substance, such as a polypeptide or nucleic acid that is not naturally found or expressed in a given cell in its natural environment. As described herein, an \"antigen\" is a molecule that is bound by a binding site on an antibody agent (e.g., extracellular binding domain). Typically, antigens are bound by antibody ligands and are capable of raising an antibody response in vivo. An antigen can be a polypeptide, protein, nucleic acid or other molecule or portion thereof. The term \"antigenic determinant\" refers to an epitope on the antigen recognized by an antigen-binding molecule, and more particularly, by the antigen-binding site of said molecule. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide as described herein (e.g. a synTF polypeptide) is comprised by a vector. In some of the aspects described herein, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a given polypeptide as described herein, or any module thereof, is operably linked to a vector. The term \"vector\", as used herein, refers to a nucleic acid construct designed for delivery to a host cell or for transfer between different host cells. As used herein, a vector can be viral or non-viral. The term \"vector\" encompasses any genetic element that is capable of replication when associated with the proper control elements and that can transfer gene sequences to cells. A vector can include, but is not limited to, a cloning vector, an expression vector, a plasmid, phage, transposon, cosmid, chromosome, virus, virion, etc. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector is recombinant, e.g., it comprises sequences originating from at least two different sources. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector comprises sequences originating from at least two different species. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the vector comprises sequences originating from at least two different genes, e.g., it comprises a fusion protein or a nucleic acid encoding an expression product which is operably linked to at least one non-native (e.g., heterologous) genetic control element (e.g., a promoter, suppressor, activator, enhancer, response element, or the like). As used herein, the term \"expression vector\" refers to a vector that directs expression of an RNA or polypeptide from sequences linked to transcriptional regulatory sequences on the vector. The sequences expressed will often, but not necessarily, be heterologous to the cell. An expression vector may comprise additional elements, for example, the expression vector may have two replication systems, thus allowing it to be maintained in two organisms, for example in human cells for expression and in a prokaryotic host for cloning and amplification. As used herein, the term \"viral vector\" refers to a nucleic acid vector construct that includes at least one element of viral origin and has the capacity to be packaged into a viral vector particle. The viral vector can contain the nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide as described herein in place of non-essential viral genes. The vector and/or particle may be utilized for the purpose of transferring any nucleic acids into cells either in vitro or in vivo. Numerous forms of viral vectors are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of a viral vector of this invention include an AAV vector, an adenovirus vector, a lentivirus vector, a retrovirus vector, a herpesvirus vector, an alphavirus vector, a poxvirus vector a baculovirus vector, and a chimeric virus vector. It should be understood that the vectors described herein can, in some embodiments, be combined with other suitable compositions and therapies. In some embodiments, the vector is episomal. The use of a suitable episomal vector provides a means of maintaining the nucleotide of interest in the subject in high copy number extra chromosomal DNA thereby eliminating potential effects of chromosomal integration. As used herein, the terms \"treat,\" \"treatment,\" \"treating,\" or \"amelioration\" refer to therapeutic treatments, wherein the object is to reverse, alleviate, ameliorate, inhibit, slow down or stop the progression or severity of a condition associated with a disease or disorder, e.g. cancer. The term \"treating\" includes reducing or alleviating at least one adverse effect or symptom of a condition, disease or disorder associated with the disease or disorder (e.g., cancer, autoimmunity, genetic disorder). Treatment is generally \"effective\" if one or more symptoms or clinical markers are reduced. Alternatively, treatment is \"effective\" if the progression of a disease is reduced or halted. That is, \"treatment\" includes not just the improvement of symptoms or markers, but also a cessation of, or at least slowing of, progress or worsening of symptoms compared to what would be expected in the absence of treatment. Beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of one or more symptom(s), diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, remission (whether partial or total), and/or decreased mortality, whether detectable or undetectable. The term \"treatment\" of a disease also includes providing relief from the symptoms or side-effects of the disease (including palliative treatment). As used herein, the term \"pharmaceutical composition\" refers to the active agent in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier e.g. a carrier commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. The phrase \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be a carrier other than water. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be a cream, emulsion, gel, liposome, nanoparticle, and/or ointment. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be an artificial or engineered carrier, e.g., a carrier that the active ingredient would not be found to occur in or within nature. As used herein, the term \"administering,\" refers to the placement of a compound as disclosed herein into a subject by a method or route which results in at least partial delivery of the agent at a desired site. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds disclosed herein can be administered by any appropriate route which results in an effective treatment in the subject. In some embodiments, administration comprises physical human activity, e.g., an injection, act of ingestion, an act of application, and/or manipulation of a delivery device or machine. Such activity can be performed, e.g., by a medical professional and/or the subject being treated. As used herein, \"contacting\" refers to any suitable means for delivering, or exposing, an agent to at least one cell. Exemplary delivery methods include, but are not limited to, direct delivery to cell culture medium, transfection, transduction, perfusion, injection, or other delivery method known to one skilled in the art.

A system for controlling gene expression, comprising: Described herein are synthetic transcription factors (synTFs) and responsive promoters for precise, human genome-orthogonal regulation. Synthetic transcription factor proteins are minimal, modular fusions of DNA binding and effector domains that together can locally regulate the expression of genes at responsive promoters. They fundamentally couple engineered zinc finger (ZF) DNA binding arrays to transcriptional or epigenetic effector domains. The engineered ZF described herein are derived from native mammalian ZF scaffolds but re-designed to target specific 18-20 nucleotide sequences that are distant from human genome sequences; this feature confers reduced off-target binding potential in the human genome. The transcriptional and epigenetic effector domains include p65 transcriptional KRAB repressor. When coupled with engineered ZF arrays, they can locally regulate transcription at targeted loci in engineered cells (i.e. activating or repressing downstream genes). Corresponding responsive promoters are designed by placing instances of ZF binding sites upstream of constitutive promoters to enable precise and local gene expression control in mammalian cells. Described herein is a library of synthetic transcription factors that strongly regulate gene expression at their corresponding responsive promoters and minimally impact the expression of off-target genes in the human genome (see e.g., In the absence of a small molecule, the synthetic transcription factor is rendered inactive. In the presence of a cognate small molecule, the transcription factor can regulate expression of an output gene from a responsive promoter (see e.g., Induced Proximity Domains ABI/PYL induced proximity domains that are responsive to a small molecule (abscisic acid=ABA) can be used to regulate a synTF as described herein (see e.g., Liang et al. Sci Signal, 2011). The ABA-insensitive 1 (ABI1) and PYR1-like (PYL) domains originating form Arabidopsis thaliana have complementary surfaces that can conditionally interact when coordinated by the small molecule abscisic acid (ABA). ABA is a plant hormone that is naturally present at low levels within the human diet, and is subsequently presumed to be a safe small molecule for human administration. The expression of two fusion proteins\u2014one with the ZF DNA binding domain fused to the ABI1 (or PYL) domain and one with the effector domain fused to the PYL (or ABI1) domain\u2014permit separation of the synTF sub-domains, thereby rendering the local gene regulation functionality inactive. Subsequently, the administration of ABA can allow conditional dimerization between the ABI1 and PYL subunits, allowing the ZF and effector domains to remain locally coupled and retaining synTF functionality (see e.g., Translocation Domain ERT2 nuclear translocation domain, which is responsive to a small molecule (4-hydroxytamoxifen=4OHT), can be used to regulate a synTF as described herein (see e.g., Indra et al. Nucleic Acids Res (1999)). The human estrogen receptor (ER) contains a ligand responsive domain that, when fused to other protein domains, can yield ligand-dependent control over activity. The domain naturally associates with cytoplasmic factors in the cell in the absence of cognate ligands, effectively sequestering itself in the cytoplasm. Binding of cognate ligands, such as estrogen or other steroid hormone derivatives, cause a conformational change to the receptor that allow dissociation from the cytoplasmic complexes and expose a nuclear localization signal, permitting translocation into the nucleus. A mutated variant of this estrogen receptor ligand binding domain (ERT2) has enhanced sensitivity to certain \"orthogonal\" ligands (e.g. tamoxifen, (4OHT) is a selective modulator of the estrogen receptor that has been FDA-approved as a treatment for certain breast cancers. The expression of a fusion protein containing the ZF DNA binding domain, effector domain, and ERT2 domain permits cytoplasmic localization of the synTF, thereby rendering the local gene regulation functionally inactive, as the gene expression cassette resides in the nucleus/genome. Subsequently, the administration of 4OHT can allow conditional nuclear translocation of the synTF, allowing synTF functionality in the cellular nucleus (see e.g., Self-Cleaving Protease Domain Non-structural protein 3 (NS3) domain can be used for small molecule regulated control over synTF activity (see e.g., Lin et al. PNAS (2008)). The non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is a serine protease originating from the hepatitis C virus and is naturally capable of self-excision from expressed proteins. As such, the development of an expressed fusion protein with the NS3 protein domain placed between the ZF and effector domains permits auto-cleavage and separation of the synTF sub-domains, thereby rendering the local gene regulation functionality inactive. Many FDA-approved small molecules have been developed to target the NS3 protease and inhibit its cleavage activity as HepC therapeutic intervention strategies. Subsequently, the administration of one of these small molecules\u2014e.g. grazoprevir\u2014can prevent self-excision of NS3 from the fusion protein, allowing the ZF and effector domains to remain locally coupled and retaining synTF functionality. In the absence of a small molecule, the NS3 protease self-excises from the expressed fusion protein, rendering the synthetic transcription factor inactive through the separation of the DNA binding and effector domains. In the presence of a small molecule, the NS3 protease activity is inhibited and the fusion protein complex is stabilized, permitting the transcription factor to regulate expression of an output gene from a responsive promoter (see e.g., Induced Degradation Domain SMASh (Small Molecule-Assisted Shutoff) domain, which contains NS3 domain, can be used for small molecule regulated control over synTF activity. The small molecule-assisted shutoff (SMASh) tag is an engineered protein domain containing: the NS3 protease, a partial NS3 helicase domain, and a NS4A domain. All of the individual elements are derived from the hepatitis C virus. The combined arrangement of the NS3 protease with the partial NS3 helicase and NS4A domain led to a \"degron\" sequence, facilitating rapid degradation of the domain (see e.g., Chung et al. Nat Chem Biol 2015). The fusion of the SMASh domain to either the N- or C-terminus of a protein of interest results in its auto-cleavage and its separation from the protein, rendering the protein of interest expressed while the SMASh domain targeted for degradation. Subsequently, the administration of an NS3 inhibitor small molecule, e.g., grazoprevir, can prevent self-excision of the SMASh from the protein of interest, rendering the entire fusion protein targeted for degradation and thus the protein of interest is not expressed. The N53-containing SMASh protein has been used herein to post-translationally regulate activity of a synthetic transcription factor (see e.g., Dose- and time-inducible synthetic transcriptional activation of a fluorescent protein in human cell lines using ABI/PYL domains: Administration of a small molecule (ABA) led to temporal activation of a fluorescent protein output from a ZF-responsive promoter in Jurkat cell lines. Output fluorescence was measured as a function of several different ABA treatment concentrations as indicated (dose response; see e.g., Dose- and time-inducible synthetic transcriptional activation of a fluorescent protein in human cell lines using ERT2 domain: Administration of a small molecule (4OHT) led to temporal activation of a fluorescent protein output from a ZF-responsive promoter in Jurkat cell lines. Output fluorescence was measured as a function of several different 4OHT treatment concentrations as indicated (dose response; see e.g., Dose- and time-inducible synthetic transcriptional activation of a fluorescent protein in human cell line using NS3: Administration of a small molecule (grazoprevir) led to temporal activation of a fluorescent protein output from a ZF-responsive promoter in Jurkat cell lines. Output fluorescence was measured as a function of several different grazoprevir treatment concentrations as indicated (dose response) (see e.g., Administration of a small molecule (e.g., ABA, 4OHT, or grazoprevir) led to temporal activation of a fluorescent protein output from a ZF-responsive promoter in both HEK293 and Jurkat cell lines (see e.g., Inducible synthetic transcriptional repression of a fluorescent protein in human cell lines: Administration of a small molecule (ABA) led to temporal silencing of a fluorescent protein output from a ZF-responsive promoter in HEK293 cell lines. This decreased level of expression was compared to an untreated cell line which did not silence output expression (see e.g., Inducible synthetic transcriptional repression of a fluorescent protein in human cell lines: Administration of a small molecule (grazoprevir) led to temporal silencing of a fluorescent protein output from a ZF-responsive promoter in HEK293 and Jurkat cell lines. This decreased level of expression was compared to an untreated cell line which did not silence output expression (see e.g., Inducible synthetic transcriptional activation of a Chimeric Antigen Receptor in primary human cells: Administration of a small molecule (grazoprevir) led to temporal activation of a fluorescently-tagged chimeric antigen receptor (CD19-CAR) protein from a ZF-responsive promoter in CD4+ primary human T cells. This enhanced level of expression was compared to an untreated cell line which did not activate output expression. Output fluorescence as a function of several different grazoprevir treatment concentrations is also indicated here. Subsequent co-culture of these primary cells with CD19 antigen-presenting target cells resulted in T-cell activation, measured by enhanced production of cytokines. This enhanced level of cytokine production was compared to an untreated cell line which did not activate cytokine expression. Cytokine production as a function of several different grazoprevir treatment concentrations is also indicated here (see e.g., Inducible synthetic transcriptional activation of a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (in dual-drug regulated context) in primary human cells: Administration of a small molecule (4OHT) led to expression and secretion of IL4 cytokine from a ZF-responsive promoter in CD4+ primary human T cells. This system was used in conjunction with another small molecule (grazoprevir) regulated activation of a fluorescently-tagged chimeric antigen receptor (CD19-CAR) protein from an orthogonal ZF-responsive promoter. The ERT2-synTF was only responsive to 4OHT and was unaffected by the presence of grazoprevir. Likewise, the NS3-synTF was only responsive to grazoprevir and was unaffected by the presence of 4OHT. (see e.g., Inducible synthetic transcriptional activation of a Cytokine in Jurkat human cell lines: Administration of a small molecule (grazoprevir) led to temporal activation of a cytokine (IL10) from a ZF-responsive promoter in Jurkat T cell lines. This enhanced level of expression was compared to an untreated cell line which did not activate output expression. This inducible activation can be achieved through the delivery of separate lentiviral cassettes for NS3-synTF expression and IL10 production (\"double lentiviral vector\"), or through the delivery of a single lentiviral cassette expressing the NS3-synTF as well as regulating IL10 production (see e.g., Inducible synthetic transcriptional activation and tunable deactivation of a fluorescent protein in human cell lines using ERT2 and SMASh domains: Three Jurkat T cell lines were tested: (1) ZF-p65-ERT2 (no SMASh, see e.g., Tunable synthetic transcriptional activation of a fluorescent protein in human cell lines using ERT2 and SMASh domains: Two Jurkat T cell lines were tested: (1) ZF-p65-ERT2-SMASh (C-terminal SMASh) and (2) SMASh-ZF-p65-ERT2 (N-terminal SMASh). Co-administration of varying amounts of an ERT2-responsive small molecule (4OHT) and SMASh-responsive small molecule (GZV) for 4 days led to varying levels of temporal activation of a fluorescent protein from a ZF-responsive promoter. Absence or minimal 4OHT in all conditions led to little-to-no activation. Presence or near-maximal led in all conditions led to little-to-no activation. Presence of 4OHT AND absence of GZV leads to maximal activation. C-terminal and N-terminal SMASh variants exhibited differential sensitivities to GZV concentration (see e.g., Inducible synthetic transcriptional repression of a fluorescent protein in human cell lines using ERT2 & SMASh domains: Three Jurkat T cell lines were tested: (1) KRAB-ZF-ERT2-SMASh; (2) HP1a-ZF-ERT2-SMASh; and (3) EED-ZF-ERT2-SMASh. Administration of an ERT2-responsive small molecule (4OHT) for 6 days led to temporal repression of a fluorescent protein from a ZF-responsive promoter in all cell lines. Absence of a SMASh-responsive small molecule (GZV) in the negative control led to significant \"leaky\" repression in the absence of 4OHT (see e.g., Cells activate precise gene expression programs in response to multifactorial chemical and biological stimuli. The purposeful manipulation of this process is a principal goal of synthetic biology, and its application to human cells can lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of human biology and in the development of next-generation diagnostics and therapeutics that respond in sophisticated ways to disease. Indeed, diverse applications, from basic studies of oncoproteins to cell reprogramming to cell therapy development, demand precise and tunable control of gene expression outputs in response to input signals. Unfortunately, tools to artificially control gene expression in mammalian cells have significant limitations, greatly constraining the ability to study fundamental biological processes and engineer designer cell-based therapies. The most widely-used tools are older generation technology, derived from bacterial transcriptional systems; these impose restrictions on the number of genes that can be simultaneously controlled, are not tunable, and cannot flexibly integrate new input signals. As a consequence, researchers are unable to create sophisticated gene expression controllers that can flexibly sense and integrate biochemical signals (e.g. ligands, chemical inducers, morphogenetic cues), and correspondingly produce tunable activation profiles. Among the many biomedical applications that would be transformed by these precision gene expression controllers in mammalian cells is the development of cell-based therapeutics for cancer, autoimmunity, and regenerative medicine, which can suffer from issues related to over-activation and tissue specificity. Described herein are compositions, methods, and systems for controlling gene expression control in mammalian cells. Described herein is an expansion of the \"signal processing\" capacity of designer human cells to enhance their specificity, control, and activity for desired biomedical applications. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the central hypothesis is that this expanded signal processing can be achieved using cooperative, combinatorial transcriptional regulation schemes, in lieu of current gene expression systems that are based on \"simple\", one-to-one regulation. Such a hypothesis is based on the observation that in metazoa, signals are processed and integrated using large, multivalent transcription factor (TF) complexes that cooperatively assemble to activate gene expression. Described herein is an information-processing module for mammalian gene expression control. Functionality is demonstrated in human primary immune cells because of the fundamental role that they play in human physiology and their use in cellular immunotherapy. Described herein are inducible controllers regulated by orthogonal, FDA-approved drugs. The controllers are expressed by standard viral vectors, and they are demonstrated to drive regulated expression of reporters or gene products (synTFs and cytokines) of therapeutic importance for autoimmunity and cancer. Accordingly, described herein are mammalian-optimized, cooperatively self-assembling synthetic transcription factors (synTFs) and drug-inducible controllers of mammalian gene expression. Such drug-inducible controllers permit precision gene expression control across mammalian systems. In addition to expanding the sense-and-response capabilities of engineered human cells for improving cellular therapies, such controllers are broadly useful for basic biomedical research. This includes permitting drug-inducible, temporal control over multiple gene products simultaneously (e.g. oncoproteins or reprogramming factors).Gene Expression Control Systems: Promise and Limitations. The purposeful manipulation of information flow in living systems is the ultimate goal of synthetic biology, and its application to human cells can lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of human biology and in the development of next-generation diagnostics and therapeutics. In particular, gene expression technologies have played a vital role in regulating such information flow in cells for a wide range of applications. For example, the developmental process to form organoids is genomically encoded in stem cells in the form of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Manipulation of GRNs through gene expression control circuits has proven to be fruitful in programming and guiding morphogenesis in vitro. In animal model development, tissue-specific and small molecule inducible promoters are often used to achieve organ-specific and temporal control of gene expression. Furthermore, the c-fos promoter has been used to functionally label activated neurons in mice and control the expression of an optogenetic channel rhodopsin protein to artificially recall fear memory with light stimulation. Finally, ectopic overexpression of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), fusions of an antigen-specific scFv and T cell signaling domains, in human T cells can redirect their specificity toward cancer, with high efficacy against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in recent clinical trials. While current gene expression technologies have led to fundamental and therapeutic breakthroughs, their shortcomings are also abundant. For instance, the inefficiency of cell reprogramming from induced pluripotent stem cells is often attributed to key proteins and transcription factors not being expressed at the right concentrations and times. Also, the c-fos promoter is known to have variable activity in different neurons, rendering it unusable in many applications. Furthermore, many off-target effects have been documented for tissue-specific promoters, thus confounding data interpretation. Lastly, while promising, cellular immunotherapy has also shown (fatal) adverse side effects often due to a combination of issues related to cell specificity, over-activation, and unexpected interactions with the native immune system and tissue microenvironments. Cumulatively, the aforementioned issues are the result of fundamental limitations in current gene expression control systems, which has restricted researchers' abilities to engineer sophisticated \"signal processing\" into mammalian cells. First, the number of transcriptional control systems in use is small, exacerbated by the existence of one well-developed and widely-used chemically inducible gene expression system (TetR-based tTa). This means that researchers can only reliably conditionally induce one gene product at a time in mammalian cells. Second, the systems are virtually all derivatives of canonical microbial transcriptional systems (e.g. TetR). While highly active, these systems have fixed response profiles, and strategies for predictively reshaping their activation profiles to precisely tune how a therapeutic protein is produced are non-trivial. Thus, whether designing cell-autonomous or exogenously inducible controllers, current tools cannot flexibly integrate novel input signals and produce customized transcriptional programs (outputs) for desired applications. Described herein is a powerful information-processing module for mammalian gene expression control. The synTF framework is compatible for human cell engineering applications: it is composed of small, entirely human-derived protein domains that are highly tunable and is easily delivered using established viral vectors. Functionality is demonstrated in human primary immune cells because of their importance to human physiology and their use in cellular immunotherapy. To showcase its flexibility and generalizability, this core system is used as the basis of constructing different types of useful gene expression controllers in engineered immune cells, such as inducible controllers that are exogenously controlled by administration of orthogonal, FDA-approved drugs. These controllers are linked to the production of therapeutic genes (synTFs and cytokines), thereby informing applications of the controllers to enhance signal processing features (increased specificity, control and activity) of next-generation cellular therapeutics for cancer, autoimmunity and regenerative medicine. Key innovations include a new class of synthetic TF systems specifically optimized for mammalian cell regulation, with the following characteristics: human-derived components, compact genetic payloads for facile delivery using established viral vectors, modular domains with tunable molecular properties, and specific regulation that is orthogonal to the native transcriptome. Also described herein is a set of new and orthogonal drug-inducible gene expression systems for mammalian cells, demonstrated to allow tunable control of synTF and cytokine production in human primary immune cells. Current tools for controlling gene expression in mammalian cells are severely limited. Creating new precision gene expression controllers in human cells requires development of transcriptional systems (1) with an expanded set of orthogonal DNA-binding moieties, (2) that are responsive to safe deliverable chemicals beyond tetracycline antibiotics, and (3) that permit highly tunable activation/response profiles. Described herein is the characterization a new class of \"mammalian-optimized\" synthetic TF (synTF) systems that fulfill these requirements. These synTFs are used in drug-inducible controllers to tune activation profiles of therapeutic gene products in human primary immune cells. Generation and Characterization of Mammalian synTFs Based on Orthogonal Zinc Finger Arrays Mammalian synTFs were developed for precise, effective, and orthogonal transcriptional control in human cells. The synTFs are based on artificial C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) arrays. ZFs are the most common DNA recognition motifs amongst natural human (and all eukaryotic) TFs. ZFs offer four key advantages as a basis for engineering artificial transcription control systems in human cells: (1) They are human-derived (unlike TALEs or CRISPR/Cas9) and thus less likely to elicit undesired immune responses. Indeed, older-generation ZF systems were shown to be clinically viable strategies for achieving long-term regulation of a therapeutic gene product in primates. (2) Unlike their bulkier counterparts (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9), ZF proteins are small (30-AA domain binds 3 bp of DNA), permitting compact genetic payload designs that are easily packaged and delivered using common viral vectors. (3) As described below, ZF-based synTFs have a modular design with highly tunable molecular properties. (4) ZF arrays with customized DNA-binding specificities can be engineered to generate diverse synTF-DBM specificities. ZF-based synthetic transcriptional regulators that target genome-orthogonal DBMs have yet to be developed for mammalian engineering applications. Generation and Evaluation of a Library of Mammalian, Orthogonal synTFs Described herein is a workflow arrays that target defined 20-bp DBMs, a length that in principle provides unique addressability in the human genome. The workflow leverages modular assembly and functional selection of 6-unit arrays from of 2-unit building blocks. Using this approach, a library of eleven 6-unit arrays was created with binding specificities chosen to maximize orthogonality to the human genome (see e.g., US Patent Publication US20180057838, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). We fused these arrays to human transcriptional effector domains (p65 activation domain, KRAB/HP1a silencing domains) to create humanized minimal synTFs (see e.g., Generation of synTF Affinity Variants as \"Parts\" for Design of Gene Expression Controllers Two orthogonal synTFs from the library (ZF1 and ZF10) that show exceptionally high in vivo activity and transcriptomic specificity were selected for further development. synTF/DBM affinity (Kt) variants for these synTFs were generated. Affinity variants serve multiple purposes. First, modulating synTF binding affinity is a useful strategy for tuning transcriptional output levels. To populate the mammalian \"parts\" toolkit, affinity series of 10 variants were generated for each synTF (see e.g., Tables 10-12, SEQ ID NOs: 122-180, 192). A combination of three strategies were used to generate ZF-DBM affinity variants spanning low nM-mid M: (1) Alanine mutation of conserved arginine residues in the ZF (outside of the DNA recognition helix) that mediate DNA phosphate backbone interactions. (2) Truncation of full-length 6-unit ZF arrays to 4-unit subarrays. (3) mutations both within and directly flanking the core DBM. The activity of these variants can be evaluated using the above-described in vivo reporter assay. Subsequently, affinities can be directly measured using in vitro binding assays. Briefly, ZF-MBP fusion proteins are purified for each variant. Fluorescence anisotropy (FA) binding measurements are conducted, performing a competitive titration of DBM species against a pre-bound FITC-labeled oligo probe harboring a single WT DBM. Binding curves can be obtained for the full set of DBM variants, and Kt values are extracted by fitting the data to a quadratic binding equation. The outcome of this work is a set of mammalian synTF \"parts\" (with measured DBM-binding affinities) that can be used to design gene expression controllers. Development of Drug-Inducible synTF Controllers and Testing of their Ability to Temporally Control synTF and Cytokine Outputs in Human Primary Immune Cells Described herein are inducible gene expression controllers responsive to orthogonal FDA-approved drugs, offering the ability to multiplex gene expression and permit temporal expression control over desired proteins in mammalian cells. Controllers were engineered by fusing synTFs with ligand responsive domains and their performance were evaluated in human T cells (e.g., primary T cell lines and Jurkat T cell line), which were chosen based on their established importance to human physiology and translational research. Precise control of gene expression in human T cells remains challenging, especially in primary T cells. Thus, establishing these systems in these cells provides a basis for applying them in other challenging cell types. The inducible systems were used to control anti-Her2 synTF and IL-12 expression. Anti-Her2 synTF T cells have shown promise in treating sarcoma in clinical trials, but can have devastating on-target-off-tumor side effects. Similarly, IL-12 has potent anti-tumor activity, but is complicated by dose-limiting toxicity. Therefore, regulated expression of anti-Her2 and IL-12 can improve their safety profile. Drug-Inducible synTFs Enable Regulated Expression Control of Therapeutic Gene Products in Primary Human Immune Cells To obtain control over synTF activity, a non-structural protein (NS3) domain was fused to a synTF (see e.g., System Design: Developing synTF controllers that are responsive to orthogonal FDA-approved drugs offers the ability to multiplex gene expression control. Described herein are engineered controllers that are regulated by: (1) 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT), a metabolite of the FDA-approved breast cancer drug tamoxifen that selectively modulates the activity of molecules fused to estrogen receptor variants (such as ERT2), and (2) GZV (as described above). 4OHT- and GZV-inducible systems were generated by fusing the ligand binding domains to two orthogonal synTFs. Human p65 was used as the activation domain, and expression of the synTF was controlled by a constitutive promoter (e.g., EF1-a). The inducible synTF was placed in the same pHR lentiviral vector as the corresponding synTF-responsive promoter driving a gene of interest. System Evaluation: Described herein are assays for GFP, synTF, and cytokine as well as assays for synTF activity in Jurkat or human primary T cells. The relative performance of the different genetic circuits in Jurkat T cell line can be evaluated by testing in human primary CD8 T cells. Jurkat cells were used because of their value to the understanding of T cell biology, and their ability to scale the assay pipeline at cost. Strongly expressing synTFs in Jurkat are similarly strong in primary T cells. Inducible synTFs were first characterized using GFP (or another detectable marker such as mCherry) as the reporter. The whole system was introduced into Jurkat T cells via lentiviral transduction with multiplicity of infection of 25 to ensure high efficiency, quantifying viral copy number (VCN) with qPCR. To characterize the inducible synTF controllers, cells at 5\u00d7104 cells each in 96-well plates were inoculated with lentivirus, and eight different drug concentrations were added spanning three orders of magnitude (e.g., GZV 0-10 M, 4OHT 0-1 M), and GFP expression levels can be quantified with flow cytometry (see e.g., To demonstrate translational potential, an inducible system demonstrating a larges dynamic range can be selected to control synTFs or cytokine expression in human primary CD8 T cells. Controller circuits can be engineered by replacing GFP with a therapeutic protein (e.g., anti-Her2 synTF or IL-12), introduced into human primary CD8 T cells via lentiviral transduction, and evaluated using methods as described herein. Briefly, using ROSETTASEP and SEPMATE kits (STEMCELL Technology), primary human T cells can be purified from leukopaks of anonymous male and female donors obtained from a blood bank. synTF expression levels in the presence or absence of inducer are measured by immunostaining for myc-tagged synTF, and IL-12 expression is measured by ELISA. To activate the synTF, 5\u00d7104 engineered T cells are mixed in 96-well plates with Her2 expressing K562 cells at 1:1 ratio. T cell activation is measured via cytokine production (e.g., IL-2 and IFN-g), cell killing, and proliferation. Cell killing is measured by the number of live K562 cells (e.g., fluorescently labeled) through flow cytometry. T cells constitutively expressing synTF or cytokine, and cells lacking synTF or cytokine are tested as controls. Each sample is performed in triplicate. Statistical significance between samples can be determined by student's T-test (two-tailed). Values of <0.05 are considered significant. To ensure reproducibility, each experiment is independently repeated >3 times.Example 3: Synthetic Transcription Regulation for Immune Cell Therapy Overview: Next generation cell therapies seek to create designer immune cells that can sense and respond to disease in sophisticated ways. Achieving this goal fundamentally requires engineered regulatory elements and circuitry that can be used to program human cell functions by processing complex environmental inputs and mediating precisely regulated expression of therapeutic agents. Towards this goal, synthetic transcriptional programs can interface with sense and response modules to enable new layers of regulation in cells (see e.g., To advance immune cell therapies beyond reliance on simple constitutive expression of therapeutic agents, there is a need for programmable genetic components that offer tunable and versatile regulatory profiles. Moreover, these components must themselves have properties that are compatible with the human therapeutic context, including high specificity, low immunogenicity, and deliverability. Engineered zinc finger (ZF) domains are promising moieties for transcriptional regulation in human cells as they are able to address aforementioned considerations. These naturally compact DNA-binding elements are ubiquitous in eukaryotic transcription factors. They have a modular design with programmable sequence recognition and customizable molecular properties. There has been extensive foundational work to understand the structure and programmability of these motifs to achieve useful gene regulatory functions. Described herein is a synthetic transcriptional regulatory platform suitable for applications in therapeutic gene regulation. A library of engineered ZF domains with recognition sequences that are unique and orthogonal to the human genome is engineered and utilized, and these minimal regulators are connected to drug-responsive domains to achieve controlled gene expression. This framework broadly permits sophisticated gene expression programs for immune cell therapy. Such a platform for synthetic transcriptional regulation of therapeutic genes can be used in T cells. These core transcription factors of the synTFs are highly advantageous for therapy due to their compact size and native derivation from mammalian systems. These factors were connected to small molecule-responsive domains in order to control their activity (e.g., in T cells) by administration of safe and/or FDA-approved drugs. Construction of Synthetic Zinc Finger-TF Library: A library of synthetic transcription factors was constructed utilizing engineered 6-unit zinc finger (ZF) domains with 18 bp binding motifs that are unique and putatively orthogonal to the human genome. The activity of minimal transcriptional regulators against cognate and non-cognate reporters was evaluated in HEK293 cell lines (see e.g., Evaluation of Transcriptome Response: Changes in cellular transcriptome response upon expression of our synthetic transcriptional regulators were measured in HEK293 cell lines. These global transcriptome profiles were compared to those of widely-used \"orthogonal\" DNA binding domains (e.g., Gal4, TetR) (see e.g., Development of Inducible Transcriptional Regulators: The transcriptional regulators were coupled to inducible domains to temporally modulate gene expression. Candidate inducible elements were selected that are responsive to small molecules that are FDA-approved drugs or known to be safe in humans. The dose- and time-dependent activity of the inducible transcriptional regulators was evaluated in both HEK293 and Jurkat cell lines (see e.g., Control of Immune Cell Function: One of our small molecule inducible regulatory systems (e.g., an NS3-regulated synTF) was utilized to temporally modulate the expression of a CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor in primary CD4+ T cells and to permit tunable production of cytokines upon cellular activation (see e.g., Therapeutic cells can be engineered to sense and respond to disease in sophisticated ways. Cells are naturally capable of integrating and processing diverse environmental signals. Cells are naturally perceptive and adaptable devices that process information across space and time using their underlying genetic and epigenetic programs. Artificial genetic programs can endow human cells with new and increasingly complex therapeutic functions. The field of synthetic biology has really contributed to all of these areas: (1) from developing strategies to identify diverse signals (e.g. artificial receptors, responsive proteins), (2) new platforms and cellular logic modules to interpret information (e.g. transcriptional networks, signaling cascades), and (3) translating these into desirable and effective responses and therapeutic outputs (e.g. corrective transgenes, stimulatory molecules). By engineering human cells with genetic programs, the cells are presented with new opportunities to integrate and process signals associated with disease, and to ultimately therapeutically respond in sophisticated ways. Transcription factors (TFs) naturally regulate cellular behaviors. New genetic elements can advance the signal processing capabilities of therapeutic cells. With regard to information processing, transcription factors are often utilized as key mediating regulatory elements within circuits and genetic programs, due to their intrinsic ability to locally and conditionally the regulate expression of genes. TFs fundamentally govern genomic processes and interesting cellular behaviors (e.g., potent gene activation and silencing, differentiation, enhancers, etc.) These complex behaviors often emerge due to unique TF features in eukaryotic contexts (e.g., specificity for enhancer sequences, ability to modify DNA structure and chromatin, ability to interact cooperativity, ability to regulate different genes temporally and in sequence, etc.). Historically, heterologous TFs have been co-opted from prokaryotic systems (e.g., Gal4, TetR, Lad and others) to \"orthogonally\" control programs in human cells. While this itself has permitted many significant foundational advancements in the mammalian synthetic biology field, there are a relatively limited amount of regulatory properties and useful behaviors that these \"primitive\" parts can be used to uncover. There remains a persistent need for new regulatory elements that can allow cells to process more channels of information in more reliable ways. Synthetic transcriptional regulation can permit controllable expression. Described herein are artificial eukaryotic TFs with customizable properties, including an exploration of how engineered cooperative interactions between such TFs can give rise to complex signal processing behaviors. Engineered genetic components can be used for precise and versatile transcriptional regulation in human cells. Regarding the development of next-generation regulatory elements for therapeutic applications in human cells, the following are favorable properties of such TFs. Such synthetic transcription factors meet the following requirements: (1) components derived from mammalian systems that are safe and non-immunogenic, (2) those that can very specifically recognize and regulate at their operator sequences with minimal off-target effects, (3) those that allow for programmable and tunable interactions with other molecular components, and (4) those that can be successfully delivered in human cells within established delivery vectors. Engineered ZF domains are promising moieties for transcriptional regulation that address all of these considerations\u2014they are naturally occurring, minimal DBDs in human TFs, and they can be adapted for synthetic regulation. Engineered zinc finger domains can be used to build synthetic transcriptional regulators that can enhance the processing capabilities of human cells. A set of artificial 6-unit ZF domains were developed that specifically recognize 18 bp DNA operators; they are distant from and orthologous to native human genomic sequences. Simple transcription regulation programs were developed by coupling these engineered binding domains to human-derived effector domains and developing responsive promoters. These programs can be interfaced in therapeutic circuits\u2014generating inducible synTFs that are responsive to small molecules and using these controllable synTFs to modulate expression of therapeutic outputs. Synthetic transcriptional operator sequences were identified that are orthogonal to the human genome. There exist specific challenges in programming ZF domains compared to other technologies (e.g., TALE, CRISPR) for which there is a convenient 1:1 recognition code. One ZF unit specifies 3 bp of DNA and they can be connected modularly to specify larger sequence arrays. However, there can be context-dependent activity when these ZF units are arranged within larger arrays. To address the two-fold challenge of finding genome-orthogonal recognition sequences AND functional and active DNA binding domains, a set of 2-unit ZF subarrays was used (see e.g., J. Keith Joung (ZF Archive); U.S. Pat. No. 10,138,493 (2018)). 6 bp recognition sequences were identified that were underrepresented in the genome. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it was hypothesized that their concatenation would lead to highly distant 18 bp sequences (a length that can confer uniqueness). Arrangements of corresponding 6-unit ZFs were then screened to find those that could recognize these sequences, resulting in an initial library of 11 sequences (\"operators\") and corresponding 6-unit ZFs. A bioinformatic string matching algorithm called \"Biostrings\" was used to evaluate the occurrence of the operator sequences in the human genome. The synthetic operators were compared to several canonical TF operator sequences (e.g., UAS/Gal4, TetO/TetR, ZFHD1). The synthetic operators generated through the described workflow performed better relative to these \"heterologous\" recognition sequences of similar or shorter lengths (see e.g., Described herein is a library of synthetic operator sequences and cognate transcription factors. Responsive cell lines were developed by placing synthetic operator sequences upstream of minimal promoters driving a fluorescent output, and integrating them into HEK cells. The responsive (i.e., reporter) cell lines were then transiently transfected with minimal synthetic transcription factors composed of the engineered binding domains coupled to human-derived effector domains (such as p65). These proteins were capable of binding to the array and subsequently boosting expression of the fluorescent output. Each reporter was only turned on in the presence of its corresponding synTF, and not in the negative control case using a \"mock TF\" with a GFP replacing the ZF domain. Testing of the mutual orthogonality of this set demonstrated that the TFs were specific to their corresponding operators and not for non-cognate sequences (see e.g., Transcriptome measurements were used to elucidate synTF specificity and genome-wide activity. The specificity and genome-wide orthogonality of our synTFs were empirically evaluated in the human genome. A singly-integrated HEK cell line constitutively expressed a synTF alongside its cognate fluorescent reporter. Total RNA was collected and a transcriptome analysis was performed to examine into the on-target regulation of the fluorescent transcript compared to off-target misregulation. These differential expression levels were compared relative to a reference line containing a GFP-p65 \"mock\" TF. There was significant differential activation of the mCherry in the synTF cell line, but extremely high correlation of native cellular transcripts between both cell lines, indicating that the synTFs regulate expression specifically at their target sites (see e.g., As described herein, small molecule inducible regulation is useful for control of synTF activity. Drug-controllable versions of the synthetic transcription regulators were engineered by generating TFs responsive to the presence and concentration of relevant small molecules. These are useful for tunable and temporal control over the activity of the TFs. Reporters and synTFs were ported into lentiviral cassettes that were capable of delivering these payloads to various cell types. Three safe and/or FDA approved small molecules were used control the activity of the synTFs through different mechanisms; these mechanisms included: (1) the abscisic acid mediated hetero-dimerization of ABI/PYL domains; the 4-hydroxytamoxifen mediated nuclear translocation of the ERT2 domain; and (3) the grazoprevir mediated stabilization of the viral NS3 self-excising protease. Three of the orthogonal synTF activators were connected to each inducible system (see e.g., Tunable gene activation was achieved using small molecule inducible synTFs. Inducibility profiles were determined for each of the three inducible synTF activators, in both HEK293 and Jurkat cell lines. The reporter expression was evaluated across time and varying drug concentrations. Day 4 represented the highest levels of expression that were assayed, indicating strong inducible expression in drug-treated lines relative to untreated cell lines (see e.g., Tunable gene silencing can also be achieved using small molecule inducible synTFs. Inducible synTFs were engineered that were capable of repressing gene expression. The responsive promoter was modified to constitutively express a fluorescent output. The p65 activation domain was replaced with a KRAB repression domain (human-derived silencer), and the same ZF-drug pairs were utilized as the synTF activators. Inducibility profiles were determined for each of the three inducible synTF repressors in HEK cell lines, and there was strong silencing of reporter expression over time in drug-treated lines relative to untreated cell lines (see e.g., Inducible synTFs can regulate cytokine expression from a single lentiviral vector, demonstrating of the compact nature of the synTFs. A single lentiviral vector was engineered that was capable of expressing a grazoprevir-inducible synTF that would in turn regulate expression of IL-10. The size of this entire insert including expression elements was 3.5 kB, which is minimal and approaches the total payload packaging limits of certain vectors. Virus was produced to infected Jurkat cells, and there was saw strong induced expression of IL-10 in transduced cells after 2 days of grazoprevir administration, indicating that this is an efficient strategy of modulating therapeutic outputs in human cells (see e.g., Inducible synTFs can regulate synTF expression in primary cells. The grazoprevir-inducible synTF was used to control expression of a CD19-CAR in primary CD4+ cells. Using different administered concentrations of drug, dose-dependent expression of synTF was measured over time. On day 3 there was strong fold induction with the highest concentration. The grazoprevir-induced cells were then co-cultured with CD19+ antigen-presenting cells to activate the primary cells, and dose-dependent production of IFNgamma and IL-2 cytokines was subsequently measured across time. Such results highlight that the ability to reliably control expression of outputs from therapeutic, thus controlling their functionalities in increasingly complex settings (see e.g., In conclusion, building new transcriptional regulatory elements with favorable properties allows human cells to process information and regulate therapeutic functions in tunable and reliable ways. A library of orthogonal ZF binding domains and synthetic operator sequences was specifically developed, and these were used to engineer minimal transcriptional regulatory programs. As shown herein, these synTFs were used control therapeutic programs in circuits, thus demonstrating the utility of these synTFs in sophisticated gene expression programs.Example 5: Exemplary Sequences Induced Proximity Domains [ABI]-[ZF]-[2A]-[p65]-[PYL] synthetic transcriptional activator: In this particular embodiment, the ZF is fused to the C-terminal of the ABI domain, while the p65 is fused N-terminal to the PYL domain.
