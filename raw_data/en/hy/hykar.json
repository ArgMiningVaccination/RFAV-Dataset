A University of Mississippi Medical Center student gave him the one-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, protecting him from a virus that has killed or severely sickened people in his life. \"I was in the clinic trying to get this dental work, and they said the shot was free. I thought, why not get it? I'm 50,\" Brothers said. \"I have a friendgirl who had it (the virus). She was hospitalized for a month and a half, but she made it through. I don't need COVID.\" Brothers recently moved into a halfway house in the city. He's one of dozens of metro-area residents who came to the student-run clinic Saturday for one or more services: primary care, psychiatric treatment, dental work or the COVID-19 shot. About 45 people made appointments to get the vaccine, but students had an extra 25 doses on hand for walk-ups. \"For our patients, this is an incredible opportunity,\" said Michael Hohl, a third-year medical student and the clinic's director of research and education. \"They lack the ability to get to facilities that seem easy for us to get to. They're already receiving care here. This means the world to them.\" The Jackson Free Clinic offers non-emergency medical and dental care for acute and chronic conditions, including evaluation, testing, prescription drugs and education, to individuals who cannot pay. Students from the schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Pharmacy and Health Related Professions volunteer to work there every Saturday. At least one physician is always present to supervise care, but students do the work. UMMC provided the J&J vaccine \"because of the convenience of it being one dose,\" said Kristen Callahan, a project manager in the Medical Center's adult ambulatory operations. She and several other Medical Center employees were on hand at the Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard clinic to lend support. \"The patient population here changes every week. We wanted to make sure no one missed a second dose. A lot of our patients here don't have a medical home.\" Medical students began vaccinating patients at 9 a.m. By 10:30, the room where patients sat in socially distanced folding chairs waiting their turn - usually used for physical and occupational therapy - was buzzing with activity. \"It's the Room of Requirement,\" said first-year medical student Rachael Pace, referencing the magical sanctuary that any Harry Potter fan would know. First-year medical student Reagan Moak helped coordinate the flow of patients in and out of the clinic. She and first-year medical student Ariel Wilson serve as the clinic's co-communications directors. \"It's really incredible to get such a diverse community here,\" Moak said. \"I'm glad we can be the outlet for them, and to give them hope. They would have had a lot of trouble getting an appointment somewhere else. They're not plugged in. They're not on the Internet.\" James Davis of Brandon found out about the free vaccinations from his sister. \"I figured I might as well,\" he said. \"I want to get back to normal. I want to go to ballgames. \"I don't want to get that COVID. There's a big chance of kicking the bucket if you get it.\" When he sat at one of three vaccine stations, sleeve rolled up and ready to get his shots, he first answered a series of questions to make sure he was a good candidate. \"Just relax,\" first-year medical student Sydney Hays told him right before she stuck the needle in his upper arm. \"All right! I'll put a Band-Aid on you now.\" Students will administer the vaccine again on Saturday, April 17 and Saturday, April 24 from 9 a.m.-noon. Those in need can make an appointment by calling the clinic at (601) 355-5161. It's obvious how much Moak and her fellow students care for their patients, people who are among the metro area's most vulnerable residents. \"This is the community that can't afford to have care if they get sick,\" Moak said. \"We want to be the people who look out for them. \"They are our brothers and sisters.
