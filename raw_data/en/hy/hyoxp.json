As mandated by section 26- 9(o) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes, DCCA describes the use of the Compliance Resolution Fund (CRF) by presenting individual overviews of the functions and activities of the various DCCA programs funded by the CRF, and provides a financial summary of the expenditures made from the fund including personnel and operating expenses, as well as re venues received. In addition, the report addresses the department's compliance with the reporting requirements contained in Act 100 (1999) regarding the statement of goals, objectives and policies. The CRF, in existence since July 1, 1996, evolved into the primary funding source for the various DCCA programs as the department moved its operations away from support by general tax revenues to funding by fees and charges generated by its various programs. Pursuant to section 26- 9(o), Hawaii Revised Statute s, fees shall be assessed and deposited into the CRF for the issuance of a license, permit, certificate, or registration, subsequent renewals, together with all other fines, income, and penalties collected or reimbursement of costs or attorneys' fees asses sed as a result of actions brought by the department. The director may use the moneys in the fund to employ and train hearings officers, investigators, attorneys, accountants, and other necessary personnel for CRF funded operations, and the fund shall def ray all other administrative costs, including costs of operating the supporting offices of DCCA. Any other activity related to compliance resolution may also be funded by the CRF. \"Compliance resolution\" means a determination of whether: (1) Any license e or applicant under any chapter subject to the jurisdiction of the department of commerce and consumer affairs has complied with the requirements of said chapter; (2) Any person subject to chapters 485, 467B, 514E, and section 485- 6(15), Hawaii Revised Statutes has complied with the applicable requirements; or (3) Any person has complied with the prohibitions against unfair and deceptive acts or practices in trade or commerce. By Fiscal Year 1998 -1999, five DCCA programs were part of the CRF: Business R egistration Division, Professional and Vocational Licensing Division, Regulated Industries Complaint Office, Office of Consumer Protection, and the Director's Office with its supporting offices of Administrative Services, Information Systems and Communications (ISCO), and Administrative Hearings. 1 Act 129 SLH 1999, effective July 1, 1999, expanded the CRF to include the Division of Consumer Advocacy, Division of Financial Institutions, and the Cable Television Division. Act 39, SLH 2002, effective July 1, 2002 merged the Insurance Regulation Fund, the primary funding source for the Insurance Division, into the CRF. 1 The Director's Office provides general policy and administrative leadership in supervising and coordinating the various department activities. Personnel management services are provided by the Director's Office, while Administrat ive Services provides programs with centralized budgeting, accounting, as well as centralized clerical services. Information Systems and Communications provides system and technical computer support services for the various DCCA programs. Administrative Hearings conducts formal administrative hearings for the department programs and various attached boards and commissions, administers the Medical Claims and the Design Professional Conciliation Panels, hears appeals of the State procurement code, and condu cts due process hearings for DOE under the Individuals with Disability Education Act (IDEA). 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 2 - Except for trust and special funds with dedicated purposes2, the CRF provides the sole source of funding for DCCA since calendar year end 2003.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS The overall CRF financial summary for FY 10-11 3 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $23,191,995 $8,276,617 $31,468,612 $31,906,092 The department's financi al strategy requires generally that revenue -generating divisions secure revenues to cover division expenses, and contribute equitably to overhead costs, while ensuring that anticipated major improvements are addressed and a portion of next year's operating expenses is available. This ensures solvency of the fund and continuation of mandatory services to the public. From the onset of the CRF, the department's primary fiscal goal has been to implement this strategy and, as a result, we have been very conser vative in our spending and adjusted our expenses so as to be consistent with projected 3 The CRF financial summary relating t o ADMIN (Director's Office, Personnel, Administrative Hearings, Fiscal and Administrative Services Offices and ISCO) for FY 10 -11 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $3,175,494 $1,714,118 $4,889,612 $465, 504 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 4 - revenues.

We have adopted the motto \"Upholding fairness in the marketplace\" to remind us of our responsibilities. We will endeavor to provide our customers with the best value for their money by continuing our efforts to find more efficient ways of providing our services that are also convenient for our customers, such as making more services available online. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 5 - ADMI N will continue to provide administrative support to the department's divisions so that they can concentrate on their respective specific substantive responsibilities. ADMIN will also continue to make a concerted effort to expand and improve the use and operation of information technology as a means to improve efficiency and effectiveness of our programs. We will continue our efforts to ensure that inquiries and complaints are responded to in a reasonable amount of time, and that our expenditures are aligned with our revenues.

Composition The division' s main office is located at 335 Merchant Street, Honolulu, HI 96813 on the second floor. It also has three Business Action Center (BAC) offices: One at 1130 North Nimitz Highway , Second Level, Suite A -220, Honolulu, HI 96817; one at 70 E. Kaahumanu Ave ., Unit 8- 9, Kahului, HI 96732; and one at 100 Pauahi St., Suite 109, Hilo, Hawaii 96720. In order to carry out the division's primary missions, the division is divided into four branches: (1) the Documents Registration Branch that includes the Busines s Action Center offices, (2) the Securities Compliance Branch that includes the Investor Education Program, (3) the Securities Enforcement Branch, and (4) the Office Services Branch which supports all of the other branches. The division's staff includes attorneys, investigators, securities examiners, securities registration staff, business center specialists, investor education specialists, business registration assistants, clerk -typists, legal secretaries, licensing clerical staff, clerical support staff and administrative staff. The Documents Registration Branch maintains the business registry for corporations, limited liability companies, general partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships conducting business activities in the State. In addition, the registry contains trade names, trademarks, service marks and publicity rights. This branch consists of the Documents Information Section, the Documents Processing Section and the Records Se ction. It also includes the Business Action Center. The Business Action Center (BAC) , as part of the Documents Registration Branch, operates business action center offices on Oahu, Maui and the Big Island that provide point -of-service information and as sistance to the public primarily to facilitate, coordinate and simplify the application process with the State for business, tax and employer registration and licensing purposes. The BAC accepts BREG filings and fees and also serves as an information clearinghouse that provides general information on county, state and f ederal licensing, permitting and filing requirements and assistance programs related to business or commercial activities. Services are delivered in -person at the center and via phone, e -mail, mail, fax, and 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 7 - Live Chat (an instant messaging system which allows customers on the Hawaii Business Express website to obtain real -time assistance from a customer service representative ). The Securities Compliance Branch handles the registration activities for the securities industry operating in the State. This includes the registration of securities broker -dealers, securities sales agents, investment advisers, investment adviser representatives, investment companies, securities offerings, and the filing of franchise offering circulars in the State. The branch is also responsible for conducting field examinations of broker -dealers and investment advisers in the State. The Division's Investor Education Program that provides investor education and fi nancial literacy outreach to the public is also part of the Securities Compliance Branch. The Securities Enforcement Branch enforces State laws governing the securities industry under the Uniform Securities Act, by investigating and taking legal action a gainst those persons and/or firms , both registered and unregistered, who violate these laws or evade them. The branch has also worked in conjunction with other government agencies such as the Securities Exchange Commission, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Office of Consumer Protection and the Insurance Division in DCCA, the Honolulu Police Department's White Collar Crime Unit, the State Attorney General's Offices, the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee, and other federal and state securities and law enforcement agencies. GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS - Documents Registration Branch The Documents Registration Branch is supervised by one branch supervisor and three section supervisors. It provides an invaluable service to the business community in assuring that the information on file is readily available, accessible, and current in order to support commercial activities in the State. Without the availability of this information to the business community, commercial activity in the State would be substantially impaired, since businesses depend on the information on record to support the extension of trade credit, commercial leases, real estate transactions and the delivery of financial services. The Documents Registration Branch processed o ver 240,000 documents during fiscal year 2011, which is an increase of 28 % from fiscal year 2010, and maintains the public registry of over 168,000 businesses, trade names, trade marks and service marks. The active files include business entities that hav e been on record with the State for over 100 years. Information is also retained for business entities that have been dissolved or cancelled. Minimal information must be kept for these inactive files for the purposes of research, litigation, real estate transactions, and general business use. The Documents Registration Branch maintains 9 databases, with over 5 million records per database and has one of the most popular online services in the state with over 6.5 million unique hits a year. As part of a n effort to make the Documents Registration Branch as convenient as possible for the public, we have been working to advance our computerized information systems so we can process and record documents with enhanced speed and accuracy. Recent system upgrades include modifying internet interfaces to be more user -friendly and working to automate additional pre -filing of annual report fields. It is the goal of the Documents Registration Branch to become one of the fastest, most efficient, customer -oriented business registries in the nation. To accomplish this goal, the branch has the following objectives: (1) review and implement policies and procedures designed to achieve a level of efficiency in 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 8 - processing document filings and information requests in a t imely manner consistent with industry best practices; (2) continue to modernize the business laws so that they track as closely as possible the most current versions of the best uniform or model laws; (3) enhance the information systems to improve retrieval, processing and recording of public filing information while protecting the integrity of the data system, and (4) develop more online services that are useful to many. The branch 's accomplishments and goals this year continue to be focused on actively looking at thoughtful ways to improve and automate online services for the public. The branch is one of the first business registries in the country with the technological and legal inf rastructure in place to allow both online incorporation and annual fil ings and it continue s to be one of the most efficient and technologically advanced registries. This year, the branch launched one of the first mobile applications in the country for business registration and the first state government mobile application for tablet and smart phone technology. The application utilizes an interface customized for touch screen technology and smaller phone screens, including large buttons and customized displays. The application provides for business name searches and the purchase of certificate of good standing and filed documents which are some of the most popular online services of the state. The application can be found at www.business.ehawaii.gov . This year, the branch continued to improve the documents online project that allows the public to purchase filed documents through an online webpage. About 9,524 documents were ordered online this past year. We have made an estimated 701,000 documents immediately available on line as of this past fiscal year. This saves the public time and money and increases convenient public access to the registry documents, especially to businesses on the neighbor islands. The branch is continuing to upgrade the interface of its web site that can be found at www.BusinessRegistrations.com . This year, our \"go green\" effort to increase our online adoption rate for annual report filings has risen to over 90% of the total filings by the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. The effort continues to save the Division over 600 pounds of paper and nearly $45,000 in postage a year. The increased online filing rate also reduces paper, postage and other costs for the consumer, helps keep our community green and reduces the division's manual handling, thereby allowing faster automated processing. In addition to annual filings, the branch currently accepts a total of 30 other online filings. We are working to add more online filings in the upcoming ye ar. All forms that the branch generates are now available online for the public to download. The branch also maintains its Hawaii Business Express website that allows customers to fill out one application via a single internet process which covers three different state filings: registration of their business entity with the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, obtaining a general excise tax number from the Department of Taxation and obtaining an identification number from the Department of Labor a nd Industrial Relations. The technological innovations and the work of the staff have also kept the processing times down to an average of 3 to 4 days and annual backlogs as low as 0 days. Business Action Center The BAC is supervised by a business cen ter specialist who is responsible for five business registration assistants and three offices. The BAC operates permanent business centers on Oahu and 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 9 - Kahului, Maui and opened a temporary office in Hilo in February 2008. These offices offer point -of- service assistance and information to help facilitate, coordinate and simplify the application process for those who wish to register with the State in the areas of business, tax and employment. Customers interested in starting a business receive one- on-one assistance with completing necessary business license and registration applications. Customers can also submit applications in person and receive certain temporary tax licenses and pay fees. With the popularity of online registration increasing through H awaii Business Express (HBE), the BAC also provides the support for \"Live Chat,\" HBE's instant messaging system accessible to online filers who have registration questions. BAC also provides e -mail, fax and phone support for HBE or any other filers. The BAC encourages online filing by referring customers to the HBE website and providing designated terminals in the offices for customer use. Online filing reduces the number of paper filings over-the-counter at BAC while also increasing processing efficienc y. In addition, BAC acts as a clearinghouse of information for broader business -related matters. In the case of other industry -specific licenses and permits, the BAC provides application forms and references for additional information from the respectiv e state, federal or county agencies. The BAC also provides general business start -up information and refers prospective business owners to a broad spectrum of public and private nonprofit organizations that assist new and existing businesses, and to business seminars and other training or entrepreneurial education programs. The goal of the BAC is to be the most responsive and helpful point -of-service business center for business registration and licensing assistance to as many businesses in Hawaii as poss ible. The BAC objectives for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, will be to: (1) continue to develop relationships with the business community; (2) explore better ways to accept business, employer and state tax registration filings from the BAC sites o n Maui and Hilo; (3) continue seeking ways to reach communities in need of business registration assistance and to market BAC's services; and (4) continue working closely with other state agencies (including cross -training) to help increase compliance with new laws. BAC continues to support the offices in Hilo, Maui and Oahu. In FY1 1, the BAC branch assisted over 19,400 customers over the counter or via phone, e -mail, fax, or Live Chat. In particular, Live -Chat assistance continues to be popular with ove r 675 chats per quarter in FY11. In FY11, the BAC strengthened its partnership with SCORE's Counselor's to America's Small Business program, where volunteer mentors now meet with BAC customers once a month at the Oahu office (the BAC now manages the appoi ntment scheduling). SCORE is a nonprofit organization partially funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration. It provides business counseling and mentoring services free of charge. BAC customers are paired with a SCORE volunteer, who may be an attor ney, accountant, marketing expert, business owner in the same industry as the BAC customer, or other expert, depending on the needs of the customer. SCORE volunteers meet in one -on-one sessions with the customer to offer advice. If no local SCORE volunte er fits the customer's needs, SCORE can find a volunteer with the requisite expertise through its nation -wide network of volunteers. These partnerships allow unique opportunities for small business owners to speak with experts on a one -on-one basis. In F Y12, the BAC plans to conduct more outreach with SCORE volunteers to reach other groups such as the Wounded Warrior Program for injured veterans returning from war- time service. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 10 - In addition, the BAC participated in workshops and counseling sessions throug hout Hawaii, many of which were with the military. The BAC regularly provides outreach services to Kapiolani Community College, the University of Hawaii William S. Richardson Law School, and military bases. It also participated in approximately 25 job and business fairs, workshops, and seminars in partnership with the Department of Transportation, the U.S. Small Business Administration, Enterprise Honolulu, and others, reaching an estimated 9 50 attendees. The BAC has also expanded our outreach activities to private educational institutions such as Heald and Remington colleges, while also assisting rural business programs like the KEY Project in Kahalu'u and the Kona Hawaii Community Federal Credit Union. The BAC continues to host the Hawaii State Bar Ass ociation volunteer lawyers' project where HSBA attorneys come to the BAC's Oahu office and offer free legal services to BAC customers each Thursday. This is one of BAC's most popular programs and BAC hopes to continue to offer and expand the program. GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND ACCOMPLSIHMENTS - Securities Compliance Branch The Securities Compliance Branch of t he division is supervised by a s pecialist who is responsible for the work of six examiners, five licensing clerical staff, and two secretar ies. The b ranch currently has approximately 91,000 securities salespersons and 1,380 broker/dealer firms registered to sell securities. In addition, the branch has 60 state registered investment advisory firms and an estimated 1,775 registered investment adviser re presentatives on record. The branch also processed an estimated 855 franchise offering circular filings and approximately 360 filings for the private placement of securities in FY1 1 and conducted 20 exams. The goal of the Securities Compliance Branch an d Securities Enforcement Branch is to become one of the most effective state securities regulatory agencies in the country. To accomplish this goal, the Securities Compliance Branch's objectives are to: (1) implement an ongoing comprehensive training program, ( 2) implement a regular field examination cycle for registered broker/dealers and state registered investment advisers, and ( 3) develop valuable investor education programs and materials that improve inves tor awareness of fraud, reach communities thr oughout Hawaii with investor education materials and increase investor education efforts for students throughout the State. With respect to investor education, in particular, we are currently in the process of (1) implementing rules and laws to take advantage of the new Dodd- Frank Wall Street Consumer Protection Act in order to apply for up to $500,000 in federal funds for state investor education efforts; (2) continuing our partnerships with nonprofit and state agencies to expand outreach throughout Hawa ii to Native Hawaiians, the military, labor unions and others; (3) continuing our efforts to keep our kupuna informed; (4) increasing investor education programs for our keiki; and (5) improving our website features and developing electronic media. The staff is beginning training on the new provisions of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Consumer Protection Act (the \"Act\") and the Commissioner has worked throughout the year to make sure the state of Hawaii's interests are included in national positions on the fi nal implementation of the act. One of the most significant changes in the Act for the states is that it expands jurisdiction of state regulators to investment advisers with assets under management of up to $100 million, thus increasing the states' examina tion and registration services to include larger and more complex firms. We will be working to accommodate the new demands on the branch and to get staff up to speed on the additional complexities. The Act also places 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 11 - limitations on notice filings for se curities violators. In addition, the Commissioner has worked with NASAA to advocate for a fiduciary standard for broker dealers to match that of investment advisers. This fiduciary standard for broker dealers continues to be a heated debate that has garnered the support of Senator Akaka. He continues to champion it as an improved standard to protect retail consumers. Staff continues to efficiently manage the volume of applications and renewals received each year and the number of pending applications f or broker -dealers , sales agents, investment advisers and their representatives remains very low. The f ield exam ination program continues to provide examinations of broker -dealers and state -registered investment advisers in Hawaii. Examinations of broker -dealers and investment advisers located on all islands throughout the State are being conducted on a continuing basis to provide onsite review of compliance with Hawaii law. The branch is also continuing its comprehensive training program for professiona l development of its securities examiners staff with an additional emphasis on the new requirements included in the Act . Currently, the branch is supporting training to have examiners get certified as Certified Regulatory and Compliance Professional s from the FINRA Institute at Wharton . The branch currently has two certified examiners and one additional staff member preparing to be certified. In FY10, the branch developed the comprehensive State Investment Adviser Guide to help firms understand the stat e law compliance requirements and the manner in which to prepare for a firm examination conducted by the branch. The guide was developed to help small firms with limited resources to better understand the compliance requirements. The guide has been produced with an interactive index and is placed on our website at http://hawaii.gov/dcca/sec/iag . NASAA has now shown interests in making a similar guide a national resource and we are looking to assist NASAA in that effort. Investor education continues to be an essential component of securities regulation, and we continue to expand our outreach to audiences through various community events across the state. The branch completed 36 investor protection presentations in FY11, and participated in 55 community events statewide in FY11, a 12% increase from the previous year, through which we reached an estimated 80,648 consumers in Hawaii in FY11. The branch maintains a strong statewide outreach program in five ta rget areas: 1) Seniors, 2) Working Families/Union Members, 3) Youths, 4) Military, and 5) Hawaiian & Other Ethnic Communities. Our educational presentations include information to help consumers detect and prevent securities fraud. Educating the public i s an important part of our efforts to fight fraud, as knowledgeable investors are able to make better investment decisions. In the past, the branch also partnered extensively with the Hawaii Council on Economic Education (HCEE) to support financial liter acy and investor education for our students via an interactive educational tool called the Stock Market Simulation (SMS) . The SMS program trains teachers on how the US financial market works and how to make wise investment decisions, and the teachers are then able to go back to their classrooms and pass on the knowledge to their students. During the spring of 2011, the program reached 59 teachers who reported their intent to use the SMS lesson plans for 2,306 students. Over the past 6 years, this program has reached nearly 896 teachers and 31,639 students. We very much hope to look to re - implement this program in FY12. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 12 - The branch maintains nearly 65 handouts, brochures, booklets, games, puzzles, CDs, DVDs, guides & mini- guides covering a wide range of i nvestor education topics from how to select an investment professional to how to avoid scams and fraud. We also have seven investor protection presentations and special large print handouts that have been notably popular with our seniors. GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS - Securities Enforcement Branch The Securities Enforcement Branch of the division is supervised by a Senior Enforcement Attorney who is responsible for the regulatory enforcement activities of four attorneys, one supervising investi gator, six investigators, and five clerical staff. The difficult nature and complexity of the cases being handled by the branch is increasing every year. Cases involving multiple respondents, multiple complainants, and multiple bank accounts are occurrin g with much greater frequency requiring extensive financial analysis . The branch continues with the implementation of a comprehensive training program to improve the quality and efficiency of the securities enforcement work. The program consists of: (1) cross -training with registration clerks and securities examiners of the Securities Compliance branch, (2) in -house training with panels of regulatory enforcement and legal experts from other regulatory and law enforcement agencies, academia, and industry, and (3) outside training classes and conferences. As previously discussed, t he goal of the Securities Compliance Branch and Securities Enforcement Branch is to become one of the most effective state securities regulatory agencies in the country. To that end, t he Securities Enforcement Branch's objectives are to: (1) investigate and prosecute state securities violations under the Uniform Securities Act; (2) intake complaints from the public and respond quickly and appropriately; (3) reduce case backlog; (4) inform consumers of enforcement matters and investment scams through participating in investor education; (5) develop and implement internal procedures that will improve the timely and effective resolution of cases, improving the branch's overall effec tiveness; (6) attend and develop training to keep professional staff current on emerging investigative techniques, legal analysis and trends in securities fraud and other securities violations; (7) draft and assist in securities legislation; and (8) work with the media to rais e public awareness . As a result of the enforcement work of the branch in FY11, the division issued two ( 2) preliminary orders to cease and desist with penalty recommendations of $4,000,000; obtained three ( 3) final orders, and issued eleven ( 11) consent agreements or orders, imposing $2,435,264 in penalties. During the past fiscal year, the branch collected $317,776 in fines and penalties. The securities enforcement branch has been involved in the litigation and settlements of major banks over the freezing of the auction rate securities markets, a market estimated to be over $300 billion. Hawaii has assisted the North American Securities Administrators' Association in the multi- state actions. Resolutions are pending. The Securiti es Enforcement Branch has continued with the implementation of an extensive and comprehensive training program that includes: (1) outside training in the form of seminars and conferences specifically aimed at improving skills , staying up -to-date with the increasing complexity of cases and achieving more effective regulatory actions, and (2) frequent interaction with regulators in other states and, particularly in specific areas including franchises and broker dealer operations. The training and interactio n have resulted in more focused enforcement , effective impact on the market and increased attention on the use of conduct remedies and monetary penalties. Currently, the branch is supporting training leading to the Certified Fraud Examiners designation fo r investigators ( 3 certified) and the Certified Regulatory and 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Business Registration Division (BREG) - 13 - Compliance Professional from the FINRA Institute for Professio nal Development for attorneys (1 certified). CRF FINANCIAL SUMMARY The CRF financial summary relating to BREG for FY 10- 11 is as follows: CONCLUSION The Business Registration Division continues to receive business filings, requests to purchase business documents, business registration inquiries, securities and franchise registration filings, securities and franchise inquiries and securities and franchise complaints that indicate an enduring need for the essential government services involving the business registry , business action center, securities law enforcement, securities registration and investor education outreach. The demand for the division's services has necessitated improved information systems to handle the workload, more sophisticated online support, increased training to improve the quality of regulatory oversight, increased personnel and constant attention and commitment to the changing, increasingly complex needs for service . In addition, the division has worked extensively with NASAA to assist in the national regulatory reform effort and to promote and advocate positions that best support Hawaii 's consumers.

CATV's primary function is to determine whether the initial issuance, renewa l, or transfer of a cable franchise is in the public's best interest. This determination is made only after careful consideration by CATV of the public need for the proposed service, the adequacy, efficiency, and reliability of service, and the technical, financial, and operational ability of the franchisee. After the issuance of a franchise, CATV's role in protecting the public interest continues. CATV acts to enforce the franchisee's obligations under the franchisee order and to ensure compliance with State rules and regulations relating to cable operators' practices and procedures. CATV continues to monitor the franchisee to ensure that the cable operating system is reliable and responsive to the public. Such reliability and responsiveness to the public's interest may be indicated by operators providing the widest possible diversity of information sources and services and enhancing communication capabilities for its communities by supporting public television, public, educational and government acces s and the interconnection of public facilities. CATV is cognizant of the increasing importance of cable service to the people of Hawaii. With advanced technology, cable systems are becoming more than strictly a source of entertainment, and increasingly serve as a means of providing informational and educational programming. Therefore, the Division recognizes that the extension of cable service to all communities within the franchised areas should remain a high priority. Included within the responsibil ity of overseeing all franchised wireline cable operators within the State, and as an integral part of the cable regulatory scheme, CATV responds to public inquiries, concerns, and complaints. CATV s taff are trained to assist, provide answers, refer the c omplaint to the appropriate cable operator in the franchised area, or otherwise inform the general public of complaint -filing procedures. It is the division's mission to oversee that all complaints and concerns are researched and result in some form of re solution. In furtherance of this goal, CATV will continue to monitor how customer service concerns are being addressed and to examine the degree of customer satisfaction by reviewing surveys and reports. The division will continue to encourage operators to develop new, improved, or more effective utilization of cable communications services and facilities that enhance customer based services to the people of Hawaii. In addition to overseeing system operators, CATV is also responsible for the expansion of the State's Institutional Network (\"INET\") in a manner that is efficient and effective for the State. The INET provides broadband telecommunications capabilities among government and educational organizations and is constructed for two- way operation as part of the State's current cable television network. The recent growth in information processing, storage, and retrieval by the State illustrates the increasing need for high transmission capacity with a more flexible network configuration which may be a chieved through the INET. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Cable Television Division (CATV) - 15 - In its franchise agreements with cable operators, the State requires that cable operators set aside a number of channels for public, educational and governmental access (\"PEG\") and provide a percentage of gross revenues for PEG use. The State has delegated oversight of the access channels and funds to non-profit entities located in each of the four counties. In 2010, the Hawaii State Legislature passed Act 199 (the \"Act\") which added broadband and telework responsibilities to CATV's responsibilities. Pursuant to the Act, DCCA/CATV convened a work group to discuss procedures for streamlined permitting functions applicable to the development of broadband technology, and the broadband assistance and advisory council to advise the department on broadband development and promotion related matters. CATV requested and received increased financial and personnel resources for FY11 as authorized by Act 199. As a result, two new staff members were hired as program specialists to focus o n the broadband- related duties of the department. DCCA/CATV broadband related activities have included drafting of legislation related to broadband development, meeting with government agencies, the Legislature, service providers and other stakeholders to address issues related to the advancement of broadband; and participating in FCC proceedings related to reforms affecting funding for telecommunications and broadband. Composition The staff of CATV currently consists of an administrator, a staff attorne y, three program specialists (1 cable television specialist and 2 broadband specialists) , and a secretary. The office is located on the first floor of the King Kalakaua Building at 335 Merchant Street. Mailing address: P.O. Box 541, Honolulu, address: www.hawaii.gov/dcca/catv . OBJECTIVES CATV's goals and objectives are as follows: 1) Ensure consistent cable television regulatory policies and practices - Conduct regularly scheduled franchise fee and PEG reviews - Designate access organizations to provide PEG access services - Collaborate on INET deployment - Convene periodic Cable Advisory Committee meetings 2) Monitor and participate in federal telecommunications legislation and rulemaking. - Continue working with Hawaii's congressional delegation on applicable federal legislation - Continue the division's working relationship with the FCC on DBS and other cable related matters - Continue to monitor federal issues that may have an impact to Hawaii cable television subscribers and broadband consumers 3) Advocate for equivalent DBS, and other enhanced services. - Ensure that DirecTV and DishNetwork comply with FCC order regarding service to Hawaii - Monitor development and deployment of new advanced services - Ensure that Hawaii receives equivalent service as does the mainland 4) Broadband 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Cable Television Division (CATV) - 16 - - Implement requirements of Act 199 (SLH 2010) - Implement the requirements of DCCA ARRA Broradband Mapping & Planning Grants - Continue to lea d INET initiatives - Facilitate the development of broadband infrastructure ACCOMPLISHMENTS Broadband - Act 199 (SLH 2010) - Act 199 tasked DCCA with new duties related to facilitating access to, competitively priced broadband services and to promoting use of such services. Among other things, it required DCCA/CATV to convene a Permitting Work Group to develop procedures for streamlined permitting applicable to the development of broadband services and technology. DCCA/CATV convened and chaired this group, which provided direction and guidance to the 2011 Legislature on legislation that was enacted as Act 151 (SLH 2011), which provides an exemption from certain permitting and approval processes for certain broadband infrastructure deployment. DCCA/CATV has also convened the Broadband Assistance Advisory Council as required under Act 199, and has called three meetings of the Council. The Council will address and advise the Department on various broadband-related issues and activities. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act - Broadband Mapping and Planning Project s - DCCA / CATV was awarded $4.3M in ARRA funds to be expended over a 5 year period ending December 2014. DCCA/CATV has partnered with the University of Hawaii (\"UH\") in carrying out the grant proj ects, which include the following projects: (1) Broadband Data Collection and Mapping; (2) Broadband Planning; (3) Broadband Capacity Building; and (4) Technical Assistance. Activities under these grants include data collection to develop and maintain Haw aii's broadband map to identify available broadband services throughout the State ; planning activities for broadband advancement as critical infrastructure; execution of plans developed to fill identified gaps in broadband service throughout the State and to reduce barriers to broadband access; and implementation of programs to increase broadband services and digital literacy. Institutional Network (\"INET\") - CATV continues its leadership role in the development, expansion and enhancement of the INET. Working with its INET Partners [( 1) the Information, Communications and Services Division (\"ICSD\") of the Department of Accounting and General Services, (2) UH and ( 3) the Department of Education (\"DOE\")], CATV continued its leadership role in the upgrade and expansion of the INET , under existing cable television franchises , in the deployment of broadband infrastructure for education and government applications. The interconnection of the islands of Oahu, Maui, Kauai and Hawaii via submarine fiber provides t he INET Partners with seamless, broadband networking capabilities between these islands. As of the end of FY 11 (June 30, 2011), TWE held approximately $ 2.7 M in an interest -bearing account on behalf of the DCCA for INET purposes and broadband activities . These funds are the result of an agreement between the DCCA and Olelo regarding cable television franchise fees that are collected from Oahu cable television subscribers. Oceanic Time Warner Cable of Hawaii (\"Oceanic\") - Hawaii Island Franchise Renewal - Oceanic submitted an application to renew its cable franchise for the island of Hawaii . CATV along with its consultant held numerous meetings with various stakeholders and groups seeking comments on the renewal of th is franchise. In addition CATV held four public meetings to ensure that the public had ample 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Cable Television Division (CATV) - 17 - opportunity to provide input into the renewal process. CATV and Oceanic are presently negotiating a new franchise a greement and we expect this process to conclude by year end 2011. Hawaiian Telcom (\"Hawtel\") Application For a Cable Television Franchise - On October 28, 2010, Hawtel emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and submitted a new application for a new cable franchise to CATV on November 5, 2010 and withdrew its prior application. On June 24, 2011, DCCA granted Hawtel a new cable franchise for the island of Oahu only to provide video programming services . Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) Service - CATV continues to be the State's advocate for DBS service and other non -wireline services that would benefit Hawaii residents. Although DBS is regulated on the federal level by the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"), CATV recognizes the importance of this service not only as a competitor to cable television service but also as a provider of unique services that Hawaii 's residents should have access to. CATV continues its advocacy with the FCC as well as with Hawaii's congressional delegation on matters related to these services . Franchise fee reviews and refunds - CATV has contracted with a certified public accounting firm to conduct annual reviews of the franchise fee payment process in each of the different franchise areas. Based on the results of reviews of the franchise fee calculation, collection, and payment process for all franchis e areas, DCCA ordered refunds to cable subscribers over the past 8 years, totaling approximately $1.4 million. CATV -DCCA is continuing these reviews periodically to ensure that the franchise fee collection process is being conducted accurately. Federal L egislation and FCC Rulemaking - CATV continues to monitor developments in Congress and at the FCC related to telecommunications, cable television and broadband, and has actively participate d in 2011 in FCC's proposed rulemaking proceedings related to the U SF and Intercarrier Compensation (\"ICC\") . DCCA/ CATV has filed position statements in the USF/ICC dockets on behalf of the State and has met and work ed with Hawaii's congressional delegation and the FCC. PEG Contracts - On April 27, 2011, Governor Aberc rombie signed into law Act 19 (SLH 2011) which authorizes the Director of DCCA to designate access organizations to oversee the development, operation, supervision, management, production and broadcasting of programs of public, educational or government ac cess facilities provided that the designations shall be exempt from chapter 103D (State Procurement Code). CATV is the division within DCCA that will be responsible for reviewing the applications and negotiations required for this designation process. The CRF financial summary relating to CATV for FY 10-11 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $366,963 $542,897 $909,860 $1,926,773 CONCLUSION The year 2011 was a remarkable year for CATV, due in part t o the rapid development of advanced technology by cable companies , and the additional responsibilities that CATV was given with respect to 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Cable Television Division (CATV) - 18 - Broadband. The continued enhancement of the fiber to node architecture provided increased bandwidth capacity for traditional services such as video programming as well as for new interactive and digital services. Thus, given the nascent nature of digital technology relative to cable, CATV had and presently has the continuing task of monitoring the public's present needs and future interests. Because of the rapid advancements in telecommunications, CATV seized the opportunity to provide a more uniform standard of practice within the State, offer improved services to meet the needs of the public, and provide greater rel iability and responsiveness without financially impairing the system operators. CATV will strive to ensure fairness to the public in the provision of cable television services. 2011 Co mpliance Resolution Fund Report - 19 - DIVISION OF CONSUMER ADVOCACY (DCA) website: www.hawaii.gov/dcca/dca/ e-mail address: consumeradvocate@dcca.hawaii.gov OVERVIEW The Division of Consumer Advocacy (\"DCA\") represents, protects, and advances the interests of consumers of utility and transportation services before regulatory agencies, primarily the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (\"PUC\") and the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"). The DCA reviews requests for rate and tariff changes, capital improvement projects, integrated resource plans, certificates for authority to operate, and other applications filed by public utility and transportation companies, in addition to other proceedings opened by regulatory agencies to investigate or review generic issues. In representing the consumers of utility and transportation services before the PUC, the DCA must analyze financial and statistical data, prior docketed material, industry standards, and the information provided by the utility and transportation compa nies to support their applications. After analyzing the information, the DCA generally submits either written statements of position or testimonies explaining its analyses, findings, and recommendations to the PUC. Oral testimonies by DCA analysts, subje ct to utility company cross - examination, are required when an evidentiary hearing before the PUC is scheduled to resolve differences among the parties to a proceeding. COMPOSITION The DCA consists of 14 employees, ranging from an administrator, a secre tary, a utilities/transportation officer, a utilities/transportation specialist, an education specialist, rate analysts, researchers, engineers, attorneys, and clerical support. The DCA is located on the third floor of the King Kalakaua Building, 335 Merc hant Street. Its contact information is as follows: mailing address, P.O. Box 541, Honolulu, HI 96809; phone number, 586- 2800; internet address, www.hawaii.gov/dcca/dca/. The majority of the DCA's professional staff is comprised of the Rate Analysis B ranch, the Engineering Branch, the Research Branch, and the Legal Branch. The Rate Analysis Branch reviews and analyzes economic conditions, investor requirements and returns, and other aspects relating to the capital structure of regulated public utilities and transportation companies. In addition, the Branch evaluates and develops recommendations relating to rate schedules, effects of rates, sales levels, and other pertinent considerations in establishing rates. The Engineering Branch analyzes and makes recommendations on technical matters such as production capacity and efficiency, depreciation allowances, maintenance cost factors, engineering safety standards, plans for capital improvements, purchased power agreements, and quality of service standar ds. The Research Branch analyzes and advises on matters imposed on regulated public utility and transportation industries, provides services and advice relating to the current operations of and evolving changes to regulated public utilities and transporta tion industries, conducts special studies on the changes in various regulatory areas, including energy and telecommunications, and assists and participates with other branches in developing data and conducting analyses on matters under examination. The Legal Branch provides legal representation before regulatory agencies. The branch also provides general clerical support by updating and maintaining the DCA's docket, general office, and 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 20 - electronic data base files, formatting draft documents prepared by the technical staff and attorneys for filing with regulatory agencies and utility companies, and maintaining the office library. Not counting the Legal Branch, the DCA is authorized to have up to nine exempt positions, under HRS \u00a7 269- 52(1). Pursuant to Ac t 130, SLH 2010, funding was provided to restore four of the exempt positions, as well as four of the civil service positions that were abolished by the 2009 Legislature. The DCA also has a staff level position - the Public Utilities/Transportation Specia list - that assists the Public Utilities/Transportation Officer in managing the overall workload pertaining to matters filed before the regulatory agencies, such as the PUC and FCC. In addition to providing analysis on docketed filings, the Education Spec ialist is responsible for consumer education and outreach, which is accomplished by attending various community events throughout the State to gain public input about specific issues affecting consumers and to provide information on utility services. The Education Specialist is also responsible for updating and maintaining the DCA's web site and publishing a quarterly newsletter. Given the D CA's historical difficulty in attracting and retaining staff, in 2008, the DCA received authorization to reorganize, tailoring the position descriptions to be better aligned with the position duties and work of the DCA. Since the restoration of the eight positions in FY2010, the DCA has completed revising the necessary position descriptions that would allow the DCA to recruit for these positions. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES The DCA's goals and objectives can be categorized generally in three broad areas: consumer advocacy, policy advancement, and consumer education and outreach. These areas are not mutually exclusive and often overlap; however, for purposes of describing the DCA's goals and how the DCA will reach them, the goals will be described separately. Consumer Advocacy Goal Ensuring that Hawaii's consumers receive fairly priced rates for safe and reliable services , while ensuring customer and environmental protections and renewable resource use , is the DCA's responsibility and primary goal. This goal may involve a balancing of competing interests. Planned Approach/Methods The DCA has and will continue to achieve this goal by advocating for consumers of regulated utility and transportation services wherever their interests are at stake. Typically, this occurs before the PUC, but may also be before other federal, State or local agencies and legislative bodi es. A majority of the DCA's resources will continue to be focused on PUC proceedings. These proceedings often may affect the rates and the reliability of utility and transportation systems and services. The DCA's participation in PUC proceedings will ty pically involve some or all of the following: 1. Review of applications to ensure compliance with regulations; 2. Participation at PUC public hearings; 3. Procurement of consultant services to manage workload and for complex cases; 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 21 - 4. Completion of discovery; 5. Analysis of applications and supporting documents to determine the accuracy and the reasonableness of the requests; 6. Provision of recommendations to the PUC on the merits of the applications through statements of position or direct testimonies; p rovision of oral testimonies, which are subject to cross -examination in proceedings where evidentiary hearings are necessary; and 7. Completion of related legal actions, such as filings of legal briefs, motions, appeals, etc., where necessary. The DCA also will remain flexible and willing to work with parties to proceedings to negotiate and settle proceedings or particular issues when they are in the consumers' best interest. Measures To measure the DCA's performance in advocating consumer interests, the DCA will continue to track various categories of information. Among others, the DCA monitors consumer savings due to its participation in PUC proceedings, the percentage of PUC decisions that agree with the DCA's recommendations, the number of service quality investigations it participates in, and the number of filings before the PUC reviewed by the DCA. Only some of the significant impacts that the DCA's participation may have upon consumers are easily measured. Those impacts that are not easily meas ured will generally be discussed below in the DCA's explanation of its policy advancement objectives. Policy Advancement Goal The DCA will remain active in promoting policies to protect and advance the interests of utility and transportation consume rs on the local, State, and national levels. Planned Approach/Methods In the PUC's generic, investigative, or policy proceedings, the DCA follows a similar approach to its review and analysis of applications. A typical investigative proceeding may in volve the following steps: After the DCA and other parties to the proceeding state their initial positions on the issues, discovery and analyses are done to determine the reasonableness of the other parties' positions; Technical meetings between the parti es are often held to discuss and educate each other on the issues and positions taken, and to determine where possible agreement may be reached; The DCA then provides the PUC with a recommendation that it believes is in the best interest of consumers; and 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 22 - Evidentiary or panel hearings are held by the PUC to take evidence provided orally by DCA witnesses or consultants hired by DCA to provide expert testimonies on specific technical issues. Specific ongoing investigative dockets are discussed later in this report. The DCA has monitored, and will continue to monitor, Congressional activity in the energy and telecommunications areas. The DCA will continue to maintain contact with Hawaii's Congressional delegation, particularly those members sitting on committees that deal with energy and telecommunications, and will continue to provide input where appropriate. The DCA will also continue to be actively involved and advocate for Hawaii consumers, through its membership in the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates (\"NASUCA\"). NASUCA is active before the FCC, Congress, and the federal courts in advancing consumer interests on national issues that impact consumers locally. The DCA will also remain actively involved with the State Legislature , which sets policy at the State level. The DCA advises legislators through testimonies that detailed consumer benefits or detriments of specific proposals the legislators were considering. The DCA has attempted to take a more proactive approach by worki ng with legislators and policy groups on the development of proposals, while maintaining a consistent policy position as advocated by the Governor's office. Measures Measuring the performance of the DCA's efforts to promote policy objectives is inexact . While the DCA tracks the percentage of its positions with which the PUC ultimately agrees, the measure does not capture the efforts throughout proceedings to educate and work with other parties to come to agreement on issues. The DCA can develop simila r measures (e.g., whether its recommendations are ultimately agreed with by those setting the policy) for the State and federal agency and legislative bodies, but similar challenges with the imprecise nature of the measurement is likely to result. Educati on & Outreach Goal The DCA's goal is to encourage the public to be wiser consumers of public utility services by, among other things, emphasizing the possible effects that their consumption habits may have on utility rates and the environment. It is through the education and outreach process that the DCA aims to gather consumer input on utility issues and to encourage consumers to be more involved in utility proceedings. In addition, consumers need to be aware that many of the benefits proposed under Haw aii's Clean Energy Initiative will not be immediately apparent in their bills. Thus, education of reasonable expectations is necessary to avoid misinformation from occurring. Planned Approach/Methods 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 23 - The DCA can accomplish its goal of positively affecti ng the habits of consumers on a statewide basis through the use of its web site and public outreach activities. The DCA established the following action plan to accomplish its goals and objectives: 1. Update and improve its website with consumer -friendl y and useful content; 2. Establish information booths and provide presentations at community events, such as home shows and public fairs throughout the State and build positive relationships with both business and individual community members; 3. Improve c ommunications with consumers and the public through expanded distribution and publication of its newsletter; and 4. Hold informational seminars or use public service announcements to highlight different utility issues and topics. Measures To measure th e DCA's performance and progress of its education and outreach activities, it will track the number of people reached through education and outreach events, newsletters and other publications distributed, and consumers assisted with complaints and other is sues. ACCOMPLISHMENTS In 2011, results of the DCA's efforts to protect and advance the interests of consumers were seen through its work on behalf of individual communities, as well as major utility issues that will have far-reaching impacts on people throughout the State. Several of these efforts are described below. Rate Cases Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.'s (\"HECO\") 2009 Test Year Rate Case On July 3, 2008, HECO filed an application for approval to increase its rates (by approximately $97,011,000, or 5.2%, over revenues at current effective rates) and to amend its rules. The DCA and the Department of the Navy were parties in this docket and offered analyses and recommendations for the PUC's consideration. As part of the rate case, issues related to management audits were considered. The PUC's final decision and order filed on December 29, 2010, which granted an overall increase of about $66 million or about a 5% increase over present revenues. There remain outstanding issues regarding whether it is appropriate to conduct an overall management audit of HECO or to perform more focused audits relating to certain projects in order to determine the amount that might be recoverable from ratepayers. The DCA's recommendation was that rather than requir e a general management audit, the ratepayers and the resulting rates may benefit from focused regulatory audits that would allow the PUC to identify the amount of costs that should be deemed unreasonable. The PUC's decision on this matter is still pending . 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 24 - Maui Electric Company, Limited's (\"MECO\") 2012 Test Year Rate Case On July 22, 2011, MECO filed an application for approval to increase its rates (by approximately $23,500,000 or 6.7%, over revenues at current effective rates) and to amend its rules . The DCA, among other things, participated in public hearings on each of the islands in MECO's service territory (Maui, Lanai, and Molokai), conducted inspections of company facilities and witness interviews, and has initiated an extensive discovery proc ess. The DCA continues to examine the support for any increase in rates as well as other issues in the case, such as implementation of decoupling for MECO. Young Brothers , Limited's (\"YB\") Application for Rate Increase On December 23, 2010, YB filed an application for a general rate increase. DCA filed a S tatement of Position (\"SOP\") indicating that the application was not complete, because it did not include YBs' actual results of operation for the previous calendar year. The PUC ordered YB to file a completed application no later than June 30, 2011. On May 6, 2011, YB re -filed its application for a rate increase with a 2011 test year. The re -filed application requested a 28.8% rate increase in the amount of $16,986,000. This revenue requirement re flected the alleged negative impact that Pasha Hawaii Transport Lines LLC would have on YBs' roll on/roll off cargo volumes. (Pasha began a limited inter -island roll on/roll off service in February, 2011, pursuant to a PUC interim Decision & Order that ga ve Pasha a three- year certificate of public convenience & necessity.) YB argued in its application that it would lose significant revenue as a result of this competition into the inter -island shipping market. In the alternative, YB requested a revenue in crease of $13,591,000 or a 22.50% revenue increase without the \"Pasha impact.\" DCA filed numerous Information Requests (\"IRs\") ; conducted interviews of YBs' financial employees; toured all of YBs' facilities; retained consultants to analyze YBs' application; and participated in public hearings on all islands served by YB. The two most significant positions taken b y DCA in this docket were that 1) YB should not get any increase for the alleged \"Pasha impact\" and 2) YB was not entitled to include an imput ed corporate income tax allowance in its cost of service because YB and its corporate parent Saltchuk Resources, Inc. are both Subchapter S corporations and neither pay corporate income taxes. DCA refused to negotiate on either of these two items. An evi dentiary hearing was held on November 1, 2011, on the phantom income tax issue. All other issues were settled, including the \"Pasha impact\" that YB agreed to withdraw from consideration by the PUC. The parties then briefed the income tax issue on Novembe r 16, 2011. DCA argued that Hawaii's consumers should not be required to pay the personal income taxes of Saltchuk's shareholders, which would be the result if YB was allowed to include a phantom income tax e xpense in its cost of service. Hawaii -American Water Company (\"HAWC\") 2011 Test Year Rate Case On February 22, 2011, HAWC filed an application for approval to increase its rates (by approximately $1,764,860 or approximately a 21% increase over revenue at its prior existing rates). The DCA participat ed in a public hearing, conducted its review and analysis, developed testimonies, engaged in a negotiation process with HAWC to resolve the outstanding issues of this proceeding, and answered numerous information requests of the PUC. On November 21, 2011, the PUC issued its Decision and Order approving the Parties' Stipulation of Settlement Agreement in Lieu of Rebuttal Testimonies, an Evidentiary Hearing and post -hearing briefs, which specifically approved an increase in revenues over 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 25 - present rates of $1,246,630 or approximately 14.20% for HAWC based upon a total revenue requirement of $10,026,020 for the 2011 calendar test year. Thus, the DCA was able to provide ratepayers a cost -savings of over $500,000. Hawaii Water Service Company (\"HWSC\") General Rate Case for its Kaanapali Division On December 30, 2010, HWSC filed an application for approval to increase its rates (by approximately $1,546,250 or 54.6%, over revenues at current effective rates) and to amend its rules. The DCA, among other things, participated in the public hearing, conducted discovery, inspections and witness interviews, and filed i ts testimonies and exhibits that recommended various adjustments to HWSC's requested increases. The DCA contended that any increase in utility rates a bove 25% might constitute rate shock, which generally refers to a sudden and significant increase in rates that will be difficult for the affected customers to absorb, and recommended an increase of only 18%. If the requested increase exceed ed 25%, DCA recommends that a rate phase in plan be considered where the overall increase is phased in over at least two different points , with the first increase effective with the PUC 's interim increase and the subsequent increases occurring after an interval that wou ld allow residents and businesses to properly plan for that next incremental increase. In November 2011, t he PUC approved requests by the parties to amend the procedural schedules. As the only two parties to the docket, HWSC and DCA are still attempting to reach a stipulated settlement in lieu of proceeding to an evidentiary hearing. The PUC approved an amended procedural schedule for the parties to resolve outstanding issues by December 12, 2011. The DCA will remain flexible and continue to work with HW SC to ne gotiate and settle proceedings. The PUC's decision and order is pending in this case. Olowalu Water Company, Inc. (\"Olowalu\") 2011 Test Year Rate Cas e On December 29, 2010, Olowalu filed an application requesting an increase in both potable and non-potable water utility service revenues of 77%, amounting to additional revenues of $60,570. This was Olowalu's first rate increase request since receiving its authority to operate as a public utility in August 2000. The DCA filed its SOP on May 7, 2011 with a recommended 28% increase for additional revenues of $27,294. On July 1, 2011, the parties entered into a settlement agreement for an increase of 47%, resulting in additional revenues of $43,146. The parties agreed to an across -the-board increase of 44% being phased in over two periods, with the first increase at 25% and the second at 19%. On August 17, 2011, the PUC issued its Decision and Order accepting the parties' settlement agreement. Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. - Pukalani Wastewater District (\"Pukalani\") 2012 Test Year Rate Case On August 12, 2011, Pukalani filed its application seeking a 224.7% revenue increase equal to $1,325,924 over current revenues for wastewater service provided to residential and commercial customers in Pukal ani, Maui. Pukalani is seeking cost recovery for the replacement of the wastewater treatment plant and higher operating expenses. The DCA participated in the public hearing and completed its discovery phase. The DCA's testimony and exhibits will be file d in December 2011. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 26 - Molokai Public Utilities, Inc.'s (\"MPUI\") and Waiola O Molokai, Inc.'s (\"WOMI\") Rate Cases On June 16, 2008, the PUC issued an order opening a proceeding to provide temporary rate relief to two related water utilities, MPUI and WOMI. The PUC was responding to an announcement in late March 2008 by Molokai Properties, Limited, of its intention to cease all current water service operations on Molokai. During the fiscal year, the DCA participated in public hearings and meetings, intervi ewed customers, conducted analysis of the limited financial information available from the companies, and provided the PUC with a SOP reluctantly stating non -opposition of the significant rate increases. On August 14, 2008, the PUC approved rate increases for the companies, effective on September 1, 2008. The PUC 's Decision and Order required MPUI and WOMI to file rate increase applications within six months of the date of the Decision and Order if a third party was not found to take over the utilities. On March 2, 2009, MPUI and WOMI filed rate increase applications with the PUC , requesting revenue increases of $562,550 and $308,781 over revenues at present rates for MPUI and WOMI, respectively. The DCA objected via statements regarding completeness of applications to MPUI's and WOMI's requests to waive the requirement to file audited financial statements in compliance with the PUC's rules. On April 2, 2009, the PUC denied MPUI's and WOMI's requests to file unaudited financial statements, requiring the companies to obtain independently audited financial statements and to file amended applications reflecting such audited financials. On June 29, 2009, MPUI and WOMI filed amended applications for rate increase with the PUC, seeking net revenue increases of $886,259 and $473,431 for MPUI and WOMI, respectively, using the pro forma revenue amounts at present rates for the 2009- 2010 test year. Based on the temporary rates authorized in the Temporary Rate Order, MPUI's proposed net revenue increase amounts t o $565,939, which is an approximate 74.6% increase from the pro forma revenue amount of $758,958 at the temporary rate for the 2009- 2010 test year. Based on the temporary rates authorized in the Temporary Rate Order, WOMI's proposed net revenue increase amounts to $308,431, which is an approximate 106.96% increase from the pro forma revenue amount of $288,360 at the temporary rate for the 2009- 2010 test year. The DCA participated in the public hearings , and due to the presence of intervenors in both docke ted proceedings, the proceedings were contentious. The DCA participated in a lengthy discovery process and submitted written testimonies. Due to concurrent civil litigation between the County of Maui and Molokai Properties, Ltd., there was a mediation pr ocess that was ongoing and the parties involved in the proceedings before the PUC were asked to participate in the mediation process, to which the DCA complied. While an agreement was reached between MPUI, WOMI and the DCA, the intervenors, County of Maui and West Molokai Association, did not enter into any settlement agreements. As there was no agreement among all of the parties, the PUC held evidentiary hearings in both dockets. The PUC filed its Interim Decision and Orders in the MPUI and WOMI cases on May 28, 2010, which adopted most of the settlement agreement between MPUI, WOMI and the DCA. This authorized MPUI to increase its rates on an interim basis by $542,724, or an approximate increase of 125.2%. WOMI's authorized increase was $241,478, or a n approximate increase of 222.8%. The PUC filed its Final Decision and Order in the MPUI case on September 23, 2010, which allowed the $548,682 increase that was agreed to in settlement. The final decision in the WOMI case was filed on February 8, 2011, which allowed a $360,238 increase or an approximate 284% increase. The PUC acknowledged the significant increase but noted that it was necessary as the utility had not requested a rate 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 27 - increase for over seventeen (17) years. The PUC approved the settleme nt proposal between the DCA and WOMI to implement a three- step phase -in to allow ratepayers an opportunity to absorb the consequences of the rate increase o ver a period of twelve months. The County of Maui has appealed both the PUC 's final Decision and Or ders in both the MPUI and WOMI dockets. The DCA has filed Appellee responsive brief in both appellate proceedings. Both appellate decisions are still pending before the Hawaii Intermediate Court of Appeals. Generic and Other Proceedings Feed -in Tari ff Investigative Proceeding On October 24, 2008, the PUC initiated an investigation into the implementation of feed -in tariffs (\"FIT\") for the service territories of H ECO, Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. (\"HELCO\") and MECO (collectively, the \"HECO Co mpanies'\"). On September 25, 2009, the PUC issued a Decision and Order establishing several policy principles that would guide the development and implementation of a FIT program for the HECO Companies' service territories. Throughout 2011, the DCA parti cipated in numerous formal and informal meetings dedicated to the further development, implementation, and/or refinement of the FIT program for the HECO Companies' service territories. On June 3, 2011, the PUC issued a procedural order discussing the need to further refine and/or develop Tier 3 of the HECO Companies' FIT program. Following a series of filings made by the PUC -approved Independent Observer, on October 4, 2011, the DCA provided its comments with respect to Tier 3 of the HECO Companies' FIT program. In the view of the DCA, Tier 3 of the HECO Companies' FIT program should be implemented without modifications. As of the end of November 2011, the PUC has yet to rule upon Tier 3 of the HECO Companies' FIT program. Decoupling Investigative Proceeding On October 24, 2008, the PUC initiated a proceeding to investigate the implementation of a decoupling mechanism for the HECO Companies, pursuant to the recommendation of the signatories to the Energy Agreement. Generally, decoupling is a regulat ory tool designed to separate a utility's revenue from changes in energy sales. The prospect of decoupling was one of the items that were enumerated in the Energy Agreement signed on October 20, 2008 by parties including the Governor Lingle, the HECO Companies, and the DCA. The DCA engaged in a lengthy process of evaluating and analyzing various decoupling proposals and developed a proposal consistent with the Energy Agreement but with modifications meant to help protect consumers' interests to which the HECO Companies agreed. The PUC filed its final decision and order on August 31, 2010 that implemented the joint proposal that was filed. The actual implementation of decoupling was contingent on the PUC being able to approve electric rates that reflect a return on equity that has been adjusted for decoupling. The PUC has had filed its decision and order for HECO in Docket No. 2008 -0083 and the first decoupling filing occurred in 2011. Since that time, the DCA has been working with the PUC and the HECO C ompanies to further refine and improve the filing process in anticipation of HECO's next filing in 2012 as well as the possibility of additional decoupling filings by MECO and HELCO. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 28 - AT&T And T -Mobile U SA Merger On April 21, 2011, AT&T filed an applicat ion for either the PUC 's waiver to consider AT&T 's Stock Acquisition of T -Mobile or in the alternative, approval of such transaction. On August 24, 2011, the DCA filed its SOP representing that it had concerns regarding the overall impact on the market s hare of telecommunication service in the State of Hawaii relating to this transaction but also stated that such consideration is at issue at the national corporate level and better left to the Federal Communication Commission and the United States Departme nt of Justice's (\"DOJ\") investigation and disposition. On August 31, 2011, the DOJ filed its complaint in the District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to enjoin the transaction. Pursuant to a Stipulated Scheduling and Case -Management Order is sued on September 23, 2011, U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle set February 13, 2012, as the date to begin trial which is estimated to take four to six weeks to complete. On November 10, 2011, the PUC filed its Order suspending this docket pending the disposition of the DOJ complaint. Biodiesel Supply Contract with Aina Koa Pono- Ka'u L LC HELCO filed its application on January 6, 2011, for the PUC 's approval for a fuel purchase contract with Aina Koa Pono- Ka'u LLC (\"AKP\") for 16 million gallons per year of locally produced biofuel over twenty years. The application also requested the establishment of a Biofuel Surcharge Provision that will pass through the differential between the cost of the biofuel and the cost of the petroleum fuel that the biofuel is replacing, in the event the cost of the biofuel is higher than the cost of the petroleum fuel, for the customers of HECO, HELCO, and MECO based on the customers ' kilowatt -hour (\"kWh\") usage. AKP is a Hawaii -based limited liability company, formed to develop renewable energy solutions which are sustainable, reliable, and environmentally sound, with an emphasis on actively generating local economic development opportunities in the State. AKP sought to build and operate a bio- refinery project in the Ka 'u District of the Island of Hawaii (\"Facility\") in order to produce, among other products, biodiesel to meet AKP's delivery obligations under the Biodiesel Supply Contract dated January 6, 2011. Initially, the PUC issued an order that if AKP's biodiesel was to be purchased by HELCO only, then the surcharge could not be spread across all HECO Companies ' ratepayers. However, as a result of the passage of Act 69, SLH 2011, the Legislature authorized a surcharge for companies that aggregate their respective Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) requirements to allocate costs associated with meeting the RPS where reasonable. HECO subsequently withdrew its request to include MECO in the surcharge, but still included HELCO and HECO. The DCA, in its SOP concernin g HECO's application for approval of the AKP contract, noted strong consumer opposition due to environmental, cultural and cost concerns but ultimately supported the application. As part of its consideration, the Consumer Advocate took note of the State A dministration's support for the concept of the project that serves a number of principles that are set forth in the \"New Day Plan,\" in particular the need to reduce Hawaii' s dependence on petroleum oil. The DCA further noted the benefit of the fixed- priced for AKP's contract over the 20- year period. Although higher than the price of petroleum diesel, the fixed AKP contract price would mitigate against the 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 29 - price volatility of petroleum. The Consumer Advocate also found that the AKP contract price was consistent with other biofuel contracts that had been previously approved by the PUC . The DCA then recommended that the PUC approve the HECO/AKP biodiesel contract with the suggestion that HELCO should also be excluded from the surcharge. On September 29, 2011, the PUC filed its Decision and Order denying the application, noting that the commitment to purchase 16 million gallons per year of AKP produced biofuel at the proposed price was too high in comparison to known petroleum fuel costs. The PUC compared t he biodiesel contract price against the Annual Energy Outlook (published by the United States Department of Energy) reference forecasts for the price of oil in determining that AKP's price was too high. Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standards On March 8, 2010, the PUC initiated an investigation into the establishment and implementation of energy efficiency portfolio standards (\"EEPS\") for the State of Hawaii (\"State\") pursuant to Act 155, Session Laws of Hawaii 2009, and Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a7 269- 96. T he PUC 's investigation into the establishment and implementation of an EEPS for the State arises out of the Energy Agreement entered into by the State, the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism, the DCA, and the HECO Companies on Octobe r 20, 2008. Following numerous technical meetings and exchanges of information attended by or conducted on behalf of the parties participating in the PUC 's EEPS Docket, on August 29, 2011, the parties to the PUC 's EEPS Docket, including the DCA, filed Sta tements of Position outlining the parties' respective positions on the Framework for Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standards proposed by the PUC on August 5, 2011. As of the end of November 2011, the PUC has yet to issue a decision and order pertaining to t he establishment and implementation of an EEPS for the State. Reliability Standards Working Group (\"RSWG\") In August 2010, the PUC filed an order approving, with modifications, the HECO Companies' proposal for a Reliability Standards Working Group to ass ist in facilitating the continued movement toward a clean energy future and ensure reliability throughout the HECO Companies' service territories. The DCA, as a member of the RSWG , has participated , and will continue to participate , in workshops and webin ars to address reliability issues to facilitate the interconnection of renewable energy resources to meet the State's sustainability and renewa ble energy goals. On September 8, 2011, the PUC initiated an investigation into the implementation of reliabilit y standards for the service territories of H ECO, HELCO, and MECO, the HECO Companies . The PUC initially approved of the development of reliability standards in the PUC 's on -going investigation into the establishment of FIT for the service territories of t he HECO Companies. (See the PUC 's Decision and Order filed on September 25, 2009 in PUC Docket No. 2008- 0273, the PUC 's investigation into establishing a FIT program for the HECO Companies' service territories; see also the DCA's participation in Docket No. 2008- 0273 in the summer of 2011). Throughout the fall of 2011, the DCA, through its designated representative, has been participating in numerous meetings dedicated to the identification of the scope, duties, and responsibilities of the PUC -approved R SWG. As of the end of November 2011, work on and for the RSWG is still on -going. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 30 - Kapolei Substation On February 3, 2011, HECO filed an application seeking PUC approval to commit funds estimated at approximately $9.85 million, excluding customer contribut ions, for the purchase, construction and installation of the Kapolei Substation, Kapolei Transformers #1 and #2, and associated 46kV and 12kV circuits, related equipment, and easements. The DCA, among other things, participated in the public hearing, conducted a rigorous review, submitted information requests and filed a SOP to address concerns raised by State Senator Gabbard, State Representative Har, the Villages of Kapolei Association, and several area residents. Recovery of Deferred Costs for Big Wind Implementation Studies through the Renewable Energy Infrastructure Program Surcharge On May 17, 2011, HECO filed an application respectfully requesting P UC approval to recover approximately $3,912,952 for Stage 1 Big Wind Implementation Studies costs thr ough the Renewable Energy Infrastructure Program (\"REIP\") Surcharge approved by the PUC in Docket No. 2007- 0416, the PUC 's investigation into the establishment and implementation of a REIP for HECO, H ELCO and MECO . Previously, HECO requested, and the PUC approved, the deferral of Stage 1 Big Wind Implementation Studies costs in Docket No. 2009- 0162. On October 7, 2011, the DCA submitted IRs to HECO seeking further support, clarification, and/or information with respect to certain matters presented by HECO in its application filed on May 17, 2011. On October 28, 2011, HECO responded to the IRs issued by the DCA in the Big Wind Implementation Studies Cost Recovery Docket. In December 2011, the DCA filed a SOP (\"SOP\") detailing its position regarding the req uest to recover Big Wind Implementation Studies costs through HECO's REIP Surcharge. As of December 2011, the PUC has yet to issue a decision and order pertaining to HECO's request to recover Big Wind Implementation Studies costs through HECO's REIP Surch arge. Big Wind Assignment of Non- Conforming Bid to Molokai Renewables Pursuant to a previous PUC Decision & Order, Castle & Cooke had been granted a non- conforming bid to develop 400 MW of wind- generated electricity that would be delivered to Oahu via an undersea transmission cable. Hawaii Holding, LLC dba First Wind Hawaii was granted a similar non -conforming bid for a wind farm on Molokai . HECO was given until March 31, 2011 to submit term sheets for contracts on the non- conforming bids. First Wind w as not able to secure the necessary property rights from Molokai Ranch; therefore, HECO was not able to submit a term sheet for a Molokai project. HECO requested that Castle & Cooke be allowed to assign 200 MW of its Lanai project to a new wind farm devel oper, Molokai Renewables ( a joint venture between Molokai Ranch and Pattern Energy). DCA submitted a letter indicating that it did not agree that Castle & Cooke had a legally assignable right that it could assign to Molokai Renewables. On the other hand, in order to keep the Molokai wind farm project viable, DCA recommended that the PUC accept Molokai Renewable's proposal. The PUC agreed with DCA that Castle & Cooke did not have a legally assignable right, but disagreed with DCA that it should accept Mol okai Renewable's proposal. The PUC then opened a new docket for RFPs for 200 MW of renewable energy to be delivered to Oahu. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 31 - Kauai Island Utility Cooperative ( \"KIUC \") Financing On June 1, 2011, KIUC requested approval to obtain $42 million in financing and security arrangements from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Utilities Service for planned capital improvements. After reviewing the financial documentation and budgeted capital improvements, the DCA supported KIUC's financing request. The PUC issued its Decision and Order on August 25, 2011 approving KIUC's request. MECO's Application for Approval of Power Purchase Agreement with Auwahi Wind Energy LLC, and Determination that the Maui Electric -Owned Interconnection Facilities be Constructed A bove the Surface of the Ground Pursuant to HRS 269- 27.6(a) On March 17, 2011, MECO filed an application for PUC approval of a purchase power agreement (\"PPA\") with Auwahi Wind Energy LLC (\"AWE\"), in which AWE would furnish, install, operate and maintain a n approximately 21 MW wind farm facility on 'Ulupalakua Ranch, in the Hana, Kula and Kihei districts on the Island of Maui. After reviewing the Company's responses to the IRs, the DCA filed its SOP on June 8, 2011, stating that it did not object to the PU C's approval of the Company's application. On June 15, 2011, the PUC issued its final Decision and Order, approving the instant application. However, the PUC stated in its Decision and Order that any requests for recovering MECO -caused cost overruns related to the MECO -owned Interconnection Facilities will be subject to review in MECO's next rate proceeding or equivalent cost -recovery mechanism (e.g., decoupling) following the completion of the MECO -owned Interconnection Facilities. Also, due to the PUC 's concerns about lingering uncertainties in the PPA (i.e.: 1) the type, number and location of the turbines; 2) the type and configuration of the battery energy storage system; 3) progress of the permit process; 4) progress of interconnection costs; and 5) documentation of existing or, if necessary, establishment of acceptable post -project site restoration requirements; and 6) progress of project completion), it required MECO to file quarterly progress reports until the project's completion. The Gas Company, Inc.'s (\"TGC\") Feedstock Alternative to Producing Synthetic Natural Gas On December 22, 2010, TG C filed an application for approval to 1) expend in excess of $2,347,367 to design, implement and install its Bio Synthesis Gas Pilot Project to test the f easibility of producing synthetic natural gas (\"SNG\") from feedstock derived from canola oil or other virgin animal fats and oils (collectively, \"Triglycerides\"); and 2) include the project's fuel cost in its fuel adjustment calculation. On March 3, 2011, the PUC issued an order denying intervention by Life of the Land. During the year, the DCA issued numerous IRs seeking further support and clarification from TGC . DCA acknowledges TGC's efforts to support the State's objectives of sustainability and rec ognizes that TGC is proposing a pilot program to further investigate the use of bio- feedstock. The PUC also issued IRs to TGC seeking additional information. The PUC has not yet filed a decision and order in this case. Pa Makani dba Sandwich Isles Wirele ss's Application for D esignation as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier On June 3, 2011, Pa Makani dba Sandwich Isles Wireless (\"Sandwich Isles Wireless\") filed an application for a certificate of registration (\"COR\") in Docket No. 2011 -0131. On June 27, 2011, while 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 32 - Docket No. 2011- 0131 was still pending, Sandwich Isles Wireless filed an application with the PUC for designation as an eligible telecommunications carrier (\"ETC\"). Soon after, Coral Wireless, LLC dba Mobi PCS (\"Mobi\") filed a letter with the PUC raising the following issue : \"Is the PUC required to dismiss without prejudice the application in HPUC Docket No. 2011- 0145 due to fact that at the time of filing such application Sandwich Isles Wireless was not a Hawaii certificated public utilit y holding the requisite Certificate of Registration (COR)? \" Sandwich Isles Wireless responded to Mobi's letter. Also on that day, Mobi filed with the PUC a Motion to Intervene as a Party to the Proceeding. On August 25, 2011, the PUC filed an order gran ting: 1 ) the Motion to Strike Coral Wireless, LLC's Memorandum in Response to Pa Makani's Statement of Opposition filed on August 12, 2011, by Pa Makani, LLC dba Sandwich Isles Wireless; and 2) the Motion of Coral Wireless, LLC to Intervene as a Party to t he Proceeding filed on July 18, 2011, by Mobi . The DCA submitted its IRs to Sandwich Isles Wireless and subsequently received the Company's responses. The DCA filed its SOP on September 30, 2011, stating that it did not object to the PUC's approval of Sa ndwich Isles Wireless' designation as an ETC. On November 10, 2011, Mobi filed a Motion for Summary Judgment recommending that the PUC dismiss Sandwich Isles Wireless' application because: 1) the FCC's rules do not permit wireless resellers to receive un iversal service support [ 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.201(1) ]; and 2) Sandwich Isles Wireless leased spectrum without first notifying and receiving approval from the FCC. The final decision and order in this proceeding is pending. Advocacy through Participation on Co mmittees and Boards Enhanced Wireless 911 Services The DCA has been an active participant in the State's implementation of an order issued by the FCC mandating that enhanced 911 (\"E -911\") services be provided by wireless telecommunication carriers. The passage of Act 159 (SLH 2004) provided the framework to implement the State's wireless E -911 system to route emergency calls to emergency responders along with the wireless callers' identification and location. Act 159 (SLH 2004) also established a Wir eless Enhanced 911 Board that oversees the collection and distribution of money collected by the E -911 special fund designates the Executive Director of the DCA as a member of the board . The DCA through its Executive Director has continued to be an active participant in the implementation of this system which is critical to the public safety of both Hawaii residents and visitors. One Call Center Advisory Committee The Executive Director of the DCA is also a member of the One Call Center Advisory Committee, which makes recommendations to the PUC regarding the implementation of Chapter 269E, Hawaii Revised Statutes (Act 141, SLH 2004). This advisory committee was integral in developing the request for proposals for a vendor to operate a \"call -before -you-dig\" system. The system, which was operational on January 1, 2006, will reduce the risk of critical services being disrupted because utility systems were inadvertently damaged due to excavation work conducted in areas where the systems are placed in under ground facilities. This will ensure greater public health and safety, and ultimately save excavators time and money. Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative (\"Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative\") 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 33 - On January 31, 2008, the State of Hawaii and the United States Depa rtment of Energy (\"U.S. DOE\") launched the HCEI, an agreement, which among other things, established for the State a goal of 70% clean energy resource use by 2030. The State and the U.S. DOE formed various committees designed to examine differing aspects of the State's energy use - transportation, electricity, energy efficiency, etc. The DCA is participating in the HCEI's Integration Committee, which, with the aid of U.S. DOE experts, seeks to consolidate the themes and suggestions put forth by the remaining committees. As part of HCEI, the Executive Director of DCA also participates in the Steering Committee, which deals with the high level planning associated with various aspects of the technical committees that are analyzing various areas (electricity , end- use efficiency, transportation, fuels, and outreach) that are expected to be integral to the success of HCEI. The DCA also participates in the Technical Advisory Group (\"TAG\") that is responsible for evaluating the energy efficiency process that has been transitioned from the HECO Companies to a third-party administrator. As part of this process, the TAG currently meets on a quarterly basis and evaluates various aspects of the measures being implemented to help plan, evaluate, and implement energy efficient programs in the service territories of the HECO Companies. Using the monies collected through the Public Benefits Fund surcharge, the TAG evaluates the use of the monies to help Hawaii's efforts to reduce its over-reliance on imported fossil fue ls. Education and Outreach During the past year the DCA has continued to focus on expanding its education and outreach activities. This has allowed the DCA to increase its ability to educate consumers and extend its reach into communities throughout t he State. The DCA continued distributing its newsletter at public fairs and festivals throughout the State, and has vastly increased its electronic distribution list during the 2010 - 2011 fiscal year. DCA targets those events most likely to produce consumers interested in utility and conservation matters, increasing the overall number of consumers reached. The DCA also used other communications tools such as press releases, its web site, and other in -house produced publications to reach the public. These tools were used to highlight various utility issues and to encourage greater participation in PUC public hearings, energy conservation and efficiency efforts, and to help consumers make wise choices when purchasing telecommunications services. Intera ctive Participation with Other State Agencies Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism 's (\"DBEDT\") Hawaii's Electric Vehicle ( \"EV\") Rebate Program Hawaii residents and businesses may qualify for rebates of up to $5,000 when purchasing and installing qualified electric vehicles and charging equipment. In May 2010, the DBEDT and the DCCA signed a Memorandum of Agreement (\"MOA\"), which outlined DCCA's role in implementing DBEDT's EV Rebate Program. In October 2010, the DCA's Education Speci alist was assigned as the Electric Vehicle Rebate Project Administrator. The administrator handles all public inquiries, rebate applications, mailing of rebate checks, record keeping, and reporting to DBEDT. On average, from October 2010 through October 2011, DCA used a little under 12.5 work hours per month related to the rebate program. It 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Consumer Advocacy (DCA) - 34 - should be noted; however, the workload started slow, but picked up dramatically starting in the second quarter of 2011 once electric vehicles became available in Haw aii. A more accurate representative monthly average runs closer to 20 hours per month. The time spent by DCA's Education Specialist to work on the EV Rebate Program took away from his duties within the division (and DCCA), and therefore was billed to DBE DT. While originally slated to conclude in September 30, 2011, DBEDT extended the rebate program to run through January 31, 2012. Note that this date reflects the deadline for the public to submit an application. The processing and administering of the program and wrapping up the program with DBEDT will likely carry on for several weeks after January 31, 2012. In addition, the funding for the rebate program later increased to $1,666,837 and DCCA Director, Keali`i Lopez, signed an amendment to the MOA on November 8, 2011. To date (as of November 18, 2011), DCCA processed 404 rebates, totaling $1,144,006. Document Management System The DCA, in partnership with the PUC, developed a new docket and document management system to improve internal efficienc ies and to make documents filed with the PUC available to the public in electronic format. This new system may be found at: http://dms.puc.hawaii.gov/dms/ . Financial Summary The CRF financial summary relating to DCA for FY 10- 11 is as follows: Perso nnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $926,980 $748,549 $1,675,529 $2,414,736 CONCLUSION The DCA will continue to prioritize its caseload to target projects and consumer issues that have the greatest impact on the ratepayer s of utility and transportation services in Hawaii. In addition, the DCA is expanding its education and outreach efforts. Together, this places the DCA in a better position to take a more proactive approach to address specific consumer issues and to gain greater public participation in decisions that affect their public utility and transportation services. 2011 Co mpliance Resolution Fund Report - 35 - DIVISION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (DFI) website: www.hawaii.gov/dcca/dfi e-mail address for gener al matters: address for mortgage loan originator program: dfi -nmls@dcca.hawaii.gov OVERVIEW The Division of Financial Institutions' (DFI) Mission: E nsure the safety and soundness of state-chartered and state- licensed financial institutions, and regulatory compliance by state -licensed financial institutions, escrow depositories, money transmitters, mortgage servicers, mortgage loan originators and mortgage loan originator companies, by fai rly administering applicable statutes and rules in order to protect the rights and funds of depositors, borrowers, consumers and other members of the community. DFI is charged with the supervision and regulation of all Hawaii State -chartered and State -licensed financial institutions, including banks, foreign banking agencies and representative offices, savings and loan associations, trust companies, and financial services loan companies (both depository and non-depository), and credit unions. DFI also li censes and regulates escrow depositories, money transmitters, mortgage servicers, mortgage loan originators and mortgage loan originator companies. In supervising financial institutions authorized to take deposits, DFI works closely with the Federal Depos it Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and the National Credit Union Administration. DFI was first accredited by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) in 1990 and re - accredited in 1995, 2000, and 2005. The CSBS accreditation program sets high standards for state banking regulators nationwide. DFI's status as a fully accredited agency is currently under review by CSBS and plans to undergo an on- site reaccreditation review in 2012. DFI is located at 335 Mer chant Street, Room 221, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. The public may call DFI at (808) 586 -2820 or send e -mail to dfi@dcca.hawaii.gov or dfi-nmls@dcca.hawaii.gov (mortg age loan originators and mortgage loan originator companies . Composition DFI is lead by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, assisted by an Administrative Section consisting of the Deputy Commissioner, a specialist, a regulation analyst, and a s ecretarial staff supervised by the Secretary of the Division. This section coordinates and facilitates activities within DFI, with other divisions, and with other state and federal agencies regarding regulatory and supervisory issues. Within DFI, there are two branches: (1) the Field Examination Branch and (2) the Licensing and Regulatory Analysis Branch, each composed of financial institution examiners and supervised by its own Branch Manager. The Field Examination Branch is responsible for the on- site examination of financial institutions. Examinations, unlike accounting audits, are forward- looking reviews of factors underlying the safety and soundness of the financial institutions. For example, examiners not only evaluate existing and projected fina ncial information, but also assess the effectiveness of management, its policies, and implementation of those policies in administering the institution's risk management programs and practices. The Field Examination Branch also conducts examinations and i nvestigations of escrow 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Financial Institutions (DFI) - 36 - depositories, money transmitters, mortgage loan originators and mortgage loan originator companies when warranted. The Licensing and Regulatory Analysis Branch is responsible for licensing activities and other regulatory approvals, the off -site monitoring program, responding to complaints and inquiries, and investigating alleged violations of state law. The Licensing and Regulatory Analysis Branch Manager also assists the Deputy Commissioner in administrative matters such as legislation, training, and budgetary items. GOALS and OBJECTIVES Division Goals . DFI's goals center on the orientation, training, and effective deployment of its Examiners. Federal programs administered by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve are regularly used for this purpose as are web -based programs provided by CSBS, the Risk Management Association, and the Hawaii Financial Regulatory Compliance Association. On- the-job training is also a valuable component of the training plan. DFI's goals also focus on the recruitment of new staff that will be able to comprehend and adjust to an ever changing financial services industry. New financial service products (e.g., reverse mortgages, negative equity automobile loans, etc.), delivery channels (e.g., gift cards), providers (e.g., Wal - Mart), economic conditions (e.g., the \"global credit crisis\"), regulatory changes (e.g., the Dodd- Frank Act), additional federal regulatory agencies, and the attendant opportunities and risks associated with these developments, create a radically expanded regulatory environment in which the use of new experiences and skills (in addition to those currently required) will be necessary to successfully accomplish DFI's mission. Objectives and Policies . As a part of the CSBS accreditation p rocess, DFI is required to establish a strategic plan and develop policies and operating guidelines to achieve plan objectives. DFI's strategic plan calls for it to: Recognize the Continuing Need for Dramatic Change Broaden Its Focus Expand Skill Sets Identify the Client Become Totally Client Centric Improve the Speed of the Organization DFI's objectives are defined by its strategic plan and the policies to accomplish those objectives are imbedded within the policy and operating manuals. Action P lan . DFI's action plan is built around its strategic plan. The timetable calls for realization of short term training related goals in a one to two year time frame with longer range goals relating to experience and recruitment in a five year time frame. Performance Measurement . DFI currently measures performance in two ways. The first is empirical - that is, absolute measurements based on the fiscal health and regulatory compliance of the State's DFI -regulated institutions using both regular financial and examination based measurements. The 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Financial Institutions (DFI) - 37 - second is the measurement of DFI's internal throughput - that is, how many complaints have been answered, how many applications processed, etc. The first measurement is critical, especially in the current climate of global turmoil in the financial services industry, and demonstrates performance in DFI's key area of responsibility - to ensure the safety and soundness of Hawaii -chartered financial institutions. The second measurement, while informative, is less usef ul, and in many ways does not accurately reflect either effort or results as it does not measure the complexity and changing nature of the work. It continues to be under review for possible modification or replacement. ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Banking Indust ry in Hawaii. The national mortgage crisis that began in 2007, evolved into a full-scale financial crisis in 2008 that continued into 2011. Unprecedented economic disruptions both nationally and globally resulted in the failure, government take -over, gov ernment -assisted acquisition, or government assistance of some of the world's largest financial companies ranging from the government - sponsored enterprises such as Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation; AIG, the n ation's largest insurance company; investment banks such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers; to a large number of depository institutions including IndyMac Bank and Washington Mutual. Despite sweeping federal legislation and regulatory actions to restore liquidity and stability to the U.S. financial system, the number of bank failures in the U.S. in 2010 was at its highest level since 1992. Although the number of bank failures in the U.S. has decreased in 2011, problems in the banking industry continued through 2011 as the financial crisis in Europe continued to threaten the global financial system. While Hawaii -chartered financial institutions were not immediately impacted by the national financial market disruptions, the increasing rate of residential mortgage loan foreclosures, disappointing business conditions sparked by precipitous declines in visitor arrivals, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and falls in stock and other monetary asset values resulted in deteriorating balance sheets at a number of these institutions. In 2011, DFI continued to monitor the impact of the disruptions and of numerous federal initiatives on the overall industry and on individual Hawaii institutions, and actively worked with the se institutions and the federal banking r egulators to proactively address emerging issues. Heightened supervisory oversight will continue through 2012 as additional laws and regulations are finalized in response to the financial crisis faced locally, nationally and globally. Implementation of New Federal Laws Continues to Expand and Impact DFI's Regulatory Role. The Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd- Frank Act\") was enacted in 2010 in response to the global financial crisis and is considered the most sweeping chan ge to financial regulation in the United States since the Great Depression. It affects almost every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including consumer protection; systemic risks; large, complex institutions; liquidation procedures for syst emically significant financial companies; executive compensation and corporate governance; mortgage practices; proprietary trading; hedge funds; credit rating agencies; and the structure and powers of the federal financial regulatory agencies. It has been estimated that the Dodd - Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt over 200 rules. In addition, a major overhaul of the global capital standards, Basel III, is being proposed by the international financial regulators to strengthen capital requi rements and address the risk of systemically significant institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that was established by the Dodd- Frank Act, began operations on July 21, 2011. DFI expects that it will be coordinating examinations an d supervisory activities with the CFPB for the large depository state -chartered financial institutions and for nondepositor y financial service providers in Hawaii. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Financial Institutions (DFI) - 38 - DFI manages its programs and trains its staff to ensure compliance with statutes such as the Dodd- Frank Act as along with federal laws relating to money laundering, privacy for consumer financial information, and corporate governance. DFI must monitor the implementation of all federal statutes and the numerous new rules related to those statut es as well as any changes to the Basel capital standards to determine what the impacts are on the institutions DFI regulates and supervises. DFI then develops the necessary procedures and trains its staff to effectively ensure compliance and the safety an d soundness of the institutions DFI regulates. The new laws, rules and regulations, the evolution of the industry, radical shifts in economic conditions and the continuous impact of key drivers such as corporate governance concerns, advances in financial service products, delivery channels, providers, and the attendant opportunities and risks associated with these developments, mandate that DFI's regulatory and supervisory roles must constantly adapt to meet the new regulatory challenges associated with th e changing conditions. After the 2011 legislative session concluded, the Commissioner, along with other members of the Department, embarked on a public education speaking tour. The Commissioner discussed the new provisions that were enacted with affected licensees, trade associations , industry associations, and attorneys who have client/licensees. The educational sessions were provided to share information and receive comments from the different groups in order to clarify how the new laws affected the i ndustry. Supervision of the Money Transmitter Industry in Hawaii . As noted in previous reports, with the passage of Act 153 (SLH 2006), money transmitters were required to be licensed by DFI on or before July 1, 2007. T here are currently 39 money transm itters, operating from approximately a thousand locations, licensed to do business in Hawaii, a large and diverse population attesting to the impact of this segment of the financial services industry on Hawaii's consumers. In 2011, DFI 's Field Examination Branch staff performed examinations of five money transmitters, two of which were joint examinations with other states and performed at the licensees' principal offices outside the State of Hawaii. Three of the examinations also included brief reviews of some of the money transmitter's authorized delegate locations. Mortgage Loan Origination Regulation . As noted in previous reports, in response to the federal S.A.F.E Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (federal SAFE Act ), Hawaii's version of the federal SAFE Act (HRS Chapter 454F) , was enacted in 2009 wi th the passage of Act 32( SSLH 2009). Chapter 454F requires that persons engaged in mortgage loan origination activities related to Hawaii residential real estate to be licensed by DFI as mortgage loan originators (MLOs) and mortgage loan originator companies (MLOCs). In compliance with the federal SAFE Act, Chapter 454F, requires background checks, pre -licensing education and testing, and continuing education, and also requires that Hawaii participate in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS). This online system is designed to replace individual state's existing mortgage licensing application forms, systems, and processes. Persons wishing to apply for a license, or amend , surrender/cancel or renew a license do so through NMLS. DFI devoted considerable resources in late 2010 and continuing in 2011 to initially license over 800 MLOs, 191 MLOCs and 100 MLOC branches as of September 30, 2011. Beginning May 15, 2011, DFI began reviewing the quarterly m ortgage call reports that licensees are required to file through NMLS. The quarterly mortgage call reports are reports showing the mortgage loan activity in a company and by individual mortgage loan originators. Since this is a new report, the licensing examiners have spent considerable time with companies who did not file the report correctly. Starting in November, 2011, DFI began the first annual renewal of the MLO, MLOC and MLOC branch licenses. The Division was an early participant in the multi -state MLOC examinations which examine compliance in accordance to federal and state regulatory schemes. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Financial Institutions (DFI) - 39 - Mortgage Servicer Regulation . DFI began licensing mortgage servicers under Chapter 454M, HRS, effective July 1, 2010 and conducted the first annual renew al of these licenses in 2011. While consolidation in the mortgage servicing industry indicated an initial estimate of approximately 20 mortgage servicers that would be licensed under this new law, as of year -end 2010, DFI had licensed a total of 56 mortga ge servicers and that number had increased to 63 as of November 2011, with additional applications still being received. Continued Development of DFI's Emergency Preparedness Program . DFI continues to develop, implement, and rehearse multiple level emer gency preparedness contingency plans. Maintaining and safeguarding an adequate supply of currency to the public as well as efficient access to deposit accounts is the main objective of these plans. As the overall coordinator for financial institutions operating in Hawaii, DFI is a strategic partner in HawaiiFIRST, a financial industry business continuity planning coalition established to address Homeland Security issues affecting the local financial industry, to develop and maintain relationships with cit y, county, State and federal agencies, and private industries that have an impact on the local business community, and to enhance the financial industry's capability to respond to and recover from disasters. DFI, together with HawaiiFIRST, also continues to maintain and periodically test a statewide emergency communications plan which includes all Hawaii depository financial institutions. To ensure that DFI's staff has the ability to work remotely during emergencies, including an H1N1 pandemic, DFI has r eplaced nearly all of its desktop computers with laptops. The laptops, coupled with VPN access to the Department's network via a browser and wireless broadband access to the Internet, provide for establishment of remote work sites and/or telecommuting ope rations in the event of an emergency, permitting the continuation of secure communication with city, county, s tate and federal agencies, and the private sector, to facilitate the financial industry's ability to respond to and recover from disastrous situat ions. DFI will continue to work with the State's financial institutions (primarily as a strategic partner with HawaiiFIRST), State Civil Defense, federal regulators, the Hawaii Bankers Association, the Hawaii Credit Union League, and others to ensure that robust and comprehensive emergency preparedness plans are developed, implemented and maintained going forward. In addition, the Commissioner is a member of the Federal Emergency Management Agency Community Emergency Response Team (FEMA CERT) and undergoe s training with FEMA to prepare for major emergencies. Reaccreditation . DFI is accredited by CSBS, the industry association for all state financial service regulatory agencies in the United States. CSBS administers its national accreditation program for state financial service regulatory agencies to ensure that the management and staff of these agencies are knowledgeable, appropriately organized, staffed, funded and trained to carry out their responsibilities, which include s authorizing, regulating and s upervising of state -chartered financial institutions. DFI was originally accredited by CSBS in 1990. Each year thereafter, DFI has been required to file a comprehensive report of its activities, which is evaluated by CSBS, to retain to determine whether DFI 's accredited status will be renewed for another year. Every 5 years , the CSBS staff visits DFI on site in Honolulu to conduct an exhaustive review of every facet of the Division's operations; interview managers, supervisors and staff; and evaluate the overall effectiveness of the program. DFI underwent such an examination in March of 2005, and received reaccreditation in late 2005. DFI was scheduled for an on- site reaccreditation review in December 2010, however, DFI had been working with CSBS to det ermine whether past employee furloughs, spending restrictions, and vacant positions would result in DFI 's 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Division of Financial Institutions (DFI) - 40 - accreditation being subject to probation, suspension or revocation, and what the impact any of these actions would have on an on- site reaccreditatio n review. Discussions with CSBS continued in 2011, and DFI is now actively working toward an on -site review in 2012. Bank, Financial Services Loan Company, and Escrow Depository Examination Programs . During the period that furloughs were imposed in the final quarter of 2009 through the first quarter of 2011, DFI examiners were only able to take a limited lead role in one examination in late- 2010. However, DFI continued to work closely with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and with the FDIC in developing and coordinating the year -round examination program for Hawaii's two largest banks and continued to participate in consumer compliance examinations conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the FDIC. Despite continuing staff shortages, DFI is currently coordinating with the FDIC to take the lead role in two examinations in 2012. In 2011, DFI also independently conducted several escrow depository compliance examinations and nondepository financial services loan company complianc e examinations, as well as investigations arising out of complaints. Due to the continuing economic stresses affecting the local economy and the financial industry in 2011, DFI was involved jointly with federal agencies in monitoring progress in ongoing f ormal and informal supervisory actions imposed in 2009 and 2010, as well as taking new supervisory actions in 2011 against various regulated institutions. The CRF financial summary relating to DFI for FY 10-11 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $2,094,405 $362,448 $2,456,853 $3,429,771 CONCLUSION During 2011, while DFI maintained its established regulatory, supervisory, and licensing programs, and devoted considerable resources to developing and im plementing the new mortgage servicer and mortgage loan originator programs, continued emphasis was directed towards responses to ongoing deterioration across all aspects of the global financial services sector. The impact of the \"sub -prime mortgage crisis\" which has now led to the current \"global financial crisis\", with its attendant disruption to the normal pattern of financial services product delivery, has affected both our local economy and all financial institutions operating in the State. DFI conti nues to aggressively respond to these rapidly changing global and local economic conditions and pursues the active regulation and supervision of Hawaii -chartered financial institutions to preserve their safety and soundness and protect the rights of deposi tors, borrowers, consumers and other members of the community. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 41 - INSURANCE DIVISION (ID) website: www.hawaii.gov/dcca/ins e-mail address: insurance@dcca.hawaii.gov OVERVIEW The Insurance Division 's (ID) goal and mission is to ensure that commercial a nd individual consumers are provided with insurance services meeting acceptable standards of quality, equity, and dependability at fair rates by establishing and enforcing appropriate service standards and fairly administering the Insurance Code.

Prosecutors and investigators received training i n arson investigations, medical provider fraud, social networking, medical billing and coding errors, and attended the National Health Care Anti -Fraud Association's Annual Training Conference. Rate and Policy Analysis Branch. During fiscal year 2010- 2011, 3,854 filings were reviewed; in the preceding year (fiscal year 2009- 2010), 4,049 filings were reviewed. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Insurance Division (ID) - 47 - Hawaii participates in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) filing process known as SERFF or the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing. Hawaii began accepting life insurance products via SERFF in 2001; limited property and casualty lines in 2007 and all lines in 2008. A total of 3,611 electronic filings were processed through SERFF during the fiscal year; in the preceding fiscal year, 3,135 electronic filings were processed through SERFF. Act 104, Session Laws of Hawaii (SLH) 2004, established Article 30, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 431, which permits Hawaii to join with other states to regulate designated insur ance products through an interstate insurance product regulation compact (IIPRC). The Commission for the IIPRC became effective May 2006 when 26 states representing a total exceeding 40% of the premium volume for life, annuities, disability income, and long -term care insurance products established similar statutes. A total of 41 jurisdictions are currently members of IIPRC. The IIPRC has since adopted bylaws, operating procedures, and 75 product standards on life and annuity products and has reviewed 264 filings for approval this fiscal year. Long-Term Care Insurance: Pursuant to Act 233, SLH 2007, insurers transacting long -term care insurance business on or after January 1, 2008 were required to comply with new and amended disclosure standards and actuarial ratemaking standards. One new insurer filed to transact long term -care insurance business. There are 57 insurers with rates and forms on file in Hawaii; however, some insurers may not be issuing new policies. Medicare Supplement Insurance: Pursua nt to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, enacted December 8, 2003, Medicare supplement plans no longer offer prescription drug coverage. As of January 2006, Medicare eligibles were able to enroll in federal Medicare Part D. Pursuant to the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) of 2008, revised standardized benefit plans will be in effect June 1, 2010. Hawaii M edicare supplement insurance laws were amended in conformance with MIPPA. Thus, companies were required to cease new issues of existing plans effective June 1, 2010, and new plans complying with the revised federal standards were required to be filed. There are eight licensed issuers of Medicare supplement insurance in Hawaii with o ne or more standardized plans under the new guidelines. The significant filings approved or impacting the rates or the policies issued during the fiscal year were as follows: Commercial Multiperil: On September 1, 2011, Hawaii Insurance Bureau, Inc. (HI B) submitted loss cos ts associated with the major b usiness owners coverage's with an overall impact of - 0.4%. Commercial Property : On May 27, 2011, HIB's advisory loss costs for class -rated and specifically - rated properties were approved with an overall i mpact of - 12.3%. The filing was based on AIR -Worldwide Corporations' Hawaii Tropical Cyclone Model. Homeowners : On March 4, 2011, revisions to HIB's homeowners loss costs excluding the peril of hurricane were approved with an overall impact of - 3.9%. Workers' Compensation: On September 1, 2010, revisions to the National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc.'s workers' compensation loss costs, to reflect experience and statutory 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Insurance Division (ID) - 48 - benefits as of January 1, 2010, were approved with an overall impact of 0.0%. This was the seventh consecutive year that advisory loss costs did not increase based on Hawaii employers' claims experience. Motor Vehicle : On May 20, 2011, HIB's revised personal auto advisory loss costs were approved with an overall impact of - 11.0%. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, and POLICIES ID's goal is to ensure that consumers are provided with insurance services meeting acceptable standards of quality, equity, and dependability at fair rates by establishing , implementing, and enforcing appropriate ser vice standards and fairly administering the Insurance Code and other applicable laws . Short and Long Term Goals of the Division: (1) Meet its s tatutorily mandated requirement; (2) Address national insurance issues by working with other state regulators a nd the NAIC ; (3) Protect policyholders by examining insurers/captive insurers to ensure financial compliance with statutory requirement s and strive for early detection of any potentially hazardous financial conditions to preserve the assets of the insurer ; (4) Increase the efficiency of the ID's operations ; (5) Retain the ID's accreditation by the N AIC; and (6) Provide and improve Internet access by the public for insurance licensees' public data and provide on- line processing, rate and policy form filings, information on licensing and filing requirements , electronic payments of fees and premium taxes, and forms for licensees. Objectives and Policies Setting Forth How Goals Can and Will be Accomplished. 1. The ID will strive to meet the mandated statutory requirements for the Insurance C ode through proper personnel and case load management. 2. The ID participates in the proceedings of the NAIC by attending i ts meeting s to address regulatory, market place , and national issues , including the Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"PPACA\") of 2010. The members of NAIC are all of the state insurance regulators. The ID is actively involved with NAIC by its membership on various committees and currently is vice chair of a committee . 3. Protect pol icyholder s from insolvent insurers by continuing the timely review and detailed analysis of financial statements filed by insurers to assure their compliance with the statutory financial requirements. Perform on site financial examination at least once ev ery five years or more frequently as necessary as required by statute. Incorporate risk assessment methodology into the examiner's financial analysis work product. 4. To increase efficiency of operations, the ID is continuously improving its computerizat ion and the use of the Internet. The ID developed a database named the Hawaii Insurance Division System (HIDS), which is an integrated system with the licensing module at its core and subsystems to support t he other functions of the ID. HIDS provides bet ter management of the large volume of transactions handled by the ID. It has greatly reduced the manual processes and has allowed for the dissemination of informa tion to the public through the I nternet. The ID has completed its HIDS enhancement project w hich modified existing applications and developed an Examination application. The Examination application allow s for the electronic submittal and collection of premium tax returns and payments. With these modifications to HIDS, continued interfaces with the NAIC and the Hawaii Information Consortium (they 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Insurance Division (ID) - 49 - provide the Internet porta l for the State of Hawaii's web site) , databases can be built. These interfaces will continue to improve the efficiency of the ID and provide better services and information vi a the web to consumers and insurance licensees. 5. Accreditation of state insurance regulators is administered by the NAIC and requires state insurance departments/divisions to have and maintain adequate statutory and administrative authority as well as s ufficient resources to effectively regulate the financial solvency of insurance companies. In 2011, the ID was reaccredited for another five years, the most that a state can achieve. In order to maintain the accreditation, the ID will ensure the required level of funding in the budget for its financial surveillance resources. Also, the ID will introduce legislation for the adoption of NAIC model laws required for accreditation. 6. The ID's web site all ows the public to access general information on insurance, information on licensees, compar ative auto and homeowners premiums, and information on how to file a complaint. Producers can now apply for a license, renew their licenses and submit appointments on- line. The ID has several projects which have created additional interfaces from HIDS to the NAIC and the Hawaii Information Consortium databases. The current interface enhancement projects include allowing producers to update contact information, continuing education providers can submit completed course credits on- line and course schedules, time and locations will be able to be found on the website . The ID worked with the NAIC to implement additional lines of filing through SERFF. 7. President Obama signed the PPACA into law in 2010. The requirements of P PACA are many and specific time frames for states to meet those requirements are set. One of these is the State option of establishing a health exchange. The Division was awarded a $1 million dollar grant from the federal Department of H ealth and H uman Services (\"DHHS\") in 2010 to study the idea of creating a health insurance exchange in Hawaii. Health insurance exchanges are part of PPACA and are designed to allow individuals and small businesses to purchase federally qualified health plans written by private insurer and obtain federal subsidies. E xchanges must also provide a front end for Medicaid. The Division formed a task force to study exchange -related issues and expect s to procure at least one consultant to assist its effort . Enabling legislatio n to implement the Exchange in Hawai`i was passed in 2011. 8. The Insurance Division received another $1 million dollar grant from DHHS in 2010 to build a computer system that can report data relating to health premium rate regulation. The Division is explo ring various options to meet this goal including using the National Association of Insurance Commissioner 's System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing and modifying the Division's current database to enable the reporting. The Division does not expect to s pend the entire $1 million on this project. 9. The Insurance Division also received a $3 million dollar grant from DHHS to establish or enhanc e a meaningful and comprehensive effective rate review program that is transparent to the public, enrollees, policyholders and to DHHS. The program is to thoroughly evaluate rate filings and, to the extent permitted by applicable State law, approve or disapprove those filings. 10. The passage of the Nonadmitted Reinsurance and Reform Act of 2010, required states to have i n place by July 21, 2011, a working mechanism in place whereby surplus lines premium taxes are collected and distributed in a uniform manner. Enabling legislation to implement a mechanism in Hawai`i 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Insurance Division (ID) - 50 - was passed in 2011. The Division is working with other states through the NAIC to coordinate this mechanism.

As of May 5, 2011, the OAH became responsible for the administration of Mortgage Foreclosure Dispute Resolution Program (MFDRP) established in Act 48 (SLH 2011). The MFDRP provides owner - occupan ts an opportunity to negotiate an agreement that avoids foreclosure or mitigates damages in cases where foreclosure is unavoidable. With the input and assistance of the Judiciary's Center for Alternative Dispute Resolution, the MFDRP contracted with three entities to provide neutral services for the dispute resolution process, participated in the training of neutrals, contracted for and assisted with the creation of a website for purposes of providing access to the Program for borrowers, lenders, and neutr als, and the Program up and running by October 1, 2011. An annual report is separately produced detailing MFDRP activities. Lastly, OAH also provides administrative support to the Medical Claims Conciliation Panel (MCCP) and the Design Claims Conciliation Panel . The MCCP program is responsible for conducting informal conciliation hearings on claims against health care providers before such claims can be filed as lawsuits. Similarly, the DCCP program is responsible for conducting informal conciliation hearings on claims against design professionals (engineers, architects, surveyors, and landscape architects) before such claims can be filed as lawsuits. The decisions of the MCCP and DCCP panels are advisory in nature and are not binding on the parties, i n the event that any party still wishes to pursue the matter via the courts. An annual report is separately produced of MCCP and DCCP activities. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) - 52 - COMPOSITION The OAH staff responsible for CRF related activities are: Senior Hearings Officer, division secretary, four additional hearings officers , two legal clerks, and an MCCP/DCCP clerk. In addition, a program specialist and an office assistant were hired to design, implement and administer the MFDRP. The office is physically located in the King Kalak aua Building, 335 Merchant Street, Suite 100. The OAH mailing address is: Office of Administrative Hearings, 335 Merchant Street, Suite 100, Honolulu, Hawai`i 96813; table summarizes the CRF -related activities conducted by OAH for the 2010- 2011 fiscal year : Type of Proceeding Conducted Number Pre-hearing conferences 64 Status conferences 87 Motions 26 Hearings 113 The following table summarizes the number of cases and the relative percentage of CRF -related activities conducted by OAH for the 2010 -2011 fiscal year .

GOALS and OBJECTIVES The primary goal and objective of the Office of Administrative Hearings has always been to conduct contested case hearings and issu e recommended decisions, in a fair and impartial manner, as expeditiously as possible. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) - 53 - In order to tr ack the processing of cases from the date of filing to the issuance of a final order, pursuant to directives from the Director's Office, as of July 1, 2005, the Office of Administrative Hearings has implemented additional processes and procedures to ensure that all cases are timely processed: 1. Revising the Office of Administrative Hearings data base to include additional data fields so that all pending cases can be tracked for timeliness throughout the entire hearings process; 2. Physical inventories of all Office of Administrative Hearings cases in February and July of each year, and 3. Specific procedures for the disposition of cases in which no action has been taken by the parties. The secondary goal and objective of the Office of Administrative Hear ings is to make all of the decisions issued by the Boards, Commissions, Programs , and Divisions that are part of the CRF , available to the public. All procurement protest decisions are currently available online shortly after the parties themselves are no tified of the decisions. All special education decisions are made available online by the Department of Education. While decisions in other areas had been posted online since January 2005, they were taken off line in 2009. The Office of Administrative H earings is working with the DCCA's Information Systems and Communications Office to have these decisions posted online again in a more up to date format. New software has been purchased that will redact decisions of personal information protected by priva cy laws and also make the online decisions ADA complaint. These decisions should be posted on line, using the new software, by the end of 2011. CONCLUSION The Office of Administrative Hearings will continue to work closely with all of the Boards, Commissions, and Programs that are part of the CRF, as well as with the other DCCA divisions that are also integral parts of the professional and vocational licensing system, to ensure that cases are processed as expeditiously as possible, and that all particip ating entities will have access to the OAH case data base and archives of past decisions. 2011C ompliance Resolution Fund Report - 54 - OFFICE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION (OCP) Website: www.hawaii.gov/dcca/ocp E-mail address: ocp@dcca.hawaii.gov OVERVIEW The Office of Consumer Protection (OCP) is empowered by statute to enforce the state 's consumer protection laws. Functionally, this means that OCP has jurisdiction over a wide range of businesses and activities, including both regulated and unregulated industries. OCP handles many different types of complaints , such as those involving: advertising violations, door -to-door sales, solar energy devices, gift certificates, offers of gifts and prizes, going out of business sales, charitable solicitations, refunds and exchanges, collection practices, credit sales, health clubs, towing, fine prints and motor vehicle rentals. See Table 1, Laws Enforced by OC P. OCP is also the pri mary government agency in the State of Hawaii responsible for reviewing and investigating allegations of unfair or deceptive trade practices in consumer transactions. Finally, OCP also provides general information on the Residential Landlord- Tenant Code to consumers . OCP has adopted a number of different strategies to ensure that its mission is achieved in a meaningful and cost -effective manner. First, the staff tries to prioritize cases according to the seriousness of the violati on. To help achieve this goal , investigations of actions that present significant consumer harm are \"fast -tracked\" for immediate legal intervention. Second, in an effort to proactively address perceived consumer problems, the office initiates investigati ons of problematic commercial practices. Third, staff persons attempt to provide as much assistance by telephone as possible, so as to enabl e a consumer to resolve their concern(s) without government intervention. Fourth, emphasis is placed on consumer a nd business education, through public service announcements, Consumer Dial messages, public informational forums, speaking engagements, media releases, and the dissemination of brochures. Finally, OCP partners with numerous public and private agencies to promote consumer protection throughout the State of Hawaii. In view of the successful implementation of these goals during the past few years, OCP will continue to focus on them throughout the foreseeable future, including during the next five years. OCP 's main office is located at the Leiopapa A Kamehameha Building (State Office Tower) , 235 South Beretania Street, Suite 801, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. It shares offices with the Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) in Wailuku, Maui at 1063 Lower Ma in Street, Suite C -216 and in Hilo, Hawaii at 345 Kekuanaoa Street, Suite 12. OCP's website address is www.hawaii.gov/dcca/ocp . Its functions are divided into four basic sections: intake, investigation, landl ord-tenant, and legal. Composition OCP is organized under the following four sections: The Consumer Resource Center Intake Section - phone: (808) 587- 3222 The Consumer Resource Center (CRC) handles the intake of complaints for OCP. CRC is staffed by investigators who answer consumers' questions, distribute OCP complaint forms to consumers, receive written consumer complaints, and forward cases to OCP for review, closing or further investigation. In addition, a division within CRC answers telephonic requests for prior complaint history. If circumstances permit, consumers also have the opportunity to visit OCP's Honolulu office to view the actual case files. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 55 - Prior to the release of any file, OCP's staff reviews its contents to ensure that legally pro tected private information is not disclosed. See Table 2, statistics on OCP Information Requests. The Investigation Section - phone: (808) 586 -2630 OCP's investigation section receives cases from CRC and gathers evidence to determine whether violations of consumer laws have occurred. Investigators' tasks include site inspections, witness interviews, document collection, evidentiary analysis, report writing and the service of subpoenas. See Table 3, Number of OCP Complaints Filed; Table 4, Numerical Br eakdown of Dispositions of All OCP Cases; and Table 5, OCP Complaints by Subject Matter for FY 10 -11 statistics. The Landlord- Tenant Section - phone (808) 586- OCP operates the Landlord- Tenant Volunteer Center. The Center is s taffed primarily by OCP investigators who answer questions about landlord- tenant issues. The Landlord- Tenant Center does not represent landlords or tenants in court or provide legal advice; its role is limited to providing information regarding the particular laws relating to landlords and tenants. The office supplements this function by making available additional information on the department's 24- hour Consumer Dial Information Service, and on its website. The office also disseminates information to interested parties through its very popular landlord-tenant handbook, of which thousands are distributed each year. The Legal Section - phone: (808) 586- 2636 The Leg al Section consists of staff attorneys who file civil actions against consumer law violators. Attorneys also engage in informal and formal resolution of cases prior to filing lawsuits. OCP also provides the following services: Consumer Education In an effort to enhance consumer awareness of various consumer problems, OCP continuously strives to promote consumer education. The office issues press releases on a variety of consumer topics, and prepares and distributes written materials to provide specifi c consumer information. OCP also provides consumer information through its website and its Consumer Dial Information Service, in which interested parties can call 24 hours a day and receive information on a variety of topics. In addition, OCP staff has p articipated in numerous educational forums in which thousands of consumers and business persons have received extensive information about consumer protection in Hawaii. Neighbor Island Assistance Requests OCP staff offers assistance to neighbor islands residents in DCCA related matters or other areas, as is reflected in the attached Table 6. In addition, the office's neighbor island staff has been trained in the technical operation of the State's Video Conference Center equipment and provides technical assistance to the department's hearings office so that neighbor island administrative hearings can be conducted through video conferencing. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES During the next five years, OCP will strive to fulfill its statutory mandate by fostering a f air and safe marketplace for consumers and businesses alike. In this regard, it will continue to investigate allegations relating to unfair or deceptive trade practices, enforce Hawaii's consumer laws, and educate 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 56 - consumers and businesses on their respect ive rights and responsibilities. The specific goals and objectives will include: Maintaining fiscal responsibility on behalf of DCCA/OCP; Support innovative legislation designed to protect consumers in the State of Hawaii; Proactively initiate cases ag ainst problematic business practices before there is widespread consumer harm; Disseminate consumer education to the largest possible populace; Facilitate the exchange of information with a wide array of law enforcement agencies; Develop access to inves tigative data bases; and Provide in- house training to OCP investigators and attorneys. ACCOMPLISHMENTS Consumer Education During the past several years, OCP has educated tens of thousands of citizens by conducting workshops for senior care providers, speaking to business leaders and consumers regarding consumer protection and training Hawaii attorneys and military legal assistance personnel on consumer protection law. Most recently, OCP has focused on the growing problems of identity theft and mortga ge fraud by providing important information to thousands of Hawaii residents on how to avoid being victimized. Cases OCP handled significant cases in 2011 involving nearly every area of consumer protection. It filed and resolved numerous cases relating to alleged violations of Hawaii's laws governing mortgage fraud, unaccredited degree granting institutions, identity theft, gift certificates, car rentals, credit practices, marketing protection, living trusts, door -to-door sales, refund and exchanges, and unfair or deceptive trade practices. OCP's involvement successfully resulted in recovering approximately 1.6 million dollars from respondents for having engaged in alleged unfair or deceptive trade practices and thousands of dollars in restitution for H awaii consumers. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 57 - LEGISLATION OCP testified and provided input on virtually every measure relating to consumer protection at the Hawaii Legislature, including those relating to mortgage foreclosures, Uniform Information Practices Act, gift certificates , Automatic Contract Renewal Clauses Act 139, Motor Vehicle Rental Fees and Insurance Act 104, and credit practices. The CRF f inancial summa ry relating to OCP for FY 10- 11 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $1,196.485 $174,409 $1,370,894 $1,649,073 CONCLUSION OCP continues to receive a large number of requests for assistance. Consumer complaints are diverse in nature and range from an isolated case to problems that affect every Hawaii citizen. Thro ugh regular training and information exchange, OCP's staff attempts to keep abreast of the latest consumer problems and \"rip- offs,\" in order to prevent them from occurring and, if this is not possible then to limit their impact. Through its efforts in taking proactive measures to prevent wide -scale consumer problems before they occur, and through its enforcement actions and consumer and business education, OCP strives to meet the consumer protection needs of this community, and fulfill its mission. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report - 58 - Table 1: Laws Enforced by OCP HRS \u00a7209 -9 Price Gouging HRS \u00a7290 -11 Towing HRS \u00a7437 Motor Vehicle Sales - Spot Delivery HRS Chapter 437D Motor Vehicle Rental HRS Chapter 446 Debt Adjusting HRS Chapter 446E Unaccredited Degree Granting Institutions HRS Chap ter 457G Occupational Therapists HRS Chapter 467B Charitable Solicitations HRS Chapter 476 Credit Sales5 HRS Chapter 477E Fair Credit Extension HRS \u00a7480 -2 Unfair and Deceptive Acts or Practices6 HRS Chapter 480D Collection Practices7 HRS Chapter 48 0E Mortgage Rescue Fraud Prevention Act HRS Chapter 480F Check Cashing HRS Chapter 481A Uniform Deceptive Trade Practice Act HRS Chapter 481B Unfair and Deceptive Practices, including Unsolicited Goods; Commercial Mail Order Buying Clubs; Offers of Gifts or Prizes; Aid to Handicapped; Refunds and Exchanges; Solar Energy Devices; Sales of Computers; Sensitivity Awareness Group Seminar; Credit Repair Organizations; Gift Certificates; Ticket Sales HRS Chapter 481C Door -to-door Sales HRS Chapter 481D Going Out of Business Sales HRS Chapter 481F Sale of Fine Prints HRS Chapter 481H Water Treatment Units HRS Chapter 481K Assistive Technology Warranty Act HRS Chapter 481L Motor Vehicle Lease Transactions HRS Chapter 481M Rent -to-Own HRS Chapter 481P Telem arketing Fraud Prevention Act HRS Chapter 481 X Service Contracts HRS Chapter 486N Health Clubs HRS \u00a7487 -5 Laws Enacted and Rules Adopted for the purpose of consumer protection8 HRS Chapter 487A Plain Language Law HRS 487J Social Security Number Prote ction HRS 487H Notification of Security Breaches HRS 487R Destruction of Personal Information Records HRS Chapter 506 Reverse Mortgage Loan HRS Chapter 521 Landlord Tenant Code9 Act 282 (1997) Assistive Device Warranty Act Act 137 (2008) Mortgage Re scue Fraud Prevention Act 5 HRS \u00a7476- 31.

68 - PROFESSIONAL AND VOCATIONAL LICENSING DIVISION (PVL) website: hawaii.gov/dcca /pvl e-mail address: pvl@dcca.hawaii.gov OVERVIEW The Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) is responsible for implementing the licensing regulations for forty -seven (47) different professions and vocations. Twenty -five (25) licensing regulatory boards and commissions are administ ratively attached to DCC A/PVL, as well as twenty -two (22) licensing programs (those without a board or commission). The division provides staff support to the licensing regulatory boards, handles applications and licenses, review s and processes renewals , and maintains license records. The division provides guidance for proper implementation of the licensing laws and administrative rules for the forty -seven (47) professions and vocations. Additionally, PVL responds to phone inquiries on whether a person or entity is pr operly licensed. This is a service that can assist consumers in making a decision on whether or not to utilize the services of the person or entity . PVL's offerings to promote accessibi lity for licens ing information on the Internet are very user friendly. PVL continues to explore ways to enhance public accessibility to licensing information, the licensing process, and its licensee roster. PVL's web page, a site that provides general licensing information for all 47 licensing areas, features fillable license applications, publications, links to Hawaii Revised Statutes and Hawaii Administrative Rules, as well as a means to request an application or contact the board or program staff via e -mail. The website address is http://hawaii.gov/dcca /pvl. The website also includes a Geographic al Report of current licensees by licensee type, by island, and by type of ent ity. It is updated regularly to reflect the number of current licensees who have been issu ed licenses by PVL. It is a useful tool for those who are interested in the number of licensees by their professions and their geographic locations. Public accessibility to licensee information is enhanced by the PVL's License Search and List Builder si tes, both of which a re fully interactive site s. The License Search site enables the public to obtain basic information about businesses and individuals that hold professional and vocational licenses issued by PVL including license ID number, whether the l icense is active or inactive, current status, original date of licensure, expiration date of licensure, current and former persons/businesses/tradenames, information on \"conditional license\" codes and descriptions, and any formal disciplinary action inform ation against the licensee. The List Builder site also enables the public t o access and order a licensee roster online. The roster may be ordered by license number, license name, and other identifying public information. Lists are available for download within twenty -four (24) hours of making the request. Updates to the online information to both sites occur within thirty ( 30) minutes of the update to the PVL licensing database. Feedback received on these sites indicates that the site s benefit a wide r ange of users, including consumers, licensees, employers, and government agencies, both in Hawaii and out -of-state. Links to other DCCA sites provide easy access to additional useful consumer information, such as a licensee's complaints history. The webs ite address for PVL's Online Services is http://hawaii.gov/dcca/pvl/e_services . This is the eleventh year that online renewals are being made available to licensees. This entirely paperless process enables licensees to complete, file, and pay for their license renewals electronically. A fair share of renewals are still mailed in by licensees and manually processed by PVL, but by far, a majority of the renewals are done online . Online renewals are available at http://hawaii.gov/dcca/pvl/e_services . 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 69 - With regard to fiscal matters, PVL's goal is to maintain the division as a special- funded and entirely self-sufficient program. Through careful budgeting of PVL revenues and expenditures, PVL endeavors t o maintain self -sufficiency, while expanding and improving services to the public. Internally, PVL continues to evaluate and re- engineer its processes for efficiency and streamlining, and to develop alternative means of delivery of licensing information t o the public. PVL is located at 335 Merchant Street, on the third floor of the King Kalakaua Building , Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. Composition PVL is divided into four branches: Licensing Branch (Phone 586- 3000) is comprised of the Applications Section and the Records Section. The Applications Section 1) assists with the review and processing of applications for licensure ; 2) issues licenses; and 3) maintains records of licensing applications. The Applications Section staff, on behalf of the boards, c ommissions, and programs, conducts highly intensive reviews of all initial licensing applications, determines the status of such applications, and, in some instances, makes the final determination to either issue or defer issuing licenses. The Applications Section also performs customer service duties by answering the main public call -in line of the division which normally exceeds 5,000 calls per month. The Records Section is responsible for renewing , restoring and reactivating licenses and maintaining re cords of all licensees. The Records Section staff is also involved with performing customer service duties by assisting the public with licensing information at the main PVL w alk-in counter. Both sections of the Licensing Branch utilize the PVL computeri zed licensing database to provide immediate information pertaining to applicants and licensees. Inquirers may obtain information on whether a person or entity is licensed, the original date of licensure, the current status of licensure, the expiration dat e of the license, Hawaii disciplinary sanctions imposed on the licensee, and, if applicable, whether mandatory insurance (e.g., workers compensation, liability insurance) is current and in effect . Examination Branch (Phone 586- 2711) arranges for the admin istration of licensing examinations on behalf of the boards, commissions, and programs, confirms the validity and reliability of exams, revises board constructed examinations to ensure their continued validity and reliability, and advises boards, when necessary, on the technical aspects of examinations. In addition, the Examination Branch transmits and verifies to various testing organizations the eligibility information of applicants seeking licensure in Hawaii who have been deemed approved to sit for the examination. The Examination Branch also sees that the approved applicants are provided the necessary pre -examination information , and generates and provides the applicants their post -examination score reports. Moreover, the Examination Branch reviews and processes requests by applicants for special examination accommodations with regard to the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition, the Examination Branch maintains the examination records for applicants and licensees. Administration Branch (Phone 586- 2690) serves as the liaison between the dire ctor of the department and the twenty -five ( 25) boards , commissions , and twenty -two ( 22) regulatory programs administratively attached to DCCA. On a daily b asis, the Administration Branch (comprised of a Staff Attorney, Executive Officers, Program Specialists, and Secretaries) handles board affairs such as the coordinating, preparing, facilitating , and recording of board meetings; ensuring board compliance with applicable laws that guide and direct their conduct; and implementing board decisions on applications, 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 70 - policies and procedures, and disciplinary actions. The Administration Branch also responds to requests for interpretation of the licensing laws and rules , oversees li censing and examination activi ties, and guides and assists with regulatory compliance issues. The same activities are done for the twenty -two (22) programs (absent the necessity of board meetings) on behalf of the director of the department. There are also substantial coordination and facilitation activities performed by the Administration Branch with other state, county, and federal agencies involved with licensing and regulatory issues. Real Estate Branch (Phone 586- 2643) serves as the liaison between the director of the department and the Real Estate Commission (REC), and performs the same functions as the Administration Branch for real estate licensing and regulation, and condominium property regimes. With the largest volume of applicants, licensees, and registrations, the Branch (comprised of a Supervising Executive Officer, an Executive Officer, Real Estate Specialists, Condominium Specialists, Secretarial and Clerical staff) administers the Real Estate Recovery Fund, Real Estate Education Trust Fund, and the Condominium Educati on Trust Fund. The Branch also administers education and research programs in the field of real estate and condominiums. Information on the programs, financial reports, and the Commission's annual report may be reviewed at the Branch's website: http://hawaii.gov/hirec . In summary, all Branches within PVL work toward efficient and expedient processing of applications, licenses, and renewals to ensure the public has choices amongst competent and licensed practi tioners. For a statistical summary of PVL key activities, see Table 1: PVL Statistical Overview; Table 2: Total N umber of Current PVL Licensees; Table 3: Total N umber and (Percentage) of Licenses Renewed Online; and Table 4: Total Number of Email Inquiries. Accomplishments and Performance Measures This year additional improvements were made to existing PVL online systems and their websites as follows: New license types were added to the online renewal system which included Electrician, Journeyman (active and inactive) ; Electrician, Journeyman Industrial (active and inactive) ; Electrician, Journeyman Specialty (active and inactive) ; Electrician, Maintenance (active and inactive) ; Electrician, Supervising (active and inactive) ; Electrician, Supervisi ng Industrial (active and inactive) ; Electrician, Supervising Specialty (active and inactive) ; Motor Vehicle Repair - Registered Mechanic (active) ; and Motor Vehicle Repair Dealer (active) . A new webpage for the Respiratory Therapist (RT) Program was adde d to the division's website. The implementation of the respiratory therapist program took effect on July 1, 2011. The webpage includes contact information, important announcements, the RT statute, and other pertinent information. The fillable applicatio n form is also available on the website. Significant Online User Activities In pursuing the division's objective of improving and expanding customer online service s, PVL saw the number of online renewals increase for businesses and professionals. In FY 11, the online renewal user rate was 87.35%, while the corresponding FY 09 biennial renewal user rate was 81.29%, resulting in a 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 71 - 6.06% increase in the user rate. In FY 10, the online renewal user rate was 82.81%, while the corresponding FY 08 biennial use r rate was 76.48%, resulting in a 6.33% increase in the user rate. PVL continued its Customer Appreciation Credit (CAC) by offering licensees a 25% CAC discount through FY 11 online renewals. In FY 11, total savings to licensees was $608,731; in FY 10, it was $787,039; in FY 09, it was $553,440; and in FY 08, it was $689,983. In FY 07 and FY 06, a 10% CAC discount was offered. In FY 07, the total savings was $109,024 and in FY 06, the total savings was $188,140. Since the inception of the CAC in FY 06 through FY 11, total savings for licensees that renewed online amounted to $2,945,962. The CAC discount was designed to serve as an appreciation to PVL licen sees who used the online system and as an incentive for more licensees to adopt the online renewal process . The performance of this project will continue to be measured by the ability to afford the CAC discount to all licensees and by seeing an increase in our online renewal user rate. PVL continued to absorb transaction fees that otherwise would have been passed on to licensees who used the online renewal system. With the online system, licensees were provided the ability to pay by Echeck and by credit card, all of which incurred service fees charged by PVL's online system provider. However, instea d of passing on these service fees to our licensees, PVL continued to pay these costs using its online renewal revenue. For FY 11, PVL paid $286,806 in service fees. The total to- date service fees paid by PVL since the inception of the online renewal sys tem (FY 01) is $2,050,477. For PVL 's License Search online system, t here were 3,332,318 \"page views\" during FY 11. This service is a very popular, valuable, and useful tool for those who want information on licensees . The public can check to see if a l icensee is currently licensed and find out if there are any formal disciplinary actions against the licensee, in addition to other pertinent information. Significant Branch Activities The Examination Branch was able to maintain processing of applicant eligibility for testing as well as post -examination results in a timely manner. Applicants who needed to meet an exam requirement for licensure were able to take an exam and, in some cases, receive his/her results within 24 hours. In addition, several pro fessions made changes to their testing process by either going back to having fixed exam dates due to national security issues , while others broadened the availability of their exam by offering their exam daily. The Examination Branch worked closely with the testing organizations, the applicants, and the affected PVL st aff such as its Executive Officers and its Licensing Branch , to ensure the transitions were as smooth and seamless as possible. The Examination Branch continued to work with the national board associations and the testing agencies regarding requests from applicants for special testing accommodations. Requests were handled in a timely and professional manner. The Examination Branch also streamlined internal processing procedures for greater efficiency by reviewing and re- assessing the necessity of certain forms, logs, and filing systems. The Licensing Branch was able to continue t he timely processing of new licenses and was able to attain an 88 % on -time processing of renewed licenses even with the continued staff shortage in the Records Section. In addition, the time -frame for processing verifications requests went from approximately 4 weeks to 2 weeks. This improvement in timeliness has decreased the amount of calls pertaining to verific ation requests that are received. The processing time of the mail out of the pocket ID cards and the wall 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 72 - certificates have also improved and, in turn, have resulted in a reduction of inquiries regarding the status of these items. In line with PVL's obj ectives of improving and expanding the division's online services, the Real Estate Branch (REB) continued with its implementation of online services, including condominium association registration and a continuing education (CE) system which provided rea l estate licensees the ability to view the number of CE hours required and earned for the current licensing period, their CE history, and the ability to search for future CE courses being offered by approved CE providers. Real estate licensees may also access and print their own course completion certificates for the current and previous bienniums, whereas in the past this was done by the CE providers. Additionally, real estate principal brokers and brokers -in-charge may monitor and view the current CE hour s, CE history, and license status of all licensees associated with the brokerage. The system is updated daily and is simple to use . Information may be found at http://hawaii.gov/dcca/real/ce_online. The REB/REC, with participation from industry representatives, continued its review and study of the potential impact of mandatory criminal history and background checks for licensure and renewal. Further, through a working relationship with industry groups, the number of CE hours licensees must complete to keep their real estate licenses on an active status were increased from 10 to 20 hours.

Significant Division Activity PVL continue s to make progress in its scanning and imaging project that converts existing licensing document files into electronic format. The conversion of the documents into electronic format protects and preserves historical documentation from damage or destruction. The conversion also has allowed staff to retrieve and review documents in a more expeditious manner , at their desk s, thereby eliminating the time delay that comes with physically pulling files. This subsequently provides for more effective and timely service to our clients. However, even with the scanning of files, the hardcopy file is still sometimes 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 74 - required. Thus, PVL has started a massive project of reorganizing its licensee files into a more efficient and logical filing sy stem. Currently, more than half of the entire population of files has been reorganized. In addition to the scanning of license files, the Licensing Branch is also making greater use of technology as a means to access and store/maintain documents that are high in volume. Some of our high -volume documents that previously needed to be searched for manually can now be accessed and retrieved electronically on a shared drive so multiple staff can access these documents from his/her workstation. Financial Overview The CRF financi al summary relating to PVL for FY 10- 11 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $3,323,905 $850,334 $4,174,239 $4,434,382 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (Action Plan) for FY 2012 PVL will continue to be fiscally co nscious and will continue to protect its special fund so that it remains solvent to provide accurate, efficient, and timely services. PVL will continue to look for ways to enhance and improve its online systems for renewals, License Searches, List Builder, and PVL's webpage to be more user friendly and informative. PVL will continue to convert its downloadable application forms to online fillable application forms. This is a very tedious project and attention to detail is of utmost importance. There a re more than 100 application forms that will be converted. PVL will continue the design phase for a new online surety system that will allow insurance companies the ability to submit liability and worker 's compensation insurance updates for contractor and pest control licensees. This has been a difficult project to move forward due to the complexity of designing a system that in the front end, will verify the surety is licensed to do business in this State and is authorized to write these lines of insurance. Integration with the DCCA Insurance Division license provider database appears to provide a solution. Also, dedication of resources to this project has been strained because of the need to attend to other online priorities. The staff of DAGS/ICSD, w ho are critical to the design and subsequent development phase, face similar strain on their resources and the likelihood of reduced staffing. We remain committed, however, to moving forward with this project. PVL will be upgrading its licensing databas e system (ALIAS) to an updated compliant version by purchasing services and necessary software. ALIAS is relied upon to process license applications, renewals, and change transactions received via walk -in, mail, or over the web. It can also be used to do online PVL license searches for those who want information on licensees . PVL will begin to post of all of its Board and Commission meeting minutes on its respective websites. While only the Real Estate Commission posts its meeting minutes on its website, we decided that the posting of all of the meeting minutes will be very beneficial to and easily accessible by the consuming public. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 75 - PVL will continue the scanning and imaging of licensee files so that new documents for a curr ent licensee file are added as new licensee files are scanned , and will continue the reorganization of the hardcopy files. PVL will also be exploring avenues to streamline the Licensing Branch and the Examination Branch functions and services for improved operational efficiency. P VL will be addressing the information that is made available to the public for thoroughness and clarity in an effort to decrease the amount of inquiries that are generated. PVL will also be reviewing the timeframes for the various steps in the licensure p rocess to ensure greater accountability and consistency in staff performance. The Real Estate Branch will continue to improve the offering and delivery of real estate pre- licensing and continuing education courses to stay in line with the increase in C E hours. REB will begin to offer all real estate licensing applications in a PDF form -fillable format for easy online completion and printing. Rule making will be continued for Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) Chapter 99 for real estate brokers and sale spersons, Chapter 53 for fees relating to boards and commissions, and Hawaii Revised Statutes 514B. REB has collected data, worked with industry members, and is currently drafting proposed HAR Chapter 99 amendments. For the condominium program, REB solic ited and collected suggestions from stakeholders in the condominium community, and is currently compiling and drafting proposed rule amendments for HRS 514B and HAR Chapter 53. REB will further work to enhance online public access to condominium projects and AOUO registrations. The Program of Work for the Real Estate Commission and the REB also includes the development and implementation of a new registration program for condominium projects. For a comprehensive report on the FY 2012 goals and objectives of the Real Estate Branch and the Real Estate Commission, please refer to http://hawaii.gov/dcca/real/main/reports to view their Annual Report for fiscal year ending June 30, 2011. PVL will also pursue several rule amendment initiatives through the formal rule adoption process including amendments to HAR Chapter 53, relating to Fees; amendments to Chapter 71, relating to Certified Public Accountants and Public Accountants, amendments to HAR Chapt er 99, relating to Real Estate Brokers and Salespersons; and proposed new rules for Mixed Martial Arts Contests and Respiratory Therapists. Finally, we are also hopeful we will be able to fill the remaining vacancies PVL has in the Records Section of the Licensing Branch so that the division can sustain its processing time for renewals at prior levels in the middle to high ninetieth percentile without the need for staff overtime. The Applications Section will continue as well, to strive to attain a higher processing time percentile for new licenses. CONCLUSION PVL continues to move ahead with its initiatives to improve accessibility to licensing services and information, and to streamline the licensing process without compromising consumer protection. P VL is committed to working with licensees and the public to achieve the optimum balance between thoughtful and fair regulat ion, and consumer protection. PVL is mindful of the strain on Hawaii's businesses and seeks to integrate licensing measures and procedures that will facilitate business. Ultimately, PVL's objective is to achieve and facilitate a fair mark etplace for the State of Hawaii. The PVL staff and the regulatory licensing boards of PVL continue to maintain high performance standards, uphold c onsumer protection, work well as a team, and be responsive to increased demands. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 76 - Table 1: PVL Statistical Overview FY 09 -10 FY 10 -11 No. of applications received 11,568 11,757 No. of applicants licensed 9,788 9,221 No. of licenses renewe d 62,096 68,418 No. of changes processed 203,365 215,738 No. of calls received by Licensing Branch 88,978 85,026 No. of current licensees 131,816 132,948 Total licensee population (all statuses - i.e. Current, forfeited, delinquent) 335,2 10 347,283 Table 2: Total Number of Current PVL Licensees Boards and Commissions (shown by asterisk *), and Programs FY 09 -10 FY Shops 178 186 Beauty Operator* 7,789 8,423 Beauty Instructor 87 98 Beauty School 11 12 Beauty Shops 1,174 1,295 Boxing (all categories)* 100 34 Cemeteries and Pre -Need Funeral Authorities 30 22 Chiropractors* Elevator Mechanics* 220 223 Employment Agencies 84 68 Engineers, Architects, Surveyors, and Landscape Architects:* Engineers 5,497 5,977 Architects 2,164 2,310 Surveyors 204 211 Landscape Architects 152 159 Hearing Aid Dealers & Fitters 110 117 Marriage and Family Therapists 224 257 Massage Therapists* 7,603 7,436 Massage Establishments 845 788 8,599 Podiatrists 72 75 Osteo paths 717 741 Physician Assistants 176 235 Emergency Medical Technicians 561 671 Mobile Intensive Care Technicians 434 456 Mental Health Counselors 208 236 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 77 - Mixed Martial Arts 192 Mortgage Brokers ** 346 0 Mortgage Broker Bra nch Offices ** 71 0 Mortgage Solicitors ** 1,855 0 Motor Vehicle Dealers* 286 257 Motor Vehicle Salespersons 1,522 1,429 Motor Vehicle Dealers* 812 859 Motor Vehicle Mechanics 1,852 1,955 Naturopaths* 106 127 Nursing* Nurses Registered Nurse (APRN) 957 1,047 APRN with Prescriptive Authority 211 278 Nurse Aides 7,340 7,770 Nursing Home Administrators 144 139 Occupational Therapists 605 557 Optometrists* 377 395 Pest Control Operators* 193 185 Pest Control Field Representatives 243 219 Pharmacists* 2,028 2,182 Pharmacies 244 254 Wholesale Prescription Drug Distributors 58 65 Miscellaneous Permit 312 342 Physical Therapists* 1,394 825 Port Pilots 10 10 Private Detective Agencies* 38 41 Private Detectives 112 113 Guard Agencies 79 79 Guards 99 101 Psychologists* 898 944 Real Estate Appraisers 547 594 6,484 6,207 Real Estate Salespersons 13,319 11,358 Real Estate Branch Offices 92 69 Condominium Hotel Operators 26 26 Social Workers 2,719 1,660 Speech Pathologists* 507 584 Audiologists 63 71 Trav el Agencies 1,213 1,310 Uniform Athlete Agents 2 5 Veterinarians* 428 444 TOTAL 132,565 131,897 ** Licensing and regulatory oversight transferred to the Division of Financial Institutions pursuant to Act 32, Special Session Laws of Hawaii 2010 Table 3: Total Number and (Percentage) of Licenses Renewed Online License Types FY 07 -08 FY 08 -09 Shop 87 (52.1%) 96 (58.5%) 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Professional and Vocational Licensing Division (PVL) - 78 - Beauty Operator 4,198 (64.2%) 4,832 (71.5%) Beauty Instructor 62 (91.2%) 61 (82.4%) S hop 599 (63.3%) 665 Elevator Mechanic 128 (72.32%) 161 (81.3%) Emergency Medical Technician (basic) 414 (90.2%) 462 (86%) Emergency Medical Technician (paramedic) 319 (83.7%) 353 (86.5%) Guard 44 (62.9%) Guard Agency 35 (67%) Hearing Aid Dealer and Fitter 70 (84.3%) 86 (85.1%) Landscape Architect 135 (94.41%) 142 (97.9%) Land Surveyor 180 (96.77%) 193 (97.5%) Marriage and Family Therapist 120 (83.9%) 192 (86.1%) Massage Health Counselor 133 (88.67%) 197 (92.92%) Mortgage Branch Office 38 (74.51%) Mortgage Broker 355 (89.42%) Mortgage Solicitor 1,840 (89.41%) Motor Vehicle Auction 2 (66.67%) 4 (80%) Motor Vehicle Broker 1 (100%) 1 (100%) Motor Vehicle Branch 30 (85.71%) 27 (87%) Motor Vehicle Consumer Consultant 5 (71.43%) 4 (80%) Motor Vehicle Dealer 150 (73.89%) 175 Vehicle (48.94%) Naturopath 71 (81.54%) 418 ol Field Representative 123 (86.62%) 146 (84.9%) Pest Control Operator (inactive Misc.

As the enforcement arm of the Department's professional and vocational licensing boards, comm issions and programs, RICO handles complaints, investigations and prosecutions of over forty -seven (47) different professions and vocations. In addition, the office administers the state's State Certified Arbitration Program, commonly referred to as \"lemo n law\" by providing an arbitration forum for consumers with warranty -related disputes with motor vehicle manufacturers. RICO's main office is located on Oahu at the Leiopapa A Kamehameha Building (State Office Tower) , 235 South Beretania Street ( 8th and 9th Floors ), Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. The division operates four neighbor island offices at Hilo, Kona, Wailuku and Lihue. RICO 's functions can be divided into two main categories: (1) education, information, complaint intake and alternative dispute res olution functions which are performed by the division's Consumer Resource Center, and (2) investigation and prosecution functions for the licensing boards, commissions and programs within the Department's Professional and Vocational Licensing Division whic h are performed by the division's field investigation and legal branches. 10 RICO staff consists of intake investigators, field investigators, attorneys and support staff. Approximately one -fifth of RICO's full -time positions are located in the four neighbor island offices. The primary functions of the RICO branches are generally described as follows: Consumer Resource Center (Education, Information, and Intake) The Consumer Resource Center (\"CRC\") handles all intake functions for RICO and the Office of Consumer Protection (\"OCP\"). With the easy to remember 587 -3222 telephone number, CRC provides an efficient means for the public to obtain consumer information, make complaint -related inquiries and submit formal complaints. Information and assistance to the public is available through telephone, facsimile and walk in contact, and through the RICO website at www.hawaii.gov/dcca/rico . CRC investig ators answer questions and educat e the public about government al services, RICO's and OCP's jurisdictional areas, and RICO's and OCP's complaint processes. CRC staff also conducts p reliminary investigations of RICO complaints and forwards only those cases appropriate for further investigations or prosecution to t he other sections of RICO . Consumer -initiated complaints comprise the majority of RICO's cases. Upon receipt of a complaint, CRC will determine whether an actionable violation is involved. If so, the complaint is handled through mediation, further investi gation or prosecution, or other resolution. 10 See , Section 26 -9, Hawaii Revised Statutes. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 82 - Another important aspect of CRC's work is the service provided by CRC's Licensing & Business Information Section (LBIS). The LBIS is a consolidated service operated by RICO for the Office of Consumer Protection, the Business Registration Division, the Professional and Vocational Licensing Division, and RICO . The service allows callers to use just one telephone number (587- 3222) to find out (1) basic business registration information; (2) whether a business hol ds a professional license; and (3) complaints history on file with RICO and OCP. Through LBIS' service, callers are able to gather important information about a particular licensee or business without having to call multiple state offices. Public access to complaints information has been significantly enhanced with the availability of the interactive Business and Licensee Complaints History search site at www.businesscheck.hawaii.gov. Consumers and businesses now have 24- hour access to current informati on about an individual's or business' complaints history. The site provides information about complaints that were filed as well as administrative or civil legal actions that were taken. The site is widely used by consumers, businesses, licensees, and cr edentialing organizations in Hawaii, as well as in other states, and is designed to provide the inquirer with a printable complaints history report. See Table 1 for more specific information about the Consumer Resource Center. Field Investigation Branc h The Investigation Branch , consisting of field investigators and clerical support staff, contains the largest concentration of RICO personnel statewide. With enforcement responsibility over the licensing laws of 46 different boards, commissions and programs, investigators evaluate a wide range of licensing violations within a diverse population of licensees . See Table 2 for an overview of the number of cases by board, commission or program. In addition, both CRC and F ield staff investigate many tips, anonymous reports and other complaints from consumers, businesses and other interested parties. Field investigators are responsible for gathering evidence in RICO cases to determine whether licensing law violations have occurred. RICO's investigators also take an active part in resolving cases, and in issuing admini strative citations where unlicensed activity is observed. In many cases, field investigators will seek an independent evaluation of the case by an appointed member of a board's advisory comm ittee. Advisory committee members provide opinions about the particular practice being investigated and are helpful in determining industry standards. Once the field investigator has gathered the evidence in a particular case, the case may be referred to the Legal Section for evaluation and disposition. In addition to handling RICO complaints, the neighbor island offices within RICO's investigative section serve as liaison for the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. This responsibility require s the neighbor island staff members to know a little bit about everything concerning the department. As illustrated in Table 3, neighbor island RICO offices provide the most information in areas concerning the Professional and Vocational Licensing Division and the Business Registration Division. Neighbor island staff provides information, forms, educational brochures, technical assistance for hearings, and assistance in the facilitation of professional and voca tional licensing examinations. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 83 - Legal Branc h The Legal Branch has the principal responsibility of taking disciplinary or civil action against violators of the statutes and rules within RIC O's jurisdiction. Upon receipt of a case, the Legal Branch will determine the appropriate course of action based upon the informa tion contained in the investigative file. Formal action may be taken by either the filing of a Petition for Disciplinary Action with the Office of Administrative Hearings (for cases involving licensees), a hearing related to the issu ance of a citation, or a Complaint for Injunctive and Other Relief in circuit court (for cases involving unlicensed activity) . State Certified Arbitration Program The State Certified Arbitration Program (SCAP), more commonly known as the lemon law progra m, provides an arbitration forum for a consumer to resolve a warranty -related dispute with a motor vehicle manufacturer witho ut having to hire an attorney. RICO's Legal Branch handles t he administration of SCAP. Staff is actively involved in arbitrator training and in overseeing the actual arbitrations, and provides educational information to the public about the lemon law and the arbitration process. The SCAP administrator is also actively involved in representing Hawaii in the International Association of Lemon Law Administrators. See Table 4 for more specific information about SCAP case outcomes. GOALS, OBJECTIVES & POLICIES RICO has three main operational goals: to uphold a fair and safe marketplace, to provide excellent customer service, and to optim ize operational efficiency. In upholding a fair and safe marketplace, RICO activities are directed toward a ddress ing license violations and complaints and inquiries through appropriate referral, investigation, resolution and/or prosecution and towar d making regulation more effective. The division is doing this proactively through sweeps, stings and compliance checks. The division gauges performance by, among other things, the number of enforcement actions it brings and the number it completes. In providing excellent customer service, RICO activities are directed toward e nabling members of the public to become knowledgeable participants in transactions w ith licensed professionals, fostering an awareness of the importance of licensure, and providing meaningful assistance and support to the public in a user-friendly manner. The division is doing this through participation in relevant consumer fairs and shows, especially on the neighbor islands, and through providing additional information available online. The division gauges performance by, among other things, the amount of consumer outreach conducted (educational, fairs, neighbor island assistance, speaking engagements and telephone assistance). In optimizing operational efficiency, RICO activities are directed toward promot ing internal case handling systems and related tools and systems that aid in fair, timely and effective enforcement, and enabling (train ing) and assist ing staff in fulfilling RICO objectives and policies. The division is doing this through training for staff, adequate staffing, database enhancements, and streamlined report writing. The division evaluates performance by monitoring the amount of time a case is handled by each branch. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 84 - ACCOMPLISHMENTS Enforcement Prosecutions : The following table summarizes RICO legal actions for the 2010- 2011 fiscal year: RICO Proceedings Filed FY11 Petitions for Disciplinary Action 83 Settlement Agreement and Order 76 Citations (Unlicensed Activity) 51 Complaints (Unlicensed Activity ) 43 Consent Judgments (Unlicensed Activity) 45 Assurance of Voluntary Compliance 10 Miscellaneous/Special Proceedings 8 Total 316 RICO Proceedings Outcomes FY11 Board Orders (total) 186 Revocation Orders 64 Suspension Ord ers 7 Assurance of Voluntary Compliance 11 Unlicensed Activity Judgments and Orders 128 Fines Assessed $1,040,733 Restitution Assessed $319,877 Total Proceeding Outcomes 325 Legislation : Act 121 (2010), Relating to Construction Sites. The Act required the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs to convene a Task Force to analyze the feasibility and potential complications of investigating and inspecting construction sites for unlicensed contractors, undocumented workers and workplace sa fety violations. The Task Force timely submitted its report to the Legislature in November 2010 and made a number of recommendations designed to facilitate collaborative enforcement in matters involving unlicensed contractors. House Concurrent Resolution 286, House Draft 1 (2011), Relating to Unlicensed Contractor Law Enforcement. As a follow up to the work of the 2010 Task Force, the Legislature in 2011 requested that the Director of DCCA establish a task force to develop a collaborative enforcement, wi th a specific emphasis on information sharing and criminal law enforcement. This Task Force has been meeting in fiscal year 2012 and is expected to submit its findings and recommendations to the Legislature prior to the 2012 session. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 85 - Consumer and Licens ee Outreach : RICO continues to work with the building industry to provide contracting law information to consumers as part of a series of B uilding Industry Association presentations about remodeling issues and has participated in a number of home shows and industry group presentation s. At the same time, in response to questions from the public, RICO prepared and placed online detailed tips on what information to provide when reporting unlicensed activity and has placed its Quarterly List of Unlicensed Ac tivity Judgments online. In addition, RICO's website now includes a link to the Department's monthly press release of professional disciplinary orders and a detailed explanation of its complaints handling process. The CRF financial summary relating to R ICO for FY 10-11 is as follows: Personnel Expenses Operating Expenses Total Expenses Revenues Received $3,978,584 $559,688 $4,538,272 $5,666,784 CONCLUSION With responsibility for the enforcement of the licensing laws of over 46 boards, commissions and programs, RICO continues to receive a large number of inquiries, complaints and other requests for assistance. Rapid changes and increased complexity in the way many of the licensed professionals conduct business, as well as changes in state law have spawned new enforcement issues and new challenges for RICO. Through strategic initiatives, enhanced training, and a commitment to continual improvement, the division will continue its efforts to provide a fair and safe marketplace for the consumers, businesses and professionals it serves . 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 86 - Table 1: RICO Consumer Resource Center 2009 2010 2011 Telephone Requests for Complaints History , License Status and Business Registration 54,950 59,423 53,025 Complaint Inquiries & 15,797 TOTAL 65,866 With RICO 2009FY 2010FY 2011FY Accountants 5 11 8 Activity Desks 21 37 2 Acupuncturists 4 0 0 Barbers & Cosmetologists 44 46 66 Boxing 1 2 0 Cemeteries and Pre- Need Funeral Authorities 3 4 5 Chiropractors 3 2 7 Collection Agencies 23 10 12 Contractors 397 363 363 Dentists and Dental Hygienists 18 21 16 Dispensing Opticians 2 2 6 Electricians & Plumbers 21 28 31 Electrologists 0 0 0 Elevator Mechanics 0 0 0 Employment Age ncies 0 0 0 Engineers, Architects, Surveyors and Landscape Architects 26 17 31 Hearing Aid Dealers & Fitters 0 2 0 Marriage and Family Therapists 0 0 0 Massage Therapists 72 60 78 Medical (including Osteopathy) 80 49 53 Mental Health Counselors 0 0 0 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 87 - 2009FY 2010FY 2011FY Mortgage Brokers & Solicitors 24 21 27 Motor Vehicle Industry 47 33 55 Motor Vehicle Repair 51 44 37 Naturopaths 4 1 1 Nursing 30 30 32 Nursing Home Administrators 1 2 1 Occupational Therapist 0 0 1 Optometrists 3 0 2 Pest Control 4 5 7 Pharmacy 15 42 18 Physical Therapists 2 2 2 Pilotage 0 0 0 Private Detectives & Guards 1 6 12 Psychologists 8 9 5 Real Estate Appraisers 4 4 10 Real Estate (including Condominiums) 181 180 159 Respiratory Therapists (effective 7/ 1/2011) -- 0 0 Social Workers 8 3 2 Speech Pathologists & Audiologists 0 1 0 Subdivision 0 0 0 Time Share 18 4 3 Travel Agencies 89 6 9 No Rules Combat (Chapter 440D repealed and replaced by Chapter 440E (Mixed Martial Arts, 7/1/2009) 33** 0 1 Uniform Athlete Agents (effective 7/1/08) 0 0 0 Veterinarians 7 2 4 1,244* 1,049* 1,068* *Does not include investigations closed or referred at intake level. **Includes compliance checks. 2011 Compliance Resolution Fund Report Regulated Industries Complaints Office (RICO) - 88 - Table 3: Assistance b y Neighbor Island RICO Offices in FY 2011 AGENCY HILO KAUAI KONA MAUI TOTAL Division of Financial Institutions 17 0 17 1 35 Business Registration 448 552 722 197 1,919 Cable Television 2 0 0 0 2 Insurance Division 48 11 74 3 136 Division of Consumer Advocacy 28 16 26 0 70 Professiona l & Vocational Licensing 470 310 742 321 1,843 Office of Consumer Protection 224 355 189 233 1,001 Non-Department Related 343 658 459 142 1,602 Totals 1,580 1,902 2,229 897 6,608 Table 4: RICO State Certified Arbitration Program (\"SCAP\") Activity TOTAL NO.
