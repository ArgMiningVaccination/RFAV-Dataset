In the current climate of psychological, social and economic changes, the trend is influenced by explosive knowledge creation and exponential technology growth. Thus, the need to modify and infuse changes in the English Curriculum at the +2 level is a necessary step in the upgradation and updation of the earlier English curriculum. The aim is to bring it at par with other academic, competency and skills-based disciplines, in its rigor and content. It should be borne in mind that the methodology used in the classroom will be automatically followed by some alterations in the language teaching and learning process. The increasing use of audio- visual aids and the internet also impacts our objectives to give our learners greater autonomy in their learning, enabling differentiate instruction, and, its transformational impact on teaching methods and deployment of assessment tools, consistent with those objectives. At the + 2 stage, students begin to contemplate and introspect on their choice of subjects for higher study, and the mastery of the language forms the foundation for their higher education. They may choose advanced, specialized courses-including English Language & Literature, among courses offered in leading universities in India and abroad. At the later stages of their academic tenure, students' levels of competency can also notably influence their career path. The English Elective CBSE course has four major components. 1. The Literature Reader which is divided into three parts: prose, poetry and drama. Leading writers in English, from India, UK, Australia, Canada etc.,have brought in a range of styles which infuse variety, along with a range of values-based themes that can be easily understood and appreciated by the age group. The learning experiences offered through the activities are exhaustive as they cover literary appreciation, along with the development of the four language skills. 2. The Novels : Inculcating habits of extensive and independent reading among youth has always been a concern for all stakeholders. The two prescribed novels serve the purpose of creating independent individuals with the ability to not only create their own knowledge, but also critically interpret, analyse and evaluate it with objectivity and fairness. This will also help students in learning and acquiring greater proficiency in the language and higher level of skills in language use. Sample questions are provided at the end of the book as practice materials that are broadly reflective of the typology. 3. The Language Skills Book is a value added feature of the class XII English curriculum, and is based on a set of five themes, which students can relate to. The units offer a wide range of sub- themes and skills -based activities that will equip students to introspect, research, analyse and evaluate knowledge content independently, extend and apply such knowledge and skills in a number of academic and professional contexts. Sample questions are provided at the end of the book as practice materials that are broadly reflective of the typology. By the end of the course, students will read, write and use grammar structures and a wider set of vocabulary effectively and, learn to speak and listen efficiently. 4. Speaking and Listening Skills : Speaking and listening skills need a very strong emphasis and is an important objective leading to academic and professional competence. To this end, speaking and listening skills are overtly built into the material, namely, the workbook, to guide teachers in the actualization of the skills. As good communication skills raise the self-esteem and give a student confidence to face the challenges of life, it is desired that the student acquires proficiency in it by the time he or she completes school education The teachers handling the course need to inform themselves regarding the effective use of course content, teaching methodology, lesson planning, deployment of electronic technology for teaching, management of group work and independent individual work, managing large classes, appropriate use of assessment tools and, grading and record keeping to benefit their students. The seamless integration of the language skills will provide students more focused language skills necessary for their successful upward mobility academically and professionally, as a result of their higher standard of English proficiency. This will enhance the total Learning Experience of our students who will be the unequivocal beneficiaries of the most life-long and significant transferable job skill that supports the achievement of their life goals, as confident and competent communicators in English.

According to the Cricket Legend Sunil Gavaskar , success in any vocation requires three Ds: (1) discipline, which is more mental than physical; (2) dedication to hours of practice; and (3) determination. At the Wharton India Economic Forum in Philadelphia, Gavaskar spoke with India Knowledge@Wharton about his career , how the business side of cricket has changed over the years, and what he has learned about teamwork and leadership along the way. Read the excerpt from the original interview . India Knowledge@Wharton: Well, let us start with a very basic question. How did you get interested in cricket? Was it because of your uncle, Madhav Mantri? Sunil Gavask ar: Yes, that was a factor . When you have somebody in your family playing cricket at the highest level, then automatically you do get interested, but I would imagine that a lot of boys in Mumbai would take to cricket simply because cricket is the sport in Mumbai - like hockey in Punjab and maybe football, or soccer , in Kolkata, Goa and Kerala. India Knowledge@Wharton: I do remember one of your records was that you scored 34 centuries in test cricket, and that record was not broken for more than 20 years. In order to have that kind of achievement, what kind of qualities and attributes do you need to cultivate within yourself? Gavask ar: I think focus, determination and a fair amount of discipline - which is not the kind of discipline that is normally associated with having an early night, going to sleep at 10 o'clock and waking up at six. That kind of discipline is important as well, but the discipline to mould your game according to the needs of the situation - you need that kind of discipline. I would imagine that any vocation, any profession the three Ds that I believed in - discipline, dedication and determination. India Knowledge@Wharton: So, explain how you did that in the case of developing your own ability in the cricket? Gavask ar: Well, for example, as far as dedication was concerned, I would practice a lot. I would practice say, three hours in the morning, then go to school, then after school again practice for another two and a half, three hours. You needed to balance your studies, your education, along with the practice hours, simply because at the time during which I played, cricket was not a career option. It has become a very, very good career option now with the kind of money that has come into the sport. So, you had to balance your studies as well as your cricket, your love for the game, which meant that you had to show dedication to practice the discipline to be able to go back to your books and to study . And to be able to do that at an early age, went a long way in helping me in my cricketing career . India Knowledge@Wharton: And how do those attributes translate over from cricket to, say, business life? Gavask ar: It is pretty much the same, in the sense that in business, you have to try and study what the situation is, study the opponent.... I would imagine that there has to be a bit of study , there has to be a lot of hard work involved, and you have to do a lot of preparation.77In cricket, for example, when you are batting and you know what the opposition bowling is going to be like, and you know what the pitch is likely to be and then you decide the range of your shots. And I would imagine that is the same thing that you would want to do in business: have ambitions - definitely have ambitions - start slowly , and as you settle in, as you start to get the hang of business, then you try and expand.... India Knowledge@Wharton: Did you take a lot of risks in the way you played cricket? Gavask ar: No, I do not think so because I was an opening batsman and we were brought up to eschew all risks to be able to play a risk-free cricket as much as possible and tire the bowlers out, so then the batsman coming down, the glamour boys, as they call them. We were the plodders, you know, who did all the hard work - paved the road, as you can say, for the guys. We walked the road so that the others could drive a car on it. India Knowledge@Wharton: The other thing that fascinates me about cricket is the fact that it's a team sport. What kind of lessons in teamwork did your years in cricket teach you? Gavask ar: Well, first and foremost, as a batsman you cannot score runs, or cannot score a century , unless you have somebody batting at the other end for you, unless you have somebody who is taking the runs for you. Unless you have the confidence of somebody staying with you at the other end, you cannot get to a century . So, that is number one. The other thing is that there will come a time, even during that innings when you are batting well, when the bowler is bowling so well that you might actually be better off being at the non- striker's end; and if you have a striker who is good enough to take on the load at that stage, then it helps you to tire that bowler out and maybe go on to get a 100. Also, if you are a bowler , then you need the fielders to be able to take the catches, to be able to stop the runs being taken for you to take the wickets. So, it is in a sense a lot of teamwork. It also, in a way, reflects on how [well] you can possibly do in society , in the sense that the more talented batsman always looks after the lesser talented batsman in terms of trying to take more of the strike from a dangerous bowler . He is trying to take more of the strike, and maybe he will bat five balls out of the six-ball over, and maybe just give one ball to the lesser talented batsman. So, you are looking after somebody slightly less talented, and I think that is probably what you want to do in society - that if you are [doing] well enough, you are trying to look after the less fortunate. It is a bit of teamwork. India Knowledge@Wharton: As a result of your success as a player , you also became the captain of the team. What kind of leadership lessons did that teach you? Gavask ar: Well, I was fortunate to have been playing under some very, very fine captains from the Ranji T rophy level - the state level to the international level - and you tended to sort of observe them, to pickup points from them. If, for example, to pass a message across - a stern message.88So, Ajit Wadekar , who was my captain, would pass the message on by scolding the Mumbai guys, even if the Mumbai guys had done nothing. But it was his way of passing on a message to the others \"to not do this; as a captain, I do not want that.\" On the other hand, you had somebody like Tiger Pataudi, who was captain who pretty much let you do what you wanted. He believed in your abilities. So, he was not a guy with a hand on your shoulder . He would sort of let you run ... and if you made a mistake and if you came to him, then he was very happy to talk to you about it. India Knowledge@Wharton: Last year at the Wharton India Economic Forum, we were fortunate to interview President APJ Abdul Kalam, and he mentioned that one of the most important qualities of a leader is to learn how to manage failure. I was wondering whether you learned any lessons from that time of your company which have stayed with you over the years? Gavask ar: Yes, I think the main thing that you learn is never to lose heart - that it is a cycle. Sometimes, the opposition is simply better than you, and you have to give credit to the fact that they might have just played better than you. Then you try and analyze how you could have improved or bettered your performance, how you could have been more competitive, and when you do that, you tend to be able to find out where you went wrong. One of the best [pieces of] advice that I ever received was from a former captain, who said to me that you must keep a diary of the days when you do well, when you bat well. His reasoning was very simple. When you, for example, took stance to bat, how did you feel? Obviously , it was not always easy to remember every little thing or every single thing. He said when you are going through a bad patch that is the time you read back on the day that you had scored well, and on the day that you had batted well, because that will then give you a fair comparison as to what you had been doing then, and maybe you should try and replicate that. Also, when you are reading [about] when you have batted well, you start believing in yourself. You might not be getting any runs at all, but just reading about the good days when you did that will boost your confidence, and I thought that was fantastic advice.... It absolutely works. India Knowledge@Wharton: You mentioned the fact that today , cricket is a career option, especially with the 20-20 and the formation of the IPL. How has the business side of the game changed, and do you think it has changed for the better or are there things that bother you? Gavask ar: I think there are more pluses than minuses. Obviously , in any sport there will always be certain minuses, but I believe that with the advent of the Indian Premier League, the kind of money that is in the game now certainly is a big plus, because it has encouraged parents who were all the time pushing their talented kids only into education simply because they wanted a degree behind them so they would be able to get a decent job. Now, if they see that their kid has talent, they will say, \"Okay , go and play, because there is no age limit for education, but there is age limit for sports.\" That is what I told my son, Rohan, as well - that when he was starting to play, you play as much as you want; do not worry about anything else, because you can always study once you have finished with the game....99India Knowledge@Wharton: What is the biggest leadership challenge you have faced? Gavask ar: Well, the biggest challenge is to be able to get the rest of the team to believe in itself, and I think it probably has something to do with the fact that we have had a system in our country - call it the caste system or the class system - whereby some people believe that they are not as good as others. To be able to make them believe in their ability - that their ability is what matters, not the class, not the caste that they come from. I think that has been the biggest challenge. India Knowledge@Wharton: One last question. How do you define success? Gavask ar: I would imagine that it is a feeling of satisfaction when you have done your job and the feeling of giving it your best, giving it everything, and to be able to put your head on the pillow and sleep peacefully , knowing that you have given it everything. At the end of the day, then, success and failure - as the world terms it - is in the hands of God, but the effort is in your hands. 3.

A panel discussion on the commercialisation of sports Today, one can earn well as a sportsperson. It's not only about playing the sport, but also endorsing products, making guest appearances, writing for magazines and newspapers. Here are a few questions that can help the discussion. Have you bought a product just because your sports hero is its brand ambassador? Why? Would you like to see more of your sports stars endorsing products? Give reasons. Do you think, if such celebrities endorse a social cause such as blood donation, no smoking, paying taxes, protection of endangered wild life etc., it would have a better Games and Glory READING 1. (a) The history of the World Cup Trophy . 1. It stands 36.8 centimetres high, weighs 6.1 kilograms, is made of solid, 18-carat gold \u2014 and it's one of the most sought-after prizes in all of sports. It's the FIFA World Cup Trophy . 2. First awarded in 1930 at the inaugural World Cup in Uruguay , the trophy has been on a wild ride in the 80 years since, travelling the world many times over and visiting almost every country on the planet. It's important to know that the current World Cup trophy is the second incarnation of soccer's greatest prize. 3. The original statuette, named Victory , stood 35 centimetres tall and weighed 3.8 kilograms. The octagonal cup, held by a winged figure representing Nike \u2014 the ancient Greek goddess of victory \u2014 was the creation of French sculptor , Abel Lafleur . 4. From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy was awarded to the winner of the World Cup of Football. Originally called \"Victory\", the trophy more commonly known as the 'World Cup' or 'Coupe du Monde' though it was renamed in 1946 after the FIFA president Jules Rimet, who organized the first tournament. This trophy was designed by a French sculptor , Abel Lafleur , as a Goddess of Victory holding an octagonal vessel in her outstretched hands. The trophy was created in gold with a base set on a piece of semi-precious stone. 5. To prevent the Nazis from confiscating the golden Jules Rimet Trophy , Dr. Ottorino Barassi, an Italian sports official, smuggled it from the bank in Rome, and hid it under his bed for most of the war time before the 1950 World Cup. The Jules Rimet World Cup trophy was stolen while on exhibition in London just before kick-off of the 1966 finals. The name of the mongrel dog, who sniffed out the stolen trophy from its hiding place under a garden hedge in Norwood in South London, was called 'Pickles'. His owner , David Corbett, collected a GBP 6,000 reward, and the man who had demanded a GBP15,000 ransom for the return of the trophy , was jailed for two years. 12126. After the Jules Rimet trophy was paraded by the Brazilian players after the 1970 final match, the top of the trophy disappeared. Brazilian Reserve Davio retrieved the valuable gold top from a young spectator at the stadium exit. As a result, the new trophy was designed to have no top! The Jules Rimet trophy was awarded to but not kept by the winning team. The trophy was only permanently awarded if the team became 3-time champions. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently . This particular trophy , however , was stolen in 1983, and the current location of the trophy is unknown. The trophy was stolen from a display box in the headquarters of the Brazilian Football Association in Rio on 20 December 1983, and was probably melted down afterwards. A copy, made by a German goldsmith, was donated to the Brazilian Football Association by Kodak of Brazil. 7. After 1970, a new trophy , known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy , was designed. Constructed in 18-karat solid gold, the trophy is 36 centimeters tall, has two rings in malachite inlaid in the base, and weighs a total of 4,970 grams. The new trophy was designed by Silvio Gazzaniga (and submitted by Bertoni of Milan, Italy). Gazzaniga's design was chosen by FIFA from 53 other trophy models presented. Gazzaniga described his work by saying, \"The lines spring out of the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory .\" The new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently , no matter how many World Cups they win. The original trophy remains in FIFA's possession, while the winning National Association receives a gold-plated replica. A new World Cup trophy will be required for 2042, as the name plaque at base of the current trophy is designed to be filled up by names of the 17 champions from 1974 to 2038.

This article from the Psychology of Extreme Sports by Joachim Vogt Isaksen, discusses what drives extreme sportsmen and sportswomen, towards high-risk behav ior. th 1.On the 14 of October 2012 the Austrian, Felix Baumgartner set the world record for skydiving. The jump was performed from 39 kilometers above the earth, reaching an estimated speed of 1,342 kph. Baumgartner is also famous for the particularly dangerous nature of the stunts he has performed during his career . His latest jump, which was the last in his career , received massive media coverage, and is one of the most spectacular stunts throughout human history . 2.Extreme sport participants are often portrayed in a negative way, for example as being unbalanced, with a need to take unnecessary risks, not caring for family and friends that are left back worrying. However , psychological research indicates that the popular perception of the mad extreme sport participant needs some corrections. This article will present some of the important research that has been done within the field, and will also discuss the motivation that drive people toward taking extreme risks. 3.Who are the people involved in these dangerous activities? Do they display personality traits that are completely different from people who engage in more \"normal\" hobbies? In 2009, researchers Erik Brymer and Lindsay Oades did an interview study of 15 participants of leisure activities as B.A.S.E. jumping (building, antenna, span, earth), big wave surfing, extreme skiing, waterfall kayaking, extreme mountaineering, and solo roe-free climbing. The study explored what can be learned from extreme sports about courage and humility-two positive psychological constructs. One of their main findings were that extreme sport participants directly related their experience to personal transformations that in a postive way, were spilled over to other areas in life. 4.Fear is a normal human emotional reaction; it is a built-in survival mechanism we are all equipped with. This emotion is a response to danger and serves a protective purpose, signaling to us of threats and preparing us to deal with it. From an evolutionary perspective, it seems illogical to take risks that may lead to death when there is no objective goal or anything to achieve from the activity a person displays. On the other hand it is sensible and logical to take risks if it serves the protection of oneself or ones\u00b4 own group from external dangers such as intruders or predators. 5.Extreme sport participants therefore to build down the natural reaction of fear, and go against their natural instincts. Repeated exposure to fearful situations, may lead to familiarity toward the danger , and gradually a more positive emotional response. After continuous exposure to new fearful experiences the fear response is reduced. This leads some people to seek ever new and bigger thrills. 6.At an intellectual level extreme sport participants are of course fully aware that each 1818time they take part in these leisure activities death might be involved. Even if fear is hardwired into our genes, people who seek extreme sports perceive fear as something positive. 7.Despite the fact that evolutionary logic has designed us with mechanisms that prevent us from dangers, our brain is also equipped with reward mechanisms that are activated when we are subjected to extreme experiences. The neuropsychologists have a good understanding of how the reward systems in the brain respond to fear . These are deep structures that involve the nerve signal dopamine which is released in the brain following extreme experiences. The feeling of transformation the people reported in the interviews may stem from the release of this hormone that creates feelings of optimism and happiness. 8.Dopamine plays an important role in the reward- and motivational systems in the brain, and high levels of it leads to feelings of well-being. Therefore one may conclude that the effect of overcoming fear may lead to positive psychological outcomes. The experience of fear induced by risk may be compared to the response people have after surviving dramatic incidents such as serious illness, car accidents or traumas. People often report that these experiences change their lives. Such experiences may in the longer run lead to personal development and increased appreciation of life. 9.Dopamine is the most important nerve signal involved in drug experiences and its effect is desirable and addictive. Extreme experiences may in the same way trigger the reward system and people may feel that they are addicted to the experiences. The brain will not differentiate between the degrees of safety of the activities you perform, whether it is bungee jumping or whether it is the state of being in love. What is important is whether the activity results in the release of the nerve signals involved in the brain\u00b4s reward system. 10.After all, the often negative popular view of the extreme sport participant needs some clarifications. The participants are well-trained with the aim of reducing the risk of the activity . One could assume that it is not the danger in itself that motivates the athletes, but instead it may be an addiction to the biochemical reaction within the brain that leads to the state of joy and well-being. One could therefore look at extreme sport participants as addicts to the body\u00b4s natural drugs. 11.When extreme sport participants stop performing these activities the brain stops producing the drugs that make them feel good. The ultimate goal and motivation behind the activities is the \"natural high\" induced by the release of dopamine, whereas the risks involved might be considered negative side effects. Although, the positive bodily effects are so strong and longed for that they triumph the high risk of serious injury or death. (b)Based on your reading, choose the most appropriate answer .

Relative Clauses (a) Read these sentences from the text. Note the highlighted words. A relative clause is a subordinate clause that begins with a question word, e.g., who, which, where (or the word that). A relative clause modifies a noun or pronoun by providing extra information. Words like who, that and when are often referred to as relative pronouns when they are used to introduce relative clauses. You use: who for people, which for things, and that for both people and things. whom as the object of a relative clause (in more formal English), though it is increasingly common to replace it with who. whose to indicate possession, as a determiner before nouns. (i)A defining relative clause is used to 'identify' or 'restrict the reference of a noun. This is not separated it from the rest of the sentence by commas. The student who does brilliantly will be awarded the Scholarship. The movie that involved fighting and shooting was banned. The house, which is on the top of the hill, is mine. (ii)A non-defining relative clause is used to supply additional information about the noun Albert Einstein, who put forward the theory of relativ ity, is considered to be the most intelligent man. The house, which is on the top of the hill, is mine. You should not use the relative pronoun 'that' in non-defining relative clauses.

ATHLETES ARE WHA T THEY EAT 1. (a) Study the picture. What message does it convey? The Paralympic Games are a major international multi-sport event where athletes with a physical disability compete; this includes athletes with mobility disabilities, amputations, blindness, and cerebral palsy. \"Para\" means \"alongside\" - so \"parallel\" to the Olympic Games. There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which are held immediately following their respective Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).2323READING (b) The First P aralympic Games 1. The Rome 1960 Paralympic Games was a tremendous step in sports for athletes with a physical impairment. The founder of the Paralympic Movement, Sir Ludwig Guttmann, and the Director of the Spinal Centre in R ome, Antonia Maglio, started preparations for the games two years prior . It would be called the 9th Annual International Stoke Mandeville Games. Now regarded as the Rome 1960 Paralympic Games, the competition took place six days following the closing ceremony of the XVII Olympic Games and was supported by the Italian Olympic Committee and the Italian Institute for Disabled Workers (INAIL). A total of eight different sports debuted at the first-ever Paralympic Games, all of which were considered beneficial and suitable for athletes with spinal cord injuries: archery , IPC athletics, dart, snooker , IPC swimming, table tennis, wheelchair fencing, wheelchair basketball. The opening ceremony on 18 September garnered a crowd of 5,000 spectators, which greeted the wheelchair athletes during their colorful entry into Acqua Acetosa Stadium. The Italian Minister for Public Health at the time, officially declared the Games open to the world. In the debut of the Paralympic Games on the world stage, the host nation Italy finished atop the medal standings, as Great Britain, Germany , Austria and USA rounded out the top five with stellar performances. The closing ceremony on 25 September was held in the Palazettodello in the Olympic Village in the presence of Sir Guttmann, the Patron of the Games. Sir Guttmann summed up the Games saying: \"The vast majority of competitors and escorts have fully understood the meaning of the Rome Games as a new pattern of reintegration of the paralyzed into society , as well as the world of sport.\" The opening and closing ceremonies of the London Paralympics 2012 2. In front of a packed Olympic Stadium, British Tour de France winner - and triple Olympic champion - Bradley Wiggins rang the largest harmonically tuned bell in the world to signal the start of the ceremony , which dazzled hundreds of millions of viewers around the world. And in the spectacular finale, seven young torchbearers - each nominated by one of Britain's past Olympic greats - ignited the Olympic Cauldron, which was formed by 204 copper petals, representing the competing nations coming together at the Games. The ceremony had begun with an idyllic countryside setting - representing Britain's \"green and pleasant land\", complete with farm animals and maypole dancers - but the stadium was soon transformed into a gritty industrial landscape as thousands of performers re-enacted the country's industrial revolution to a soundtrack of beating drums. As the scene reached its climax, a giant, glowing ring was 'forged' before being lifted into the air, where it joined with four others to create the Olympic rings, suspended high above the stadium.2424Queen Elizabeth II then made a dramatic entrance - \"parachuting\" into the stadium with fictional secret agent, James Bond, after apparently flying to the stadium in a helicopter from Buckingham Palace. 3. Following the parade of nations, which saw athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees march into the stadium, Queen Elizabeth II officially declared the Games open before all attention moved outside the stadium, where five-time Olympic champion Steve Redgrave received the Olympic Torch from David Beckham and young footballer Jade Bailey , who arrived by speedboat after travelling along the Thames. The group of aspiring sportsmen and women then headed to the centre of the arena, where they each lit one of the 204 copper petals, which are inscribed with the name of one of the competing nations. 4. As the cauldron's long stems rose elegantly from the ground, the petals merged to form one unified flame, which will burn for the duration of the games. During his speech, IOC President, Jacques Rogge, said: \"I congratulate all of the athletes who have earned a place at these Games. And to the athletes, I offer this thought: Your talent, your dedication and commitment brought you here. Now you have a chance to become true Olympians. That honour is determined not by whether you win, but by how you compete. Character counts far more than medals.\" 5. Seb Coe, London 2012 Chairman, said afterwards: \"The athletes competing at the Olympic Games have arrived in London to give the performances of their lives. We wanted to provide a very British welcome for them and the rest of the world. Danny Boyle has created a show of memories and moments that will last a lifetime for people across the UK and the world.\" The London 2012 Closing Ceremony 6. On August 12, the Olympic Stadium - which staged so many impressive sporting achievements during the Games - played host to a kaleidoscopic ceremony that celebrated the best of British music. As the Olympic flag was lowered, President Rogge paid tribute to the London 2012 volunteers, as well as the enthusiastic support that fans offered throughout the Games. \"We will never forget the smiles, the kindness and the support of the wonderful volunteers, the much-needed heroes of these Games,\" he said. 7. \"You, the spectators and the public, provided the soundtrack for these Games. Your enthusiastic cheers energised the competitors and brought a festive spirit to every Olympic venue. You have shown the world the best of British hospitality .\" London 2012 Chairman Seb Coe also thanked the British public for embracing the Games, saying: \"We lit the flame and we lit up the world; we know more now, as individuals and as a nation, just what we are capable of.\" 25258. The Olympic flame was then extinguished, bringing the London 2012 Olympic Games to a close as the band 'The Who' provided a fitting conclusion with their anthem \"My Generation\". \"This may be the end of these two glorious weeks in London,\" said Coe. \"But what we have begun will not stop now. The spirit of these Olympic Games will inspire a generation.\" (c) Fill in the Venn diagr am based on your understanding. 2. WRITING (a) Study the pictures of the paralympic mascot.

He had been roller skating since he was 18 months old, and wanted a new challenge. \"It took three months before I could get my body in the right position,\" he said. \"Since then I have skated under lots of cars and have never hurt myself.\" Aniket said: \"The hardest thing is to go fast enough before I bend down.

UNESCO \u00fd2929(c)Curtail _______________________________________________________ heard of Natalia Partyka but you should have. She has done something which only five other athletes have managed in history - she has competed at both the Paralympic and the Olympic Games. Natalia Partyka is a Polish table tennis player who was born without a right hand and forearm. She started playing table tennis when she was seven years old because she wanted do the same as her older sister . She was motivated to practise hard because her sister was much better ... at first. She obviously learnt her lesson well because she participated for the first time at the Paralympic Games when she was just 11 years old - the youngest athlete at the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. Since then she has competed at two more Paralympic Games, winning two gold and two silver medals. It was in Beijing 2008 that she joined the exclusive club of athletes who have competed at both Games. Beijing was her third Paralympic Games and her first Olympics. So what's the difference between playing at the Paralympics and Olympics? According to Natalia, disabled players have to think more and find ways to win points because many of them can't move so fast. So it can actually be more difficult playing at the Paralympics. Natalia has many good memories, such as the time she beat Li Jia Wei from Singapore, who was then ranked number 8 in the world. However , sometimes, she says, winning isn't the most important thing. Sometimes, Natalia says, the most important thing is losing, because \"you learn a lot from your errors and so become a better player .\" With an attitude like that she will continue to improve and continue to excel. Natalia Partyka is a clearly a name we will be hearing more about in the future. The use of banned performance-enhancing drugs in sports is commonly referred to as doping. This is a major problem for sports governing bodies. This, however , is not a new phenomenon. Drugs have been used to enhance performance since ancient times. Greek and Roman civilisations used mushrooms and herbs to improve their performance. Later in the 19th century substances including alcohol, opium and caffeine were used. The more recent forms of performance enhancing drugs have roots from World War II Listening Script - 01 Listening Script - 023030where certain drugs were used by American soldiers to keep them alert. However , a number of deaths and allegations of drug taking encouraged the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to set up a Medical Commission in 1967 which banned the use of drugs and other performance enhancing substances. Small-scale testing was introduced at the 1968 Mexico Olympics, followed by a full-scale testing at the next games in Munich, 1972. Following a large number of doping offences being committed in the mid-nineties, and the existence of several conflicting organisations, the World Conference on Doping was held in Switzerland in 1999. As a result, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was formed to promote and co-ordinate the fight against drug use in sport on an international level, across all sports. By adopting the Convention on 19 October 2005, UNESCO responded to the calls from the international community . At the Third International Conference of Ministers and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and Sport in December 1999, consideration was given to ethical values in sport. Ministers expressed concern over unethical behavior , in particular doping in sport, and urged all countries to take concerted action. The Convention helps to formalize global anti-doping rules, policies and guidelines in order to provide an honest and equitable playing environment for all athletes. It suggests that the governments are required to take specific action to: Restrict the availability of prohibited substances to athletes Facilitate doping controls and support national testing programmes Withhold financial support from athletes guilty of anti-doping rule violation Encourage labelling, marketing and distribution of products with prohibited substances; Support anti-doping education. Entered into force on 1 February 2007, the convention became the most successful convention in the history of UNESCO. The Convention also provides a mechanism to assist to develop anti-doping education and prevention programmes through the Fund for the Elimination of Doping in Sport managed by UNESCO. \u00fd \u00fd \u00fd \u00fd \u00fd3131Unit - 2Arts and Aesthetics Section - A The P erforming Arts Performing Arts are art forms in which artists use their body or voice to convey artistic expression - as opposed to visual arts, in which artists use paint / canvas or various materials to create physical art objects. 1.

You may choose any art form such as dance, music, magic, drama, mime etc. READING 2. (a) Read about the performing arts progr amme in a school. 1. Schools throughout the country or are now implementing performing arts as a part of their curriculum. The allure of theatre, dance, film, music and other forms of arts is that these activities allow children to express themselves in a safe, positive medium. Lifelong appreciation for art in many forms is cultivated through a school's performing arts programme. This cultivates a life long appreciation for art and art forms. 2. A school's performing arts programme exposes students to theatre, dance, music and other forms of art. Without the existence of a performing arts programme, students would have to venture outside of their everyday routine, and this would make the probability of their discovering an appreciation of fine arts more unlikely than if they attended a school that has a performing arts programme. 3. The performing arts programme helps hone the skills of young performers so that they will be prepared for the competitive world of performance. Schools such as Juilliard and Professional Performing Arts High School are geared toward this very purpose. They offer students exposure to acting, music, painting, printmaking and other facets of art. Students at these schools are held to a very high standard much like professional performers in the everyday world. 4. There are certain academic requirements that students must fulfill to be eligible to participate in performing arts. This encourages students to balance and prioritize their tasks so that they may reach their goals. Typically , the discipline needed to succeed in the arts is mirrored in academics. If a student cannot cultivate the ability to study lengthy materials in English class, he may not have the capability to study a work of Shakespeare in drama class. The usual grade requirement is a C average, which is attainable for most students who are willing to apply themselves in schoolwork.33335. By tapping into latent creativity , students can express their emotions in a healthy and creative way. Self-expression is something that teens can have difficulty with when they are unhappy and frustrated, with no outlet other than violence. The evolution of performing arts has allowed for positive self- expression even among troubled youth, as it promotes a positive way to relieve angst and displaced anger . This programme has seen positive progress and has the potential to give anyone who is willing a second chance at life through art. 6. Often, students in performing arts programmes are encouraged to involve their parents and seek their help. This is a great way to involve parents in the lives of their children. Parental involvement in the arts provides opportunities for the child and parent to bond. 7. The positive influence that performing arts have on students is important for more than a straight-laced academic route. The performing arts caters to creating well-rounded individuals who are able to express themselves freely .

READING Sixteen years later she revels at how her life has changed\u2014how those life altering events allowed her the time to explore her creative side, taught her to love what she does for a living, and gave her the chance to create an art career that has placed her art in the hands of collectors all around the world.\u00fd \u00fd \u00fd 5. Rebecca M. Beal was born in Heidelberg, Germany in 1959. As a child her parents enrolled her in Art Instruction Schools. Later studying with a local portrait artist in the late 70's early 80's, introduced her to oils, which quickly became her passion. She continued some of her education at the University of San Juan, in Portrait Studies. The art completed while she was there, was donated to the school and sold at an auction. 3535Alyice: Why did you choose oil paints as your medium? Rebecca: Shortly after high school, I began painting with a local portrait artist\u2014this was my first introduction and experience with oil paints. I fell in love with the medium right away. I have tried others, but have always come back to oils. Several of my contemporaries have moved to acrylics because of the toxicity of oil paint, mediums, and cleaners but I will probably never make that move. I love the richness of the colors. Alyice: What do you wish you knew about oils before you got started? Rebecca: I suppose I wish I had known more about the different mediums available to mix with oil paint. I started with linseed oil but found it took such a long time to dry. I finally ordered several different kinds of mediums, and have settled on Gamblins Neo Megilp. It has a great consistency and dries within a couple of days. Alyice: What is the best part about working with oils? Rebecca: I love the way the paint flows, the variations I can capture, the ability to blend colours, and layer the paint. I have tried many mediums and some of the techniques I have learned. . . I bring back to my oil paintings. Alyice: How do you choose the subject of your painting? Rebecca: A lot of my subjects are from my travels. I am an avid photographer . I love the ambience of Europe, the old buildings, and flowers are everywhere. Water has always been one of my favourite things so it is a natural in my paintings. I love to express light. That's probably the one thing I have practised the most. Whether it is a sunny day or evening with lights shining, I try to notice everything. It is definitely the light that I want to stand out. I generally formulate an idea in my mind, often inspired by the elements I see... a pot overflowing with flowers, a stunning sunset, or a European caf\u00e9. Then, I work the painting around it.The interv iew with Rebecca. Alyice: What is your creative process like? Rebecca: I practised certain techniques until they became automatic. Now, I do not practise technique everyday per say, but I do start 4, 5, or 6 canvases around a similar theme. 3636I go to my easel and start drawing with a wash of acrylics. Because they dry so quickly , I can easily change as my idea transfers to canvas. Quite often I finish with something very different than what I started with. Alyice: How has your style changed over the years? Rebecca: I have worked diligently (and still do) on becoming looser with my brush strokes. I used to spend so much time trying to get it exactly right. Now, I try to capture the essence. When I started painting portraits, it was important to be exact; however my love is Mediterranean and European landscapes and seascapes. Born in Europe, I have a natural love for the ambience of the old world. I study anything and everything I can find, I have successfully adapted some styles into my style and some I still struggle with today , like the palette knife. It is a wonderful way to add texture and I think people really love heavy paint; however , it is looser than I prefer and has not allowed me to create the depth I like. I have been known to start and complete a painting upside down. I start with my wash drawing, then apply colour in loose fast strokes. For this step, I use a large flat brush. My first colours are generally deeper colours or complementary colors than the ones that follow . Then, I take my time applying a lighter or brighter color. I use a light hand here, so the textures of the paint and brush strokes are easily seen\u2014not overworked. I create layers in my paintings, and sometimes I will put an unusual colour in places you wouldn't expect so it shows through the next colour adding interest and depth. It's a lot about the play and use of the colours. Alyice: Do you ever experience creative blocks? Rebecca: I am sure we all go through creative blocks\u2014mostly I get tired I think. I paint 5 days a week; generally 8 to 10 hours a day. . . always seeking a better understanding of my media and subjects. So when a block happens I just let it be. I take a rest and wait for the next inspiration. I have a lot of fun. I listen to music or a lecture, (I am fascinated with physics) and strive to keep a child's heart alive to experiment and never stop studying. There are an abundance of artists on the web that gladly share from their experiences. As the saying goes practise, practise, practise. I think I have found my voice in technique, but I still love to try different colours or experiment with different techniques. Once I found a YouTube video of an artist doing a time lapse palette knife painting, so I laid out my paints and started the video. I wish I had taped it; it would have been really funny to see myself all over the studio, arms swinging, paint flying everywhere. In 20 minutes I had a huge painting completed. It was fun; a great learning experience and a little sweaty . Alyice: What, do you believe, is the key element in creating a good oil painting?3737Rebecca: Key elements, for me, are a central focus point or the first place the eye is drawn into the painting. . . then to help the eye move through the painting. Success is creating an energetic, but peaceful setting that I would enjoy seeing (visiting) every day\u2014and completing this process by having someone connect with the work. Alyice: What is the worst thing you've seen someone do to an oil painting, and what do you wish you could've told that artist? Rebecca: Overworking the paint. If the colour doesn't work like you intended, use your turpentine to remove it (that's painting too) or wait until it dries. Keep the colours clean, not muddy .

READING 'Seeing the World In their Own Way' by Ranjita Biswas 1. You go up a rickety stairwell, dark even in the daytime. The building on crowded Nilmoni Mitra Street in north Calcutta has seen better days, like many others in this older part of the city. You enter a small room. The red cement floor is cool to the bare feet, reminiscent of a past era. The center of the room is empty but the corners are stacked with bedrolls, utensils, water bottles. Musical instruments, drums, cymbals, gongs are piled in a corner . Section - B The Blind Oper a 39392. Today, the room is filled with the laughter of men and women in colourful attire. Two garlands of sweet-smelling flowers and boxes of sweets are arranged on a stool. Two members of the group are getting married. They exchange the garlands, bonding as husband and wife. 3. Somebody breaks into a lilting Bengali song. Among the happy chorus of congratulations and laughter you notice one difference. Both bride Chumki Pal and groom Sandeep Chatterjee are blind, as are most of the people surrounding them. Pal lost her sight at the age of two due to wrong treatment for an ailment. She is wearing a bright turquoise blue sari with gold trimmings for this memorable day. \"I know it's blue because people have told me but I can't imagine how it looks. But believe me, when I dream, I dream only in colours,\" she says. Chatterjee is an undergraduate student majoring in music at Rabindra Bharati University . Their romance blossomed when they met as members of the Blind Opera, a performing arts group of Calcutta and the only one of its kind in the country as well as in Asia that consistently puts on shows like professional groups. 4. The 36 spirited members of Blind Opera, most of whom are totally blind, demonstrate that physical disability is not an obstacle. They enact plays such as Raja (King of the Dark Chamber) or Raktakarabi (Red Oleander) by Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore, considered challenging even by veteran theatre groups. 5. Since it was launched, in 1996, Blind Opera has performed not only in Calcutta but also in other cities. The Opera is the product of four theatre afficionados - Chatterjee who took it as a challenge to get together the talents of these visually impaired men and women. Except Chatterjee, who is a social activist, all of them used to be members of well-known theatre groups of the city but broke away to devote their time and energy to developing the Blind Opera concept. 6. Why the label \"opera\" for a drama repertoire? \"Well, in older days our plays were all in opera style,\" says director Gangopadhyay . \"There was singing, dancing and dialogues accompanied by instrumental music. And that's what we do.\" 7. The idea of the Blind Opera germinated in 1994 when they conducted a workshop at the Calcutta Blind School at Behala in the southern fringe of the city to produce the play Jata Durei Jai (However Far We Travel) for its centenary celebration. After the event, the participants wanted to continue their training in performing arts. 8. The challenge to present the cast on stage is immense since space management is a problem. To solve this, the directors used ropes to separate the stage and the wings. When the actors step on the rope they know that it is the entrance to the stage. Gangopadhyay says that even though the members cannot see, they can smell, hear and touch-three elements inherent to any theatre. \"At Blind Opera, we believe that the blind can see. That is, they see in their own way, if not in our way, with the help of these abilities.\" 9. Gangopadhyay believes that, for the visually impaired, theatre is the best medium for expression of their creative urges. \"They respond instinctively; they cannot copy anyone 4040else because they cannot see. Their body language tells the story and hence it is very spontaneous.\" The cast of Blind Opera challenges the audience to judge them on their merits and not condescendingly . In the beginning there was apprehension even among the founders: were the productions going to be considered \"artistic,\" or remain just \"productions\"? To their credit, the members have earned kudos from Kolkata audiences. All the members take part in the productions, no one is left out and it is very democratic. 10. However , when they conceived the idea of such a group, the foursome did not visualize it as just a performing arts troupe. Though artistic qualities were given due importance, the focus was more on \"drama therapy\" through which they could communicate better with the world around them. 1. (a) Answer the following questions briefly . (i) The setting of the building and the mood of the inmates are diametrically opposite. Why? (ii) Chumki Pal says, \".... when I dream, I dream only in colours,\" What does she mean?11. For the members of the troupe, discovering the language of the body is in a way also a journey of the persona. Coming from diverse backgrounds but bound together by the same disability , they have found an outlet for their creativity through the plays. They do not feel isolated anymore because they can relate to their fellow performers. 12. Blind Opera does not stand isolated from other disabled groups, either . Since 2000, it has been organizing Pratibondhi or Prantik Natyotsav , a theatre festival of the disabled and marginal. \"By the marginal,\" says Pramanik, \"we mean those discarded or ignored by society , like street kids, under-privileged children etc., who do not get an opportunity to perform on a common platform.\" 13. One day of the festival is marked as a paan-supari utsav (betel nut festival). On this day, different groups exchange the traditional symbols of friendship, an effort at bridge- building within the community . 14. There is also a greater purpose behind it: to use theatre to build a community and mainstream the huge number of disabled living in isolation. Together they can be a force to demand better facilities in public life. Without such help, a blind person can experience theatre only through the whispered asides of a sighted companion. Pramanik also believes that blind children should enter the mainstream from the beginning and take part in as many physical activities as possible. \"Often, parents hide away a child with a disability or don't give as much attention. If you suddenly want a grown-up boy to play football, for example, he cannot because by that time his body is too sedentary and he cannot respond.\" 15. The big dream of the group is to establish a Natya Vidyalay , a drama school following the ideal of Tagore's Santiniketan, offering a platform for creative expression of the disabled and marginalised-all those who are economically and socially forced to stay in the periphery . Like Chumki Pal, they all dream in colour .4141(iii) Physical infirmity has not proved to be a hurdle in the lives of these inmates. Give reasons. (iv) Who does the opera owe its inception to?

Ace fashion and celebrity photographer , Anil Soman shares his success mantra. Excerpts from an interview... ON DISCOVERING HIS PASSION : I loved gadgets since childhood, especially the camera. I enjoyed carrying a camera to school picnics and clicking lots of pictures. Gradually , my passion for photography developed and intensified. HEADST ART INTO PHOT OGRAPHY : I bought a semi-professional camera when I was in class X. I began reading a learner's guide to photography to understand the basics of shutter speed aperture etc. Once I completed class XII, I decided to pursue my graduation through correspondence so that I could focus on photography full time. It was an experimental endeavor for me as photography was not appreciated as a mainstream career choice in those days. I was 16 years old when I began assisting a professional photographer to puruse my dream, I took training for four years until I started practising on my own.v)How does the 'opera' get its name? JUST A CLICK AWAY!4242FROM BASIC TO PROFESSIONAL KNOW-HOW : While training under someone, you cannot expect to be taught every minute detail. Know the basics in advance. Self-study is very important. I didn't join any photography school. Keep a camera handy while reading on photography . I used to do my homework by reading a lot of books to know technical terminology and camera parts, before heading to my guide. Books like Michael Freeman's The Photographer's Eye, The Photographer's Mind and international magazines like American Photo, Popular Photography are very helpful to hone one's photography skills. ON OPTING FOR THE UNCONVENTIONAL: It is important to have faith in yourself, especially if you are trying something unconventional. I took a bold step by choosing photography as my career 25 years ago, when it was very difficult to set up my own studio and buy expensive camera equipment. But things fall in place if you are good at your work and keen to learn too. Don't be afraid to face challenges. Read, explore, improvise and evolve. Attending a professional photography school helps but it is not mandatory . Self-help is the best way to excel. Don't choose photography as a career for the sake of money/glamour . Enjoy the art and take it up as a profession only if it goes beyond the framework of a mere job for you. It should be your passion. You can't afford to stagnate. Compete with yourself. Learn as much as you can. Keep a camera handy while reading about the basics of camera and photography . Practise a lot to polish your skills at still - photography . Remember that self-study is the key to success. Read a lot, explore and improvise. I feel that attending a professional photography school helps but it is not mandatory . Self-help is the best way to excel. Hard work pays if you pursue your goal with zeal and vigour . 2. The following words are from the article.

READING (b)Neck Chand, the creator of the Rock Garden of Chandigarh. 1. One day in the early 1960s, Nek Chand, a humble transport official in the north Indian city of Chandigarh, began to clear a little patch of jungle to make himself a small garden area. He set stones around the little clearing and before long had sculpted a few figures recycled from materials he found at hand. Gradually Nek Chand's creation developed and grew; before long it covered several acres and comprised of hundreds of sculptures set in a series of interlinking courtyards. 2. After his normal working day Chand worked at night, in total secrecy for fear of being discovered by the authorities. When they did discover Chand's garden, local government officials were thrown into turmoil. The creation was completely illegal - a development in a forbidden area which by rights should be demolished. The outcome, however , was the enlightened decision to give Nek Chand a salary so that he could concentrate full-time on his work, plus a workforce of fifty labourers. Nek Chand's great work received immediate recognition and was inaugurated as The Rock Garden of Chandigarh.Section - C An Outsider Art 4444Now over twenty five acres of several thousand sculptures set in large mosaic courtyards linked by walled paths and deep gorges, Nek Chand's creation also combines huge buildings with a series of interlinking waterfalls. The Rock Garden is now acknowledged as one of the modern wonders of the world. Over 5000 visitors each day, some 12 million people so far, walk around this vast creation - the greatest artistic achievement seen in India since the Taj Mahal. 3. The place he chose for his exotic kingdom had been designated as a land conservancy , where any kind of building was forbidden. Nevertheless, there he built a miniature world depicting Indian village life, as well as a fantasy kingdom of palaces, pavilions and other structures. Ten years later, in 1975, city inspectors stumbled across this illegal construction in the forest. The Chandigarh bureaucracy wanted it destroyed. Nek Chand's creations occupied government land that had been set aside as green space between the government buildings of Le Corbusier and the city proper . When word spread, hundreds of people found their way through the forests to see this enchanted kingdom. After much debate, the Chandigarh Landscape Advisory Committee relented and allowed Nek Chand to open his creation to the public. (i) Do you think Nek Chand's aesthetic sense / creativity was recognized? Give reasons. (ii) Mention some traits of Nek Chand. 4. In order to safeguard the sculptures and still make the pieces available for public viewing, Nek Chand placed them on high sloping terraces connected by pathways and divided by tile- embellished walls with narrow , low doorways. Most of the sculptures are smaller than life size and range in subject from human figures to monkeys, peacocks, elephants, bears and many imaginary creatures. In another section of Phase II, Nek Chand created a miniature village with shops, houses, paths, temples and a cascading waterfall. This make-believe world is enhanced further by the trees, vegetation and birds that inhabit the remaining forest. Hundreds of birds live in the garden, using the small nooks and crannies as nesting places. 5. In Phase III, Nek Chand's work has become monumental in scale. He works without formal plans but directs his workers to construct what he describes. The heart of this section of the garden are the \"great swings,\" dozens of swings that hang from huge concrete arches resembling ancient Roman aqueducts. Each of the swings can hold several people at once, and visitors take pleasure in this activity . Phase III also has several pavilions for soft rag sculpture displays, an aquarium and an open-air theater . Work continues on this section of the garden with additions to the inner boundary wall, more swings and a planned small museum. Nek Chand has not yet revealed all the details for what he says will be the most spectacular part of the Rock Garden. The elements of the garden appear to have been there many years, even though, for the most part, they are of recent construction.Think as you read4545In 1996, while Nek Chand was on a lecture tour of Europe and the United States, local officials did not prevent vandals from damaging hundreds of sculptures. This destruction halted the ongoing construction of Phase III. However , since this unfortunate incident, significant steps have been taken at local and international levels to guarantee that Nek Chand's vision will be completed and preserved for future generations. Today, Nek Chand is revered as a national hero. Nearly 3,000 people visit the garden daily, making it the most visited folk art site in the world and one of the most visited tourist sites in India. Anton Rajer (c)On the basis of your reading, answer the questions briefly . (i) Why was Nek Chand's creation considered illegal? (ii) Which things comprised his garden kingdom?

Theatre and films can bring about a sea change in the life of a waiver . Discuss in groups and share any theatre show or a film that has had a great impact on the life of a person. READING Biogr aphical sketch of the film maker like Golden Lion and UNESCO awards are just a few feathers in her cap. Mira Nair, the queen of cross-cultural films, who dared to deviate from the mainstream cinema only to steal the spotlight with her avant-garde celluloid undertakings, is genius personified. An Indian director , who successfully carved a niche for herself in the realms of short films, documentaries and feature films with her intense, novel, and at times controversial approach, Mira Nair's feat in the domain of film-making remains unparalleled to this day. Some of her best celluloid feats include her debut documentary 'India Cabaret', Wedding'. Mira's movies are never short of creative excellence, be it about social issues or her biographical foray on the life of Amelia Earhart in the film 'Amelia'. Mira has never cowed from broaching into the unfamiliar territory , a thing that has come to be the USP of her films today . A recipient of several prestigious national and international awards and nominations, the name of Mira Nair truly deserves to be etched in gold in the domain of cross-continent films. 3. Mira Nair was born in Rourkela, in a humble Punjabi family on October 15, 1957. Her father was a government official and her mother was an active social worker . She was the youngest of the three kids. As a child, she received her basic education from Loreto Convent, Tara Hall, in Shimla, where she developed her passion for dramatics and theatre. She later went on to study sociology in Miranda House, Delhi University . Soon after, in 1976, she moved to Harvard University to study sociology . During her initial college days, Mira actively participated in several political street theaters for a drama club before she moved on to the US. There she met Mitch Epstein, a photographer and Sooni Taraporevala, a screenwriter , who fired up her enthusiasm for movie making. 4. Even during her university days, Mira knew that she wanted to be a filmmaker . However , making conventional mainstream 'masala' movies was never on her cards. She debuted with television documentaries like 'Jama Street Masjid Journal', and 'So Far From India', before she made it big in the celluloid world with her debut feature film 'Salaam Bombay'. Though Mira won a string of awards including the Blue Ribbon Award for her documentary Section - D An Accomplished Filmmaker5353film 'Indian Cabaret' that revolved around the lives of workers in clubs, 'Salaam Bombay' was her biggest breakthrough. The movie won her several national and international awards and was nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and BAFTA Film Award. 'Salaam Bombay' not only established her as a successful director , but also made her the most sought after Indian director in the international film fraternity . In 1989, she started her own production house called Mirabai Films under which she produced several box office hits. Two years later, in 1991, she garnered applause for her work in the movie 'Mississippi Masala', which cast light on inter-racialism in American society . With this flick, Mira proved her forte in mainstream commercial movies and received great adulation from her critics. In the following years, she delivered a slew of successful cinemas of which 'The her chefs-d'oeuvre. 5. Achievements and Awards The account of the prestigious awards that Mira Nair has won is hard to keep, as they seem to grow with every film. Mira Nair hit gold with her very first feature film 'Salaam Bombay', which was nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1988 and have received coveted honors like Camera D'Or (for best first feature) and the Prix du Publique (for most popular entry) at the Cannes Film Festival. Her groundbreaking film 'Mississippi Masala' won three awards at the Venice film festival. 'Monsoon Wedding', Nair's biggest commercial success till date, has won the Golden Lion award at Venice Film Festival and was nominated for Golden Globe award for Best Foreign Language Film. Apart from this, Mira Nair has bagged several prestigious nominations for her films including Academy Awards, Golden Globes, BAFTA Awards and more.

Although it is set entirely abroad and the film was an international co- production between companies in India, the United States, Italy , France, and Germany . The film won the Golden Lion award and received a Golden Globe Award nomination. A musical based on the film is currently in development and is scheduled to premiere on Broadway in April of 2014. 3. The film's central story concerns a father , Lalit Verma (Naseeruddin Shah), who is trying to organize an enormous, chaotic, and expensive wedding for his daughter , Aditi (Vasundhara Das), for whom he has arranged a marriage with a man she has known for only a few weeks (Parvin Dabas as Hemant Rai).

Origin. The ancient classical dance of Tamil Nadu owes its origin to Sadir, the art of temple th th dancers of devadasis during the 19 and 20 centruries. Characteristics : Viewed as an act of devotion, it is an embodiment of music in visual form and was previously performed only within temples. It is commonly considered to be a fire dance (fire being one of the five elements) and therefore, the movements of the dancer relate to that of a dancing flame. As in Sadir, Bharatanatyam is characterized by graceful, tender and sculpturesque poses, it is solo dance with two aspects - the feminine side or lasya which includes graceful movements, and the masculine aspect or tandava ananda thandavam which symbolizes the dance of the Hindu deity Lord Shiva (in the form of Nataraja). There are three kinds of Bharatanatyam: Nritta is a pure dance without any emotions and explores a meaning through its fiastas; and Natya which is the portrayal of a specific character . Bharatanatyam Exponents : During Marathi King Sarabhoji's four brothers, Chinnayya, Ponniah, Sivanandam and Vadivelu evolved the dance form as it is known today . Their descendants became Bharatanatyam teachers in Tanjore. It was Rukmini Devi Arundale who introduced group performances and founded the Kalakshetra school in 1936. She was also one of the earlier teachers to teach it to men. Other notable exponents include Dr. Vaidyanathan. Elaborate Costume and Music : Dancers have to wear heavy jewellery , including anklets known as temple jewellery , during the performance. The costume is charming and elaborate and usually includes a heavy saree draped in a unique manner . The music accompanying a performance is in the Carnatic style. Some typical instruments like mridangam (drum ), nagaswaram (long pipe horn), flute, violin and veena [string instrument ] are used.Listening Script - 01 CULTURE TALK-DECODING BHAR TANATYAM5757Listening of Thane district in Maharashtra make Warli paintings. They do not consist of the myriad primary colours, so intimately associated with folk painting in India. Instead they are painted on an austere brown surface with the use of only one colour-white The only exception are red and yellow auspicious dots which are used to decorate the painting. The first impression of sobriety , however , is countered by the ebullience of the themes depicted. Men, animals and trees from a loose, rhythmic pattern across the entire sheet. This results in a light swinging and swirling movement, describing the day to day activities of the Warlis. Warli art was first discovered in early seventies. In many important respects, it was different from the folk and tribal idiom known to urban India till then. It did not narrate mythological stories. Warli painting though essentially the same, depicting the marriage ceremony with the vegetation goddess in the center , her guardian in a side cauk and a surrounding landscape in which the preparations for the wedding are taking place, are far from repetitive for there are considerable differences in form and content between one area and another . The Warlis are short in stature with dark, burnt complexions and broad physical features. They share a common religious awe of the Tiger God and roughly carved wooden statues of him can be found installed in all parts of the district. Agriculture is their main occupation and provides bare sustenance to the Warlis. With paddy as their main crop, harvested once a year, there is little or no surplus for the coming year. An average of two to three acres for a family of five is barely sufficient for the year and the summer months find the Warlis looking for part-time jobs. The men of the family work during summer on other farm, constructing bunds, in bricks factories, repairing road for the Government or with the forest department. The women lend a helping hand by cutting grass to be sold in the market. The rough and rugged foothiils of the Sahyadri range, which comprise the main part of Thane, afford easy refuge to those who shun contact with the outside world. The undulating landscape, leading to higher and more invincible hills in the east which forms a natural boundary between thane and the rest of the state. The Warlis live in the rugged part of the country and keep much to themselves and have their own social organisation. There is no caste differentiation among them.

READING (a) Now read about some famous people and note the qualities that made them trailblazers. 1. Galileo Galilee was an Italian astronomer and physicist who lived from 1564 to 1642. He was the first to use a telescope to observe the stars and planets. Earlier in the century , another astronomer named Nicolaus Copernicus had theorized that the Earth and other planets travelled around the sun. This was an important theory because it suggested that the earth was not the centre of the universe, as previous generations had assumed. 2. As a result of his own study , Galileo decided to support Copernicus' view of the solar system. At that time, the Catholic Church was as powerful as the most stringent dictatorship today . Everything that was done or said or thought had to be pre- approved by the Church. The Pope allowed Galileo to write a book on his views. Then A Trailblazer is one who is ____________6060one of Galileo's enemies caused him to go before an Inquisition, saying that his discoveries went against the Church's teachings. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest but managed to write another book, which was secretly published in Holland this book. Today we remember that Galileo invented an astronomical telescope. He tried to prove the things he saw to other people. The Church did not want people to believe him. 3.Madame Curie was born Maria Sklodowski in Warsaw , Poland in 1867, the youngest of five children. When she was born, Poland was controlled by Russia. Her parents were teachers, and she learned at an early age the importance of education. 4.Manya, as she was called, became a tutor to a family . She enjoyed her time there, and was able to send her father and her sister Bronya in Paris, who was studying medicine some money to support them. 5.Marie studied physics and mathematics at the Sorbonne University , Paris and quickly received her masters' degrees in both subjects. She remained in Paris after graduation and started research on magnetism. 6.For the research she wanted to do, she needed more space than her small lab. A friend introduced her to another young scientist, Pierre Curie, who had some extra room. Not only did Marie move her equipment into his lab, Marie and Pierre fell in love and married. 7.A friend of the Curies, A. Henri Becquerel, had been playing with recently discovered properties of the element uranium. He talked to Pierre and Marie about those properties and they became interested in them too. Marie Curie set about investigating the effect, which she named \"radio-activity\" for her Doctorate research. 8.Marie Curie checked many other elements to determine whether they too were radioactive. She found one, thorium, and also came across a source of radiation in a mixture called \"pitch-blend,\" which was much more powerful than either thorium or uranium. 9.Working together , it took Marie and Pierre four years to isolate the radioactive source in the pitch-blend. Marie named it radium. For the discovery of radium, Marie and Pierre won a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, which they shared with their friend A. Henri Becquerel. Shortly , Marie found that what she had discovered was not pure radium, but she was able to isolate the element itself after quite a struggle. For this work, she was given the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911. 10.During her work, Marie discovered radiation could kill human cells. She reasoned that if it could kill healthy human cells, it could kill diseased human cells and went about isolating radium for use in killing tumours. 11.In 1906 Pierre Curie was offered the position of director of the Physics Laboratory at the Sorbonne. Before he could take the position, however , he was run over by a 6161carriage and killed. After her husband died, Marie was offered and took the position, the first woman to become director of a research laboratory . 12.During the first World War, Marie Curie went to work for the French building and designing X-ray machines. Knowing that moving soldiers to a hospital before they needed surgery was not always possible, she designed the first mobile X-ray machine and travelled with it along the front lines during the war. 13.On July 4, 1934, Marie Curie died in Paris, killed by her own experiments. She died of radiation poisoning and may have been the first person to do so. Marie Curie had brought herself up from poverty , struggling to get her education and succeeding brilliantly . The work she did, she did with patience, often getting results only after years of careful experimentation, while struggling for money to support her work. For her struggles, she received two Nobel Prizes - the first woman to win even one. Through the knowledge she gained, thousands of lives have been saved. 14.From wheelchair that operates through breathing to anti-theft mechanism for cars, at 20, Susant Pattnaik is a serial entrepreneur . Being a greatly motivated inventor his areas of interest include scientific innovations & research. His first successful invention, Susant's Breathing Sensor Apparatus, a device where disabled person can conduct their daily necessary jobs through breathing actions, which won him numerical national and international awards and considerations. 15.He has already earned the sobriquet of 'serial innovator', having invented several new devices and gizmos since his high school days. Now, he is well on his way to become a serial entrepreneur . 16.Susant Pattnaik, son of a veterinary doctor from Bhubaneswar , has an enviable list of achievements. He has featured in the investors list of MIT, addressed students of IITs and has founded a couple of companies to market his inventions. He even has a supporting NGO for innovators like him. 17.\"I have just signed a Rs.50 lakh deal with a company to market the car security system I have developed,\" Pattnaik informed enthusiastically while showing off his innovations at the exhibition of grassroots innovators at Rashtrapati Bhawan campus. He is among top winners of the seventh National Grassroots Innovation Awards, given by the National Innovation Foundation. 18.A student of integrated M.Sc. degree course in Physics at Indian Institute of Science Education and R esearch at Bhopal, P attnaik has ten innovations that have made the critical transition from idea to working prototype. One of them is moving into commercial production soon. He has founded four start ups. Needless to add, he lists Dhirubhai Ambani among his role models. 19.An interesting innovation of his is wheelchair which the paralysed can operate just through breathing. The prototype uses a breathing sensor developed by him and lets users navigate the chair by giving commands just with their breath. \"The sensor acts both on air and heat in our breath\", explains Pattnaik.626220.The foundation scouts for innovations from all over the country , gives awards to the best ones and also converts technologies with potential into products. So far it has filed 550 patents on behalf of innovators of which thirty nine patents have been granted in India and four in the US. Its Micro Venture Innovation Fund has provided risk capital for 183 projects, which are at different stages of incubation. (b) What are the qualities that go into the making of a scientist?

GRAMMAR REVIEW : Tense forms Verb tenses are tools that are used to express time. They refer to the time of action and tell the time and state of an action. Corresponding to the three divisions of time there are three tenses: The Present Tense referring to present time. The Past Tense referring to past time. The Future Tense referring to future time. Each tense has four forms:6464Simple or Indefinite - it merely states an action or event. It does not say anything about the completeness of the action. Continuous or Progressive - it indicates that an action is in progress at a given time and is incomplete at the point of reference Perfect - it indicates that the action is complete Perfect Continuous - it indicates that an action has been in progress for a period of time Study the table for use of tenses given below: We use SIMPLE PRESENT for 1.

READING 1.When you hear the word 'robot' what do you think of? Most people may imagine metal machines from science fiction that look a lot like human beings and also move, act or work like them. 2. The term \"robot\" is derived from the Czechoslovakian word 'robota' which means \"tedious labour\" or hard work! 1920, the playwright Karel Capek, created the word \"robot\" in his play RUR or Rossum's Universal Robots. In the play, humanoid machines take over the world by killing all the humans\u2014well, all but one. Not to worry , though, because those kinds of robots don't exist.....yet. In reality , robots do not look like human beings. There are already almost a million robots at work in the world. Almost none of them look like the robots in science-fiction movies. 3.Robots are machines. They are machines that are controlled by computers. In car factories, for example, there are robots that look like cranes and are used for welding and painting. Robots that are used to get rid of bombs look like wheel barrows. Most industrial robots are just mechanical arms. They are used for lifting and moving things. These arms are strong enough to carry things across a factory floor. Robot arms can bend. Some robot arms bend like an elephant's trunk. Some robot arms can make themselves longer or shorter . Many robot arms have parts on the end that can hold things. The parts are called 'grippers'. They work like a human hand, but they often don't look much like a hand. Special kinds of grippers can handle tools or move things around. Robots can, of course, work almost like human beings. They can perform more than one action. Automatic machines can do the same action again and again, but robots are better because they can perform different actions. This is because they have a small computer , which functions as their brain, inside them. This tells them what to do. Some robot arms have sensors. The sensors tell the computer where the arm is. The computer makes the motors move the arm if it is not in the right place. 4.In some ways, robots can work better than human beings: some robots handle chemicals that are dangerous for humans to touch. Some robots go to dangerous places like on top of volcanoes and in burning buildings, without feeling scared. Robots can go deep underwater to search for sunken ships or look for minerals to mine. 70705.Robots can move quicker than humans can, and they never get bored. Most robots are designed to do only one specific job. A different robot must be specially made for each job that needs to be done. Robots help explore Mars and other planets. They find out what the planets look like and what they are made of. Robot rovers that look like little wagons landed on the planet Mars. They rolled around and examined the rocks and soil. How do robots know what to do? Computer programmers write a programme to give the robot a series of instructions for carrying out a task. For example, a programme may tell a robot to pick up an object, do something with it and then put it in the right place. The computer inside the robot has a memory which remembers these instructions. When the programme in the computer is changed, the robot learns to do something different. 6.Some robots can even see. 'Seeing' robots work with the help of a television camera and two computers. The television camera, which is the 'eye', passes the information to one computer; this computer than passes the information to the other computer which controls the robot's movements. These robots help doctors do operations. Robots help replace hips. They help doctors operate on eyes. Scientists and engineers are working to make better robots. They are trying to make robots with computers that are smarter . One day there will be robots that make highways and build steel skyscrapers. There may someday be robots that help with many chores around the house. Tiny robots may one day be able to go into clogged blood vessels and clean them out. Tiny robots may be able to go inside broken machines and fix them. Very smart robots may eventually be able to run a whole factory by themselves. c.

The new technique came from a fashion expert and a scientist. The new jeans could break the ground because of their strength. The jeans turn harmful emissions into harmless chemicals. The inventors placed a pair of their jeans in a showcase.7575READING 1.3 An innovative blend of fashion and science has resulted in the design of a new technology in jeans that cleans the air. Helen Storey , professor of fashion and science at The London College of Fashion, teamed up with Dr Tony Ryan, Pro-vice-chancellor for the Faculty of Science at the University of Sheffield, to create what could be a ground-breaking solution to our environmental problems. They discovered that when denim is coated with tiny particles of the chemical titanium dioxide, it reacts with air and light to absorb and break down harmful emissions in the environment. The emissions become harmless and are washed away when the jeans are cleaned. This means we can help clean the air simply by going for a walk. Ms Story and Dr Ryan have created a company to showcase their invention, called Catalytic Clothing. Their website says: \"Catalytic Clothing seeks to explore how clothing and textiles can be used as a catalytic surface to purify air, employing existing technology in a new way.\" The technology is similar to how a catalytic converter in a car helps clean the fuel mix. Ryan makes bold claims about how effective the innovation could be. He maintains that if all of Sheffield's half a million residents wore the jeans to become walking air filters, the dangerous chemical nitrogen oxide in the city would disappear . The improvement in air quality could significantly reduce deaths and respiratory illnesses such as asthma. WRITING 2.

Title: Concise and informative, not vague and general, but encapsulates the essence of the research. e.g. Onset of Autism not linked to Vaccination 2. Introduction: Let the readers/ audience know why the report is important and what exactly the report is about. Answer questions such as- What do you hope to learn from the research? What question is being asked? Why is this research important? Start generally , introducing the broad context within which your research fits and end with a statement of your specific hypothesis or hypotheses. 3. Method: Precisely describe method and materials used to conduct the experiment with enough detail so that someone else can repeat the same procedure. Explain and sometimes justify why you chose a particular method. Finally , it is important to add any extra information or observations of events during the study that may have happened accidentally . Write in paragraph form, with few repetitions. Divide it into subsections such as -participants - materials -procedure. Use the past tense forms and furthermore, as the focus in this section is on what was done rather than who did it, use the passive voice forms. 4. Results: Describe but not explain your results; it provides the reader with a factual account of your findings. 5. Discussion: Two fundamental aims: -to explain the results -to explore the significance of the findings. Therefore, here, -interpret and explain your results -examine whether and how the questions raised in the introduction section have been answered; -show how your results relate to the literature; -qualify and explore the theoretical importance/significance of your results; outline any new research questions or areas for future research that your results have suggested. 6. References: It is essential to include a reference list or bibliography of the reference material consulted during the research for the report.83837. Appendices: Information that is not essential to explain the findings, but that supports the analysis (especially repetitive or lengthy information), validates your conclusions or pursues a related point should be placed in an appendix/ appendices.

They belong to various disciplines of engineering namely Aerospace, Electrical, Mechanical, Metallurgy etc., in different years ranging from first to final year under graduation. complete the team. Surya Ragunaathan chats with team 'Matsya'. What is this underwater vehicle all about? It is called 'Matsya' or fish in Sanskrit. It is an autonomous underwater vehicle designed and developed to localize itself in an underwater environment and perform real life navy based tasks. The vehicle will take feedback from visual, inertial, acoustic and pressure sensors which are used to control the thrusters and pneumatic actuators. The current prototype has 5 degrees of freedom and is a test bench for integration of all basic systems of mechanical (namely hull and frame), electronics (namely power management, motion controller , SBC and sensors) and software(Image processing, Real time framework and control systems). How did you guys think of this idea (any anecdotes?) How did you all come together? We all as a team have been participating at ABU Robocon for the past two years. The team has won awards of \"Best Autonomous Machine\" and \"Best Design Award\" at Robocon 2011. Just that, the 8585team felt they must venture into a new dimension of Robotics and further upgrade their skills. Of all the options Robosub, an annually organized competition in San Diego, California by AUVSI foundation was the most attractive choice. Can you describe step-by-step how you built this? Since we were building an underwater vehicle for the first time, we wanted to build a very basic one that navigates from one place to the other and see all issues that we face in building one. The team is divided in to three divisions: Mechanical, Electronics and Software. Discussions began on an abstract level and slowly each sub-division started with the designing of their subdivisions. The basic architecture in each subdivision was designed keeping in mind that later complexities could be easily added in them. Modularity and R obustness were given utmost priority in this process. After the basic designs were made, they were prototyped and tested. For example, waterproofing took a month to test and get it perfect etc. All electronic boards were extensively tested before mounting them in the vehicle. All software modules were tested on test benches before the hardware team was ready with the vehicle. How long did you take to build it? Did you bunk lectures and work on it? Or was it done only in your spare time? It took us six months and still the vehicle is in the testing phase. All the concepts that we had learned in classrooms were seen being implemented in practical. We work after class hours. In the evening, after 5 pm everyone meets up and work the entire evening, most often right up to 4 am. In what ways can one make use of the vehicle commercially? As far as applications of 'Matsya' are concerned, there are various options: a) Defence Reconnaissance Monitoring Detection Surveillance b) Underwater power lines Line monitoring c) Oil and Gas Industry Seabed survey Pipeline monitoring d) Marine Science R esearch Marine Biology R esearch Oceanography Studies e) Shipwreck R econnaissance f) Academic8686Research Development Teaching Do you see it as a commercial viable product in its present state? How do you plan to market it? The entire vehicle was built as an exercise for the team towards developing a final product. Ease for the user to control the vehicle was the primary objective. But we feel the next version, which we plan to release next year will be a much advanced version, as far as features are concerned and also commercially . Marketing the vehicle commercially is not in the 'To Do' list currently but definitely an option the team is currently thinking on. How has being at IIT-Bombay helped you with this whole thing? We have received financial support from our deans at IIT Bombay . The project is mentored by Prof. Hemendra Arya from Aerospace Engineering department and Prof. Leena Vachhani from the System and Controls Engineering department. They have been a constant source of motivation for all of us all along. What do your parents and faculty members have to say about the same? Everyone seems to be very happy and proud with the output of the team. We feel bad we have to stay away from our homes in vacations and be in lab working on the vehicle, but fortunately our parents realize our passion and support us in every form possible. 1. Earmuff s \"Baby , Its Cold Outside\": \"Baby , Its Cold Outside\" may have been the song running through 13 year old Chester Greenwood's head one cold December day in 1873. To protect his ears while ice skating, he found a piece of wire, and with his grandmother' shelp, padded the ends. In the beginning, his friends laughed at him. However , when they realized that he was able to stay outside skating long after they had gone inside freezing, they stopped laughing. Instead, they began to ask Chester to make ear covers for them, too. At age 17Chester applied for a patent. For the next 60 years, Chester's factory made earmuff s, and Earmuff s made Chester rich. 2. Windshield Wipers: It was a snowy day in New York City in 1902, and it was Mary Anderson's first trip on a streetcar . Mary watched the driver shiver as he reached out to clear the snow that had piled up on the windshield. Mary took out her notebook and began to draw. She designed an arm that would swing back and forth on the windshield. The arm would be controlled by a lever near the driver inside the streetcar . Windshield wipers have changed over the years. Today, every kind of vehicle has windshield wipers so that the driver can drive safely on a rainy or snowy day and keep warm at the same time.Listening Text : 02 87873. Band-Aid: At the turn of the century , Mrs. Earle Dickson, an inexperienced cook, often burned and cut herself. Mr. Dickson, a Johnson and Johnson employee, got plenty of practice in hand bandaging. Out of concern for his wife's safety , he began to prepare bandages ahead of time so that his wife could apply them by herself. By combining a piece of surgical tape and a piece of gauze, he fashioned the first crude adhesive strip bandage. 4. Ice cream Cones: In 1904, Arnold Fornachou was selling ice cream at the World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri. It was a hot summer day, and he had so many customers that he ran out of ice cream dishes. The baker next to Arnold was named Ernest Hamwi. Ernest was selling very thin pastries. Arnold and Ernest decided to work together . They rolled Ernest's pastries into a cone shape and filled them with ice cream. Arnold's and Ernest's idea led to a new invention - the ice cream cone. 5. Velcro: In 1948, while George de Mestral was hiking in the woods, he noticed small, prickly burrs sticking to his clothes. Later, George looked at one burr under a microscope. He saw it was covered with hundreds of tiny hooks. He realized that he could use this idea to fasten two things together . Unlike other fasteners, Velcro can work on many different types of materials and in many different places. In 1948, George de Mestralinvented Velcro and though people laughed at first, he stuck by his invention.8888Unit - 4Exploring New A venues 1.

From a very young age, Florence Nightingale's compassion for the suffering made her 1 active in ministering to the ill and poor people in the village neighbouring her family's estate. By the time she was 16 years old, it was clear to her that nursing was her calling. She believed nursing to be her divine purpose. 2.

In the early 1850s, Nightingale returned to London, where she took a nursing job. The position proved challenging as Nightingale grappled with a cholera outbreak and unsanitary conditions. She made it her mission to improve hygiene practices, significantly lowering the death rate at the hospital in the process. The hard work took a toll on her health, and soon after, the biggest challenge of her nursing career presented itself. 4. In October of 1853 the Crimean War broke out. Thousands of British soldiers were sent to the Black Sea, where supplies quickly dwindled. By 1854, no fewer than 18,000 soldiers had been admitted into military hospitals. 5. At the time, there were no female nurses stationed at hospitals in the Crimea. The poor reputation of past female nurses had led the war office to avoid hiring more. But, after the Battle of Alma, England was in an uproar about the neglect of their ill and injured soldiers, who not only lacked sufficient medical attention due to hospitals being horribly understaffed, but also languished in appallingly unsanitary and inhumane conditions. 6. In late 1854, Nightingale received a letter from the Secretary of War, Sidney Herbert, asking her to organize a corps of nurses to tend to the sick and fallen soldiers in the Crimea. Nightingale rose to her calling. She quickly assembled a team of 34 nurses and sailed with them. 7. Although they had been warned of the horrid conditions there, nothing could have prepared Nightingale and her nurses for what they saw when they arrived at Scutari. The hospital sat on top of a large cesspool, which contaminated the water and the hospital building itself. Patients lay on in their own excrement on stretchers strewn throughout the hallways. Rodents and bugs scurried past them. The most basic supplies, such as bandages and soap, grew increasingly scarce as the number of ill and wounded steadily increased. Even water needed to be rationed. More soldiers were dying from infectious diseases like typhoid and cholera than from injuries incurred in battle. 8. Nightingale quickly set to work. She procured hundreds of scrub brushes and asked the least infirm patients to scrub the inside of the hospital from floor to ceiling. Nightingale 2 (here) destined for 9090herself spent every waking minute caring for the soldiers. In the evenings she moved through the dark hallways carrying a lamp while making her rounds, ministering to patient after patient. The soldiers, who were both moved and comforted by her endless supply of compassion, took to calling her \"the Lady with the Lamp.\" Others simply called her \"the Angel of Crimea.\" Her work reduced the hospital's death rate by two-thirds. 9. In addition to vastly improving the sanitary conditions of the hospital, Nightingale created a number of patient services that contributed to improving the quality of their hospital stay. She instituted the creation of an \"invalid's kitchen\" where appealing food for patients with special dietary requirements was cooked. She established a laundry so that patients would have clean linens. She also instituted a classroom and a library , for patients' intellectual stimulation and entertainment. 10. Based on her observations in the Crimea, Nightingale wrote Notes on Matters Affecting the Health, Efficiency and Hospital Administration of the British Army , an 830-page report analyzing her experience and proposing reforms for other military hospitals operating under poor conditions. The book would spark off the establishment of a Royal Commission for the Health of the Army in 1857 11. She returned in the summer of 1856, once the Crimean conflict was resolved.

INDIAN HANDICRAFTS 1. The crafts of India have been valued universally; their existence as an industry that is getting highly organized, justifies the need for efforts to be put into their preservation. Contemporary designers are constantly drawing on the traditional crafts to blend them into their haute couture designs. Thus, proving their adaptability to the need of the individual designer catering to international markets. The National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) includes education of traditional crafts in their course curriculum. Statistics from the All India Handicrafts Board show that craft export has risen from 23 crores to over 9000 crores since the past 50 years. It is in recognition of this need that Bangalore has decided to allot a certain space for the craftsmen from all over India. Read at this report. 2. Most of our crafts have gained worldwide recognition that has created an ever-growing demand for them. As a result, artistically aware and enterprising entrepreneurs have taken it upon themselves to ensure that Indian crafts become an organized industry . This has not only helped to get recognition and a new lease of life for these crafts , they have also become a part of the curriculum in institutes like NIFT, NID, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International School of Textile and Management, to name a few. 3. The Indian crafts that hold a pride of place in the heart of art collectors globally , are made from a variety of materials and substances, be it wood or stone, bamboo or silk, all available aplenty in their natural form. The Indian artisan, over the centuries, perfected the skill of willing these substances to obey their hands and get moulded into pieces of art. Let us read about some of these crafts. 4. Wood, particularly costly ones like sandal, sheesham, rosewood and kadamb are used for the production of beautiful handicraft items depicting various symbols of India's rich cultural heritage. There are production centres in Karnataka, Rajasthan and other places. Objects made of sandalwood are the most famous among the other wooden artefacts for its intricate carving and its sweet fragrance. Madurai Varanasi have the most skillfull artisans using their workmanship to create artefacts. The images of elephant, ambawari , peacock and other cultural symbols are carved on these woods which make them unique. Furniture made from the famous sheesham wood from Saharanpur has always held a pride of place in Indian homes. The ever increasing demand for the beautifully carved furniture with intricate brass and copper inlays has attracted many young artisans and entrepreneurs to this industry . 5. India is the home to a variety of metal craft. The glitter of this craft is universal, be it gold, silver or any other metal; so, from times immemorial, metal products crafted from brass, copper and bell metal have held pride of place in homes and royal courts across the world. The important metal craft centres are Moradabad, Jaipur , Delhi etc. What started 9898in ancient times as small scale ventures is on the threshold of becoming one of the major industries requiring trained artisans with a vision because although inexpensive they become invaluable possessions of art lovers across the world. The handcrafted Indian jewellery studded with precious and semi-precious or embellished with meenakari work is an eternal process of artistic imagination and fine craftsmanship from ancient times. Jewellery design in India varies from state. Courses for specialisation in gemology and designing of jewellery have gained in popularity as demand for cost effective yet aesthetic costume jewellery has grown beyond conceivable proportions. 6. Today Papier Mache artefacts and utility items are favoured by Indians and tourists alike. A variety of papiermache objects are made raging from utility items to decorative objects. The most common Papier Mache items are boxes in different shapes and sizes, Christmas decorations in bell shape and ball shape, masks and animal figures. Apart from Kashmir , Papier Mache art also became popular in Rajasthan, Bihar , Andhra P radesh and other centres. 7. The exquisite art of Marble inlay work from Agra, brought from Persia in the Mughal period, has been an integral part of our cultural heritage , and has been kept alive by the descendants of the great artisans who gave the world the mesmerizing Taj Mahal. Marble inlay today enjoys a renaissance and is geared towards meeting an ever-increasing demand for decorative gift items. The world of Indian Haute couture has seen our internationally famous designers draw copiously on the exquisite work created by the nimble fingers of Indian women, be it Phulkari from Punjab, Kantha from Bengal, chhikankari from Uttar Pradesh and the famous Zardozi work to lend that Indian ethnic touch to their products, which makes them highly sought after. Their patronage of these crafts has not only given them a new lease of life , they have also become attractive career choices of the younger generation. 8. Madhubani painting or Mithila paintings from the Mithila region of Bihar were originally done on walls during festivals and other such occasions. It was artists like Jagdamba Devi and late Mahasundari Devi whose efforts are responsible in getting it international recognition. Madhubani paintings find a pride of place in our homes today . One can see the tourists flocking to the Madhubani stalls in craft bazaars like the Dilli Haat. It needed educated and ethnically aware people to bring this aspect of our culture on the international scene and make the younger generations take pride in them so that they voluntarily made a studied choice of them as career options. 9. Today's craftsmen not only command respect in society they also ensure handsome remuneration for their craft. The twenty-first century has brought with it a mind set at variance with the die-hard 10.

It is said that the National Defence Academy not only makes men out of boys it also trains them to become Officers and Gentlemen for life and so, while they are at the academy they are referred to as 'Gentlemen Cadets .'Defense Service1051052. A career in the Indian armed forces is different from all other career options. It is not just a job. It is a fiery devotion and commitment to the nation fuelled by the spirit of patriotism and a conviction that 'Nation comes before Self.' A career as an officer in the Indian armed forces is a prestigious career that offers you an exclusive life style with the honour of being the defenders of the Nation. If one is ideologically suited to such a career and considers oneself as patriotic then one may opt for a career in any one of the three services -The Indian army, The Indian air force or The Indian navy. If the notion of heroism attached to the defence forces appeals to you then it is for you, as says the adline for the SSB -You have it in you. 3. An officer in the Indian Army inherits glorious heritage and timeless traditions, blended perfectly with the latest technology in the fields of management, engineering and medical sciences. It offers a golden opportunity to be a part of the world's finest Army and get trained not only to be an Officer but also a gentleman for life.Life in the army is full of adventure and offers an enviable life style attractive pay and perks. It creates leaders who are capable of leading from the front in any field. Army has it all- be it social interaction, finest clubs, golf courses, medical facilities and ample opportunities to indulge in adventure and sports.In fact you are paid to lead a healthy life in a healthy environment. The question is: Do you have it in you? 4. The Guardians of our Skies, our Air Warriors with their supersonic jets, state-of-the-art technology are the blue -eyed boys of the defence services . They are where the action is. The Indian air force provides the most modern facilities, and an unparalleled way of life creating an environment, to bring out the best in its personnel. An officer holds a position of authority - able to lead and control. Air force helps one develop leadership and management skills, team work and communication skills. The service helps one to face pressures with ease. In fact all these are a part of the training of an Officer . The air force teaches all, thus not only making mature men and women of young boys and girls but making them leaders in life. The strength of character and strong moral compass thus acquired makes them stand out in any crowd at all times 5. Besides being a noble service devoted to the security of our skies, it is most certainly an honourable profession to be proud of. Life in this service is not just about work alone, it provides best of recreation facilities, sports, medical, education and clubs. It helps 106106nurture lifetime relations, creating bonds that transcend all barriers of time and space. 6. Just as the, the north borders guarded by our vigilant soldiers our vast coast line is jealously guarded by our navy Our maritime capabilities are as ancient as the seas that surround us on the three sides of the peninsula. But its organized form into a th regular fighting force is the work of the 17 century Maratha Emperor , Chhatrapati Shivaji Raje Bhonsle who is considered as the Father of Indian navy. The Indian navy can trace its lineage back to the Royal Indian Navy, however , the modern navy, as it is known today , was not officially created until 1947 after independence. 7. Though the primary objective of the navy is to secure the nation's maritime borders, India also uses its navy to enhance its international relations through joint exercises, port visits and humanitarian missions, including disaster relief. Certain core values given below , are instilled in the cadets of the armed forces during their training moulding their personalities that make a mark wherever they go. 8. Our armed forces have produced heroes in keeping with the noble traditions inherent in the services. Company Quarter Master Havildar Abdul Hamid was born on 1 July 1933, in Uttar Pradesh. He was enrolled in the 4 Grenadiers on 27 December 1954. During his Army service he earned the Sainya Seva Medal with Clasp J&K, the Samar Seva Medal and the Raksha Medal. During the 1965 Indo-P ak War, 4 Indian Division was entrusted with a two-fold responsibility - capture Pak territory east of Ichhogil Canal and contain possible enemy attack on Kasur-Khem Karan axis. The 4th Indian Division succeeded in reaching Ichhogil but the powerful Pakistani offensive forced it to fall back on Asal Uttar. The 4 Indian Division settled here to meet the enemy assault. 9. On 10 September when the enemy penetrated the forward company positions, Hamid was commanding a recoilless gun detachment. He realised the gravity of the situation so he moved out with his gun mounted jeep. Intense enemy shelling did not deter this brave heart. His accurate fire shot down the leading enemy tank and then another one but by this time the enemy had spotted him. This made the enemy concentrate heavy firing towards him. Abdul did not give up and brought down another enemy tank. At this time he was mortally wounded. His bravery inspired his comrades to put up a gallant fight. Havildar Abdul Hamid continued fighting with total disregard to his personal safety . In the highest tradition of the Indian Army Hamid went down fighting. The nation honoured Company Quarter Master Havildar Abdul Hamid posthumously with the highest wartime gallantry medal, The Param Vir Chakra. 10. Lt. Khetrapal, who was 21years old at that time, was commissioned just six months before the 1971 war in the tank regiment -17 Pune Horse. His tank was hit but he refused to retreat, instead he charged after the enemy . He secured the 107107bridge head but died doing so. His mother Maheshwari Khetrapal, now 89, says she's proud her son died a soldier's death. For courage in the face of death, Lt. Khetrapal received India's highest gallantry award, the Param Vir Chakra. th 11. 9 December 1971... amidst the rumbling sounds of war a desperate struggle took place about 40 nautical miles off the coast of Diu. Captain Mahendranath Mulla was determined to save lives on the Blackwood anti-submarine frigate INS Khukri. Torpedoed by a submarine, this became the only Indian ship to sink,a chapter in its history that Indian Navy will never forget. One of the most gripping battle stories which salutes courage. Captain Mulla went about saving as many of the crew he could, not caring for his own life. Gentleman and a True Guardian of the Nation's seas he upheld the age old tradition that 'A Captain never abandons his ship, he goes down with it.' His exemplary courage has motivated generations of naval officers. For his dedication and gallantry he was awarded The Maha Vir Chakra posthumously . 2.1 (a) Complete the chart suitably .

In the modern world, Paramedical science has emerged as an important branch of medical science. It is proved as a milestone in the treatment of communicable, non- communicable diseases. In other words, we can say that paramedical science is a backbone for medical science because right diagnosis of any disease is necessary to prevent fatal diseases. Thus, medical science will be paralysed without paramedical science. The continuous expansion of the health care industry brings a more demand for trained paramedical professionals. The main areas in paramedical education include Physiotherapy , Pharmacy , Nursing, Occupational therapy , Audiology and therapy , Medical laboratory technology , Radiology/X-Ray technology , Dental hygienist and Dental mechanics, Operation theatre assistant, Optometry and Ophthalmic assistant and other miscellaneous job oriented courses. These courses are offered through correspondence as well as full time classes. The personality of a paramedical professional should be according to the circumstances provided. As this is a team work, so they should have a blend of qualities like sense of responsibility and dedication, good communication skill, analytical and logical reasoning skill, ability to recall and memorize scientific facts, physical stamina to work long and irregular hours, patience, cool temperament, team spirit, good observation power , understanding of people, and an ability to inspire confidence in the patient. Apart from all these, one must have a pleasant smiling face, whatever be the situation. Interv iewer: Laila, tell us something about Dastkar Nature Bazaar . Laila: The Bazaar is only the public face of Dastkar . It is the culmination of a whole lot of processes where we work with craftsmen on enhancing skills, capacity building, etc., which is why the end result is that we register 10000 foot falls each day of the bazaar and that too when so many craft bazaars have come up. But it drives me crazy when people say, 'Oh, you have such a nice job, you travel and pick up stuff.' I dislike these two words 'pick up' and 'stuff'. We don't pick up, we help them develop their crafts and diversify . Interv iewer: We believe your topmost agenda is of doing away with the exploitative middlemen. How do you do that? Laila: This has been something that has been part of our objective right from the beginning when we began 30 years ago but it didn't mean every middleman but the exploitative ones. I don't want Listening Text 1: Listening Text 2: 111111every craftsperson to become an entrepreneur when they should be focusing on their craft. The idea is to educate the artisans about the value of their skill and educate the buyers about the worth of the craft and only then fair trade can take place. We need the middlemen whether it is Fab India, hi-end stores or the government emporias. Interv iewer: How do you get to interact with the artistes? Laila: Every month, I spend around ten days in the rural areas trying to understand their needs which can't be done sitting in Shahpur Jat. A group of women weavers in a village may not move out of their village due to the constraints of the society , so their needs would be different from a set of male leather workers. Interv iewer: Tell us something about your pet projects. Laila: The objective behind the Dastkar Ranthambore Project was to try and find source of income generation for the villagers who had lost their homes and had to be resettled. They had lost access to wood, water and the forests they had been living on for generations. Valmik Thapar asked me what we could do in terms of economic rehabilitation. So, when I met them they were all very bitter and said there are no crafts here. I hated doing it but I had to dive into their homes and houses and find for myself how the people of this agrarian community lived. I discovered that everything they used from a gudri to toys to basket, a majority of utility items were made out of waste material. What started from suspicion, hostility turned into 300 families and a turnover of one crore rupees. Another one was Lambani embroidery . It wasn't known everywhere and the Lambani women at that time had switched over to making plastic aprons. I shrieked when I saw a couple of women in Sandur , in now infamous Bellary district, doing that and asked why you make that ghastly stuff. I was told that nothing sells and lambani is very expensive. Interv iewer: What is the state of affairsnow? Laila: We are losing 10 per cent of our craftsmen every year as they are shifting to other jobs. On the other hand the global market is recognising the value of the handicrafts. Around the world, people are getting bored of the high streets same brands available everywhere. Even in India, fatigue has set in and there is realisation that if we want something unique we will have to go back to our handicrafts because that is the only mechanism which can offer experimentation and a different look. Interv iewer: Tell us some Success stories Laila: Berozgar Mahila Kalyan Samiti of Bihar were bonded labourers for 20 years because they couldn't pay a loan of Rs.500 taken years ago. They were paying 18 per cent interest on it. A donation given to us by a friend was used to repay their loan following which they were trained in weaving. Today they weave beautiful tussar saris worth Rs.30 to 40 lakhs. Citation of Award for Major Som Nath Sharma *4 Kumaon IC -521 On 3rd. November 1947 Maj. Sharma's Coy was ordered on a fighting patrol to Badgam Village in Srinagar (Kashmir) Valley. He reached his objective at first light on 3rd. November , 1947, and took Listening text 3: 112112up a position south of Badgam Village. At 1100 hours, enemy estimated strength 700 attacked his Coy position being brought to bear on the Coy position from three sides, the Coy began to sustain heavy casualties. Maj. Sharma fully realizing the gravity of the situation and the direct threat that would result to both Srinagar and the aerodrome if the enemy attacking him was not held until reinforcements could be rushed up to close up the gap leading to Srinagar via Hum Hom, urged his Coy to fight the enemy - tenaciously with extreme bravery . In order to do this, he rushed across the open ground to his sections exposing himself to heavy and active fire. He took a very active part in directing the fire of his sections on to the ever-advancing enemy . He exposed himself to the full fury of the enemy's fire and laid out air-strips in order to guide the aircraft on to the targets in full view of the enemy . Realising that casualties had affected the efficiency of his light automatics, this officer , whose right hand was in plaster , personally commenced filling LMG magazines and issuing them to LMG gunners. A mortar shell landing amongst his ammunition resulted in an explosion that killed him. Maj. Sharma's Coy held on to its position and the remnants withdrew when almost completely surrounded. His inspiring example had resulted in the enemy being delayed for six hours and reinforcements permitted to get into position in Hum- Hom to stem the tide of the enemy's advance. His leadership, gallantry and tenacious defence was such that his men were inspired to fight the enemy outnumbered by them seven to one for six hours, one hour of which was after this gallant officer had been killed. He has set an example of courage, with qualities unequalled in the history of the Indian Army. His last message to Brigade HQ received a few moments before he was killed was The enemy are only 50 yards from us. We are heavily outnumbered. We are under devastating fire. I shall not withdraw an inch but will fight to the last man and the last round. [ *Before reading the text the teacher should explain that 4 Kumaon is the name of the regiment into which Maj. Som Nath Sharma had been commissioned. IC stands for Indian st Commission and he was the 521 officer to be commissioned, therefore '4 Kumaon IC 521']113113Unit - 5Speaking and Listening - A R eview Section - A Note: It is not always about learning to speak and listen effectively in English only to pass an assessment , clear a placement test or a job interv iew! Have you ever thought about the different forces that are affecting education today? The emergence of new job markets requires enhanced communication skills, multi-cultural awareness and better teamwork. These, and a range of other significant factors are continuously defining and shaping the education scenarios all over the world. With over 2 billion users of the English language, it has emerged as the most commonly used language of international business, education and communication. However , at the same time, English language too is changing as it comes into contact with new cultures, communities and countries. In this emerging scenario, the knowledge of English and effective communication skills st have become imperative for the 21 century learners. 1 Read the questions and choose the most appropriate option. (a)Do you use English words when you are talking in your mother tongue? (i) some times (ii) always (iii) never (b) Which of the following words are now part of the English dictionary? (i) guru; pandit, shawl (ii) bazar , karma, yoga (iii) all the above (c) How do you react when someone mispronounces a word e.g snakes , instead of snacks ? (i) Tell the speaker that it is incorrect (ii) Try to understand his/her pronunciation (iii) Start laughing (d) What is the most important when you talk in English? (i) good accent (ii) fluency (iii) intelligibility114114(e) Do you make eye contact with your teacher when you are seeking his or her advice? (i) sometimes (ii) always (iii) never (f) Do you grope for words when trying to express yourself in English? (i) some times (ii) always (iii) never What do the answers to these questions tell you? These answers clearly demonstrate that gestures like eye contact, nodding your head, or hand movements (item e.) play an important role in good communication. (items b. and c.) convey the message that we use many words of English in our day-to-day communication like school, station, party , exams. Similarly , many words, not only from the Indian languages, but from other languages across the globe, have found a place in the English language. Users of English come from diverse social, cultural and economic backgrounds so, their spoken English can be influenced by their mother tongue (item d.). However , it is critical that our speech is intelligible to all speakers of English and therefore the choice of appropriate words and language structures (item f.) plays an important role in good communication. 2 .Working in pairs, discuss the given questions. (a) Why do you greet someone with Good Evening when you meet a friend at 10:00 p.m.? (b) Why do you focus on the audience when making a presentation? (c) Why won't you dress up in a casually when you go to meet someone in the office? (d) Why don't you answer with just yes/no when facing an interview? (e) Why do you greet different people differently? What have you learned so far? Share your ideas with the class. You would notice that our use of the language is strongly dependent on the context, and we always re-phrase our utterances with reference to the degree of politeness, formality and the choice of register . You continue to polish your language skills with more and more practice and thus understand its finer aspects. Good communication is always more than the correct and grammatical use of language. You also need to pay attention to accent, tone, pitch, stress, rhythm and intonation, and a demonstr ably good understanding of these aspects makes your speech INTELLIGIBLE. A3. Given below are a few phrases that we commonly use when we greet someone, and others when we conclude a conversation and bid goodbye. Separ ate the Greetings from the Goodbyes and write them in the right section of the table. Use the given clues.1151151. How would you respond to the following questions/statements? Share with your class. 1. 'Congratulations! I am so pleased to hear that.' __________________________________________________________________________ 2. Excuse me...but I really don't understand this point about the need for good connectivity'. __________________________________________________________________________ 3. 'Is this your new phone? Must have cost you a lot?' __________________________________________________________________________ 4. 'Thanks for inviting me, but I have another engagement'. __________________________________________________________________________ 5. 'I doubt if I can make it for the dinner tonight'. __________________________________________________________________________Good evening Thank you for comingHello How're you?See you tomorrow Please come againHi Good to see youSee you in a while Bye-byeGood bye Have a nice dayI need to go home Take care Greeting Goodbye Section - B Language F unctions1161162. Read some possible 'answers' and match them to the comments given in activ ity 01: 1. Thank you so much...I had to work hard for this promotion. 2. Without good connectivity , we can't download any of the big files...and that slows down our work! 3. Not really...only twelve thousand! th 4. Oh that's a pity ! Can you make it on the 18 then? 5. I can do it, only if I don't go home to change. You are possibly thinking about other options. Of course, there can be many possible responses. 3. Discuss this with your partner and write down another set of responses for activ ity 01. What does it tell you? You would have also noticed that the responses vary with reference to the context, the level of formality and also the relationship between the speaker and the listener . Here's another example to show you how the utterances can be graded starting with the least to the most formal. Lunch? Coming for lunch? Come for lunch with us? Why don't you come for lunch with us? Would you like to come to lunch with us? We would be really pleased if you could join us for lunch. Observe how the language changes with the level of formality\u2014among friends it can be a few words or phrases and with seniors and elders in formal context, the politeness is maintained along with the use of complete sentences during communication. Language Functions Understanding of different language functions and the accompanying linguistic structures is extremely helpful in developing a good proficiency of the language. A language function is the purpose of speaking that sentence or phrase. For example, \"I'm sorry\" represents the function of apologising and, \"Good Morning!\" represents the function of greeting . Please note that here the expressions like I'm sorry , or Good morning , are called exponents i.e., the language used to describe a function. Here are more language functions.\u00fd \u00fd \u00fd \u00fd \u00fd \u00fd Functions Exponents Suggesting What about going to the zoo? Let's go . Why don't we have vegetable curry?dancing117117There are many other functions like interrupting, expressing wishes/hopes/regrets, expressing obligation, interrupting, evaluating options and so on. 3. Working in pairs, complete the following table by writing Exponents for the following Functions .Inviting Could you please join us for dinner on W ednesday? Coming for coffee?th I am planning a party on the 26 . You better keep that evening free. Thanking Thank you so much for this lovely... This is just beautiful, many thanks. You made my day...it is the perfect colour and design ! Advising I'd urge you to discuss the matter with Prof Kalia. To get a clearer picture, it would be good to have a meeting with the Sales team. Under these circumstances, you certainly need to consult an advocate. Agreeing You're absolutely right! That's true. I couldn't agree more! Giving warning If you do that again, I'll leave. You had better not go there again, or else. Just wait till I get hold of you! Seeking Permission Is it OK if I go now? Please, may I use your phone? Do you mind if I bring Gopa with me? Clarifying To put it another way... If I understand you correctly... Are you saying that.... Expressing preferences On the other hand, I believe... I support Sudha's argument for allocating more funds for the School building. The Defense Counsel's arguments are well thought out, but weak on evidence. Hypothesising If I had the chance, I would... If we hadn't paid attention to what he said...Imagine you had to...would you? Functions Exponents Expressing wishes/ hopes/ regrets 118118Appropriacy and Register Imagine a Regional Manager (Sales) walks into the Meeting room and greets his or her team with, 'Hi, guys! or I'd like to wish you all a very good evening.' They would be surprised, because both of these greetings are unsuitable or inappropriate for this situation, which is neither very formal nor completely informal. And so, a simple 'Good evening' is more appropriate. The context or the situation also plays an important part in selecting the right expression, and this is called register .'Hi, guys' is an example of the informal register , and, 'A very good evening to all of you' is an example of the formal register . 4. Read the following conversation between two friends and match the italisised sentences with the functions listed. Simran: This slice of cake isn't nice. Nothing's fresh and it tastes a bit strange! Rohan : Yes, you're right. (1) Should we complain to the Manager ? Simran: (2)That's going a bit too far, isn't it? May be we could first check with the waiter . Rohan : (3)Are you saying you'd like to get this sandwich changed? Simran:No, that's not a great idea. (4) It could be possibly worse than this one. Rohan : (5)Or, could be nice and fresh! Simran: (6)OK, call the waiter and let's tell him.Expressing obligation Interrupting Evaluating options Giving an opinion Clarifying Seeking permission Summarising119119A - predicting B- making a suggestion C- asking for clarification D- expressing hope E- agreeing F- disagreeing 5.

It is important to use language precisely in such situations. Giving information and asking for information. (i) Asking a colleague, over the phone A: Hello, Aditya ! R eesha here. B: Yes, Reesha, what can I do for you ? A: Adi, can you please give me the mobile number of Mr Seth who designed the trophies last year . B: Yes, certainly . His number is-98 43 67 89 20 A: Thanks, Adi. Note: There is a very brief exchange of greetings/pleasantries and then the caller asks for the information. The respondent gives the information straightaway and that concludes the conversation. (ii) Asking your senior for information face-to-face. Aditya : Good morning, Mr Mittal. May I come in? Mr Mittal: Good morning, please come in . Adiya : Sir, I wanted to invite Mrs Sushma Shrama to the Experts' Committee meeting next week. Can you please give me her contact details?

Notice the differentiating features of these three short conversations. length of conversation formal vs informal use of language use of greetings etc. A proficient speaker bears these in mind when talking to immediate colleagues, strangers or your seniors. A good understanding of these features facilitates effective communication. On the Phone A great deal of real business in an office happens over the phone when people are calling up to find out about timings, to take appointments, to discuss something, to make enquiries about prices, timings availability and a whole range of other things and services may also often take down messages to be passed on to colleagues or seniors. In such situations, it is important that the speech is clear and effective and that the appropriate level of politeness is maintained throughout. Very often, visitors and callers complain about a service, product or a piece of information. In such situations, one has to be level-headed, speak politely , and be patient to the caller of visitors. Given below here is a table of phrases and responses that you may need to often use when talking to callers and visitors:\u00fd \u00fd \u00fd Stages Words/phr ases Appropriate is/It's...Good morning/hello. Who's calling, please? Warm up I'd like to speak to... Could you connect me to...? How are you?Just a minute/hold on, I'll put you through... Nice to hear from you. Conveying the messageI'm phoning/calling about.. Could you give B a message?I'm sorry , Z is not in. The line is busy . Would you like to hold on or call... I'll certainly pass on your message122122As you all I know that the English language has 26 letters in the alphabet, but the total number of sounds used in English is 44. In many langauges, each consonant or vowel has a unique role , a function that never changes. However , in English, different letters (both consonants and vowels) can be pronounced differently depending on where they occur in the words, and there are, sounds which are not represented by any of the 26 letters. You would have studied them in greater detail in class XI. Now, let us review these letters and sounds again. 1. Given below are the phonetic symbols along with the words which represents that sound. Read all these words aloud and circle the letter that corresponds to the phonetic symbol.Rounding off Thanks for your help. I hope to see you soon/look forward to meeting you.Thank you for calling.

Homonym: It is a word which has the same spelling and pronunciation as another word, but a different menaing. For example, 'bank' of a river and 'bank' associated with finanncial transactions. (a) Given below is a box full of words. Read each word aloud, and then find pairs of words that are pronounced in the same way, but have a different meaning and different spellings (b) Write the pairs in the table as shown below:sea blue there bye deer queue deargate sent by already tie pair dyetoo fare gait tye die practicebow cue their stationery two alreadyknot pear not whole bough stationarysee fair blew practise sent hole (e.g.) pair (e.g.) pear1251254. Stress on the right syllable A syllable is a unit of sound which includes a vowel sound. You can check how many syllables a word has by putting your hand under your chin. Each time your chin moves to make a vowel sound count a syllable. For example, the word 'difficult' moves your chin three times. Therefore, difficult has three syllables. If the word has only one syllable, that syllable is stressed, but, in multi-syllable words, the stress falls on one of the syllables while the other syllables tend to be spoken over quickly . This leads to sounds that are not clear (muted ) on unstressed syllables. In order to improve your pronunciation, focus on pronouncing the stressed syllable clearly . However , don't be afraid to \"mute\" (not say clearly ) the other unstressed vowels. (a)Study the examples and practise pronouncing the words by stressing the syllable written in capital letters. Note: Unstressed syllables keep the correct sound, but they sound muted. Sometimes, unstressed vowels become a schwa sound - like a soft \"uh\". At other times, the vowel is pronounced but not stressed. Now, review the eight common word stress patterns in English.. One Syllable - Stressed All one syllable words have the stress on the one syllable. The intonation should go down. Two Syllable - First syllable stressed Examples: Two Syllable - Second syllable stressed Examples:GIant PICture HEAtingEAT DRINK SIGN WELL toDAY aHEAD aLLOWPersonNEL TOtally InDUstrial ToMAto FanTAstic126126Three Syllable - First syllable stressed Examples: Three Syllable - Second syllable stressed Examples: Three Syllable - Third syllable stressed Examples: Four Syllable - Second syllable stressed Examples: Four Syllable - Third syllable stressed Examples: (b) Read the following sentences out aloud. Mark them as Type A or Type B according to the rise or fall in the tone. You may recall that the pitch rises at the end of the statement/question if the speaker is uncertain, and it falls when the speaker is certain. 1. The percentage of women working in banks is rising, isn't it? 2. You are not going to put this down in writing, are you? 3. The policy calls for a big change in overtime rules, doesn't it? 4. You visited Tashi last week, didn't you? 5. The Agra fort was built by Shah Jahan, wasn't it? 6. I think this will lower the recruitment standards, won't it? 7. I should go and fetch the groceries, should I? 8. I haven't read about eight different types of intelligence have you? 5.

You have tried to caution your friend about them but she/ he does not pay any heed. How will you deal with the situation?

That sounds surprising? But it is true! How do children learn a language? They only listen , and continue to listen to baby talk, the words, then phrases and sentences being spoken by all those around them, and that becomes the best stimulus for them to repeat, reproduce and eventually start speaking. They gradually start speaking in short, clear sentences and then move on to long and complex sentences. Teachers / parents. We never teach them parts of speech, sentence structures or stress patterns, but they imbibe theses finer aspects of language by simply listening and figuring out the 'rules' in their mind, that is unconsciously Listening is in not less important than reading, writing and speaking. In fact, we always do more listening than speaking, and that is the key to good communication.Section - E Listening - Rev iew 130130In fact, listening is the first skill learnt, but the last skill taught; we certainly need to pay more attention to it, and start practising listening. We listen to different conversations when we are travelling in a bus, metro or train, but you don't mind how the fellow- passengers are speaking. If they happen to be talking in English, you are likely to listen to many Indian words and phrases in their conversations, and many words being pronounced differently . Besides, there are many other unique features of such conversations like short-forms or abbreviations, some particular idioms and expressions shared by a group of people, or even words from their common dialect. This is one example of a listening situation, when we are not participating in the conversation. We are only passive listeners! There are many other situations when one needs to listen for specific information. Look at the few situations given in the pictures. At a railway station, airport or metro station, the announcements are being made continuously . But you would listen to the one which is related to your journey\u2014the key words that you listen/relate to are the arrival/departure time, destination and train or flight number . In such situations, you are listening for specific information. When you are listening to your teacher in the classroom teaching/revising a lesson, you would probably need to listen to each word carefully , to ensure that you develop a sound and comprehensive understanding of the new topic. This is also known as Intensive Listening. Sometimes, you are listening to the news, or watching a documentary on the television. During this activity , you are not listening to each and every word or may even miss out on something it happen? It happens because you are listening for general understanding i.e. to develop broad understanding of the topic being discussed. Sometimes, you don't need to listen to most of the broadcast! When does that happen? For example, when you listen to music or to a radio programme, you are listening for pleasure that is, enjoying what you are listening to becomes more 131131important than the detail of what is being spoken, narrated or discussed. Next comes inferential listening . Very often what is being spoken is not directly relevant to your situation, but may become so in the near future. The information given in these situations is not direct or explicit ,but implied. Can you think of situation when this happens? Yes especially when you don't get the answer that is expected. 1. (a) Read the following conversation: Raman: Are we going out for lunch with Meenu and Mahesh this afternoon? Simmy: It would be good idea to invite them home on Sunday , instead. Here Simmy , rather than answering in 'yes', 'no' or 'may be', suggests that they should consider inviting them home for dinner instead on Sunday . Working in pairs, discuss what meaning you could guess from her statements. Her words are only a suggestion. (i) Home food would be less expensive (ii) ....................................................................... (iii) ........................................................................ There could be other 'inferences' drawn from this short extract, while a single one can be woven into the next part of the dialogue, like the one given in the box. Raman: That's a good idea! Simmy: I can make their favourite vegetable, pulao too ! So, this is an example of inferential listening. In other words, inferential listening means that there is a difference between the meaning and the message. Here is another situation: The sales assistant at a Garments showroom may ask the customer: Are you all right? Are you OK? He is not enquiring about the customer's wellbeing, but actually saying ( implying) I am willing to help you make a selection, or I can tell you more about these new designs/products/prices etc. This is important in cross-cultural communication. 132132What they say That's not bad I almost agree I have a few minor commentsWhat they mean That's good I don't agree at all Please re-write completelyWhat others understand That's poor He's not far from agreement He has found a few mistakes/typosIt is likely that the non-native speakers may just accept the literal meaning of remarks, or statements made by native speakers of English. Look at some examples given below: You often listen to talks, lectures or presentations. What happens in such situations? Here, the objective of listening is understanding the main point and the supporting points/examples or details. As a student, you often need to practise this type of listening. 2.

Speaker 1: Many teachers have stressed opportunities that technology provides for acquiring problem- solving skills - either through instructional software designed to teach problem solving or through the many requirements for solving problems that naturally emerge when one is trying to use computer tools to accomplish a task (e.g., the selection of appropriate software, figuring out what to do when the system doesn't behave as you expect it to).Listening Script 01 Listening Script - 02 Listening Script 03135135Speaker 2: Technology helps the learner acquire complex concepts, for example by graphically representing abstract concepts such as acceleration, or by providing a structure for your thinking with tools like imp. Speaker 3: A third frequently cited rationale by teachers for introducing technology was to stimulate motivation and self-esteem. Through either personal experience or a review of the literature, many innovators perceived the dramatic effects that technology can have on students' interest in class activities and enhancing their belief in their own capabilities. While these benefits are perceived as occurring across the board, our case study sites, most of whom serve student bodies coming predominantly from lower -literacy areas - such benefits would be particularly important for these students. Speaker 4: Another good reason for using technology was the promotion of equity . In particular with the introduction of ShareNet ( the school and community intranet), a number of people easily recognized the wide disparity in the resources available to them and felt that a unifying network such as ShareNet could promote a more equitable use of those resources. In the case of several schools serving students from low-income homes, technology innovators stressed the importance of giving these students the technology tools that would facilitate the learning process, socialisation, beside encouraging children to hone their IT skills. Speaker 5: Assuming we are justified in granting access to some store of information that we may be in control of, there is a duty to ensure that that information is useful and accurate. While all searches are filtered to some degree in order to ensure that the information the search provider believes is most important to the user is listed first, not all searches are equal and it matters which search provider one uses. Host: Good morning and welcome to \"A Healthy You\"\u2014 our weekly health programme. I am your host, Pranjol Roy. Today we have with us, Dr. Arvind Dubey who is a well-known doctor of our city. Dr. Dubey practises A yurvedic medicine. Dr. Dubey , hello and welcome to our show \"A Healthy You\". Dr. Dubey: Good Morning. Host: Dr. Dubey , will you tell us something about the origin of Ayurveda? Dr. Dubey: Ayurveda is the ancient Indian medical science, the origin of which can be traced back to the Vedas. The fourth book of Vedic literature, the Atharvaveda, contains passages devoted to medicine. It was this that gave birth to Ayurveda, which literally means the science of long life. It aims to cure disease, protect health, and prolong life through natural herbs. Host: When did Ayurveda develop as a system of medicine? Dr. Dubey: Ayurveda developed between 12 to 15 century BC, about 3,500 years ago. Host: How is Ayurveda different from the other systems of medicine?Listening Script 04136136Dr. Dubey: Ayurveda comprises of two words: Ayur and Veda. Ayur means life, and Veda means knowledge or science. So the literal meaning of the word Ayurveda is the science of life. Ayurveda is a science dealing not only with the treatment of diseases but is a complete way of life. Ayurveda is the only science which deals with maintaining health and staying away from diseases. The word health here does not mean physical health, but also spiritual and mental health. Host: Thank you very much Dr. Dubey for your very enlightening talk. I am sure all of us have learnt a lot about traditional Indian medicine today .137137Sample Questions for Practice READING 1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow: 1. When I think of my school days, I am reminded of an incident which took place when I was studying in 5th class. I had a teacher , Shri Siva SubramaniaIyer . He was one of the very good teachers in our school. All of us loved to attend his class and hear him. One day, he was teaching about bird's flight. He drew a diagram of a bird on the blackboard depicting the wings, tail, body structure and the head. He explained how the birds create the lift and fly. He also explained to us how they change direction while flying. Nearly 25 minutes he gave the lecture with various information such as lift, drag, how the birds fly in a formation of 10, 20 or 30. 2. For me, it was not merely an understanding of how a bird flies. The bird's flight entered into me and created a feeling on the seashore of Rameswaram. From that evening, I thought that my future study has to be with reference to flight and flight sciences. I am telling this because my teachers teaching and the event that I witnessed later decided my future career . Then one evening after the classes, I asked the teacher . \"Sir, please let me, how to progress further in learning flight sciences.\" He patiently explained to me that I should complete high school and then I should go to college that may lead to education of flight. If I do all these I might do something connected with flight sciences. This advice and the bird flying demonstration given by my teacher really gave me a goal and a mission for my life. When I went to college, I took Physics. When I went to engineering in Madras Institute of Technology , I took Aeronautical Engineering. 3. Thus my life was transformed as a rocket engineer , aerospace engineer and technologist. That one incident of my teacher's teaching, giving a live demonstration, proved to be a turning point in my life which eventually shaped my profession. 4. How it was powered. Bird is powered by its own me and the motivation what it wants. All these things were explained to us within 15 minutes. We all understood the whole bird dynamics with practical example. How nice it was! Our teacher was a great teacher , he could give us a theoretical lesson coupled with a live demonstration. This is real teaching. I am sure many of the teachers in schools and colleges will follow this example. Pride of the Nation: Dr . A.P.J.

Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow: 1. The spiritual training of the boys was a much more difficult matter than their physical and mental training. I relied little one religious books for the training of the spirit. Of course I believed that every student should be acquainted with the elements of his own scriptures, and therefore I provided for such knowledge as best I could. But that, to my mind, was part of the intellectual training. Long before I undertook the education of the youngsters of the Tolstoy Farm I had realized that the training of the spirit was a thing by itself. To develop the spirit is to build character and to enable one to work towards knowledge of God and self-realization. And I held that this was an essential part of the training of the young, and that all training without culture of the spirit was of no use, and might be even harmful. I am familiar with the superstition that self-realization is possible only in the fourth stage of life, i.e., sannyasa (renunciation). But it is a matter of common knowledge that those who defer preparation for this invaluable experience until the last stage of life attain not self- realization but old age amounting to a second and pitiable childhood, lying as a burden on this earth. I have a full recollection that I held these views even while I was teaching i.e., in 1911-12, though I might not then have expressed them in identical language. 2. How then was this spiritual training to be given? I made the children memorize and recite hymns, and read to them books on moral training. But that was far from satisfying me. As I came into closer contact with them I was that it was not through books that one could impart training of the spirit. Just as physical training was to be imparted through physical exercise, and intellectual through intellectual exercise, even so the training of the spirit was possible only through the exercise of the spirit. And the exercise of the spirit entirely depended on the life and character of the teacher . The teacher had always to be mindful of his p's and q's, whether he was in the midst of his boys or not. 3. It is possible for a teacher situated miles away to affect the spirit of the pupils by his way of living. It would be idle for me, if I were a liar, to teach boys to tell the truth. A cowardly teacher would never succeed in making his boys valiant, and a stranger to self-restraint could never teach his pupils the value of self-restraint. I saw, therefore, that I must be an eternal object-lesson to the boys and girls living with me. They thus became my teachers, and I learnt I must be good and live straight, if only for their sakes. I may say that the increasing discipline and restraint I imposed on myself at Tolstoy Farm was mostly due to those wards of mine. 4. One of them was wild, unruly , given to lying, and quarrelsome. On one occasion he broke out most violently . I was exasperated. I never punished my boys, but this time I was angry . 140140I tried to reason with him. But he was adamant and even tried to overreach me. At last I picked up a ruler lying at hand and delivered a blow on his arm. I trembled as I struck him. I dare say he noticed it. This was an entirely novel experience for them all. The boy cried out and begged to be forgiven. He cried not because the beating was painful to him; he could, if he had been so minded, have paid me back in the same coin, being a stoutly built youth of seventeen; but he realized my pain in being driven to this violent resource. Never again after this incident did he disobey me. But I still repent that violence. I am afraid I exhibited before him and day not the spirit, but the brute, in me. 5. I have always been opposed to corporal punishment. I remember only one occasion on which I physically punished one of my sons. I have therefore never until this day been able to decide whether I was right or wrong in using the ruler. Probably it was improper , for it was prompted by anger and a desire to punish. Had it been an expression only of my distress, I should have considered it justified. But the motive in this case was mixed. 6. This incident set me thinking and taught me a better method of correcting students. I do not know whether that method would have availed on the occasion in question. The youngster soon forgot the incident, and I do not think he ever showed great improvement. But the incident made me understand better the duty of a teacher towards his pupils. 7. Cases of misconduct on the part of the boys often occurred after this, but I never resorted to corporal punishment. Thus in my endeavor to impart spiritual training to the boys and girls under me, I came to understand better and better the power of the spirit.

The hair, like the skin, is a barometer to the state of your internal health. If you are generally healthy and have a balanced diet, you will most probably find that your hair reflects it. On the other hand, illness, tension and deficiencies can affect hair and give rise to various problems. Hair is fed by blood flowing to the hair follicles, and this means that a good circulation is necessary for healthy hair. For this reason, the daily diet is of great importance and so are normal living habits. At some time or other , most of us are confronted with hair problems. One of the most common among these is dandruff, which can trigger off other problems like hair loss or acne. 2. Dandruff is a scalp disease. Some forms of dandruff can cause severe itching and when one scratches the scalp to relieve itching, further damage is caused. Any damage to the scalp 142142with the nails can cause secondary bacterial infections. All these put together give rise to a more serious problem, accelerating hair loss and undermining the health of serious problem, accelerating hair loss and undermining the health of the hair. Dandruff as well as other bacterial and fungal infections of the scalp can be cured, but very often people get resigned to living with mild forms of dandruff and overlook the necessity of having it treated. 3. What one needs to know is not only how to cure it but also how to tackle the problem in all its aspects. The object is to restore health to the scalp, and by doing so, to the hair itself. If you bring about a change in your diet and living habits, consume more fresh foods and drink plenty of water , you will be tackling the problem at the grass roots. 4. Treatment with herbal extracts has been found to be extremely effective. A number of herbs have appropriate medicinal properties that can control infection. They also help to stimulate their growth and are so mild in nature that there is no damage to delicate tresses. In fact, this is one factor which is a definite advantage, as many dandruff treatments are very harsh on the hair and finally leave it dry, and brittle. 5. Side by side with clinical treatments, a course of treatment is given for daily use, at home. This creates an awareness of the right way of taking daily care of hair. Herbs like henna, shikakai, reetha and amla are antiseptic ingredients provided by nature and have a wonderful cleansing action, without the harmful effects of detergents. 6. Light oil massage often helps to dislodge the dandruff flakes, though there is myth about the effectiveness of head massage. In actuality , when there is hair loss, a vigorous massage can cause more hair to fall, as the roots are already weak. Besides, it can damage the hair shaft. Hair is very delicate and should be handled very gently . The scalp should be massaged gently . The finger tips should be used to move the skin of the scalp in small circulatory movements. 7. For dandruff, a light massage with hot oil helps to rid the scalp of the flakes. Pure coconut oil or olive oil can be heated and applied on the scalp with a gentle massage at night. It should be left on overnight. Next morning the juice of one lemon should be applied an hour before shampooing. This can be a good weekly treatment for the scalp. 8. Henna is a natural product that also helps to control dandruff infections. However , one has to be very careful about the quality of henna that is used. Specially prepared henna powder , mixed with other ingredients, is effective in controlling dandruff and improving the texture of the hair. 9. Henna promotes hair growth, restores health and also conditions hair to a luxuriant, shiny, soft texture. It has an effective cleansing action, getting rid of toxic wastes that accumulate on the scalp, inhibiting natural hair growth. 10. These treatments help to create an 'acid mantle' on the scalp. The skin and scalp are normally acid and flourish in an acid medium.143143Do as directed: (i) Make notes on the passage given above using recognizable abbreviations. Give a suitable title to the passage. (ii) Write a summary on the notes you have made in about 80-100 words. 4. Read the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow . 1. A dancer needs to remain fit at all times. Your health can mean the world to you, so it becomes important that you take good care of what and how much you consume. A dancer's diet changes with the intensity of his/her rehearsals or practices. Often, when I meet aspiring dancers and dance enthusiasts, they keep asking me diet-related questions. For a dancer , diet goes hand in hand with how we look, feel, and perform. But, how do we find out what's best for our body? We often get nutrition advice from our friends, family , teachers, studio owners, magazines, the Internet etc. Unfortunately , a few dancers have across to a professional nutrition expert, who understands the dancer's special dietary needs. I recently happened to bump into my old nutritionist friend Pooja Bhargava, who has now opened here own consultancy F.U.N. in Mumbai. We sat down and chatted for old time sake; that is when I mentioned to advice dancers on the right diet. She helped me write this piece today . 2. DO's Eat a well-balanced diet of three meals, plus two-three healthy snacks per day . Include plenty of fruits and vegetables, nuts, low fat dairy or calcium-fortified products, lean meat, fish or vegetarian alternatives like soya, vegetable protein and whole grains. Our bodies and brains run on fuel called glucose, which is another word for \"sugar\". In the morning, our fuel supply is low and needs to be replenished. A light breakfast that includes a starch, dairy, or fruit will bring glucose levels up and give you the energy you need to start the day. Taking a daily multi-vitamin with minerals is important, it's not always easy to get all the nutrients we need in a day. As a safe backup, taking a standard daily multi-vitamin with minerals ensures that you are getting the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), or the amount scientific research has found to be safe and adequate for all healthy people, including athletes and dancers! Drink water throughout the day to maintain adequate hydration. Limit your intake of protein and energy drinks. Snack carefully says Pooja: it is okay to have snacks once in a while when access to less processed whole foods isn't available. Plan ahead: For instance, a peanut or almond, cashew , soyanut, etc. butter sandwich on whole wheat bread provide comparable nutrition and is far less expensive. 3. DON'T s Remember eating less will make you lose weight. In fact, under eating can slow your metabolism, deplete your energy level, and increase body fat storage. If you find it difficult to eat before dance class, have at least a light snack of, for example, fruit and yogurt or crackers and hummus. After class, have another snack - perhaps a half or whole-144144nut butter , peanut, cashew , almond, tahini, soynut sandwich and fresh or dried fruit or trail mix. Some dancers overdo supplements, so be careful: taking too much of an individual vitamin or mineral supplement may do your body more harm than good by interfering with your body's normal metabolism. Eating a well-balanced diet can provide all the essential vitamins and minerals your body needs. Do not drink a lot of soda, diet soda, or beverages during dance breaks. Both can deplete amounts of certain nutrients in your body. Excess soda intake affects bone health, while in excess of one or two servings per day can potentially harm the body in a number of ways. According to Pooja, relying on supplemental foods to replace regular meals or between meal snacks is also a bad idea. Many are high in sugar and calories; some contain high amounts of sugar making them low carbon that can create discomfort such as stomach upset, bloating gas, etc. Hope all you dance love and dancers find those tips handy .
