A broad definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (The World Health Organisation, n.d.). Expanding on this definition it is important to address the variable similarities of CAM modalities. CAM therapies across the various modalities have in common a shared, in varying degrees, holistic approach and subscribe to some form of vitality - a contrast from the science-based view point of conventional medicine prevalent in western society. In spite of CAM therapies empirical nature and efficacies, it is suggested that dissatisfaction of conventional medicine underpins the popularity it has garnered, thus, it will be examined further as to how and why. A further discussion will be made to related dangers of both alternative and science-based medicine; providing an opportunity to constructively educate the public on the differences between the two systems. Throughout the years there have been two traditions within the practice of medicine. One is the 'art of healing ' which involves its own specialised brand of training. The art of healing is dependent on the prescriber 's foreknowledge and the clients' viewpoint of the prosperous results. The 'Science of healing ' is based on scientific and technological ideas. This tradition results in a lower liability for practitioners regarding the showing of an original approach to medicine, however the results of this method are more calculable (Kayne 2002). It is believed that the tradition of the 'art of healing' is increasing in popularity. The World Health Organisation states ' 'that the terms ' 'complementary medicine ' ' or ' 'alternative medicine' ' are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country 's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system\" (World Health Organization 2000). This type of treatment, is commonly known as 'Complementary and alternative medicine' (CAM). The word complementary derives from the meaning 'together with' established practices and the word alternative refers to 'in place' of established practices. Some patients choose to participate in complementary therapies along with the medication prescribed by their general practitioner whilst others prefer complementary therapies as opposed to the medications Today we have alternative medicine which was developed thousands of years ago and have a long-standing historical value of effectiveness, advantages, and some drawbacks. Diagnosis was the first approach to any illness. Alternative medicine looks at the factors of equilibrium and the environment in which one lives and the disease is considered an imbalance between the two; cleansing the whole body than on a particular problem to get the balance back in sync. Very much the description of the Buddhist and the Greek cultures of medicine and healing the Chem 253 - Organic Chemistry I Lab 10: Isolation of Identification of the major constituent of clove oil 3/15/2012 Purpose: The purpose of this lab was to isolate the cove oil from ground cloves and determine the identity of the major constituent that is known to have the molecular formula C10H12O2 through IR As complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) grows more popular with the American public, the question arises whether we should consolidate aspects of unorthodox medicine with standard care. Many, such as Dr. Andrew Weil, swear by CAM's effectiveness and urge for a more patient-centered approach to care (Relman). While CAM has no shortage of critics, a growing body of research is indicating the effectiveness of many CAM therapies in treating a variety of conditions. Patients, physicians, and researchers sometimes find that CAM therapies are more Through the enthusiasm of alternative medicine by patients, the health and social care sector comes across to:\" ethical issues of efficacy, training, competence and patient safety, \"according to (Nursing times ,2005). Therefore, it is important to understand the principles behind complementary therapies and their usage. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a term that describes health and wellness therapies that have not been part of conventional medicine. Complementary treatments is with conventional medicine, and alternative treatments is used in place of conventional medicine. It can include treatments and therapies such as massage, natural products, meditation, yoga, vitamin supplements, herbs, chiropractic, acupuncture, and lots more. But problems arise when CAM is questioned if it scientifically helps patients overcome a disease. Is there really health benefits? Are some of the products natural? Do they come with risks? These are questions that can be asked when looking into CAM. Benefits of Alternative Medicine Alternative medicine believes in supporting the natural healing processes of the body. This means that helps a better functioning of organs, for example, it does not destroy the liver function, such as pharmaceutical products do. It means allowing the body to regulate their own cholesterol, blood pressure and brain chemistry in a healthy way of support. 177). Garcia-Escamilla, Rodriguez-Martin, and Martinez-Vizcaino (2016) found that \"some recent evidences support the benefits of acupuncture integration into conventional medicine setting, particularly improvements in physical and emotional symptoms, increased quality of life levels and reduction of drug side effects\" (p. 178). Acupuncture can easily be considered supplemental or complementary to Western medicine in that acupuncture provides a service that Western medicine does not offer (Garcia-Escamilla, Rodriguez-Martin, & Martinez-Vizcaino, 2016, p. 195). Offering or remaining open to alternative therapies may help improve relationships between provider and patient by providing the feeling that the physician is not giving up and is willing into look into a full breadth of treatment options (AAMA, Complementary and alternative therapies are very large group of non-orthodox therapies that may be used alone or with other non-orthodox and orthodox therapies. This term (CAM) is applied to over 700 different therapies. Some relaxation techniques, massage therapies, special diets and self-help groups could be considered to be lifestyle rather than true therapies, also it can be considered as actions that enhanced the feeling of Complementary medicine is treatments that are used together but are not considered to be standard treatments. Alternative medicine is treatments that are used instead of standard medical treatments. Another term used interchangeably with CAM is home remedies. Eating a peanut-butter sandwich and drinking a glass of warm milk for insomnia or putting sugar/honey on minor cuts or scrapes are just some of the forms of this. Throughout history, people of various cultures have practiced CAM, or what they called it, Western medicine. Some therapies are far outside the accepted Western practice, but some are now established in mainstream and accepted forms of medicine and have been used for centuries worldwide. Holistic Medicine Holistic Medicine, commonly referred to as \"Alternative Medicine\", is a vast and rapidly growing new scientific field. It is derived mainly from ancient, traditional methods of healing that have often been practiced in the East for centuries. These include a variety of techniques from herbal healing to acupuncture to homeopathy to energy channeling. Due to the large number of methods that are covered by the term, there are various definitions of Holistic Medicine. However, all literature seems to agree that Alternative Medicine, is exactly what the name suggests: an 'alternative' approach to healing and medicine. It is a more personal move toward health care, which attempts to connect the mind, body and spirit. However, what if chronic back pain could be managed by adding alternative therapies such as yoga to modern treatments? Yoga is an additional therapy that decreases chronic back pain by promoting movement and decreasing pain medication dependence (Lee, Crawford & Schoomaker, 2014). This could radically reduce the dependence on drugs for pain relief and lead to a movement where pain is managed with the help of both modern medicine and affordable alternative remedies. With this in mind, promoting alternative therapies, such as yoga, in collaboration with modern treatments provides a larger range of options with different efficiencies for those with chronic back pain. By examining some of the most popular, enduring alternative medical systems, one can begin to see some general trends of the systems, understand some recurring flaws, and understand the attraction and usefulness of alternative medicine in today's health care system. However, alternative medicine remains controversial. Whether it can be supported scientifically or not, alternative medicine may be useful to encourage both physical and mental well-being via a placebo effect. For this reason, alternative medicine must be considered by physicians as a complement to modern medicine. These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
