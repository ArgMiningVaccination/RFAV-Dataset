Natural State Recovery offers all levels of care. Premium care. Beautiful facilities. Close to home. If unhealthy behaviors have become addictions, and life has become unmanageable, it's natural to feel hopelessness and despair. It's also time to make a fundamental decision: \"Am I willing to accept help?\" Natural State Recovery Centers (NSRC), based in Central Arkansas, offers an effective three-pronged program combining inpatient detox/outpatient addiction treatment for men and women, enhanced sober living for men and women, and life skills training. An important part of our rehabilitation program is that we provide these and other necessary tools for our clients' lasting recovery. The Natural State Recovery Centers team is more than simply professionals. In fact, most of our team members can personally relate to our patients by virtue of having gone through the ongoing process of recovery, themselves. We know what works and we know what doesn't work. This experience has helped shape our program into one that begins simply with hope, then evolves into a transformative life-changing experience for the client. To provide individuals in the early stages of recovery a structured, disciplined, and loving environment while attending treatment. Combining medical and recovery services to build a solid foundation for a complete transformation. Focusing on four aspects of a person's spiritual, mental, physical, and emotional well-being in order to create a life worth living. At NSRC, we know how difficult and dangerous addiction can be for sufferers and their families, which is why we provide all-inclusive care so you can avoid the pain that addiction can cause. One of the services we provide is detoxification, or detox, that can help you if you can't stop using drugs long enough to join a treatment program. Our detox services can help your body rid itself of harmful substances and prepare you to fully participate in therapy and other treatments. In residential rehab, our clients receive intensive treatment for drug and alcohol addiction and live onsite at our rehabilitation facilities. Residential stents can be short - often lasting just days or weeks. We provide 24-hour care administered by a talented team to provide the support and care needed during the most critical moments of recovery. Adults participating in NSRC's Outpatient Program receive treatment for substance use disorders several days a week while still having the opportunity to work, attend school, volunteer or participate in other activities that help them maintain a healthy, independent lifestyle. Outpatient Treatment is open to both adult males and females and involves tried-and-true approaches to addiction treatment. Transitioning from rehabilitation treatment back to life in the community is the most vulnerable period for a recovering addict. NSRC provides a secure, stable environment where people can continue to practice their coping skills in a drug-free environment. Our ultimate goal is to instill healthy and sustainable habits, resulting in positive changes in body, mind, and spirit. Maintaining the coping skills learned in rehab is imperative to building healthy, fulfilling lives after graduating from our program. "}
