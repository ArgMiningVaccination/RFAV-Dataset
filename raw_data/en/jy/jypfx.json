Owned and operated since 2009 by Dr. Jennifer Means. Singing River provides excellent, effective, and affordable natural health care for the entire family. At Singing River, we recognize that healing means more than alleviating symptoms. We consider the mental, emotional, and spiritual as well as the physical aspects of our patients' lives to discover and address the root causes of illness. From the moment you walk in the doors, we offer a place of great warmth, compassion, and respect. We work as a team with our patients to uncover obstacles to health and work to optimize their vitality through a variety of modalities including nutrition, acupuncture, botanical medicine, homeopathy, detoxification strategies, intravenous and injection therapies, and even pharmaceuticals when it is indicated. COVID Updates In these fickle times of COVID, with constantly changing policies, mandates, and infection rates, it is hard to know what the best course of action is to take in order to protect our patients and ourselves. Singing River takes the risk of COVID seriously. We also recognize that access to quality healthcare is vital to the physical and mental well-being of our patients. Because we continue to live in uncertain times, you must wear your mask when entering the clinic, regardless of your immunization status. We also ask that you respect social distancing and handwashing protocols and if you are someone who requires a companion to accompany you to an appointment, that you limit it to one person. Please do not come into the clinic if you have been exposed to COVID if you have a fever or are feeling acutely ill. We will continue to have telehealth appointments available for those who are not able to meet the above requirements.
