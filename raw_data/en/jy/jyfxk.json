This project is a continuation of the previous project supported by MAHLE with the objective of strengthening evidence-based traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TBCM) in the country with a focus on anthroposophical medicine. The Brazilian Academic Consortium for Integrative Health has proved to be a powerful tool for social transformation in a scenario of great resistance, filling a gap of representation, endorsement and co-construction of medicine beyond the restricted interests in synthetic medicines and high-tech equipment. For Anthroposophy, the elaboration of the HTA - (International State of the Art Dossier on Research in Anthroposophical Medicine and Therapies) would be a reference document to be published in German, English and Portuguese, and disseminated with PAHO/WHO support to all countries.
