[View Daniel J Bell's current disclosures](/users/doctordj?lang=us) [see full revision history and disclosures](/articles/hypervitaminosis-d/revisions?lang=us) Hypervitaminosis D (also known as vitamin D toxicity (VDT)) is very rare, and is usually secondary to exogenous administration of megadoses of [vitamin D](/articles/vitamin-d?lang=us) over long periods. Clinically it manifests as the clinical [sequelae](/articles/sequela-1?lang=us) of chronic [hypercalcemia](/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=hypercalcaemia&lang=us). On this page: Epidemiology Incidence is unknown, however recent interesting work suggests it is much rarer than historically used to be thought 2. Clinical presentation Symptoms and signs of hypervitaminosis D tend to be related to the hypercalcemia and overt presentations are rare: - neuropsychiatric: coma - degree heart block](/articles/heart-block?lang=us) - renal: [polyuria](/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=polyuria&lang=us), dehydration, [nephrocalcinosis](/articles/nephrocalcinosis?lang=us), and failure [hypertension](/articles/hypertension?lang=us) of Pathology Markedly elevated serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) are key to the pathogenesis of vitamin D toxicity. Historically it was thought that as 25-hydroxyvitamin D rose, the hypercalcemia manifested itself in step, however recent work suggests that in most people normocalcaemia persists, even in the face of a severely elevated serum 25(OH)D 2. Dosing of up to 20,000 IU per day seems to be safe in adult men 1,3. Etiology Vitamin D toxicity is rare and usually requires persistently large doses over a considerable duration. Most cases are [iatrogenic](/articles/iatrogenic?lang=us) and related to exogenous megadosing. Interestingly prolonged sunlight exposure does not result in hypervitaminosis D, as homeostatic mechanisms in the skin mean that unneeded vitamin D is metabolized to the inactive metabolites tachysterol and lumisterol 1. Endogenous causes are usually to [granulomatous disease](/articles/granuloma?lang=us), in which the involved macrophages overproduce vitamin D2. The congenital disease [idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia](/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=idiopathic-infantile-hypercalcaemia&lang=us) may result in vitamin D toxicity because the underlying genetic defect means that the body cannot degrade active vitamin D. Exogenous - chronic megadose supplementation of - fungal diseases - subcutaneous fat necrosis - giant cell polymyositis - berylliosis - - malignancy Radiographic features Radiological appearances of vitamin D toxicity generally are due to the subsequent hypercalcemia, e.g. [nephrocalcinosis](/articles/nephrocalcinosis?lang=us), [peptic ulcer disease](/articles/peptic-ulcer-disease?lang=us), and [acute pancreatitis](/articles/acute-pancreatitis?lang=us). Treatment and prognosis - immediate cessation of any vitamin D supplements - intravenous sodium chloride ameliorates the deleterious renal effects - steroid administration reduces hypercalcemia by decreasing GI absorption of calcium - bisphosphonates might be required to resolve a high hypercalcemia References - 1.
