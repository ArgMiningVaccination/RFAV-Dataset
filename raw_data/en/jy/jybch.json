Gender indicators Key ABS economic and social indicators measuring equality between males and females, including gender pay gap and life expectancy Key Indicators Gender pay gap measures [ ](/statistics/labour/earnings-and-working-conditions/average-weekly-earnings-australia/may-2023) Mean weekly ordinary time cash earnings 11.9% Full-time adult employees Source: Average Weekly Earnings May 2023 Gender pay gap indicator notes The gender pay gap is the difference in the earnings of men and women, expressed as a proportion of men's earnings. Analysing the gender pay gap is complex and there is no single measure that can provide a complete picture. For further information, please see [Gender pay gap guide](/statistics/understanding-statistics/guide-labour-statistics/gender-pay-gap-guide). The two key ABS sources of data for these measures are [Employee Earnings and Hours](/statistics/labour/earnings-and-working-conditions/employee-earnings-and-hours-australia/latest-release) (EEH), which is published every 2 years; and [Average Weekly Earnings](/statistics/labour/earnings-and-working-conditions/average-weekly-earnings-australia/latest-release) (AWE), published every 6 months. Presented are four ABS indicators that provide a high-level snapshot of the gender pay gap. 1. Median hourly cash earnings (EEH) - generally the smallest gender pay gap 2. Mean hourly cash earnings (EEH) 3. Median weekly cash earnings (EEH) 4. Mean weekly cash earnings (AWE) - generally the largest gender pay gap. In addition, the following ABS indicators, based on the ordinary time earnings of full-time adult employees are also presented: 5. Mean weekly ordinary time earnings of full-time adult employees (AWE) - the commonly cited measure of the gender pay gap. 6. Mean weekly ordinary time cash earnings of full-time adult employees (AWE) - the 'cash earnings' equivalent of the traditionally cited measure, which includes amounts salary sacrificed. Median - The median is the most representative measure of the average earnings of employees. - The median is the midpoint of the earnings distribution where half of people earn more than the median earnings value and half earn less than the median earnings value. Mean - The mean is total earnings divided by the number of employees. - Mean earnings show a positive skew, caused by a small number of people earning much higher incomes. This is more evident in male than female earnings. Hourly - Hourly measures provide a common period for comparison, removing the effect of differences in hours worked. - Males work more paid hours each week, on average, than females. Weekly - Weekly measures are affected by differences in paid hours worked and work patterns. - Almost half of all employed females work part-time. - Based on mean weekly ordinary time earnings of full-time adult employees from AWE. These measures exclude part-time employees and overtime earnings. The commonly cited measure also excludes amounts salary sacrificed. For further information, see [Gender pay gap guide](/statistics/understanding-statistics/guide-labour-statistics/gender-pay-gap-guide). Data Source: [Employee Earnings and Hours](/statistics/labour/earnings-and-working-conditions/employee-earnings-and-hours-australia/latest-release) (published and unpublished) and [Average Weekly Earnings](/statistics/labour/earnings-and-working-conditions/average-weekly-earnings-australia/latest-release). - AWE cash earnings (including salary sacrifice) series is available from May 2010. - Excludes amounts salary sacrificed.
