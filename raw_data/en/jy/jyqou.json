The power of a crystal grid comes from the combination of crystals, sacred geometry and personal intention. When a crystal grid is created, the metaphysical properties of the selected items become energetically connected. They work together to amplify or transmute energies of a space. Chakra is a Sanskrit word that means wheel. It refers to the energy centers found in the body. Most Eastern traditions describe seven major Chakras positioned along the midline of the body from the base of the spine to the crown of the head.
