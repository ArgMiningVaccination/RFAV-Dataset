ArianePosted 6 months ago on BookRetreatsNot recommended Expensive and not great. Yoga was ok but not impressive, meditation was limited, the venue was cold, and pictures on the website were very misleading. The competence of staff, underwhelming. LaurencePosted a year ago on BookRetreatsFirst retreat experience I had always been intrigued by going on a retreat and life had been challenging (illness in family, work strife, general struggles of living in modern society). I went on this retreat due to the location and cost (both were spot on). No solution was \"offered\". The peaceful environment combined with clean food and excellent guided meditation and yoga sessions allowed me to take a break and engage in introspection. From this retreat, I reconnected with myself and subsequently the world around me. The staff did not push anything on to guests, instead a wonderful environment was created that catalysed deep reflection. This was my first retreat and I couldn't have asked for a better experience! JudePosted 5 months ago on BookRetreatsOk but very poor value I wanted to destress and refocus on myself and also get some advice about managing my skin ( I have an auto immune condition that has flared up). I liked that it included yoga and Ayurveda. Also the very flexible dates. And the fact life coaching was offered. Helped to think about yoga. The life coaching was ok and challenged my thinking. The retreat fulfilled the promise to the minimum. Different people had booked different retreats eg Buddhism or weight loss but there was not much difference ( or any in the case of Buddhism which one lady had booked and no mention was made of it). As soon as you arrived somebody tried to sell you some stuff which I didn't like. Things were promised but not really delivered or delivered to a bare minimum for example a cookery lesson was watching somebody making your supper for that night. The promised nature walk were you going for a walk without even giving a guide or path ( I found some in the library later). It felt that things were scrimped on to make money. For example, the curry was mostly noodles with a tiny bit of sauce. I had paid extra for a private bathroom but it was down the corridor which wasn't great at night. There was no fridge in the guest kitchen and we had to ask for milk and there was never enough. The heating was turned off in the middle of the day despite the fact it was snowing. The yoga was good if you were experienced ( I am) but little adaptation or explanation was offered to those who weren't. I've been on retreats before and I would not come back here. I felt ripped off really. The teacher was nice. KarenPosted 10 months ago on BookRetreatsA little disappointed The best part of the two day retreat was meeting the other ladies and the food. I was disappointed that majority of the time the heating was not on in the farmhouse. It was October and we all were walking around the house cold with blankets around us. The Yoga room was really cold also. I am only just getting over a two-week cold which I believe I got from being in the farm house. They have a good foundation to work with they just need to make it more comfortable and inviting for people staying. Maybe have fresh fruit juice available etc. In the small kitchen, we could help ourselves to herbal or black tea. Nothing else. There was no sugar, coffee, milk etc. Just the 3 meals a day, no snacking. So it's almost like you are doing a detox. Great if you were expecting it but not if you weren't and then on top of that, a cold house. Best price guarantee.Hosts must offer the lowest price to be listed on our site.
