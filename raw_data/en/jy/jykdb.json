Vaccination can also make these diseases milder, particularly whooping cough. Protection against some of the diseases may wear off over time so children need boosters at four to six years of age and 14 to 16 years of age. Vaccine Brands: Pediacel\u00ae It is recommended that all infants receive Pediacel\u00ae vaccine at two, four, six and 18 months of age.

Nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, generalized body aches and sore or swollen joints may occur however are not as common. Allergic reactions, (which may include difficulty breathing, wheezing, hives and rash), and neurologic reactions are rare and in some instances severe. Report any side effects or severe vaccine reactions to your health care provider. Diphtheria is a serious bacterial disease of the throat, nose and skin. Infection can cause breathing problems, heart failure, and nerve damage. It is easily spread by coughing and sneezing and direct contact with an infected person. Diphtheria kills up to 10 per cent of people who get the disease. Today, diphtheria is rare due to immunization. Tetanus or lockjaw is a rare and often fatal disease that occurs when the tetanus bacteria gets into a deep cut in the skin. Tetanus causes severe cramping of the muscles, particularly in the jaw, neck and abdomen. Tetanus bacteria are found everywhere including soil, dust and animal manure and can survive for long periods in the soil. Whooping cough can infect people of any age but is most dangerous for babies. Infection can spread from coughing and sneezing from an infected person. Pertussis may cause violent coughing lasting for weeks. Vomiting, difficulty breathing, seizures and even brain damage may result. Pneumonia may occur in children. Polio is a disease of the spinal cord that can cause nerve damage and paralyze the muscles used for breathing, talking, eating and walking. It is spread when people drink water or eat food with the polio virus in it. Polio is also spread from person to person. Wild polio virus has been eliminated in Canada due to vaccination. However, poliovirus is still found in other parts of the world and can be re-introduced to Toronto through travel or migration. The Hib bacteria can spread from child to child through coughing and sneezing and can be carried in the nose and throat without symptoms in some people. Children under five years of age are most at risk. Bacteria can infect the lining of the brain and spinal cord. It can also cause pneumonia and infection of the joints, middle ear and lining of the heart. Talk to your doctor or call our Immunization Line "}
