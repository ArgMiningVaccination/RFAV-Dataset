Author disclosure: No relevant financial relationships. After the initial approval of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for adults, pneumococcal immunization recommendations became increasingly complex. [1](#afp20220600p580-b1), [2](#afp20220600p580-b2) In 2015, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that all individuals 65 years or older receive the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13; polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax 23). However, subsequent analysis showed that herd immunity from childhood PCV13 vaccination made the vaccine less necessary in older adults. [2](#afp20220600p580-b2) As a result, the 2019 guidelines recommended shared decision-making about PCV13 for patients 65 years or older followed by PPSV23. [2](#afp20220600p580-b2) Many primary care physicians may find it impractical to have this nuanced discussion with so many other preventive care and chronic disease management topics to address in a typical office visit. In addition, risk-based approaches to pneumococcal vaccination in younger adults have been complex and may be a contributing factor to suboptimal uptake in this population. Prior risk-based approaches included different recommendations for patients with immunosuppressing or chronic medical conditions. With the 2021 approval of PCV15 (Vaxneuvance) and PCV20 (Prevnar 20), the ACIP has greatly simplified pneumococcal vaccination recommendations.

The only difference is that for the combination regimen, clinicians may shorten the interval between doses to eight weeks when a patient has an immunocompromising condition.
