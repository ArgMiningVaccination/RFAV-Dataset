As part of the new IRS requirements, hospitals must conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) to serve as an essential tool for developing a health improvement plan for the community the hospital serves. A community health needs assessment poises hospitals as leaders who have identified the health needs of their communities and are working towards solutions to meet those needs. The statutory requirements specified in the Affordable Care Act state: Each hospital facility must conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment at least once every three tax years and adopt an implementation strategy to meet the community health needs identified through the assessment The Community Health Needs Assessment must take into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community serviced by the hospital facility; including those with special knowledge of or expertise in public health Must be made widel y available to the public Each hospital must disclose in Form 990 how it is addressing all of the needs identified in the assessment and if not, why not A CHNA serves as a systematic approach to collecting, analyzing and utilizing data to identify priority areas for improving health. Hospitals use this report as a call to action, engaging community members through public awareness messages, creating effective programs and policies and collaborating with other organizations to bring positive change to their community. The long -term goal of a CHNA is to identify health priorities and develop impact strategies with all health -related stakeholders in the community. COMMUNITY HEAL TH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS This CHNA is the continuation of UF Health Central Flori da's dedication to community health assessment work. UF Health Central Florida (formerly known as Central Florida Health) is a not -for-profit family of hospitals including UF Health Leesburg Hospital and The Villages \u00ae Hospital. A separate CHNA was completed for each hospital. UF Health Central Florida engaged the services of WellFlorida Council to complete the 20 21-2022 Community Health Needs Assessment for The Villages \u00ae Hospital and UF Health Leesburg Hospital. This report serves as the CHNA for the UF Health Leesburg Hospital Service Area. WellFlorida Council is the statutorily designated (F.S. 408.033) local health council that serves north central Florida, including the U F Health Central Florida Service Areas of L ake, Marion and Sumter C ounties along with thirteen other counties. The mission of WellFlorida Council is to forge partnerships in planning, research and service that UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY , AND INTRODUCTION | PAGE 5 build healthier communities. WellFlorida achieves this mission by providing communities the insights, tools, and services necessary to identify their most pressing issues (e.g. , community health assessments and community health improvement plans) and to design and implement approaches to overcoming those issues. The UF Health Central Florida Steering Committee and WellFlorida based the 20 21-2022 CHNA effort on a nationally recognized model and best practice for completing health assessments and improvement plans called Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP). The MAPP to ol was developed by the National Association of C ounty and C ity Health Officials (NACCHO) in cooperation with the Public Health Practice Program Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). NACCHO and CDC's vision for implementing MAPP is: \"Communities achieving improved health and quality of life by mobilizing partnerships and taking strategic action.\" At the heart of the MAPP process are the four core MAPP assessments. These are: Community Health Status Assessment Community Themes and Stre ngths Assessment Forces of Change Assessment (conducted as a combined Visioning and Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) discussion) Local Public Health System Assessment (LPHSA)* These four MAPP assessments work in concert to identify common themes and considerations in order to hone in on key community health needs. The results of three of the MAPP assessments are integrated into the 20 21-2022 CHNA. Please note, this document is a health needs assessment and its purpose is to uncover or substantiate the health needs and health issues in the service area. This report will not establish priority goals and objectives for addressing these issues or create a strategic plan for achieving those goals and objectives. These are the next phases of the MAPP process referred to as the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) or implementation plan . *The LPHSA was omitted from this process given that it is typically completed and facilitated by the local health department. The LPHSA measures how we ll the local public health system (county -level) delivers the 10 Essential Public Health Services. Each county health department should complete the LPHSA every five years. In addition, the MAPP framework is undergoing revisions that will substitute an updated capacity assessment that will be available in the future. The UF Health Leesburg Hospital Service Area includes five (5) zip codes from Lake County, one (1) zip code from Marion County , and four (4) zip codes from Sumter County. The Lake County zip codes are 34748 and 34788 Leesburg, 34731 Fruitland Park, 32159 Lady Lake, and 32778 Tavares. The Marion County zip code is Summerfield 34491 and the Sumter County zip codes include The V illages, 34785 Wildwood, and 33513 Bushnell. The zip code areas chosen were based on the top 75 percent of discharges UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY , AND INTRODUCTION | PAGE 6 from the hospital during the 20 20 fiscal year. The six -month assessment process began in November 2021 and concluded in April 2022. ORGA NIZATION OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT REPORT The 2021-2022 UF Health Leesburg Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment is comprised of the following main sections: Introduction to Community Health Needs Assessments: This section includes an overview of the CHNA process; description of the organization of the CHNA report; insights on using the CHNA; and a brief synopsis of the common themes and considerations identified in the needs assessment. Community Health Status: Detailed in this section are demographic and socioeconomic factors, and mortality and morbidity indicators that describe the overall health status of the UF Health Leesburg Hospital Service Area as compared to Florida. Community Themes and Strengths: This section provides qualitative perspectives on health issues and the health system from the community at- large and fulfills the statutory requirement of taking into account input from persons representing the broad interests of the community serviced by the hospital facility. This section also fulfills the CHNA requirement of receiving community input on the health needs of the community. The Community Themes and Strengths section is comprised of key insights and themes from the community survey and healthcare professional survey. Recommendations and Next Steps: This section begins with a brief summary of the intersecting themes that cut across all sections of the CHNA and some of the key considerations generated from these common themes. Following the summary of these themes and considerations, this section details some general suggestions about how to move forward with the identified needs, provides some specific examples of approaches to address these needs, and discusses some community organization principles that will need to be addressed to ensure that true community health improvement is realized. USING THE COMMUNITY HEAL TH NEEDS ASSESSMENT The 2021 -2022 UF Health Leesburg Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Report is designed so that the two major sections, Community Health Status and Community Themes and Strengths address the core MAPP assessments that are designated as key components of a comprehensive community health needs assessment. The identification of broad health needs of the community comes from an analysis of the intersecting themes in each of these sections. Overall, the main objectives of this CHNA are the following: To accurately depict the UF Health Leesburg Hospital Service Area key health issues based on common themes that emerge from the MAPP assessments; To identify potential strategic issues and some possible approaches to addressing those issues; To provide insight and input to the next phase of the community health improvement planning process and implementation s trategies; UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY , AND INTRODUCTION | PAGE 7 To provide the community a rich data resource not only for the next phase of the improvement process, but also for ongoing resource and program development and implementation as well as evaluation of community health improvement. While the 202 1-2022 UF Health Leesburg Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Report is a stand- alone document, the report works in concert with the accompanying 2022 UF Health Central Florida Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix (also referred to i n this document as the Technical Appendix). Thus, for most data that are briefly addressed in this report, the 2022 UF Health Central Florida Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix presents these data at a level of detail breaking data sets down, for example, by zip code, race, ethnicity, and gender, where appropriate and when available. The 2022 UF Health Central Florida Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix is an in valuable companion resource to the 2 021- 2022 UF Health Leesburg Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Report , and it will allow the community to delve deeper into the issues identified for a more comprehensive understanding of the scope, prevalence an d the populations impacted. The 2022 UF Health Central Florida Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix is comprised of more than 1 40 tables, 1 2 graphs, and supporting material across nearly 300 pages. The 2022 UF Heal th Central Florida Commun ity Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix is organized into the following major data sections: Demographics and Socioeconomics Mortality Mental Health Maternal and Infant Health Health Behaviors Infectious Diseases Health Care Access and Utilization Technical Notes Please note that many of the data tables in the 2021 -2022 UF Health Leesburg Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment and in the 2022 UF Health Central Florida Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix contain standardized rates for the purpose of comparing Lake, Marion and Sumter Counties to the state of Florida as a whole. It is advisable to interpret these rates with caution when incidence and prevalence rates are low; thus, small variations from year to year can result in substantial shifts in the standardized rates . KEY OBSERVATIONS Presented below are the intersecting themes which, in essence, comprise an overview of the major health needs and issues that emerged over the course of this community health needs assessment in the UF Health UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY , AND INTRODUCTION | PAGE 8 Leesburg Hospital (UFHLH) and UF Health Central Florida ( UFH CF) Service Areas. These themes, needs and issues are addressed further in the Recommendations and Next Steps section of this CHNA report. That section includes an enumeration of potential strategic areas of opportunity as well as a compilation of evidence- based and promising practice resources for consideration in the creation of the implementation strategy and action plan to address the identified priority issues. INTERSECTING THEMES/HEALTH NEEDS AND ISSUES Social Determinants (identified in the Community Health Status Assessment data, SWOT and visioning discussions, and the c ommunity and h ealthcare professional survey data) Aging population Higher rates of poverty among certain sub -populations Food insufficiency and affordability of nutritious foods Lack of affordable housing Technology use including internet access Health Status Measures (identified in the Community Health Status Assessment data, S WOT and visioning discussions, and the c ommunity and h ealthcare professional survey data) Infant mortality among all races and ethnicities and birth outcome disparities Overweight and obesity with poor nutrition and eating habits, and physical inactivity as risk factors and contributing causes to chronic diseases and conditions Age-related health problems including chronic diseases and conditions, injuries, impairment and mobility issues Heart Disease, Cancer, Diabetes, Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease, and Stroke Mental health problems including substance, drug and alcohol abuse Dental problems Health outcome disparities among races, ethnicity, and geography Healthcare Access and Utilization (identified in the Community Health Status Assessmen t data, SWOT and visioning discussions , and the c ommunity and h ealthcare professional survey data) Inappropriate and over -utilization of healthcare services (e.g., Emergency Department) High and rising healthcare costs including services, health insurance, prescription drugs Shortages of physicians, nurses, mental health professionals Barriers to accessing primary, specialty, mental health and dental care Post -pandemic reconnections with healthcare providers including return to regular screenings UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 9 Community Health Status INTRODUCTION The Community Health Status section represents the results of the community health status assessment which is one of the four core MAPP assessments for community health needs assessment and community health improvement planning. The data in this section an d in the 2022 UF Health Central Florida Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix were compiled and tabulated from multiple sources including, but not limited to, the United States Census Bureau; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Beha vioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS); Florida Department of Health's Office of Vital Statistics; Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (ACHA); University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute , and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Many of the data tables in this section and in the 2022 UF Health Central Florida Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix report contain standardized rates for the purpose of comparing the UF Health Leesburg Hospital (UF HLH) Service Area to Flo rida as a whole. It is advisable to interpret these rates with caution when incidence and prevalence and incidence rates are low (i.e., the number of cases is small); thus, small variations from year to year can result in substantial shifts in the standardized rates. The data presented in this summary include references to specific tables in the Technical Appendix so that users can refer to the numbers and the rates in context. COVID -19 AND ITS IMPACT The State of Florida officially reported its first COVID -19 case on March 1, 2020. The COVID- 19 pandemic was declared a state of emergency via Executive Order 20 -52 from Governor Ron DeSantis on March 9, 2020. It is important to note that a majority of health status indicators discussed within this assessment have been impacted in some way by COVID -19, most notably, access to healthcare and healthcare utilization. The majority of data discussed within this assessment range s from years 2015 -2019, prior to COVID- 19's onset. Other data range from years 2018 -2020, i ncluding the first year of the pandemic; further , data cover 2021, the first full calendar year of globally living with COVID -19. HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTH EQUITY The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines health disparities as \"preventable differences in the burden of disease, injury, violence, or opportunities to achieve optimal health that are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations\" ( https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/disparities/index.htm , accessed February 15, 2022). Health equity is described as \"the attainment of the highest level of health for all people\" (https://www.cdc.gov/minorityhealth/publications/health_equity/index.html , accessed February 15, 2022). The World Health Organization states that the social determinants of health - those conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age - are principally responsible for health inequities (https://www.who.int/social_determinants/en/ , accessed Feb ruary 15, 2022). Health disparities, or differences in health status, were found during the course of the UF Health Central Florida Community UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 10 Health Needs Assessment process . The assessment also examined potential forces of health inequity as outlined by the Prevention Institute. (https://preventioninstitute.org/sites/default/files/publications/Measuri ng%20What%20Works%20to%2 0Achieve%20Health%20Equity%20_Full_Report.pdf ) accessed February 15, 202 2). According to the Prevention Institute, determinants of health include 1) structural drivers, such as distribution of wealth and power, 2) community determinants, such as physical and economic environment, and 3) quality health care. The need for measurable indicators in each of these three (3) domains is emphasized. Below we discuss patterns of health disparity and potential indicators of health inequity for the UF Health Central Florida (UFHCF ) Service Area. DEMOGRAPHICS AND SOCIOECONOMICS As population dynamics, or variations in the overall composition of a population, change over time, so do the health outcomes and healthcare needs of communities. Therefore, it is important to review specific indicators, including demographic and socioeconomic factors, to understand a community's current health statu s, pressing healthcare issues, and disparities. The following section provides a summary of population distribution including age, gender, and race and ethnicity, and estimates related to the future growth of the population. Also included are measures of education, poverty status, employment, and income. Noted below are key findings from the UF Health Leesburg Hospital (UFHLH) Service Area demographic and socioeconomic profile. POPULATION Population growth is a key determinant of the healthcare services a community requires to be able to sustain positive health behaviors and improved health o utcomes. The UFHLH Service Area primarily serves an older adult population greater than 55 years of age at 65.1 percent of the population, compared to 68.6 percent in the UFHCF Service Area and 33.4 percent in Florida as a whole (Table 12). FIGURE 1. POPU LATION ESTIMATES BY AGE GROUPS BY PERCENT OF POPULATION , UF HEALTH CENTRAL FLORIDA (UFH CF), UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL (UFHLH), THE VILLAGES REGIONAL HOSPITAL (UFHTVH) SERVICE AREAS (SA), 2015 -2019. Source: Table 12, 2022 UF Health Central Florida Community Health Needs Assessment Technical FLORIDA HEALTH SA FloridaUF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 11 As seen in Figure 2 below, the overwhelming majority of the UFHLH Service Area population is White (87.8 percent) which is comparable to the UFH CF Service Area (88.6 percent) but higher than Florida overall (75.1 percent) (Table 9). The Black, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian only, and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander populations comprise 8.1, 0.3, 1.1, and 0.04 percent of the UFHL H Service Area, respectively, while 1.2 percent identify themselves as another race and 1.5 percent identify as having two or more races (Table 9). By 2015 -2019 American Community Survey (ACS), U.S. Census Bureau estimates, 92.3 percent of the population in the UFHLH Service Area identified as non -Hispanic or Latino, which is comparable to 93.1 percent in the UFH CF Service Area and 94.3 percent in the UFHTVH Service Area, but notably larger than the percentage of non-Hispanics in Florida as a whole at 74.4 percent (Table 10).

Source: Table 9, 2022 UF Health Central Florida Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix , prepared by WellFlorida Council , 2022. LIFE EXPECTANCY Considering all races and ethnicities, the longest life expectancy for males, when using a three -year estimate period (2017 -2019) was found in Sumter County (78.0 years) followed by Lake County (75.6 years), and Marion County (72.7 years), compared to Florida (77.0 years) (Table 4). For females, when using a three - year estimate period (2017 -2019), the longest life expectancy was also in Sumter County (82.2 years), followed by Lake County (81.0 years), and Marion County (79.5 years), compared to Florida (82.6 years) (Table 4).

As often seen throughout the state of Florida, there was a disparity in life expectancy in the Black population as compared to the White population in the UFHLH Service Area counties. A stark disparity was found in Sumter County, with an almos t five-year difference between the White and Black life expectancy (80.2 years and 75.0 years, respectively) (Table 5). While Sumter County had the highest overall life expectancy of all three counties, its Black residents had the lowest life expectancy in the UFH CF Service Area. TABLE 1.

County Year Race and Ethnicity Total White Black Hispanic Non -Hispanic Lake Florida Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix , prepared by WellFlorida Council, 2022. ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS According to 2016 -2019 ACS data, 10.4 percent of the population in the UFHLH Service Area had a lower percentage of individuals having lived in poverty in the past 12 months than Florida overall (14.0 percent). The UFH CF Service Area is nearly the same at 10.1 percent whereas the UFHTVH Service Area population fares better at only 8.1 percent. Within the UFHLH Service Area, the zip codes where this indicator of poverty are highest included : 33513 (Bushnell, Sumter County ) at 16.0 percent, 34748 (Leesburg, Lake County ) at 15.7 percent, and 34731 (Fruitland Park, Lake County ) at 14.0 percent. Zip code 32162 (The Villages, Sumter County ) had the lowest percentage of poverty at only 4.7 percent. Across the three counties in the UFHLH Service Area for this same p eriod, Marion County had the highest percentage of individuals having lived in poverty in the past 12 months (16.1 percent) which is higher than the state of Florida (14.0 percent). Lake County had 12.0 percent of its population living in poverty and Sumte r County had 8.2 UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 13 percent, both of which were lower than the percentage of Florida residents living in poverty overall (Table 24). Gender differences can be seen in rates of poverty. For 2015 -2019, the percentage of males having lived in poverty in the past 12 months in the UFHLH Service Area (9.5 percent) was nearly the same as the overall UFH CF Service Area (9.1 percent) but higher than UFHTVH Service Area at 7.2 percent. Both were below the 12.9 percent state rate of males having lived in poverty in the p ast 12 months in Florida. Similarly, the percentage of females having lived in poverty in the UFHLH Service Area (11.3 percent) was nearly the same as the UF HCF Service Area at 11.0 percent but higher than the UFHTVH rate of 8.8 percent. Although these rates for females were lower than the state rate of 15.1 percent, the rates were higher than for males in the same geographic areas. When compared by service area county, both Marion County males at 15.0 percent and females at 17.1 percent had the highest rates for this poverty measure, as both rates exceeded state rates (12.9 and 15.1 percent, respectively). Sumter County males and females had the lowest rates at 7.4 and 8.9 percent, respectively. Lake County's male and female rates (11.0 and 13.0, respectively) were lower than state rates but higher than the UFH CF Service Area rate (9.1 and 11.0, respectively) (Table 28). Poverty rates for children (0 -17 years of age) exceeded state rates in the UFHLH Service Area. Data show that from 2015 -2019 in the UFHLH S ervice Area 25.3 percent of children lived in poverty in the past 12 months compared to 26.9 percent in the UFH CF Service Area and 20.1 percent statewide. The greatest percentage of children living in poverty were in Marion and Lake Counties at 28.1 and 19 .2 percent, respectively, compared to Sumter County at 17.3 percent and Florida at 20.1 percent (Table 24).

For 2015 -2019, the estimated percentage of Black residents having lived in poverty in the past 12 months in the UFHLH Service Area was 25.7 percent compared to 9.1 percent for White residents. This percentage for Black residents was the same as the UFH CF Service Area (25.7 percent) but higher than the state (22.8 percent). Stark differences in poverty rates for White and Black residents were seen in the UFH CF Service Area counties. As seen in the table that follows, the percentages of the Black population in Marion and Sumter Counties (32.8 and 24.3 percent, respectively) having lived in poverty in the past 12 months exceeded the state (22.0 percent). The poverty rate for the White population in Marion County (13.5 percent) also exceeded that of the state for White residents (12.1 percent) (Table 29). TABLE 2.

In the UFHLH Service Area, Sumter County per capita income and median household income for all races exceeded the state figures as well as those for Lake and Marion Counties for 2015 -2019. White residents in Sumter County recorded higher per capita income and median household income than all races in Marion and Lake Counties. Disparity was also found when examining the income gap between the same race in different counties. Most notably, the per capita income for Black residents in Sumter County was $12,207 , compared to the per capita income of Black residents in Lake County at $18,647. The per capita income for Black residents statewide is $20,099, higher than all counties in the service area. The median household income for Lake County Hispanics at $49,499 was the highest among the UFHLH Service Area counties and slightly above the state figure of $49,266 (Table 32).

EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT According to ACS estimates for 2015 -2019, those in the UFHLH Service Area 25 years of age and older whose highest level of education completed was a high school diploma (including equ ivalency diplomas and some college but no degree) for all genders was 55.6 percent; the comparable state rate was 48.5 percent. Those with a college degree (including Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, professional and doctorate degrees) for the UFHLH Serv ice Area represented 36.1 percent of the population compared to 39.7 percent for Florida (Table 46). For the 2019 -2020 school year, of the UFHLH Service Area counties, Lake County achieved the best high school graduation rate at 91.2 percent which exceeded the 90.0 state rate and outpaced Sumter County at 88.0 percent and Marion County at 87.1 percent. Lake County also recorded the highest high school dropout rate for the service area for 2018 -2019 at 4.8 percent, performing worse than the state at 3.4 perc ent, and Marion and Sumter Counties at 3.6 and 4.1 percent, respectively (Table 45). MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY The rates of mortality and morbidity are often considered the most direct measures of health and well -being of a community. To gain a better unders tanding of the current health status of the UFHLH Service Area population, the prevalence of diseases and quality of life indicators were thoroughly examined. Below are some important data points related to the rates of mortality and morbidity in the UFHLH Service Area. CAUSES OF DEATH The top five leading causes of death in the UFHLH Service Area for all races in 2018 -2020 were: Heart Disease, Cancer, Unintentional Injuries, Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease (CLRD) and Stroke. For the UFH CF Service Area, the five leading causes of death were the same as the UFHLH and UFHTVH Service Areas, in differing rank order. For the state of Florida, the five leading causes of death were the same as the UFHLH and UFH CF Service Area, with a slight difference in rank o rder: Heart Disease, Cancer, Stroke, Unintentional Injuries, Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease (CLRD). Heart Disease was the top leading cause of death for the UFHLH and UFH CF Service Areas and the state of Florida. Cancer was the leading cause of UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 16 death for the UFHTVH Service Area (Table 54). Note that the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic in March 2020 impacted death rates for the entirety of the 2018 -2020 time period. As seen in the table below, age- adjusted death rates for the top five causes of death in the CFH Service Area Counties had vast differences between each other. When compared to Florida overall, Lake and Marion Counties had higher rates than the state for all top five leading causes of death, except stroke. The age- adjusted death rates for Sumter County were lower than the state for all top five leading causes of death, except unintentional injuries. TABLE 4.

When examining the top five leading causes of death by zip code, geographic disparities were found within the UFH CF Service Area for the 2018 -2020 time period. Heart Disease was the number one leading cause of death within the service area, as both UFHLH and UFHTVH had higher Age-Adjusted Death Rate s (AADRs) (152.8 and 148.3 per 100,000 population, respectively) as compared to the state (143.1 per 100,000 population). The zip codes most burdened by Heart Disease in the UFHLH Service Area included: (Wildwood, Sumter County ); the zip codes most burdened by Heart Disease in the UFHTVH Service Area included: 34491 and 32159 (Lady Lake, Lake County ) (Table 60). Of note is the overlap in both the UFHLH and UFHTVH Service Area zip codes of 34491 and 34785. UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 17 Cancer was the second leading cause of death within the service area, as both UFHLH and UFHTVH had higher AADRs (145.1 and 142.9 per 100,000 population, respectively) as compared to the state (140.5 per 100,000 population). The zip codes most burdened by C ancer in the UFHLH Service Area included: 34731 ), and 32163 (The Villages, Sumter County ); the zip codes most burdened by Cancer in the UFHTVH Service Area included: 34491 (Summerfield, Mario n ), and 32162 (The Villages, Sumter County ) (Table 61). Of note is the overlap in both the UFHLH and UFHTVH Service Area zip codes of 34491 and 32163. Unintentional injur y was the third leading cause of death within the service area, as both UFHLH and UFHTVH had higher AADRs (86.3 and 77.9 per 100,000 population, respectively) as compared to the state (59.2 per 100,000 population). The zip codes most burdened by Unintentional Injuries in the UFHLH Service Area inc luded: 34491 Marion County ), and 33513 (Bushnell, Sumter County ); the zip codes most burdened by Unintentional Injuries in the UFHTVH Service Area included: 34491 (Summerfiel Marion and 34785 (Wildwood, Sumter County ) (Table 62). Of note is the overlap in both the UFHLH and UFHTVH Service Area zip codes of 34491 and 32162. Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease (CLRD) was the fourth l eading cause of death within the service area, but both UFHLH and UFHTVH had lower AADRs (34.9 and 28.3 per 100,000 population, respectively) as compared to the state (35.5 per 100,000 population). However, within the UFH CF Service Area, some zip codes had higher age -adjusted death rates for CLRD than the state (Table 66). Stroke was the fifth leading cause of death within the service area, but both UFHLH and UFHTVH had lower AADRs (31.9 and 30.8 per 100,000 population, respectively) as compared to the stat e (41.5 per 100,000 population). However, within the UFH CF Service Area, some zip codes had higher age -adjusted death rates for Stroke than the state (Table 64). When examining the top five leading causes of death by race and ethnicity, racial and ethnic disparities were also found within the UFH CF Service Area for the 2018 -2020 time period. Black residents in Sumter County had the overall highest AADR for Heart Disease (252.2 per 100,000 population), which was higher than the statewide Heart Disease AADR f or all races (145.7 per 100,000 population) and the statewide Heart Disease AADR for Black residents (172.8 per 100,000 population). Black residents in Lake and Marion Counties also had higher AADRs for Heart Disease (182.3 and 222.7 per 100,000 population , respectively) as compared to the state. Hispanic and White residents in Marion County also had higher AADRs for Heart Disease (162.0 and 209.3 per 100,000 population, respectively) as compared to the statewide Hispanic and White AADR for Heart Disease (1 17.2 and 142.5 per 100,000 population, respectively) (Tables 57 -58). White residents in Marion County had the overall highest AADR for Cancer (172.3 per 100,000 population), which was higher than the statewide Cancer AADR for all races (142.5 per 100,000 p opulation) and the statewide Cancer AADR for White residents (142.6 per 100,000 population). Hispanic residents in Marion UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 18 County had a higher AADR for Cancer (118.1 per 100,000 population) than the statewide Cancer AADR for Hispanic residents (109.1 per 10 0,000 population). Black residents in Lake County had the second highest AADR for Cancer within the Service Area (168.2 per 100,000 population), which was higher than the statewide Black AADR for Cancer (149.0 per 100,000 population) (Tables 57 -58). White, Black, and Hispanic residents in Lake, Marion, and Sumter Counties all had higher AADRs for Unintentional Injury than the statewide Unintentional Injury AADRs for their respective race and ethnicity (Tables 57 -58) White residents in Marion County had the overall highest AADR for CLRD (48.6 per 100,000 population), which was higher than the statewide CLRD AADR for all races (36.2 per 100,000 population) and the statewide White AADR for CLRD (38.1 per 100,000 population). Black residents in Lake County had a higher AADR for CLRD (33.8 per 100,000 population) than the statewide Black AADR for CLRD (23.4 per 100,000 population). Hispanic residents in Lake, Marion, and Sumter Counties all had lower AADRs for CLRD as compared to the statewide Hispanic AADR for CL RD (20.8 per 100,000 population) (Tables 57 -58). Black residents in Lake County had the overall highest AADR for stroke (56.8 per 100,000 population), which was higher than the statewide Stroke AADR for all races (42.3 per 100,000 population), but lower than the statewide Black AADR for Stroke (61.2 per 100,000 population). Hispanic residents in Lake and Sumter Counties had higher AADRs for Stroke (44.7 and 53.1 per 100,000 population, respectively) as compared to the statewide Hispanic AADR for Stroke (41. 9 per 100,000 population). White residents in Lake, Marion, and Sumter Counties all had lower AADRs for Stroke compared to the statewide White AADR for Stroke (Tables 57 -58). FIGURE 4.

Towards this end, national and state governments have invested substantial resources to understand the health behaviors of residents. This Behavioral Risk Factors section details data on selected health behaviors. These data are collected annually at the national and state levels and in Florida at the county level every three years by telephon e survey as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Because BRFSS data are not available at the zip code level, data for select indicators are presented at the county level for Lake, Mari on, and Sumter Counties to illustrate health behaviors in the UFHLH Service Area. Categories of health behaviors are presented in order below. The BRFSS data are provided in their entirety in Table 113 of the 2022 UF Health Central Florida Community Health Needs Assessment Technical Appendix. CANCER SCREENINGS Women forty years of age and older in Lake and Marion Counties reported having a mammogram in the past year at lower percentages (60.4 percent and 54.5 percent, respectively) than women in Sumter Coun ty (80.3 percent) and statewide (60.8 percent). The percentage of women 18 years of age and older who received a Pap test in the past year was 40.9 percent in Lake County, 47.1 percent in Marion County, and 37.3 percent in Sumter County; the state rate was 48.4 percent (Table 102). Prostate -specific Antigen Test (PSA) testing rates among men aged 50 and older were higher across the UFHLH Service Area counties than statewide. Statewide, 54.9 percent of men reported having had a PSA test in the past two year s compared to 54.9 percent statewide and 55.5 percent in Lake County, 59.1 percent in Marion County, and 77.6 percent in Sumter County. The percentage of men aged 50 years and older who had ever had a PSA test in all three of the service area counties exc eeded the 67.5 state rate. Sumter County men had the highest rate at 90.5 percent, followed by Marion County at 72.3 percent and Lake County at 70.3 percent (Table 101). The percentage of adults 50 years of age and older who received a blood stool test in the past year fell below the statewide percentage (16.0 percent) in both Lake and Sumter Counties (15.0 percent and 14.6 percent, respectively), while Marion County (18.0 percent) exceeded the state (Table 100). Adults over the age of 50 years in L ake, Marion, and Sumter Counties reported higher percentages (44.5, 41.4, and 47.4 percent, respectively) of having ever had a blood stool test as compared to the state (36.0 percent) (Table 100). The percentage of adults over the age of 50 who received a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy in the past five years was higher than the state percentage in Marion and Sumter Counties. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE In 2019, adults in the UFHLH Service Area reported higher than state rates of cardiovascular problems. The percen tage of adults who reported they ever had a stroke in Marion and Sumter Counties (6.3 and 6.6 percent, respectively) was double that of the statewide percentage (3.6 percent). Among Marion and Sumter County adults, more reported (16.3 and 16.4 percent, res pectively) ever having had a heart attack, angina or coronary heart disease or stroke, than statewide (9.5 percent). When reported alone, the percentage of UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 20 adults who have ever had a heart attack was higher across the UFHLH Service Area counties than the s tate (4.7 percent), with the largest difference noted in Marion County (9.6 percent) (Table 113). DIABETES In 2019, the percentage of adults who reported having diagnosed diabetes was higher in all UFHLH Service Area counties compared to the state (11.8 pe rcent). Sumter County had the highest percentage of adults with diagnosed diabetes (18.5 percent), followed by Marion and Lake Counties (16.8 and 12.6 percent, respectively). Adults in the UFHLH Service Area counties reported having pre- diabetes at near si milar percentages compared to the state. The percentage of adults who ever had diabetes self -management education fell below the statewide percentage in Lake, Marion, and Sumter Counties (54.2, 41.5, and 60.3 percent, respectively) (Table 113). HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE Differences in healthcare access and coverage were found when comparing Lake, Marion, and Sumter Counties. In 2019, the percentage of adults who have a personal doctor was higher for all UFHLH Service Area counties as compared to the state (72.0 percent overall). Adults in Sumter County had the highest percentage of adults with a personal doctor (86.0 percent) as compared to Lake and Marion Counties (73.2 and 78.3 percent, respectively). Additionally, the percentage of adults w ith any type of health care insurance coverage was higher in the UFHLH Service Area counties as compared to the state (84.2 percent). Adults in Sumter County had the highest percentage of adults with any type of health care insurance coverage (90.5 percent ) as compared to Lake and Marion Counties (85.2 and 84.9 percent, respectively) (Table 113). Although residents in these counties had higher percentages of insured individuals, the cost of health care caused higher percentages of adults to forgo seeing a d octor within the past year due to cost, as compared to the state (16.0 percent). The highest percentage of adults who could not see a doctor in the past year due to cost was in Marion County (19.1 percent). In Lake County, 13.6 percent of adults could not see a doctor in the past year due to cost. However, adults in Sumter County fared better than the state and Lake and Marion Counties, as 9.5 percent of Sumter County adults could not see a doctor in the past year due to cost (Table 113). Overall, the perce ntage of adults in the UFHLH Service Area who had a medical checkup in the past year was higher than the state (78.8 percent). Sumter County had the highest percentage of adults who had a medical checkup in the past year at 89.1 percent, followed by Marion and Lake Counties (83.4 and 79.0 percent, respectively) (Table 113). HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE Across the UFHLH Service Area in 2019, the percentage of adults who reported poor physical health on 14 or more of the past 30 days exceeded the statewi de percentage (13.8 percent). At 15.7 percent, Marion County adults had the highest percentage, followed by Marion and Sumter Counties (14.8 and 14.0 percent, respectively). Relatedly, the average number of unhealthy physical days in the past 30 days repor ted was highest in Lake County at 5.0 days, followed by 4.8 days in Marion County and 4.3 days in Lake County; the state average was 4.4 days. Among the three UFHLH Service Area counties, Marion County adults reported UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 21 the poorest health -related quality of life indicators, as 26.4 percent reported that their overall health was \"fair\" or \"poor;\" 14.3 percent reporting having had poor mental health on 14 or more of the past 30 days; and 18.3 percent whose poor physical or mental health kept them from doing usu al activities on 14 or more of the past 30 days (Table 113). HIV/AIDS In 2019, the percentage of adults (those less than 65 years of age) who reported ever having been tested for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the UFHLH Service Area was lower th an the state overall (60.7 percent). Marion County had the highest percentage of adults under the age of 65 who reported ever having been tested for HIV (55.9 percent), followed by Lake County and then Sumter County (49.1 and 44.4 percent, respectively) (T able 113). The percentage of adults (all ages) who had ever been tested for HIV in the UFHLH Service Area was again lower than the state overall (50.7 percent). Marion County had the highest percentage of adults who reported ever having been tested for HIV (44.0 percent), followed by Lake County and then Sumter County (37.1 and 25.5 percent, respectively) (Table 113). IMMUNIZATIONS Overall, self -reported immunization rates for 201 9, including those adults who have received a flu shot and/or a pneumococcal vaccination in the past year and/or eve r, across Lake and Sumter Counties were better than those for the state as a whole. However, self -reported immunization rates for Marion County were below the state and other UFHLH Service Area counties' percentages for all indicators except the percentage of adults who have ever received a pneumococcal vaccination (Table 113). OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY In 2019, the statewide percentage of adults who reported being overweight or obese wa s 64.6 percent. Percentages in Sumter and Marion Counties exceeded the state (71.4 and 66.8 percent, respectively), but were lower in Lake County (64.4 percent). When considered separately, obesity rates for the three counties all exceeded the statewide percentage. However, the percentage of adults who reported being overweight only exceeded the statewide percentage of 37.6 percent in Sumter County (43.8 percent). When reviewing self-reported physical activity levels, Marion County adults reported being sed entary at a higher percentage than the state rate (32.3 percent compared to 26.5 percent) (Table 113). SUBSTANCE AND TOBACCO USE In 2019, the percentage of adults who engaged in heavy or binge drinking across the UFHLH Service Area was below the statewide percentage of 18.0 percent. When comparing tobacco use percentages across the UFHLH Service Area, Lake County and Marion County had higher rates of current smokers (15.9 and 18.3 percent, respectively) than the state (14.8 percent) and Sumter County (11.7 percent). The percentage of adults who currently use chewing tobacco, snuff, or snus some days or every day was higher in Marion and Sumter Counties (2.9 and 3.0, respectively) than the state (2.2 percent); use in Lake County was on par with statewide use (2.2 percent). All three service area counties had lower percentages of adults who had never UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 22 smoked as compared to the state. Relatedly, all three service area counties had higher percentages of adults who are former smokers. The percentage of current e -cigarette use was higher across the state than in the UFHLH Service Area (Table 113). MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH During the 2018 -2020 time period there were 4,246 births for all races in the UFHLH Service Area (Table 92). During the same time period, there were 27 infant deaths, with disparate rates noted in some zip codes within the service area. Disparate rates were noted in the following zip codes: 34785 (Wildwood, (L eesburg, ), and 32159 (Lady Lake, Lake County ). Most notable was the infant death rate in zip code 34785 (16.4 per 1,000 total live births), more than double the state's rate (6.0 per 1,000 total live births). The overall infant death rate in th e UFHLH Service Area was 6.4 per 1,000 total live births, similar to the overall infant death rate in the UFHTVH Service Area at 6.3 per 1,000 total live births (Table 93). The infant death rate in the UFHCF Service Area and Florida overall was 6.0 per 1,0 00 total live births. Disparities were noted in infant death rates within the UFHLH Service Area when examined by race and ethnicity during the 2018 -2020 time period. Within the UFHLH Service Area, the White, Black, and Hispanic infant death rates were: 4. 4, 13.0, and 6.0 per 1,000 total live births, respectively. Within the UFHCF Service Area, the White, Black, and Hispanic infant death rates were: 3.3, 14.1, and 5.8 per 1,000 total live births, respectively. The statewide infant death rates for White, Bla ck, and Hispanic infants were: 4.3, 11.0, and 5.0 per 1,000 total live births, respectively (Table 93). The Black and Hispanic infant death rates for both the UFHLH and UFHCF Service Areas were higher than the statewide Black and Hispanic infant death rate s. Within the same time period, the percentage of low birthweight births for all races in the UFHLH Service Area was 9.5 percent, which was similar to the UFHCF Service Area (9.9 percent) but higher than the state overall (8.7 percent). Disparities were no ted between White and Black low birthweight births within the UFHLH and UFHCF Service Areas. Low birthweight births occurred at a higher percentage among Black individuals as compared to White in the UFHLH Service Area (13.8 and 8.4 percent, respectively); the comparable statewide percentage for low birthweight births among Black individuals was 14.0 percent and 7.1 percent among White individuals (Table 94). Low birthweight births occurred at approximately the same rate for Hispanics within the UFHLH Service Area and Florida overall. During the 2016 -2020 time period, statewide teen birth rates decreased, but teen birth rates in the UFHLH, UFHTVH, and UFHCF Service Areas increased overall. The teen birth rate in the UFHLH and UFHCF Service Areas (1.9 and 2.0 percent, respectively) were approximately double the statewide percentage (1.0 percent) (Table 96). During the 2018 -2020 time period, women of all races in the UFHLH and UFHCF Service Areas had higher percentages (70.5 and 70.8 percent, respectively) of first trimester care than the state overall (69.3 percent) (Table 95). However, differences were noted when examining the percent of women who received ca re in the first trimester by race and ethnicity. White women received first trimester care in slightly lower percentages in the UFHLH and UFHCF Service Areas (71.2 percent in both) compared to the state (71.7 UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 23 percent). Black women received first trimester care in higher percentages in the UFHLH and UFHCF Service Areas (68.2 and 69.0, respectively) compared to the state (62.1 percent). Hispanic women received first trimester care in slightly lower percentages in the UFHLH and UFHCF Service Areas (66.2 percen t in both) compared to the state (69.4 percent) (Table 95). TABLE 5.

MENTAL HEALTH Common mental health problems such as anxiety and depression are associated with a variety of other public health issues including substance misuse, domestic violence, and suicide. The following are notable findings related to mental health for the UFHLH Service Area over the 2018 -2020 time period: Rates of hospitalizations for mental health reasons (for all ages, those aged 0 -17, and those 18 years of age and older) in the UFHLH and UFHCF Service Areas were lower than statewide rates. In 2020, Marion County had t he highest rate of hospitalizations for mental health reasons (7.7 per 1,000 population) as compared to Lake and Sumter Counties (7.4 and 1.7 per 1,000 population, respectively). Of note were the higher -than -average rates of 11.3 and 8.5 per 1,000 populati on for all ages in zip codes 34788 (Leesburg, Lake County ) and 33513 (Bushnell, Sumter County ), respectively (Table 83). UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 24 Rates of emergency department (ED) visits for mental health reasons (for all ages and those aged 0 -17) in the UFHLH Service Area were higher than statewide rates. Historically, those aged 0 -17 had higher rates of ED visits for mental health reasons as comp ared to youth across the state. When comparing 2019 and 2020, there was an increase in rates of ED visits for mental health reasons in both the UFHLH and UFHTVH Service Areas, but a decrease in statewide rates. In 2020, rates of ED visits for mental health reasons (for all ages, those aged 0 -17, and those 18 years of age and older) in the UFHLH Service Area were higher than statewide rates. Also of note in 2020 were the higher -than -average rates of 97.1, 96.7, and 91.4 per 1,000 population for all ages in z ip codes 32778 (Tavares, Lake County ), 34788 (Leesburg, Lake County ) and 34491 (Summerfield, Marion County ), respectively (Table 84). Suicide ranked among the leading causes of death for residents 0 -44 years of age (YOA) in the UFHCF Service Area Counties for 2018 -2020 (Tables 73 -74). The crude death rates for residents 0 -17 YOA exceeded the state crude rate in all counties in the UFHCF Service Area. The crude death rates for residents 18 -44 YOA exceeded the state crude rate (16.0 per 100,000 population) in Lake and Marion Counties but was slightly less in Sumter County (13.8 per 100,000 population) (Table 74). The age - adjusted death rate for suicide deaths was higher overall in the UFHLH, UFHTVH, and UFHCF Service Areas (21.2, 15.9, and 22.1 per 100,000 p opulation, respectively) than the state rate (14.4 per 100,000 population) (Table 70). According to 2019 BRFSS data, the percentage of adults who had poor mental health on 14 or more of the past 30 days was highest in Marion County at 14.3 percent; Lake an d Sumter Counties (12.5 and 10.3 percent, respectively) were lower than the state's average (13.8 percent). The percentage of adults with good mental health for the past 30 days was highest in Sumter County (89.7 percent), followed by Lake and Marion Count ies (87.5 and 85.7 percent, respectively), as compared to the state (86.2 percent) (Table 113). In 2020, the rate of domestic violence offenses per 100,000 population in Marion County (1,015.9 per 100,000 population) was more than double the rate of the state (492.2 per 100,000 population). The domestic violence rates in Lake and Sumter County (465.8 and 363.1 per 100,000 population, respectively) were lower than the rates in Marion County and Florida as a whole (Table 91). Numbers and rates of involuntary exam initiations, also known as \"Baker Acts,\" in the three UFHLH Service Area counties for 2009 -2020 are displayed in the table below. Lake and Sumter Counties rates are below state rates per 100,000 population for the entirety of the reporting period. Ma rion County Baker Act rates exceeded state rates early in the reporting period then dropped beginning in 2012 (Table 99).

HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND UTILIZATION Although health insurance and access to healthcare services do not necessarily prevent illness, early intervention and long -term management resou rces can help to improve and maintain quality of life and minimize premature death. It is therefore useful to consider insurance coverage and healthcare access in a community health needs assessment. The 2022 UF Health Central Florida Community Health Need s Assessment Technical Appendix includes data on insurance coverage, Medicaid eligibility, healthcare resources and usage as well as healthcare expenditures by payor source. Key findings from these data sets are presented in sections below. UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 26 SHORTAGE AND M EDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS A Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) is defined as a geographic area, population group or facility designated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration as having shorta ges of primary medical care, dental or mental health providers. A HPSA may be a geographic area such as a county or service area, represent a specific demographic such as low -income population, or be a designated institution such as a Federally Qualified Health Center. The score of shortage areas is calculated using the following four key factors: population -to-primary care physician ratio, percent of population with incomes below 10 0% of the federal poverty level, infant mortality rate or low birthweight rate (depending on which score is higher), and travel time or distance to nearest available source of care (also, depending on which score is higher). The scores range from 0 to 26 f or Dental Health HPSAs and 0- 25 for Primary Care and Mental Health HPSAs, where the higher the score, the greater the priority. The dental HPSAs for Lake County, Marion, County and Sumter County include one (1) population group (\"low income/migrant farm workers\"), five (5) correctional facilities, ten (10) rural health centers, one (1) Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Look -Alike, and three (3) FQHCs. The type of HPSAs with the highest priority scores for all three (3) counties are the FQHC Look -Alike (with a score of 26) and all three FQHCs (also with a score of 26) (Table 122). The mental health HPSAs for Lake, Marion, and Sumter Cou nties include three (3) population groups (one \"low income/migrant farm workers\" and two \"low income\"), four (4) correctional facilities, ten (10) rural health centers, one (1) Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Look -Alike, and three (3) FQHCs. The t ype of HPSA with the highest priority score for all three (3) counties are two FQHCs (with scores of 24) and the FQHC Look -Alike (with a score of 23) (Table 122). The primary care HPSAs for Lake, Marion, and Sumter Counties include three (3) population groups (all three are \"low income\") , five (5) correctional facilities, one (1) FQHC Look -Alike, three (3) FQHCs, and ten (10) rural health centers. The type of HPSA with the highest priority score is the FQHC (with scores of 22 and 21) (Table 122). Medical ly underserved areas (MUAs) and medically underserved populations (MUPs) are sister programs to the Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA). MUAs and MUPs are areas or populations designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) as h aving too few primary care providers, high infant mortality, high poverty, or a high elderly population. The lowest possible score is zero (0) and indicates the highest need while the highest score of 100 indicates areas of lowest need. As of 2022, the MUA with the greatest need in the UFHCF Service Area is located in Lake County (\"low income/migrant farm workers\") with a score of 45.6. Marion County (\"low income/migrant farm workers\") was close behind with a score of 50.9, while Sumter County scored 46.6. For the same time period, there was an MUP designated as \"low income\" in North Lake County (with a score of 45.6) (Table 122). UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 27 HEALTHCARE FACILITIES A variety of licensed healthcare service facilities are located within the UFHCF Service Area counties. In 2022, there were 51 Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) in Lake County, 34 ALFs in Marion County, and 15 ALFs in Sumter County; the rate of ALFs per 10 0,000 population in each county fell below the state rate (14.0 per 100,000 population). Regarding h ealth care clinics, UFHCF Service Area Counties fell short of the state rate (12.7 per 100,000 population) in all three counties; each county's individual ra te was approximately half of the state's rate . The Lake, Marion, and Sumter County hospital bed rates (1.0, 1.6, and 1.2 per 100,000 population, respectively) were similar to the state's rate (1.4 per 100,000 population). Displayed in Figures 5 and 6 below are the numbers and rates of hospital and nursing home beds per 100,000 population in the three UFHCF Service Area counties. Individual county rates fell short of the 2020 state rate of 306.3 hospital beds per 100,000 population in each county. When compa ring 2019 and 2020 rates, the rate of hospital beds per 100,000 decreased in Lake and Sumter Counties, but increased in Marion County. Individual county rates surpassed the state rate of 386.5 nursing home beds per 100,000 in Lake and Marion Counties (485. 0 and 441.1 nursing home beds per 100,000, respectively), but fell short in Sumter County (270.0 nursing home beds per 100,000) (Table 126). When comparing 2019 and 2020 rates, the rate of nursing home beds per 100,000 decreased in Marion and Sumter Counties, but slightly increased in Lake County. FIGURE 5.

PHYSICIAN AND DENTIST AVAILABILITY During 2020 -2021, rates of total physicians per 100,000 population in all three UFHCF Service Area Counties fell below the state (314.0 total physicians per 100,000 population); the rates for Lake, Marion, and Sumter Counties were 206.1, 208.3, and 145.5 p er 100,000 population, respectively (Table 127). When examining physician availability by specialty type, it was found that all three UFHCF Service Area Counties fell below the state rate for OB/GYN physicians (9.2 OB/GYNs per 100,000 population) and the s tate rate for pediatricians (21.9 pediatricians per 100,000 population) (Table 127). Over the same time period, dentists were also in short supply in the UFHCF Service Area. All three counties in the UFHCF Service Area fell below the state rate of 56.7 den tists per 100,000 population; the rates for Lake, Marion, and Sumter Counties were 39.0, 38.9, and 27.0 per 100,000 population, respectively (Table 128). UNINSURED RATES Since 2013, the percentage of uninsured adults (18 -64 years of age) has decreased noti ceably, as provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act went fully into effect. The percentage of uninsured adults in Lake and Sumter Counties has historically been below that of the state over multiple years.

The 2015 -2019 ACS data (for the total civilian noninstitutionalized population) reflected a lower percentage of uninsured persons across both the UFHLH and UFHTVH S ervice Areas as compared to the state (12.8 percent). There was an estimated 7.1 percent uninsured in the UFHLH Service Area, with the highest uninsured percentages in the following zip codes: 34748 (Leesburg, Lake County ) at 11.7 percent, 33513 Sumter County ) at 11.1 percent, and 34731 (Fruitland Park, Lake County ) at 10.8 percent. There was an estimated 4.3 percent uninsured in the UFHTVH Service Area, with the highest uninsured percentages in the following zip codes: 34491 (Summerfield, Marion County ) at 7.6 percent, 32159 (Lady Lake, Lake County ) at 6.2 percent, and 34785 (Wildwood, Sumter County ) at 5.4 percent (Table 41).

MEDICAID For the purpose of data collection and reporting, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) Medicaid Program Office recognizes those enrolled in the Medicaid medical assistance program as \"Medicaid Eligibles.\" As shown in the table below, the percent of the population in Lake and Sumter Counties who were Medicaid eligible wa s lower than the state percent in the 2019 -2021 time period. The percent of the population in Marion County who was Medicaid eligible was higher than the state percent in the same three -year time period. Since 2015, the percent of the population who was Me dicaid eligible had been decreasing. The onset of the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020 caused an increase in Medicaid enrollment not only in Florida, but across the United States for all age groups. 05101520253035 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Lake County Marion County Sumter County FloridaUF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 30 TABLE 7.

INSURANCE UTILIZATION Within the UFHLH Service Area during 2018 -2020, Medicare as the payor source covered the largest percent of discharges and patient days. In 2020, the Medicare payor source figures were 69.7 percent of discharges and 72.6 percent of patient days, which were lower than the previous year's figures. Private insurance covered the second largest percent of discharges and patient days over the same time period, followed by Medicaid. Between 2019 and 2020, Medicaid as a payor source slightly increased, as could be expected with the increase in Medicaid eligibles across the state. VA/Tri- Care comprised the smallest payor source during 2018 -2020 (Table 132). INPATIENT UTILIZATION Within the UFHLH Service Area during 2020, the highest percentage of hospital discharges was seen for residents in zip code 32162 (The Villages, Sumter County ) (19.9 percent). The second highest percentage of hospital discharges was seen for residents in zip code 34748 (Leesburg, Lake County ) (18.1 percent), followed by zip code 32159 (Lady Lake, Lake County ) (12.6 percent). The average length of stay (ALOS) was longest for residents in zip codes 34748 (Leesburg, Lake County ) and 34785 (Wildwood, Sumter County ) at 5.4 days. The ALOS for the UFHLH and UFHCF Service Areas (5.0 and 5.1 days, respectively) were slightly lower than the ALOS statewide (5.2 days) (Table 131).

AVOIDABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DISCHARGES During the 2018 -2020 time period, the most common reason for an avoidable discharge for residents under the age of 65 in the UFHLH Service Area was dehydration. During the same time period, other conditions that were consistently among the top reasons for avoidable discharges included: Cellulitis, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Congestive Heart Failure, Nutritional Deficiencies and problems related to Diabetes (Table 136). When examining 2020 avoidable discharge rates within the UFHLH Service Area by zip code, the highest rates were found in the following zip codes: 32778 (Tavares, Lake County ) at 21.0 per 1,000 population, 34788 (Leesburg, Lake County ) at 20.8 per 1,000 population, and 34748 (Leesburg, Lake County ) at 19.2 per 1,000 population. The avoidable discharge rates in the aforementioned zip codes exceeded the rates in the UFHLH, UFHTVH, and UFCFH Service Areas (14.1, 9.9, and 13.2 per 1,000 population, respectively), as well as the state rate (11.5 per 1,000 population) (Table 134). Over the 2018 -2020 time period, the rate of preventable dental hospitalizations for the UFHLH Service Area was on par with rates in the UFHTVH and UFHCF Service Areas, as well as the statewide rate. In 2020, Marion County had the highest preventable dental hospitalization rate (1.0 per 1,000 population) as compared to Lake and Sumter Counties (0.7 and 0.3 per 1,000 population, respectively). Of note was the higher than average rate of 1.0 per 1,000 population in zip codes 34788 (Leesburg, Lake County ) and 34491 (Summerfield, Marion County ), as compared to the UFHCF Service Area and state (0.7 and 0.8 per 1,000 population, respectively) (Table 130). EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISITS From 2018 -2020, the most commonly reported reasons for an emergency department (ED) visit in the UFHLH Service Area were: chest p ain, cough, unspecified abdominal pain, headache, fever, and shortness of breath (Table 140). Note that these commonly reported reasons account for ED visits which do not result in a patient being admitted for inpatient care. UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 33 During 2020, the largest payor source for ED visits in the UFHLH Service Area was Medicare, followed by Medicaid, and private insurance (44.2, 20.3, and 16.9 percent, respectively); on par with the UFHCF Service area (46.8, 19.3, and 16.1 percent, respectively). The UFHTVH Service Area had a higher percentage of Medicare as a payor source, followed by Medicaid, and private insurance (56.1, 15.0, and 14.4 percent). The UFHLH, UFHTVH, and UFHCF Service Areas each have higher Medicare payor source percentages than the state, while the Medi caid and private insurance payor source percentages were lower than the state (Table 139). When examining 2019 avoidable emergency department (ED) visit rates within the UFHLH Service Area by zip code, the highest rates were found in the following zip code s: 34748 (Leesburg, Lake County ) at 244.8 per 1,000 population, 34491 (Summerfield, Marion County ) at 231.2 per 1,000 population, and 32778 (Tavares, Lake County ) at 203.9 per 1,000 population. The avoidable ED visit rates in the aforementioned zip codes exceeded the overall rates in the UFHLH, UFHTVH, and UFCFH Service Areas (152.6, 117.8, and 147.9 per 1,000 population, respectively), as well as the state rate (190.8 per 1,000 population) (Table 138). Rates of emergency department (ED) visits for mental h ealth reasons (for all ages and those aged 0 -17) in the UFHLH Service Area were higher than statewide rates. Historically, those aged 0 -17 had higher rates of ED visits for mental health reasons as compared to youth across the state. When comparing 2019 an d 2020, there was an increase in rates of ED visits for mental health reasons in both the UFHLH and UFHTVH Service Areas, but a decrease in statewide rates. In 2020, rates of ED visits for mental health reasons (for all ages, those aged 0 -17, and those 18 years of age and older) in the UFHLH Service Area were higher than statewide rates. Also of note in 2020 were the higher -than -average rates of 97.1, 96.7, and 91.4 per 1,000 population for all ages in zip codes 32778 (Tavares, Lake County), 34788 (Leesburg , Lake County) and 34491 (Summerfield, Marion County), respectively (Table 84). Over the 2018 -2020 time period, the rate of preventable ED visits for the UFHLH Service Area was higher than the UFHTVH Service Area and statewide rates. In 2020, Marion County had the highest preventable dental ED visit rate (11.5 per 1,000 population) as compared to Lake and Sumter Counties (7.3 and 3.8 per 1,000 population, respectively). Of note were the higher -than -average rates of 11.5 and 11.1 per 1,000 population in zip codes 34788 (Leesburg, Lake County ) and 34491 (Summerfield, Marion County ), respectively (Table 129). COVID -19 For the purposes of this discussion, note that age -adjusted death rates, case counts, vaccines, hospital discharges, and ED visits specific to COVID -19 were only reported at the county and statewide levels; no zip code data w ere available. AGE -ADJUSTED DEATH RATES As seen below, there are notable disparities in age -adjusted death rates (AADRs) for COVID -19 when considering race, ethnicity, and gender. Black individuals in all three counties had the highest AADR, when disaggregated by race and ethnicity. The Black AADR in Marion County was highest across the UFHCF Service Area at 118.5 per 100,000 population, compared to the state rate of 106.0 per 100,000 population. UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 34 Hispanics across the three counties had the second highest overall AADR. The Hispanic AADR in Marion County was the second highest across the UFHCF Service Area at 96.1 per 100,000 population, as compared to the state rate of 89.8 per 100,000. There was also a difference noted between the male and female AADR for COVID -19, as men died at higher rates due in all three counties and across the state (Table 82) . TABLE 9.

COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS The County Health Rankings are a key component of the Mobilizing Action Toward Community Health (MATCH), a collaboration project between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Counties receive a rank relative to the health of other counties in the state . Counties having high ranks, e.g., 1 or 2, are considered to be the \"healthiest\". Health is viewed as a multifactorial construct. Counties are ranked relative to the health of other counties in the same state on the following summary measures: I. Health Out comes --rankings are based on an equal weighting of one length of life (mortality) measure and four quality of life (morbidity) measures. II. Health Factors --rankings are based on weighted scores of four types of factors: a. Health behaviors (9 measures) b. Clinical care (7 measures) c. Social and economic (9 measures) d. Physical environment (5 measures) Throughout the years, some County Health Rankings methodology and health indicators have changed. Thus, caution is urged in making year -to-year comparisons. The data are useful as an annual check on health UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 38 outcomes, contributing factors, resources and relative status within a region and state. The County Health Rankings add to data a community can consider in assessing health and determining priorities. The County Heal th Rankings are available for 2010 through 2021. In the latest rankings, out of 67 counties in the state, Lake County ranked 30th for health outcomes and 18th for health factors; Marion County ranked 54th for health outcomes and 38th for health factors; an d Sumter County ranked 28th for health outcomes and 32nd for health factors. Factors and indicators that contributed to each of the UFHLH Service Area counties' rankings are briefly described below. County Health Ranking scores for the three service area c ounties are displayed in the table that follows. Lake County ranked 30th for mortality and morbidity, it also ranked 5th for clinical care, 20th for health behavior and social & economic factors, and 39th for its physical environment. Marion County ranked 59th and 47th for mortality and morbidity, respectively; it also ranked 35th for health behavior, ranked 29th for clinical care, 47th for social & economic factors, and 53rd for its physical environment. Sumter County ranked 37th and 16th for mortality a nd morbidity, respectively; it also ranked 13th for health behavior, 12th for clinical care, 48th for social & economic factors, and 30th for its physical environment. HEALTH FACTORS AND HEALTH OUTCOME SCORES Health factors influence the health of a commu nity and include socioeconomic factors, health behaviors, and clinical care. As seen in the table below, the overall health outcomes ranking in Marion County (54th) was much lower than both Sumter (28th) and Lake Counties (30th). In the UFHLH Service Area, Marion County fared worse in both health factors and outcomes than Lake and Sumter Counties. TABLE 14.

UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 40 Community Themes and Strengths Quantitative data from an array of secondary or administrative data sets can only describe part of a community's core health needs and health issues. A community perspective of health and the healthcare experience are essential to fully understanding the h ealth of the community. The UF Health Leesburg Hospital (UFHLH) generated community perspectives on health and the healthcare system in the service area through surveying. Community surveys of residents and healthcare providers were conducted. The key obse rvations and findings from the surveys comprise the Community Themes and Strengths Assessment and are presented below. COMMUNITY SURVEY AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL SURVEY METHODOLOGY The UF Health Central Florida Steering Committee, in partnership with WellFlorida Council, collaborated to formulate two similar electronic surveys to query individuals about community health issues and their perspectives on the healthcare. Each survey was tailored to its intended audience which included members of the community at- large and healthcare providers. Guided by service area demographics, the surveys were available in English and tested for readability to assure conformity with best practices. Both surveys employed a convenience sampling approach where respondents were selected based on their convenient accessibility to the surveys. The UF Health Central Steering Committee assisted with the survey dissemination through their respective organizations and by connecting WellFlorida to key stakeholder s and community partners. The community survey was marketed via print (local newspapers) and electronic media (Twitter, Facebook, web site postings). The healthcare professional survey was promoted through UF Health Central Florida internal communications as well as external web site postings. The surveys were accessible online using devices such as laptop computers, tablets, and cell phones. There were 702 respondents to the community survey and 106 to the healthcare professional survey. After eliminati ng the incomplete and ineligible surveys, there were 608 community surveys and 23 healthcare professional surveys for analysis. The survey instruments are included in the Appendix. For the purpose of this assessment, a community member was defined as any person 18 years of age or older who resides in the UF Health Central Florida service area including Lake, Marion, and Sumter Counties. Responses from individuals who did not meet the aforementioned criteria were not included in the data analysis. While t here are advantages of utilizing a convenience sampling approach, such as the ability to rapidly analyze and extrapolate findings to form conclusions, it is difficult to argue that the sample is representative of the population UF Health Central Florida, a nd specifically UF Health Leesburg Hospital, serve. As a whole, women, older adults, and white residents were overrepresented in the respondent group. While the insights obtained from each survey are extremely valuable, they cannot be generalized to all UF Health Central Florida service area residents and healthcare professionals. UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT | PAGE 41 OBSERVATIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY SURVEY Tables 14-26 below summarize the over -arching community health and healthcar e issues questions asked of community members and healthcare professionals. In general, the top five or the leading responses for each questi on are presented . Where sufficient data are available, responses are presented by the UF Health Central Florida service areas of UF Health Leesburg Hospital (UFHLH) and UF Health The Villages\u00ae Hospital (UFHTVH) and the service area counties (Lake, Marion, Sumter) . Questions regarding the following topics are included in the analysis: Community's most important health -related problems that should be addressed Behaviors with greatest impact on overall health Healthcare services that are difficult to obtain Barriers to receiving dental, primary and mental health care COVID -19 pandemic -related health behaviors and challenges Some noteworthy observations include: The issues ranked as the most important health -related problems show ed some common themes across the service area. Age- related issues were among the top -ranked issues across all service areas and counties. Access to sufficient and nutritious food emerged a s the second top-ranked issues across the service area . Among the top five ranked issues were also mental health problems, access to long -term care, dementia, access to primary/family healthcare services, and affordable assisted living facilities (Table 15 below). Across the service area, behaviors with the greatest negative impact on health were drug abuse and alcohol abuse. Also ranked highly among the negative behaviors were distracted driving, tobacco use, eating unhealthy foods and drinking sugar -sweet ened beverages, lack of personal responsibility, and lack of physical activity. (Table 1 6 below). At the top of the list of healthcare services rated as difficult to obtain were mental and behavioral care, preventive care, and alternative medicine and therapies . Dental care, emergency room care and in - patient hospital care were singled out as a difficult to obtain service in the UFH LH service area as well as in each of the three service area counties (Table 1 7 below). While not all survey respondents experienced challenges in receiving dental, primary and/or mental health/substance use care, those who did frequently cited cost and insurance coverage as barriers and long waits or lack of appointment availability were also common problems (Tables 1 8-20 below). The COVID -19 pandemic presented challenges on households in the UFHLH service area and in the UFHCF service area in general. A notable potential impact on personal health and the healthcare system was the reported delay in getting routine and needed health and dental care (Table s 21 -23 below).

Questions on the following topics are included in the analysis: Community's most important health -related problems that should be addressed Behaviors with greatest impact on overall health Healthcare services that are difficult to obtain Barriers to receiving healthcare services COVID -19 pandemic -related health behaviors and challe nges Some noteworthy observations include: Somewhat different from community members, healthcare professionals ranked homelessness and substance and drug abuse as the most important health -related problems that need to be addressed. Healthcare profession als also ranked mental health problems , access to affordable assisted -living facilities and access to primary/family care as their top issues (Table 28 below) .

First, the Intersecting Themes and Key Considerations are summarized in order to identify the key health needs and issues in the UFHLH Service Area. Second, this section provides links to major national databases of community health improvement best practices that will be critical resources to identifying proven effective programs and interventions that could be implemented in the UFHLH Service Area. These national databases have been used to specify some of the most promising practices in some of the key issue areas identified for the UFHLH Service Area in the assessment . INTERSECTING THEMES AND KEY CONSIDERATIONS Presented below are the intersecting themes which, in essence, comprise an overview of the major health needs and issues that emerged over the course of this community health needs assessment in the UFHLH and UF Health Central Florida ( UFHCF ) Service Areas. The list of common themes is followed by an enumeration of potential overarching strategies as well as a compilation of evidence -based and promising practice resources for consideration in the creation of the implementation strategy and action plan to address the identified priority issues. Social Determinants (identified in the Community Health Status As sessment data, SWOT and visioning discussions, and the community and healthcare professional survey data) Aging population Higher rates of poverty among certain sub -populations Food insufficiency and affordability of nutritious foods Lack of affordable housing Technology use including internet access Health Status Measures (identified in the Community Health Status Assessment data, SWOT and visioning discussions, and the community and healthcare professional survey data) Infant mortality among all races and ethnicities and birth outcome disparities Overweight and obesity with poor nutrition and eating habits, and physical inactivity as risk factors and contributing causes to chronic diseases and conditions Age-related health problems including chronic diseases and conditions, injuries, impairment and mobility issues Heart Disease, Cancer, Diabetes, Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease, and Stroke Mental health problems including substance, drug and alcohol abuse Dental problems Health outcome disp arities among races, ethnicity, and geography Healthcare Access and Utilization (identified in the Community Health Status Assessment data, SWOT and visioning discussions, and the community and healthcare professional survey data) UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS | PAGE 70 Inappropriate and over -utilization of healthcare services (e.g., Emergency Department) High and rising healthcare costs including services, health insurance, prescription drugs Shortages of physicians, nurses, mental health professionals Barriers to accessing primary, specialty, mental health and dental care Post -pandemic reconnections with healthcare providers including return to regular screenings KEY CONSIDERATIONS Promote a culture of community health as a network of diverse partners and systems Foster a unifying community organizing principle and capacity building system around shared outcomes and measures Create core system metrics to monitor performance of the community health system and to inform collective and individual entity investments in community health Develop health literacy initiatives that educate on healthcare system resource availability and appropriate use Enhance or create preventive programs, services and resources to improve maternal health and birth outcomes Enhance or create preventive programs, services and resources to address behaviors that lead to or exacerbate chronic diseases and conditions such as Cancer, Heart Disease, Diabetes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Stroke Enhance or create initiat ives to more effectively (as measured by health outcomes) and efficiently (as measured by cost and patient experience indicators) manage chronic diseases and conditions Create initiatives to remove impediments that restrict access to primary, mental health and dental care services and professionals Consider supporting and/or enacting policies and initiatives that address root causes of systemic community and personal health issues INTERVENTIONS: GENERAL APPROACHES AND SPECIFIC OPPORTUNITIES Prior to any type of prioritization of interventions and activities to address critical health needs and issues in the UFHLH Service Area, community partners should review existing databases of evidence -based and promising practices. These resources have been designed to catalogue the best practices for addressing countless key community health issues. Each of these resources is designed a bit differently, but at the core, either provides a comprehensive and regularly updated list of promising and evidenc e-based practices or has a quer iable interface that allows partners to identify best practices based on the issue, type of intervention or target population. In general, these databases should be consulted prior to any type of intervention identification or prioritization within the community. Presented below are five of the most frequently utilized and widely respected databases of practices for improving community health. UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS | PAGE 71 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Community Health Improvement Navigator http://wwwn.cdc.gov/chidatabase County Health Rankings Policy Database - University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/policies/ The Community Guide - U.S Department of Health and Human Services, Community Prevention Services Task Force http://www.thecommu nityguide.org/index.html Healthy People 2020 Evidence- Based Resources - U.S. Department of Health and Human Services http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/tools -resou rces/Evidence -Based -Resources Community Tool Box - The University of Kansas KU Work Group for Community Health and Development http://ctb.ku.edu/en/databases -best -practices One key feature o f each of these resources is to qualify the quality of the evidence upon which these practices are deemed best practices. When reviewing practices at these sites, one must keep in mind the following qualifiers for the quality of and the type of evidence u pon which the intervention is based: Case -Control Study : A case -control study identifies all incident cases that develop the outcome of interest and compares their exposure history with the exposure history of controls sampled at random from everyone with in the cohort who is still at risk for developing the outcome of interest. Cohort Study : A cohort study is a clinical research study in which people who presently have a certain condition or receive a particular treatment are followed over time and compar ed with another group of people who are not affected by the condition. May or may not determine an evidence -based practice. Cross -Sectional or Prevalence Study : A cross- sectional or prevalence study is a study that examines how often or how frequently a di sease or condition occurs in a group of people. Prevalence is calculated by dividing the number of people who have the disease or condition by the total number of people in the group. May or may not determine an evidence -based practice. Effective Practice: A program that has been scientifically evaluated and has quantitative measures of improvement but those measures are not statistically significant. Evidence -Based : The study is of peer review quality and presents statistically significant results in a scientific manner. The intervention may be categorized simply as \"evidence -based\" or as \"low,\" \"moderate\" or \"strong\" depending on the strength of the statistical significance. Evidence -Based (Low or Suggestive): While there are no systematic experi mental or quasi -experimental evaluations, the evidence includes non -experimental or qualitative support for an association between the innovation and targeted healthcare outcomes or processes, or structures in the case of healthcare policy innovations. Evidence -Based (Moderate) : While there are no randomized, controlled experiments, the evidence includes at least one systematic evaluation of the impact of the innovation using a quasi- experimental design, which could include the non -random assignment of individuals to comparison groups, before -UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS | PAGE 72 and-after comparisons in one group, and/or comparisons with a historical baseline or control. The results of the evaluation(s) show consistent direct or indirect evidence of the effectiveness of the innovation in imp roving targeted healthcare outcomes and/or processes, or structures in the case of healthcare policy innovations. However, the strength of the evidence is limited by the size, quality, or generalizability of the evaluations, and thus alternative explanatio ns cannot be ruled out. Evidence -Based (Strong): The evidence is based on one or more evaluations using experimental designs based on random allocation of individuals or groups of individuals (e.g. medical practices or hospital units) to comparison groups. The results of the evaluation(s) show consistent direct evidence of the effectiveness of the innovation in improving the targeted healthcare outcomes and/or processes, or structures in the case of healthcare policy innovations. Evidence of Ineffectiveness : Strategies with this rating are not good investments. These strategies have been tested in many robust studies with consistently negative and sometimes harmful results. Experimental Study : An experimental study is a type of evaluation that seeks to deter mine whether a program or intervention had the intended causal effect on program participants. Expert Opinion : Strategies with this rating are recommended by credible, impartial experts but have limited research documenting effects; further research, often with stronger designs, is needed to confirm effects. Experimental Study : An experimental study is a type of evaluation that seeks to determine whether a program or intervention had the intended causal effect on program participants. Individual Study : Scie ntific evaluation of the efficacy of an intervention in a single study. Insufficient Evidence : Strategies with this rating have limited research documenting effects. These strategies need further research, often with stronger designs, to confirm effects. Mixed Evidence : Strategies with this rating have been tested more than once and results are inconsistent or trend negative; further research is needed to confirm effects. Nonsystematic Review : A non -systematic review is a critical assessment and evaluation of some but not all research studies that address a particular issue. Researchers do not use an organized method of locating, assembling, and evaluating a body of literature on a particular topic, possibly using a set of specific criteria. A non -systematic review typically includes a description of the findings of the collection of research studies. The non -systematic review may or may not include a quantitative pooling of data, called a meta- analysis. Peer -Reviewed : A publication that contains original articles that have been written by scientists and evaluated for technical and scientific quality and correctness by other experts in the same field. Pilot Study : A pilot study is a small -scale experiment or set of observations undertaken to decide how and whe ther to launch a full -scale project. Practice- based Example : A practice -based example is an original investigation undertaken in order to gain new knowledge partly by means of practice and the outcomes of that practice. Promising Practice/Good Idea: The p rogram evaluation is limited to descriptive measures of success. UF HEALTH LEESBURG HOSPITAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS | PAGE 73 Randomized Control Trial : A randomized control trial is a controlled clinical trial that randomly (by chance) assigns participants to two or more groups. There are various methods to randomiz e study participants to their groups. Scientifically Supported : Strategies with this rating are most likely to make a difference. These strategies have been tested in many robust studies with consistently positive results. Some Evidence: Strategies with this rating are likely to work, but further research is needed to confirm effects. These strategies have been tested more than once and results trend positive overall. Systematic Review : A systematic review is a critical assessment and evaluation of all res earch studies that address a particular issue. Researchers use an organized method of locating, assembling, and evaluating a body of literature on a particular topic using a set of specific criteria. A systematic review typically includes a description of the findings of the collection of research studies. The systematic review may or may not include a quantitative pooling of data, called a meta -analysis. Systematic Review - Insufficient Evidence: The available studies do not provide sufficient evidence to determine if the intervention is, or is not, effective. This does NOT mean that the intervention does not work. It means that additional research is needed to determine whether or not the intervention is effective. Systematic Review - Recommended : The sys tematic review of available studies provides strong or sufficient evidence that the intervention is effective. The categories of \"strong\" and \"sufficient\" evidence reflect the Task Force's degree of confidence that an intervention has beneficial effects. They do not directly relate to the expected magnitude of benefits. The categorization is based on several factors, such as study design, number of studies, and consistency of the effect across studies. Systematic Review - Recommended Against : The systematic review of available studies provides strong or sufficient evidence that the intervention is harmful or not effective. Table 42 presents some best practices for many of the key health issues and needs areas in the UFHLH Service Area and are wort hy of consideration as community interventions. Some of these best practices may already be in place in the area and need enhancement while others represent new opportunities.

Counseling, feedback, and financial incentives appear to reduce the number of women smoking in late pregnancy. Infant Mortality and Maternal Child Health Alcohol - Excessive Consumption: Electronic Screening and Brief Interventions (e -SBI) e-SBI to reduce excessive alcohol consumption uses electronic devices (e.g., computers, telephones, or mobile devices) to facilitate the delivery o f key elements of traditional screening and brief intervention. With traditional screening and brief intervention (SBI), providers assess patients' drinking patterns and offer those who screen positive for excessive drinking with a brief, face -to-face intervention that includes feedback about associated risks, changing drinking patterns, and referral to treatment if appropriate. At a minimum, e -SBI involves screening individuals for excessive drinking, and delivering a brief intervention, which provides per sonalized feedback about the risks and consequences of excessive drinking.
