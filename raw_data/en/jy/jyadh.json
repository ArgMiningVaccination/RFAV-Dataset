Student Health will host various flu vaccine outreach events on campus this fall, no appointment necessary: first and most important step in preventing flu is to get a flu vaccine each year. The flu vaccine has been shown to reduce flu-related illnesses and the risk of serious flu complications that can result in hospitalization or even death. CDC also recommends everyday preventive actions (like staying away from people who are sick, covering coughs and sneezes, and frequent hand washing) to help slow the spread of germs that cause respiratory (nose, throat, and lungs) illnesses, like flu. Influenza, commonly called \"the flu,\" is caused by the influenza virus, which infects the respiratory tract. The virus is typically spread from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes the virus into the air. Compared with other viral respiratory infections such as the common cold, influenza infection can cause severe illness and also precipitate serious and life-threatening complications. Typical clinical features include fever, dry cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, headache, muscle aches, and extreme fatigue.

It takes about 1 to 2 weeks after vaccination for antibodies against influenza to develop and provide protection. The effectiveness of the flu vaccine in protecting individuals against illness or serious complications of the flu depends on primarily: 1) the age and health status of the person receiving the vaccine and 2) the similarity or \"match\" between the virus strains in the vaccine and those in circulation. When the \"match\" between the vaccine and circulating strains is close, the flu vaccine prevents illness in approximately 70%-80% of healthy persons younger than age 65 years.

You may be able to spread the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick. People with flu are most contagious in the first 3-4 days after their illness begins. Some otherwise healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick. Some people, especially young children and people with weakened immune systems might be able to infect others for an even longer time.
