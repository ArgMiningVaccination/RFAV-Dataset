Our Patients Love Us! \"Once you have your first appointment, you will truly understand why this clinic has gotten so many 5-star reviews. This is a clinic genuinely dedicated to your wellness, with staff and doctors who take an invested interest in helping you feel better. I had my first appointment today with Dr. Marco Vespignani. My first thoughts- I am THANKFUL. I have been battling migraines for the past 5 or 6 months and this was the first doctor appointment that I walked away from feeling hopeful.\" Melissa \"Looking for a cool / understanding / sharp naturopathic physician? Dr. Mischley is all that. A little over a year ago, my body gave me an overdue-red-flag, and when it finally went into time-out mode, Dr.Mischley helped me to put my body back in a gear. She introduced me to a new way of life style without losing my identity. She is the best Dr. I've ever met.\" Roku \"I had my first appointment and it was a very positive one. She took the time to understand my concerns and had a great wonderful, calming, bedside manner. The gal up front was also super friendly.\" Kat \"Dr. McCarty is hands down my favorite naturopath I've had the pleasure of seeing for my women's health issues. She was always kind, helped me understand the science behind my health plan, and had the most welcoming office. She would still be my doctor if I hadn't moved from Seattle. I would recommend her to anyone.\" LH Schedule an Appointment Better health and wellness starts today! With caring providers and practices, you will feel at home with Seattle Integrative Medicine. "}
