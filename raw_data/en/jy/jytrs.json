Aromatherapy and Essential Oils: The Basics Aromatherapy is both an art and a science. The practice offers a holistic approach to healthcare by using essential oils to balance the mind, body, and spirit. To briefly break down [the science of aromatherapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198031/): scents trigger olfactory receptors that stimulate the emotional center of the brain. While aromatherapy and essential oils have been around for centuries, clinical findings proved its effectiveness in 1937, according to the [National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy](https://naha.org/explore-aromatherapy/about-aromatherapy/what-is-aromatherapy). [Essentials oils](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-are-essential-oils) come from plants, herbs, flowers, and trees. In aromatherapy, patients inhale, ingest or apply oils topically. According to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-are-essential-oils), some of the many benefits of essential oils include: - Relaxation - Reduced inflammation - Improved sleep quality - Stress reduction - Eased depression symptoms Benefits for Those With Alzheimer's or Dementia While the search for comprehensive dementia treatments continues, studies suggest that aromatherapy and essential oils may treat symptoms of the disease. Aromatherapy can relieve general depression symptoms, according to [recent research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5241490/). As depression is a common side effect for individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's or other dementias, aromatherapy treatments can improve overall quality of life. Aromatherapy and essential oils can also ease anxiety, which ultimately improves the quality of sleep. [NIH research](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/sleep-deprivation-increases-alzheimers-protein) shows that restful sleep is imperative for Alzheimer's patients as unrest can increase the protein associated with the disease. Agitation from memory loss is often one of the more difficult symptoms to treat. [Recent studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612440/) show that several essential oils\u2014including lavender, bergamot, and lemon\u2014can calm memory care patients. The oils suppress both aggression and agitation. Besides relieving symptoms associated with memory disturbances, aromatherapy can improve cognitive performance. [A 2012 study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2045125312436573) shows that rosemary can boost overall brain performance. Additionally, [a 2013 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3979126/) provides evidence that rosemary may improve the ability to remember events and future tasks. [A 2009 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20377818) of general aromatherapy and dementia patients also showed significant improvement in cognitive function for all those studied.
