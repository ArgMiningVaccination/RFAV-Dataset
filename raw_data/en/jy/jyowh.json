Despite its age-old roots, this wisdom is still highly relevant and perhaps even more beneficial than ever before when it comes to finding balance and optimal health in modern life. The modern world can be a toxic environment, and even if we are mindful about eating well, exercising and finding ways to reduce stress, toxins still build up within our bodies. Translated from Sanskrit, Ayurveda means 'The science of life' and it exists as a body of wisdom designed to heal people on a deep level and prevent illness and disease. The focus of Ayurveda is to balance body, mind and spirit and to do so, it includes things such as massage, meditation, yoga, diet, herbal medicine, special oils and unique age-old treatments that marry science and nature in perfect union. Ayurveda focuses on improving your overall health so the body can do the job for you. Equilibrium is the goal and balance is always key. The holistic nature of Ayurveda is one of the things that makes it both effective, and also a long-term solution. No longer do you need to travel to India to experience traditional Ayurveda treatments and their special healing benefits. Unlike the one-size-fits-all approach to western medicine, Ayurveda takes into account individuality. Ayurvedic practitioners will determine your individual constitution to ensure that you are receiving exactly what you need to find balance and good health. Overall though, Ayurveda has been proven to support longevity, detoxification, clarity of mind, fertility, hormonal balance, stress reduction, anti aging, immunity, lowers inflammation, boosts energy levels, improves sleep, improves digestion and much more.
