Easy Practices to Incorporate Into Your Life To Promote Liver Qi Happiness Your liver does not like it when you hold in your anger and emotions and let them pent up inside. Here are some simple tried and true self-care tips you can do safely and productively to get your head and emotions straight. These work for us and do not cost a dime and you have everything in your house to start doing it today. Start a journal Get out your feelings on paper. This is not a journal about what you ate that day and your events but instead write about your fears. Put your pen to paper and write about whatever the heck is pissing you off. Don't hold back. Feel free to use any adjectives you need. Go ahead and get it out. Don't let anyone read it except for yourself. It is freeing. The pen will show you the way to release your anger, fear and loneliness. There is no one else that can do this for you. You have to be responsible for your own emotions and keep them on track. Activate your Liver Qi with Acupressure Massage Points A popular treatment mode for helping to reduce stress and anger, with Liver Qi Stagnation, is known as the \"four gates.\" The four gates are the right and left side acupuncture points Liver 3 (Tai Chong) located on the foot and Large Intestine 4 (He Gu) located on the hand.These four acupuncture points may enhance the circulation of Qi and blood throughout the body and have a calming and can help with pain. It is free and only takes a minute or two, so you might as well give it a try. (Exclusion: Acupressure is not suggested for pregnant patients) Large Intestine 4 (He Gu) is located on the padded area of your hand between the thumb and index finger, between the first and second metacarpal bones. Massage this point with your thumb on the top and your index and middle finger on the other side and massage and press down and squeeze firmly. You will do this on both hands for approximately 30 seconds to a minute. You need to do this very firmly and press down really hard for it to work. The more liver stagnation you have the more tender the area may be. It may be a little uncomfortable for a moment, but the positive effects are well worth it. Liver 3 (Tai Chong) is located in a hollow on the top of your foot below the gap between your big toe and the next toe, between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. To stimulate this point, place your heel in the juncture between the bones that attach to the large and second toes and gently knead the point for approximately thirty seconds to a minute. Then switch sides to stimulate Liver 3 point on your other foot. Once again, you need to do this firmly and it may be uncomfortable but that means you are doing it correctly and your qi may already be stagnate and need to be released. You may also activate Liver 3 with using your thumb and fingers like you did for liver 4 but sometimes people have a difficult time bending over and reaching, so the foot method is easier. Exercise and Movement Have you ever watched a dog get up first thing in the morning? What is the first thing they do? Dogs do a big stretch and a downward dog position. Your body and your organs love you when you safely and gently stretch, stand up straight and allow your organs to move freely in your body. Exercising (especially cardio, yoga, Tai qi - but don't overdo it and exhaust yourself) Walking, if you do not have underlying conditions that prevent this, is an easy, cheap and way to get moving gently and also clear your head. If you can walk outside and do a little [ forest bathing](https://environhealthprevmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s12199-009-0091-z) and be around greenery, there have been studies that shown this has a very positive effect of people's mental health. Breathing Exercises and Meditation Take a minute out 3-4 times a day to do cleansing breaths or whenever you feel stressed. This breathing exercise is a quick and easy way to get your qi flowing. Breathe in through your nose slowly and deeply and then exhale out though your mouth slowly. Let your shoulders relax. Close your eyes, if you wish. Do this breathing exercise 3 times in a row. You can do this absolutely anywhere and no one even has know that you are doing it. Avoid the Wind It is just like your mama told you. Cover your head and neck or you will catch a cold or draft. The one environmental effect that liver dislikes is wind. According to [ NIH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5234349/), wind is the strongest exogenous factor in winter and spring. When your body defenses are lowered due to the wind, its defensive capabilities are weakened, causing a mismatch in the opening and the closing of the pores in the entire body, leading to the invasion of other pathogenic factors causing diseases with symptoms such as a headaches, fever , runny nose and cough. Stay strong and well by covering your head and chest in the spring. It may seem warmer outside but the stress that the wind puts on your body is not good for it. Stop stressing and do something to fix it Turn off the news. Watching the news non-stop is toxic and will drive your blood pressure through the roof. Instead, make yourself a list of things that need to be done to fix the situation you are in. Plan it out. Be creative as you are smart. Reinvent yourself. Look for other opportunities. Look to future, even though your future may be unknown. Your brain needs to understand that there is a way out of this stagnant situation, and you are taking actionable steps to meet those goals. Be realistic as your goals and strategies need to flex along the way. Meal planning and Recipes to Support Liver Heat and Liver Fire Liver heat/ Liver Fire may leave the body feeling hot and sweaty, thirsty, constipated, odorous wind and stools, burning of the anus area after bowl movement. You may also have anxiety, red eyes, red face, emotional rages, headaches, vivid dreams, ulcers in the mouth or tongue, cold sores around the mouth. Some individuals may have red tongues with a thick yellow coating on the tongue, rapid pulse, heart burn and dark or yellow urine. A heaty body constitution enjoys cooling, neutral, bitter and sour foods. However, all body constitutions need to first take care of their spleen and that means eating nourishing warmed and easy to digest foods. As you remember, there are [five total energies of food](https://www.hwcmagazine.com/recipe/introducing-the-five-energies-of-food/): cold, hot, warm, cool and neutral.

Below is a list of different recipes that are either neutral or cooling in nature. Neutral foods are good for all body constitutions whether you are heaty or cold in nature.
