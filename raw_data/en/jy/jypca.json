This can be accomplished very easily with crystal wands, which can be used to support massage work and reflexology, to enhance acupuncture and acupressure, to balance the chakras, and much more. In fact, whatever healing modality you practice on yourself or on others, crystal wands can enhance the overall effects. Michael Gienger's 2015 book Crystal and Stone Massage introduced the basic methods of applying crystals for massage, and he has been a major influence on my own work. Michael was one of the world's leading experts on the use of crystals, and since publication of his book Crystal and Stone Massage in the United States,*1 interest in the use of crystals in massage and in other healing applications has grown exponentially, such that a book that specifically considers crystal wands is now warranted; that book you hold in your hands. The story of how I came to write this book starts in the summer of 1996. I was sitting with Michael in his garden, discussing the various ways we could make our treatments more effective. We had both discovered that reflexology, which we had each practiced for many years, obtains additional positive effects when combined with the use of crystals. We wanted to use our growing knowledge of and experience with these crystalline mineral treasures of the earth in a more intense way, through direct physical contact. At the time we both already had considerable experience with the laying on of crystals, spheres, and tumbled stones in the course of energetic treatments. However, the new element in all of this was the use of crystal wands. Whereas the rounded end of a wand can be used almost like a crystal sphere in massage work, the pointed end can be used to target acupressure points or to trace the meridians. In addition, by means of a simple energetic procedure, one can identify which type of crystal wand is suitable for a particular treatment or application. Massages thus indisputably become more effective. We agreed that a book on this very subject was much needed. Michael Gienger and Ewald Kliegel Crystal wands for massage Crystal wands for meridian treatments Massage with crystals has become a widely acknowledged modality in the field of wellness and natural therapy. Monika Grundmann's book Crystal Balance, and the gem oils she developed, are forging new paths in cosmetics and wellness. Ricky Welch's book Aurum Manus recognized crystals as an effective treatment for tinnitus and migraine, while the book Joya: Crystal Massage for Everyone, written by Michael Gienger and Ulrich Metz, introduced a massage roller invented by Metz that has spread across Europe like wildfire. These are but a few of the many offerings that explore the use of crystals. I now will introduce you to the beautiful and fascinating possibilities of bestowing well-being and good health with crystal wands. 1 Basics DO CRYSTAL WANDS REALLY WORK? What difference does it make whether I carry out a massage with or without a crystal wand? Do they actually work? These are the two questions I hear most often in connection with the use of crystal wands. You can get the answers to both of these questions quite easily by carrying out a simple test on yourself. Everyone's head has reflexology zones (the details of which will be described later in this book). These zones, among other things, are responsible for good blood circulation in the feet. People with cold feet (usually women) may experience a clear improvement in those zones by doing this simple exercise: Reflexology zones for improving blood circulation in the feet First massage the zones shown in the figure on the facing page for about two to three minutes with your fingers. Then repeat the same massage about a quarter of an hour later with a crystal wand made of rock crystal, amethyst, chalcedony, or sodalite. Finally, massage these same zones again half an hour later with a snowflake obsidian wand. Experience has shown that a massage using snowflake obsidian causes the feet to feel warmer soonest. If you try this application again on another occasion and change the sequence, you are certain to achieve the best success with snowflake obsidian. This test demonstrates that your choice of crystal wand clearly influences the effectiveness of the massage. For example, if you have some experience with massage for back problems, you may consider supporting the stroking massage movements by alternating with wands made of aragonite, aventurine, serpentine, or bloodstone. The back muscles will relax much faster and the effect will go much deeper. However, if you use a piece of red jasper or basalt for the same problem, it will take much longer for the relaxation effect to be noticeable. We'll discover why later, when we look at the properties of the various crystals. Reflexology zone massage without a crystal wand Reflexology zone massage with a mahogany obsidian wand Massaging with crystal wands has several immediate advantages. First, as a therapist, we relieve the physical strain on ourself by using a wand\u2014we are being kinder to our hands, our most important tools. But the main reason for using crystal wands is this: the shape of the wand allows us to concentrate the energetic quality of that particular crystal into the areas of the body where it is used, thereby vastly increasing the efficacy and healing potential of the massage. It is, of course, important to choose the right crystal for the purpose\u2014something we will explore in detail a bit later in this book. But, simply put, we want crystals that provide us with three basic qualities: neutral, stimulating, and balancing. Therefore, the basic set for massage with crystal wands includes the following three types: Quartz, otherwise known as rock crystal, which is neutral Red jasper, which is stimulating Aventurine, which is balancing Back massage with serpentine wand A terrific energetic instrument for overworked hands! Crystal wands basic set: red jasper, quartz (rock crystal), and aventurine These three basic qualities can be amplified by fine-tuning with other crystal wands of the same type, and we have approximately seventy different crystal types that fit into one of these three categories at our disposal (see part 3 for a catalog of crystal types). It's all a matter of what is called for in the treatment. Whether the goal is relaxation, composure, heightened awareness, or increased stamina, massaging with crystals brings about a perceptible and characteristic sense of well-being that underscores all the other beneficial effects that can be obtained in a treatment. With crystal wands, the desired state will be achieved more quickly and stabilized more permanently, yielding long-lasting benefits. Last but certainly not least, in addition to enjoying the sheer beauty of crystal wands, we can employ these energetic tools in our daily life for self-massage, to help us feel good and to treat our own little problems and complaints. AESTHETICS AND FORM One might think that aesthetics is not exactly the most important quality in a tool. Its form might suggest its function; however, the flow of energy within an object also depends on its form. With an energetic tool the question of form becomes even more important because of the high energetic potential it carries. When we perceive something as being elegant or aesthetically pleasing, what we are experiencing is a felt sense about the energetic flow within that object. We are familiar with this sensation from the shape or form of landscapes, rooms, or objects. If the form is right, we feel good about it. A crystal wand possesses three qualities in its form that are energetically important: First, there is the round, smooth, polished shape of the wand. Once we hold one in our hands, it's hard to put down. It is such a touchy-feely kind of thing that we want to continuously move it around in our hands, and we feel good doing so. The wand has no edges from which energy can escape sideways. The shape itself contains the energy of the stone used inside the wand, so that its effectiveness is concentrated at the two ends. One end is round and allows us to use the crystal wand as we would a crystal sphere. This is especially useful for massage techniques that use flat movements, in applications where the aim is to distribute energy, or where an excess of energy needs to be conducted away. A different energetic state is applied at the point, which is a softly rounded tip. This is where energy is bundled. If the tip is used to concentrate on one point, zone, or meridian, energy is conducted into the body via that pointed end of the crystal and the energetic state is consequently intensified. When using either end, conducting energy away or conducting energy in, "}
