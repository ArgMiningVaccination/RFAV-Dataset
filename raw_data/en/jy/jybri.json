In other words, specialized supplements are used for every evolutionary stage of disease in the inflammatory procedure, and their action is individualized and targeted. The classic drugs act mainly for the symptom remission of a disease without avoiding side effects, while the bioactive compounds for natural regulating medicine act without side effects with major aim to regulate the human physiology. In other words, specific supplements are used for each evolutionary stage for inflammatory procedure, and their action is individualized and targeted. This new therapeutic approach is friendly towards the cells because the bioactive compounds contained in the supplements are herb extracts, metals or trace elements or others that their concentrations regulate the symptom without side effects.
