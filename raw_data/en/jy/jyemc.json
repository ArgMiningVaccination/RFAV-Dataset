It is tied to the circulatory system, but, despite this relation, it is too often ignored or forgotten. We remember it only when problems with our lymph nodes arise, usually during some type of infection. However, we need to be more familiar with this vital system. The lymphatic system is a part of weight control, the [immune system](https://sunwarrior.com/products/be-well-organic-elderberry-vitamin-c), the cleansing of blood, and the detoxification of our bodies. A huge network of lymphatic vessels recycles blood plasma by removing fluid from the tissues, filtering it, and carrying it back into the bloodstream. Here are 10 foods to incorporate into your diet to boost the lymphatic system: - Water - Cranberry - Leafy greens - Nuts and seeds (like [Chia Seeds](https://sunwarrior.com/products/organic-chia-seeds)) - Adaptogens like [Ashwagandha](https://sunwarrior.com/products/be-well-organic-ashwagandha)or [Mushroom](https://sunwarrior.com/products/be-well-organic-mushroom-blend) - Garlic - Ginger [Turmeric](https://sunwarrior.com/products/be-well-turmeric-capsules) - Seaweed - Citrus Lymphoid tissue is also a part of digestion, absorbing fats from the intestines and transporting it to the blood. It also carries white blood cells throughout our bodies to remove foreign waste and dangerous microorganisms. The lymphatic system is responsible for the removal of waste, toxins, and harmful material/organisms from the tissues, including excess fat. This has a large impact on fat accumulation and cellulite. The problem is twofold. If excess fat is not removed, the body responds by storing more. If toxins are not removed, fat cells come to the rescue and encapsulate the offending matter. Encouraging the storage of unnecessary fat in this form the body will then use it to free up toxins. Getting the lymphatic system healthy and functional can help it better remove the toxic sources of aches, pains, fatty deposits, and cellulite. Start treating your lymphatic system better by avoiding toxins, chemicals, and foods that are hard to digest\u2014that means processed foods that are steeped in pesticides, preservatives, and artificial ingredients. Then begin adding more of these foods to your life. Recommended Products 10 Foods to Add to Your Diet to Boost the Lymphatic System 1. Water Maybe it isn't a food, but it is vital to life.
