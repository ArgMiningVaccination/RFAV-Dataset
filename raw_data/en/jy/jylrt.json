Traditional Philosophy on Acupuncture & Immunity Under traditional acupuncture theory, maintaining uninhibited flow of life energy (or \"qi\"), is key to a healthy immune system.

Through working with the bodies Qi and blood and with the right choice of treatment your immune system will be stronger to ward off colds and flu. Western Philosophy on Acupuncture & Immunity Through contemporary studies, the success of acupuncture in boosting immunity has been attributed to the body's natural response to needles being inserted at specific points.
