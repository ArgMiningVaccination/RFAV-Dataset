Naturopathic Physicians' training involves an intensive and thorough 4 year post-graduate medical school followed by a 2 year residency program in an outpatient setting. Naturopathic doctors utilize a wide variety of treatment to address the physical, mental, emotional, and psychological aspects of illness. These physicians are versed in diet and nutrition, herbs and minerals, the wisdom and techniques of ancient medical traditions (techniques rooted in Asian, Indian, the Middle Eastern and Native American histories), and the scientific techniques and standards of modern medicine. Washington State naturopathic doctors are required to successfully pass an extensive 50 hour state medical board examination before becoming licensed. Similar to medical doctors, once licensed they are then able to perform physical examinations, order diagnostic blood and imaging tests, prescribe pharmaceutical medications, provide prescriptions for massage and physical therapy, provide direction to nurses, write referrals to specialists, perform minor surgery, manipulate joints and the spine, utilize physiotherapy machines, and dispense intravenously nutritional and chelation therapies in an outpatient setting. Naturopathic physicians are the only physicians in the State of Washington who are legally able and encouraged to perform chelation therapy for metal toxicity. The following principles are the foundation of naturopathic medical practice: The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae): Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in the person which is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam): The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere): Naturopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; Avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; Acknowledge, respect and work with the individual's self-healing process. Doctor as Teacher (Docere): Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person:Naturopathic physicians treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Prevention: Naturopathic physicians emphasize the prevention of disease-assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease and making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness.
