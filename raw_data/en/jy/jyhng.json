The reader should be aware that the present study departs in certain major ways from the customary practices of writing dissertations in the field of English and American literature. The study departs from expected academic form in keeping with its particular nature as a speculative activity in symbol construction. The ways in which the study diverges from customary form are three. First, the study does not provide a preliminary discussion of a relevant history of criticism; however, it does distribute a virtually encyclopedic body of relevant traditional and contemporary critical information among its chapter end notes, final evaluative chapter, and -bibliography. This method allows the study both to establish and to maintain its prime focus on symbol construction as a direct response to literary texts. Second, the study does not develop its content by means of highly discursive expository discourse; instead, it relies on highly non-discursive, condensed and formulary verbal statement. This style of thinking and saying permits the study to organize and to treat in detail a large and even comprehensive sampling of literary and related texts-- as in themselves a repetitive yet expansive discourse, upon the study's hypothetical complex of ritual ideas. Third, the study does not provide an easily read typographical surface; on the contrary, it usually offers to its reader an extensively difficult technical surface. The excep- tiona! reliance on features of print and layout works to handicap the ordinary codes of reading, in the study's strategic effort to remark and iii iv to insist upon certain primitive facts of human communication, facts from which the literary language of Hawthorne and literary language in general may draw its deeper powers of resonance and appeal. Being aware of the special features or complexities, the reader may wish to read selectively--from what is effectively a resource study for the development of a future philosophy of literary art. VITA. The author of the study, Asta Kornelija Velitka, is the daughter v v v v of Domas Velicka and Elena (Griskevicius) Velicka. She was born on August 23rd, 1942, in the. City of Taurage, in the Republic of Lithuania. On October 6th, 1944, in the course of the Second Occupation of Lithuania by the Red Army, she left Lithuania with her parents, removing to The West. She began her elementary education in 1946 in the Lithuanian schools of the Displaced Persons' Camps of the American Sector of Occupied Germany (Unterlenningen, West Germany, and Schwabisch GmUnd, West Germany), organized under UNRRA and IRO (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the International Refugee Organi- zation). She began again in 1949 and completed her elementary and her secondary education in the Chicago Public Schools, graduating from Oglesby School in June, 1955, and from Calumet High School in June, 1959. In December, 1963, she graduated from Chicago Teachers College South, with the degree of Bachelor of Education (and a major in General Education); and in August, 1972, with the degree of Master of Arts (and a major in English Language and Literature). In the period 1963-1983, she attended programs of study at Roosevelt University (General and Clinical Psychology, 1965-66), Rosary College (Library Science, 1966-66), Loyola University (Education of the Socially Maladjusted and English, 1968-69 and 1974-83), and The University of Chicago (Comparative Literature and English, 1973-73). In 1968, she completed a teacher v vi preparatory.institute in Lithuanian language and literature, organized by the Cultural Council of the American Lithuanian Community and sponsored by the Lithuanian Jesuit Fathers. Since January, 1964, she has taught in the Chicago Public Schools, Ln the capacities of substitute teacher. teacher of elementary grades 3- 8, high-school English teacher, and teacher of socially maladjusted and emotionally disturbed children and adolescents. At the present time, at Wells High School, she teaches in (and coordinates the supportive services of) a program of instruction and guidance for students with strong potential for dropping out of high school before they have completed the formal requirements for graduation.

The light from the hearth quivered upon the flowers and foliage, that were wrought into its oaken back; and the lion's head at the summit, seemed almost to move its jaws and shake its mane. --Grandfather's Chair, p. 74.1 A. Introduction: The Thesis and Its Development. Might the oral gesture theory of speech and speech origins serve as an approach to literature? In what ways could the theory be sue- cessfully applied? Would the application contribute significant new insights to the scholarship and criticism of literature? Oral gesture theory as developed for the enlightened general reader by Richard Paget in Human Speech (1930; 1963) serves, in the present study, as a successful approach to the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864). But the success of the approach depends largely upon the study's taking, at the outset, a philosophically extreme, topically narrow, analytically self-challenging, subjective position with regard to the nature of Hawthorne's works. Thus, by first taking the position (i.e., here, ~n the introduction prime, and on grounds of long reading familiarity) that Hawthorne's works are the arcane arts- verbal relics of an idiosyncratic creative mind-set (i.e., a character- istic, restricted set of private ideas, used heuristically by the author to stimulate composition and to control style), the study must first 1 2 move to reconstruct that idiosyncratic creative mind-set. In a pre\u00ad liminary, compatibility-suggesting application of general aspects of Paget's motor-analogue theory of meaning in language, chiefly to auxiliary and prefatorial texts by Hawthorne (Chapter I, Parts B-C), three constructs are brought forward as hypothetically fundamental or essential to Hawthorne's idiosyncratic creative mind-set--the chanting mouth, his personal name as public enigma, and f9rmal literary conso\u00ad nance; the constructs are inferentially integrated, in the idea of Hawthorne's name as orally self-translating vital serpent--of Haw\u00ad thorne's signature self-botanizing master-form-with-consonant-chant, the dynamic, all-binding poetic principle of Hawthorne's works, auxiliary through literary. Next, taking a restricted rhetorical position, that Hawthorne's works, as a unified discourse on name, are a private, Christ-confessional chant-petition for immortal life, the study moves to reconstruct the oral-ideal form of that private chant\u00ad petition. In a mediatory application of Paget's theory of consonant gestures (or contactive motor values cued by consonant sounds/signs), chiefly to Hawthorne's text of actual literary signatures (Chapter II), a signature-voicing scale is generated, a tool-construct of five consonant-figures with oral-vegetal extensor-tags, and the construct is tested, for its power to orient or attune the reader to Hawthorne's ever-orally self-fulfilling immortal name, in a preliminary application to his storyteller writings for children and to a related pseudonymous nature essay not as yet attributed to Hawthorne (\"Vegetation about Salem, Mass.,\" by \"An English Resident,\" in Aesthetic Papers, ed. 3 Elizabeth P. Peabody [1849]); the scale is integrally assessed as Hawthorne's life-wisdom-alive book-stave-~the writer's, the reader's, and the book's own key to literary maturation, to literary rights as rites of trans-textual passage. \u00b7Then, taking a fully anthropological position, that Hawthorne's works of literature are the fully burgeoned form of his signature-poetic, with its serpentine heart-demand for public and evident, for Providential, real life-and-death blessings, the study moves into the manifold to sample systematically, of the idiosyncratic oral-consummate (wishful) fruits of that privi-public literary petition. In a classifying and apportioning application of the scale to Hawthorne's literary works (the ninety-two tales, five novels, and six unfinished works, as collected in !Qe Centenary Edition, ed. William Charvat and others [1962- ] ; Chapter III), one hundred and thirty-three passages are concordantly, systematically sampled, or unfolded or read (with interpolated remarks) as a set of five five-fold signature-petitions, for a recurrent, draconic yet undersating all-round haw-in-mouth, five name-anecdote-consonant on--\"Nathaniel Hawthorne\" as Hebraic-Anglic identity, in eternally self-enforcing, mouth-based literary courtship, of American continent, capital, population, culture, and language--or of America's historic gifts-memorial, as trans-historic matrices of contact, for name-immortalizing succor; the set of unfolded signature petitions is appraised, as evidence constituting the higher literary qualification of Hawthorne's signature-poetic, a proliferation of self-re-signing, self-redesigning, with formal Godhead-romancing 4 Miltonic heritage (Nativity Ode, Lycidas, Samson Agonistes, Paradise ~). Finally, taking the implicit critical position, that a success\u00ad ful approach to the arcane prose art of Nathaniel Hawthorne has been achieved (i.e., by means of the preliminary and mediatory application of Richard Paget's oral-gestural linguistic), the study moves to evaluate the wider, ever more universal significance of its special insights into the art of Hawthorne. In a selective review of twentieth\u00ad century Hawthorne studies, nineteenth-century contexts and sources, English literary and critical heritage 1500-1950, and linguistic science past and present as poetic study (Chapter IV): the study suggests that the especial value of its special insights into the oral master-craft of Hawthorne (into the serpentine signature-poetic as oro-genic art of self-ambush and trans-textual aesthetic of semantic-hunger gesturing) may lie in their power to place Hawthorne in an individualistic, sensi\u00ad tive, and possibly underestimated relationship with the philological concerns of the New England of his day; it demonstrates the trans\u00ad contextual power of the consonantal-vegetal scale-Hawthornesque to integrate written texts supportive of such placement; and (recognizing both the power of that construct as perceptual stratagem for examining oral continuities in literary texts and the fact of unextricated values ~n its present re-reading of Hawthorne) the study resolves to investi\u00ad gate scale-correlative linguistic devices for the future reading of texts, devices not out of harmony with its continuing interest in the work of literature as articulatory symbol--anthropological design consonant with contact structures fundamental to living human speech 5 and community life, and with the revolution or maintenance of spe- cialized meanings from that base. B. Development: The Foundations of the Thesis. The study has indicated (in the introduction of the thesis and its development) that a preliminary application of general aspects of Paget's theory of speech, chiefly to auxiliary a~d prefatorial texts by 2 Hawthorne, will serve to bring forward three constructs posited as fundamental to Hawthorne's creative mind-set: (1) the chanting mouth; (2) his personal name as public enigma; and (3) formal literary canso- nance. To be applied are three aspects of theory, which may be identi- fied as follows: (1) Paget's explanation of the rise of language, as given in his summary statement in Human Speech; (2) Paget's opinion of null-success on the scientific recovery of the original sounds of language, as given in the same summary statement; and (3) one of Paget's illustrative formulations of theory, perhaps coming to center itself in the consonant element of speech, and posited as a reasonable strategy for the further study of botanical lexicons.3 As arguments for the elegance of mouth-gesture in the universal signification of mean~ng, Paget's statements of theory will serve to focus analogous, if not identical, sets of attitudes to mouth demonstrated by Hawthorne ~n select passages from auxiliary and prefatorial texts. Passages ~n which Hawthorne contemplates visual images of speakers will come to show his enchantment with speech as a motor-process (a contemporaneous observer of Hawthorne will serve to reinforce that focus). Passages in 6 which Hawthorne darkly posits his name as linguistic origin of his literary universe will come to show his emphasis on the motor-values of words and word-elements (a contemporaneous observer of Hawthorne will serve to reinforce that focus). And passages in which Hawthorne admits to use of consonanc-strategies for signing his thoughts of crees will show his most integral motor-attitude to mouth and to speech-process-\u00ad maintained as a private poetic image of himself, as a \"singular\" image of himself as singer, in which he and his name work as one, master\u00ad keying orally the deep-rhythms of his literary style (a contemporaneous observer of Hawthorne will serve to reinforce that focus4). As argu\u00ad ments which successfully serve to focus Hawthorne's oral-motor mind-set, Paget's statements of theory will be used to introduce the three sections of preliminary development which follow; as arguments which successfully serve to focus only the very basic construct of Hawthorne's creative mind-set, Paget's statements of theory will be referred to and will help guide, in the conclusion of the chapter, a recapitulative discussion, by means of which an assessment will be made of the need for a supplementary application of oral gesture theory. 1. Foundations: The Chanting Mouth. Paget's explanation of the origin of language, as given ~n \"Summary of the Gesture Theory\" in Human Speech, follows a report of research, in which phonetic experiment on artificial resonators has been combined with the comparative study of lexical universals. Giving central importance to the articulatory movements of the organs of 7 speech (and their relation, through positional analogues, or pantomime, to general motor-systems of the body), Paget developes his explanation as follows: Observations as to the actual resonance changes which occur in the production of the vowels and consonants show that we accept as identical sounds which are widely different, provided they are made by similar postures or gestures of the organs of articulation. From this it is argued that the significant elements in human speech ar~ the postures and gestures, rather than the sounds. The sounds only serve to indicate the postures and gestures which pro\u00ad duced them. We lip-read by ear. [Miss Helen Keller, whom I had the pleasure to meet in New York, is able, though deaf and blind, to understand speech quite fluently. She lip-reads by touch, placing two fingers across the speaker's lips and her thumb under his chin.] Not only in the case of the Aryan roots--but in the Semitic, Sumerian, archaic Chinese, Oceanic (Polynesian), etc., North Ameri\u00ad can (Hoka) and South American (Arawak), in modern English, and in the invented words used by children, we fiad the same principle at work. The sound of the word is frequently found to be due to \u00b7 postures and gestures of the organs of articulation which bear a pantomimic relation to the idea or action to which the word refers. From this we infer that human speech arose out of a general\u00ad ized unconscious pantomimic gesture language--made by the limbs and features as a whole (including the tongue and lips)--which became specialized in gestures of the organs of articulation, owing to the human hands (and eyes) becoming continuously occupied with the use of tools. The gestures of the organs of articulation were recog\u00ad nized by the hearer because the hearer unconsciously reproduced tn his mind the actual gesture which had produced the sound. (Paget, p. 174) Not unlike Paget's statement, tn its (suggestive) summation of motor events spread over time, Hawthorne's note on a drawing by Raphael serves to unlock a vision of speech-making, in which the mouth has \"become specialized\" in the aesthetic reordering of body movement. Giving concrete emphasis to small gestures of face and abstract emphasis to large gestures of hand, Hawthorne recapitulates, in his note on a 8 visit to an English museum (1856) a chain of primitive, motor facts of connection and convergence, which (for him) underlie an inferred, poetic state of enchantment by voice. Hawthorne's note reads as follows: From the Bodleian we went to [the Taylor Institute,] which was likewise closed; but the woman who had it in charge had formerly been a servant of Mr. Spiers, and he so over-persuaded her that she finally smiled and admitted us. It would truly have been a pity to miss it; for here, on the basement floor, are the original models of Chantrey's busts and statues, great and small; and in the rooms above are a far richer treasure,--a large collection of original drawings by Raphael and Michael Angelo. These are far better for my purpose than their finished pictures,--that is to say, they bring me much closer to the hands that drew them and the minds that imagined them. It is like looking into their brains, and seeing the first conception before it took shape outwardly (I have some\u00ad where else said about the same thing of such sketches). I noticed one of Raphael's drawings, representing the effect of eloquence; it was a man speaking in the center of a group, between whose ears and the orator's mouth connecting lines were drawn Raphael's idea must have been to compose his picture in such a way that their auricular organs should not fail to be in proper relation with the eloquent voice; and though this relation would not have been individually traceable in the finished pictures, yet the general effect--that of deep and entranced attention--would have been produced. (Hawthorne, English Note-Books [Oxford], RE, VIII, 360)5 Earlier and more direct evidence may be brought forward of Hawthorne's subjective need to reaffirm speech-meanings in terms of the motor-values of the body (oral-specific as well as general). Expressing a basic dislike for giving intellectual advice on literary composition, Hawthorne (in a letter to a contemporary metric poet seeking such advice, 1850) describes the context of bodily confrontation he would require to effect an exchange of thought properly supportive of literary creativity. The relevant passage reads as follows: 9 I am dissatisfied with myself for having undertaken this office, both because I do not perform it well, and because I adhere to my original idea that it is not an office for anybody to under\u00ad take. If we were sitting together by an evening fireside, and you had imparted the poem to me in your own voice and cadences, and with your own explanatory talk; then--aided, too, by a perception of the poet's character--I might get light enough upon the matter to throw some of it back from another point of view. Only in such circumstances, I think, can a man be justifiea in interfering with the process of creation. The requisite of such preliminary criti\u00ad cism is, to have the deepest and warmest sympathy than can co-exist between two perfectly independent perceptions. . 6 (Hawthorne, Letter to Lewis Mansfield, Feb. 20, 1850) Finally, we may infer from a report by a contemporaneous observer of Hawthorne that \"enchantment\" for Hawthorne does mean the oral- binding, the oral-enslaving of both himself and his audience as immediate partner--i.e., so that the literary vision could \"be born.\" In Julian Haw.thorne '-s recollections of his father's reading aloud within the family setting, what chiefly seems to underlie the various effects of worlds formed anew, is Hawthorne's having made \"slight and unobtrusive\" movements with his head--behavior suggestive of articu- latory stresses occurring concurrently within that head. Julian Hawthorne's recollections (1885) read as follows: Both Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne seem to have been born good readers; there were music, variety, and expression in every tone, and the charm of feeling that the reader was in sympathy with the reading. While we were in England, Mr. Hawthorne read to us Spenser's \"Faerie Queene;\" and his children were knights-errant and prin\u00ad cesses for years afterwards. Again, two or three years before his death, he read aloud the whole of Walter Scott's novels, taking up the volumes night after night, until all were completed. That too was something to remember. All the characters seemed to live and \u00b7move visibly before us. The expression of his face changed as he read, in harmony with the speech or the passage. It was very pleasant to see him sitting with a book;. he would settle himself comfortably in his chair, and hold the book open in his left hand, 10 his fingers clasping it over the top; and as he read (whether aloud or to himself), there was a constantly recurrent forward movement of his head, which seemed somehow to give distinctness and signif\u00ad icance to the sentences and paragraphs, and indicated the constant living rapport between him and the author. These movements were slight and unobtrusive, but they were among the things which conveyed to.the beholder that impression of unfailing spiritual vitality and intellectual comprehensiveness which always char\u00ad acterized Hawthorne. (J. Hawthorne, N. Hawthorne and His Wife, II, 8-9)7 For Hawthorne's son as contemporaneous observer, 1n other words, the meaningful stylizations of the vo1ce that enchants belong to the various realities of Hawthorne's head, as it draws upon the motor- values of the body while v1ew1ng the printed text. Thus, we may say that for Hawthorne the development of literature as magical processing of new worlds, and ghostly renewal of old ones, ''becomes specialized\" 1n the gestures of the mouth, which re-call the spectral body of us all, to dance publicly a secret pantomime, which he directs. 2. Foundations: The Enigmatic Name. Paget's opinion of null-success on the scientific recovery of the original sounds of language (or of the.first meaningful elements of speech) occurs in the closing paragraph of his \"Summary of the Gesture Theory.\" There, it serves to counter his own intellectual nostalgia for the recovery of those sounds. Paget closes his summary as follows: The origins of human speech are so remote that, as has been already pointed out, it would be unreasonable to find, now, any traces of the original sounds. The illustrations which have been given above [reconstructed words] (and which, from an anthropolo\u00ad logical point of view are all quite modern) are therefore not put 11 forward as necessarily \"genuine antiques\". word formation by the voicing of unconscious and soft palate gestures has any real existe have operated at many stages in the long his velopment, though always without the consciot exEonents. (Paget, }: Original linguistic operations concern Hawthorne in \"The Custom- House,\" as they concern Paget in Human Speech. But, perhaps unlike Paget, Hawthorne in \"The Custom-House\" actively challeng~s his reader to reconstruct the original sounds of his literature. In that prefa- torial essay, Hawthorne executes an elaborate set of obscure and dangerous motor operations, ~/g-cued, and suggestively near to the deeper than tongue-and-soft-palate gestures which would occur centrally in the oral articulation of his name (\"!!aw\"). For when the obscure motor operations move to climax, in an implied act of \"!!aw~ing up\" over a rotten egg, Hawthorne loses his own head--with the self-amazed recovery of an \"A,\" which will serve as the \"groundwork\" of a novel (The Scarlet Letter, 1850). Hawthorne's enigmatic riddle on his own, orally housed literary origins resolves itself in the idea of his name as the remote goad-and-articulator of his literature--perhaps the predictor, even, of the events of his life (i.e., of his loss of a political appointment as chief customs inspector, which did serve to spur the writing of his first successful novel). The enigmatic \"traces\" of Hawthorne's riddle on his own remote original sounds may be sampled as follows (the italics are mine): 12 It is a little remarkable, that--though disinclined to talk overmuch of myself and my affairs at the fireside, and to my personal friends--an autobiographical impulse~should have taken possession of me I again seize the public by the button to find out the divided segment of the writer's own nature [pp. 3-~ . myself, whose name is seldom heard and my face hardly known.

[pp. 13-14] A gift, a faculty was suspended and inanimate within me. without transforming me into any shape which it would be worth my while to take. But There was always a prophetic instinct, a low whisper in my ear, that, within no long period, and whenever a new change of custom should be essential to my good, a change would come. [p. 26] No longer seeking nor caring that my name should be blazoned abroad on title pages, I smiled to think that it had now another kind of vogue. The Custom-House marker imprinted it, with a stencil and black paint, on pepper-bags, and baskets of anatto, and cigar\u00ad boxes, and bales of all kinds of dutiable merchandise, in testimony that these commodities had paid the impost, and gone regularly through the office. Borne on such queer vehicles of fame, a knowledge of my existence, so far as a name conveys it, was carried where it had never been before, and . will never go again. [ p. 27] ..... I chanced to lay my hand on a small package, carefully oone up ~n a p~ece ot ancient yellow parchment. There was something about it that quickened an instinctive curi\u00ad osity, and made me undo the faded red tape, . w~th the sense that a treasure would here be brought to light. But, I found more traces of Mr. Pue's mental part, and the internal operations of his head, of the venerable skull itself. Mr. Pue's death happened suddenly to take the unprofitable labor off my hands traces about it of gold embroidery This rag of scarlet cloth assumed the shape of a letter.

[p. 41] So much for my figurative self the whole may be considered as the POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF A DECAPITATED SURVEYOR I am a citizen of somewhere else. 9 (Hawthorne, \"The Custom-House,\" pp. 3-45) Earlier and more direct evidence may be brought forward of Hawthorne's literary use of his name as a motor-body (oral specific as well as general). After expressing a basic dislike for having to give up an active boy's life to get his schooling, Hawthorne {in a letter to h~s mother, 1820) demands a context of motor-confrontation, to effect an ingenious apart-coming farewell--as a filial stepping down to kneel within his given name, while raising the family \"Hat\" over his \"torn\" private \"heart.\" Not unnoteworthy ~n the play on signature (as cited and possibly appreciated by George P. Lathrop, 1876) is Hawthorne's sounding of throat-deep and initial consonant h as his central heart- sound, which serves to shoot off or decapitate his name, and to echo throughout the tiers of his mechanical riddle, as a spoken original which magnetically charms many parts. Also not unnoteworthy, in a fragment from another boyhood letter (as cited by Lathrop at the close of his commentary), is Hawthorne's implicit association of a shelfful of fantasized books with his name as their proud, self-proclaimed hewer. Hawthorne's signature-letter to his mother may be sampled (in the con- text of vocational biographical commentary by Lathrop) as follows (the italics are mine): 14 As we have seen [Hawthorne] returned to Salem in 1819, to school; and on March 7, 1820, he wrote thus to his mother:-- \"I have left school, and have begun to fit for College under Benjm. L. Oliver Lawyer. So you are in great danger of having one learned man in your family. Mr. Oliver thought I could enter Col\u00ad lege next commencement, but Uncle Robert is afraid I should have to study too hard. I get my lessons at home, and recite them to him [Mr. Oliver] at 7 o'clock in the morning. Shall you want me to be a Minister, Doctor, or Lawyer? A minister I will not be.\" This is the first dawn of the question of a career, apparently. Yet he still has a yearning to escape the solution. \"I am extremely homesick,\" he says, in one part of the letter; and at the close he gives way to the sentiment entirely: \"O how I wish I was again with you, with nothing to do but to go a gunning. But the happiest days of my life are gone. . After I have got through college, I will come down to learn E--Latin and Greek.\" (Is it too fanciful to note that at this stage of the epistle \"college\" is no longer spelt with a large C?) The signature to this letter shows the boy so amiably that I append it. \"I remain,\" he says, \"Your Affectionate and Dutiful son, and Most Obedient and Most Humble Servant, and Most Hearty -Well-wisher, NATHANIEL HATHORNE.\" A jesting device this, which the writer, were he now living, would perhaps think too trivial to make known; yet why should we not recall with pleasure the fact that in his boyish days he could make this harmless little play, to throw an unexpected ray of humor and gladness into the lonely heart of his mother, far away in the Maine woods? And with this pleasure, let there be something of honor and reverence for his pure young heart. In another letter of this period[] he had made a long stride towards the final cho~ce, as witness th~s extract: - \"I do 110t want to be a doctor and live by men's diseases, nor a minister to live by their sins, nor a lawyer and live by their quarrels. So, I don't see that there is anything left for 15 me but to be an author. How would you like some day to see a whole shelf full of books, written by your son, with 'Hawthorne's Works' printed on their backs?\" -- (G. P. Lathrop, A Study of Hawthorne, pp. 81-83)10 Finally, we may infer from a report by a contemporaneous reviewer of Hawthorne's works that public recognition for Hawthorne as author does mean the oral reception, the oral recapitulation by his reader of both the \"real\" sounds of his name and the rich values of his literary discourse--i.e., so that both he and his name could be grandly borne into life, and on grounds of intrinsic merit. In Park Benjamin's landmark assessment of Hawthorne's identity, the ~eview of early tales (1836) which served effectively to terminate Hawthorne's anonymous period of publication, what chiefly underlies the.critic's power of total apprehension is his capacity to \"taste.\" Benjamin's utterance of recognition reads as follows: We shall not observe the order of the volume [1837 Token] in commenting upon the literary pretensions of the work. The stories are, for the most part, written in a chaste and agreeable style; and are superior, as a whole, to those of any previous American Souvenir. They are as interesting as many others are stupid, which is very exalted praise. . The author of 'Sights from a Stee\u00ad ple,' of 'The Gentle Boy,' and of 'The Wedding Knell,' we believe to be one and the same individual. The assertion may seem very bold, yet we hesitate not to call this author second to no man 1n the country, except Washington Irving. We refer simply to romance writing; and trust that no wise man of Gothan will talk of Dewey, and Channing, and Everett, and Verplanck. Yes, to us the style of NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE is more pleasing, more fascinating, than any one's, except their dear Geoffrey Crayon! This mention of the real name of our author may be reprobated by him. His modesty is the best proof of his true excellence. How different does such a man appear to us from one who ~nxiously writes his name on every public post! We have read a sufficient number of his pieces to make the reputation of a dozen of our Yankee scribblers; and yet, how few have heard the name above written! He does not even cover himself 16 with the same anonymous shield at all times; but liberally gives the praise which, concentrated on one, would be great, to several unknowns. If Mr. Hawthorne would but collect his various tales and essays, into one volume, we can assure him that their success would be brilliant--certainly in England, perhaps in this country. 'The Great Carbuncle' is emminently good; and, like all th~ rest of our author's tales, both here and elsewhere, conveys an important moral. We commend the Editor for his good taste in the seiection of his prose papers, and we can think of only one method by which he can do better than he has done;--this is, next year to employ Hawthorne to write the whole volume, and not to look at it himself till it be for sale by all booksellers in town and country. (Benjamin, from a rev. of The Token for 1837)11 For Park Benjamin as a contemporaneous reviewer, 1n other words, the meaningful stylizations of the voice that enchants belong to the stereognostic realities of Hawthorne's mouth, as a system of self- apprehending, tasteful contacts, communicated across every \"anonymous shield,\" through all levels of veiling text. Thus, we may say that for Hawthorne the development of his capacity to originate literature has been magically fore-cast in the cradle of his name, spoken forth by his name, as spectral body with an oracular set of mouth-parts, to which all the world must come dancing, with praises that mimic, that encour- age, that nurture. 3. Foundations: Formal Literary Consonance. One of Paget's illustrative formulations of mouth-gesture theory 1s posited as-a reasonable strategy for the further study of botanical lexicons. Sufficiently suggestive of consonantal tree-signing gestures as it proceeds, Paget's commentary on his strategy of word-building may 17 be cited (for our preliminary purposes) without the set of tongue-track diagrams to which it makes reference. The commentary reads as follows: [A] series of tongue and lip gestures which may offer an interesting field of study are those suitable for symbolizing the shape of various kinds of plants and trees. In Fig. 96 [tongue-track diagrams]- the attempt has been made to collect together some examples of these gestures which appear reasonably descriptive of the outline of various types of shoot, plant, tree, etc., and to give in each case the type of word which the gesture of articulation produces. The list of gestures might, no doubt, be greatly extended, while the resultant words of the present list must be multiplied many fold so as to include the other gestural equivalents of the consonants named in each case. Thus 1 might in general be replaced by t, n, e, ~and often by r, though the tongue gesture which produces l-is-more truly a pointing up gesture--e.g. for the tip of a branch--may be replaced by ~ or ub; ~--indicating the root of the plant or tree-may equally be g or ~\u00b7 The tongue-track diagrams are divided for convenience into three classes--up, down, and lateral--the lateral movements-\u00ad suggestive of spreading branches--being actually represented by fore and aft movements of tongue and lips. In connection with these spreading branch gestures, it may be pointed out that eril is (substantially) the same gesture as erin, the Sumerian word for cedar, and that sire actually becomes s~ (cf. cedar) if the tongue momentarily closes against the palate on its journey from s to r. 12 (Paget, pp. 146-48) The gestures of a sub-facial speech assert themselves (perhaps more delicately than in Paget's commentary) in Hawthorne's preface to Twice-told Tales (1851). There, they are associated with abstruse thoughts of an aggressively self-unfolding, throat-rooted botany, which (the author implies) is not out of \"consonance\" with his \"name\" (Haw!- King). The enigmatic contours of Hawthorne's private mouth riddle may be sampled as a cumulative array of passages in which Hawthorne re-18 capitulates his emergence from anonymity--i.e., as his own signature speaking and growing stronger. The evanescent, botanical riddle, ~n which signature comes forward to open its mouth, reads as follows (the italics are mine): the obscurest man of letters in America had no incitement to literary effort in a rea\u00ad sonable prospect of reputation or profit; nothing but the pleasure itself of composition [p. 3] if the Author had ever been greatly tormented by literary ambition it must have perished, beyond resuscitation, in the dearth of nutriment. [p. 4] there can be no harm in the Author's remarking the TWICE-TOLD TALES . have the pale tint of flowers that blossomed in too retired a shade to be read in the clear, brown, twilight atmosphere [p. 5] They have none of the abstruseness of idea, or ob\u00ad scurity of expression, which mark the written communications of a solitary mind with itself. They never need translation. It is, in fact, the style of a man of society. Every sentence, so far as it embodies thought or sensibility, may be understood and felt by any\u00ad body, who will give himself the trouble to read it, and will take up the book in a proper mood. This statement of apparently opposite peculiarities leads us to a perception of what the sketches truly are. They are not the talk of a secluded man with his own mind and heart . but his attempts . to open an intercourse with the world. The Author would regret to be understood as speaking sourly or querulously of the slight mark, made by his earlier literary efforts, on the Public at large. Occasionally, a para- graph or an article, from a native or foreign critic, would gratify . with unexpected praise; too generous praise, indeed, and too little alloyed with censure, which, therefore, he learned the \u00b7 better to inflict upon himself. [pp. 6-7] . the author .. on the internal evidence of his sketches, came to be regarded as a mild, shy, gentle, melancholic, exceeding\u00ad ly sensitive, and not very forcible man, hiding his blushes under an assumed name, the quaintness of which was supposed, somehow or other, to symbolize his personal literary traits a natural desire to fill up so amiable an outline, and to act in consonance with the character assigned to him . these volumes have opened the way to most agreeable associations, and to the formation of imperishable friendships; and there are many golden threads, interwoven with his present happiness, which he can follow up more or less directly, until he finds their commencement here; . his 19 pleasant pathway among realities seems to proceed out of the Dream\u00ad Land of his youth, and to be bordered with just enough of its shadowy foliage to shelter him from the heat of the day. better than fame. IP\u00b7 7] 13 (Hawthorne, \"Preface,\" Twice-told Tales, pp. 3-7) Evidence at once more conc1se and illustrative may be brought forward of Hawthorne's special subjective claim upon the consonant elements--i.e., as the sub-facial speech of his self-unfolding, soul- transporting name. In the series of five excerpts which follow, Hawthorne: (i) acknowledges the importance of the articulatory aspects of language for the translator of literary style; (ii) construes the title of his first novel as a show of \"[ j] awi sJ\" (!!) over under folded \"ta[i)l[-),\" with cue to come fishing; (iii) shapes a message of court- ship, from \"heart\" to lips (!!/e), with press to \"nest\" a small kiss Ce/~) within a French 'White-thorn'; (iv) leaps from heart to lips (!!/e) 1n spontaneous anagrams voiced in family setting; and (v) writes 1n meter an early expression of the atonement of all discord, 1n Christ as \"Word,\" dancing His way across the sea to meet the speaker at face, even at lip (~/y/E), level. The series of five passages reads as follows: ( i) Sentiments in a foreign language, which merely convey the sentiment, without retaining to the reader any graces of style or harmony of sound, have somewhat of the charm of thoughts in one's own mind chat have not yet been put into words. No possible words that we might adapt to them could realize the unshaped beauty that they appear to possess. This is the reason that translations are never satisfactory,--and less so, I should think, to one who cannot than to one who can pronounce the language.

In Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's highly receptive review of Hawthorne's collected tales (1837), what chiefly underlies the assessed qualities of stylistic clairvoyance is Hawthorne's successful binding, into active-transgres- sive relation, of seemingly ordinary, inconsequential diction--so that Longfellow must seek meaning ever-elsewhere except in the \"stream of thought.\" The fearlessness with which Longfellow apprehends Hawthorne's powers of linguistic super-ordination arises from his own habits of mind as metric poet; and his long mention of heuristic chanting in the context of commenting on Hawthorne's style (intimating both Hawthorne's use and Hawthorne's mastery of ecstatic rhymes) serves as a verse-poet's salute to Hawthorne, though the latter's poetic mode is prose. The relevant passage from the revLew by Longfellow reads as follows: 22 Another characteristic of this writer [Mr. Hawthorne] is the exceeding beauty of his style. It is as clear as running waters are. Indeed he uses words as mere stepping-stones, upon which, with a free and youthful bound, his spirit crosses and recrosses the bright and rushing stream of thought. Some writers of the present day have introduced a kind of Gothic architecture into their style. All is fantastic, vast, and wondrous in the outward form, and within is mysterious twilight, and the swelling sound of an organ, and a voice chanting hymns in Latin, which need a trans\u00ad lation for many of the crowd. To this we do not object. Let the priest chant in what language he will, so long as he understands his own mass-book. But if he wishes the world to listen and be edified, he will do well to choose a language that is generally understood. (Longfellow, from a rev. of Twice-told Tales Il837J)15 Perhaps even for Longfellow as poet and friend, in other words, the significant locus-of-voice for the stylizations that enchant may lie somewhere beyond the essential clarity of Hawthorne's style; but, though Hawthorne may have a private purpose, along with a private code of formal transcendence, his fundamental use of acceptable standard speech allows even the general reader to find meaning within his text, allows even the general reader to respect himself, allows (that is to say) for the essential conditions of a felt comeraderie, which, con- ducive to a general attitude of receptivity, prepare the way for any special instruction the author may have. Thus, we may say that for Hawthorne the elaborate oral constraint under which he creates (consonance) celebrates his deep private bondage to his given contexts of Providence, contexts certainly not exclusive of his native American language. Those given contexts are consummated ~n the symbol of his name--the infra-identity by means of which he subordinates himself to 23 his own mouth, to extend tree-masked addresses to Super-Nature, in private petition for his and our American welfare, for his and our (undeserved) transfiguration finally, in Christ the Glorious Word. Such is the implicit oral complex, when in the final,.Liberty Tree sequel of The Whole History of Grandfather's Chair, the self-involved lion's head at last breaks its wood-silence; the lion's head then speaks for a \"Heaven\"-directed identity which both transcends and underlies a children's story-teller and his completed stories; it also joins into an all-binding !_/y song--for eye and for ear, from \"my existence o\u00a3 m~re than t!o centuries, you have had ~ familiar intercourse with men who were esteemed the ;ise;t of their day~ inyal~able lesson o\u00a3 wisdom.

Conclusion: The Literary Possibilities of the Thesis and the Needed Tool. In the foregoing, developmental section of this, the first chapter of the thesis, general aspects of Richard Paget's theory of speech, as presented in his Human Speech, have been applied to selected passages from auxiliary and prefatorial texts by Nathaniel Hawthorne, to bring forward and to integrate three constructs posited as fundamental to Hawthorne's creative mind-set: the chanting mouth, his personal name as public enigma, and formal literary consonance. Paget's explanation of the rise of spoken language, applied to passages in which Hawthorne contemplates visual images of speakers, has served to bring forward Hawthorne's enchantment with speech as a bondage to motor-process. Paget's opinion of null-reconstruction of phonetic chronology, applied to passages in which Hawthorne posits his name as significant origin of his literary world, has served to bring forward Hawthorne's empowering of words and word-elements with enigmatic motor-functions. And Paget's strategy of botanical word-building, applied to passages ~n which Hawthorne admits to the consonant-signing of trees, has served to bring forward Hawthorne's most integral attitude to speech as motor-process--\u00b7 maintained as a private poetic image of himself, in which he and his 25 name jaw as one, to master-key from mouth-covert the enchanted manifold which constitutes his literary works. That private poetic image, essentially a symbol of rhetorical power, may be more concisely appre- hended as man-serpent with self-articulating mouth, or as serpent with rhy~hmically branching mouth, or as signature with consonant-chant.17 As signature with consonant-chant, Hawthorne's rhetorical master- symbol promises its consistent, constraining presence throughout the works of Hawthorne, to remind the reader orally attuned: (1) not only of the immortal presence of Hawthorne's name (as the author's remark of victory over literary form); (2) not only of the necessity of the reader's wakeful linguistic presence within his texts (as a living American speaker.of possibly many tongues); but of the potential, radical power of his textual consonants to resolve harmoniously for the reader all literary aspects of his texts which may imperil meaning-- i.e., (3) of the possibility of the reader's triumph over his deep motor-riddles (but with full appreciation of the richness of those riddles), \\4) of the possibility of the reader's concurrence with him as America's literary master (but in mutual reinforcement of a high sense of self-esteem), (5) of the possibility, finally, of the reader's trust Ln his own salvation Ln time (but within the infinite context of Divine Love, which lies beyond all literary and earthly contexts). But perhaps only as a dynamic system of chants and counter-chants, finely attuned to his name, will Hawthorne's textual consonants give to the reader such powers of formal mobility, or of high textual apprehension of what is essentially a private petition by Hawthorne for immortal 26 life. As formal possessor of the signature which gLves life, Haw\u00ad thorne's master-symbol implicates Hawthorne's set of actual literary signatures as a system of chants, or as a master-text by means of which the structure of Hawthorne's consonant-chant may be more finely assessed. Suggestive of a motor-precess of speech (with a hierarchy of emergence, capped by a guarantee of significance broadly cast) Hawthorne's text of literary signatures may be gathered and cited at this time as follows: \"Nathaniel Hawthorne,\" \"Rev. Ashley Allen Royce,\" \"M. Theodore de l'Aubepine,\" and \"Oberon.\"18 In short, if the preliminary application of Paget's oral gesture theory has helped to posit a rhetorical master-symbol for \"'Nathaniel Hawthorne' creating,\" on the basis of which the works of Hawthorne may be construed as a unified discourse on his immortal name, the prelim\u00ad inary application has also served to suggest a necessary further application of that oral linguistic: the application of specific aspects of Paget's theory of consonant sounds, in a mediatory study of Hawthorne's auxiliary text of literary signatures, to facilitate the construction of an ideal consonant tool, by means of which the power of that discourse might be systematically assessed.

Crowley, p. 58. Subsequent bibliogr. references to the observations occur parenthetically within my text; other reports, by contemporaneous and later observers of Hawthorne, are quoted and identified within my notes (i.e., in notes 7[a,b], ll[b], 15[b,i], 17[c,iii,end] and in notes 9[end], ll[a,c], 14[a], 18). Also cited within my notes are general, but applicable, discussions of the anthropology of speech and of the formal aspects of literature (i.e., in notes 13[a-c], 15[a], 16[a], 17[c], 18 and in 5Three other instances (a-c) of Hawthorne's motor-fascination with mouth may be found in The French and Italian Notebooks, Vol. 14 of The Centenary Edition (1980), 92, 334-35, 426-27: (a) \"One [picture] that attracted our attention was a picture of Christ disputing with the Doctors, by Albert Durer, in which was represented the ugliest, most evil-minded, stubborn, pragmatical, and contentious old Jew that ever lived under the law of Moses; and he and the child Jesus were arguing, 29 not only w:ith their tongues, but making hieroglyphics, as it were, by the motion of their hands and fingers. It is a very queer, as well as a remarkable picture. But we passed hastily by this \" (Rome, Feb. 20, 1858); (b) \"I looked again at Michael Angelo's Fates to-day, but cannot satisfactorily make out what he meant by them. One of them--she who holds the distaff--has her mouth open, as if uttering a cry, and might be fancied to look somewhat irate. The second, who holds the thread, has a pensive air, but is still, I think, pitiless at heart. The third sister looks closely and coldly into the eyes of the last-mentioned, meanwhile cutting the thread with a pair of shears. Michael Angelo, if I may presume to say so, wished to vary the expression of these three sisters, and give each a different one, but did not see precisely how; inasmuch as all the fatal Three are united, heart and soul, in one purpose. It is a very impressive group. \u00b7 But, as regards the interpre\u00ad tation of this, or any other profound picture possibly he put forth a riddle without himself knowing the solution \"(Florence, June 21, 1858); (c) \"Italy beats us, I think, in musquitoes; they are horribly pungent little particles of Satan. They possess strange intelligence, and exquisite acuteness of sight and smell--prodigious audacity, and caution to match it, insomuch that they venture on the most hazardous attacks and get safe off. One of them flew into my mouth, the other night, and stung me far down in my throat; but luckily I coughed him up in halves . \" (Florence, Sept. 23, 1858). 6 . Not unrelated to Hawthorne's motor-sense of the self creating are (a) the insights of Hans Jonas, in \"The Nobility of Sight: A Study in the Phenomenology of the Sensesu (1954), from The Phenomenon of Life: Toward a Philosophical Biology (New York: Harper, 1966), as rpt. in The Philosophy of the Body: Rejections of Cartesian Dualism, on the quality of the visual world and the 'quietive' transmutation by which this distillate of reality is obtained; and reference was made to its need for cognitive complementation from other senses and from the sphere of action. We must add that the latter, or the motility of our body generally, is not called in post hoc only but is already a factor in the very constitution of seeing and the seen world themselves, much as this genesis is forgotten in the conscious result. Lest our preoccupation with the finished product in its contemplative 'nobility' be taken as a similar forgetting on our part, some remarks on the role of movement in the production of it are in order. I I We may therefore say that the possession of a body in space, itself part of the space to be apprehended, and that body capable of self-motion in counterplay with other bodies, is the precondition for a vision of the world. We have thus the paradox that it is something dynamic, a process, by which the framework of static experience is constituted, viz., a system of spatial coordinates (directions) with my own body at the 'origin.' And the example of the sense seemingly remotest from such involvement shows that motility, which itself requires sentience for its operation, in turn enters into the very constitution of sense where this is to be more than the mere 30 registering of irritations from without: in other words, where sensa\u00ad tion is to rise to perception. []\" But, (b) Hawthorne's sketch of a talker in an English retirement home intimates that for Hawthorne himself speech movements may predominate in the rise of poetic perception within contexts of bodily counterplay: \"The old soldier and his wife both seemed glad of somebody to talk with; but the good woman availed herself of the privilege far more copiously than the veteran himself, insomuch that he felt it expedient to give her an occasional nudge with his elbow in her well-padded ribs. 'Don't you be so tal\u00a5-..ative!' quoth he; and indeed he could hardly find space for a word, and quite as little after his admonition as before. Her nimble tongue ran over the whole system of life in the Hospital. \" (\"About Warwick,\" Our Old Home [1863], Vol. 5 of The Centenary Edition [1970], 77). 7Four additional characterizations (a-d) of Hawthorne as speaker\u00ad articulator may be cited (in c-d, self-critical remarks by Hawthorne himself [as cited by Randall Stewart] and a compositional note to himself suggest that Hawthorne's most focused practice of oral eloquence may have belonged to the non-public moments of his life--i.e., when he actually created literature): (a) \"His hands were large and muscular, the palm broad, with a full curve at the outer margin; the fingers smooth, but neither square nor pointed; the thumb long and powerful. His feet were slender and sinewy, and he had a long, elastic gait, accompanied by a certain sidewise swinging of the shoulders. He was a tireless walker, and of great bodily activity; up to the time he was forty years old, he could clear a height of five feet at a standing jump. His voice, which was low and deep in ordinary conversation, had astounding volume when he chose to give full vent to it; with such a voice, and such eyes and presence, he might have quelled a crew of mutinous privateersmen at least as effectively as Bold Daniel, his grandfather: it was not a bellow, but had the searching and electrifying quality of the blast of a trumpet.\" (Julian Hawthorne, Vol. 1 of Nathaniel Hawthorne and His Wife [1885], 121-22); (b) \"I am sitting to-day opposite the likeness of the rarest genius America has given to literature,--a man who lately sojourned in this busy world of ours I The portrait I am looking at was made by Rowse (an exquisite drawing), and is a very truthful representation of the head of Nathaniel Hawthorne. He was several times painted and photographed, but it was impossible for art to give the light and beauty of his wonderful eyes. I happened to be in London with Hawthorne during his consular residence in England, and was always greatly delighted at the rustle of admiration his personal appearance excited when he entered a room. His bearing was modestly grand, and his voice touched the ear like a melody.'~ (James T. Fields, Hawthorne [Boston: Osgood, 1876], [ca. April 19, 1857], 'I think my speech was about the best of the occasion; and certainly it was better cheered than any other, especially one passage, where I made a colossus of poor little Mr. Brown, at which the audience grew so tumultuous in their applause, that they drowned my figure of speech before it was half out of my mouth.' But the press, he complains, was guilty of inaccuracy. 31 'The next morning came out the newspapers with vile reports of my speech, attributing to me a variety of farms of ragged nonsense, which (poor speaker as I am) I was quite incapable of uttering . '[] And yet, in spite of his grievance against the reporters, Hawthorne evidently felt a considerable satisfaction in this, his most ambitiocs oratorical effort. He comments judiciously in a letter to Ticknor (April 24): 'I don't in the least admire my own oratory; but I do admire my pluck in speaking at all. I rather wonder at my coming off so well.

Robins acknowledges the linguistic tradition of longing for origins, in A Short History of Linguistics, Indiana U. Studies in the History and Theory of Linguistics, ed. Thomas A. Sebeok et al. (Bloom- ington: Indiana U. Press, 1968), pp. 149-50: \" The origin of language, while for ever beyond the reach of any conceivable linguistic science, has always fascinated linguistically minded people and in different forms bas been a focus of attention throughout recorded history. Psammetichus of Egypt's attempt to discover the 'oldest', i.e. the original, language allegedly by recording an utterance (Phrygian bekos, bread) from a child carefully brought up in a speechless environ\u00ad ment is a forerunner of other similar tales, told of other personages and other languages [Herodotus 2.2]. But several linguistic thinkers of the eighteenth century in different European countries asked and tried to answer the question, what lay between the beginnings of human language and its obviously elaborate present form, and how the seeds of language as it was known in historical times could have been sown in man's prehistory. I Attempts at seriously thought-out explanations of the origin and development of language in mankind, considered as a single species, united philosophers of the eighteenth century and earlier with those working well within the counter-rationalist Romantic movement of its later years and the turn of the century. This is not surprising, since it is in language that men both communicate the collectively accumulated knowledge, argument, and principles of reasoning, such as were held in so high esteem by men of the rationalist Enlightenment, and, equally, give expression to the emotions and individual sentiments on which the Romantics laid such stress. Vernunftmensch, the man of reason, and GefUhlsmensch, the man of feeling, realize themselves through the resources of their language. I Half-way through the eighteenth century [for instance] two French philosophers discussed the origin and early development of human speech. I [E. B. de] Condillac wrote within the rationalist-empiricist tradition, relying a good deal on Locke's theory of knowledge, whereas [J. J.] Rousseau looked forward to the 32 Romantic movement that was to follow; indeed, in many respects he can be said to have been one of its heralds. Their conceptions of the genesis of language were very similar. Language originated in deictic and imitative gestures and natural cries, but since gestures were less efficient as communicative signals the phonic element in human language became dominant, as specific sound sequences were semantically associated with existents and phenomena and as the power of human thought increased. Condillac envisaged a mixed stage in which spoken verb forms were accompanied by gestures indicating time reference, these latter subse\u00ad quently replaced by vocal symbols uttered after the verb itself and finally, in the stage reached by Latin, agglutinated to it. [Essai sur l'origine des connoissances humaines, 1746, 1798]. Rousseau suggested an almost deliberate agreement to make this substitution from gesture to speech on the lines of the social contract [Le discourse sur l'inegalite, 1755]. I \" (Hawthorne's relationship to the linguistic-Romantic contexts is explored in Chapters II and III of my study [notes] and in Chapter IV; (but see deictic-purposive elements and aspects, as past\u00ad future extensions of Hawthorne, in my note 16, also notes 15[d], 17[b, vii, end].) 9The private riddle of \"The Custom-House\" shows, even admits to, traditional process-qualities of (a) RIDDLE, (b) ALPHABET drama, (c) ACROSTIC(H), (d) ANAGRAMMATIC POEM, American Puritan; the actions of the \"figurative self\" demonstrate awareness of temporal expansion, narrative form, as (e) FABLE, (f) FAIRY TALE, (g)_ PARABLE,_ (h) ALLEGORY: (a) \"[RIDDLE] comprises a variety of literary forms that have never been clearly separated. The true riddle compares one object-to another and entirely different one; its essence is the surprise that the disclosure of the answer occasions. E.g., the Humpty-Dumpty riddle describes a fall with a shattering that cannot be put together again, then resolves the contradiction in the answer 'Egg.\" I In the tradition of unsophis\u00ad ticated peoples, riddles of this sort are abundant; in more sophisticated literatures the knack of coining such riddles is almost lost. They are usually presented through an introductory element (a scene, a summons to guess), a descriptive core (which may include a descriptive name like 'Dick Redcap'), a contradictory core, suggesting the act or aspect to be reconciled, and a concluding element (a summons to guess, a promise of reward or punishment). Literary riddles often develop the contradictory at the expense of the descriptive details; they may represent the object as speaking in the first person. Such literary riddles were very popular in Byzantine, early medieval and R[enaissance] L[atin] literature; they have been written by Dean Swift, Goethe, Schiller, Winthrop M. Praed, and continue to be a minor genre. I Many varieties of puzzling questions are called riddles~ There are arithmetical questions, which may be seriously or whimsically intended. Questions about Biblical figures may also appear in serious and whimsical forms, ~, 'Who was born and did not die?' (Enoch). Many of these are ultimately of catechetical origin and may be traced far back in medieval and patristic tradition, as may many of the punning questions and wisecracks that abound today. I There are several specific types of riddle. The Gr. 33 aini~ (enigma) presents in obscure wording what must be solved through grasping associations and similarities; the griphos seems obvious but hinges upon a verbal play or other trick. Decapitation: ~ Take away one letter, I destroy; take two and I die, unless my whole saves me (Ans: Skill). Addition, as with the story compressed in he, her, hero. A rebus is a riddle in pictures, representing phonetically the answer or the syllables of the answer, through the meanings of the separate sounds. The charade is an enigmatic description (written or acted) of a word and its saparata syllables. The popular traditional riddle is ordinarily in prose, although simple rhymes and other stylistic embel\u00ad lishments are readily introduced. The literary riddles usually employ highly sophisticated devices. Riddling is a form of popular entertain\u00ad ment; it amuses the natives of Africa or Asia as it once amused the Gr[eeks] and Rom[ansJ and Anglo-Saxons at their Efforts to use riddles in mythological studies, however, have been largely fruitless. The description of a snowflake as a bird without wings devoured by a maiden without hands (the sun) is probably no more than a riddle; but the picture of the year as a tree with twelve branches probably has mythol\u00ad ogical and cosmological antecedents.

Shipley [1972]); (d) \"[ANAGRAMMATIC 34 poEM, Am. Puritan.] Yet inevitably, no matter how much he might seek to put his composing under the aegis of God as ordered, the Puritan poet found himself in the position of composing on hi.s own--in effect, of composing his sense of what it might mean and be like to compose. I In puritan elegiac poetry, this sense is most e~ident in poems written to anagrams (and sometimes acrostics) on names of men and women, usually those d~ceased. There is, for example, this brief poem sent to Thomas Dudley in 1645: Thomas Dudley ah! old, must dye A deaths head on your hand you neede not weare a dying hand you on you shoulders beare you need not one to minde you, you must dye you in your name may spell mortalitye younge men may dye, but old men these dye must t'will not be long before you turne to dust. before you turne to dust! ah! must; old! dye! what shall younge doe, when old in dust doe lye? when old in dust lye, what N. England doe? when old in dust doe lye, it's best dye too. The irony is one which Dudley must have found quite appropriate--an elegy to one still living, in a manner to assure him that his death was in his life and his life was in death. More important, evidence of death~in-life is discovered, with all seriousness, in the very name of the recipient. Examples, but in most cases poems on those already dead, are abundant enough to indicate that in the anagrammatic-acrostic method the Puritan elegist found his most satisfactory form. [Acrostic poem on \"WILLIAM BRADFORD\" cited.] There are many more--all of them, like the poem on Dudley, attempts by the poet to discover the meaning of a man's life in his name, properly anagrammatized; all of them exhibiting a poet's delight in exercizing his ability not only to discover meaning but to express it: in effect, to discover himself as poet. I By the seventeenth century the anagrammatic and acrostic poem (they were considered as a single class) had come to be taken by English and Continental poets as mere exercises in rhetorical dexterity. I Puritan elegiac poets did not hesitate [to take .. anagrams seriously]. With no need to put on a show of sophistication, they took quite seriousl~ the fact that (composition], without any darkness or difficulty, could bode well. They felt such results appropriate to their own wishes, simply because they were sure that the results were appropriate to God's wishes. The whole Puritan enterprise depended upon man's discovery of God's wishes, his achieving certitude in them, and his rejoicing in that certitude. The Puritan elegist might well believe that in a man's name God had inserted evidence of his nature and his fate [his providence]. When, at his death, that nature and fate were most at issue, what could be more needful than to search out the meaning of that evidence? The search for meaning, indeed, would be per ~ the form and movement of the poem in which the search was carried out. 35 A little recreation of poetry, then, would be what the Puritan most wanted: a re-creation of God's way with His New England people. I Fallen man, so the Puritan believed, could do nothing on his own to alter his fate, but he could seek to understand that fate and so come to see the sublime pattern of necessity whereby God had decided upon it \" (Roy Harvey Pearce, from \"The Elegy and the Structure of Puritan Life and Art,\" in The Continuity of American Poetry [Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Univ. Press, 1961], pp. 28-32; Pearce is also cited in note 14[a]; see also 15[a]); (e) \"[FABLE], Aesopic. Certai..\"'l traditions, combined with the discovery in recent times of typical fables in early cuneiform texts, make it probable that Greece was indebted in some measure to the Babylonians and Assyrians for the type of fable associated with Aesop, himself a native of Asia Minor in the 6th c. B.C. Before Aesop, beast fables are found in Hesiod (8th c. B.C.) and Archilochus; some 15 in all occur in Greek literature before 300 B.C. 'About that time the first written collection was made, intended for the practical use of writers and speakers. Thereafter similar prose collections, partly extant, of greatly expanded content, and ascribed to Aesop by their unknown compilers, were made throughout antiquity and later. Not until the verse compositions of Phaedrus and Babrius in the 1st c. A.D. did fable-writing attain rank as belles lettres. The L. tradition of western Europe stems largely from Phaedrus and his paraphrasers. Aesop himself wrote nothing; he was famed for using fables, partly in lieu of free speech., in the intercourse of real life. I With some exceptions, wherein wit or amusement is uppermost, Aesopic fables are paraenetic in aim and spirit. They convey a principle of behaviour through the transparent analogy of frankly fictitious, though plausible actions of animals, men, gods or inanimate things. Animals act according to their nature, save that they have speech. The motifs are numerous and derive partly from folklore, partly from sophistic invention. The outlook is realistic and ironical. (Cp. Fairy-Tale.) Typical themes are: the folly of sacrificing a small gain already achieved in the hope of winning a larger one, of never being satisfied, of trying to appease the ruthless, of showing mercy to the merciless, of the weak expecting to deal on equal terms with the strong, of unjustified presumption, of yielding to flat\u00ad tery, of deserting one's own nature or calling; the irony of setting a snare for others and falling into it one's self, or the small and clever triumphing over the physically strong. I In structure, the fable is always epigrammatic; it frequently ends with a significant utterance by one of the characters. The application of fables used in a context is usually, and in the early period always, specific or persona; whereas the generalized 'moral,' or epimythium, introduced at the end by such phrases as 'this fable teaches,' originated in collections of fables without context, and therein mainly through confusion with the promythium, the purpose of which, as a prefatory statement of the fable's meaning and potential use, was not to explain but only to classify. The fable collection was originally a work of reference .. \" (B. E. Perry, in Diet. of World Lit., ed. Shipley [1972]); (f) \"[FAIRY TALE].

The fairy tale's miracles occur on the material plane; on the spiritual plane (affections; characters; justice, love) law abides: Prince Charming, changed to a bird, flies to his love and sings to her. In the fable, a shrewd or practical realism reigns: the cheese drops, the fox cannot reach the grapes, persuasion is better than force: the best policy reaps its reward. In the fairy tale, the youngest son, the ugly duckling, the Cinderella, submits patiently until Heaven (in the shape of the fairy godmother) stoops to virtue's aid.

He was one of that race of intolerant Puritans who meant to remain masters, after God, of the land they had chosen. Born on July 4, under the sign of Independence, Nathaniel was almost bound to dedicate a cult to the memory of such an ancestor. William Hathorne's name, however, can also be construed as a synonym for persecution. For the great early Puritans . , the ideal of 'purity' went hand in hand with political and religious 'purging,' even if the purging had to be carried out by fire and sword.[] William Hathorne's 'pitiless severity' toward the Quakers is still famous.[] His son, Judge John Hathorne, flourished at the period when New England was 'purging' itself in Salem by hanging and burning its witches. Later, the Hathornes slipped from positions of high office into oblivion. Was this the result of a curse hurled upon them by a witch from the scaffold, as ancestral tradition had it? Hawthorne himself claimed to believe this legend, and\u00b7, perhaps, obscurely, he really did. In 1808, Captain [Nathaniel] Hathorne died of yellow fever in Dutch Guiana. His brother Daniel having been wrecked in 1805, the Hathornes disappeared from the seafaring world and ceased to belong to the Salem aristocracy. They were left with no heritage but the family curse and a future with little promise of glory. I For Nathaniel, the curse manifested itself in the first place as the void left within him by the memory of a mysterious friend once glimpsed by chance during a ship's call, and whose insufficiently defined image would never enable him to represent to himself in any satisfactory fashion the father, the protector he was always to lack. He piously preserved a logbook kept by this vanished figure during a voyage to the Far East, a sort of testament bequeathing to the boy a nostalgia for the sea, for travels, and for those exotic paradises with their strange blooms that Puritanism had laid beneath its ban. This small black book, whose nautical expressions became so many incantatory formulas which the boy repeated to himself aloud and copied out in the margins,[] with which he intoxicated himself so deeply that he even spoke of sailing away and never coming home,[] thus betraying his obscure desire to identify himself with the dead man, this little handwritten volume is a symbol, doubtless unrecognized by the future writer but nevertheless real, of his profound vocation. By seeking a 38 talisman in those rhythmically repeated and copied words he was already, even at that age, unwittingly enclosing the actually experienced adventure within the magic circle of the library.\"; (b) \"It was during the year 1813 that the accident happened. One day, in the school playground, while playing a sort of baseball called at that time 'bat and ball,' he hurt his foot. The causes of the accident still remain unexplained.

Yet he was to display uncommon agility as an adolescent. Whatever it was, however, this illness was to have a profound and lasting effect on him. The original accident occurred at an age when children undergo a physiological revolution. But in Nathaniel it was the psychological revolution that was to prove infinitely more important. This dramatic halt forced upon a life still scarcely begun, this total ,idleness imposed upon an individuality still in formation, was heavy with consequences, with threats and promises. Those three years spent living an abnormal life were to lead to the abnormal development of a single dominant faculty [i.e., the literary imagination]. I For months, the limits of Nathaniel's life were those of the Manning house. His walks consisted of no more than a few steps on crutches in the garden next to that of the old house now standing empty on Union Street.

The miseries of authorship he came to know first-hand, and the acquaintance began long before and persisted \u00a3ar after he had, in the 1837 Twice-told Tales, modestly succeeded in his efforts 'to open an intercourse with the world.'~] In the ten or twelve years prior to 1837 Hawthorne, determined from the start to publish in book form, planned three collections of short fiction--'Seven Tales of My Native Land,' 'Provincial Tales,' and 'The Story Teller'--none of which came to realization.[] By the end of this period he had instead separately published, anonymously or under a variety of signatures, over forty tales and sketches in newspapers, magazines, and gift-book annuals. I Little is known about just when Hawthorne began to write tales and sketches and what the conception and makeup of his first projected collections were. I I Given the opportunity at last to publish a volume under his own name, Hawthorne not only took great care in selecting 'such articles as seemed best worth offering to the public a second time,'[] out also made many thoughtful revisions in preparing printer's copy.

It is the production of ''Nathaniel Hawthorne\"--whether true or fictitious name, we know not--probably the latter:'[] Seen in the context of an \u00b7 aesthetic that defined 'higher fiction' as personal spiritual autobio\u00ad graphy addressed intimately to a large audience, the notice dramatizes the crucial meaning that the long years of anonymous magazine publication 41 had for Hawthorne. ~ The effe~ts of Hawthorne's art of his having published a collect~on of fict~on seem at best mixed. He was beginning to shed anonymity--many of his new pieces were identified as his either as author of his collection or by his signature. Yet writing for periodicals continued to be unremunerative and unsatisfying. If, despite disappointing sales of the volume, he was stimulated enough within the next two years to publish twenty-two tales and sketches, many of them seem to suffer a diminution of imaginative power. [] I Hawthorne [i.e., in the time since 1836], appeared in the American Monthly, March, 1838, under the pseudonym of 'Ashley Allen Royce.' I Other than [the] children's books [Grandfather's Chair, Famous Old People, Liberty Tree, and Biographical Stories for Children], Hawthorne published only one new tale between January, 1839 and May, 1842--'John Inglefield's Thanksgiving,' in the Democratic Review for March, 1840, under the pseudonym 'Rev. A. A. Royce . ' [] These were the years of his courtship [of Sophia A. Peabody], when his literary productivity was at its ebb. If the books for children bespeak a general winding down of his most serious artistic energies, they are also among the projects whose purpose was to make his marriage economi\u00ad cally feasible. I I Sales of the new edition [two-volume second edition of Twice-told Tales, 1842] were even less satisfactory than the 1837 volume's had been. By the spring of 1844, Hawthorne was considering. the suggestion of O'Sullivan that the remaining copies be bought up for reissue in a false edition. Hawthorne concluded [in a letter to Hillard] by venting his frustration: 'I wish Heaven would make me rich enough to buy the copies for the purpose of burning them. This humbug of a new edition is not pleasant to my feelings. I Poe introduced Hawthorne's name to the large subscription list of Graham's Magazine with two reviews in quick succession [1842]. I But Hawthorne's problem lay in those 'discerning minds' that Longfellow spoke of. There were so few of them. [A]llusions to the enormous popularity of Dickens [by Duyckinck and Orestes Brownson] failed to arouse a wider audience, and gradually the stage was set for Poe, in a reversal of his earlier opinion, to pro\u00ad nounce that 'if Mr. Hawthorne were really original, he could not fail of Making himself felt by the public. But the fact is, he is not original in any sense.'[] As Hawthorne recorded in his 1851 preface-rto the Twice-told Tales], he could not regard himself at this period 'as addressing the American Public, or, indeed, any Public at all. He was merely writing to his known or unknown friends.' I Most of the reviews --Poe's are the exception--were still devoted to defining the quality of Hawthorne's mind and measuring him in terms of a literature of sensibil\u00ad ity. His humor and his pathos were invariably mentioned. But beneath all the praise was a steady undercurrent of references to what eventually was regretted as Hawthorne's lack of range. I [T]he question of monotony [or monotone] grew into a major point of contention and finally received its classical expression in Poe's November 1847 review. Seeing an abominahle 'strain of allegory' as its cause, Poe felt he had solved the riddle of Hawthorne's lack of popularity: 'The \"peculiarity,\" and 42 ithout reference to what is the peculiarity, suffice to deprive him of ~1 chance of popular appreciat\u00b7ion.' Poe's reviews had added a signifi\u00ad cant dimension to Hawthorne criticism in that they were based on formalistic\u00b7concerns rather than moralistic or rhetorical considerations. \" (J. Donald Crowley, \"Ristorical Connnentary,\" Vol. 9 of our favorite strolls was in a sparsely settled street by the riverside [the Androscoggin River]. There, after tea, Hawt:horne and I often walked, silent or conversing, according to the humor of the hour. These rambles sometimes ended at the unpainted cottage of an old fortune teller who, from the tea-leaves in a cracked cup or from a soiledpack of cards, evoked our respective destinies. She always gave us brilliant futures, in which the most attractive of the promised gifts were abundance of gold and great wealth of wives [for a small silver coin. ] I always foretold his success if he should choose literature as a profession. He listened without assenting, but, as he told me long afterwards, he was cheered and strengthened in his subsequent career by my enthusiastic faith in his literary powers. [ .. ] The professors and students all acknowledged his superiority in Latin and English composition, yet to me he insisted that he could never bring himself into accord with the general reading public, nor make himself sufficiently understood by it to gain anything more than a beggarly-support as an author. It was this distrust of being right\u00ad fully appreciated that, for so many years, prevented him from taking that rank among the foremost writers of America which scholars and critics now concede to him. [ . Also:] In a letter of Miss Peabody . it is stated that 'his classmates called Hawthorne \"Oberon the Fairy\" on account of his beauty, and because he improvised tales.' It seems a pity to spoil so poetic a fancy; but if truthful narrative is required, the cold facts are these: In reality the pseudonym of 'Oberon' was not given to him by his classmates or by any one else while in college, but was assumed by him at a late date and in this wise. Soon after graduation we agreed to correspond regularly at stated periods, and we selected new signatures for our letters. Hawthorne chose that of 'Oberon' (which he afterwards used for some of his magazine articles), while I took the more prosaic one of 'Edward.' [ .. ] While in college and for some years afterwards he spelled his name without the ~\u00b7 On first seeing the improved signature, I wrote him that it was suggestive of a fat legacy, to which he replied that he had been blessed with no such luck, though he would gladly take every letter in the alphabet for a thousand dollars each. He added that, in tracing the genealogy of his family, he had found that some of his ancestors used thew, and he had merely assumed it. [ . ] Later, he sometimes took the signature of 'L'Aubepine' ... \" (Horatio Bridge, at least a half-dozen letters to Sophia Peabody (Love Letters, I, 190, 214, 240; II, 61, 68, 100) NH signed the 'frenchified' form of his name given him by Schaeffer [teacher of French, in July 1837], and thrice expanded it to Theodore de L'Aubepine.

Simpson, ed. \"Explanatory Notes: 46.18,\" The American Notebooks, Vol. a of The Centenary Edition [1972].

Poe's use. 12 For Paget, in other words; the strategy which serves to accommo- date with comfort his apperceptions of botanical form--its line, amplitude, and differentiation--serves to produce what is perhaps essentially a consonantal set of defining values. Even as he proceeds to offer comparative proof for the universality of two of his synthetic lexical particles, Paget continues to remark on what may be essentially the base power of the strategy: the consonant gesture as deep-motor value, strongly demarking because \"produced by the total or partial closure and release of the mouth\" (Paget, p. 100). Cf. a historically earlier discussion of the powers of the consonant, esp. in lexical process (by Charles Kraitsir, in Glossology: Being a Treatise on the Nature of Language and on the Language of Nature [New York: Putnam, in Chapters II [notes] and IV of my study--to J. Grimm as well [see my note 9(f)]; Kraitsir' s consonant-specific use of the notion \"germ\" has echoes in Hawthorne [see 14]): \"All speech sounds are divided into two classes, viz. Vowels and Consonants. This division is made by a mental analysis (unloosening) of the natural tie, which connects the sounds into a really undivided unity. I When the parts of the mouth do not touch one another, but are only more or less contracted, thus modifying the tube through which the voice issues from the larynx into the atmosphere, either by the lower passage of the mouth, or by the upper of the nose;--we produce Vowels ([phoneenta, i.e., stoicheia], elements [Gr.]). I When the parts of the mouth do touch one another, more or less, so that the current of the expired air is either entirely interrupted or allowed to escape through a small aperture; --we utter articulated sounds, which are commonly called Consonants ([symphona]). The parts of the mouth, which thus modify the voice into decidedly organic sounds, are the organs of speech, in a strict sense. I I All speech sounds are called articulate by some writers. But it is preferable to restrict this appellation to the so-called consonants, and to distinguish the vowels by the epithet musical. For, the latter can be produced by musical instruments .. articulate may go with organic, and both may be more strictly applied to the consonants; in whose production the limbs of the machine, by which speech is wrought, are more active than they are in the modification of the voice into specific vowels. I I ... the Vowels are not significant of clear conceptions .. They are, nevertheless, a necessary part of language. Without their concurrence no consonant could be audibly uttered, still less conveyed to a distance required by the ends of speech. They are, so to say, the cellular tissue of 44 language, the potential element of the genesis of the consonants them\u00ad selves. I . . . . . scrut~nize (apply a screw=search) them. I ....

I \" Cf. a very recent -- discussion of the powers of the consonant (by Roman Jakobsen and Linda Waugh, in \"Quest for the Ultimate Constituents,\" The Sound Shape of Language [Bloomington and London: Indiana Univ. Press, 1979], pp. 85-86); the discussion indicates preference for auditory neurological explanation of consonant-demarkativity (i.e., over motor neurological)--a position challenged by other recent researchers (e.g., P. Ladefoged [1967]--see my Chapter IV, End Notes.l6): \"The traditional etymology of the Sanskrit name for consonant, vyanjana, as 'revelative' seems to carry the 'sugges\u00ad tion that the consonants rather than the vowels are responsible for the differentiation of meanings' ([W. S. Allen, Phonetics in Ancient India (London, 1953), p. 81]). And in fact the higher informativeness of consonants is a widespread phenomenon which finds expression in those alphabetic systems limited to signs for consonants only. In children's' language the sense-discriminative role of consonants as a rule antedates that of vowels (i.e., oppositions within the consonantal system appear before those in the vocalic system). The primarily consonantal encoding 45 of meanings~ far from being confined to such extreme cases as the caucasian Ubykh language with-its two.:.. or three-vowel . (Oslo, 1963), pp. 13 ff.]), shows up also in English. It is noteworthy that the authorities of acousti~ laboratories in the United States were ready to disclose the images of vowels in the 'visible speech equipment,' whereas those of consonants were concealed until the end of World War II in order to hinder the deciphering of secret messages. Yet it is precisely the rich and semantically revealing class of consonants which still provokes complaints from acousticians because of the difficulty of determining the common essence of the consonantal feature. The attempt by Hugo Pipping (1864-1944) to define the common denominator of the consonantal phonemes still remains the most realistic. According to him~ 1 all consonants carry a. noise element. In fricative,s it is inherent in the continuant noise, in nasal stops and laterals it is contained in the temporal contrast between sound segments with different excitation patterns along the basilar membrane. The sudden transition has the effect of a step excitation of the peripheral receptors which in turn is associated with a specific auditory quality.'

The tongue twister proper is not merely an amusing sentence in which all words begin with the same letter, as many seem to think. It may be a 46 sentence or stanza, a whole poem or only a word, but it must be difficult to repeat aloud rapidly several times because the succession of initial consonants or consonantal combinations is suddenly slightly varied to trip and tangle unwary tongues. In the southeril states they are aptly called 'cramp words.' I .... I An anonymous New Yorker said that frequently those who are given auditions for the stage must repeat: I Three gray geese in the green grass grazing; I Gray were the geese and green was the grazing, I and a Metropolitan Opera star told me rather acidly that tongue twisters might be a plaything and a joke to me but they were literally a pain in the neck to her, as they were a monotonous requisite of her daily practice grind.

Purely as or~l tradition rimes they are folklore, of course, but when they are said to work cures, they verge on the mantric as well and are doubly interesting. I Certain twisters are even dangerous, they say. A California woman claims that when she repeats: I Ninety-nine nuns ran ninety-nine miles in Nineveh, I lingering on the nasal N sounds, her dog always promptly bites her.

Similarly, meter may (Coleridge; Yeats) lull the mind into 'a waking trance. ' It may also serve as a frame, to provide psychic distance: (J. M. Murry) \"There is a background of metrical sameness separating us like a curtain from the practical world; there is a richness of rhythmical variation to make the world in which we are, worthy of attention.' Thus lulled into the poem's mood, our sensitivity to the poet's ideas and images is increased. I Meter may either flow with the meaning, or by its movement challenge the sense. I Meter and metrical form have been used to refer both to the foot-pattern and to the line of so many feet; usually, to the simple unit of the foot, composed of a certain number of syllables in a given order.

In Gr. verse 'arsis' meant the raising of the foot in marking time, at the first syllable of a metrical foot; 'thesis' meant the lowering at a sequent (and presumably stressed) syllable. In L. usage, the raising and lowering of the voice; hence 'arsis' came to indicate the stressed, 'thesis' the unstressed, part of the metrical foot; this sense is preserved in modern usage. The stress itself is called 'ictus'; often this metrical ictus does not correspond with the normal word-accent. This lack of accord was a bugbear with the Eliz[abethan] poets . In addition to (1) word accent and (2) metrical accent, (3) rhetorical accent may be a factor in pronunciation, as determined by intention. Thus 'We have~ our work done' means we secure some one to do it; 'We have our work done~' means it is completed. W. S.

Pearce in my note 9[d]); seven passages from auxiliary and prefatorial texts by Hawthorne constitute (b,c) an assessment which actually mirrors (b,i-iv) a chain of perfecting causes, regressing to a secret locus within and (c,i-iii) a set of derivative speeches--on stru_s\"tural con_sord by means nominal annihilation--grown from a reptilian-pronoun~ing within: (a) \"---.-- -Fanshawe thus was on the whole cordially received--but by gift-book ladies like Mrs. [Sarah J.] Hale [editor of Ladies' Magazine]. Indeed, the cordial reviewers together 'placed' the book with some exactitude-\u00ad as did the bored }f..r. [Joseph] Buckingham [editor of New England Galaxy]. It was a conventionally compounded narrative, with appropriate echoes of Scott and the Gothic romancers, 'comical' interludes, convention&l hyperbolic passages on 'nature,' and the sort of plot in which everything and everyone at the end assumed a proper place in the American scheme of things. Harley College represem:s Bowdoin [Hawthorne's school], and the rusticity of the scene is of a piece with the rusticity of the minor characters. Against the scene and minor characters are placed the benign college president, Dr. Melmoth; his beautiful ward, Ellen Langton; and her two suitors--Edward Walcott, quintessentially the extrovert, and Fanshawe, quintessentially echo of Haw\u00ad thorne's ownname in \"Fanshawe\"?) The problem is to bring Ellen and 49 Fanshawe together and yet keep them apart, for it will not do to let a youth like Fanshawe, so anomalous in American society, win Ellen. The conventions of popular American fiction in the 1820's demanded that the man of deep thought and imagination be given his due but not his woman. The pLoblem is solved by bringing in a villain (all the more deliciously villainous by virtue of the sentimental scene at his dying mother's bedside) who kidnaps Ellen, hoping thereby to secure her fortune, removes her to a mysterious cave, and seems to be threatening to rape her. Walcott is off iu not pursuit of the pair; but it is Fanshawe who saves her and witnesses the villain's accidental death. She offers her hand to him; but he knows he must decline it. Having done so, he returns to the life of s\u00b7tudy which is to hasten his death, while at the end Walcott marries Ellen, and life goes on as unterribly as so many of his contemporaries insisted it had to in America. I One can argue that Fanshawe, crude as it is, does contain the germ of much of Hawthorne's later works.[] \u00b7But, in view of Hawthorne's unhappiness over the book, it is important to observe how insistently Fanshawe is of a piece with the sort of fiction written by that 'd--d mob of scribbling women' (Mrs. Hale was one of them) whase work later so infuriated him. For all its forced, wild inventiveness, it exhibits an incapacity to take the imaginative seriously, a. defect which characterizes much popular fiction of the time.[] \"(Pearce, \"Introduction,\" Fanshawe, in Vol. 3 of The Centenary Edition [1964], 305-6); (b,i) Man's finest workmanship, the closer you obserVe it, the more imperfections it shows; as in a piece of polished-steel a microscope will discover a rough surface.

But, was there ever such a weary delay in obtaining the slightest recognition from the public, as in my case? I sat down by the wayside of life, like a man under enchantment, and a shrubbery sprung up around me, and the bushes grew to be saplings, and the saplings became trees, until no exit appeared possible, through the entangling depths of my obscurity. And there, perhaps, I should be sitting at this moment, with the moss on th.e imprisoning tree-trunks, and the yellow leaves of more than a score of autumns piled above me, if it had not been for you. For it was through your\u00b7interposition,--and that, moreover, unknown to himself,--that your early friend was brought before the public, somewhat more prominently than theretofore, in the first volume of Twice-told Tales. Not a publisher in America, I presume, would have thought well enough of my forgotten or never noticed stories, to risk the expense of 51 print and paper; nor do I say this with any purpose of casting odium on the respectable fraternity of booksellers, for their blindness to my /wonderful merit.

The Sanskrit term veda meant a collection of such lore, especially sacred knowledge, and the four great Vedas of the Brahmans were composed, the Rig-Veda of lore of hymns, the Sama-Veda of lore of chants, the Yajur-Veda of lore of prayers and formulas recited at sacrifices, and the cruder Atharva-Veda of the multi\u00ad varied lore of the Atharvans or fire-priests. The holy verses, sacred texts, stereotyped petitions and formulas from all four vedas were called mantra. I The second and more limited meaning of the word is in the sense of password or formula of initiation. No ~ (teacher) admits a chela (novice) into a Hindu sect without whispering into his ear the mantra or countersign of the order. The Ramanuja mantra was 'Om Ramaya nama!}. (So be it! Reverence to Rama.) Comparison is obvious with the Christian triune formula of initiation repeated by the priest or minister at baptism: In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti (In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost), and with the corresponding ~slem bismillah: bismillahi-r-raOmani-r-ra~Imi (!n the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful), which Mohammed carefully modeled along Christian and Jewish mantric lines. I The use of mantra as a prayer gives it a third or supplicatory meaning apart from its initiatory function. In India, for many centuries, no public religious 52 ceremony nor any private devoti.on in the home has been complete Without the recitation af familiar mantras, which somewhat resemhle Christian prayers. They are not of the extempore original sort, nowever,.fostered in Protestant prayer-meeting circles, but are standardized, verbatim, and repetitious. In fact, any form-prayer of any religian is a true mantra. I The fourth and commonest meaning of mantra, and passibly its oldest, is in the sense of spaken or written charm, spell, incantation, or magic word. ([cf.} ABRACADABRA.) In Hinduism and in theistic Buddhism. (where dharani is t\u00b7n.e 'WO\u00b1\"d often used for mantra} this idea of the magic potency of certain words themselves, even if not understood by him who says them, has long obtained. It is believed that ~ or ~. for instance, represents onomatopoeically the very hum of th~ universe, and if caugh.t into a written er preferably vocalized syllable, its power is absorbed into the worshipper or he into it. I I The phrases used in blessing, cursing, and exorcising are in this sense mantras, and so indeed is prefanity. The Bible is full of mantras, from the imprecatory psalms to the apastolic benedictions. I Rismallah, along with the Hebrew tetragrammaton JHVH and the Christian ICHTHUS, IHS, and XR, passed into folklore with any legends of the-magic power and prophylact\u00b7ic efficacy of the words alone. For one example, in north African Islam it is believed that Allah himself wrote 'bismallah' on Adam's breast, Gabriel's wing, Solomon's seal, and Jesus' tongue. I When the name of God is used purely as a mantric incantation or charmed spell, it ~s obvipus that Christianity, Judaism, and Islam have thereby in that practice reverted to the primitive idea that to know the correct esoteric name of the deity and pronounce it properly is to have him under your control as a sert of genie who must therefore perform your will.\" (Charles F. Potter, in Stand. Diet. of Folkl., Mythol. , and Leg., ed.

M.::: home of Hawthorne]. They begin in October, 1842. I ' ... Mr. Hawthorne's abomination of visiting still holds strong, be it to see no matter what angel. But he is very hospitable, receives strangers with great loveliness and graciousness. Mr. Emerson [:Ralph Waldo E.] says his way is regal, like a prince or general, even when at table he hands the bread. Elizabeth Hoar remarked that though his shyness was very evident, yet she liked his manner, because he always faced\u00b7 the occasion like a man, when it came to the point. Of what moment will it be, a thousand years hence, whether he saw this or\u00b7that person? If he had the gift of speech like some others--Mr. Emerson, for instance--it would be different, but he was not born to mix in general society. His vocation is to observe and not to be observed. Mr. Emerson delights in him; he talks to him all the time, and Mr. Hawthorne looks\u00b7 answers. He seems to fascinate Mr. Emerson. Whenever he comes to see him, he takes him away, so that no one may interrupt him in his close and dead-set attack upon his ear. Miss Hoar says that persons about Mr. Emerson so generally echo him, that it is refreshing to him to find this. perfect individual, all himself and nobody else. 'He loves power as little as any mortal I ever knew; and it is never a question of private will between us, but of 53 absolute right. His conscience is too fine and high to permit him to be arbitrary. His will is strong. but not to govern others. He is so simple. so transparent. sa just, so tender, so magnanimous, that my highes~ instinct could anly correspond w~th his will. I never knew such delicacy of nature. His panoplyof reser-Ve is a providential shield and breastplate~ I can testify to it now as I could not before. He is completely pure from earthliness. He is under the dominion of his \u00b7 intellect and sentiments. Was ever such a union of power and gentleness, softness and spirit, passion and reason? I think it must be partly smiles of angels that make the air and light so pleasant here. My dearest Love waits upon God like a child '\" (J. Hawthorne, citing Sophia Hawthorne, in Vol. 1 of N. Hawthorne and His Wife [1885], 270-72); (b,ii) \"[Hawthorne writes:] People that had.lighted on a new thought, or a thought that they fancied new, came to Emerson, as the finder of a glittering gem hastens to a lapidary, to ascertain its\u00b7 quality and value. I For myself, there had been epochs of my life, when I, too, might have asked of this prophet the master-word, that should solve me the riddle of the universe; but now, being happy, I felt as if there were no question to be put, and therefore admired Emerson as a poet of deep beauty and austere tenderness, but sought nothing from him as a philosopher. It was good, nevertheless, to meet him in the wood-paths, or sometimes in our avenue, with that pure, intellectual gleam diffused about his presence, like the garment of a shining-one; ~nd he so quiet, so simple, so without pretension, encoun\u00ad tering each man alive as if expecting to receive more than he could impart. And, in truth, the heart of many an ordinary man had, perchance, inscriptions which he could not read. But it was impossible to dwell in his vicinity, without inhaling, more or less, the mountain-atmosphere of his lofty thought, which, in the brains of some people, wrought a singular giddiness--new truth being as heady as new wine . \" (Haw\u00ad thorne, \"The Old Manse: The Author Makes the Reader with His Abode,\" Mosses from an Old Manse [1846], Vol. 10 Centenary Edition [1974], 30-31); (c) \"Hotel d'Europe (Avignon) June 1st, Wednesday [1859]. I I remember nothing very special to put down about Marseilles; though it was really like passing from death to life, to find ourselves in busy, cheerful, effervescing France, after living so long between asleep and awake in sluggish Italy. I I At four o'clock, we started on the railroad; Mamma and Una in the first class; the rest of us in the second. Our carriage was comfortable; and we found in it besides two other Frenchwomen, two nuns. They were very devout, and sedulously read their little books of devotion, repeated prayers under their breath, kissed the crucifixes which hung at their girdles, and told a string\u00b7 of beads, which they passed from one to the other. So much were they occupied with these duties, that they scarcely looked at the scenery along the road, though probably it is very rare for them to see anything outside of their.convent-walls. They never failed to mutter a prayer and kiss the crucifix, whenever we plunged into a tunnel. If they glanced at their fellow-passengers, it was shyly and askance, with their lips in motion all the while, like children afraid to let their eyes wander from their lesson-books. One of them, however, took occasion 54 to pull down Rosebud's dress, which, in her frisky movements about the carriage, had got a little too high for the nun's sense of decorum. Neither of them was at all pretty, nor was the black stuff dress and white muslin cap in the least becoming; neither were their features of an intelligent or high-bred stamp. Their manners, however, or such little glimpsesas I could get of them, were unexceptionable; and when I drew a curtain to proteet one of them from the sun, she made me a very courteous gesture of thanks. I We had some very good views both of sea and hills, along the road; and part of our way, I think, lay along the banks of the Rhone . By the by, at the station in Marseilles, just before we started, I bought the two volumes of the Livre des Merveilles, by a certain author of my aequaintanc~, translated into French, and printed and illustrated in very pretty style. Miss Shepard also bought them, and, in answer to her inquiry for other works by the same author, the book-woman observed that she did not think Monsieur Nataniel had published anything else. The Christian name seems to be the most important one in France, and especially in Italy. I We were four hours, and more, on our journey, and arrived at Avignon in the dusk of the evening.

Perhaps Hawthorne's oral points of style (consonant stresses) are the magic nails by means of which he builds a discourse of ascent to God--i.e., out of the heritage\u00ad tormented pit of himself; (a) MAGIC, \"white\" over \"black,\" has (b,i-v) ~l, auxiliary writings on miscellany and travel: (a) \"[MAGIC]. The art of compulsion of the supernatural; also, the art of controlling nature by supernatural means. The word derives from the Magi, Persian priests whose practices were labeled magic (mageia) by the Greeks. A definition of what is magic and what is not is difficult, for one's own beliefs are seldom if ever connected with magical practices, while those of other peoples which differ are often magic, superstition, witchcraft, etc. The relationship of magic to religion and science, indeed the very nature and definition of magic, has been the subject of much debate among students of the subject. Such men as Sir J. G. Frazer [The Goldon Bough, 1911-15], whose influence is widespread but whose theories have been criticized because of his selectivity in choosing facts from among a mass of other facts and basing his theories on them, believe magic to be a preliminary stage in the development of religion. To Frazer, magic is compulsion; religion is propitiation; a combination of the two exist side by side since neither method proves fully successful alone. Frazer subdivides sympathetic magic into homeopathic magic, which assumes that similarity between things indicates their identity, and contagious magic, which postulates that things once in contact remain in contact indefi\u00ad nitely. Homeopathic magic is exemplified by envoutement; the image is the person and sticking pins in it or the like will cause pain, illness, or death to the person the image is named for. Contagious magic uses such materials as nail parings, locks of hair, excrement, names, even footprints, of the person for similar effects; since these were once part of, or in contact with, the person, they retain his essence and what is done to them will affect the body. I Aside from theories of the nature and origin of magic and its relationship to the growth of religion, magic generally is considered to be either positive or negative. Positive magic is intended to do something; the talisman performs positive magic. Negative magic is meant to prevent something; the amulet protects by negative magic against demons, spells, witches, and 56 other workers of positive magic. A tabu that prevents some action by a erson is positive, rather than negative magic, for the breaker of the ~abu is punished by having semething done to him. Generally magic works by controlling forces or demonic beings; it is the attempted control of those forces which students believe underlies primitive science. Magic may also be either black or white. Black magic is evil, for it calls into play unsanctioned forces and beings, or it aims at illness, death, injury, or other uncountenanced effects. White magic performs cures or wonders without the invocation of dark powers; astrology, alchemy, legerdemain, the doctrine of signatures, and the like, all are classified as white magic. In folktale, the man who sells his soul to the Devil in return for the Devil's aid (compare FAUST) is a practitioner of black magic; the hero whO is given special powers by a grateful animal either is not considered a magician ar is a practitioner of white magic. \" (Leach, ed., Stand.

Like the Roman Vestals, they keep a perpetual fire in their temples, feeding it with odoriferous woods, of great value. Private individuals, when rich enough to sustain the expense, likewise keep these fires in their house, and thus transmute their wealth into the perfumed smoke which arises from the costly woods. [Carsten] Niebuhr affirms, that he saw, in one of the temples of these people, at Bombay, some fires which had been kept perpetually burning for two hundred years, and had probably been all that time supplied with odoriferous fuel. Such is their veneration for the element of fire, that they will not permit a candle to be blown out, lest the breath of man should pollute the purity of the flame. It has been remarked, that if there could possibly exist an idolatry founded on reason, and which did not degrade the Divine Majesty by the symbols of its worship, it would be that of the adorers of fire, and of the eternal lustres of the firmament. There is, in truth, nothing that can be seen or felt, which combines so many symbolic attributes of splendor, terror, and beneficence, as fire.\"; (b,ii) \"Relics of Witchcraft I The pins, which the New England witches were said to thrust into the bodies of those whom they afflicted, in 1692, are still preserved among the records of the court, in Salem.\"; (b,iii) \"Church of Saint Sophia I This edifice, of which we have given an engraving in another part of our Magazine,[] was built b.y the Emperor Theodosius.\" (Hawthorne, from The American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge [Aug.; Jul.; Aug. 1836], as rpt. by Arlin Turner, in Hawthorne as Editor: Selections from His Writings in The AmerieanMagazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge [University: Louisiana State U.

I I the Sacristan or some such official 57 . appeared, and offered to show us the church. We consented; and he led us into the transept, on the right of the high altar, and ushered us into the Sacristy, where we found two artists, copying some of Fra Angelico's pictures. These were painted on the three wooden leaves of a triptyche, and, as usual, were glorified with a great deal of gilding, 50 that they seemed to float in the brightness of a heavenly element. Solomon speaks of 'apples of gold in pictures of silver.' The pictures of Fra Angelico, and other artists of that age, are really pictures of gold; and it is wonderful to see how rich the effect, and how much delicate beauty is attained (by Fra Angelico, at least) along with it. His miniature heads appear to me much more successful than his larger ones. In a monkish point of view-,-however, the chief value of the triptyche, of which I am speaking, does not lie in Fra Angelico's oictures; for they merely serve as the frame-work of som~ reliques, ~hich are set all round the edges of the three leaves. They consist of little liits and fragments of bones, and of little packages carefully tied up in silk, tne contents of which are signified in Gothic letters, appended to each parcel. I could not possibly make out what they were. The sacred vessels of tne church are likewise kept in the sacristy I Re-entering the transept, our guide showed us the Chapel of the Strozzi family, which is accessible by a flight of steps from the floor of the church. Tne walls of this chapel are covered with frescoes by Orgagna, representing, around tne altar, the Last Judgment, and, on one of the walls, Heaven and the assembly of the Blessed, and on the other, of course, HelL I cannot speak as to the truth of representation; but, at all events, it was purgatory to look at this poor, faded rubbish.

Friday.] we found our way to the portal of San Maria dei Angeli. The exterior of this church has no pretensions to beauty or majesty, or, indeed, to architectural merit of any kind, or to any architecture whatever; for it looks like a confused pile of ruined brickwork, with a facade resembling half the inner curve of a large oven. No one would imagine that there was a church under that enormous heap of ancient rubbish. But the door admits you into a circular vestibule, once an apartment of Diocletian's baths, but now a portion of the nave of the church, and surrounded with monumental busts; and thence you pass into what was the central hall of the baths, now, with little change except of detail and ornament, transformed into the body of the church. Tnis space is so lofty, broad, and airy, that the soul forthwith swells out, and magnifies itself, for the sake of filling it. It was Michael Angelo that contrived this miracle; and I feel even more grateful to him for rescuing this noble interior from destruction, than if he had originally built it himself. In the ceiling above, you see the metal fixtures, whence the old Romans hung their lamps; and there are eight gigantic pillars of Egyptian granite, standing as they stood of yore. There is a grand simplicity about this church, more satisfactory than elaborate ornament; but tne present Pope has paved and adorned one of the large chapels of the transept, in very beautiful style; and the 58 pavement of the central part is likewise beautifully laid in marbles. In the choir, there are several pictures, one of which was veiled, as celebrated pictures frequently are, in churches. A person, who seemed to be at his devotions, withdrew the veil for us, and we saw the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, by Domenichino, originally, I believe, painted in fresco at Sai~t Peter's, but since transferred to canvas, and removed hitherto. Its place at St. Peter's is supplied by a mosaic copy. I was a good deal impressed by this picture--the dying saint, amid the sorrow of those who loved him, and the fury of his eneill.ias, looking upward, where a company of angels, and Jesus in the midst, were waiting to welcome him and crown him;--and I felt what an influence pictures might have upon the devotional part of our nature. The nail\u00ad marks in the hands and feet of Jesus, ineffaceable even after he had passed into bliss and glory, touehed my heart with a sens,e of his love for us. I think this really a great picture. We walked round the church, looking at the other pictures and frescoes .. there is a statue of Saint Bruno, by Houdon . Houdon wa:s the sculptor of the first statue of Washington., and the bust whence, I suppose, all subsequent statues have been, and will be, mainly modelled. I After emerging from the church, I looked back with wonder at the stack of shapeless old brickwork that hid the splendid interior of this church. I must go there again, and breathe in that noble space.\" (Hawthorne, The French and Italian Notebooks, Vol. 14 of The Centenary Edition [1980], 3-55, 358-59 and 89-90).

I mounted high into the tree, and ate grapes there, while the vine wreathed still higher into the depths of the tree, above my head.

I The antique fashion [\"N--n- --n\"] Prefaces recognized genial the 'Gentle Reader,' 'Indulgent,' or, at coldest, the 'Honoured Reader,' to whom the prim old author was wont to make his preliminary explanations and apologies, with the 59 rtainty that they would be favourably received. I never personally c:countered, nor corresponded through the Post, with this Representative :ssence of all delightful and desirable qualities which a Reader can assess. But, fortunately for myself, I never therefore concluded him ~0 be merely a mythic character. I had always a sturdy faith in his actual existence, and wrote for him, year after year, during which the great Eye of the Public (as well it might) almost utterly overlooked my small productions. I Unquestionably, this Gentle, Kind, Benevolent, Indulgent, and most Beloved and Honoured Reader, did once exist for me, and (in spite of the infinite chances against a letter's reaching its destination, without a definite address) duly received the scrolls which I flung upon whatever wind was blowing, in the faith that they\u00b7 would find him out. But, is he extant now? In these many years, since he last heard from me, may he not have deemed his earthly task accomplished, and have withdrawn to the Paradise of Gentle Readers, wherever it may be, to the enjoyments of which his kindly charity, on my behalf, must surely have entitled him? I have a sad foreboding that this may be the truth. The Gentle Reader, in the case of any individual author, is apt to be extremely short-lived; he seldom outlasts a literary fashion, and, except in very rare instances, closes his weary eyes before the writer has half done with him. If I find him at all, it will probably be under some mossy grave-stone, inscribed with a half-obliterated name, which I shall never recognize. I I Italy, as the site of his Romance, was chiefly valuable to him as affording a sort of poetic or fairy precinct, where actualities would not be so terribly insisted upon, as they are, and must needs be, in America.

Rhetoric deals primarily with practical effectiveness. poetic with beauty. I I The essential distinction between the forms of discourse is to be found in the intention of the creator of discourse at the moment of composition and delivery; this shapes his product, and is reflected in differing types of receptor response. Whereas the creator of poetic discourse is concerned primarily with portraying life, the creator of rhetorical discourse is concerned primarily with influencing it. The end that the creator of poetic discourse seeks to achieve is the stimulation of the receptor's spirit and imagination. He endeavors to entertain, divert, quicken, enthrall. The end that the creator of rhetorical discourse seeks to achieve with his audience is belief or action. He endeavors to instruct, impress, persuade, or convince. I This difference has profound significance for both the poet and the orator. The requirement of action or acquiescence shapes the mold and limits the scope of oratory. The liberation from the claims of a single. immediate audience together with the lack of urgency involved in his message may free the poet from the handicaps of the orator and permit him to develop less parochial themes.

Hawthorne [on Raphael] in sect. 1 of my text, Hawthorne in my notes lO[c,d]--and the fusion of rhetoric and poetic in Hawthorne's orality); (b,v) \"FORM. The character of an object as experienced, or the structure into which the elements of an experience or a thing are organized (G. Gestalt; cf. 'Gestalt psychology'). The concept of form, or obvious analogues, is older than the earliest documents of critical theory, and occurs in the East as generally as in the West, esp. in speculation about the process of creation (par excellence, creation of the world by God or gods), in which the mental notion or image of a thing-to-be-produced is regarded as the form or formal principle of that thing. (W. F. Albright, From [S]tone [A]ge to Christianity, 1940, p. 130): 'a precursor of the Indo\u00ad Iranian arta and even of the Platonic idea is found in the Sumerian ~ish-ghar:-the outline, plan or pattern of things-which-are-to-be, designed by the gods at the creation of the world and fixed in heaven in order to determine the immutability of their creation.') Plato so conceived the forms or ideas of all things, even trivial human art[i]facts, to have an eternal and absolute pre-existence apart from the accident of their mundane production, which was thus an imitation, more or less f~eble, of their being (Rep. X). For Aristotle (Met. 1032bl) the human m~d is the immediate source of the forms or characters which we perceive in works of human art; but since the mind derived forms from the external reality it experiences, the form of a work of art may 'imitate' that of some objective reality. Modern use of the word form in analysis or 61 description of works of art is in part a survival of long established Platonic and esp. Aristotelian terminology, in part an instance of a natural tendency, illustrated by that terminology, to refer to the character or structure of a thing or an experience as its shape or form. 1 I [ But also:] Form and Style. Style is a given way, or manner, or fashion, of doing any thing, of going through any process; the concept of style cannot in practice be dissociated from that of some ]!ocess. This is sufficient to distinguish it from the concept of form, since as we have seen form is a concept relev~nt only to objects as such, to things and not to processes [!].But what is a formal element in an object from the point of view of analysis of the constitution of that object may be an element of style from the point of view of analysis of a process in which the object is involved. Some formal elements in things are indeed simply suggestions of process. These may be, like the brushwork in a painting, themselves vestiges of the process that produced the thing; or they may, like the eccentricities of a pianist, be incidents in a process concomitant with and necessary to our apprehension of the thing. A Gothic arch has a form, and a Romanesque arch has a different form. If we think of both as performing the common function of arching a space, the difference between them, without ceasing to be a formal difference in the things, becomes the difference between two ways or styles of executing.a process. So in all consideration of style there is-something variable and individual, the way of doing the thing, the style. To find a style in a literary work is impossible unless we conceive that som~thing is being done in the work or with it, that it is not just an object but an element in or embodiment of a process; and is impossible unless we conceive that the thing done might be done or have been done otherwise, in some other way or style. But once we do conceive a process, and set the work within it, then formal elements become 'stylistic' elements. In short, what is form in the object conceived as such is style in the process in which the object is conceived as being involved. Since it is harder to set poetry within process than prose, and less relevant to consider (even only theoretically) alternative executions of any process we associate with a poem, on the whole we use the word style.rather than prose than of poetry. [And also:] I The word 'form' applies directly in the visual, the plastic, arts. The physical elements of a book, its format, while they should be accordant, have the relationship to the work only of an external harmony. [See esp. my note 14(c,iii) for Hawthorne's inclusion of the idea of format-\u00ad as an aspect of himself as a botany.] 'Form' has been used as equivalent to 'genre,' or 'kind'; as the epic, the dramatic, form. Instead of the genus, it may refer to a species, as the farce, the sonnet. In still further specializa~ion, it may indicate a particular framework or patterned structure of a work, such as the 'merry-go-round' form of Schnitzler's Reigen, or the 'hour-glass' form (Anatole France, Thais; Henry James,The Ambassadors): two lives crossing as one moves towards fulfillment and the other towards defeat. [Cf. R. H. Pearce's apprehen\u00ad sion of the structure of Fanshawe--in my note 14(a).] Of such formal patterns and devices, several types may be distinguished: (1) syllogistic progression; idea or situation A leads to B; (2) qualitative progression, 62 b association or development of moods; (3) repetitive devices: the most o~vious, rhyme; the subplot in the drama; the return of one principle der other guises; (4) conventional form: any form developed as an unercise, or for itself, as when one sets out to write a sonnet; (5) ~cidental forms, embodied in larger works, ~. figures: some of these (climax, change of meter) can be adapted to many moods and intentions; others (hyperbole; 0. Henry ending) are more limited in their scope.\" (Shipley, ed., Diet. of World \"[STRUCTURE]. The sum of the elements that make up a work.

Rhyme too can be heuristic; it can help directly in the birth and growth of a poem. I The poet's decision to follow a set rhyme scheme or even to rhyme in some irregular fashion, limits his choice of words. Such a limitation may, of course, be maddening and may result in complete frustration or in shoddy verse. I On the other hand, aside from the requirements of meaning, this limitation frees the mind from the near-infinity of vocabulary and allows the poem to proceed. Ideally a rhyme sets the imagination (and free association) to work until the poem comes up with an image or turn of thought that fits the sense as well as the sound. A rhyme may even bring an image or idea that will suggest a new line of development. At its best, rhyme leads the poet into discoveries.

I As the word itself ~adicates, divination is the act of determining the will of the gods, ~ in several of its forms approaches animistic belief, e.g. the gods 8 the spirits of the dead, the soul of the sleeper in the land of the :ead etc. Oneiromancy, divination by dreams, presupposes basically the ;oul's communion with the knowing spirits. Shamanism or other types of possessive divination rely for their effect on the voice of the god or spirit speaking through the human medium. In more direct fashion, necromancy is the conversing of a person in full possession of his conscious faculties (the dreamer is unconscious, the shaman is deliri\u00ad ously or otherwise possessed) with the spirits of the dead. Augury depends on the widely held belief that birds and animals are closer to the gods than human beings or that they incorporate the departed spirits. Ordeals, lot-casting, and other means of divination are based on the assumption that the gods interfere with the actions of people or objects as indicators of their good or ill will. I The oracle at Delphi, traditionally the great classical oracle, must originally have been a place of augury, connected with serpent-divination. Even when the method changed, and the possessed or intoxicated priestess of Apollo uttered her cryptic phrases, the name of Pythoness was kept. There are, thus, certain places suitable for divination, potent regardless of the means used. High places are such in early Semitic belief, and so are sacred groves and springs. The time of day (e.g. midnight, the break of dawn) or the season of the year (e.g. the solstices) is often important: Halloween and Christmas, times when the spirits have returned- to earth, are such days I .... \" (George M.

Fields, in Hawthorne [1876], pp. 117-18); (c,iv) \"[PSYCHOANALYSIS OF 'THE URGE TO SPEAK':] I It is clear that the oral process [i.e., oral symbolism 'when depression changes into mania'] is struggling against the external danger which originates from the aggressive strivings directed against the environment. Since in mania the aggression is acted out and this tendency expressed itself also in eating, the result is that the eating disturbance disappears. In the mental sphere the same development is revealed through 'object-hunger.' Frequently this 'object~hunger' is mistakenly conceived of as a sign of &enital sexuality, whereas in reality it is the expression of a mixture of pregenital and aggressive strivings. I The manic mechanism begins in two different places: in the urethra through the ejection, and in the mouth through the introjection. The functioning of these two processes is combined; on the one hand mania prevents a further decline in psychotic states, and on the other hand it strives for restitution. Depending on whether the outer or the inner danger situation must be warded off, both parts of the manic mechanism alternate in appearing in the foreground. I Returning now to the questions previously left over regarding the intensity of the pleasure, the assimilation of aggression, and the cause of the urge to speak. We can answer these questions as follows. The increase of pleasure develops from the 65 displacement of urethral components to the oral zone. The assimilation f the aggression occurs in one way through the oleasurable incorporation ~d in another way through the pleasurable ejection. The urge to speak occurs because the aforementioned process has been displaced from the body to the speech. The word is treated like an object: the taking of the word into the mouth has the meaning of introjection; uttering it signifies the ejection. The urge to speak can be explained by the pressure from two sides: from the oral as well as from the urethral sources. The entire process, which presupposes the easy displacement of energy, occurs under the dominance of the primary process. I This attempt at restitution in mania differs from those attempts at restitution which result in delusion formation. The difference lies in the fact that mania, through the aid of the pleasure principle, the reality principle again becomes dominant; this change is demonstrated best in speech, but also in the patient's changed actions.

A fifth recurrent signature, \"A Pedestrian,\" has been collected in connection with individual tales in the bibliographical sections of The Centenary Edition (Vol. 10--580; Vol. 11--432); as an aspect of Hawthorne's private symbol, that motor-identity but serves to give depth to the idea \"Oberon\" --i.e., as 'over-runner' of poetic landscapes. [See notes 12 and 13[d, iv].) --On the tradition and function of pseudonyms, Annie R. Marble has commented as follows (in Pen Names and Personalities [New York and London: Appleton, 1930], p. 221): \"Frequently an author, especially among the novelists, will first address the public under an assumed name, to test his or her ability or quality of response on the part of the readers. When recognition has come, the mask is often dropped. John Galsworthy is an example of this class. In making a bibliography of his writings in fiction, one finds the first three of his books appeared by 'John Sinjohn'--Jocelyn (1898), Villa Rubein and A Man of Devon (1901). Three years later he revealed his identity in one of the first distinctive novels of a social ironist, The Island Pharisees. Hawthorne used 'Oberon' and 'Ashley A. Royce' for some of his writings in 'The Token.' I D. H. Lawrence transferred the letters of his name and called himself 'Lawrence H. Dawson.' The Journal of Arthur Stirling gave Upton Sinclair his earlier pen name. More recently Jeffrey Eardley Marston has chosen to write 'Jeffrey E. Jeffrey,' as the author of his post-war novels, The Breaking Point and The Longest Shadow. \" CHAPTER II. THE TOOL: AN ORAL-GESTURAL SCALE OF HAWTHORNE'S CONSONANT-SIGNATURES. \"Dear whe..\"l they paused to take breath, \"now that you know my name, will you not tell me how I am to reach the garden of the Hesperides?\" 1 .--A Wonder Book, p. 96. A. Introduction: The Needed Tool and Its Development. The study has indicated (in the conclusion of the preliminary development of the thesis, Chapter I) that a mediatory application of spec\u00b7ific aspects of Richard Paget's theory of consonant sound~ to . 2 Hawthorne's auxiliary text of actual literary signatures, would serve to facilitate the construction of an ideal consonant tool. By means of that tool, the power, or the petitional qualities, of Hawthorne's private discourse on name could be systematically assessed in his literary works. To be applied, after an introductory quotation in full of an adapted linguistic source-text3 (in Section B.l. The Chanting Scale of Literary Signatures), are three categorical aspects of Paget's theory of consonant sounds. Those three categorical aspects of consonant theory may be identified as follows: (a) Paget's mouth-hierarchy of commentary on the articulation of consonant sounds, as declared and followed by him in \"a brief resume of [consonant] symbolism,\" in Human Speech; (b) 66 67 Paget's designations of mouth-positions and organs-applied for the articulation of consonant sounds, as given by him in the same resume and in supplementary commentary; and (c) Paget's formulations of primitive- universal, gestural meanings for the consonant sounds, also as given by him in the same resume and in supplementary commentary. Applied to a consonant-process arrangement of Hawthorne's text of signatures, Paget's mouth-hierarchy of commentary will serve to reinforce the idea of oral hierarchy as a probable quality of Hawthorne's petition--a quality assumed by Hawthorne's signature-voice as a mouth-defined projection of the living, coordinated self. Applied to a subordinate-fragment rearrangement of Hawthorne's text of signatures, Paget's designations of mouth-positions and organs-applied will serve to reinforce the idea of an oral super-temperance of self as a probable quality of Hawthorne's petition--a quality projected by Hawthorne's signature-voice as an ideal, hierarchy-respecting series of eggressor-signatures, or interlock- ing consonant-figures. And, applied to a religious-purposive stance- paraphrase of Hawthorne's text of signatures, Paget's formulations of primitive-universal, gestural meanings for the consonant sounds will serve to reinforce the idea of a deep-visceral, or vegetal, economy of . elastic self-accommodation to.world as a probable quality of Hawthorne's by Hawthorne's signature-voice as an figure-correlative sequence of mouth-expressive remarks, 4 or oral-extensor tags. (Passages from auxiliary texts by Hawthorne will be cited, to reflect upon each of the three stages of scale construction.5) The construct brought forward in the application, a 68 five-step scale of consonant-figures with correlative \"oral-gestural\" oral-tags, will be construed: specifically, as a score for the secret hymning of the providential nominal imperative, \"Natal Gift, God's Yell: Heave to Fruit-full Shape, Tree of Thorns!\"; and, generally, as a private, implicit, integral princ.iple for evolving literary voice-form, both under sub-vocal, oral, constraint and under doom of a creative-compulsive mind-set. The construct brought forward in the mediatory application of Paget's oral-gestural linguistic, the five-step, message-chanting scale of consonant-figures with oral-tags--that idiosyncratic oral construct will be tried and found to hold, in a preliminary integrative application (in Section B.2. A Literary Proofmark of Signature-Life; and in Section . of Signature-Life, Continued) to Hawthorne's \"revolution[ary]\" adaptations for children of Classical mythology, world biography, and American history (frame story).6 Included among those auxiliary-literary texts of that preliminary integrative application will be a pseudonymous informal botanical essay, a piece not as yet attributed to Hawthorne, but one showing concordant signature features, identifiable by means of the scale. 7 The maturing oral botany which the scale will serve to channel in the preliminary application will be interpreted both as a suggestive index and aid to reader maturation (or as a symbolic hedge-cradle and goad, or normative symbol) and as a reflexively everlasting remark of approval given to the reader, for his author-encouraging growth (i.e., in the capacity to appreciate the implicit-poetic and possible-existential qualities of language, liter-69 ature, and life--perhaps even as a potential, much-bearing heir to the tradition of literature-building as world-building). Or, in terms of five levels of textual mobility (see again the conclusion of Chapter I), that oral botany maturing to scale will serve to demonstrate the power of the scale of consonant-figures to orient and to attune the reader: (2;3.a-c.i) to the immortal, literary effulgence of Hawthorne's actual name (as the author's special remark of victory over his own, oral-based self-development through minor literary forms); (2;3.a-c.ii) to the vital import of the reader's creative-linguistic presence, at the mercurial oral-root of his enigmatic texts (as a living American speaker with the \"Ha!\" wit of many tongues and social tongue-styles); (2;3.a-c. iii) to the probability of the reader's herculean triumph, over his hazardous and thorny motor-challenges (with age-sufficient appreciation of the \"lingual\" prowess and rich hymeneal suggestivity of those challenges); (2;3.a-b.iv) to the possibility of many readers' consounding with him, as America's sovereign and \"singular\" master of gesturing gardens (with mutual reinforcement of a sense of shared blessings, through befitting praise, criticism, and commercial reward); and (2;3.a-c.v) to his hope of all our exalted, concordant salvation in time, in Christ as implicit Healing 1-lord (possibly even through the literature-bonded author's rebounding petition for an unmerited higher, an impossible future recognition, or rebirth). The integral petition or message of the scale of consonant-figures, \"Literary rites as rights of passage!,\" will be formulated in a summary assessment of the scale constructed (Part C. Conclusion); the assessment will lead to the 70 statement of a set of principles, to guide the systematic application of the constructed tool to the literary works of Nathaniel Hawthorne. B. Development: The Construction of the Tool. B.l. Construction: The Chanting Scale of Literary Signatures. The study has indicated in the introduction to the present chapter (above) that a quotation in full of an adapted linguistic source-text would precede the application of specific aspects of Paget's theory of consonant sounds. That adapted linguistic source-text--basically Paget's resume of consonant symbolism (with supplementary commentary in brackets) --is presented below, headed by a schematic figure (II.B.l.Figure) also adapted from Paget's study. That adapted schematic figure--a figure of the mouth in section to indicate both the organs of speech and the \"approximate positions of the total or partial closure made by the tongue and lips\" in\u00b7the articulation of specific consonant sounds (Paget, pp. 35, 136)--may be studied first and referred to later, in the course of reading the adapted resume (and thereafter). Paget's resume of consonant symbolism (with supplementary commentary) and figure, adapted, reads as follows (single quotation marks inside brackets serve to mark wording by Paget): Hard Palate F v 71 Vocal Cords (pt. Larynx) (w. Glottis) II.8.1.Figure.

I Full closure commonly denote closing[,] containing[,] or gripplng actions--i.e. the act of closing the [two] lips.

I [Thej m seems to imply a continued closure--which is to be expected, since it is only by allowing the air stream [i.e., from the 'lungs,' 'larynx,' and 'pharynx'] to pass through the nose that the lips can be kept closed, and this form of closure inevitably produces the cons~nant ~\u00b7 [The usual 'nasal' (minion) I~(~); Front I Middle I Back,' requires the lowering or 'drawing forward of the soft palate' at the back of the upper part of the mouth.] u, iw, i, y_.

'Front.

It seems probable that in primitive speech the tongue was in fact protruded at times, as it still occasionally is among children. Thus, lubh, love, appears to be a phallic tongue gesture of which the-receptive counterpart was ka or kam--also meaning love.

But, Paget's \"answer\" te such criticism \"would be that tha subconscious mind of man is knc\";;.T. to be essentially fanciful--as witness the symbolism of dreams.\" In fact, \"[t]he truth appears to be tha~ for flights of Fancy we are all born fully fledged; but most of us moult early, and our first gay plumage is not removed\"-- and \"[t]hose who do not moult are plucked before their education is completed.\" Taking strength from Paget's final defensive turn to the poetic mind-set--\"[t]he few who escape either fate are known as Poets\"-- the present study makes application of his theory of consonant gestures to the signatures of Hawthorne as follows. B.l.a. The Chanting Scale: The Quality of Hierarchy. Hawthorne's text of actual literary signatures may be arranged to reflect the idea of air-, voice-, mind-, speech-flow through oral strictures-locations, on the basis of first-occurring consonants within surnames. A direct, hierarchy-respecting reversal of Paget's order of commentary on the articulation of consonant sounds, the back-to-front order or signatures will be the preferred order in the discussions to follow--signalling, as it does, the origin of \"expression\" in actual name, the implicit unfolding of (Hawthorne's) narration from that expressive origi~ and a petitional purposiveness, or reach, beyond the self-here-now. The relationship of the front-to-hack (ingressive, 75 Paget-mirroring*) arrangement of Hawthorne's text of signatures to the back-to-front (eggressive, preferred) arrangement may be stated as follows (the underscoring serves to mark first-occurring consonants within surnames, or within single form): * iv) Oberon [=-wb-] iii~ M. Theodore de 1 'A~~epine ii) Rev. Ashley Allen ~yce i) Nathaniel Hawthorne i) Nathaniel Hawthorne ii) Rev. Ashley Allen ~yce iii) M. Theodore de l'A~~epine iv) Oberon Paget's order of commentary serves (nevertheless) to reinforce the idea of oral hierarchy as a probable quality of Hawthorne's ~etition--a quality assumed by Hawthorne's signature-voice as a mouth-defined projection of the living, coordinated self. The relationship of the eggressive (or projective) preferred arrangement of Hawthorne's text of signatures to Paget's levels of consonant-signs(*), with their corre- spending mouth-locations of formation (including organs applied; **), may be stated as follows (single quotation marks serve to set off a few of the 'cross-locational implications' of the end] Ashley -\u00ad Allen Roy~e L I r ....

An ingressive (and recollective) scaling suggests itself, in association with society and landscape, in the first passage; an eggressive (and futuristic} scaling suggests itself, in association with society and landscape, in the second passage. The two passages read as follows (the underscoring of literal fragments and words serves to remark upon scale terminals and analogues of mouth structure): Pass. one--ingressive landscape) We S\u00a3ent \u00a3leasant day, turning o~er ~oaks, and ~eri\u00ad odicals, or talking, on the lawn, whence we could behold scenes picturesque afar, and rich vineyard glimpses, near at hand. Mr. Story is the most variously-accomplished-and brilliant person--the fullest of social life and fire--whom I have ever met; and without seeming to make any effort, he kept us amused and entertained, the whole day long; not wearisomely entertained neither, as we should have been if he had not let his fountain play naturally. Still, thougQ he bubbled and brimmed over with fun, he left the impression on me that he is not a happy man; there must surely be a morbid 77 sensibility; a pain and care, bred it may be, out of the very richness of his gifts and abundance of his outward prosperity. Rich, in the prime of life, with a wife whom he loves, and children budding and blossoming as fairly as his heart could wish; with sparkling talents, so many, that if he choose to neglect or fling away one, or two, or three, he would still have enough left to shine with;--who should be happy, if not he? Towards sunset, we all walked out into the Podere, pausing, a little while, to look down into a well, that stands on the verge of the lawn. Within the spacious circle of its stone curb was an abundant growth of maiden-hair, forming a perfect wreath of thickly clustering leaves quite round, and trailing its tendrils downward to the water which gleamed beneath. It was a very pretty sight. Mr. Story bent over the well, and uttered deep, musical tones, which were reverberated from the hollow depths with wonderful effect, as if a spirit dwelt within there, and (unlike the spirits that-speak throu~ mediums) sent him back responses profounder and more melodious than the tones that awakened them. Such a responsive well as this mi~t have been taken for oracle, in old days. (Hawthorne, The French and Italian Notebooks [Siena, Oct. 4, 1858]; Hotel June 6th Monday. I We are still here; and our life has offered few or no journalizable incidents; ncr, to say the truth, am I much inclined to record the, were they ever so interesti~. I have been daily to the Rocher des Doms, and ~ve been familiar with the old church on its declivity. I think I mi~t become attached to it by seei~ it so often; a sombre old interior, with its heavy arches, and its roof vaulted like the top of a trunk; its stone gallery, with ponderous adornments, runn~ round three sides. I observe that it is a daily custom of the old women to say their prayers in concert, sometimes making a pilgrimage, as it were, from chapel to chapel. The voice of one of them is heard running through the series of petitions, and at intervals, the voices of the others join and swell into a chorus; so that it is like a river, connecting a series of lakes; or, not to use so gigantic a simile, the one voice is like a thread, on which the beads of a rosary are strung. One day, two priests came and sat down beside these prayerful women, and, I think, joined in their petitions. I am inclined to hope that there is something genuine in the devotion of these old women. The view from the to.P. of the Rocher des Doms (Doms [ ital.], a of is truly magnificent; a ~ast mountain girdled .P.lain, illuminated ~ the far windings and reaches of the Rhone.

Hawthorne's eggressive text of signatures may be at\u00b7 once more finely and more economically scaled if attention is given to the architectony of the original name--i.e., to subordinative similarities and contrasts between initial and terminal, between extreme and medial, and between medial and medial oral-consonantal qualities prime stress--a relevant, oral-motor, On the basis repo- or internally rhymed or retempered, eggressive lexically, privately suggestive of the idea of arousal and quelling of a priest-like but passional self), Hawthorne's signature-voice may be projected as an ideal, hierarchy-respecting series of five contradictory but interlocking consonant-figures (contradictory and interlocking in terms of oral locations).

The idea of a universally tempering scale occurs in the first passage; the idea of an inherent yet damaged voice occurs in the second passage; the idea of an-at once reverent and irreverent extension of name occurs in the third passage; the idea of a universe with an implicit, constrain- ing serpent at its center (split-tongue within sweet over-flow) occurs in the fourth passage; and the idea of a multilingual flight of words to enliven name occurs in the fifth passage. The series of passages reads as follows (the underscoring of fragments and words serves to remark upon a few features of scale-stepping, with eye-and ear-patterns of figures taken into account): 84 Pass. one--tempering scale) If cities were built to the sound of music [i], then some edifices would appear to be constructed by ~raV: [ii], solemn tones,--others to CE, VIII [1972], 183) Pass. two--damaged voice) There is a woman who has several times passed through this !!anover Street, in whi\u00a3h [ii] we live, stopping occasionally to sing songs under the windows; and last evening, between nine and ten o'clock, she came and sang Kathleen 0 'Moore richly and sweetly. Rer voice rose up out of the dim, chill street, and made our hearts throb in unison with it as we sat in our comfortable drawing-room. I never heard a voice that touched me more deeply. Somebody told her to go away, and she stopped like a nightingale suddenly shot; but, finding that S[ophia] wished to know something about her, Fanny and one of the maids ran after her, and brought her into the hall. It seems she was educated to sing at the opera, and married an Italian opera\u00ad singer, who is now dead; l~dging in a model lodging-house at threepence a night, and being a penny short to-night, she tried this method, in hope of getting this penny. She takes in plain sewing when she can get any, and picks up a trifle about the street by means of her voice, which, she says, was once sweet, but has now been injured by the poorness of her living. She is a pale woman, with black eyes, Fanny says, and may have been pretty once, but is not so now. It seems strange, that with such a gift of Heaven, so cultivated, too, as her voice is, making even an unsusceptible heart vibrate like a harp string, she should not have had an engagement among the hundred theatres and singing-rooms of London; that she should throw away her melody in the streets for the mere chance of a penny, when sounds not a hundredth part so sweet are worth from other=lips p~rses-of gold [v]~ - - - name) [October 5 (1855).]--It rained almost all day on Wednesday, so that I did not go out till late in the afternoon, and then on!_y !:OO~ a !troll along Oxford Street and Holborn [iii], and back through Fleet Street and=the-Strand: Yesterday, at a little after ten, I went to the ambassador's to get my wife's passport for Lisbon. 85 I next went to Westminster Abbey, where I had long promised myself another quiet visit; for I think I never could be weary of it; and when I finally leave England, it will be this spot which I shall feel most unwilling to quit forever. I found a party going through the seven chapels (or whatever their number may be), and again saw those stately and quaint old tombs,--ladies and knights stretched out on marble slabs, or beneath arches and canopies of stone, let into the walls of the Abbey, reclining on their elbows, in ruff and farthingale or rivet:ed armor, or i..\"l robes of state, .. once painted in rich colors, or which only a few patches of ~\u00a3arlet now remain; bearded faces of noble knights, whose noses, in many-- cases, had been smitten off; and Mary Queen of Scots baa lost two fingers of her beautiful hands, which she is clasping in prayer. There must formerly have been very free access to these tombs; for I observed that all the statues (so far as I examined' them) were scratched with the initials of visitors, some of the names being dated above a century ago. The old coronation-chair, too, is quite covered, over the back and seat, with initials cut into it with pocket knives, just as Yankees would do it; only it is not whittled away, as would have beenrits fate in our hands. Edward the Confes\u00ad sor's shrine, which is chiefly of wood, likewise abounds in these inscriptions, although this was esteemed the holiest shrine in England, so that pilgrims still come to kneel and kiss it. Our guide, a rubicund verger of cheerful demeanor, said that th!s was true in a\u00b7few instances. (Hawthorne, Pass. four--serpent center) English Note-Books [London, Oct. 1855], RE, VIII, 159-60) Last evening, my wife, Una, and I, went over to the Powers' and sat with themon their terrace, at the top of the house, till nearly 10 [o']clock. It was a delightful, calm, summer evening, and we were elevated high above the adjacent roofs, and had a prospect of the greater part of Florence and its towers, and the surrounding hills; while right beneath us rose the trees of a garden, and hardly sent their tops higher than we sat. At a little distance, with only a house or two between, was a theatre in full act; Theatro Goldoni, which is an open amphitheatre, in the ancient fashion, without any roof or other covering on top. We could see the upper part of the proscenium, and, had we been a little nearer, might have seen the whole performance, as did several boys and other rogues who crept along the roofs of the adjacent houses. As it was we heard the music and the applause, and now and then an actor's . stentorian tones, when we chose to listen. The female Powers, and : my wife and Una, and Master Bob, sat in a group together and chatted, in one corner of our aerial drawing-room; while Mr. Powers 86 and myself leaned against the parapet~ and talked of ~p~e o~ the sweetness of the Florence bells, the tones of some of which are = -=----= = = - - = = [iv] on being upturned. I had supposed, in my lack of ~sical ear, that the bells of the Campanile were the sweetest; but Mr. Powers says that there is a defect in their tone~ and that the bell of the Palazzo Vecchio is the most melodious he ever heard. Then he spoke of his havirig been a manufacturer of organs, or, at least, of reeds for organs, at one period of his life. I wonder what he has not been! He told me of an invention of his, in the musical line; a jewsharp with two tongues; and by and by he produced it for my inspection. It was carefully kept in a little wooden case, and was very neatly and elaborately constructed, with screws to tighten it2 and a silver centre-piece between the two tongues. Evidently a great deal of thought had been bestowed on this little harp; but the inventor told me that it was an utter failure, because the tongues were apt to interfere and jar with one another; although the strain of music was very sweet and melodious (as he proved, by playing on it a little) when everything went right. It was a youthful production; and he said that its failure had been a great disappointment to h:im at the time; whereupon I congratulated h:im that his faiiures had been in small matters, and his successes in great ones. We talked, furthermore, about instinct and reason, and whether the brute creation\u00b7have souls, and, if they have none, how justice is to be d~ne them for their sufferings here; and came finally to the conclusion (at least, Mr. Powers did) that brutes suffer only in appearance, and that God enjoys for them all that they seem to enjoy, and that man is the only intelligent and sentient being, except his Creator . We reasoned high about other states of being; and I suggested the possibility that there might be beings inhabiting this earth, contemporaneously witfi\u00b7us, and close beside us, but of whose existence and whereabout we could have no perception, nor they of ours, because we are endowed with different sets of senses; for certainly it was within God's power to create beings who should communicate with nature by innumerable other senses than these few which we possess. Mr. Powers gave hospitable reception to this idea, and said that it had occurred to himself; and he has evidently thought much and earnestly about such matters, but is rather too apt, in my opinion, to let his ideas crystallize into a theory, before he can have sufficient data for it. He is a Swedenborgian in faith. The moon had risen behind the trees, while we were talking; and Powers intimated his idea that beings analogous to men--men in everything except the modifications necessary to adapt them to their physical circumstances--inhabited the planets, and peopled them with beautiful shapes. Each planet, however, must, have its own standard of the beautiful, I suppose; and probably his sculptor's eye would not see much to admire in the proportions of an inhabitant of Saturn. 87 The atmosphere of Florence (at least, when we ascend a little way into it) seems to suggest planetary speculations. Galilee found it so; and Mr. Powers and I pervaded the whole Universe, but finally crept down his garret-stairs, and parted, with a friendly pressure of the hand. (Hawthorne, The French and Italian Notebooks [Florence, July 28, 1858]; CE, XIV The little Frenchman ['Monsieur Schaeffer'] impresses me very - = = = =-= - strQ~ly, t\u00a3\u00a3--S~ of his ~tiog [v];--making his home from darkness to daylight, and enjoying here what little domestic comfort and confidence there is for him; and then going about all the live-long day, teaching French to blockheads who sneer at him; and returning at about ten o'clock in the evening (for I was wrong in saying he supped here--he eats no supper) to his solitary room and bed. Before retiring, he goes to Bridge's bedside, and, if he finds him awake, stands talking French, expressing his dislike of the Americans--\"Je hais--Je hais les Yankees!\"--thus giving vent to the stifledbitterneSs of the whole day. In the morning, I hear him getting up early--at sunrise or before--humming to himself, scuffling about his chamber with his thick boots, and at last taking his departure for a solitary ramble till breakfast. Then he comes in cheerful and vivacious enough, eats pretty heartily, and is off again, singing a French chanson as he goes down the gravel-walk. The poor fellow has nobody to sympathize with him but Bridge; and thus a singular connection is established between two utterly dtfferent characters. Then here is myself, who am likewise a queer ckaracter in my way, and have come here to spend a week or two with my friend of a half-a life-ttme;--the longest space, probably, that we are ever destined to. spend together; for fate seems to be preparing changes for both of us. [/ Also:] Returned home, and took a lesson in French of Mr. Schaeffer. I like him very much, and have seldom met with so honest, simple, and apparently so well-principled a man; which good qualities I impute to his being, by the father's side, of German blood. He looks more like a German--or, as he says, like a Swiss--than a Frenchman, having very light hair, and a fair comp.lexion, and not a French expression. He is a vivacious little fellow, and wonderfully excitable to mirth; and it is truly a sight to see him laugh, how every feature partakes of his merriment, and even his whole body shares in it; and he rises and dances about the room. He has great variety of conversation, commensurate with his experience in life, and sometimes will talk Spanish, ore rotunda; sometimes imitate the 88 Catholic priests, chanting Latin songs for the dead, in deep, gruff, awful tones, producing really a very strong impression; then will he break out into a light French song, perhaps of love, perhaps of war, acting it out, as if on the stage of a theatre. All this intermingled with continual fun, excited by the incidents of the passing moment. He has frenchified all our names, calling Bridge Monsieur du Pont, ~ysel~ ~\u00b7 de l'A~~e2~e, and himself M. le Berger, and all knights of the round table; and we live in great harmony and brotherhood-- as crueer a life as any body leads, and as queer a set as may be found anywhere. In his more serious intervals, he talks philosophy and deism, and preaches obedience to the law of reason and morality; which law he says, (and I believe him) that he has so well observed, that, notwithstanding his residence in dissolute countries, he has never yet sinned with woman. [/ Also:] He is a very singular fellow, with an originality in all his notions--not that nobody has ever had such before, but that he has thought them out for himself. He told me, yesterday, that one of his sisters was a waiting maid in the Rocher de Cancale. He is about the sincerest fellow I ever knew--never pretends to feelings that are not in him; never flatters. His feelings do not seem to be warm, though they are kindly. He is so single-minded, that he cannot understand badinage, but takes it all as if meant in earnest--a German trait. He values himself greatly on being a Frenchman, though all his most valuable qualities come from Germany. His animal desires are none of the strongest,. but he is greatly delighted with any attention from the ladies. a short time since, a lady gave him a nosegay of roses and pinks; he capered; and danced, and sang, put the boquet in water, carried it to his own chamber, but he brought it for us to see and admire, two or three times a day; ~esto~in~ o~ it magnifigue.\" some of the flowers - ------- --= - -began to fade, he made the rest, with others, into a new b~quet, and consulted us whether it would be fit to give to another lady. Contrast \u00b7this French foppery with his solemn moods, when we sit in the twilight, or after Bridge is abed, talking of Christianity and Deism, of ways of life, of marriage, of benevolence,--in short all deep matters of this world and the next. And evening or two since, he began singing all manner of English songs--such as Mrs. Heamans \"Landing of the Pilgrims\"--Auld Lang Syne:-with some of Moore's &c-\u00ad the singing pretty fair, but in the queerest tone and accent. Occasionally, he breaks out in scraps from French tragedies, which he spouts with corresponding action. He generally gets close to me, in these displays of musical and histrionic talent.

The sequence of passages reads as follows (fragments and words in capital type serve to remark upon features of oral-extending, elastic miming of the mouth): Pass. one--manly bracing) Went with Bridge yesterday to visit several Irish shanties, endeavoring to find out who had stolen some rails of a fence.

Few of these people are connected with the Mill-Dam, or at least, many are not so; but have intruded themselves into the vacant huts which were occupied by the Mill-Dam people last year. In two or three places hereabouts there is quite a village of these dwellings, with a clay and board chimney, or oftener an old barrel smoked and charred with the fire. Some of their roofs are covered 93 with sods, and appear almost subterranean. One of the little hamlets stands on both sides of a deep dell, wooded and bush-grown, with a vista as it were into the heart of a wood in one direction and to the broad sunny river on the other; a little rivulet crossed by a plank, at the bottom of the dell. At two doors we saw very pretty and modest-looking young women; one with a child in her arms, and\u00b7 another in her belly. Indeed they all have innumerable little children; and they are invariably in good flesh, though always filthy of face.

Yet Bridge undoubtedly has this right; and it is not a little striking to see how quietly these people contem\u00ad plate the probability of his exercising it--resolving indeed, to burrow in their holes as long as may be, yet caring about as little for an ejectment, as those who could find a tenement anywhere. Yea less. Yet the women, amid all the trials of their situation, appear to have kept up the distinction between virtue and vice; those who can claim the former will not associate with the latter. When the women travel with young children, they carry the baby slung at their backs, and sleeping quietly. The dresses of the new-comers are old fashioned, making them look aged before their time.

However, we needed no fire now; and there was promise of good cheer in the spectacle of a man cleaning some lake-fish for our dinner, while the poor things flounced and wriggled under the knife. The dinner made its appearance, after a long while, and was most plentiful; a rice-soup; a large dish. of fried fish, some chops, and some chickens, besides, I think, a pudding, maccaroons, and fruit; so that, having measured our appetites in anticipation of a paucity of food, we r~d to make more room for such overflowing abundance.

Mrs. Powers told my wife a marvellous thing;--how that, when Mr. Hume was holding a seance in her house, and several persons present, a great scratching was heard in a neighboring closet. She addressed the spirit, and requested it not to disturb the company then, as they were busy with other affairs, promising to converse with it on a future occgsion. On a subsequent night, accordingly, the scratching was renewed, with the utmost violence; and in reply to Mrs. Powers's questions, the spirit assured her that it was not ~' but legion, being the ghosts of twenty seven monks, who were miserable and without hope! The house, now occupied by Powers, was formerly a convent, and I suppose these were the spirits of all the wicked monks that had ever inhabited it; --at least, I hope that there were not such a number of damnable sinners extant at any one time.

Construction: A Literary Proofmark of Signature-Life. The study has indicated in the introduction to the present chapter that the construct brought forward in the mediatory application of Richard Paget's oral-gestural linguistic---the five-step, message-chanting scale of consonant-figures with oral-tags--that idiosyncratic oral construct would be tried and found to hold in a preliminary integrative application to auxiliary-literary texts by Hawthorne. Or, the construct would be tried and found to hold in a preliminary integrative application to Hawthorne's own adaptations for children, of Classical mythology, world biography, and American history (frame story), and to a pseudonymous botanical essay showing concordant signature features. The maturing oral botany which the constructed scale would serve to channel in the preliminary application would be interpreted both as a suggestive index and aid to reader maturation (or as a symbolic hedge-cradle and goad, or normative symbol) and as a reflexively everlasting remark of approval given to the reader, for his author-encouraging growth in capacities to appreciate literature--perhaps even as a potential, much-bearing heir to 101 the tradition of literature-building as world-building. The oral botany maturing to scale would also be interpreted in terms of five levels of textual, or reader, mobility. In the present section (Section B.2), the study makes trial appli- cation of the constructed scale to Hawthorne's adaptations for children of classical mythology and world biography (to three selections from world biography, as \"immortal name\" stories). Hawthorne's prefaces to his two collections of myths and his collection of biographies contain remarks which serve to encourage the application; out of thoughts of play and name, a space-claiming tree grows, in a chronological arrangement of intentional commentary from the prefaces. The chronological arrangement of relevant prefatorial commentary reads as follows (the italics are mine): \"Preface,\" Biographical Stories, 1842) It is here attempted to give our little readers such impressions as they might have gained, had they themselves been the play-mates of persons, who have long since performed important and brilliant _parts upon the stage of life. If this be tolerably well accomplished, it is conceived that the effect must be good. Somewhat of the sympathy of childish intimacies will attach itself to these famous names of history and literature .. The author has allowed himself considerable freedom in drawing, from his own ideas, those minor details which impart life and reality to a narrative. This small volume, and others of a similar character, from the same hand, have not been composed without a deep sense of responsi\u00ad bility. The author regards children as sacred, and would not, for the world, cast anything into the fountain of a young heart, that might embitter and pollute its waters. And, even in point of the reputation to be aimed at, juvenile literature is as well worth cultivating as any other. The writer, if he suceed in pleasing his little readers, may hope to be remembered by them till their own old age--a far longer period of literary existence than is generally attained, by those who seek immortality from the judgments of full grown men. 102 \"Preface,\" A Wonder Book, 1851) The Author has \u00b7long been of opinion, that many of the classical myths were capable of being rendered into very capital reading for children. He does not plead guilty to a sacrilege, in having sometimes shaped anew, as his fancy dictated, the forms that have been hallowed by a~ antiquity of two or three thousand years. No epoch of time can claim a copyright in these immortal fables. They seem never to have been made; and certainly, so long as man exists, they can never perish; but, by their indestructibility itself, they are legitimate subjects for every age to clothe with its own garniture of manners and sentiment, and to imbue with its own morality. In the present version, they may have lost much of their classical aspect, (or, at all events, the Author has not been careful to preserve \u00b7it,) and have perhaps assumed a Gothic or romantic guise. In performing this pleasant task--for it has been really a task fit for hot weather, and one of the most agreeable, of a literary kind, which he ever undertook--the Author has not always thought it necessary to write downward, in order to meet the comprehension of children. He has generally suffered the theme to soa~, whenever such was its tendency, and when he himself was buoyant enough to follow without effort. \"The Wayside: Introductory,\" Tanglewood Tales, 1853) I doubt A Wonder Book, narrator, whom 'I parad(ed) up and down over my half-a-dozen acres'] did not internally pronounce the whole thing a bore, until I led him to my predecessor's little ruined, rustic summer-house, mid-way on the hill-side [at 'The Wayside, Concord, is a mere skeleton of slender, decaying, tree-trunks, with neither walls nor a roof; nothing but a tracery of branches and twigs, which the next wintry blast will be very likely to scatter in fragments along the terrace. It looks, and is, as evanescent as a dream; and yet, in its rustic net-work of boughs, it has somehow inclosed a hint of spiritual beauty, and has become a true emblem of the subtile and ethereal mind that planned .it. I made Eustace Bright sit down on a snow-bank, which had heaped itself over the mossy seat, and gazing through the arched-window, opposite, he acknowledged that the scene at once grew picturesque. \"Simple as it looks,\" said he, \"this little edifice seems to be the work of magic. It is full of suggestiveness, and, in its own way, is as good as a cathedral. Ah, it would be just the spot for one to sit in, of a summer-afternoon, and tell the children some more of those wild stories from the classical myths!\" 103 \"It would, indeed,\" answered I. \"The summer-house itself, so airy and so broken, is like one of those old tales, imperfectly remembered; and these living branches of the Baldwin apple-tree, thrusting themselves so rudely in, are like your unwarrantable interpolations. But by-the-by have you added any more legends to the series, since the publication of the Wonder Book?\" Eustace put his bundle of manuscript into my hands; and I skimmed it pretty rapidly, trying to find out its merits and demerits by the touch of my fingers, as a veteran story-teller ought to know how to do. [T]he connection with myself [as his 'editor'], he was kind enough to say, had been highly agreeable; nor was he by any means desirous of kicking away the ladder that had perhaps helped him to reach his present elevation. My young friend was willing, in short, that the fresh verdure of his growing reputation should spread over my straggling, and half-naked boughs; even as I have sometimes thought of training a vine, with its broad leafiness and purple fruitage, over the worm-eaten posts and rafters of the rustic summer-house. I was not insensible to the advantages of his proposal, and gladly assured him of my acceptance. Merely from the titles of the stories, I saw at once that the subjects were not less rich than those of the former volume Yet, in spite of my experience of his ['Mr. Bright's'] free way of handling them, I did not quite see, I confess, how he could have obviated all the difficulties in the way of rendering them presentable to children. These old legends, so brimming over with everything that is most abhorrent to out Christianized moral-sense--some of them so hideous--others so melancholy and miserable, amid which the Greek Tragedians sought their themes, and moulded them into the sternest forms of grief that ever the world saw;--was such material the stuff that children's playthings should be made of! How were they to be purified? How was the blessed sunshine to be thrown into them? But Eustace told me that these myths were the most singular thing in the world', and that he was invariably astonished, whenever he began to relate one, by the readiness with which it adapted itself to the childish purity of his auditors. [T]he stories (not by any strained effort of the narrator's, but in harmony with their inherent germ) transform themselves, and re-assume the shapes which they might be supposed to possess in the pure childhood of the world. I let the youthful author talk, as much and as extravagantly as he pleased, and was glad to see him commencing life with such confidence in himself and his performances. A few years will-do all that is necessary towards showing him the truth, in both respects. Meanwhile, it is but right to say, he does really appear to have overcome the moral objections against these fables; although at the expence of such liberties with their structure, as must be left to plead their own excuse, without any help from me. Indeed, except that there was a necessity for it--and that the inner life of 104 the legends cannot be come at, save by making them entirely one's own property--there is no\u00b7defence to be made. (Hawthorne, The Centenary of self-renewal, the study makes trial application of the constructed scale to all twelve of the myths and to three of the biographies as follows.

Initial letter of the word capitalized.] (Hawthorne, story in WB)9 The trial application of the constructed scale to Hawthorne's myths and biographies for children (above) does serve to channel a.maturing oral botany. That oral botany may be interpreted both as a suggestive index and aid to reader maturation (or as a symbolic hedge-cradle and goad, or normative symbol) and as a reflexively everlasting remark of approval given to the reader, for his author-encouraging growth in capacities to appreciate literature--i.e., perhaps even as a potential, much-bearing heir to the tradition of literature-building as world- building, of humanity-tempering through self-tempering. Or, in terms of five levels of reader mobility, the constructed scale serves to orient and to attune the reader: (2.a-c.i) to the immortal, literary effulgence of Hawthorne's actual name (as the author's special remark of victory over his own, oral-based self-development through minor literary forms-- 'm n seed-t[H]rone-sky'); (2.a-c.ii) to the vital import of the reader's creative-linguistic presence, at the mercurial root of his enigmatic texts (as a living .American speaker with the \"Hug-Hawl\" wit of many tongues and social tongue-styles--'KeY-sHape/diCtion-beHold'); (2.a-c.iii) to the probability of the reader's herculean triumph, over .his hazardous and thorny motor-challenges (with age-sufficient apprecia_: tion of the lingual hymeneal suggestivity of those 171 cballenges--'singLe/tree-cut-t[W]ine'); (2.a-c.iv) to the possibility of manY readers' cons.ounding with him, as America's sovereign and singular master of gesturing gardens (with mutual reinforcement of a sense of shared blessings, through befitting praise, criticism, and real-commercial reward--'[you eaSe]-Harm-crown'); and (2.a-c.v) to his hope of all our exalted, concordant salvation in time, in Christ as implicit Healing Word (possibly even through the literature-bonded author's rebounding serpent-p~tition [a.i], for an unmerited higher, an future recognition, or rebirth--'box/Hope-me/pine-Peg/Poet['s:sons':(S)]un[-Log]'). B.3. Construction: A Literary Proofmark of Signature-Life, Continued. The preliminary application of the constructed scale, to auxiliary\u00ad literary texts by Hawthorne, continues. In the present section of chapter development (Section B.3), the study undertakes a selective trial integration of Hawthorne's frame narratives for children--i.e., of his frame narratives for the two mythologies (A Wonder Book [1852] and Tanglewood Tales [1853], for the volume of world biography (Biographical Stories for Children [1842, 1851]), and for the three sequels of adaptations from American history (Grandfather's Chair [1841], Famous Old People [1841], and Liberty Tree [1841]; or, The Whole History of Grandfather's Chair [1851]). But the study undertakes that integration of frame texts chiefly to provide a conjoined frame for a piece of \"natural history\"--or for the pseudonymous . informal botanical essay which (the study has claimed) shows signature-172 features concordant with Hawthorne's texts for children. Taking strength fr011l Hawthorne's own strong awareness of \"the same from accord with a wooden-lipped lady idol (B.2.b.iii; B.l.b}. and from the qualities of self-reproach for ecstatic flights of vision within \"mortal\" rounds of the flesh (B.2.c.v; B.l.c}, the study makes application as follows--of the self-constraining, scaled jaws of Hawthorne, to sing, counterchant, and hymn, round,about his own emblematic tree (B.l, closing--feature [2.c]}. (The technical comments which precede application in Section B.2 generally apply below; but partial scales determine the division of Subsections B.3.a-b.

In this hope-in-\"Heaven\"-and-fear-\"Magnolia\" that \"The spines more than an inch long an almost impregnable barrier I spring /take[] two [J~ars to vegetate I ... blossom I never fails\"--\"home to []angle[-]wood\" ('box/Hope-melpine-PegiPoet['s: sons':(S)]un[-Log]'). Such, then, are the tried and holding powers of Life!, of the signature-voice of the children's Hawthorne, in its ongoing, oral private petition. C. Conclusion: The Scale of Consonant-Figures and the Principles of Its Application. In the foregoing, developmental part of this, the second chapter of the thesis, specific aspects of Richard Paget's theory of consonant sounds, as presented in his Human Speech, have been applied to Hawthorne's text of actual literary signatures and have served to mediate the construction of an oral-ideal tool. By means of that oral-ideal tool, a scale of consonant-figures with oral-tags, the name-constrained petitional qualities of Hawthorne's writings for children could be, and were, systematically assessed. The power of the scale, to orient and to attune the reader, to the oral self-fulfillment of Hawthorne's name 194 llithin auxiliary-literary texts with strongly traditional contexts, suggests that the constructed tool may be integrally, or universally, assessed as Hawthorne's very own self-extending charm-over-words, or as his own life-wisdom-alive book-stave, or as his and the reader's \"(Key to:) Literary rites as rights of passage!\" As universal key to literary rites of passage, the chant-scale of Hallthorne's serpent master-symbol (see again I.C and II.B.l, closing) suggests the principles \u00b7by means of which Hawthorne's works may be brought into a concordance by the reader, for purposes of assessing the higher literary qualifications of Hawthorne's signature-voice, as heart-demand for public and evident recognition and praise, for Provi\u00ad dential and real life-and-death blessings. Those key principles, to operate at each step of the consonant-scale, may be derived (from the chapter proofs--for further development) as follows: (II.B.2;3.a-c.i-\u00ad III.B.l-5.a) step-classification of works, chiefly through literal rhymes within their titles (or nam~s), as fair tallies (cf. fairy tales) of signature-voice effulgence; (II.B.2;3.a-c.ii--III.B.l-5.b) class\u00ad representative exposition of the fabling inflection of the master singing; (II.B.2;3.a-c.iii--III.B.l-5.c) class-representa\u00ad tive location of the of agent-branches setting, all-round influx of the world hymning; and (II.B.2;3.a-c.v--III.B.l-5.e) class-representative revelation of the heuristic imperative, as a mythic apotheosis over disjointed signature-195 relics.\u00b7 The assessment of the higher literary qualities of Hawthorne's discourse on his providence of poetic name would proceed out of the concordance of representative passages--passages representative at once of qualities of scale and of fiction (short, long, and unfinished) by 12 Hawthorne, intended as reading for adults. In short, the mediatory application of Paget's theory of consonant sounds to Hawthorne's auxiliary text of actual literary signatures has helped to develop a tool, by means of which the presence and the power of the name of Nathaniel Hawthorne may now be studied in Hawthorne's literary works.

[New York: DBS Publications, 1967]); --subsequent bibliogr. citations of Paget's study, source-text and other portions, occur between quotation marks or parenthetically within my text. 4 My constructive re-voicing of Hawthorne's text of signatures has been guided by a philosophy of destructive word-play not out of harmony. either with Paget's remarks on poetic fancy (quoted in my text, Part B) 196 l.97 r with serious considerations of Hawthorne's intellectual milieu {approached in my Chapter IV, suggested tn\u00b7my note 7, below); and it has been guided by specific information on graphemic, phonetic, lexical, etymologic, and cultural features of that text (author-private, standard, and associative-inferential). An authoritative voice (a) for my philosophy of word-play (with statement) and the linguistic references (b-e) for the specific information (which I estimate as commonplace in scholarship and apply without further citation of sources in the present chapter) may be listed here as follows: (a) Michel Foucault, .The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (1966), tr. Random Hse. (New York: Pantheon, 1979) (esp. statement: \"The idea that, when we destroy words, what is left is neither mere noise nor arbitrary, pure elements, but other words, which when pulverized in turn, will set free still other words--this idea, is at once the negative of all the modern sciences of language and the myth in which we now transcribe the most obscure and the most real powers of language. It is probably because it is arbitrary, and because one can define the conditions upon which it attains its power of signification, that language can become the object of a science. But it is because it has never ceased to speak withiil. itself, because it is penetrated as far as we can reach within it by ixexhaustible values, that we can speak within it in that endless murmur in which literature is born.\"--from \"Speaking,\" p. 103 [cf. my I.End Sampson, \"The 'W' ill Hawthorne's Name,.\" Essex Institute Historical Collections, Vol. 100, No. 4 (Oct. 1964), 297-99 (see again my I.End Notes.ll[b]) (with: Daniel Names\" [incl. \"Nathaniel,\" a New Testament name], New England Quarterly, Vol. 1, No. 4 [Oct. 1928], 467-.\"75; Henry Barber, British Family Names: Their Origin and Meaning [London: Elliot Stock, 1894]; Frederick G.

The appeal to revolutionary form is Hawthorne's, in connection with (as Roy Harvey Pearce has commented) \"[t]he idea of a 'book for the young' [which] evidently originated in conversations between Hawthorne and Longfellow in 1838,\" and which had its most genuine result in Hawthorne's A Wonder Book (1851): \" Possibly we may make a great hit, and entirely revolutionize the whole system of juvenile literature. I wish you would shape out your plan distinctly, and write. me about it .. \" (from Pearce, commenting on and quoting from Hawthorne's communications with Horace Mann [1849} and with Longfellow [1838], in \"Historical Introduction: True Stories, A Wonder Book, 200 \u00b7'Inglewood Tales,\" Vol. 6 [1972] of The Centenary Edition, 297-98, w. z\u00a7--6) The special qualities of Hawthorne's \"re-working of his source material\" for the Perseus (or for \"The Gorgon's aead\" [_9!, and signature-read in in Subsection II.B.2.c as example ii), include: the use of a frame \"narrator [who] is doing something that he likes[--]telling a story to a group of children with whom he is relaxed, and whose demands on the speaker are direct and definable [(so that h]is tone is informal, eqen colloquial, and \u00b7his imagination embellishes the framework of his story freely, but without complication or tediousness[)]\"; the further \"realizing [of] dramatic possibilities,\" or the giving [of} form and vitality\" through reliance \"upon movement, talk, and incident[, e]ven more upon suspense\"; and the \"el~boration of detail and use of humour,\" with the \"elaboration ['occasionally' becoming] : merely fanciful--a weakness never overc[o]me entirely [by Hawthorne, and], perhaps, the price paid for a similar kind of elaboration which adds a symbolic dimension to whatever it touches\" (from Hugo McPherson, discussing Hawthorne's re-use of materials from Charles Anthon's A Classical Dictionary, 4th ed. [New York: Harper, 1848]--in Hawthorne as Myth-Maker: A Study Univ. of Toronto Press, 1969], pp. 51-54). Subsequent bibliogr. references to Hawthorne's texts for children occur parenthetically within the text of my Sections II.B.2 and II.B.3; and the identification of passages quoted in II.B.2-3 from Hawthorne's prefaces to those texts (in II.B.3 as \"The Master's Frame\") occurs parenthetically or in brackets within the text of the same two Sections. 7\"Article[J XII.

As article twelve in the collection, the essay immediately follows--and as though mocks and elaborates and article, Elizabeth takes issue with Horace Bushnell's God in Christ (1849), or with his ultimate appeal to convention on questions of form and meaning in language; she advocates Charles Kraitsir's The Significance of the Alphabet (1837[? 1846?]), or his articulatory philology in \"the investigation of truth,\" or the \"pre\u00ad established law connecting the mind and outward nature with each other\" Which in Biblical parable gave Adam the power \"to name\" the \"creatures\" properly (Peabody, p. 215); and Herder's Vom Geist ~r Hebraischen lexicology, ~pistemologically based on audio-phonetic ultimate constituents of (;nguage, and \"Oriental [ly]\" rooted in botanical, or garden, metaphor eabody on/from Herder, p. 222). (See my I.End Notes.l2 excerpt 201 f 0111 Kraitsir' s Glossology [1852]; see R. H.

As a possible pseudonymous piece by Hawthorne, the \"Vegetation\" essay would occur as a second (coy) contribution to the collection of \"papers\"; \"N. HAWTHORNE, Esq.\" is already represented by \"Article[] VIII. Main-street\" (p. v and pp. 145- 74). As coy journalism, it may well function satirically, or as a private turn on the floral word turning tour de force, and high-literary remark at once on Herder's environmentalist-nationalist theories of the development of languages and literatures, on Hawthorne's own keen sense of his Anglo-American family history, and on his very love of lexical puzzles in the maintenance of (a la Randall Stewart) \"sub-rosa\" social connections. (On the sub-rosa puzzles, see: Randall Stewart, Hawthorne: Boyhood of Hawthorne,\" in Wide Awake: An Illustrated Magazine, November 1891, eds. Charles S. Pratt and Ella F. Pratt [Boston: D. Lathrop, 1891], p. 515; and, my I.End Notes.ll [b], the testimony of Horatio Bridge. See also \"sub rosa\" as discussed under \"[R]ose\" by John W. Hazen, in Leach [1949-50]; cf. Hawthorne's remarks on England's historical Roses, in Our Old Home (1863), Vol. 5 of The Centenary Edition, 184, 254 [-55], and other pages.) The especial value of the essay lies in its strong, heraldic characteri\u00ad zation of an \"American hawthorn\" (p. 228), less passive, more colorful than Hawthorne's usual direct reference to the shrub in his auxiliary writings (e.g., Our Old Home, CE, V:52,200)--with direct reference as though magically tabu .in the literary texts proper. Also, the essay links Hawthorne as name-turner with the tradition of English Christ\u00ad confessional literary gardens, addressing themselves to the Neoplatonic Christ Sun:Son pun-standard of formal and moral temperance (e.g., Sidney, Milton, my IV.End Notes.l2), (Note also: Donald R. Eidson, \"The Sun as Symbol and Type of Christ in English Non-Dramatic Poetry from The Anglo-Saxon Period Through the Victorian Period,\" Dissertation Abstracts International, Vol. 30, No. 10 [April 1970], 4407A-8A [Univ. of Missouri]; Norma W.

Finally, the essay as botanical-lexical habitat of mind reinforces Hawthorne's conn~ction with the notion of an oral-germinal verbal art, in which the mouth is tr~sforming cause/ criterion/meaning of a complete poetic world-\u00ad relnforces the notion of an oral-germinal verbal-minding/scaling as the 202 heart of his technique of adaptation for children and of art beyond.

Bawl as throat/crypt]; and one inhabitant after another turned aside from the street to look into the grave, and talk with the digger. I heard him laugh, with the hereditary mirthfulness of ~en of that occupation. I In a hollow of the woods, yesterday afternoon, I lay a long while watching a squirrel, who was capering about among the trees (oaks and white-pines, so close together that their branches intermingled) over my head. The squirrel seemed not to approve of my presence; for he frequently uttered a sharp, quick, angry noise, like that of a scissor-grinder's wheel. Sometimes I could see him sitting on an impending bough, with his tail over his back, looking down pryingly upon me; it seems to be a natural posture with him to sit on his hind legs, holding his fore-paws. Anon, with a peculiarly quick start, he would scamper along the branch, and be lost to sight in another part of the tree, whence his shrill chatter would again be heard. Then I would see him rapidly descending the trunk, and running along the ground; and a moment afterwards, casting my eyes upward, I beheld him flitting like a bird among the high interweaving branches, at the summits of the trees, directly over my head. Afterawhile, he apparently became accustomed to my presence, and set about some business of his. He descend~d the trunk of a tree to the ground, TOOK UP A PIECE OF A DECAYED BOUGH OF A TREE, (A GREAT BURTHEN FOR SUCH A SMALL PERSONAGE) AND, WITH THIS IN HIS MOUTH, AGAIN CLIMBED THE TREE, AND PASSED FROM THE BRANCF~S OF THAT TO THOSE OF ANOTHER, AND THUS ONWARD AND ONWARD, TILL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT [capitals mine]. Shortly afterWards he returned for another burthen; and this he repeated several times. I suppose he was building a nest--at least, I know not what else could have been his object. Never was there such an active, cheerful, choleric, continually\u00ad in-motion fellow, as THIS LITTLE RED SQUIRREL--TALKING TO HIMSELF, CHATTERING AT ME, and as sociable in his own person as if he had half a dozen companions, instead of being alone in the lonesome wood. Indeed, he flitted about so quickly, and showed himself in different places so suddenly, that I was in some doubt whether there were not two or three of him. I I must mention again the very beautiful effect produced by the masses of blueberry (or whortle-berry) lying like SCARLET ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF WITHERED PASTURE-GROUND, OR CROWNING THE TOPS OF BARREN HILLS. Their hue, at a distance, is a LUSTROUS SCARLET; although it does not look nearly so bright and beautiful, when examined close at hand. But, at a proper distance, it is A BEAUTIFUL FRINGE ON AUTUMN'S PETTICOAT ['Autumn's'--with initial capital]. I I I A continual succession of unpleasant Novembry days; and Autumn has made rapid progress in the work of decay. It is now somewhat of a rare good fortune to find a verdant grassy spot, on some slope, or in a hollow [cf. Haw! as throat/cavity]; and even such seldom seen oases are bestrewn with dried brown leaves;--which, however, methinks, make the short fresh grass look greener around them. Dry leaves are now plentiful everywhere, save where there are none but pine-trees; they rustle beneath the tread-\u00ad and there is nothing more autumnal than that sound. \" (CE, , men's.heads drop off\"], 161 [\"sunny . spots of woodland, boys in sear.ch of nuts laughter and joyous ~oices,-- elastic and gladsome Heaps of dry leaves, tossed together by the wind, as if f~r a couch and lounging-place for the weary tra~eller, while the sun is warming it for him\"], 185 [\"A ground sparrow's nest in the slope of a bank and open wide mouths for food,-- broad gape. another egg, a coffin, the quiet, death-like .form of the little bird\"], 228 [\"on his way from the beach to his mistress's residence; found dead in a cavity between the rocks\"].) 11Relevant to the super-jaws fantasy of the chair, as oro-tectonic rose-calyx with zoo-dynamic interior yell! process (haw as multi-syzygial hip), are the following scholarly comments by Grace Farrell Lee, on her own study of the grotesque (1973, 1980)--comments followed up, in turn, with grotesque-reinforcing additional remarks by Hawthorne, on the chair itself (1841, 1851) and on his own chair-hued physiognomy (1862). The collllllents by Grace Farrell Lee, from \"The Grotesque: A Demonic Tradition,\" Dissertation Abstracts International, Vol. 40, No. 7 (Jan. 1980), 4012A (Brown Univ.): \"The grotesque in both art and literature has yet to be adequately defined. In contemporary usage, the word, divorced from its sixteenth century roots, has become a catch-all ranging from the terrifyingly comic to the ludicrously depraved. In literary criticism it is used in conjunction with caricature, tragi-comedy, and gothic, or to describe bizarre or deformed characters. I The word derives from grotta, cave. It refers to sixteenth century Roman excavations in which first century ornamental paintings were discovered. The ancient murals, imitated by early Renaissance painters, reveal fantastic images, half human, half bestial, emerging from unfurled leaves atop delicate flower stems. Decorative lines are full of an incongruous mix of figures which defy the laws of balance and physics and intermingle categories of being. I Because the grotesques are not imitative of a classically oriented reality, critics have consistently defined them as distorted and deformed, as monstrous fantasies without relation to the 'real.' But the norms of verisimilitude are inadequate to any analysis of this art. Grotesques are not abortive imitations of a rational world view. Rather, they subvert the very notion that reality is an objective construct, predictable and understandable. The grotesque annihilates logic and order, presenting the world as filtered through a dream, a sequence of surreal images in which form flows into form as boundaries dissolve and hallucinatory creatures come into being. It is a dream\u00ad vision which pierces the facade of order and reason, of normality and certitude, questioning the existence of the empirical world, and suggesting the possibility that what man has been taught to see as real is only an illusion, useful in staying the forces of chaos, but counter\u00ad feit. I [My] Chapter one analyzes two interrelated problems which have le~ to contemporary notions of the grotesque: semantic confusions with\u00b7 adJectival synonyms and, more importantly, the identification of the grotesque with the Gothic gargoyle. This identification is the root of confusion of the grotesque with deformity, ugliness, caricature, and 205 tragi-comedy. The two are distinguished in both art and literature in terms of form and philosophy; fundamentally the Gothic is an agent of order, while the grotesque is a principle of chaos. I [My]-Chapter two further delineates the grotesque by differentiating it from caricature and tragi-comedy. It also analyzes the misconceptions involved in confusing the grotesque with distortion. I [My] Chapter three discusses the grotesque as a d~onic principle of chaos which infiltrates the created world, disregarding all forms and distinctions of order, blending man and beast, flower and machine, infusing designs with movement and life, and defying all laws of reason. In I. B. Singer [late 20th cent.], where community has religious significance as a microcosm of Divine order, the grotesque, as a potential destroyer of that community, embodies evil and corruption. The grotesque manifests itself in Singer's devils and dybbuks, ever lurking on the periphery of the ~nseen world, tempting man to destruction and in his landscapes, which are suffused with the chthonic powers of storm. I [My] Chapter four discussed the demonism of the grotesque as a positive, subversive force which exposes the created order of society as fraudulent. In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn [M. Twain, 1884] chaos, imaged in the fluidity of the river and in the free play of the imagination not restrained by conven\u00ad tion, is a force which destructures a bogus reality. I [My] Chapter five discusses the demonism of silence, the final victory of the grotesque over the created order. In Beckett's Endgame [1958], the process of creation is reversed, incoherence itself is dramatized, and every allusion which permeates the language of the play is transformed into rubbish thrown into a trashcan abyss, there to mock the human-debris in its search for meaning.\" The additional remarks by Hawthorne on the chair itself, from Grandfather's Chair (1841, 1851), in Vol. 6 (1972) of The Centenary Edition, 19: \"Now the chair, in which Gra~dfather sat, was made of oak, which had grown dark with age, but had been rubbed and polished till it shone as bright as mahogany [=near-haw reddish]. It was very large and heavy, and had a back that rose [as oak/mahogany/ hawthorn-rose] high above Grandfather's white head. This back was curiously carved in open-work, so as to represent flowers and foliage, and other devices, which the children had often gazed at, but could never understand what they meant. On the very tiptop of the chair, over the head of Grandfather himself, was the likeness of a lion's head, which had such a savage grin, that you would [over-the-wood!] almost expect to hear it growl and snarl. [Cf. lion extract, my Chapter I, motto.] I The children had seen Grandfather sitting in this chair, ever since they could remember anything. Perhaps the younger of them supposed that he and the chair had come into the world together, and that both had always been as\u00b7old as they were now. At this time, however [haw-over!], it happened to be the fashion for ladies to adorn their drawing-rooms with the oldest and oddest chairs that could be found. . .. \" The additional remarks by Hawthorne on his own chair-hued physiognomy, i.e., as bio-realized cognominy, from Letter to Mrs. ~wthorne (writ.

The study has suggested (in the conclusion of Chapter II) five key principles by means of which the literary work~ of Hawthorne may be brought into a concordance for purposes of assessing the higher literary qualifications of Hawthorne's signature-voice--Hawthorne's signature- 208 209 voice, that is, as his heart-demand for public and evident recognition, for providential and real life-and-death blessings. Those key prin- ciples would operate, the study has indicated, at each .step of a five\u00ad step scale of consonant-figures with oral-tags, which it has developed' (in II.B.l) in a mediatory application of Richard Paget's oral-gestural theory of consonant sounds to Hawthorne's text of literary signatures, and which it has tried (in II.B.2~3) for a message of Christian botanical-literary kingship in the context of Hawthorne's'writings for children. (Summarized as a power of Hawthorne's serpent master- symbol, or as the form of its consonant-chant, or as point l2.a] in the sectional closing of II.B.l--the scale of consonant-figures with oral- tags was tried in II.B.2-3 with the support of its variant statements, summary points [ l.a-c] and [2.b-c] .) The study makes application of the key principles and the scale in the present chapter of the thesis. The study undertakes, in the chapter development {or Part B), a literary unfolding of five five-fold signature-petitions for a privy-symbolic, well-warded, thorn-apple of world. Sampling broad,ly of passages from one hundred and three works (or drawing two hundred and three scale-keyed passages from ninety-two tales, five novels, and s~x unfinished works2), that unfolding of the signature-petitions for the draconic yet undersating all-round haw-in- 3 mouth in the chapter development constitutes the systematic evidence of the higher literary qualification, the burgeoning into significant literary existence, of Hawthorne's signature-poetic. Also, as the study remarks in the conclusion of the chapter (or Part C), that r 210 systematic unfolding of the signature-petitions prepares the way for assessing, in the. evaluative fourth chapter of the thesis, the con\u00ad straint of Hawthorne's signature-poetic upon interpretation, and uniquely Milton4-echoing oral-gestural voice in the context of literary recognition, even when that context blesses. The five key principles of scale-application which in the development o~ the chapter serve to guide the study of Hawthorne's literary works may be abbreviated as follows: (B.l-S.a) a step talley of figure-rhymed titles; (B.l-S.b) a of organ-song; (B.l-S.c) a step sampling of breach-counterchant; (B.l-S.d) a step sampling of world-hymn; and (B.l-S.e) a step sampling of signature- elegy. Immediately below (in the chapter introduction) follow five sets of select miscellaneous passages--five passages per set (usually bracket-annotated), drawn from Hawthorne scholarship,5 Hawthorne's auxiliary writings and prefaces,6 and Hawthorne's literary works7-- intended to reinforce once more the idea of the serpentine-signatural master-form (of my I.C and II.B.l, closing points [l.a-c]) which underlies and empowers those principles (i.e., concordance principles 'a'-'e'). \u00b7 ( ' ' \u00b7 The fl.rst set of passages pass. set a --cf. s1gnature w. holy end-trail under nose) builds toward the idea of undulating ink-script on a high ledge as part of the serpentine function of Consummately name-suggestive entitlement; the second set of passages (pass. set 'b'--cf. signature w. throat-held gift shout) builds 211 toward the idea of visceral-oral cavities and motor-oral members as earth-born, chthonic, structures mimicked by and advancing themselves analogically in sacred and blasphemous human articulations--to become near-open baptismal and spine-protected, or serpent orocryphs; the third set of passages (pass. set 'c'--cf. signature w. engrafting tongue) builds toward the idea of dialogic amplification of literary agents as a tree-subtended function of demonic lingual-lingal forking--as a secretive name-enforced tail-to-mouth serpentine closure audibly burgeoning; (pass. set 'd'--cf. signature w. tip behind teething hedge) builds toward the idea of an eye-rounding but haw-hemmed and hem-hawed communal scenario of demonic consummation, as one of perfect, serpent\u00ad wise, mouth-apperception of an imperfectly realized, even illusory, orgastic fruit; and the fifth set of passages (pass. set 'e'--cf. signature w. embowing lips) builds toward the idea of decline to skeletal chamber of a potent spine-thong, the tongue--of the authorial voice left in a mouth-angled reliquary--as an act of humiliating self\u00ad rededication, to repeated viny and thorny, serpentine-sin(:)uous acts in a dark, minimally and maximally orofacially constrained, signatural scheme of Christian salvation. Ora pro Nathaniel Hawthorne; ora pro nobis. Immediately below that doubly five-fold introductional battery of select miscellaneous passages reconstructive of the oral romanesques (or earthen romancings) of Hawthorne's master-symbol--i.e., in the chapter development--follows the prime, literary unfolding of the signature-petitions. There, a 212 brief discussion of specific aspects of scale_-application in accord with the five key principles, and of outcomes of application not in discord with the signature-motives and the signature-anthem (my II.B.l, closing points [2.b-c]), serves to head each of the five signature- petitions, or hawthornesques, unfolded. The battery of passages to reinforce the serpentine master-form of Nathaniel Hawthorne reads as follows: Pass. set 'a'--the serpentine entitlement) [ 'a'--serpentine entitlement, one:] As had happened more than once before, Hawthorne_found it troublesome to decide on a title for his book. None of his diary, journal, or epistolary references to the work in progress identify it by theme, locale, character names, or any descriptive language; it is simply \"the Romance.\" In August [ 1859] he wrote Fields that he had no ideas for a title .IJ Two months later he sent Fields a sheaf of possibilities, none of which suited him exactly: \"'Monte Beni; or the Romance. I 'Marble and Life; a Romance.\"' He could see objections \"to an Italian name, though perhaps Monte Beni might do. Neither do I wish, if I can help it, to make the fantastic aspect of the book too prominent by putting the Faun into the title page\"--this despite the presence of that word in four of his proposed titles.[] I At Field's suggestion, Hawthorne settled on \"The Romance of Monte Beni,\" but Smith, Elder & Co. demurred and he gave them a list of possible alternatives.IJ Reporting these developments to Ticknor on December 1, but with no knowledge of Smith, Elder's decision, Hawthorne added: \" their choice need not govern yours, and, if you wish to announce the book, I should like to have you call it 'Saint Hilda's Shrine.' We can change the title afterwards, should it appear advisable.\"[] When he returned the first proof-sheets on December 6, his accompanying letter observed that despite Smith, Elder's disapproval of his original suggestion, the printers were using it (i.e., he could observe that \"Romance of Monte Beni\" was the running-title on all versos).[] On December 12 he noted in his pocket diary that he had proposed \"The Marble Faun\" as the British title, and on the twenty- , second he instructed Ticknor to use it also for the American \u00b7 edition, saying that he had rejected Smith, Elder's proposal, \"The 213 Transformation, or the Romance of Monte Beni.\"IJ As late as January 26, 1860, no decision on the British title had been reached,lJ but the matter was settled soon thereafter when the publishers pointed out that \"Transformation\" was in fact one of Hawthorne's sugges\u00ad tions.[] He continued to rail against it, saying to Fields that \"Smith & Elder (who seem to be pig-headed individuals) persist in calling the book 'Transformation,' which gives me the idea of Harlequin in pantomime\"; to Ticknor he wrote that the British publishers \"are determined to take a title out of their own heads, though they affirm that it was originally suggested by me I beseech you not to be influenced by their bad example.\" IJ A letter of February 10 to Ticknor declared, \"I am fully determined not to retain their absurd title.\"[] But on February 3 he had capitulated to Smith, Elder \"so far as the English edition is concerned. In American I shall call the book 'The Marble Faun.\"' IJ And so it turned out. In both countries the subtitle became The Romance of Monte Beni.[] (Claude M. Simpson, \"Introduction to The Marble Faun,\" CE, VII [1968], xxv-xxvii) [ 'a'--serpentine entitlement, two:] remembered, that Mr. Bright [fictive children's narrator] condescended to avail himself of my literary experience by constituting m~ editor of the Wonder Book. As he had no reason to complain of the reception of that erudite work, by the public., he was now disposed to retain me in a similar position, with respect to the present volume, which he entitled \"TANGLEWOOD TALES.\" Not, as Eustace hinted, that there was any real necessity for my services as introductor, inasmuch as his own name had become established, in some good degree of favor, with the literary world. But the connection with myself, he was kind enough to say, had been highly agreeable; nor was he by any means desirous, as most people are, of kicking away the ladder that had perhaps helped him to reach his present elevation. I Merely from the titles of the stories, I saw at once that the subjects were not less rich than those of the former volume; nor did I at all doubt that Mr. Bright's audacity (so far as that endowment might avail) had enabled him to take full advantage of whatever capabilities they offered. (Hawthorne, \"The UNPUBLISHED \"ALLEGORIES OF THE HEART\" ['*The physical fact, to which it is here attempted to give a moral sig\u00ad nification, has been known to occur in more than one instance. 'J \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 I Thus musing, he ['Herkimer'] took his stand at the entrance of the gate, and waited until the personage, so singularly announced, should make his appearance. After an instant or two, he beheld the 214 figure of a lean man, of unwholesome look, with glittering eyes and long [graphically] black hair, who seemed to imitate the motion of a snake; for instead of walking straight forward with open front, he undulated along the pavement in a curved line. It may be too fanciful to say, that something, either in his moral or material aspect, suggested the idea that a miracle had been wrought, by transforming a serpent into a man; but so imperfectly, that the snaky nature was yet hidden, and scarcely hidden, under the mere outward guis\u00b7e of humanity. Herkimer remarked that his complexion had a greenish tinge over its sickly white . I I Roderick seemed aware how generally he had become the subject of curiosity and conjecture, and with a morbid repugnance to such notice, or to any notice whatsoever, estranged himself from all companionship. Not merely the eye of man was a horror to him; not merely the light of a friend's countenance; but even the blessed sunshine, likewise, which in its universal beneficence, typifies the radiance of the Creator's face, expressing his love for all the creatures of his hand. The dusky twilight was now too transparent for Roderick Elliston; the blackest midnight was his chosen hour to steal abroad; and if ever he were seen, it was when the watchman's lantern gleamed upon his figure, gliding along the street, with his hands clutched upon his bosom, gnawed I I \"You are come! I have expected you,\" said Elliston, when he became aware of the sculptor's presence. I His manner was very different from that of the preceding day-\u00ad quiet, courteous, and, as Herkimer thought, watchful both over his guest and himself. This unnatural restraint was almost the only trait that betokened anything amiss. He has just thrown a book upon the grass, where it lay half-opened, thus disclosing itself to be a natural history of the serpent-tribe, illustrated by life-like plates. Near it lay that bulky volume, the Ductor Dubitantium of Jeremy Taylor, full of cases of conscience, and in which most men, possessed of a conscience, may find something applicable to their purpose. I \"You see,\" observed Elliston, pointing to the book of serpents, while a smile gleamed upon his lips, \"I am making an effort to become better acquainted with my bosom-friend. But I find nothing satisfactory in this volume. I\u00a3 I mistake not, he will prove to be sui generis, and akin to no other reptile in creation.\" I \"Whence came this calamity?\" inquired the sculptor. I \"My sable friend, Scipio ['the old black servant'] has a story,\" replied Roderick, \"of a snake that had lurked in this fountain ['Roderick was reclining on the margin of a fountain']--pure and innocent as it looks--ever since it was known to the first settlers. This insinuating personage once crept into the vitals of my great-grandfather, and dwelt there many years, tormenting the old gentleman beyond mortal endurance. In short, it is a family peculiarity. But to tell the truth, I have no faith in this idea of the snake's being an heir-loom. He 215 is my own snake, and no man's else.\" I \"But what is his origin?\" demanded Herkimer. I \"Oh! there is poisonous stuff in any man's heart, sufficient to generate a brood of serpents,\" said Elliston, with a hollow laugh. \"You should have heard my homilies to the good towns people. Positively, I deem myself fortunate in having bred but a single serpent. You, however, have none in your bosom, and therefore, cannot sympathize with the rest of the world. It gnaws me! It gnaws me!\" I With this exclamation, Roderick lost his self-control and threw himself upon the grass, cescifying his agony by intricate writhings {visibly viny, wavy writing] in which Herkimer could not but fancy a resemblance to the motions of a snake. Then, likewise, was heard that frightful hiss, which often ran through the sufferer's speech, and crept between the words and syllables, without interrupting their succession. I .. \"This is awful indeed!\" exclaimed the sculptor--\"an awful infliction, whether it be actual or imaginary! Tell me, Roderick Elliston, ~s there any remedy for this loathsome evil?\" I \"Yes, but an impossible one,\" muttered Roderick, as he lay wallowing with his face in the grass. \"Could I, for one instant, forget myself, the serpent might not abide within me. It is my diseased self\u00ad contemplation that has engendered and nourished him!\" I (Hawthorne, \"Egotism; or, The Bosom go on with me?\"--SOUTHEY. ['....

Look, Ellen I'Langton'], you can see the waving of his tail ['a trout of noble size'] from beneath the bank.\" I [/ And:] I There were many who felt an interest in Fanshawe; but the influence of none could prevail upon him to lay aside the habits, mental and physical, by which he was bringing himself to the [variously literal] grave. His passage thither was consequently rapid--terminating just as he reached his twentieth year. His fellow students erected to his memory a monument of rough-hewn granite, with a white marble slab, for the inscription. This was borrowed from the grave of Nathanael Mather, whom, in his almost insane eagerness for knowledge and in his early death, Fanshawe resembled. I THE ASHES OF A HARD STUDENT AND A GOOD SCHOLAR[.] I MANY tears were shed over his grave [cf. 'Manning'--maternal family name]; but the thoughtful and the wise, though turf never .covered a nobler heart, could not lament that it was so soon at rest. He left a world for which he was unfit; and we trust, that, among the innumerable stars of heaven, there is one where he has found happiness. I I It was not till four years after Fanshawe's death, that Edward Walcott 216 was united to Ellen L[o]ngton[gue]. Their future lives were uncom\u00ad monly happy. Ellen's gentle, almost imperceptible, but powerful influence, drew her husband away from the passions and pursuits that would have interfered with domestic felicity; and he never regretted the worldly distinction of which she thus deprived him. Theirs was a long life of calm and quiet bliss;--and what matters it; that, except in these pages, they have left no [typographic] name behind them?

I had lingered away from it, and wandered to other scenes, because my treasury of anticipated enjoyments, comprising all the wonders of the world, had nothing else so magnificent, and I was loth to exchange the pleasures of hope for those of memory so soon. At length, the day came. I At the toll-house, there were further excuses for delaying the inevitable moment. My signature was required in a huge leger, containing similar records innumerable, many of which I read. The skin of a sturgeon, and other fishes, beasts, and reptiles; a collection of minerals, such as lie in heaps near the falls; some Indian moccasins, and other trifles, made of deer-skin and embroidered with beads; several newspapers from Montreal, New-York, and Boston; all attracted me in turn. Out of a number of twisted sticks, the manufacture of a Tuscarora Indian, I selected one of curled maple, curiously convoluted, and adorned with the carved images of a snake and a fish. Using this as my pilgrim's staff, I crossed the bridge. I I The last day that I was to spend at Niagara, before my departure for the far west, I sat upon Table Rock. \u00b7 Never before had my mind been in such perfect unison with the scene. There were intervals, when I was conscious of nothing but the great river, rolling calmly into the abyss I At length, my time came to depart. There is a grassy footpath, through the woods, along the summit of the bank, to a point whence a causeway, [Haw:]hewn in the side of the precipice, goes winding down to the ferry, about half a mile below the Table Rock. The sun was near setting, when I emerged from the shadow of the trees, and began the descent. The [serpentine] indirectness of my downward road continually changed the point of view, and shewed me, in rich and repeated succession-\u00ad now, the whitening rapids and the majestic leap of the main river, which appeared more deeply massive as the light departed; now, the lovelier picture, yet still sublime, of Goat Island, with its rocks and grove, and the lesser falls, tumbling over the right bank of the St. Lawrence, like a tributary stream; now, the long vista of 217 the river, as it eddied and whirled between the cliffs, to pass through Ontario towards the sea, and everywhere to be wondered at for this one unrivalled scene. The golden sunshine tinged the sheet of the American cascade, and painted on its heaving spray the broken semicircle of a rainbow, Heaven's own beauty [(h)edge-]crown\u00ad ing earth's sublimity. My steps were slow, and I paused long at every turn of the descent, as one lingers and pauses, who discerns a brighter and brightening excellence in what he must soon behold no more. The solitude of the old wilderness now reigned over the whole vicinity of the falls. My enjoyment became the more rapturous, because no poet shared it--nor wretch, devoid of poetry, profaned it: but the spot, so famous through the world, was all my own! [ -n!: N n aw n!] (Hawthorne, \"My one:] Coming up the Dingley Bay {Maine], had a good view of Rattlesnake Mountain, and it seemed to me wonderfully beautiful as the almost setting sun threw over its western crags streams of fiery light. If the Indians were very fond of this part of the country, it is easy to se~ why. Beavers, otters, and the finest fish were abundant, and the hills and streams furnished constant variety. I should have made a good Indian if I had been born in a wigwam. To talk like sailors, we \"made\" the old hemlock stub, at the mouth of the Dingley Brook, just before sunset, and sent a boy ashore with a hawser, and were soon safely moored to a bunch of alders. I [I And:] Mr. March Gay killed a rattlesnake yesterday, not far from his house, that was more than six feet long, and had twelve rattles. This morning, Mr. Jacob Mitchell killed another near the same place, almost as long. It is supposed they were a pair, and that the second one was on the track of its mate. If every rattle counts a year, the first one was twelve years old. Eliakim Max\u00ad field came down to mill to-day, and told me about the snakes. I \u00b7 [I And:] A young man named Henry Jackson, Jr., was drowned two days ago, up in Crooked River. He and one of his friends were trying which could swim the faster. Jackson was behind but gaining; his friend kicked at him in fun, thinking to hit his shoulder and push him back, but missed, and hit his chin, which caused him to take in water and strangle, and before his friend could help or get help, poor Jackson was (Elder Leach (a Freewill Baptist minister] says) \"beyond the reach of mercy.\" I read one of the Psalms to my mother this morning, and it plainly declares twenty\u00ad six times, that \"God's mercy endureth forever.\" I never saw Henry Jackson,--he was a young man just married. Mother is sad; says she shall not consent to my swimming any more in the mill-pond, with .218 the boys, fearing that in sport my mouth might get kicked open, and then sorrow for a dead son be added to that for my dead father, which she says would break her heart. I love to swim, but shall not disobey my mother. I (The young Hawthorne [ca. 1819], Hawthorne's First Diary, ed. Samuel T.

Mr. Watkins tried to make me believe that he thought it a water\u00ad moccasin snake. Old Mr. Shane said that it was a \"young sea sarpint, sure.\" Mr. Fickett, the blacksmith, begged it to take for its skin, as he said for buskin strings and flail' strings. So ends my day's fishing. I [I And:] The lumbermen from Saccarappa are getting their logs across the Great Pond. Yesterday a strong northwest wind blew a great raft of many thousands over almost to the mouth of the Dingley Brook. Their anchor dragged for more than a mile, but when the boom was within twenty or thirty rods of the shore, it brought up and held, as I heard some men say who are familiar with such business. All the men and boys went from the mill down to the pond to see the great raft, a~d I among them.\u00b7 They have a string of logs fastened end to end and sur\u00ad rounding the great body, which keeps them from scattering; and the string is called a boom. A small strong raft, it may be forty feet square, with an upright windlass in its centre, called a capstan, is fastened to some part of the boom. The small raft is called \"head works,\" and from it, in a yawl boat, is carried the anchor, to which is attached a strong rope half a mile long. The boat is rowed out the whole length of the rope, the anchor thrown over, and the men on the \"head works\" wind up the capstan, a~d so draw along the acres of logs. It turned out that ['Reuben'] March only rode the single log ashore to show his adroitness I 'This masterly kind of navigation he calls \"cuffing the rigging.\" Nobody could tell me why he gave it that name'], for the yawl boat soon came round from the head works, and brought near a dozen men, in red shirts, to where we were. I was interested in listening to their conversation, mixed with sharp jokes. Nearly every one had a nickname. March, who came after the rum, was called \"Captain Snarl;\" a tall, fierce looking man, who had just filled my idea of a Spanish freebooter, was \"Doctor Coodle.\" I think his real name was Wood. The rum seemed to make them crazy, for one who was called \"Rub-a-Dub\" pitched Doctor Coodle, head and heels, into the water. A gentlemanly man named Thompson, who acted as master of ceremonies, or Grand Turk, interfered and put a stop to what was becoming something like a fight. Mr. Thompson said that the wind would go down with the sun, and that they must get ready to start. 219 This morning I went down to look for them, and the raft was almost to Frye's Island. I (The young Hawthorne [ca. the boys along the street.--\"Here comes the man with a snake in his bosom!\" I This outcry, saluting Herkimer's ears, as he ~ras about to enter the iron gate of the Elliston mansion, made him pause. It was not without a shudder that he found himself on the point of meeting his former acquaintance, whom he had known in the glory of youth, and whom now, after an interval of five years, he was to find the victim either of a diseased fancy, or a horrible physical misfortune. I \"A snake in his bosom!\" repeated the young sculptor to himself. \"It must be he. No second man on earth has such a bosom-friend! I I The wretched being approached the gate, but, instead of entering, stopt short, and fixed the glitter of his eye full upon the compassionate, yet steady countenance of the sculptor. I \"It gnaws me! It gnaws me!\" he exclaimed. I And then there was an audible hiss, but whether it came from the apparent lunatic's own lips, or was the real hiss of a serpent, might admit of discussion. At all events, it made Herkim~r shudder to his heart's core. I \"Do you know me, George Herkimer?\" asked the snake-possessed. I Herkimer did know him. But it demanded all the intimate and practical acquaintance with the human face, acquired by modelling actual likenesses in clay, to recognize the features of Roderick Elliston in the visage that now met the sculptor's gaze. Yet it was he. I I \"It gnaws me! It gnaws me!\" muttered Roderick. I With this exclamation, the most frequent in his mouth, the unfortunate man clutched both hands upon his breast, as if an intolerable sting or torture impelled him to rend it open, and let out the living mischief, even were it intertwined with his own life. He then freed himself from Herkimer's grasp, by a subtle motion, and gliding through the gate, took refuge in his antiquated family residence. I I ...

The doomed sufferer submitted to his fate, resumed his former loathsome affection for the bosom-fiend, and spent whole miserable days before a looking-glass, with his mouth Ijaws-and-soft-foldsJ wide open, watching, in hope and horror, to catch Iat least] a [uvula-like] glimpse of the snake's head, far down within his throat. It is supposed that he succeeded; for the attendants once heard a frenzied shout, and rushing into the room, found Roderick lifeless upon the floor. I He was kept but little longer under restraint. After minute investigation, the medical directors of the asylum decided that his mental disease did not amount to ~nsanity, nor would warrant his confinement; especially as its tnfluence upon his spirits was unfavorable, and might produce the 220 evil which it was meant to remedy. His eccentricities were doubtless great Roderick was released, and had returned to his native city, the very day before his encounter with George Herkimer. I (Hawthorne, \"Egotism; or, The Bosom ingressive, mouth-reading, sequence--including egregious oral\u00ad egression]. More than once, it is true, he had been heard to say, clutching his hands to his breast--\"It gnaws me! It gnaws me!-\u00ad but, by different auditors, a great diversity of explanation was assigned to this ominous expression. What could it be, that gnawed the breast of Roderick Elliston? Was it sorrow? Was it merely the [superficial if sub-facial] tooth of physical disease? Or, in his reckless course, often verging upon profligacy, if not plunging into its depths, had he been guilty of some deed, which made his bosom a prey to the deadlier [and deeper--twin initial--] fangs of remorse? There was plausible ground for each of these conjectures; but;. it must not be c-oncealed that more than one elderly gentleman, the victim of good cheer and slothful habits, magisterially pro\u00ad nounced the secret of the whole matter [if grabbed by throat (hole)] to be Dyspepsia! I I After a time, it became known that Elliston was in the habit of resorting to all the noted quacks that infested the city, or whom money would tempt to journey thither from a distance. By one of these persons, in the exultation of a supposed cure, it was proclaimed far and wide, by dint of hand\u00ad bills and little pamphlets on dingy paper, that a distinguished gentleman, Roderick Elliston, Esq., had been relieved of a SNAKE in his stomach! So here was the monstrous secret, ejected from its lurking-place into public view in all its horrible deformity [i.e., as though t~ngue--in its visceral and metaphorical (groove\u00ad miming) extensity]. The mystery was out; but not so the bosom\u00ad serpent. He, if it were anything but a delusion, still lay coiled in his living den.

There were autumnal fevers, too; and a contagious and destructive throat- distemper--diseases unwritten in medical books. I I II . [ .] I ... I Take my arm, gentle reader, and come with me into some street [A]nd still more amazing is the presence of whole rows of wooden and plastered houses, projecting over the sidewalks, and bearing iron figures on their fronts, which prove them to have stood on the same sites above a century. Along the ghostly street, there are ghostly people too. March on, thou shadowy troop! and vanish, ghostly crowd! and change again, old street! for those stirring times are gone. I Opportunely for the conclusion of our sketch, a fire broke out, on the twentieth of March, 1760, at the Brazen-Head in Cornhill, and consumed nearly four hundred buildings. I I III . [.] I it may be the most effective method of going through the present file of papers, to follow out this idea, and transform ourself, per\u00ad chance, from a modern Tory into such a sturdy King-man [cf. king cobra (Naja Hannah)] as once wore that pliable nickname. I Well then, here we sit, sour-visaged, . erect enough .. loyal, to the back-bone .... idolizing King George, in secresy and silence--one true old heart, amongst a host of enemies. We watch, with a weary hope, for the moment when all this turmoil shall subside, and the impious novelty, that has distracted our latter years, like a wild dream, give place to the blessed quietude of royal sway, with the King's name in every ordinance, his prayer in the church, his health at the board, and his love in the people's heart. I Such an old man among new things are we, who now hold, at arm's length, the rebel newspaper of the day. The very figure-head, for the thousandth time, elicits a groan of [spit\u00ad filled] spiteful lamentation. Where are the united heart and crown, the loyal emblem, that used to hallow the sheet . ? In its stead, we find a continental officer, with the Declaration of Independence in one hand, a drawn sword in the other, and, above his head, a scroll, bearing the motto 'WE APPEAL TO HEAVEN.' Then say we, with a prospective triumph, let Heaven ju-dge, in its own good time! [I.e., the round-peeled fruit of the Revolution.] The material of the sheet attracts our scorn. It is a fair specimen of rebel manufacture, thick and coarse, like wrapping-paper, all overspread with little [ovule-like] knobs, and of such a deep, dingy blue color [leaden-haw], that we wipe our spectacles thrice 222 before we can distinguish a letter of that wretched print. Thus, in all points, the newspaper is a type of the times, far more fit for the rough hands of a democratic mob, than for our own delicate, though bony fingers. Nay; we will not handle it without our gloves! I I Here, flaunting down a whole column, with official seal and sign~ture, here comes a proclamation. By whose authority? Ah! the Unitea States--those thirteen little anarchies, assembled in that one grand anarchy, their Congress. And what the import? A general Fast. By Heaven! for once, the traitorous blockheads have legislated wisely! Yea; let a misguided people kneel down in sackcloth and ashes, from end to end, from border to border of their wasted country [and waste-paper]. Well may they fast [hold ink in mouth], where there is no food--and cry aloud [yell-oh!], for whatever remnant of God's mercy thei~ sins may not have exhausted. [Cf. Rever-end All-en R(v)oyce.] I I The present volume [grooved grove] of newspapers contains fewer characteristic traits than any which we have looked over [S]o it is, that in those elder volumes, we seem to find the life of a past age preserved between the leaves, like a dry specimen of foliage. (Hawthorne, \"Old Saturday we ['Herman Melville' and I] went to Chester together. I love to take every opportunity of going to Chester; it being the only one place, within easy reach of Liverpool, which possesses any old English interest. I We went to [the cathedral.] Its gray nave impressed me more than at any former visit. Passing into the cloisters, an attendant took possession of us, and showed us about. I Within the choir there is a profusion of very rich oaken carving, both on the screen that separates it from the nave, and on the seats and walls; very curious and most elaborate, and lavished (one would say) most wastefully, where nobody would think of looking for it, --where, indeed, amid the dimness of the cathedral, the exquis\u00ad ite detail of the elaboration could not possibly be seen. Our guide lighted some of the gas-burners .. There was a row of niches, where the monks used to stand for four hours together, in the performance of some of their services; and to relieve them a little, they were allowed partially to sit on a projection of the seats, which were turned up in the niche for that purpose; but if they grew drowsy, so as to fail to balance themselves, the seat was so contrived as to slip down, thus bringing the monk to the floor. These projections on the seats are each and all of them carved with curious devices, no two alike. The guide showed us one, represent\u00ad ing, apparently, the first quarrel of a new-married couple, wrought 223 with wonderful expression. Indeed, the artist never failed to bring out his idea in the most striking mannei,--as, for instance, Satan under the guise of a lion, devouring a sinner bodily; and again in the figure of a dragon with a man halfway down his gullet, the [two] legs hanging out. The carver may not have seen anything grotesque in this, nor intended it at all by way of a joke One does not see why such fantasies should be strewn about the holy interior of a cathedral, unless it were intended to contain every\u00ad thing that belongs to the heart of man, both upward and downward. I (Hawthorne, . English [two Puritan] ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent, and ask pardon of Heaven for their cruelties; or whether they are now [throat-]groaning under the heavy consequences of them, in another state of being. At all events, I, the present writer, as their representative, hereby take shame upon myself for their sakes, and pray that any curse incurred by them--as I have heard, and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of the race, for many a long year back, would argue to exist--may be now and henceforth removed. I Doubtless, however, either of these [two] stern and black-browed Puritans [i.e., with faces shielded under hard palate (by N-contin\u00ad uant 'I[:eYe]')] would have thought it quite a sufficient retribu\u00ad tion for his sins, that, after so long a lapse of years, the old trunk [--i.e., unlidded (revealed) truncated neck--] of the family tree, with so much venerable moss upon it, should have borne, as its topmost bough, an idler [cf. lingual-lingal sporter] like myself. No aim that I have cherished, would they recognize as laudable; no success of mine--if my life, beyond its domestic scope, had ever been brightened by success--would th~y deem otherwise than worthless, if not positively disgraceful. \"What is he?\" murmurs one gray shadow of my forefathers to the other. \"A writer of story-books! What kind of a business in life,--what mode of glo\u00ad rifying God, or being serviceable to mankind in his day and generation,--may that be? Why, the degenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler!\" Such are the [dialogic] compliments bandied between my great-grandsires and myself, across the [my\u00ad mother-and-my-mouth-embraced] gulf of time! And yet, let them scorn me as they will [i.e., feed me with my own self-excoriations], strong traits of their nature ['Bible The dragon had probably heard the voices; for swift as lightning, his black head and forked tongue came hissing among the trees again, darting full forty feet at a stretch. As it approached, Medea tossed the con\u00ad tents of the gold box right down the monster's wide-open throat. Immediately, with an outrageous hiss and a tremendous wriggle-\u00ad flinging his tail up to the tip-top of the tallest tree, and shattering all its branches as it crashed heavily down again--the dragon fell at full length upon the ground, and lay quite motion\u00ad less. I \"It is only a sleeping-potion,\" said the enchantress to Prince Jason. \"One always finds a use for these mischievous creatures, sooner or later; so I did not wish to kill him outright. Quick! Snatch the prize, and let us begone! You have won the Golden Fleece!\" I [ 'G. F. ' =metamorphosed Italy beats us, I think, in musquitoes; they are horribly pungent little particles of Satan. I do believe the Devil multiplies [amplifies] himself by the mil\u00ad lions, and infests our nights in this guise. They possess strange intelligence, and exquisite acuteness of sight and smell--prodi\u00ad gious audacity, and caution to match it, insomuch that they venture on the most hazardous attacks and get safe off. They absolutely creep into bed, and bite us in our strong holds. One of them flew into my mouth the other night [--i.e., as though a new (gNat-) word--], and stung me far down in my throat; but luckily I coughed him [Haw-hacked him] up in halves [as two]. They are bigger than American musquitoes [Italian words], and if you crush them, after one of their feats, it makes a terrific blood-spot. It is a sort of suicide--at least a shedding of one's own [etymologic] blood-- to kill them; but it gratifies the old Adam to do it. It shocks me to feel how revengeful I am; but it is impossible not to impute a certain malice and intellectual venom to these diabolical insects. I wonder whether our health, at this season of the year, requires that we should be kept in a state of irritation, and so the musquitoes [Italian words] are Nature's prophetic remedy for some disease; or whether we are made for the musquitoes [Italian words], not they for us. It is possible--just the infini\u00ad tesimal doses of poison [i.e., systemic challenge] which they infuse into us are a homeopathic safeguard against pestilence; but medicine never was administered in a more disagreeable way. I The moist atmosphere about the Arno, I suppose, produces these insects, and fills the broad, ten-mile valley with them; and as we are just on the brim of the basin, they overflow into our windows [i.e., chthonic-draconic eyes]. [I =Breach of tongue-root, with It may be too fanciful to say, that something, either in his moral or material aspect, suggested the idea that a miracle had been wrought, by transforming a serpent into a man; but so imperfectly, that the snaky nature was yet hidden, and scarcely hidden, under the mere outward guise of humanity. Herkimer remarked that his complexion had a greenish tinge over its sickly white, reminding him of a species of marble out of which he had once wrought a head of Envy, with her snaky locks. I The wretched being approached the gate, but, instead of entering, stopt short, and fixed the glitter of his eye full upon the compassionate, yet steady countenance of the sculptor. I \"It gnaws me! It gnaws me!\" he exclaimed. I And then there was an audible hiss, but whether i.t came from the apparent lunatic's own lips, or was the real hiss of a serpent, might admit of discussion. At all events, it made Herkimer shudder to his heart's core. I I Shortly after Elliston's separation from his wife--now nearly four years ago [c\u00a3. four legs, limbs, prongs]--his associates had observed a singular gloom spreading over his daily life [cf. single prong, phallic member, generating lingual over-shadow], like those chill, grey mists that sometimes steal away the sunshine from a summer's morning. The symptoms caused them endless perplexity. They knew not whether ill health were robbing his spirits of elasticity; or whether a canker of the mind was gradually eating, as such cankers do, from his moral system into the physical frame, which is but a shadow of the former. They looked for the root of this trouble in his shattered schemes of domestic [cf. patronymic] bliss--wilfully shattered by himself [i.e., for poetic re-use, extension, of single-rooted dia-log, in intensifying ana-logs]--but could not be satisfied of its existence there. Some thought that their once brilliant friend was in an incipient stage of insanity, of which his passionate [animative] impulses had perhaps been the fore\u00ad runners [cf. Nathaniel natal-eel(s)]; waste]. From Roderick's own lips [his seminal seal], they could learn nothing. I I From this time [i.e., later], the miserable sufferer ceased to 'shun the world, but rather solicited and forced himself upon the notice of acquaintances and strangers. It was partly the result of desperation, on finding that the cavern of his own bosom had not proved deep and dark enough to hide the secret, even while it was so secure a fortress for the loathsome fiend that had crept into it. But still more, this craving for notoriety was a symptom of the intense morbidness which now pervaded his nature. All persons, chronically diseased, are egotists, whether the disease be of the mind or body; whether it be sin, sorrow, or merely the more tolerable calamity of some endless pain, or mischief among the cords of mortal life [cf. vocal cords, with germ-infested throat-haw]. Such individuals are made acutely conscious of a self, by the torture in which it dwells. 226 Self, therefore, grows to be so prominent an object with them, that they cannot but present it to the face of every casual passer-by. There is a pleasure--perhaps the greatest of which the sufferer is susceptible--in displaying the wasted or ulcerated limb [cf. torn thorn-tongue], or the cancer in the breast [cf. lip\u00ad climbing crest-rose]; and the fouler the crime, with so much the more difficulty does the perpetrator prevent it from thrusting up its snake-like head [cf. larynx with tongue-root--stressed by Haw!--], to frighten the world; for it is that cancer! or that crime, which constitutes their respective individuality [cf. Ameri-can literary-metaphoric identity]. Roderick Elliston, who, a little while before, had held himself so scornfully above the common lot of men, now paid full allegiance to this humiliating law. The snake in his bosom seemed the symbol of a monstrous egotism, to which everything was referred, and which he pampered, night and day, with a continual and exclusive sacrifice of devil\u00ad worship. He soon exhibited what most people considered indubitable tokens of insanity. In some of his moods, strange to say, he prided and gloried himself on being marked out from the ordinary experience of mankind, by the possession of a double nature, and a life within a life [i.e., poetic energy, energeia, as self\u00ad fulfilling crossings of Natal-tail-into-Maw-with-split-tongue]. He appeared to i~agine that the snake was a divinity--not celestial, it is true, but darkly infernal--and that he thence derived an eminence and a sanctity, horrid, indeed, yet more desirable than whatever ambition [ambi-valent-ly] aims at. Thus he drew his misery around him like a regal mantle [cf. hood of soft palate, with (all) contiguous soft folds of mouth], and looked down triumphantly upon those whose vitals nourished no deadly monster. Oftener, however, his human nature asserted its empire over him, in the shape of a yearning [cf. yarning] for fellowship [i.e., lingual engrafing as dia-log-ing]. It grew to be his custom to spend the whole day in wandering about the streets, aimlessly, unless it might be called an aim, to establish a species of brotherhood between himself and the world. With cankered ingenuity, he sought out his own disease [i.e., corresponding signature-features] in every breast. Whether insane or not, he showed so keen a perception of frailty, error, and vice, that many persons gave him credit for being possessed not merely with a serpent, but with an actual fiend, who imparted this evil faculty of recognizing whatever was ugliest in man's heart. For instance, he met an individual, who, for thirty years, had cherished a hatred against his own brother. Roderick, amidst the throng of the street, laid his hand on this man's chest, and looking full into his forbidding face, I \"How is the snake [ache] to-day?\"--he inquired, with a mock expression of sympathy. I \"The snake! [ache!]\" exclaimed the brother-hater--\"What do persisted Roderick. \"Did you take counsel [ -el] with him this morning, when you should have been saying your 227 prayers? Did he sting [-thorn-] when[-n] you [th-]thought of your[-r] brother's health, wealth, and good repute? Did he caper for joy, when you remembered the profligacy of his only son? [El's natal-one?] And whether he stung, or whether he frolicked, did you feel his poison throughout your body and soul, converting everything to sourness and bitterness? [Cf. Oberon, as over-run.] That is the way of such serpents. I have learned the whole nature of them from my own!\" I \"Where is the police? [pole, long-arm, with poultice?]\" reared the object of Roderick's persecution, at the same time giving an instinctive clutch to his breast. \"Why is this lunatic allowed to go at large?\" I \"Ha, hal [Haw, haw!]\" chuckled Roderick, releasing his grasp of the man.--\"His bosom\u00ad serpent has stung him then!\" I Often, it pleased the unfortunate young man to vex people with a lighter satire, yet still character- ized by somewhat of snake-like virulence. I ' I Two ladies, rivals in fashionable life, who tormented one another with a thousand little stings[de l'Au-be-pin(s)] of womanish spite, were given to understand, that each of their hearts was a nest of diminutive snakes, which did quite as much mischief as one great one. I But nothing seemed to please Roderick better, than to lay hold of a person infected with jealousy, which he represented as an enormous green reptile, with an ice-cold length of body, and the sharpest sting of any snake save one. I \"And what one is that?\" asked a bystander, overhearing him. I It was a dark\u00ad brewed man, who put tlie question; he had an evasive eye I I \"Why need you ask?\" replied Roderick, with a look of dark intelligence. \"Look into your own breast! Hark, my serpent be\u00ad stirs himself! He acknowledges the presence of a master-fiend!\" [I.e., a super-author.] I And then, as the bystanders afterwards affirmed, a hissing sound was heard, apparently in Roderick Elliston's breast. It was said, too, that an answering hiss came from the vitals of the shipmaster, as if a snake were actually [actively] lurking there, and had been aroused by the call of its brother-reptile. If there were in fact any such sound, it might have been caused by a malicious exercise of ventriloquism, on the part of Roderick. I Thus, making his own actual serpent--if a serpent there actually was in his bosom--the type of each man's fatal error, or hoarded sin, or unquiet conscience, and striking his sting so unremorsefully into the sorest spot, we may well imagine that Roderick became the pest of the city. Strange spectacle in human life, where it is the instinctive effort of one and all to hide those sad realities, and leave them undisturbed beneath a heap of superficial topics, which constitute the mate\u00ad rials of intercourse between man and man! It was not to be toler\u00ad ated that Roderick Elliston should break through the tacit compact, by which the world has done its best to secure repose, without relinquishing evil. The victims of his malicious remarks, it is true, had brothers [branches] enough to keep them in countenance [both uplifted and masked]; for, by Roderick's theory, every 228 mortal bosom harbored either a brood of small serpents, or one overgrown monster, that had devoured all the rest. (Hawthorne, \"Egotism; or, The Bosom Among the beggars here [at 'Viterbo'], the loudest and most vociferous was a crippled postillion, wearing his uniform jacket, green faced with red [cf. scarlet hue of ripe haw-apple]; and he seemed to consider himself entitled still\u00b7to get his living from travellers, as having been disabled in the way of his profession. Nothing can be more earnest than their ['the beggars(')'] entreaties for aid; nothing seemingly more genuine than their gratitude when they receive it. They return you the value of your alms in prayers (which, I sus\u00ad pect, the Italians have generally a notion of purchasing, when they assist the poor) and say, 'God will accompany you.' Many of them have a professional whine, and a certain doleful twist of the neck and turn of the head [=serpentine throat-gesture], which hardens [stones] my heart [haw] against them at once [--'(t)o beggars I give very little ']. A painter might find \u00b7 numerous models among them, if canvas had not already been more than sufficiently covered with their style of the picturesque.

It is certainly a useful shrub, forming beautiful fences, and contributing much to the garden-like appearance of England. To the English it may well counterbalance the myrtle of more genial climes [i.e., lovingly reciprocate with]. To the people of this section of the United States, it can never become of much importance. Here there is [long-ng] abundance of stone[-n]; and, while such an indestructible [i.e., responsive if unsympathetic] material can be found, live fences ought not to be adopted. A live [wood-serpentine] fence has certainly a tendency to beautify the scenery, and to give a garden\u00ad like aspect to the land it encloses [or restricts]; but it cannot compare in point of [raised lingual] utility with a firm stone[-n] 229 wall[-1]. When a hedge becomes gapped, it requires years [in yarning-weaving] to repair it; but, if a stone wall falls down, it is very soon replaced [i.e., as essential~ chthonic g-ground]. Live fences, however [deeper haw-over], may be used to advantage where stone is not to be found. Sometimes they may be introduced as ornaments [ear-wringing names], with very good effect. I There is a native shrub, abundant in this vicinity, most admirably adapted for fences,--the common cockspur-thorn (Crataegus Crus ~alli). In all the essentials [and creative essences] of a fencing shrub it fully equals [--and may be quired, woven with--] the English hawthorn, to which, indeed, it is closely allied. The spines [organic points] of this shrub are more than an inch long; so that a hedge formed of it would present an almost [i.e., not totally] impregnable barrier; bidding [well-pointed] defiance to all intruders, whether biped or quadruped. Several plants of this shrub have been suffered to stand [perhaps in lingual-phallic longing] near the [you-wreath: urethra-like] entrance of the Forest-river road, till they have assumed the size of trees. In the [buoyant] spring, they are [and were] covered with a profusion of white [seminal] blossoms; and, in the [mature, heavy] fall, their rich scarlet fruit [a scattering of ovules] never [yet ever] fails to attract attention [i.e., in painfully small glimpses]. In these particulars [these your-part-ticklers], this shrub strikingly resembles [re-assembles] its English congener. Indeed, the points of resemblance [the consonants of re-assembly] are so striking that it ought to be called the American hawthorn [i.e., adored, adorned-\u00ad with the recognition that the shrub privately New England 'Can haw!' (cut down)]. Like the English haw, its fruit requires two years [two yarning ears] to vegetate. I I We have growing among us one of the neatest little garden hedge-plants that the earth produces, the little privet (Ligustrum). It is found abundantly on the road to Manchester [i.e., man's-chest-]. It is of beautiful foliage, and in summer produces spikes [cf. spines] of sweet\u00ad smelling flowers, like miniature bunches of white lilac [cf. plumes of breath-vapor].' In the days of Parkinson and Evelyn, this shrub used to be clipped [cf. circumcised for El] into the forms of birds, beasts, and fishes, and nobody knows what [i.e., perhaps into brazenly-all-wise serpents]. Time, however [haw-over], has not diminished the estimate in which it is held [i.e., in Nat-han(d)-1]. I have often observed it [--around n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-served it--] forming the [haw-haw!-]hedges within the iron railings [rattler\u00ad call-links] that surround the public gardens in the great squares of London. For the formation of the interior [cf. onanistic ligule-throat] or garden hedges, there are few shrubs that approach it [or its name] in appearance of neatness and beauty. I We have plants all around us of singular [i.e., of serpentine marital] habits and strange propensities. I The [throat-K-]Cuscuta, or Dodder, which is found in the moist land of this neighborhood [i.e., boring under Naja Hannah's hood], affords a specimen of the 230 parasitic tribe of plants~ which fasten and feed upon others. The Cuscuta is a bright yellow [high-yelling] leafless vine, bearing a profusion of small white [seminal] flowers. It rises from the ground like any other vegetable [or serpent]; and, after attaining a certain height~ it looks around, and seizes\u00b7 upon the first plant that comes in its way [i.e., perhaps a hawthorn]. Like a little vegetable boa constrictor, it takes a few spiral.turns.round its victim; and, when it finds itself firmly fixed, it disengages itself from its own root, lets go its hold upon the earth, and depends for the future on the plant upon which it is {suggestively] seated [cf. the fleshly-lingual author, suggestively seated within his botanical realm of tight-lips--dependent upon the economies of shadowy metaphor, book-making, and greening sales]. In this way it blooms and perfects its seed, without any direct communication with the earth [i.e., but perhaps with Heaven--via its orifice-ear to its own unfolding nature, its special providence]. If the seeds [cf. sound-elements] of this plant are sown [--C'slkiss], they will come up and grow for a season; but they soon die [--D'dlturn], if they have no plant [i.e., as though no nurturing woman-organ, or full-Maw] to which they can attach themselves. Pope, in his \"Essay on Man,\" says:--I \"That thus to man the voice of Nature spake:-- I Go, from the creatures thy instruction take; I \" I Who knows but man caught the idea of multiplying choice fruits [and juicy, round literary haws] from observing with what facility parasitic plants attach themselves to others, and draw nourishment from roots that are not their own? I The [bell-mouthed] dog's\u00ad bane that is found all around us, the silk-weed that grows by the way-side, and the sundew that is found in every old peat meadow, are all strongly sensitive, and strangely destructive of insect life [i.e., prophylactic and reinforcing of insidious, incestuous oral life]. I The dog's-bane opens its nipper-like filaments; and when a fly puts in his proboscis in search of honey, they close like a steel trap [cf. constrictor's jaws], and the [embryo-like] little victim remains a provision [-yel(l) hau(l)-] till he dies. I I Some of our most common plants are remarkable in the choice of their localities [i.e., in loci of ultimate serpentine refuge]. under\u00ad dog's in the ruin and desola\u00ad tion of cities. Wherever there is a deserted mansion, with its garden in ruins [i.e., the magic-literal abode of the patronymic hawthorn--in runes], there is sure to be found the fatal hemlock [with H'el-key], as if the very ground were accursed [-el cursed], and brought forth poisonous plants. [mouth\u00ad line] stalks [malignly talks] over worn-out [and phallic-lingual abuse]. The black nightshade [dark N-palate] and deeply meaningful scrotal-laryngeal] form of the thorn-apple [horn-Haw!-apple] rise from neglected heaps noxious exhalations [of the anal en(d)trail] had assumed a material [serpentine-scroll] 231 form, to warn man of the consequences of uncleanness.

[A] t his bosom, he felt the sickening motion of a thing alive, and the gnawing [nauseous heaving] of that restless fang [Angangsbuchstabe H-], which seemed to gratify at once a physical appetite and a fiendish spite. I I Often, it pleased the unfortunate young man to vex [haw-w-hex] people with a light[] satire, . still characterized by somewhat of snake-like virulence. One day, he [k-]encountered [--to assimilate--] an ambitious statesman, and gravely inquired after the welfare of his boa constrictor; for of that species, Roderick affirmed, this gentleman's serpent must needs be, since its appetite was enormous enough to devour the [h'~] whole [K'K'] country and constitution. At another time, he stopped [--to scratch off--] a close-fisted fellow of great wealth, but who skulked about the city, in the guise of a scare-crow, with a patched blue surtout, brown hat, and mouldy boots, scraping pence together, and picking up rusty nails [cf. thorns, pins]. Pretend\u00ad ing to look earnestly at this respectable person's stomach, Roderick assured him that his snake was a [K'H'] copperhead, and had been generated by the immense [KW'] quantities of that base metal [earth's orofacially expelled womb-menstruum, reddish in hue], [W'W'] with which he daily defied his fingers. Again, he assaulted [--to sting--] a man of rubicund visage [very red in hue], and told him that few bosom-serpents had more devil in them, than those that breed in the [W = V'V:A'] vats of a [Bee-havlve! tooth-envenomed] distillery. The next whom Roderick honored [--to vine-hop upon--] with his attention was a distinguished clergyman, who happened just then to be engaged in a theological controversy, where human wrath was more perceptible than divine inspiration [i.e., reddish~purple 232 (W:..W,ruNG)-to-throat strangulation]. I \"You have swallowed a snake, in a cup of sacramental wine,\" quoth he. I \"Profane wretch!\" exclaimed the divine; but nevertheless, his hand stole to his breast [i.e., in low-to-high (and left-to-right) mega\u00ad gestural (mirror) acknowledgement--of author's binary name.] I .... I ....... [T]he city could not bear [i.e., neither conjoin with nor gestate] this new apostle. It was demanded by nearly all, and particularly by the most respectable [table-talking and tabling] inhabitants, that Roderick should no longer be permitted to violate the received rules of decorum, by obtruding his own bosom-serpent [his hop-vine of wizening hopes] to the public gaze, and dragging those of decent people from their lurking places. I Accordingly, his relatives interfered, and placed him in a private asylum for the insane. .... I In solitude, his melancholy [melic char] grew more black and sullen [i.e., he secreted a greater volume of grapheme\u00ad attuned literary manuscript]. He spent whole days--indeed, it was his sole occupation--in communing with the serpent. A conversation [solo duet-duel] was sustained, in which as it seemed, the hidden monster bore [generated] a[-n other] part, though unintelligibly to the listeners, and inaudible, except in a hiss [cf. friction of writing-tip, in counterchant with writhing tongue-tip]. Singu\u00ad lar as it may appear, the sufferer qad now contracted a sort of affection for his tormentor; mingled, however, with the intensest loathing and horror. Nor were such discordant emotions incompat\u00ad ible; each, on the contrary, imparted strength and poignancy to its opposite. Horrible love--horrible antipathy--embracing one another in his bosom, and both concentrating themselves upon a being that had crept into his vitals, or been engendered there, and which was nourished with his food, and lived upon his life, and was as intimate with him as his own heart [i.e., with its God-yell-in-egged-Haw-], and yet was the hawker] of a literature of adulterated signature-morphology.] But not the less was it the true type of a morbid nature. I Sometimes, in his moments of rage and bitter hatred against the snake and himself, Roderick determined to be the death of him, even at the expense of his own life. Once he attempted it by starvation. But, while the wretched man was on the point of famishing, the monster seemed to feed upon his heart [haw], and to thrive and wax gamesome [i.e., play well-polished wood-games], as if it were his sweetest and most congenial diet. Then he privily took a dose of active poison, imagining that it would not fail to kill either himself, or the devil that possessed him, or both together. Another mistake; for if Roderick had not yet been destroyed by his own poisoned heart [haw], nor the snake gnawing it [gnostically knowing it], they had little to fear from arsenic or corrosive sublimate [i.e., from further refinements of sense]. Indeed, the venomous pest appeared to operate as an antidote against all other 233 poisons [i.e.~ it maintained its formal integrity, poise]. The physicians tried to suffocate the fiend with tobacco-smoke. He breathed it as freely as if it were his native atmosphere. Again, they drugged their patient with opium, and drenched him with intoxicating liquors, hoping that the snake might thus be reduced to stupor, and perhaps be ejected [hopped] from the stomach. they succeeded in rendering [rending] Roderick insensible [i.e., into meaninglessness--as mere serpentine-agent]; but, placing their hands upon.his breast, they were inexpressibly horror-stricken to feel the monster wriggling, twining, and darting to and fro, within his narrow [his signatural venous-lingual] limits, evidently enlivened by the opium or alcohol, and incited to unusual feats of activity [i.e., sporting its\u00b7 creative-heuristic powers of intact verbal contects]. Thenceforth, they gave up all attempts at cure or palliation. The doomed sufferer submitted to his fate [i.e., . to the author's special providence and province of name], resumed his former loathsome affection for the bosom-fiend, and spent whole miserable days before a looking glass [quicksilvered rhetorical conceptacle], with his mouth [his whole red haw\u00ad chamber] wide open, watching, in hope and horror, to catch a glimpse1 [a glance--of glands of glans--] of the head [of his own life], far down within his throat. I (Hawthorne, \"Egotism; or, The Bosom Serpent' [1843], the reader-- whom I cannot help considering as my guest in the old Manse, and entitled to all courtesy in the way of sight-showing--perhaps he will choose to take a nearer view.... I I Come; we have pursued a somewhat devious track.... I I Childless men, if they would know something of the bliss of paternity, should plant a seed--be it squash, bean, Indian corn, or perhaps a mere flower, or worthless weed--should plant it with their own hands, and nurse it from infancy to maturity, altogether by their own care. If there be not too many of them, each individual plant becomes an object of separate interest. My garden, that skirted [hem-hawed] the avenue of the Manse, was of precisely the right extent [with phallic-lingual reach]. An hour or two of morning labor was all that it required. But I used to visit and re-visit it, a dozen times a day, and stand in deep contemplation over my vegetable progeny, with a love that nobody could share or conceive of, who had never taken part in the process of creation. It was one of the most bewitching sights in the world, to observe a hill of beans thrusting aside the soil, or a [signatural-urethral] row of early peas, just peeping forth sufficiently to trace a line of delicate green. Later in the season, the humming-birds were attracted by the blossoms of a peculiar variety of bean; and they were a joy to me, those little 234 spiritual visitants, for deigning to sip airy food out of my [pregenital hic-cups--in salivary glands, taste buds, and lips]. Multitudes of bees used to bury themselves in the - yellow [low-(bladder-)yelling] blossoms of the summer-squashes. This, too, was a deep satisfaction; although, when they had laden themselves with sweets, they flew away to some unknown hive, which would give back nothing in requital of what my garden had contributed [cf. reader as unrewarding purchaser]. But I was glad thus to fling [cf. spit} a benefaction upon the passing breeze, with the certainty that somebody must profit by it, and that there would be a. little more honey in the world, to allay the sourness and bitterness which mankind is always complaining of [i.e., perhaps in author's own works]. Yes, indeed; my life was the sweeter for that honey [i.e., not for critics' responses]. 1 Speaking of summer-squashes, I must say a word of their beau\u00ad tiful and varied forms [a well-rounded yet viny word, of 'an Oriental character,' on pregnant reciprocators]. They presented an endless diversity of urns and vases, shallow or deep, scalloped or plain, moulded in patterns which a sculptor would do well to copy, since Art has never invented anything more graceful. A hundred squashes in the garden were worthy--in my [round] eyes, at least--of being rendered indestructible in marble. If ever Providence (but I know it never will) should assign me a super\u00ad fluity of gold, part of it shall be expended for a service of plate [cf. soft-and-hard palate], or most delicate porcelain [cf. dental enamel], to be wrought into the [smiling shapes of summer\u00ad squashes, gathered from vines which I will plant with my own hands. As dishes for containing vegetables, they would be peculiarly appropriate. I But, not merely the squeamish love of the Beautiful was gratified by my toil in the kitchen-garden. There was a hearty [throat-plunge-directed] enjoyment, likewise, in observing the growth of the crook-necked winter squashes, from the first little bulb, with the withered blossom adhering to it, until they lay strewn upon the soil, big, round fellows, hiding their heads beneath the [labial, vulvar] leaves, but turning up their great yellow rotundities to the noontide sun. Gazing at them, I felt that, by my agency, something worth living for had been done. A new substance was borne into the world. They were real and tangible existences, which the mind could seize hold of and rejoice in. A cabbage, too--especially the early Dutch cab\u00ad bage, which swells to a monstrous circumference, until its ambitious heart [haw] often bursts asunder,--is a matter to be proud of, when we can claim a share with the earth and sky [with the universal mould] in producing it. But, after all, the hugest pleasure [the greatest human universal] is reserved, until these vegetable children of ours [i.e., author's and reader's] are smoking on the table, and we, like Saturn, make a meal of them. I What with the river, the battle-field, the orchard, and the garden, the reader begins to despair of finding his way back into 235 the old Manse [cf. the old Maw]. I I But to return from this digression. A part of my ['priestly'] predecessor's library was stored in the garret; no unfit receptacle, indeed, for such dreary trash as comprised the greater number of volumes. Autographs of famous names were to be seen, in faded ink, on some of their fly-leaves; and there were marginal observations, or interpolated pages closely covered with manu'script, in illegible short-hand [sh!-hand-yell], perhaps concealing mat.ter of profound truth and wisdom. The world will never be the better for it . [I =High-grade anal reduetion. Cf. Rev. Ashley voice that rewinds, re-minds.] (Hawthorne, \"The Old Manse: The Author Makes the Reader Acquainted with His Abode,\" Mosses from an Old five:] I could not quite believe that I was not to find the Venus de Medici; and still, as I passed from one room to another, my breath rose and fell a little, with the half-hope, half-fear, that she might stand before me. Really, I did not know that I cared so much about Venus, or any possible woman of marble. At last I caught a glimpse of her, through the door of the next room [annexed haw for rumination]. It isthe best room of the whole [serpentine] series, octagonal in shape, and hung with red damask; and the light comes down from a row of windows passing quite round, beneath the octagonal dome. The Venus stands somewhat aside from the centre of the room [=eccentric interest], and is surrounded by an iron-railing, a pace or two from her pedestal in front, and less behind [=eccentrically hem-hedged, as though yolk in ovarian shell]. I think she might safely be left to the reverence her womanhood would win, without any other protection. She is very beautiful; very satisfactory; and has a fresh and new charm about her . The hue of the marble is just so much mellowed by time as to do for her all that Gibson tries, or ought, to try, to do for his statues by color; softening her, warming her almost imperceptibly, making her an inmate of the heart as well as a spiritual existence (haw+ (y)el =glans]. I felt a kind of tenderness for her; an affection, not as if she were one woman, but all womankind in one. Her modest attitude ... is partly what unmakes her as the heathen goddess, and softens her into a woman. There is a slight degree of alarm, too, in her face \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 I may as well stop here. It is of no use to throw heaps of words upon her; for they all fall away, and leave (un-leave] her standing in chaste and naked grace, as untouched as when I began. [i.e., my venerating, able venereal wandering of self-regeneration]. I The poor little woman has suffered terribly by the mishaps of her long existence in marble [her ecstasy of immortal self-presen\u00ad tation]. Each of her legs has been broken into two or three fragments; her arms have been broken off; her body has been broken 236 quite across at the waist; her head has been snapt off at the neck[=signature-decapitation]. Furthermore, there have been grievous wounds and losses of substance ln various tender parts of her body. But, partly by the skill with which the statue has been restored, and partly because the idea is perfect and indestructible, all these injuri~s [thornings, engravings] do not in the least impair the effect, everi when you see [seams] where the dissevered fragments have been re-united. She is just as [genitally] whole as when she left the hands of the sculptor. I am glad to have seen this Venus, and to have found her so tender and so chaste. On the wall of the room, and to be taken in at the same glance is a painted Venus by Titian, reclining on a couch, naked and lustful. I The room of the Venus seems to be the treasure place of \u00b7the whole Uffizzi palace, containing more pictures by famous masters [--i.e., universal visual symbols (esp. as plane-to-sphere, leaf-to-fruit vulviform perceptual-process referents)--] than are to be found in all the rest of the gallery. There were several by Raphael, and the room was crowded with the easels \u00b7of artists. I did not look half enough at anything [hem(i)\u00ad hawed], but merely took a preliminary taste [tip-sip], as a prophecy of the enjoyment [enjoining, unjoining] to come. I I The Venus de Medici has a dimple [cf. concave pimple] on her chin. I .... (/ And:] I paid another visit to bhe Uffizzi gallery, this morning I mean no disrespect to Gibson, or Powers, or a hundred other men who people the world with nudities, all of which are abortive as compared with her I observed to day (what my wife [and reproductive partner] has already remarked) that the eyes of the statue are slightly hollowed out, in a [peck-]peculiar way, so as to give them a look of depth and intelligence [=heuristic mirror of empty scrotal balls-- concave hemi-shields of Easter-Ei!] She is a [phallic-resurrective] miracle. The sculptor must have [gush-]wrought religiously, and have felt that something far beyond his own skill was working through his hand. , [T]he contemplation of the statue will refine and elevate my taste . If, at any time, I become less sensible of it, it will be my deterioration .. [I Cf. egg and dart (or anchor, or tongue) in ovalo--i.e., as ornamentation in hollow relief (architecture, furniture-making).] (Hawthorne, The French and Italian Notebooks [Florence, [dull-liver], extreme antiquity, was aroused rather prema\u00ad turely, one summer morning, by the shouts of the child Pansie, in an adjoining [serpent-linked] chamber .. The old gentleman woke With more than his customary alacrity, and, after taking a moment 237 to gather his wits about him, pulled aside the faded moreen curtains of his ancient bed, and thrust his head into a beam of sunshine that caused him to wink and withdrawn it again. I I The object which most helped to bring Dr. Dolliver completely to his waking perceptions was one that common observers might suppose to have been snatched bodily out of his dreams [cf. literary reveries, pensees]. The same sunbeam that had dazzled the doctor between the bed-curtains [cf. soft folds of mouth], glimmered on the weather-beaten gilding which had once adorned this mysterious symbol, and showed it to be an enormous serpent, twining round a wooden post, and reaching [as though chthonic tongue] quite from the floor of the chamber to its ceiling. I It was evidently a thing that [boa-constrictor-like:] could[-]boast[-]of[-]considerable antiquity, the dry-rot having eaten out its eyes and gnawed away the tip of its tail; and it must have stood long exposed to the atmosphere, for a kind of grey [cf. haw-blue] moss had partially overspread its tarnished [cf. yel-low] gilt surface, and a [throat\u00ad countering] swallow, or other familiar little [natal] bird, in some by-gone summer, seemed to have built its nest [i.e., of wood\u00ad weavings] in the yawning and exaggerated [--i.e., Haw!-gesturing--] mouth. Not to make a further mystery about a very simple matter, this bedimmed and rotten reptile [and one 'further' sug\u00ad gestive of the human pharynx] was once the medical emblem or apothecary's sign of the famous Dr. Swinnerton, who practiced physic in the earlier days in New England, when a head of Aescu\u00ad lapius or Hippocrates, would have vexed the souls of the righteous as savoring of Heathendom. The ancient dispenser of drugs had therefore set up an image of the Brazen Serpent, and followed his business for many years, with great credit, under this Scriptural [and literary] device; and Dr. Dolliver, being the apprentice, pupil, and humble friend of the learned Swinnerton's old age, had inherit~d the symbolic snake, and much other valuable [snake\u00ad linked] property [chthonic anatomy] by his bequest. I While the patriarch was putting on his small-clothes, he took care to stand in the parallelogram [cf.(S-)crypt-telegram] of [Signature-re\u00ad designing] sunshine that fell upon the uncarpeted [chthonic] floor. The summer warmth was very genial to his [cold, wood-reptilian] system and yet made him shiver; his wintry veins rejoiced at it, though the reviving blood tingled through them with a half-painful and only half-pleasurable titillation. Yesterday, in the chill of his forlorn old age, the doctor expected soon to stretch out his weary bones among that quiet community [of the 'burial ground on the corner of which he dwelt. There lay many an old acquaintance, who had gone to sleep with the flavor of Dr. Dolli\u00ad ver's tinctures and powders upon his [I]n\u00ad deed, .. he dreamily mixed the infirmities of his present condition with the repose of the approaching one, being haunted by a notion that the damp earth, under the grass and dandelions, must needs be pernicious for his cough [in throat] and his 238 rheumatism [in 'rusty joints' and limbs]. But, this morning, the cheerful sunbeams, or the mere taste of his grandson's cordial [cord-yell] that he had taken at bedtime, or the fitful vigor [authorial turn-of-haw] that often sports irreverently with aged people, had caused an unfrozen drop of youthfulness, somewhere \\Jithin him, to expand.

Immediately below (in the chapter development, Part B) begins the prime, literary unfolding of the signature-petitions--for the ever well-warded and singularly self-salvific thorn-apple, ever serpent-intoned literary world. 243 B. Development: A Literary Unfolding of the Signature-Petitions for the Thorn-Apple of World. B.l. A Literary Unfolding of the First Petition: The Hawthornesque of MUM-YAWN. The literary unfolding of the first petition draws from twenty works by Hawthorne--eighteen tales, one novel (The Marble Faun), and one unfinished work (The Ancestral Footstep). The talley of titles (l.a)--a figure-rhymed fifth-stave of the total of one hundred and three titles--functions as a proportionate, investigative classifica\u00ad tion of texts which are sufficiently name-ritualized to admit of study at step though other classification is possible, serves to foreground the consonant-figure as a movement from word-initial alliterative m to word-medial singular ~'and provides (parenthetically) step-relevant, figure-reinforcing memos on the persistence of the idea of name in the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, on the idea of name chiefly as American sociolingual memorial, as night-black graphologic attribute of pro\u00ad fessional identity, and as lexical riddle capable of attaining long\u00ad anecdote, national-yarn dimensions. The four-fold sampling (l.b-e) of twenty representative long passages from nine of the twenty works tallied (fourteen passages from seven tales, five passages from novel, and one passage from unfinished work) serves to give extension to the idea of nominal riddle as long-anecdote, as text in which etymologic and privi-semantic (speech-serpent) values of name-fragments, extending 244 themselves most recognizably by means of the consonant joints of discourse, serve to give pattern to a ground-upJ process of reference to the organs of speech in narrative observation (esp. in 1. b--a point-mark of organ-song), to a wood-cleav~! process of reference to phallic interaction in agent discourse (esp. in l.c--a leaf-fold of breach-counterchant), to a box-round! process of reference to a hawf- glan(d)s!-anchored haw in scenarios of climax and catastrophe (esp. in l.d--a skullcap of world-hymn), and to a touch-stone! process of reference to relics of tongue-memory in tracts of apologia upon implicit in-composition rebirth (esp. in l.e--a spine trail of necro- elegy). Petitionally sub-tagged as \"mumtown\" the for palate-dark as \"counteryaw\" (cf. the of Yahweh-cued organ-breath- \u00b7 space excitement), as \"cryptiglance\" (cf. the critical motive of eye- caught super-inferior oro-en[d]-trail content), and as \"Americ'nGro'link\" (cf. the anthem of self-understood long-dark literary-thorning)--the four-fold sampling of twenty representative long passages (five pas- sages per sub-tag) unfolds the self-conscious, mouth-conscious epic self-utterance of the name \"Nathaniel Hawthorne,\" as Hebraic-Anglic identity forever lost to America, yet forever hemming and hawing in literary-referential courtship, round about the fated geographic muse-- round the native land, round America, round the representative American lady. The necessary courtship of American contexts specifically motivates--and the ironic winning of substantial American echoes specifically answers to--the first petition.

B.2. A Literary Unfolding of the Second Petition: The Hawthornesque of RIC-GOUGE. The literary unfolding of the second petition draws from twenty- one works by Hawthorne--nineteen tales, one novel (The House of the Seven Gables), and one unfinished work (Etherege). The talley of titles (2.a)--a figure-rhymed fifth-stave of the total of one hundred and three titles--functions as a proportionate, investigative classification of texts which are sufficiently name-ritualized to admit of study at step though other classification is possible, serves to foreground the consonant-figure as a movement from word-initial alliterative h to word-initial alliterative ~\u00b7 and provides (parenthetically) step\u00ad relevant, figure-reinforcing memos on the persistence of the idea of 288 name in the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, on the idea of name chiefly as American sociolingual memorial, as grave-dark graphologic attribute of professional identity, and as lexical riddle capable of attaining long-anecdote national-yam dimensions. The four-fold sampling (2.b-e) of twenty representative long passages from eight of the twenty-one works tallied (nine passages from six tales, nine passages from novel, and two passages from unfinished work) serves to give extension to the idea of nominal riddle as long-anecdote, as text in which etymologic and privi-semantic (speech-serpent) values of name-fragments, extend\u00ad ing themselves most recognizably by means of the consonant joints of discourse, serve to give pattern to a ground-up! process of reference to the organs of speech in narrative observation (esp. in 2.b--a point-mark of organ-song), to a wood-cleave! process of reference to phallic interaction in agent discourse (esp. in 2.c--a leaf-fold of breach-counterchant), to a iox(up)-round! process of reference to a hawk-glan(d)s!-anchored haw in scenarios of climax and catastrophe (esp. in 2.d--a skullcap of world-hymn), and to a touch-stone! process of reference to relics of tongue-memory in tracts of apologia upon implicit in-composition rebirth (esp. in 2.e--a spine trail of necro\u00ad elegy). Petitionally sub-tagged as \"truncgush\" (cf. the enigmatic motive of voice-and-tongue-root cracking of throat bournes), as \" counterhedge\" (cf. the empathic motive of high-ridge reaching excitement of organ-space), as \"hob(p)glance\" (cf. the critical motive of eye-caught super-ordinary han[d]-[t]horn-held content), and as \"priv'burs'link\" (cf. rebanding 289 of all essence-precious self-crow spines)--the four-fold sampling of rwenty representative long passages (five passages per sub-tag) unfolds the self-conscious, mouth-conscious epic self-utterance of the name \"Nathaniel hawthorne,\" as Hebraic-Anglic ident.ity forever lost to fortune, yet forever gold-gagging upon and retching-yellow over in the literary-referential gouging of a mysterious hereditary capital--a centrally-accented stock of family fortune, connected with powers of curse, and which magically handled, returns as the American's fortune (inclusive of lady) privately possessed. The necessary reinvestment of accursed-gold specifically motivates--and the ironic winning of substantial coffer-echoes specifically answers to--the second petition.

A Literary Unfolding of the Third Petition: The Hawthornesque of DART-STICK(S). The literary unfolding of the third petition draws from twenty-one. works by Hawthorne--nineteen tales, one novel (The Scarlet Letter), and \u00b7 one unfinished work (The Dolliver Romance). The talley of titles (3.a) -a figure-rhymed fifth-stave of the total of one hundred and three titles--functions as a proportionate, investigative classification of texts which are sufficiently name-ritualized to admit of study at step though other classification is possible, serves to foreground the consonant-figure as a movement from word-initial and word-medially/ terminally repeated E to word-initial singular ~. and provides (parenthet\u00ad ically) step-relevant, figure-reinforcing memos on ~he persistence of the idea of name in the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, on the idea of name chiefly as American sociolingual memorial, as grave-dark graphologic attribute of professional identity, and as lexical riddle capable of attaining long-anecdote, national-yam dimensions. The four-fold sampling (3. b-e) of twenty representative long passages from six of the twenty-one works tallied (seven passages from four tales, seven passages from novel, and two passages from unfinished work) serves to give extension to the idea of nominal riddle as long-anecdote, as text in which etymologic and privi-semantic (speech-serpent) values of name\u00ad fragments, extending themselves most recognizably by means of.the consonant joints of discourse, serve to give pattern to a ground-up! process of reference to the organs of speech in narrative observation (esp. in 3. b--a point-mark of organ-song), to a wood-cleave! process of 328 reference to phallic interaction in agent discourse (esp. in 3.c--a leaf-fold of breach-counterchant), to a box-ro[~]nd! process of reference to a hawk-glan(d)s!-anch[w]red haw in scenarios of climax and catastrophe (eSP in 3.d--a skullcap of world-hymn), and to a touch-stone! process of reference to relics of tongue memory in tracts of apologia upon implicit in-composition rebirth (esp. in 3.e--a spine trail of necro-elegy). Petitionally sub-tagged as \"tonguerove\" (cf. enigmatic motive woad-fork-extending tongue bournes), as \"counterstichs\" (cf. the empathic motive of tooth-sharply straining heart's-core-impulses), as \"woveglance\" (cf. the critical motive content) , and of self-understood restocking of the raving-red r[:]ho-joint)--the four-fold sampling of twenty representative long passages (five passages per sub-tag) unfolds the self-conscious, mouth-conscious epic self-utterance of the name \"Nathaniel Hawthorne,\" as Hebraic-Anglic identity forever face-lost to public witness, yet forever snake-rend'ing and reweaving, a botanical map-and-mask of soft-curtain and wood-hood enfolding, a glan(d)s-magical public child.

So magnificent was the small [fang-in-lip-]figure, when thus arrayed, and such was the splendor of Pearl's own proper beauty, shining through the [gorge-]gorgeous[-arched-]robes which might have extinguished a [face-]paler loveliness, that there was an absolute [oro-]circle of radiance around her, on the [signature-]darksome [haw!-]cottage-floor [=shadow of N-palate].

But that perversity, which all children have more or less of, and of which little Pearl had a tenfold[:RHO-fold] por[e-]tion, now, at the most inopportune moment [of cathetical examination], took possession of her, and [closet-roundly] closed her lips, or impelled her to speak words amiss.

There was [throat-]fire in her and throughout her; she see[--Y-]med the unpremeditated offshoot of a passionate moment. Her mother, in contriving her [~oft-palate-]garb, had allowed the [i~~e-li~~eou~ [ankh-]tendencies of her imagination their full play; arraying her in a crimson velvet tunic, of a peculiar [hedge-]cut, abundantly embroidered with fantasies and flourishes of [yel!-]gold thread. So much strength of coloring, which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of a fainter bloom, was admirably adapted to Pearl's beauty, and made her the very brightest [yellhaw!-scarlet-]jet of flame that ever [palate-]danced upon the earth. I But it was a remark[']able attribute of this garb, and, indeed of the child's whole[:haw]_ appearance, that it irresistibly and inevitably reminded the beholder of the token which Hester Prynne was ~me~ lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity, to create an analogy between the object of her affection, and the emblem of her guilt and torture.

I I Before\u00b7 the minister had time to celebrate his [y-]victory over this last ['third'] temptation, he was conscious oi another impulse,. more ludicrous, and almost as [h~ar!-]horrihle. It was,-we blush to tell it,--it was to stop short in the road, and teach some very wicked words to a [k+]not of little Puritan children who were playing there, and had just begun to talk. Denying himself this [F/fang-]freak, as unworthy of his cloth, he met a drunken sea[-eeiY-]man, one of the ship's crew from the Spanish Main.

But the course of her unearthly eloquen e soon led her to the persecutions of her sect[s-c't], and from thence the step was short to her own peculiar sorrows.

A Literary Unfolding of the Fourth Petition: The Hawthornes4ue of SIP-SQUISH. The literary unfolding of the fourth petition draws from twenty-one works by Hawthorne--eighteen tales, one novel (Fanshawe}, and two unfinished works (Septtmius Norton and Septimius Felton}., The talley of titles (4.a}--a figure-rhymed fifth-stave of the total of one hundred and three titles--functions as proportionate, investigative classification of texts which are sufficiently name-ritualized to admit of study at step though other class:tfication is possible, serves to foreground the consonant-figure as a movement from word-initial alliterative (t}~ to v word-medial singular (d}z, and provides (parenthetically) step-relevant, figure-reinforcing memos on the persistence of the idea of name in the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, on the idea of name chiefly as American sociolingual memorial, as grave-dark graphologic attribute of profes- sional identity, and as lexical riddle capable of attaining long-anecdote, national-yam dimensions. The four-fold sampling (4.b-e) of twenty representative long passages from nine of the twenty-one works tallied (thirteen passages from six tales, four p~ssages from novel, and three passages from unfinished works) serves to give extension to the idea of nominal riddle as long-anecdote, as text in which etymologic and privi-symbolic (speech-serpent} values of name fragments, extending themselves most recognizably by means of the consonant joints of ~. ' 380 discourse, serve to give pattern to a ground-up! process of reference to . . . the organs of speech (esp. in 4.b--a point-mark of organ-song), to a wood-cleave! process of reference to phallic interaction in agent dialogue (esp. in 4.c--a leaf-fold\u00b7 of breach-counterchant), to a (sow)box-~ound! process of reference to a hawk-g!an(d)s!-;ong-ancho~ed haw in scenarios of climax and catastrophe (esp. in 4.d--a skullcap of world-hymn), and to a touch-stone! process of reference to relics of tongue-memory in tracts of apologia upon implicit in-composition rebirth (esp. in 4.e--a spine trail of necro-elegy).

If this be true, it is a fearful truth. I Let us illustrate the subject by an imaginary example. A venerable gentleman, one Mr. Smith, who had long been regarded as a pattern of moral excellence, was warming his aged blood with a glass or two of generous wine. His children being gone forth about their worldly business, and his grandchildren at school, he sat alone, in a deep, luxurious armchair' with hi! f,ut b,p~th a +i~ sa~ed old people have a dread of solitude, and when better company. may not be had, rejoice even to hear the quiet breathing of a babe, asleep upon the carpet.

Nevertheless, his thoughts will stray into the misty region of the past, and the old man be chill and sad. Wine will not always cheer him. Such might have been the case with Mr. Smith, when, [guUet-an!s!l!] How kind of Fancl, Memoq, and ~on!~en\u00a3e, to visit the old gentleman, just as he was beginning to imagine that the wine had neither so bright a sparkle, nor so excellent a flavor, as when himself and the li~o~ were less aged! Through the dim ien~t~ of gl!re o~ !unshine, a rich obscurity, the three guests drew nearthe silver-haired old man. Memory, with a finger between the leaves of her huge volume [cf. tongue-and-mouth-folds/ lips], placed herself her station on the elt, so as to be next to the heart [cf. throat]; while Fan~ set own her pictu~e-box upon the table, with the tear [slit w. expression of voice] would have washed away each hateful [wood\u00ad ]picture, and left. the canvass white as snow. But, Mr. Smith, at a [(!)gorn-]pr\u00a3~ of ~on!s\u00a3en~e and suddenly dis[-]covered that his three guests were gone.

The literary unfolding of the fifth petition draws from twenty works by \u00b7Hawthorne--eighteen tales, one novel (The Blithedale Romance), 425 and one unfinished work (Grimshawe). The talley of titles (S.a)--a figure-rhymed fifth-stave of the total of one hundred and three titles\u00ad functions as a proportionate, investigative classification of texts which are sufficiently name-ritualized to admit of study at step though other classification is possibl~, serves to foreground the consonant-figure as a movement from word-initial singular ~ to word-medial singular ~' and provides (parenthetically) step-relevant, figur_e-reinforcing memos on the persistence of the idea of name in the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, on the idea of name chiefly as American sociolingual memorial, as grave-dark graphologic attribute of professional identity, and as lexical riddle capable of attaining long-anecdote, national-yarn dtmensions. The four-fold sampling (S .. b-e} of twenty representative long passages from fourteen of the twenty works tallied (fourteen passsages from twelve tales, two passages from novel, and four passages from unfinished work) serves to give extension to the idea of nominal riddle as long-anecdote, as text in whic~ etymologic and privi-semantic (speech-serpent) values of name-fragments, extending themselves most recognizably by means of the consonant joints of discourse, serve to give pattern to a ground-up! process of reference to the organs of speech in narrative observation (esp. in S.b--a point-mark of organ-song), to a wood-cleave! process of reference to phallic interaction in agent discourse (esp. in S.c--a leaf-fold of breach-counterchant}, to a box(9ver)-round! process of reference to a hawk-g;an(d)s!-anchored haw in scenarios of climax and catastrophe (esp. in S.d--a skull-cap of world-hymn), and to a touch~ stone! process of reference to relics of tongue-memory in tracts of 426 apologia upon implicit in-composition rebirth (esp. in 5.e--a spine trail of necro-elegy).

It was impossible to feel easy and comfortable in contact with him; if you looked in his face, there was the red, lurid glare of his eY.es, meeting you fiercely and craftily as ever; sometimes he bit his lip; he frowned in an awful manner. Once he burst out into an awful fit of cursing, for no good reason Then, again--but this was only once--he heaved a deep, ponderous sigh, that seemed to come up in spite of him out his [haw-]depths, an exhalation of deep suffering, as if some convulsion had given it a passage to upper air, instead of its being hidden, as it generally was, by accumulated rubbish of later time heaped above it.

(End of B. Development: A Literary Unfolding of the Signature-Petitions for the Thorn-Apple of World.) 471 C. Conclusion: The Way to a Further Evaluation of Hawthorne's Oral-Gestural Scale of Ambush. In the foregoing, developmental part of this, the third chapter of the thesis, a successful application has aeen made to the literary works of Nathaniel Hawthorne of a five-step scale of consonant figures with oral-tags developed (in Chapter II) from Hawthorne's text of literary signatures in accord with Richard Paget's oral-gestural theory of consonant sounds. Guided by five key principles which reassert the self-investment of an ingrained serpentine master-form in hawthornian habitats and constructs of mind (a form first posited in Chapter I), that application has unfolded five five-fold signature petitions for a privy-symbolic, well-warded thorn-apple of world. Sampling broadly of scale-keyed passages from one hundred and three literary works by Hawthorne, that concordant unfolding of the signature-petitions for the draconic yet undersating all-round haw-in-mouth constitutes the systematic evidence of the higher,literary qualification of Hawthorne's signature\u00ad poetic, or of the anthemal burgeoning into significant literary existence or. enigmatic Yahweh's ever English Haw!-bearing-on (In nomine Patris ), ear-hegemonically ever crux-anchored in the prosperity of the United States of America, its historic gifts of (1) land, (2) capital, (3) population, (4) culture, and (5) language( et Spiritus Sancti), and sense-mystically ever heart-tempered by the magic, Renaissance Sun of Christ of the Epiphany--i.e., by \"That glorious Form ,\"of \"The Star-led join[t] [-]voice Choir[' d],\" secret Altar toucht with hallow'd fire[,]\" with \"Th'old Dragon under ground I In straiter limits bound,\" and \"So [th]en in bed, I Curtain'd with cloudy red, I Pillow[ing] his chin upon an orient wave \"--i.e., to show Incarnate self~reinvestment, to dis-spell midwiving forms, to to consclch-hear, embow, and self-reflectively succor and defend the Embryo of Hope to its End-of-World Perfection( ~ Filii ).

The assessment of the constraint of Hawthorne's signature-poetic upon interpretation, criticism, and scholarship--or voice in the context of literary recognition~ even when that context evidently blesses (e.g.~ Melville, as contemporary)--will be undertaken in the next, the evaluative fourth and final chapter of the thesis. The evaluation developed in that final fourth chapter should not exclude implications for general studies in literature, language, and aesthetic perception--three directions re-asserting themselves, at this point (cf. I.A), in consequence of the appropriation made (i.e., above in the conclusion) of John Milton. Undoubtedly a major figure of the English and the Renaissance-Latin literary traditions, and a pen-wielder strongly self-addressed to and redressive of the arts of oratory, and a classic visualizer as well of the \"pleasing\" motor-plastic '!redundan[cel\" of Eden's Master-Serpent, romancing \"erect I Amidst his circling Spires, on the grass\" in Paradise Lost, i.e., to begin \"with Serpent Tongue I Organic, or impulse of vocal Air\" the temptation of Eve (IX.SOl-3,529-30)--the Puritan Milton not only belongs to the linguistic-articulatory heritage of Paget, but may have contributed directly to the signatural motor-orality of Hawthorne: to emerge at the very least as a highly probable Romanic verbal-genetic aspect, British-American street, lunatically self-purifying, and dream-vocationally \"lip\"-oracular-i.e., for a thriftily robbing ~eri~a~-prov~cial \"Robi~,\" with an innate sense of optical-and-auricular turn and with \"oa~\"-\"~ud[-]gel\"-\"root,\" a , 475 substantial device near-etymo-symbolic, of the Old World epic literary culture, Insular and Continental (see again my B.l.a[~-01] and b.one-two, c-e.one--and cf.

But the full oro-morphological ripening of the name-play, i.e., to consummate private perfection (and inclusive perhaps of the steps-2;3 notion of lingual jack-in-the-pulpit as John-in-a-DunG[:d~]eon--cf. Do[-]no[t-]tell[-all], in my B.l.e.four, may have been apperceived by Hawthorne in the Nativity Ode--already cited above in the chapter conclusion, and ending with the two lines at once tongue-pacific and multivalently vulvi-dentate (i.e., with the 476 stephanian, world-figure), well-hedged at once to ~i:l:X~f. fish-~ti~-~n~ed f.O~ t!ht.e; and see again the nasal-blood-stream-and-1e~et.-b~dt.ed, birthright\u00ad yaw counter-squelching B .1. c. three, as well as the \"Be*a Tiff an [ B.S.d.two\u00ad the sobriety of Milton in the ?all of immortal v waters, 4.a[~-06], e.two).

Hawthorne's remarks, in \"Chiefly About War Matters, by a Peaceable Man\" (Atlantic Monthly, July, 1862), on Lincoln's round-about-the-mouth serpentine gesturing: \" and the lines about his mouth are very strongly defined. I I ... although, without his 'gesticulation of eye and mouth,--and especially the flourish of the whip ['gift' of the Massachusetts delegation], --I doubt whether his words would be worth recording, even if I could remember them. \" (RE, XII [1883; 1886], 310, 312; cf. H. on Raphael, in my I.B.l [also in End Notes.5]). And finally, note in publisher James T. Fields's commentary, first an anecdotal-comparative assessment, of the reserves of aggression in Hawthorne's mild-conversational verbal manner, during a London visit with his friend and client in spring of 1860 (Hawthorne [1876], p. 80): \"In London we strolled along the Strand, day after day, now diving into Bolt Court, in pursuit of Johnson's whereabouts, and now stumbling around the Temple, where Goldsmith at one time had his quarters. Hawthorne was never weary of standing on London Bridge, and watching the steamers plying up and down the Thames. I was much amused by his manner towards tmpudent beggars, scores of whom would attack us even in the shortest walk. He had a mild way of making a severe and cutting remark, which used to remind me of a little incident which Charlotte Cushman once related to me. She said a man in the gallery of a-theatre (I think she was on the stage at the time) made such a disturbance that the play could not proceed. Cries of 'Throw him over' arose from all parts of the house, and the noise became furious. All was tumultuous chaos until a sweet and gentle female voice was heard in the pit, exclaiming, 'No! I pray you don't throw him over! I beg of you, dear friends, don't throw him over, but--kill him where he is.' [Charlotte Cushman-- American actress, 1816-1876.]\" Then note, in Fields's memories of the declining physical strength of Hawthorne (1860-1864), signature-anthemal features of self-address by Hawthorne to God and (implicit) identification with a Providentially-productively failing, even self-destructive, English vine (Hawthorne [1876], and pp. 117-18, 125): \"Those were troublous days, full of war gloom and general despondency. I \"Our Old Home\" was published in the autumn of 1863 . I Meantime, the \"Dolliver Romance,\" which had been laid aside on account of the exciting scenes through which we were then passing, and which unfitted him for the composition of a work of the imagination, made little progress. In a note written to me at this time he [Hawthorne] says: I 'I can't tell you when to expect an instalment of the 482 Romance, if ever. There is something preternatural in my reluctance to begin. I linger at the threshold, and have a perception of very. disagreeable phantasms to be encountered if I enter. I wish God had given me the faculty of writing a sunshiny book.' I [/ And:] On MOnday, the 28th of Karch [1864; --or two months before his death, May 18th/19th, 1864], Hawthorne came to town [Boston] and made my house his first station on a journey to the South for health. I was greatly shocked at his invalid appearance, and he seemed quite deaf[!]. The light in his eye was.beautiful as ever, but his limbs seemed shrunken and his usual stalwart vigor utterly gone. He said to me with a pathetic voice, 'Why does Nature treat us like little children! I think we could bear it all if we knew our fate; at least it would not make much difference to me now what became of me.' Toward night he brightened up a little, and his delicious wit flashed out, at intervals, as of old; but he was evidently broken and dispirited about his health. Looking out on the bay that was sparkling in the moonlight, he said he thought the moon rather lost something of its charm for him as he grew older. He spoke with great delight of a little story, called 'Pet Marjorie,'' and said he had read it carefully through twice, every word of it. He had much to say about England, and observed, among other things, that 'the extent over which her dominions are spread leads her to fancy herself stronger than she really is; but she is not to-day a powerful empire; she is much like a squash-vine, w~ich runs over a whole garden, but, if you cut it at the root, it is at once destroyed.' At breakfast, next morning, he spoke of his kind neighbors in Concord, and said Alcott was one of the most excellent men he had ever known. 'It is impossible to quarrel with him, for he would take all your harsh words like a saint.' I He [Hawthorne] left us shortly after this for a journey to Washington, with his friend Mr. Ticknor. [O]n [a] Sunday morning the news came that Mr. Ticknor was dead. Hawthorne re_turned at once to Boston, and stayed here over night. He was in a very excited and nervous state, and talked incess~ntly of the sad scenes he had just been passing through. We sat late together, conversing of the friend we had lost, and I am sure he hardly closed his eyes that night. In the morning he went back to his own home in Concord. I His health, from that time, seemed to give way rapidly \" (See again my I.End Notes.l7[c,iii-iv]. Cf. F. 0.

THE EVALUATION: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HAWTHORNE'S CONSONANT-GESTURAL SCALE OF AMBUSH. Milton, indeed, had a true English taste for the pleasures of the table, though refined by the lofty and poetic discipline to which he had subjected himself. It is delicately implied in the refection in Paradise, and more substantially, though still elegantly betrayed in the sonnet proposing to 11Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son,\" a series of nice little dinners in mid-winter; and it blazes fully out in that untasted banquet which, elaborate as it was, Satan tossed up in a trice from the kitchen-ranges of Tartarus. 1 --\"Civic Banquets,\" Our Old Home, p. 311. A. Introduction: Resume of the Application, and Turn to the Contexts of Evaluation. Summarized as point [2.a] in the closing outline of section II.B.l (Construction) of the thesis, a scale of consonant-figures with oral/vegetal-tags has served to guide in Chapter III (Application) an extensive rereading of Hawthorne's prose texts as a five-fold discourse on his immortal name--as an apocalyptic hunger-art, a perpetually encoded request for existential feeding of signature, for its signif- icant sign-magnificent presence beyond historical process, via oral- contactive anchoring of motor-organismic signs. Of what value is the perception? Or, is this private and primitive organismic message significant? --To the understanding of Hawthorne? To the understanding of authors other than Hawthorne? To the understanding of language and mind? 484 485 Philip F. Gura, 1n The Wisdom of Words: Language, Theology, and Literature in the New England Renaissance (1981),2 has remarked that, during the period 1800-1860, \"the study of language (especially of its origins) was.a vital topic with humanistic implications increasingly difficult for our generation to comprehend,\" and that today 11iw]hen the study of language is mentioned, students whose sole exposure to its modern theory consists of a hazy incantation of 'psycholinguistics' or 'transformational g\u00b7rammar' find it difficult to conceive how in the nineteenth century the study of language mattered in any practical way or how the budding science of philology had repercussions in such disparate areas as education, theology, and art\" (p. 5). Citing Hans Aarsleff, \"whose Study of Language in England, 1760-1860 [1967] serves as a useful reference point for parts of [his, Gura's] book,\" P. Gura comments that Aarsleff \"touches the heart of the matter when he explains that language study, even when called philology, was not merely 'a matter of knowing the forms, syntax, phonology, historical relationships, and other aspects of particular languages,\"' but that \"[t]he questions involved were of larger significance.\" Continuing to cite Aarsleff, Gura asks, \"'What, for instance, was the or1g1n of thought? Did the mind have a material basis? Did mankind have a single origin? Was the first language given by revelation or had man invented it in the process of time?\"' (Gura, p. 5; Aarsleff, p. 4). \"If we can understand why the men involved in investigations of language and its symbolic potential considered their work an attempt to answer such questions,\" Gura points out, \"their dedication to what 486 in retrospect seems like inane or, at best, antiquarian wordplay comes into meaningful focus.\" Also, \"when we consider how our modern notion of the heuristic value of symbolism can be traced to a concern with\"the possibility of an intrinsic ambiguity to all speech, the philosophical debates over language between 1800 and 1860 become more significant\" (Gura, p. 5). With regard to Hawthorne (and Mel\u00ad ville), Philip Gura remarks that \"Hawthorne and Melville themselves never were concerned with specific philosophies of language, a topic that held unending fascination for Thoreau\" (p. 7). (Note, how\u00ad ever, Hawthorne'sdramatic incorporation of Rousseau-proximate gesture\u00ad theory in his living resurrection of the marble faun, with social psyche deepened through action over sign-natural gorge/throat--see again my too,\" Gura continues, \"were heirs to an age characterized by an increasing skepticism regarding man's ability to decipher, let alone justify [~ la John Milton, Paradise Lost, I.26], the ways of God to men\" _(Gura, p. 7). Gura explains that it was \"the developments in biblical criticism on the Continent, as well as the increasingly acrimonious bickering among Protestant sects in the years prior to 1850,\" over \"literal[]\" and \"symbolical[]\" interpretations of scriptural language that \"left profoundly religious men like Hawthorne and Melville unable to investigate theological problems through the sentimental or moralistic modes they might have used twenty-five years earlier,\" and to work toward \"a prose style commensurate to the complexity of the 1850s\" (p. 7). Gura comments that \"[i]n 1800, for example, it -would 487 have been blasphemous for any Trinitarian to assert that a triune God was not so much a real as a symbolic concept; but, from 1849 on, Horace Bushnell made precisely such assertions from his Congregational pulpit fn Hartford[, Conn.], and by the 1860s they became the foundation for the new liberal movement in Protestant theology.[]\" And, Gura continues that \"[t]he imaginative distance between these ideas <?f an essentially 'poetic' theology and the philosophical romances of Hawthorne and ' Melville, in which the elusive ever-ambiguous nature of transcendent experience was to be suggested through new literary devices, is not as great as one might assume\" (p. 8). (Note the texts-transcendent, heuristic re-use of Triune idea in the present study, to advance the idea of Hawthorne's all-embracing use of name as demiurgic address to God, 1n terms of God's literal and lexical [phonetic and of the x-glide might be particulary noted, as voice- tongue extensor, I.C. III.A('c'--five)]). In Chapter 8 of his study, titled \"Ambiguity and Its Fruits: Toward Hawthorne and Melville,\" Philip Gura (perhaps sum-serpent appropriately) indicates that \"[a] question of faith animates the structure of Hawthorne's major romance, The Scarlet Letter,\" as it does the \"almost traneparently 488 allegorical[] 'Young Goodman Brown' Minister's Black Veil'--and that all three ultimately \"point the reader to the larger que_stions of language and meaning that vexed their author\" (Gura, PP 154 and 153). The present study has attempted,\u00b7then (and not in discord with historical context), to become engaged in Hawthorne's challenge to reader as individual, to move toward the \"larger questions of language and meaning\" (Gura) signalled by his auxiliary, prefatorial, and literary texts. And the larger humanistic value of the private and primitive organismic messa~e--the oral-transactional, hermaphro\u00ad symbolic, circum-tree-posturing-in-chant-petition-for-Divine-Suste\u00ad nanc~--which the study has reiterated as the meaning of Hawthorne's claim to \"consonance\" III.A[ 'a'-'e'], to give an individ\u00ad ualistic, yet oral-articulatory placement of the author within the larger philological concerns of the period, within the English literary tradition of speech on speech which would enhance such period placement, and within that historically continuing activity--humanity's linguistic\u00ad study-of-itself-as mind-builder--which would advance methodological placement of consonant/vegetal-gesturing within present-day study of literary form. To suggest the power of the construct-Hawthornesque to place Hawthorne, the study here (i.e., now, in the chapter introduction) points to Philip Gura's own (pp. 129-37) rich appreciation within the oral-vegetal idea (consonance not stressed), of a relationship of -period: influence between articulatory-origins philologist and (re)educ~tor 489 Charles Kraitsir (Glossology, 1852) and American Romantic prose artist Henry David Thoreau (Walden, 1854); it mentions John Rees's (1967) minimizing treatment of the oral-linguistic idea within the milieu-and-family-proximities of Charles Kraitsir (The Significance of the Alphabet, 1846), Elizabeth Peabody (\"Language, !t Aesthetic Papers, 1849; The House of the Seven Gables, 1851);3 and it offers itself as independent index, to the idiosyncratic, formal harmony of Hawthorne with the oral-philological, the oral-literary, the mouth-matter and mind retuning Peabody-Kraitsir-Thoreau milieu, which perhaps served to rein- force the development of the particular, signatural genius that we as readers intuit as Hawthorne's own complexity to this very day (see suggest the broader power of the scale-Hawthorn- esque to place Hawth?rne--within language-contexts of trans-Christian oral-immortal confraternity--the study in the chapter development below (Part B) offers three Hawthorne-correlative gatherings l of texts (of prose and verse commentary from critical, scholarly, and popular sources, of prose and verse citations from Period sources, and of prose and verse excerpts from the English tradition of literature) specifically to demonstrate: (1) grades of oral-reflexing of Haw- thorne's signature-poetic criticism; (2) of Hawthorne's signature within Period literary- craft friendships; and (3) grades of mouth-cradled petition for orphic signature-life, in Hawthorne-backing, Christian centuries of sp~ech-490 conscious English poetic memory. Finally, recognizing the value of the scale-Hawthornesque, as perceptual stratagem for examining aspects of oral continuity in critical and literary texts, the study in the chapter conclusion (Part C) discusses within the context of linguistic science--within the context of the linguistic study of human mind- building--the methodological placement of consonant/vegetal gesturing, among the present-day viables, for the futur~ study of sound-grown poetic form. B. Development: The Scale-Hawthornesque in Three Trans-Contexts of Hawthorne Response. 1. Trans-Contexts: Grades of Oral-Reflexing of Hawthorne in Twentieth-Century Criticism. The gathering below of prose and verse texts from twentieth\u00ad century criticism (eleven authors4) constitutes a select trans-histor- ical portrait of the signatural Hawthorne as oral ' self-constrictor (perhaps oral-formal hunger-striker, and suggestive self-killer?), at varying and possibly even successive step-depths of the oral-mental cave, of his flesh-regenerative, private-botanical Godhead. Texts are placed at split-step--i.e., first according to a guiding construct of criticism or metaphor of response (one suggestive of oral stance--see esp. II.B.l, closing point [I.e]), then according to Hawthorne text(s) critically or metaphorically responded to (or, 491 according to Hawthorne step-value in II.B or III.B of the present study). The-select, or (better)--the privi-orally tendentious-- twentieth-century critical mirror reads with remarks follows. (The'scale is STEPS 5-1--reader ingressive, recollective direction. Criticonceptacle head tags serve to recapitulate the frame remarks and to specify the name-biased, mouth-angled, form-regenerating feeder- reflector critics sampled.) The commentary sampled immediately below, from a discussion by a Marxist critic of a rhetoric of privilege in The House of the Seven Gables, represents a twentieth-century near-thematic, or potential, response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead--to Hawthorne's signatural mouth-woodworks--at the fifth step of the scale of oral consonance, as the stance, or level, of face and face-mimicking surfaces, trans- parent through opaque. The selected commentary reads as follows: CRITICONCEPTACLE 5/2--B. Thomas [19821, \"not natural law / faced\") The status given a deed of property confirms the idea that an owner's authority to possess land is embodied in a text. A deed allows the person whose name is affixed to it to claim ownership of a piece of land. In a sense the document and the piece of property merge. The owner of the deed is the owner of the land. The owner's name coincides with the land. The House of the Seven Gables is located on Pyncheon Street, and the tree beside the house is called the Pyncheon elm. But Hawthorne is acutely aware that sign and signifier do not coincide. Texts--including legal docu\u00ad ments--have human authors and therefore derive their authority from human actions, not natural law. Furthermore, a document may as easily come from the irrational area of imagination as from the rational authority of a democracy's most sacred texts--its legal documents. Perhaps, like Hawthorne, the authors of legal documents should acknowledge their subjective points of view. To do so, however, would undercut the authority of the documents--creating the same diiemma that Hawthorne faced in acknowledging himself as .. 492 the author of his tale--because to be effective a legal document must convince its readers that it is based on reality, not rhetoric. The writers of laws must carefully hide their authorship (often even from themselves) and make it appear as if the laws had no point of view. In fact, the Pyncheons' manipulation of public opinion to acquire and maintain their lands is a masterful use of the narrative technique that creates documents that seem to have written them\u00ad selves. Colonel Pyncheon originally asserts \"plausible claims to proprietorship\" of Matthew Maule's land \"on the strength of a grant from the legislature\" ([Cent. Ed.,] 7), the Pyncheons maintain their right to property on the basis of another document--a will. They then can protect this right of inheritance as a natural right by still other documents--laws passed by a legislature whose point of view reflects the will of the powerful, not the will of the people. While the point of view of these documents is never acknowledged, Hawthorne's tale makes us see that all documents extend someone's will onto a printed text and that many attempt to shape a world to conform to that will. I [--Pp. 199b-200a.] The discussion by a Marxist critic sampled immediately above has served to illustra~e a twentieth-century near-thematic, or potential, response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at the fifth step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of face and face-mimicking surfaces, transparent through opaque. The discussion offered immediately below, commentary by a historically and linguistically informed explicator of The Scarlet Letter and \"Monsieur du Miroir,\" represents a twentieth-century thematic, or active, response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at the fifth-step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of face and face-mimicking surfaces, transparent through opaque. The selected discussion, presented in two parts, reads as follows: 493 CRITICONCEPTACLE 5/3,1--J. Irwin [1980], \"not to his \"accustomed room\" with \"its books, its windows, its fireplace, and the tapestried comfort of the walls,\" he is affected by \"the same perception of strangeness that had haunted him throughout his walk from the forest-dell into town\" ([CE,] 1:222), though now this uncanny sense of the unfamil\u00ad iarity o~familiar objects is explicitly related to a division in the self manifested by a written text. Dimmesdale sees on the table \"an unfinished sermon, with a sentence [ yel Haw! -.] broken in the midst\" and thinks that \"it was himself, the thin and white-cheeked minister\" who had \"written thus far, into the Election Sermon! But he seemed to stand apart, and eye this former self with scornful, pitying, but half-envious curiosity. That self was gone! Another man had returned out of the forest; a wiser one; with a knowledge of hidden mysteries which the simplicity of the former never could have reached\" (1:223). As Dimmesdale looks at the \"tapestried comfort of the walls\" and then at his unfinished manuscript, Hawthorne encourages the reader to equate the picto\u00ad graph embroidered on the veil and its revelation of Dimmesdale's double role with the phonetic script of Dimmesdale's text and its manifestation of his divided self. The internally split I exter\u00ad nally doubled terms of this equation are Hawthorne's means of questioning the symbolist effort to make opaque phonetic script achieve a force of expression equivalent to the necessary trans\u00ad parency of a pictograph. For Hawthorne implies that a pictograph's transparency is simply the uncertain, illusory transparency of a mirror image. Hawthorne's most concentrated examination of the mystery of a mirror image is found in the sketch \"Monsieur du Miroir\" (1837). Treating his reflection as if it were another person, Hawthorne communicates some of its pictographic doubleness to the phonetic script of his text in the form of endlessly proliferating double meanings Besides evoking the opaque arbitrariness of phonetic script--its concealment of the sameness of meaning (the mirror image) beneath a difference in translation (Monsieur du Miroir, Caballero de los Espejoz)--the passage also suggests, through its location of Miroir's genealogical origin in a fictive character, that the reflected image Hawthorne has in mind is less the visual twin in his mirror than the hieroglyphic double con\u00ad stituted by his own writings. He observes that the principal cause of the phonetic difference between himself and his picto\u00ad graphic double is that Miroir, like Narcissus's image in the pool, \"lacks the faculty of speech\": \"His lips are sometimes seen to move; his eyes and countenance are alive with shifting expression, as if corresponding by visible hieroglyphics to his modulated breath; and anon, he will seem to pause, with as satisfied an air, 494 as if he had been talking excellent sense\" (10:160). I Beginning with the reference to his image's shifting expressions as \"visible hieroglyphics,\" Hawthorne brings together, within the space of a few pages, virtually all the structural elements and imagery associated with hieroglyphic doubling by the writers of the American Renaissance.

Writing at a time when \"criticks and reviewers [were] exer\u00ad cising jurisdiction not only upon the literary but moral blemishes of the authors,\" [citation from T. Martin, The Instructed Vision, 1961,] Hawthorne made numerous changes which reveal his sensitivity to current, often prudish, standards of taste. His substitution of \"sectarian\" for \"sectual\" and \"woman\" for \"female\" are examples of his painstaking avoidance of any words that hinted, however innoc\u00ad uously, at indelicacy. So also are two larger_deletions. In uThe Gentle Boy\" he dropped the fiul subordinate clause in this sentence describing the attack of the Puritan children on the Quaker boy Ilbrahim: \"The poor child's arms had been raised to guard his head from the storm of blows; but now he dropped them at once, for he was stricken in a tender part.\" Although the context makes clear that the boy had been hit in the face and not in the groin, the construction must have involved for Hawthorne a sexual as well as a linguistic awkwardness. [Note! The boy had been 'struck on the mouth, so forcibly that the blood issued in a stream.'--CE, IX:92; see my III.B.3.e.two.] The desire to avoid any matter~is audience might consider prurient is evident in Hawthorne's deletion the framework surrounding Higgin\u00ad botham's \"Passages from a Relinquished Work\"-\u00ad see my III.B.5.a(f-03)], part of which involves a conversation between Hawthorne's persona and \"a young person of doubtful sex.\" In his anonymous magazine version Hawthorne had allowed his nar\u00ad rator to find the person so \"bewitching\" that \"at the proper moment, I stepped forward, with a gay heart and a bold one\" to ask for a dance. Signing his name to the collection, however, Haw- thorne removed this episode.

His changes of \"wash\" to \"cleanse\" and \"attic\" to \"garret\" are examples which, like his occasional substitutions of one grammatical construction for another equally correct, anticipate the kinds of changes Sophia Hawthorne [his wife] later made when editing his American Notebooks. Hawthorne's own revisions in 1837 demonstrate that, even before Sophia had any influence on him, his acute sense of the limitations of his readers made him unwilling to risk printing in acknowledged tales some words and attitudes he had felt free to publish anony\u00ad mously.

Like any schema, it cannot compass the resonance and richness of the work itself; it will not even attempt to account for every character whom Hawthorne created. But it may reveal in a new way the currents of energy that shaped his deepest vision. I [ --P. 214.] 498 And, H. McPherson [1969], \"cryptic preoccupation,\" continued) The Cadmus myth, in terms poetic or symbolic meaning, is the most revealing of the tales which explore the nature [or \"psychol\u00ad og(y)\"] of the self. The atmosphere of the story is dreamlike, almost from the beginning, and the highly.stylized use of repeti\u00ad tion gives it a ritual quality which makes the step from the actual to the symbolic very easy. I . . .. . I His labyrinthine wan~erings in pursuit of the oracular cow lead him, finally, to a fountain in a grove guarded by a serpent. In an astonishing scene which is Hawthorne's own invention, Cadmus leaps down the throat of his monster and destroys it; he then transforms its destructive teeth into a virile company who end his exile by creating a new community. His exploit, moreover, is so acceptable to the gods that, although they do not (as in Anthon) attend his wedding, they give a 'daughter of the sk.y' called Harmonia, as a reward. Harmonia, Hawthorne suggests, not only resembles Europa [=European culture/experience! linguistically/ glandularly harmonized with also compre\u00ad hends for Cadmus the affection of mother, sister, friend, and brother. Although stopping short of the fully explicit, Hawthorne makes it clear that Cadmus' ordeal is a spiritual rebirth. His symbolic death in the serpent's jaws [=self-translation (A. K. V.)] results not in a rediscovery of the lost innocence of Europa, but in an ability to organize the destructive, warring forces of the self, and use them creatively in the community of human beings. But this, in variant form, is the experience of Midas[,] whose symbolic death by water [of throat-quicksilver!] saved him from the isolation and loneliness of his obsession and restored to him the human values of love and sympathy. It is also the [orifice\u00ad serpentine!] experience of Prosperina[,] whose descent into the underworld transformed her irresponsible life of play into a mature life of qualified pleasures. Jason, too, experienced a symbolic death when the fiery bulls enveloped him in flame [\"(t)he fiery bulls of 'The Golden Fleece' can scarcely eat because they destroy their natural food by fire\"]; and Bellerophon and Pegasus [with gold/yel! log in mouth], flew, at least figuratively, into the snaky jaws of the Chim[a]era.

The commentary offered directly below comes from a discussion of Fanshawe and The Marble Faun, by a critic assessing qualities of English literary heritage (Renaissance, Neo-Classical, Gothic-Romantic Revival) in Hawthorne's style of composition. That influence-conscious commen- tary on form and effect amounts to a twentieth-century erotica-rechan- neling potential response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at the fourth step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of sub-facial voice-stream and self-enriching somatic fluids. The Gross [1963], \"gasping fish . insinuative\") Balance qualification in syntax and thought; lucid, abstract, elevated diction; and emphasis on ontology; philosophized description; the precedence of the conceptual and the general over the concrete and the specific: these are some of the stylistic characteristics of Hawthorne's first novel, and they set the pat\u00ad tern for his mature writing. Throughout his career, however, he tried to make his fiction not only profound, but also lurid. His future manner of greatness is discernible in his blending of a conceptual style with Gothic horror in behalf of a serious theme. 500 Fanshawe, who has to choose between a nubile girl for whom he longs and the destructive studies to which he is already wed, is the prototype of Hawthorne'~ large cast of divided and doomed intellec\u00ad tuals. He is victim, hero, thematic configuration, and also Gothic personage. As an intellectual, his destiny lies in depletion and alienation. Hawthorne's favorite subject continued to be a crisis of commitment and conscience in which someone [fish-like!] like Fanshawe has to face the contrary urgings of head and heart; and his technique of psychological analysis continued to rely on the nightmarish terrors of the Gothic landscape, where symbolic threats lurk behind every bend(--see: William Bysshe Stein, Hawthorne's Faust: A Study of the Devil Archetrpe (Gainesville, Fla., 1953); Carl Bode, \"Hawthorne's Fanshawe: The Promising Greatness,\"~ I (1955), 73-95]. Already under the combined influence of Milton and Bunyan, on one hand, and Scott and the writers of the roman nair, on the other, he makes his attempt in Fanshawe to give a study of a moral and psychological dilemma the impact of the horrible. He also exhibits his familiarity with the colonial evangelists, who had tried, as someone has observed, to terrorize their audiences into a state of grace. The Gothic elements produce a superficial narrative interest ~hrough the excited anticipation of strange outcomes; but unifying his moral ends and.Gothic means, Hawthorne primarily tries to show things from the standpoint of their significance, which, by his method, becomes their frightening significance. His mise-en-scene reverberates with portent: event,. dialogue, and imagery have an insinuative quality; they seem to contain mysterious promises, sinister hints, and also moral fore\u00ad casts. Almost everything quivers with a double entendre. In short, he attempts to make of the provincial American scene which provides the background of Fanshawe a poetic precinct--an intense stage--where his characters may act out in a shocking light their thematic tragedies and symbolic woes. I I Th(e] burial marker for Butler and the monument erected to Fanshawe after his death presage the many grave-stones and allusions to interment in Hawthorne's prefaces, stories, and novels. He finally succeeded, in The Marble Faun, in an immense symbolic magnification of this Gothic motif by treating Rome as a vast, mysterious, shattered sepulchre of European culture. I Even in Fanshawe he skillfully manages to tie the images together in significant pairs: the labyrinthine garden with the intricate forest path; the pool with the sparkling fountain; the view over-looking the fish with the high point on the precipice; the recess beneath the bank with the cave in the rock; Ellen's pebble with Fanshawe's stone; the gasping fish with Ellen and also with Butler in his plunge to a violent death; the ascetic scholar with the rapist adventurer. Most of the images are non- sensory; their function is figurative and insinuative, not .mimetic 501 or naturalistic, even though they are part of the natural scenery. [' The interconnecting of imagery\u00b7 and phraseology is sustained throughout the novel '] It must be acknowledged, how\u00ad ever, that the images are attached to narrative material which is immature and trivial.

The discussion sampled immediately below is offered by a critic who has compared texts and techniques (those of the major novels and the unfinished works) to diagnose the characteristics of Hawthorne's ultimate failure of creativity. That sampled instance of author- diagnosis constitutes a twentieth-century script-animative, near- imitative, potency-challenging potential response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at the fourth step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of sub-facial voice-stream and self-enriching somatic fluids. The Davidson (1949], \"gasping fish \u00b7 . insinuative,\" extension) Hawthorne so often called himself a romancer that the name [=roe-thorn!] has become almost synonymous with the man. It is perhaps sufficient to say that Hawthorne had inherited a Puritan's and an allegorist's preoccupation with sin; he may have found that interest coursing in his blood stream when he was born, the heritage of a witch judge and the generations of Hathornes in Salem, or he may have obtained it from his reading. Whatever its 502 origins, we know that Hawthorne had this Puritan bias and a strong preoccupation with the effects of sin on men and women, both dead and living. Therefore, when he made studies of those people, he wrote allegories--the representation of abstract vices and virtues in recognizable terms which all men understand. A definition of Hawthorne the romancer is more difficult than that of the allegorist. In general, we may say that he was \"roman\u00ad tic\" in his interest in the past, in his use of timeless subjects rather than those of contemporary interest, and in his concern with the damaged souls of men rather than with their faces and clothes. What were the proper circumstances which Hawthorne, the romancer, had to discover before he could compose a npvel? Why did he fail in the last years? The second question I shall with\u00ad hold but the first I shall try to answer. In the germination of a romance, Hawthorne's mind seized two things: the first was a moral law and the second a romantic image or episode. The moral need not have been of great human value ['Hawthorne, as an allegorical romancer, was not personally inter\u00ad ested in the operation of moral laws'--but 'he was passionately concerned with ('the moral world') as an artist']; it was generally a provisional truth with which h1s mind began to play: a woman taken in adultery, a family wronged through several generations, a man who goes back to England in search of his ancestry, or a youth defying the rules of mortal life by concocting a brew of immortality. The second--the image or episode--is \"romantic\" because Hawthorne was concerned not with the realistic study of life, such as he found in Dickens or Trollope, but with men's souls; and for an investigation of secret hearts he must have a focus, a visual representation of the abstract moral he was seeking to demonstrate. The images may be best illustrated by his use of a letter A,, a faun with furry ears, a bloody footstep, or a magic elixir shimmering in the sunlight. Then there were the romantic episodes which struck his imagination: a man lying dead 1n a parlor with the blood oozing from his mouth, , What came next [after 'These \"germs\"] was a symbol, which I should define as the fusing of the image and the moral so that one became the visual representation of the other. The symbol was the fixing of the moral idea in concrete terms. Afterward, as the studies in this book are witness, Hawthorne projected characters and scene. When this magical event or moment took place, some hidden reservoir was tapped. One might well employ [Henry] James's figure in the Preface to The American [1877] which [J. L.] Lowes used so effectively in The Road Back to Xanadu [1927]: a \"deep well of unconscious cerebration\"[] was stirred and there poured forth the 503 complete pattern of plot, characters, and scene which Hawthorne made into his four great romances. What is significant for Haw\u00ad thorne is that the process worked superbly from 1849 to 1860 and then failed him in the last phase. Perhaps even more significant than the strange magic of the process is the speed with which, once Hawthorne had planned his novels, he could write them. The Scarlet Letter was composed in about six months,[] The House of the Seven Gables in five.[] The most arduously written of the four romances was The Marble Faun\u00b7, [] but when\u00b7 we reach 1858 or 1859 we are approaching the crack-up. I [--Pp. 142, 144-5, w. p. 143.] The commentary presented directly above, by a critic who has compared texts and techniques to diagnose the characteristics of Hawthorne's creative failure, has served to illustrate a present-century script- animative, near-imitative, potency-challenging potential response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at the fourth step of the scale of oral con~onance, as the level of sub-facial voice-stream and self-enriching somatic fluids. Further commentary by the critic who has compared major novels and unfinished texts to diagnose the characteristics of Hawthorne's creative failure constitutes a twentieth-century potency-challenging and hunger-constraint re-investing potential response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at the fourth step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of sub-facial voice-stream and self-enriching somatic fluids. The further commentary follows: CRITICONCEPTACLE E. Davidson [1949], continued, \"nor sank into 'deep well\"') I shall now undertake to answer a question often raised in this book: why did Hawthorne fail in the last years? . 504 We can postulate a fifth reason for Hawthorne's failure in the last phase. It was that Hawthorne was unable to fuse image and moral in a symbol. The bloody footprint never became a work\u00ad able symbol, as had the letter A or the Faun of Praxiteles, because neither the moral idea nor the image sank into the \"deep well\"; they remained always on the surface of conjecture and planning. They were not usable, not because they were fantastic--nothing was too fantastic for Hawthorne's peculiar nature--but the circum\u00ad stances of the times in which-he lived [e.g., C:i.vil War]\u00b7 and his fundamental inability to take either the bloody footprint or the elixir of life as serious and important images forced Hawthorne into the hasty improvisations which he substituted .for the tough mental labor of years gone by. Thus the answer to the problem of Hawthorne's failure lies somewhere in the misty regions of fancy and imagination, as Coleridge differentiated them. In the studies for the posthumous romances, as well as in the long unfinished drafts, we find Hawthorne so often striving to set down a forceful statement of the \"central thought.\" What he implies is that he did not have clearly in mind the meaning of his tale. In Grimshawe he did not know at the beginning nor at the end whether his main character, Etherege or Redclyffe, should be a hero Miltonic Sun:Son]; in Septimius Felton he began with an attractive young man and contrived a fool ~t the ~onclusion of both drafts. Thus when neither focalizing moral nor the central image was fused in his imagination, he could expend his effort only in artless contrivings. Whether he planned the romances in his mind while roaming through Salem or over the hills of Lenox, or fashioned them on paper in the Wayside tower, the process was the same: characters were first puppets in a pageant of allegory; afterward they could become individuals, living and breathing. But the \"afterward\" in the last phase was a long time away. As late as the middle of Draft \"G\" [of Grimshawe] Hawthorne had no idea what shape the pensioner, Lord Braithwaite, or the English girl would take. Then, perhaps when the time was growing short and many pages had been wasted, he attempted to particularize. Of the pensioner he wrote in an aside, \"I must hit still upon some picturesque peculiarity to distinguish this man, and embody and symbolize his creed; that done, I think I should have hold of the right clew.\"[] Two-thirds of the way through the narrative he had no conception of the villain, \"Shall he be preternatural? A monkey? A Frankenstein? A man of straw? A man without a heart, made by machinery A worshipper of the sun? A cannibal? a ghoul? a vampire? a man who lives by sucking the blood of the young and beautiful?\"[] [H]e moved from the abstract to the real in creating his characters; and when he could not fictionally demonstrate his moral, his characters forever remained wraithlike [=underfed 154.] . 505 The discussion by the diagnostic critic of Hawthorne's ultimate failure continued immediately above has served to illustrate a present-century potency-challenging and hunger-constraint re-investing potential response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at the fourth step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of sub-facial voice-stream and self-enriching somatic fluids. The piece of poetry quoted directly below, a verse paragraph by a Proserpinal-traditions sharing English literary artist, one who has responded as critic to Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, offers a twen- tieth-century paradigm of the oral-vegetal regenerative oracular receptacle. That suggests potential for strong reconstructive response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at steps five, four, and three. of the scale of oral consonance, as levels of oral descent--from face and face-mimicking surfaces (transparent through opaque), through sub-facial voice-stream and self-enriching fluids, to tongue and split-sexes in phonic grave engrafted.

Further, the traditional Protes\u00ad tant bodies of the South are evaporating into secularism and respectability and are being replaced on the grass roots level by all sorts of strange sects that bear not much resemblance to traditional Protestantism--Jehovah's Witnesses, snake-handlers, Free Thinking Christians, Independent Prophets, the swindlers, the mad, and sometimes the genuinely inspired. A character has to be true to his own nature and I think the old man is that. He was a prophet, not a church-member. As a prophet, he has to be a natural Catholic. Hawthorne said he didn't write novels, he wrote romances; I am one of his descendants. In any case, your critique is too far from the spirit of the book to make me want to go into it with you in detail. I do hope, however, that you will get over the kind of thinking that sees in 510 every door handle a phallic symbol and that ascribes such intentions to those who have other fish to fry. The Freudian technique can be applied to anything at all with equally ridiculous results. The fork of the tree! My Lord, Billy, recover your simplicity. You ain't in Manhattan.

We'll look for you for Thanksgiving day [--Letter to William Sessions (13 September 60), The Habit of Being (1979), p. 407.] The commentary by an American literary artist of the feminine sex presented directly above has served to illustrate a present-century organisms-compatible, resistive potential reconstructive response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at steps five, four, and three of the scale of oral consonance, as the levels of face and face-mimicking surfaces, transparent through opaque, of sub-facial voice-stream and self-enriching somatic fluids, and of tongue and split-sexes in phonic grave engrafted. The commentary offered directly below comes from what is in general a condemnatory evaluation of the major novels (and of a tale and the unfinished works), given by a critic examining the historical foundations of American literary form. That near-condemnatory commen- tary represents a twentieth-century to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at the second step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of deep throat back in chamber, with gut-and-God-given voice, in face-rounding yet neck-truncating action (or, the level of paradoxically self-511 indicting, formally precarious, Haw-formula-hungry form). The selected remarks, presented in two parts (with critic's sequence reversed), read as follows: CRITICONCEPTACLE 2/[5-]3-1--Y. Winters [1938], \"works by lip[:] / blood to drink\") The English Puritans who settled Massachusetts were socially the product of centuries of the type of ethical discipline fostered by the Catholic and Anglo-Catholic Churches. They may have denied the freedom of the will and the efficaciousness of good works by lip, but by habit, and without really grasping the fact, they believed in them and acted upon them. Edwards exhorts sinners to repent while preaching the doctrine of the inability to repent I I Foster writes : \"The first Puritans, sure in their own hearts that they were the elect of God, found the doctrine [='the Manicheistic struggle between Absolute Good and Absolute Evil as a kind of preordained or mechanical, ye't also holy combat'] necessary to sustain them in the tremendous struggle through which they passed. Hence the doctrine nerved to greater activity .... \"[] It is for his seal a skull and cross\u00ad bones\"'] , that the Puritans cannot be discussed, nor can they discuss each other, without the language employed exceeding the limits proper to predestinarians and invoking the traditional morality of the older churches The imperceptive, unwavering brutality of many-of the actions committed in the name of piety in the Massachusetts colonies more than justified the curse and proph\u00ad ecy uttered by Matthew Maule, that God would give these Puritans blood to drink; in the name of God, they had violently cut them\u00ad selves off from human nature; in the end, that is in Hawthorne's generation and in the generation following, more than one of them drank his own heart's blood, as Hawthorne himself must have done in his ultimate and frustrated solitude, and more than one of them shed it. I [--Maule's Curse: Seven Studies in the History pp. 8-9, 14-15. high-colors and veils/obscures their individual (Sign-)Nature--A. continued, \"compact[-] ~all[-] gory\") Of Hawthorne's three most important long works--The Scarlet Letter, The House of the Seven Gables, and The Marble Faun--the first is pure allegory, and the other two are impure novels, or novels with unassimilated allegorical elements. The first is faultless, in scheme and in detail; it is one of the chief master\u00ad pieces of English prose. The second and third are interesting, the third in particular, but both are failures, and neither would suffice to give the author a very high place in the history of prose fiction. I I Hawthorne, by nature an allegorist, and a man with a strong moral instinct, regardless of the condition of his ideas, found in the early history of his own people and region the perfect material for a masterpiece. By selecting sexual sin as the type of all sin, he was true alike to the exigencies of drama and of history. In the setting \u00b7which he chose, allegory was realism, the idea was life itself; and his prose, always remarkable for its polish and flexi\u00ad bility, and stripped, for once, of all superfluity, was reduced to the living idea, it intensified pure exposition to a quality comparable inits way to that of great poetry. The compactness and -complexity of the allegory will escape all save the most watchful readers. [--Pp. 3, 11-12.] The remarks offered directly above, from a critic examining the histori- cal foundations of American literary form, have served to illustrate a present-century potential reconstructive or near-imitative or \"curse\"- around-extending response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at the second step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of d~ep throat back in chamber, with gut-and-God-given voice, in face-rounding yet neck-truncating action (or, the level of paradoxically self\u00ad indicting, formally precarious, Haw-formula-hungry form). The commentary presented immediately below, from a critic applying psychoanalytic constructs to the \"Legends of the Province House\" (to examine and/or to structure Hawthorne's psycho-history as developing 513 American writer), represents a twentieth-century mouth-shaped, highly wit-conscious, near-active response to Hawthorne's signature- Godhead, at the second step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of deep throat back in chamber, with gut-and-God-given voice, in face-rounding yet neck-truncating action (or, the .level of paradoxically self-indicting, formally precarious, HB.w-formula-hungry form). The selected commentary, presented in two parts (as a conception of structure dynamically deepening within actual and virtuaL folds of mouth), reads as follows: CRITICONCEPTACLE 2/2--K. Dauber remarkable phrase [from Life Against Death: The Pszchoanalytic Meaning of History (1959; rpt. New York: Vintage, n.d.)], the \"constipating past\" inflicting itself upon the future, returns to assert Hutchinson's connection with an earlier era of even greater dependence. \"Excrement is also aliment\" [Brown, p. 293:] the blood on which Hutchinson, in his last hours, gasps he is choking returns us to dependence at the breast and the orality of \"Lady Eleanore's Mantle.\" Hawthorne's return to the Province-House this time, according~ ly, is by invitation to \"an oyster supper.\" He has come to eat, and what he eats has acquired, by a typically narcissistic piece of self-projection, the shape of his own voracious mouth. Interest\u00ad ingly, however, the dinner is a reward for the added custom he has brought with him. It is \"far less than the ingenious tale-teller, and I had fairly earned,\" he says. And, indeed, the pair are \"welcomed as benefactors\" (IX, 271). Hawthorne must excuse his pleasure. He must justify his narcissism in economic terms. Pleasure as business, orality as sensual (\"the oyster supper\") differentiated (\"the paying locates the Province-House at the second oral, or \"oral-sadistic,\" phase of child development. In technical terms, object-libido (sexuality) and ego-libido (self-preservation) are already at war. [ 'See Freud, \"On Narcissism ,\" in Col[.] Papers, IV (1953), 30-59, '] The fusion of primal narcissism--the baby at the breast, subject and object at one--has already broken down: \"It may be unadvisable, however, to speak too loudly of the increased 514 custom of the house, lest Mr. Waite should find it difficult to renew the lease on so favorable terms as heretofore\" (IX, 271-72). The mouth at war with economics is infected by it. Defending its sexuality, as we have seen, in economic terms, the mouth threatens to deny sexuality. Business makes the terms of pleasure unfavorable, and orality is business' mouthpiece. Ego-libido threatens object- libido; the sucking baby begins bite. I [--Rediscovering Hawthorne, pp. 75-76, w. nn. 18-19, adapt., and w. 73, n. 16, adapt.] And, K. Dauber [1977], \"compact complex all The oral-aggressive nature of \"Lady Eleanore's Mantle,\" then, is especially significant. Hawthorne describes the plague the Lady Eleanore has brought upon the nation: \"On the occasion of which I speak, it was distinguished by a peculiar virulence, inso~ much that it has left its traces--its pitmarks, to use an appro\u00ad priate figure--on the history of the country \" Psychoanalysis holds that sarcasm (Gr. sarkazein, to tear flesh) represents an oral attack on an object that withholds narcissistic pleasure,[ 'Jim Swan, \"History, Pastoral and Desire: A Psychoanalytic Study of English Literature and Society,\" Diss. Stanford, 1974, p. 251, cites M. D. Faber, Jaques: Psychological Remarks,\" University Review, 36 (1969-70), 89-96, 179-82. My discussion of orality throughout is heavily indebted to Swan.'] [A]nd the focus on perhaps mouth-shaped \"pitmarks\" further points up the orality of Hawthorne's aggression. Similarly, the people, \"in bitter mockery,\" proclaim \"a new triumph for the Lady Eleanore\" as the pox claims another victim, and Jervase Helwyse extends the \"triumph\" to Lady Eleanore's own destruction. Verbal wit, as opposed to phallic hostilities of \"Howe's Masquerade\" or the excremental wars of \"Edward Randolph's Portrait,\" is directed against a lady, a ..\"queenly maiden,\" the Virgin Mother, described as harsh, distant, literally \"unyielding.\" She cannot even weep. The lady is dry, and the child, denied nurture, his own brain parched by madness, turns the instrument of oral satisfaction against the breast that will not feed him. Of course sarcasm is no solution. The \"pitmarks,\" so called in an act of aggression, cannot be controlled. It is a \"dismal pit,\" in turn, into which the dead draw the living. The oral child projects his own mode of hostility onto a hostile mother. Seeking . to swallow her, he is afraid of being swallowed. His own desires, his subjectivity, denied, he becomes pure object, ready to be eaten up. I And, indeed a subject-object conflict . runs throughout Wild swings between introjection and projection, becoming all subject and all object, define Jervase's existence. We see him first as the lady's footstool .. At the end of the story, on her dying bed, it is to Jervase the lady calls for water. I 515 Significantly, it is a parching disease that Eleanore ultimately develops. Burned in effigy, literally dried up by her own inability to give and take succor, she makes possible, in her death, a world where subject and object may unite. \"King Death\" destroys the \"living queen.\" The \"diseased self-sufficient lady denies her all-encompassing\u00b7subjectivity, and Jervase, his madness dissipated, unites with the townsfolk in celebrating a new era. The way is prepared for Eros to inherit the Province-House. A new narrator who still reveres the queen, then, tells the tale of \"Old Esther Dudley.\" The tale, freed of conflict, \"is a mere sketch, with no involution of plot.\" Celebration of a completed development replaces what earlier had been progress toward an end. I In this connection, it is significant, too, that the journey into the past should end in the most modern period of time. The end is the beginning. Past and present unite. The point of furthest psychic regress is the point of nearest historic progress. The Province-House becomes the place of a coherent [mouth-cave!] phenomenology The community of the frame is solidified, its collective memory reformed. It may now accommodate even an \"old loyalist\" as \"no rival\" in its midst. I And yet Hawthorne leaves the house, declaring he will never return. He violently and precipitately escapes. It is difficult to account for this precisely. I Genital organization returns in Hancock--\"the ancient woman sank down beside one of the pillars of the portal. The [velar-hawk!] key of the Province-House fell from her grasp, and clanked against the stone\"--and with it the adult aggressiveness that the Legends of the Province-House had seemed to expel. ['Her love is narcissistic in Freud's neurotic sense, directed exclusively to projections of herself. (In t)he mirror itself '] I I The old conflict, public against private, returns. [--Pp. 76-81, w. n. 20, adapt.] The commentary presented immediately above, by a critic applying psycho- analytic constructs, has served to illustrate a present-century highly mouth-shaped, highly wit-conscious, near-active response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at the second step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of deep throat back in chamber, with gut-and-God-given voice, in face-rounding yet neck-truncating action (or, the level of paradoxically self-indicting, formally precarious, Haw-formula-hungry form). 516 More commentary by the critic applying psychoanalytic constructs to the \"Legends of a Province House\" has been drawn from a further section of the critic's study, a section in which he applies philo- sophical spatial abstractions chiefly to The Blithedale Romance (to examine and/or to formulate the purposive limits of Hawthorne's psycho- history as developing American writer). That psycho-structuralist commentary represents a twentieth-century highly near-to-book-format (or -book-jaws), highly articulatory-mechanisms conscious, near-active response to Hawthorne's signature-Godhead, at the second step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of deep throat back in chamber, with gut-and-God-given voice, in face-rounding yet neck-truncating action (or, the level of paradoxically self-indicting, formally pre- carious, Hiw-formula-hungry form). The selected further commentary, presented in two parts (as a conception of terminals, developing into a near-to-articulatory scaling of whole works), [1977], \"compact Perhaps we should systematically re-define the three major types of American fiction in the light of the turn they take in Hawthorne's Blithedale. Consider the diagram [=450- angle diagram, plotted on Cartesian co-ordinates--Dauber, p.l75]. The co-ordinates should be seen as dynamically related. Strictly speaking, neither ~\u00b7 genre, nor X purpose, exists except as it acts together. They call each other into being, are meaningless except as interanimating forces, so that, for example, the approach of either to zero is not its disappearance, but its submission to the other, which it overpowers. With this proviso we may proceed. Romance, as we have said, is the interplay of purpose and genre, a mutual coercion. The work inflicts itself on the writer, 517 provides the only language in which he may write. The writer~ in turn, imposes himself on his material, attempts to reform an audience reflected in the work. Accordingly, our diagram allows for a full range of histor\u00ad ical relativity [romance/naturalism/realism]. It maps a relation only, a ratio. As the diagram shows, realism is but a line. It is liable at any moment to become one or the other of the modes that bound it. And, in fact, where Blithedale is not the line itself, it is constantly playing off one against the other to establish a middle voice in effect. We have seen already the \"wizard\" as \"Professor\" of physiology. Westervelt the devil is also Westervelt the scientist and perhaps, finally, a simple mountebank, negating the claims of both. His false teeth are the mask of the demon, concealing the \"wizened little elf\" behind the mask, or there is no Westervelt at all, \"nothing genuine about him,\" save soulless parts pieced together. His body is \"a necro\u00ad mantic, or perhaps a mechanical contrivance\" (p. 188 [or, CE, III, 188]): the two are the same. In much the same way Holling;worth \"is a man after all ! (p. 71). Here overtly, the demonic and the mechanical are again equivalent: the devil-created philan\u00ad thropist is a steel engine. Moreover, as the noun \"philanthropy\" becomes an adjective in \"philanthropic man,\" demonism-mechanism becomes a simple qualifier of a general mankind, is familiarized into a neutral humanity [=anthropomorphe]. I Indeed, enaction is the only kind of action that there is in Blithedale. Throughout the book, as Coverdale [\"I\"/e'Y'e\u00ad narrator!] notes, the presence of Zenobia caused our heroic enterprise to show like an illusion, a masquerade, a pastoral, a counterfeit Arcadia, in which we grown-up men and women were making a play-day of the years that were given us to live in\" (p. 21). This is not to say, though, as is often said, that the characters are hypocritical, insincere in their attempts at Utopia. It is rather that performance, in Blithedale, is always to no purpose. As Coverdale continues, \"I tried to analyze this impres\u00ad sion, but not with much success.\" Quite simply, there is nothing to say about what the characters do, because what they do has no significance beyond itself. Action is what Angus Fletcher calls \"mimetic self-projection.\" ['\"The Liminal Riddle,\" a lecture presented on January 29, 1973(,) at the State University of New York at Buffalo.'] It is a kind of reflexive method-acting in which the character the actor enters is the character of an actor 518 entering a character which, however, does not exist. It is the imitation of a non-existent model, the opposite of celebration, as we have said, celebration of an absence rather than a presence. ['Note that in the masquerade, Zenobia plays the part of the Princess Zenobia, who seems not to exist, in Blithedale, simply to give Zenobia her name.'] I Consider Zenobia once again. She is, of course, a consummate actress. But her acting is no mere pretense. Zenobia does what she does, is what she is, and there is nothing more \u00b7to be said about it. \u00b7She is like God, in a way, the God \"I am that what I am,\" except--and here is the crucial difference between value and valuelessness, the speech that is prophecy and the speech that is realism--where God is the author of the world, [Zahne-oben! Zaun-der-Lippe-beobachten!] Zenobia's only world is herself. I Here, most important of all, Blithedale [as Maul!] inverts The House of the Seven Gables. There everything is [hug! jugular!] present in anything; here nothing relates to nothing [=lip/lap-winks!]. Fullness of action becomes emptiness of enaction. In other terms, as we have noted, The House of the Seven Gables would continue indefinitely. [--Pp. 189-91, w. nn. 28- 29, adapt., and w. Dauber-supportive, scale-relevant intrusions, A. K. V.] The further commentary from the critic applying psychoanalytic constructs, the psycho-structuralist commentary (a discussion ultimately, or termi- nally, turning into an axiological study [or a study of values]), has served to illustrate a present-century highly nature-Godhead, the1 second step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of deep throat back in chamber, with gut-and-God-given voice, in face-rounding yet neck-truncating action (or, the level of paradoxi- cally self-indicting, formally precarious, Haw-formula-hungry form). (Because K. Dauber's study addresses itself so directly to the ideas of mouth, name-play, and identity-development--its appropriately extensive citation will be resumed further ahead in the present chapter. Although K. Dauber posits no signature-cursive, serpentine form as a systematic 519 controlling eidolon [one bringing into high relief Hawthorne's name as an all-works animating--and all-critics challenging--form], the critic does offer interpretations which components [or aspects] of that as posited and etched .out consonan- tally in the present study.) The final critic in the gathering of exclusively present-century, time-crossing oral-reflectors upon the signatural Hawthorne comments in the two successions of citations offered below. That critic's commen- tary, drawn from his recent dissertation exploring aspects of Hawthorne's compositional process (through selected tales and The Scarlet Letter), re~resents a twentieth-century translation-sensitive, probably mouth- . . divisions attuned, Romantic-ambiance (or inspiration) addressing, and near-implicating highly active response to Hawthorne's oral- vegetal signature-Godhead; and it represents a response at the first step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of universal mouth with tongue and of writer's eternal soma.tic end-trails nosed into and out. The selected first succession of commentary is presented immedi- ately below in three parts, to sample qualities of ingression, or descent (chiefly through \"Rappaccini's Daughter,\" or from step-value tensor and (multi)potential lingam, rooted at throat. The selected first succession of commentary reads as follows: 520 [inspirational, visionary] forgetting and the consequent discrepancy between conception and execution are suggested by Hawthorne in the lighthearted and self\u00ad mocking introduction to his tale[, \"Rappaccini's Daughter\"]~ \"We do not remember,\" he remarks in the very first sentence, \"to have seen any translated specimens of the productions of M. de l'Aub[e]\u00ad pine \"([X,] 91, [F.'s] italics). Aub[e]pine. (French for \"hawthorn\") can be viewed as that aspect of the Romancer whose province is the garden of inspiration and who sees and gathers there the specimens which eventually are used in the writing of the work. Aub(e]pine is not so much Hawthorne as he is Hawthorn, a man familiar with the foliage of mind. The difference between what Aub[e]pine-Hawthorn sees in the garden and what Hawthorne writes on the page is considerable. L'Artiste du Beau; ou le Papillon M[ec]anique, to take just one example,is---a-\"work\"-;f Aub[e]pine's comprising five volumes, whereas \"The Artist of the Beautiful\" is only some twenty pages long. This discrepancy exists because, in the process of translating the vision in the garden and incorpora-ting it in the finished work, \"we do not remember.\" [Or--we sound-suggestively, lexically condense it! (A. K. V.)] The vision in the garden is embodied in Beatrice Rappaccini, an enchanting and beautiful girl, redolent of life, health and energy. Her voice is as rich as a tropical sunset.... I As a figure of inspiration, Beatrice has two striking qualities. Rich and delectable, her voice expresses itself \"like a gush of music\" (104), and causes one to \"think of [the same] deep hues of purple or crimson\" (96) that are contained in the sister-flower. Moreover, Beatrice's voice is \"embalmed\" in her breath (112), the fragrance of which. is \"identical to the flower's\" (113). The breath of inspiration and the voice which makes its meaning known bear \"upon [one's] consciousness like the light of truth itself.\" (112). I Thus \"Rappaccini's Daughter,\" the story of a young man and a young girl, is an allegory, as we shall see, of an artist-\u00ad or at least the surrogate of the artist Hawthorne--confronting his source of inspiration. As a trope for inspiration, Beatrice is an \"unintelligible power\" (109) who lacks \"familiarity with modes and forms\" (112). The artist's task will be to articulate that power and to formulate it in art. To that end, his \"quick fancy\" (105) will serve him well. But the young man has a heart whose depths are not yet sounded (105). We have only to trace his journey to see just how far he will plumb and how little he will remember.[] I [--Pp. 35-36.] 521 And, R. Freed [1979], Now he [the young man, Giovanni] \"must obey the law that whirl[s] him onward, in ever lessening circles\" (109) as he attempts to solve \"the riddle of his own existence\" (110). I These ever\u00ad lessening circles lead Giovanni to the garden itself where he con\u00ad verses with Beatrice. No longer an onlooker from the window above, he is now a \"brother\" in her own domain.... I I Rappaccini's garden, like Robin's midnight Boston and Hawthorne's haunted chamber in \"The Custom-House,\" is an image of the neutral territory.[] Each quest for inspiration brings dif- ferent aspects of self because the middle ground for Hawthorne is a mirror reflecting the full range of emotions he is capable of expressing. I . . . [T]he work of ar.t is born of the original \"commixture,\" the \"intercourse\" between the actual and the imagi\u00ad nary which imparts \"substance and reality to the wild vagaries [of] imagination\" ([110 and] 105). And the completed work of art not only results-- like Pearl [of The Scarlet Letter]--from \"adultery,\" it retains, like Rappaccini's flowers, a taint of \"artificialness\" because it is a fictive and transgressive \"pro\u00ad duction no longer of God's making\" (110). The successful artwork for Hawthorne contains the same baneful essence, the same disconcerting ambiguity, which resides in the middle ground and in the human heart. This ambiguous mixture of inspiration and evil occurs frequently in Hawthorne's art. The seat of inspiration and the locus of sin are contiguous elements in his fiction[] ['Failure to recognize this contiguity accounts for Richard P. Adams' puzzlement concerning \"Egotism: or, the Bosom Serpent.\" Adams writes in \"Hawthorne and the Old Manse Period,\" Tulane Studies in English, 8 (1958), 115-51: \"It seems a perversion of Hawthorne's scheme for the snake to enter the cavern of Elliston's bosom or heart from the fountain, and to return to the fountain when it leaves him. The fountain is usually treated as a way by which the inspiration of the unconscious depths of the heart emerge into consciousness; in which terms the snake, by going out of Elliston's bosom or heart and into the fountain, would not be changing its place at all\" (143). That the snake does re-enter the fountain is precisely the point, for the locus of inspiration, often imaged by a fountain which is in turn an image of the well\u00ad springs of the heart, is an intermixture. Only in \"The Hall of Fantasy,\" which is Hawthorne's realm of ideality, is the fountain \"pure.\" There the fountain exists, but the cavern of the heart does not.'

And despite Hawthorne's numerous use of such words as \"imaginative\" and his many descriptions of pottery and sculpture in the garden, no mention is explicitly made of the compositional process. Much of the language might suggest \"psychological\" readings of the tale.[] Baglioni and Rappaccini can oe viewed as father figures; and the student and the girl have an \"intimate and peculiar relationship\" (115). The language of religion is even more pervasive.[ '\"Religious\" readings include Roy R. Male, \"The Dual Aspect of Evil in 'Rappaccini's Daughter,\"' PMLA, 69 (1954), 99-109; Waggoner, (Hawthorne: and Richard Harter of Oklahoma Press, 1964), pp. 91-103).'] Beatrice is worthy to be worshipped; \"redeemed,\" she will cross \"the borders of Time\" and bathe \"in some fount of Paradise\" (126). But these vocabularies, we must remember, are translations of that which is \"unspeakable\" and \"indefinable\" in the garden. We may say of Hawthorne's works what [B.] Pasternak [1890-1960] writes about art in general: \"the clearest, most memorable and important fact about art is its con\u00ad ception, and the world's best creations, those which tell of the most diverse things, in reality describe their own birth[--Safe Conduct (1931 [?]; --New York: New Directions, 1958), II, 7o:r- Many of Hawthorne's best creations appear to be about a diver\u00ad sity of things, but they also describe stages in his compositional process. They are about their own birth, their own creation and the process that made them Hawthorne's imaginatiye progeny. Giovanni is not depicted as an artist, but his experiences parallel Haw\u00ad thorne's as an artist [i.e., in [ cf. tht:oat-level!]) \"may meet and each imbue itself with the nature of the other\" (ala Hawthorne); the 'Neutral Territory' is translation' must take place].

The second sequence of citations by the final critic in the section, one whose exploration o~ Hawthorne's process o~ composition places him {in terms of the present study} at the first s\u00b7tep of the scale of oral consonance, occurs immediately below. Drawn from earlier parts of the critic's study, that second succession of commentary again represents a present-century active response to Hawthorne's signature\u00ad Godhead, at the first step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of universal mouth with tongue and of writer's eternal somatic end-trails nosed into and out. It also represents an active response which (short of the systematic implication of a signatural serpent, and the discourse-remarking of its consonantally jointed an ever-ripening, ever\u00ad devolving, throat-to-lips rounded Haw as cosmic American laugh) comes the closest to the present study, in sensing out the articulatory or mouth-mimetic or oral-gestural (concept extended) ground which process--and in interpreting or con\u00ad symbolicizing that process as one of self-immortalizing name-singing, for purposes of privi-public possession (through verbal intrigue), of human territories, mind-memorial through mind-futuristic. The selected second succession of early commentary, presented in three 524 parts (again to sample qualities of critical ingression to the neutral but potentially potent middle division of articulatory topology, and now chiefly through \"My ,continued, \"neutral Hawthorne often spoke of his compositional process meta\u00ad phorically, as a journey to a region which he called the \"neutral territory.\" Where, we might ask, is that place to which Hawthorne mentally journeys to imagine his characters? What does this place look like? What happens when he is there? What is left behind when he leaves? What is the relationship between vision and revision? In attempting to answer these questions, this study explores Hawthorne's metaphor of the compositional process as it is revealed in his tales and The Scarlet Letter. By compositional process is meant not only the act of writing, but also the entire range of activities extending from the author's discovery of his idea for the work to the development of that idea into a mature work of art. Many of Hawthorne's fictions, this study argues, can be viewed as prophetic pictures or, to use another of Hawthorne's \u00b7 images, as mirrors upon which he projected his various artistic selves and thereby explored the workings of his imagination. Precisely how much it was Hawthorne's intention to compose allegories of composition will never be known[--'Authorial in\u00ad tention is, of course, always difficult to assess, but especially so with Hawthorne, in light of his numerous comments that he him\u00ad self was not often sure of the meaning of some of his fictions. Speaking of Michelangelo's painting of The Three Fates, Hawthorne wrote: \"Each man interprets the hieroglyp(h)ic in his own way; and the painter, put forth a riddle without himself knowing the solution. You can never be sure how much of the picture you yourself have made.\" ' (Riv. Ed., X, 331-32)]; nevertheless, a reading of his works as compositional allegories might illuminate our understanding of the creative process in general and of Haw- thorne's artistic method in particular. I I \"There are said to be temperaments endowed with sympathies so exquisite,\" Hawthorne remarks in \"A Book of Autographs,\" \"that, by merely handling an autograph, they can detect the writer's character with unerring accuracy, and read his inmost heart as easily as a less gifted eye would peruse the written page ([Cent. Ed., XI,] 376). A sympathetic temperament to which Hawthorne refers and the writer's character which that temperament explores could be one and the same. They could be Hawthorne's, for through his writing Hawthorne often studied his signatures, behind which lay \"the riddle 525 of his own existence\" ([CE,] X, 110). We shall consider much of Hawthorne's work as a book of autographs and \"gaze at this pro\u00ad duction of his pen as into his own inscrutable eyes\" ([XI,] 372-73). In reflecting upon and recoding his thoughts in his art, Hawthorne made of his works a mirror through which he could sustain an internal dialogue. Speaking of Monsieur du Miroir in the sketch of that name, the narrator remarks Hawthorne ex- tracts du Miroir from the chaos of mind by arresting him within the confines of Language and making him \"the picture or visible type of what . not know[--] I stone post\") I Arriving at the neutral territory is but one of Hawthorne's goals; successfully confronting what he sees there is another. The diversity of experience, the haunting array of phenomena, can be so disconcerting that it paralyzes all efforts to comprehend it. [' Thus Robin (of \"My Kinsman, Major Molineux\") carries with him to the city a brash confidence, a sense, as he believes, of his own shrewdness, and even perhaps an \"eager eye\" ([XI,] 210) with a capacity for vision. But in the city Rooin is uprooted and displaced. Like his sapling-staff he is cut off from something larger than himself which, he believes, provides him with power. In the city power belongs to others, and not unexpectedly the two staves Robin confronts there are wielded by men of authority. In the city, moreover, Robin encounters another forest, the bright and dancing wooden torches, which are also uprooted like Robin's cudgel but which dance in concert to a rhythm inexplicable and conduct a procession whose meaning he cannot know. Now, \"his eye not quite so lively\" (230), Robin grasps, as his sister did also, for some\u00ad thing rooted and sUbstantial. But he finds only a stone post, a funereal memorial to the death and dearth of his vision. I The stone post [=tongue! (A. K. V.)] stands across the street from what is perhaps, as Robin says, \"the very house I have been seeking\" (221). The occupant of the house is the man with the sepulchral \"hems\" and the polished cane, and he has (as the Major once had) authority. When Robin first sees the sepulchral man, his curious gutt(u]ral interjections are \"like the thought of a cold grave obtruding among wrathful passions\" (211). Last seen, his convulsive merriment manifests \"itself on his solemn old features, like a funny inscription on a tomb-stone\" (229-30). As this man, imaged by sepulchres, graves and tombstones, watches Robin, who stands by the church cemetery and clutches the stone post, the imagery of death suggests Robin's irrevocable loss. I What Robin loses, however, Hawthorne gains. The palimpsest of \"My Kinsman, Major Molineux\" 526 suggests a portrait of Hawthorne undertaking the interior journey to the neutral territory, there to imagine those fantastic pre\u00ad sences, his literary creations '] [--P. 16, R. Freed [1979], continued, \"sepulchral 'hem[ming]' I angle\") I Much has been made of the search for authority in '~y Kinsman\" but authority is pertinent to this discussion in terms of the author who seeks to command the authority only of his own visions and who attempts to contain the elusive nature of thought in a managable and, as much as is possible, in an unreductive manner. Of all the important characters in \"My Kinsman,\" only the man with the sepulchral \"hems\" attains the higher gro,und from which he can perceive, in the single flash of vision which is the recog\u00ad nition scene, \"a mass of people who hemmed the procession in\" (223; my italics). This higher ground exists from the window of the Gothic mansion which is not only, as Robin conjectures, the house he has been seeking but is also, presumably, the very house the Major has lost. That Robin's last name is never given may suggest that he and Hawthorne search not so much for Molineux himself, but for what Molineux was and for what the man of authority is: the \"visage . which [Robin] seemed to remember looking toward him from the Gothic [house's] window\" (223). A search for authority, \"My Kinsman\" is also a search for a home. Not only for a homeland, as some critics maintain,[] but also for the house of fiction whose window opens upon the world of the mind and provides the proper angle of vision from which the author is able to hem and stitch the mind's various textures into the tightly woven fabric of his text.

As sampled response most compatible with the approach taken to Hawthorne's literary art in the present study, the commentary by Richard Freed (1979) has appropriately served both to consummate and to terminate the select, possibly tendentious presentation made above (i.e., in this, the first section of chapter development), of a study\u00ad gradient reinforcing, study-vantages enhancing, critically living portrait of the signatural Hawthorne--voice hovering within an oral paradigm, both for pleasures of substantial meaning and for privilege of trans-substantial pathways to infinite life. The citation of four of the twentieth-century reflectors of the speech-chained Hawthorne will be resumed at points of advantage below (i.e., in the second and third sections of chapter development); the citation of Kenneth Dauber (1977), for reasons given, and of John Irwin (1980), J.

It constitutes a choice trans-national portrait of the signatural Hawthorne as oral self- encoder--as arch-Hawl to-ripeness-roller, over select paper-graphic landscapes of then stinting feed-back from: the archegonium reads as in draconic-appetitive, conflict-squeeze, diction. Hawmechanique tags initially-recapitulate frame remarks and specify the Period Godhead-re-envaulting author sampled, then stand in lieu of further frame remarks, while continuing to specify the succession of authors sampled. Those authors are a historically and nationally and functionally variegated lot, serving presently as a humanistic universe, to reinforce the idea of American Godhead in deep\u00ad back Haw-vault, ripening round in the nineteenth-century human world, to lip-bursting formal-ambivalent closure.) \u00b7529 The initial commentary sampled immediately below is an excerpt from a prefatorial text by Hawthorne himself, or a text in which the literary artist functions as his own self-penetrating, works re-facing, and type-line veiled editor.

The selected commentary reads as follows: HAWMECHANIQUE 110-;-N. Hawthorne [1846], \"pen I green within I Glan[ds] back\") And now, I begin to feel--and perhaps should have sooner felt-\u00ad that we have talked enough of the old Manse. Mine honored reader, it may be, will vilify the poor author as an egotist, for babbling through so many pages about a moss-grown country parsonage, and his life within its walls, and on the river, and in the woods,--and the influences that wrought upon him, from all these sources. My con\u00ad science, however, does not reproach me with betraying anything too sacredly individual to be revealed by a human spirit, to its brother or sister spirit. How narrow--how shallow and scanty too--is the stream of thought that has been flowing from my pen, compared with ' the broad tide of dim emotions, ideas, and associations, which swell around me from that portion of my existence! How little haye I r !. ~ : 530 told!--and, of that little, how almost nothing is even tinctured with any quality that makes it exclusively my own! Has the reader gone wandering, hand in hand with me, through the inner passages of my being, and have we groped together into all its chambers, and examined their treasures or their rubbish? Not so. We have been standing on the green sward, but just within the cavern's mouth, where the common sunshine is free to penetrate, and where every footstep is therefore free to come [italics--A. K. V.]. I have appealed ~o no sentiment or sensibilities, save such as are diffused among us all. So far as I am a man of really individual attributes, I veil my face; nor am I, nor have ever been, one of those supremely hospitable people, who serve up their hearts delicately fried, with brain-sauce, as a tidbit for their beloved public. Glancing back over what I have written [--\"The Old Manse: The Author Makes the Reader Acquainted with His Abode,\" CE, X (1974), 32-33.] The excerpt by the editorially self-penetrating Hawthorne presented directly above (as the initial text of the section) has served to illu- strate a prime, Period response, to belonging to public-through-private mind-space and to modern-through-ancient mind-time; and a response at the first step of the scale of oral consonance, as the level of universal mouth with tongue and of writer's eternal somatic end-trails nosed into and out (and now eyed motor-roundly back [i.e., at once into mouth cave and toward spine of book, mum mani- fold open to worldly reader]). The commentary which appears next and in successive citations below in the section has been drawn (as indicated previously in the sectional introduction) from texts diverse in historical, national, and: functional origins. That variegated chain of commentary, terminating in 531 Herman Melville's (1891) necro-elegy to Hawthorne, represents potential, active, and creatively reconstructive influences toward and responses to Hawthorne's self-incarnative conceptual habit(at) of being within-and- without his oral'dynamic signature-haw. Those influences and responses place themselves (i.e., here, in the present study) at the second, third, fourth and fifth (and strongly self-reasserting first) steps of the scale of oral consonance, steps potentially restatable as levels of oral '\u00b7 value (i.e., in the formulary manner of the frame remarks in the earlier critics' section, but now strongly eyed into consummable motor rounds, and potentially open to fulfilled world-figure correlations). In lieu of frame remarks stand the specification tags (properly developed from those head tags [and from the cont~xtual information in End Notes.S-8], frame remarks would immediately precede and follow each excerpt or set of excerpts, in the manner of the earlier,. critics' section and of the initial presentation in the immediate section). Marked by the economi- cal and heedworthy HAWMECHANIQUE specification tags, the second and successive selections of commentary read as follows: HAWMECHANIQUE 2/0--N. Hawthorne, continued [ca. 1819], \"back I This morning I saw at the grist-mill a solemn-faced old horse, hitched to the trough. He had brought for his owner some bags of corn to be ground, who, after carrying them into the mil~ walked up to uncle Richard's store, leaving his half-starved animal in the cold wind, with nothing to eat, while the corn was being turned to meal. I felt sorry, and nobody being near, thought it best to have a talk with the old nag, and said; \"Good-morning, Mr. Horse, how are you to-day?\" \"Good-morning, youngster,\" said he, just as plain as a horse can speak, and then said, \"I am almost dead, and I wish I was quite. I am hungry, have had no breakfast, and must stand here tied 532 by the head while they are grinding the corn, and until master drinks two or three glasses of rum at the store ,\"and the old creature cried--! almost cried myself not thinking much what I was doing, ran into the mill, and taking the four quart toll-dish nearly full of corn out of the hopper, carried it out and poured it into the trough before the horse, and placed the dish back before the miller came up from below. When I got out, the horse was laughing, but he had to eat slowly, because the bits were in his mouth. \"Thank you,\" said he, \"a luncheon of corn with the bits in is much better than none. The worst of it is, I have to munch so slowly, that my master may come before I finish it, and thrash me for eating his corn, and you for your kindness.\" I sat down on a stone out of the wind, and waited in trouble, for fear that the miller or the -owner of the corn would come and find out what I had 'done. At last the horse winked and stuck out his upper lip ever so far [note explicit face-and-mouth gestures (cf. step 5)--associated with deep in-stress of swallowing, at back of mouth (esp. as step 2)], and then said, \"The last kernel is gone;\" then he laughed a little, then shook one ear, then the other, then shut his eyes as if to take a nap. and then blew his nose exceedingly loud, but he did not wipe it; perhaps he had no wiper. I then asked if his master whipped him. now he has a white oak goad stick with an iron brad in its end, with which he jabs my hind [cf. back, haw] quarters, and hurts me [h+]awfully.\" I asked why he didnot-kick up, and knock his tormentor out of the wagon. \"I could only get my heels high enough to break the wiffletree, and besides lost my balance and fell down flat. Master then jumped down, and, getting a cudgel, struck me over the head, and I thought my troubles were over. The goad with the iron brad was in the wagon, and, snatching it out, I struck the end against a stone, and the stabber flew into the mill-pond. \"There,\" says I, \"old colt,\" as I threw the back in the wagon, \"he won't harpoon you aga~n with that iron.\" The poor old brute knew what I said well enough, for I looked him in the eye and spoke horse language. So he turned his long upper lip away back and laughed again, I thought a little exultingly. Very soon however, a tear came into his eye ... \" I have been hoping that I should die before snow fell; .. ,\"and the tears began to run again. At that moment the brute that owned the horse came out of the store and down the hill towards us. The meal was put in the wagon, the horse unhitched, the wagon mounted, the goad picked up, and a thrust made Looking at the end of his stick, the man bawled, \"What little devil has had my gourd?\" and then began striking with all his strength; but his steed only walked, shaking his head as he went across the bridge, and I thought I heard the ancient Equus say as he went, \"Thrash as much as you please; for once you cannot stab.\" I went home a little uneasy, not feeling 533 sure that the feeding the man's corn to his own horse was not stealing, and thinking that if the miller found it out he would / have me taken down before Squire Longley. [Mr. Lathrop copies part of the above extract in a sketch of his father-in-law, and says of it that \"it is the first instance on record of a mild approach of Hawthorne to writing fiction.\" Robinson Cook informs me that he recognizes the portraits of the hard master and the ill-used horse. (--Ed [1977], resumed, \"back poke horse language,n extension) At the very least, in Legends of the Province-House, an overarching psychic development that we shall follow, a movement from story to story in a sort of deep structure--perhaps genuinely hidden, perhaps, due to our present ignorance, but seemingly obscure-\u00ad recasts each of the American events presented as an element of a psychic regression thereby established at a national level. What appears,\u00b7 taken in itself, as stric~ly historical, becomes, in con\u00ad text, recreated as psychological as well. The phylogeny of the nation as a whole emerges, as it is retold at the inn, as the ontogeny of any one of the people in particular, and the ontogeny, so far from being strictly personal, is informed with nationality. \"Howe's Masquerade,\" then, locates us at the threshold of a double crisis. The staircase, appropriated by a rebellious new generation from the governors who once walked it, is lined with columns of the phallic order, \"quaintly twisted and intertwined pillars, from top to bottom,\" as Hawthorne says. It is problematical how oevertly Oedipal this language is. But the staircase revolution, at however deep a 1evel, is thus cast in a psychological light. George Washington is both a political figure and a son rebelling against a castrating father. He possesses a \"sword of immense lon\u00ad gitude,\" but the British masquers, in defense of their own power, represent it in their pageant as \"rusty.\" His army flourishes in full potency outside the walls of the Province-House, but is con\u00ad ceived inside as \"rent and tattered by sword, ball, or bayonet.\" In retaliation, and in psycho[-]military terms, Washington asserts himself. He announces his approach with \"the roar of artillery,\" smites the governor with \"the deep boom of the cannon.\" An histor\u00ad ical-genital conflict at the doors of the Province-House ushers us to the Oed~pal edge of childhood. I [--Pp. 70-71.] 534 And, K. Dauber [1977], \"back poke horse language,\" ext., continued) Once, again our psychological interpretation is bound to its relation to the historical, is defined by its place in the movement of the tales as a whole. The phases of human growth, as ego psychologists like Erik Erikson, for example, have emphasized, are not simply the result of the stages that preceded them, but must be.understood as they contribute to the child's end in a mature individual, his integration into the adult world.[ 'See, e.g., \"Identity and the Life Cycle,\" Psychological Issues, I, No. 1 (1959). Also, Childhood and Society, 2nd ed. (New York: Norton, 1963).'] In Legends, however, the end is reconceived. The Oedipal conflict of \"Howe's Masquerade,\" indeed, is the opposite of a preparation for manhood. So far from coming to terms with genitality, it rejects the genital in favor of an earlier sexual state. The coprological symbolism of corpses and lopped limbs, indeed--the wastes of the body, its rotted cast-offs-\u00ad is especially important. Genitally organized discourse is succeeded by the auto-intercourse of the anal stage. Central here is the dirty picture that hangs on the wall [i.e., in \"Edward Randolph's Portrait\"]--both dirty and fantastical, an ob]ectification outside the body of the magical power of excre\u00ad mental manipulation.[ 'See Norman 0. Brown, Life Against Death: The Psychoanalytic Meaning of History (1959; rpt. New York: Vintage, n.d.), p. 279. I rely heavily . on Brown's excellent \"Studies in Anality,\" pp. 177-304. '] I I Strictly speaking, in psychoanalytic terms, self-mothering should be at issue. Oppo\u00ad sition to the father awaits in the future. The child's asser\u00ad tion of self-creativity is a reaction, instead, to the pre-Oedipal or primal mother. We have maintained throughout, however, the power of the work precisely to reconstruct the psyche. Indeed, psychoanalysis itself assumes--though it has only begun to investi\u00ad gate the theoretical implications of its assumption--such a recon\u00ad struction in the psychoanalytic situation.[ 'Especially notable is the pioneering work of Jacques Lacan, which is becoming in\u00ad creasingly influential in literary analysis. A valuable bibliog\u00ad raphy may be found in Anthony Wilden, trans., The Language of the Self: The Function of Language in Psychoanalysis (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1968).'] The order of the stories in Legends of the Province-House, based on, but reversing, the natural order of human development, creates us, out of our own associations, anew. [--Pp. 71-74, poke horse language,\" extension) Many learned men have been of the opinion that throughout the radical words of all languages, there may be traced some degree of correspondence with the object signified. With regard to moral and intellectual ideas, they remar~, that in every language, the terms significant of them, are derived from names of. sensible objects to which they are conceived to be analogous; and with regard to sensible objects pertaining merely to sight, they remark, that their most distinguishing qualities have certain radical sounds appropriated to the expression of them, in a great variety of languages. Stability, for instance, fluidity, hollow\u00ad ness, smoothness, gentleness, violence, &c. they imagine to be painted by the sound of certain letters or syllables, which have some relation to those different states of visible objects, on account of an obscure resemblance which the organs of speech are capable of assuming to such external qualities. By this natural mechanism, they imagine all languages to have been at first con\u00ad structed, and the roots of their capital words formed.* [*The author who has carried his speculations on this subject the far\u00ad thest, is President Des Brosses, in\u00b7his \"Traite de la Formation . Me~h]anique des Langues.\" Some of the radical letters or syllables which he supposes to carry this expressive power in. most known languages are, St, to signify stability or rest; Fl, to denote fluency; Cl, a gentle descent; R, what relates to rapid motion; C, to cavity or hollowness, &c. A century before his time, Dr. (John] Wallis in his Grammar of the English Language [Oxford, 1653 (italics--A. K. V.)] had taken notice of these significant roots, and represented it as a peculiar excellency of our tongue, that beyond all others, it expressed the nature of the objects which it named, by employing sounds sharper [cf. thornier (A. K. V.)], softer, weaker, stronger, more obscure, or more stridulous, according as the idea which is to be suggested requires. He gives various examples. Thus, words, formed upon St, always denote firmness and strength, analogous to the Latin sto; as stand, stay, staff, stop, stout, steady, stake, stamp, stallion, stately, &c. Words beginning with Str, intimate violent force and energy, analogous to the Greek .. [stronnumi]; as, strive, strength, strike, stripe, stress, struggle, stride, stretch, strip, &~. Thr, implies forcible motion; as throw, throb, thrust, Wr obliquity wrong, wrangle [w]rath, wrack, &c. Sw, silent agitation, or lateral motion [cf. hypnotic ego-serpent of N. H. (--A. K. V.)]; as, sway, swing, swerve, sweep swim. Sl, a gentle fall or less observable motion; as in slide, slip, sly, slit, slow, slack, sling. Sp, dissipation or expansion; as spread, sprout, sprinkle, split, spill, spring. Terminations in ash indica~e 536 something acting nimbly and sharply; as crash, gash, rash, rash, flash, lash,\u00b7slash. Terminations in ush, something acting more obtusely and dul~y; as crush, brush, hush, gush, blush. The learned author produces a great many more examples of the same kind, which seem to leave no doubt, that the analogies of sound have had some influence on the formation of words. At the same time, in all speculations of this kind, there is so much room for fancy to operate, that they ought to be adopted with much caution in forming any general theory. [\u00b7' []Vid. Plat . Blair [1762;1850], \"back poke horse language,\" ext., continued) The advantages of writing above speech are, that writing is both the more extensive, and a more permanent method of communi\u00ad cation. More extensive, as it is not confined within the narrow circle of those who hear out words, but, by means of written characters, we can send our thoughts abroad, and propagate them through the world; we can lift our voice, so as to speak to the most distant regions of th~ earth. More pe~nent also; as it prolongs this voice to the most distant. ages; it gives us the means of recording our sentiments to futurity, and of perpetrating the instructive memory of past transactions. It likewise affords this advantage to such as read, above such as hear, that, having the written characters before their eyes, they can arrest the sense of the writer. They can pause, and revolve, compare, at their leisure, one passage with another: whereas, the voice is fugitive and passing; you must catch the words the moment they are uttered, or you lose them for ever. But, although these be so great advantages of written language, that speech, without writing, would have been very inadequate for the instruction of mankind; yet we must not forget to observe, that spoken language has a great superiority over written language, in point of energy or force. The voice of the living speaker, makes an impression on the mind, much stronger than can be made by the perusal of any writing. The tones of voice, the looks and gestures, which accompany discourse, and which no writing can convey, render discourse, when it is well managed, infinitely more clear, and more expressive, than the most accurate writing. For tones, looks, and gestures, are natural interpreters of the sentiments of the mind. They remove ambiguities; they enforce impressions; they operate on us by means of sympathy, which is one of the most powerful instruments of persuasion. Our sympathy is always awakened more, by hearing the speaker, than by reading his works in our closet. Hence, 537 though writing may answer the purposes of mere instruction, yet all the great and high efforts of eloquence must be made by means of spoken, not written language. [--Pp. 77-78.] HAWMECHANIQUE 2/0--D. Brewster [1832;1836], \"back poke horse language,\" extension) Towards the end of the seventeenth century a bold and almost successful attempt was made to construct a talking automaton. In the year 1779, the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg proposed as the subject of one of their annual prizes an inquiry into the nature of the vowel sounds, A, E, I, 0, U, and the con\u00ad struction of an instrument for artificially imitating them. This prize was gained by M. Kratzenstein, who showed that all the vowels could be distinctly pronounced by blowing through a reed into the lower ends of the pipes of the annexed figures, [i.e.,] as shown in Fig. 47 [ ],where the corresponding vowels are marked on the different pipes. The vowel I is pronounced by merely blowing into the pipe ab of the pipe marked I, without the use of a reed. About the same time that Kratzenstein was engaged in these researches, M. Kempelen of Vienna, a celebrated mechanician, was occupied with the same subject. In his first attempt he produced the vowel sounds, by adapting a reed R, Fig. 48, to the bottom of a funnel-shaped cavity AB, and placing his hand in various positions within the funnel. This contrivance, however, was not fitted for his purpose; but after long study, and a diligent examination of the organs of speech, he contrived a hollow oval box, divided into portions attached by a hinge so as to resemble jaws. This box received the sound which issued from the tube connected with the reed, and by opening and closing the jaws, he produced the sounds A, 0, OU, and an imperfect E, but no indications of an I. After two years' labour,, he succeeded in obtaining from different jaws the sounds of the consonants P, M, L, and by means of these vowels and consonants he could compose syllables and words, such as mamma, papa, aula, lama, mula. The sounds of two adjacent letters, however, ran into each other, and an aspiration followed some of the consonants, so that instead of ~ the word sounded phaa-E\u00a3-a; these difficulties he contrived with much labour to surmount, and he found it necessary to imitate the human organs of speech by having only one mouth and one glottis. The mouth consisted of a funnel or bell-shaped piece of elastic gum, which approximated, by its physical properties, to the softness and flexibility of the human organs.* [*Had M. Kempelen known the modern discovery of giving caout-chouc any degree of softness, by mixing it with moisture from the atmosphere, he might have obtained a still more perfect imitation of the human organs.] To the mouth-piece was added a nose made of two tin tubes, which communicated with.the 538 mouth. When both these tubes were open, and the mouth-piece closed, a perfect M was produced, and when one was closed and the other open, an N was sounded. M~ Kempelen could have succeeded in obtain\u00ad ing the four letters D, G, K, T, but by using a P instead of them, and modifying the sound in a particular manner, he contrived to deceive the ear by a tolerable resemblance to these letters [i.e., sounds]. There seems to be no doubt that he at last was able to produce entire words and sentences, such as, opera, astronomy, Constanti- . nopolis, vous etes mon ami, je vous aime tou mon coeur, venez avec moi a Paris, Leopoldus secundus, Romanorum imperator semper Augustus, &c.; but he never fitted up a speaking figure, and probably being dissatisfied with the general result of his labours, he exhibited only to his private friends the effects of the appara\u00ad tus, which was fitted up in the form of a box. The box was rectangular, and about three feet long, and was placed upon a table and covered with a cloth. When a particular word was mentioned by the company, M. Kempelen caused the machine to pronounce it, by introducing his hands beneath the cloth, and apparently giving motion to some parts of the apparatus. Mr. Thomas Collinston, who had seen this machine in London, mentions in a letter to Dr. Hutton, that he afterward saw it atM.

He says: \"Yet, in the 539 languages radically distinct, we shall find that the sounds or names which stand for the same objects have generally no similarity what\u00ad ever; whence it follows irresistibly, that nothing in the laws of voice or sound has determined the names adopted.\" This conclusion is drawn so irresistibly by means of the mistake that Dr. Bushnell, with many famous etymologists, has made, of conceiving \"no similarity whatever\" in words, except in their sound, ~\u00b7 their similarity of effect on the ear. It is very true, as he says, \"No theory of sound, as connected with sense, in the names of things, will be found to hold extensively enough to give it any moment;\" although, \"when sounds are the objects named, they will very naturally be imitated, as in hoarse and hiss.\" But words should be considered not merely as sounds, but as articulations of sound. The discovery and first principle of [C. Kraitsir,] the author of the \"Significance of the Alphabet[,]\" is, that words are to be considered, not merely or chiefly by their effect on the ear, but in the process of their formation by the organs of speech. Looked at in this point of view, words may be identified at once, although they may sound differently from each other, as garden and hortus and wirta and ogrod and zahrada. And this is the great idea in which lies a revolution not only for the treatment of philology itself, but for the method of intercommunicating the knowledge of all particular languages, and of ~lucidating all sciences communicable by words. I I Indeed, from him might be expected the realization of that idea of a lexicon which Herder has sketched in his \"Conversa\u00ad tions on the Spirit of Hebrew Poetry.\" One of the interlocutors of the conversation asks,--after having granted, with respect to the Hebrew, \"the symbolism of the radical sounds, or the utterance of the feeling that was prompted, while the object itself was present to the senses; the sound of the feelings in the very intuition of their causes:--But how is it with the derivations from these radical terms? What are they but an overgrown jungle of thorns, where no human foot has ever trod? \"EUTYPHRON. \"In bad lexicons this is indeed the cas~, and many of the most learned philologists of Holland have rendered the way still more difficult by their labors.

The root of the mother-word will stand in the centre, and around her the grove of her children. By influence of taste, diligence, sound sense, and the judicious comparison of different dialects, lexicons will be brought to distinguish what is essential from what is accidental to the sig\u00ad nification of words, and to trace the gradual process of transition; 540 while in the derivation of words, and the application of metaphors, we shall behold the invention of the human mind in its act, and more fully understand the logic of ancient figurative language.

(See my II.B.3.b.v and a perfect ANAGRAM [Edinburgh, 1711] ANAGRAMS are Names turned, because they are Inversions of Letters so transposed, that without any Adjunction, Repetition or Diminution of others than these which are in the Name and Sirname of a Person, there is a Devise or Period perfectly made up in Sense; and the Orthography must be strictly observed, if it be not for Excellency, that this Rule is dispensed with. The oldest Example that we have, is in Lycophron, of the Name of Ptolemy, King of Egypt, and of the Queen Arsinoe's Name But as the Spirit of Man is more prone to Evil than Good, ordinarily Men use to make Anagrams rather on Vice than Virtue. The Beginning of Anagrams is very old: It is likely, they have their Original from' the Hebrews, who not only had Names in great Veneration and Respect, but the Letters of Names, and the Mysteries of the Cabalists are vailed up in Letters, from whom the Grecians had them. 1. In an Anagram there must not be fewer nor more other Letters, but the same, and as many as in the Name. I \u00b7 541 2. the Omission of one or more is pardonable; especially for some excellent sense that agreeth to the Person, as in that of Auratus PIERRE DE RONSARD. ROSE DE PINDARE, of four R's, two are omitted. 3. A Letter may easily be omitted, without whose Help, the Name by it self may stand; as H, which placed behind, after Con\u00ad sonants, seemeth not much to alter the Power of the Name; which Letter some of the Latins have abolished, thinking it rather an Aspiration .. than_ a Letter. 4. [I]f there be any great Reason, a Letter may be added as relligio, repperit; or rather a Letter may be doubled, as when two letters occur in the Name, one may be abolished, so one of Necessity may be doubled. 5. All Diphthongs may be separated per Diaresin, and even so, two Vowels per Synaresin, may be conjoined, which Auratus practiced in the Name ors' S. [? 1 [ 6.] .. So some think, the Diphthong being forgot, we may use and take only the last and founding Letter: But, for the most part, we must keep Orthography, as it is vulgarly and by approved authors used; and if we adjoin a Letter, let us add one of these which make up the Name, that we seem not so much to have adjoined one, as doubled it. So a Jesuit doubled the Letter S, in the Anagram of Ignatius de Loyola; Q ignis turn'd it, Lita anguis 7. If it be asked, Whether adjecting or omitting be more to be tolerated? I answer, Adjecting; for so by Nature we are pre\u00ad pared rather to take, than have any Loss. 8. It is sometime lawful to change one Letter into another, That is, for one Letter to put another, which is the admitting of one, and omitting of another: Yet, I would think, these Letters must be such as may change into others, as D. into T. which the Spaniards use in the Latine ~ for Cato. - - 9. A double Letter, not unhappily, may be changed into a simple, as z. into S. I would say, divided as Z into S D. 10. But the Conclusion is, The Anagrammatism is so-much the more perfect, the farther it be from Licence. 11. The Definition says, Alicujus nominis, which is to be understood of proper Names, yet not only in Persons, but in Names of other Things, may an Anagrammatism be made. By Name, here is to be understood generally the Sirname, Fore-name, affixed Name, as Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus; or the Name of any Dignity. 12. Ye may use one Name, as Valesius, Laus Jesu; for many Nations have but one Name, but oftener the Name and Sirname are turned. 13.

I [--The Works , p. 230. bilingual Rose[]\") The name Champollion appears in some of the most important literary works of the American Renaissance--Emerson's to name a few. Yet for most modern readers, it is a name that requires an identifying footnote. Jean-Fran;ois Champollion was the Frenchman who, in the 1820s, deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphic writing with the aid of the bilingual text of the Rosetta stone-- a discovery that marked the beginning of modern Egyptology. Yet surely that piece of information provokes another question. Why would Champollion be mentioned in works as seemingly remote from his achievements as Thoreau's account of a stay at Walden Pond or Melville's story of the hunt for a white whale? That Europe and America, during the period 1800-50, were swept by a wave of interest in the antiquities of Egypt is nowadays one of the less well remem\u00ad bered facets of nineteenth-century history.[] When Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798, he was accompanied by a group of 150 scientists and artists (mostly from the Academie des Inscriptions) whose task was the investigation of the conquered territory. With the surrender of the French army in Egypt (1801), the British claimed as spoils of war all the antiquities gathered by the French scientists. Among these antiquities was the Rosetta stone, which arrived in England in February 1802. By 1806 a soldier of fortune named Mohammed Ali had forced the Turks to recognize him as pasha of Egypt, and during his long reign he encouraged the competition between the French and English agents d'art operating in his country, a competition that resulted in the flooding of Europe and then America with every shape and form of Egyptian artifact. In a tone at once Olympian and Yankee, Edward Everett remarked in The North American Review (1823), \"Since the days of the Romans, who plundered Egypt of obelisks and trans\u00ad ported whole colonnades of marble pillars from Italy to Constanti\u00ad nople, this magnificent kind of robbery never flourished more than at the present moment[\"--\"The Zodiac of Denderah,\" North American Review 17 (1823), 233.] At the time Everett wrote, the Egyptian revival in America was just beginning. [--P. 3, w. n. 3, adapt.] HAWMECHANIQUE 2-5/3--M. Quilligan [1979], on bilingual Rose,\" Conceit, Edwin Honig points to an \"allegorical\" device\u00b7 which he \"threshold image,\" \"emblem,\" \"sym\u00ad bol[\"--Dark Conceit: The Making of (New York: Oxford Univ. 543 Press, 1966), p. 72.] For, instance, in the opening scene of The Scarlet Letter, which presents Hester standing next to a wild rosebush at the prison door, wearing a scarlet letter, and holding Pearl in her arms, is one such threshold emblem. As Honig explains, the red rose, a traditional symbol for sexual passion, ustates\" the erotic relationship between Hester and Dimmesdale; the scarlet letter merely \"completes\" .the meaning of the rose. \"It is as if the emblem of the rosebush introduced a fearful indeterminacy which the emblem of th~.scarlet letter subsequently clarifies and gives full meaning to.\" The word \"threshold\" Honig took from the text. At the opening of the narrative, Hawthorne asks the reader to view the scene care\u00ad fully: Finding that rosebush, he writes, \"so directly on the threshold of our narrative, which is now about to issue from that inauspicious portal\" of the prison, \"we could hardly -do otherwise than pluck one of its flowers and present it to the reader. It may serve, let us hope, to symbolize some sweet moral blossom, that may be found along the track, or relieve the darkening close of a tale of human frailty and sorrow[\"--The Scarlet Letter, ed. Harry Levin (Boston: Houghton, 1960), p. 50.] More than an emblem for sexuality, the rosebush becomes a signal for the reader to begin looking for a moral, and to begin reading allegorically. Having specifically asked the reader to remember the blossom, Hawthorne later uses it to focus the reader's respdnse to Pearl. I When Pearl suggests she has been plucked off the rosebush, her remark refers not to something which [had] happened in the narrative but to something [which] the author had said [as author directly] to the reader. Her remark connects, then, not with an event in the imagined narrative (no character equates rosebush with moral) but with the text and specifically with the self-consciously metaphorical and allegorical nature of that text. Hawthorne treats the initial episode less as a threshold scene, or image, or symbol (none of which terms sufficiently emphasizes the verbal nature of the connections)[,] than as a threshold text, just as Spenser's wordplay constant1y focuses on the verbal details of the opening text, \"Of Court[,] it seems[,] men courtesy do call[\"--The Faerie Queene, Book VI.] I Forgetting for a moment the letter ['the most immediately signifying detail in the opening scene'] as a physical object we should ask, is the word \"letter\" a pun? To answer this question we must look at Hawthorne's methods a little more closely. The women collected outside the prison awaiting Hester's appearance argue about this letter. One charitable woman offers the comment, \"Let her cover the mark as she will, the pang of it will be always in her heart,\" while another (whom Hawthorne tells us is the \"ugliest\") exclaims\".... This woman has brought shame upon us all, and ought to die. Is there not law for it? Truly there is, both in the Scripture and the statute-book\" (p. 53). I Lest the reader miss this pivotal reference to the law, to legal-544 ity, to scripture, and to statute books, Hawthorne delays the introduction of Hester; it is not, in fact, Hester who first issues forth from the portal, but the town beadle I I The letter is, in fact, mute as to its meaning. The ultimate ambiguity of the letter's meaning is Hawthorne's final gift to the reader. The letter \"A\" belies interpretation, if only for [the] many different meanings [which] are offered. Melville, the ambiguous character of the hieroglyphics was their prime significance. The hieroglyphics were the linguistic analogue of an enigmatic external world whose shape was various enough to sustain almost any interpretation that man projected on it in the act of knowing. Both writers understood that questions of meaning were finally questions of value and that Champollion's scientific reading of the hieroglyphics had not rendered the nearly four centuries of metaphysical interpretations either worthless or meaningless. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, seventeenth-century metaphysical interpretations, and nineteenth\u00ad century scientific readings are in a sense all of equal value, in that each is a representative product of the ordering power of the human imagination in a different historical period. The sense that value and meaning are a function of historical process and that at any given moment in history man finds the truth he needs to find are insights that, in the works of Hawthorne and Melville, frequently center upon the image of the hieroglyphs. Certainly, it would be difficult to overestimate the impor\u00ad tance of the symbol of the hieroglyphics to the structure of a novel like The Scarlet Letter (1850). Hester's insignia is a hieroglyphic emblem, and the manuscript that accompanies it is its apparent explication--\"apparent\" because the very point of the novel is to present us not with the one true meaning of the hieroglyph but rather with a host of possible meanings from which to choose. In his first description of the scarlet letter, Hawthorne notes that the insignia is the product of a lost skill in embroidery, thereby emphasizing its mysterious, hieroglyphic nature: \"The stitch (as I am assured by ladies conversant with such mysteries) gives evi\u00ad dence of a now forgotten art, not to be recovered even by the process of picking out the threads\" ([Cent. Ed.,] 1:31). Gazing at the letter, he adds, \"Certainly, there was some deep meaning in it, most worthy of interpretation, and which, as it were, streamed forth from the mystic symbol, subtly communicating itself to my sensibilities, but evading the analysis of my mind\" (1:31). That \"deep meaning\" remains ambiguous to the last. 545 The scenario of multiple perspectives, in which an enigmatic object is variously interpreted by one individual whose point of view changes or by a series of individuals who each have a different point of view, is a major structural element in The Scarlet Letter. At the start a dual viewpoint is introduced into the very fabric of the narrative when Hawthorne presents himself not as the author of the story but rather as its revisor and elaborator. [ -Pp. 239-40. on Rose,\" extension) Ro\u00b7set~ta stone A piece of black basalt found in 1799 near the Rosetta mouth of the Nile, bearing a bilingual inscription (in hieroglyphics, demotic characters, and Greek), and famous as having given M. Champollion the first clew is an oval ring in hieroglyphic writing to set off the characters of a royal or divine name. The earliest exam\u00ad iners of the Rosetta stone had noticed that a group of characters enclosed in an oval appeared at a point in the hieroglyphic in\u00ad scription corresponding to the place where the name of the pharaoh Ptolemy Epiphanes occurred in the Greek inscription. The general surmise had been that these characters comprised the pharaoh's name and that the oval ring was an unvarying marker of royal names. Since the name Ptolemy was Greek in origin, the investigators reasoned that it must have been written phonetically in Egyptian, and they proceeded to isolate the name's phonetic elements in the demotic text of the Rosetta stone. Champollion, following the lead of earlier researchers like de Sacy, Akerblad, and Young, concentrated his efforts at decipherment on proper names and on establishing the relationship between demotic writing and the hieroglyphics. Having at first rejectea Young's contention that demotic writing was a cursive script ultimately derived from the hieroglyphics, Champollion finally accepted it; and in September 1822, working with copies of inscriptions from the temple at Abu Simbel, he deciphered the names.of the pharaohs Rameses and Thothmes. Champollion suddenly realized that phonetic signs were used for writing not only foreign names but Egyptian names as well, indeed that they were \"original and integral elements of the hieroglyphical system as such[\"--Erik Iversen, The Myth of Egypt 546 and Its Hieroglyphics in European Tradition (Copenhagen: Gee Gad, 1961), pp. 142-43.] It was this discovery that he announced [--Pp. n.

It is plainly an improve\u00ad ment upon speech, and therefore must have been posterior to it in order of time [note in Blair (as cited throughout this chapter) vacillating valuations of written over living speech]. At first, men thought of nothing more than communicating their thoughts to one another, when present, by means of words, or sounds, which they uttered. Afterwards, they devised this further method, of mutual communication with one another, when absent, by means of marks or characters presented to the eye, which we call writing. Written characters are of two sorts. They are either signs for things, or signs for words. Of the former sort, signs of things, are the pictures, hieroglyph[ic]s, and symbols, employed by ancient nations; of the latter sort, signs for words, are the alphabetical characters now employed by all Europeans. These two kinds of writing are generically and essentially distinct [vs. Champollion, 1822]. I I Among the Mexicans, were found some traces of hieroglyphical characters, intermixed with their historical pictures. But Egypt was the country where this sort of writing was most studied, and brought into a regular art. In hieroglyphics was conveyed all the boasted wisdom of their priests. According to the properties which they ascribed to animals, or qualities which they supposed natural objects to be endowed, they pitched upon them to be the emblems, or hieroglyphics, or moral objects; and employed them in their writing for that end. Thus, ingratitude was denominated by a viper; imprudence, by a fly; wisdom, by an ant; victory, by a hawk; a dutiful child, by a stork, a man universally shunned, by an eel, which they supposed to be found in company with no other fish. Sometimes they joined together two or more of these hieroglyphical characters; as a serpent with a hawk's head, to denote nature, with God presiding over it. [Italics--A. K. V.; cf. the rhythmically hawking master-signature posited in my I.B.3, lobes\") Hawthorn is the name given to the plant of the genus Crataegus of the Rosaceae, or Rose family. All Hawthorns are woody and more or less thorny. 548 \"Haw\" is a specific name for the fruit I I All Hawthorn flowers are perfect, i.e., they have both stamens and pistils, as is the case with other species of the Rosaceae. The calyx is a continuation of the structure of the receptacle and is split into 5 acute lobes, or sepals. The toothing of the calyx\u00ad lobes is an important diagnostic character. Inside the c~lyx is the corolla, consisting of 5 white petals. The size and shape of the petals are not regarded as a diagnostic chal'acter in this genus, but the width of the flower, measured between the extremi\u00ad ties of the petals, is an important character. Just inside the petals are the bases of the stamens, numbering 5 to 20 or more, depending on the species. In the center of the flower are 1 to 5 pistils. All the white corymbose tree flowers that you see in the woods in May and June belong to the Hawthorns. Also white are the race\u00ad mose flowers of the Serviceberry the umbellate flowers of the Inch Plum (Prunus lanata). The flowers of the very abundant Prairie Crab Apple (Malus ioenesis) are light pink. When the stigmas are fertilized by pollen from the anthers, the ovules start to.develop and become bony nutlets when the haws are ripe. The number of the nutlets is therefore about the same as the number of the pistils, but it averages slightly less because of the failure of some stigmas to be fertilized and the destruction of some pistils by insects. As flesh grows around the ovules or nutlets the remnants of the flower parts, viz, calyx, bases of filaments and styles, are pushed upward and become the apex of the haw. It is often possible as late as midsummer to get a good idea of the number of stamens on the flower by counting the bases of the filaments or noting their position with relation to the calyx\u00ad lobes. In some species most of the calyx-lobes are still persistent on the ripe haws, but in other species they have fallen. Crataegus is confined to the Northern Hemisphere and ranges through North America, Europe and Asia. It is most common in the eastern half of the United States. More than eleven hundred species have been published in the United States and about ninety in the Eastern Hemisphere. Nearly all the United States plants were described by c. S. Sargent, W. W. Ashe and C. D. Beadle. The period from 1899 to 1903 was a particularly busy one for the species makers.

Plutarch in his treatise De Iside et Osiride says that the Egyptians' \"philosophy is veiled in myths and in words containing dim reflexions and adumbrations of the truth In Sais the statue of Athena, whom they believe to be Isis, bore the inscription: 'I am all that has beeri, and is, and shall be, and my robe no mortal has yet uncov\u00ad ered.\"'[ 'Plutarch, Moralia, trans.

E. A. Wallis Budge, 2nd ed., (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1951), p. 95--]Plutarch adds: Not only the Nile, but every form of moisture they call simply the effusion of Osiris :. And by the picture of a rush they represent a king and the southern region of the world, and the rush is interpreted to mean the watering and fructifying of all things, and in its nature it seems to bear some resem\u00ad blance to the generative member. Moreover, when they celebrate the festival of the Pamylia which, as has been said, is of a phallic nature, they expose and carry about a statue of which the male member is triple; for the god is the Source, and every source, by its fecundity, multiplies what proceeds from it In fact, the tale that is annexed to the legend to the effect that Typhon cast the male member of Osiris into the river, and Isis could not find it, but constructed and shaped a replica of it, and ordained that it should be honoured and borne in processions, plainly comes round to this doctrine, that the creative and germinal power of the god, at the very first, acquired moisture as its substance ... (5:88-89) In the worship of Osiris, the phallus stood as a symbol of the god, part for whole, so that through the equation of phallus and body the rebirth of Osiris was ritually represented either by the ceremonial erection of the phallus or the erection of djed (a tree trunk with the stumps of branches projecting on either side at the top), a symbol of the god's backbone--vitality thus being indicated, in either phallic or bodily form, by the ability to stand upright, to rise from the dead. There are numerous instances in antiquity of the phallus as a mortuary monument symbolizing rebirth[--C. Kerenyi, Dionysos, trans.

Irwin (1980], \"toothing of the calyx-lobes,\" ext., continued) John Gardner Wilkinson's A second Series of the Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians (1841), which Whitman had apparently read, devotes some ninety pages to the cult of Isis and Osiris, with lengthy quotations from Plutarch, Herodotus, and Diadorus Siculus. Wilkinson discusses \"the phallic ceremonies, said to have been performed in honour of Osiris[\" ( I:342),] and after citing Plutarch's account of the statue of Osiris \"with the triple phallus,\" he quotes from Herodotus's description of the same ceremonies: \"!The Egyptians celebrate the rest of this festival nearly in the same manner as the Greeks ; but in lieu of phalli, they make little puppets about a cubit high, which women carry about the towns and villages, and set in motion by a string ' The historian then describes the appearance of these phallic figures, which he ascribes to a sacred reason; and it is a curious fact that similar puppets are made by the Egyptians on the occasion of public rejoicing at the present day\" (I:343-44). Wilkinson notes that the custom of applying \"the name of Osiris to both men and women, who were supposed to partake suffi\u00ad ciently of the qualities of the good being to be worthy of that honour, appears to have some connection with the Greek notion of Dionysus or Bacchus (who was thought to answer to Osiris) being both male and female\" (I:322). One of the mysteries that the cult of Isis and Osiris seems to have veiled from the uninitiated was the paradoxical reversibility of the divine nature whereby the god Osiris is the father without a phallus and the goddess Isis the mother with a phallus, a blurring of the male/female distinction not uncommon among deities of the vegetative cycle and consistent with a notion of divinity as undifferentiated. In Godfrey Higgins's Anacalypsis, An Attempt to Draw Aside the Veil of the Saitic Isis; ~' An Inquiry into the Origin of Languages, Nations, and Religions (1836), the imagery of the veil, the phallic cult of Isis and Osiris, and the concealed origin of language are woven into a single network. (The word \"anacalypsis,\" from the Greek ana, \"back or up,\" plus kalyptra, \"veil, covering for the head,\"\u00b7may be meant to suggest the botanical use of the word \"calyptra,\" meaning \"the remains of the female sex organ, or archegonium, of a moss or fern, forming the caplike covering of the spore case.\") Concerning the Egyptian worship of Osiris, Higgins notes: \"In their caves or the 55L adyta of their temples they annually, during the mysteries of Isis, celebrated the mysteries and tragical death of Osiris, in a species of drama, in which all the particulars were exhibited; accompanied with loud lamentations and every mark of sorrow. At his time his images were carried in procession covered, as were those in the temples, with black veils. On the 25th of March, exactly three months from his birth, his resurrection from the dead was cele brated with great festivities 281-83, w. nn. of [1981], metaphoric construct in Thoreau's philo\u00ad logical image of spring's resurrection is the equation of the thawing sand, the raw earth itself, with an organic vegetative force. The sand--here the reader must be alert to the dental, fricative sounds of which the word is made--represents what Kraitsir would have called \"dormant\" effect; it begins to flow like 1!!!\u00b7 Streams interlace until the reader does not know if he is looking at a living ~ystem or a live plant. Sappy leaves and vines appear as the thaw progresses; lichens are evoked, with their laciniated, lobed, imbricated thalluses. The dominant sounds become the liquid labials, the one sees a living organism that before was dead: Leopards' paws, birds' feet, lungs and bowels emerge as the earth stirs to life. But to Thoreau the sand foliage conjures yet another image, of the innards or bowels of the earth. He feels as though he stands in a cave flooded with light and later comments on the cast size of the \"sandy rupture.\" He thinks himself in the work\u00ad shop of God, as he overflowed himself, \"strewing his fresh designs about\" through an excess of energy. Here the reader witnesses nothing less than Thoreau's visionary metaphor for Creation: individual life struggling to put itself forth and, inevitably, fading again into the thin dentals and fricatives that denote death. The earth Thoreau sees is filled with living, flowing, running, moving energy and so labors with the idea of its streaming forms of life that it must everywhere project itself through the imagery of living things, in this case, leaves. The overhanging boughs become archetypal and are \"pregnant\" with the laws that all atoms contain within themselves. I [--Pp. 134-35; discus- sion, of Thoreau's 552 And, P.

The liquids press it forward, as they do over the entire globe, but all ends in those dental sounds--\"the symbols of death\" as Kraitsir called them: 1-e-a-f, g-1-o-b-e, 1-i-f-e.

The world is but a \"leaf\" and subject to the same laws. Towns and cities are but the \"ova of insects\" in the axils of this organism--an image calling to mind both Walden's last page, when the dormant grub emerges triumphant from the table after lying entombed for decades, and Kraitsir's injunction to the religious man, who must make it his ambition to \"trace the papillon of language, from the egg, through all the metamorphoses,\" until he reaches knowledge of the spirit[--Glossol., p. 197]. The railroad cut becomes nothing less than a parable of man's enti~e existence, and Thoreau makes the lesson explicit: \"this one hillside illus\u00ad trated the principle of all the operations of nature.\" The Creator of the world 11but patented a leaf\" (WP, p. 308). \"What Champollion will decipherthis hieroglyphic for us, that we may turn over a new leaf at last?\" What Champollion, in\u00ad deed, if not the curious Hungarian Charles Kraitsir and a handful of his New England disciples?

[Emerson's] tenet [of 'soul'-progress] I The hieroglyph repeated throughout nature and language not only displays the fact that (as Emerson and Reed had noted) words are coextensive with natural facts but, more importantly, that these natural facts are themselves the reality men have been chasing. The world of birth, change, and death is the ultimate secret to be read in organic nature, as well as in the highest mental activity of man, his language. Thoreau's insight was that life goes on and on in an unending cycle of constant change and that, while the individual organisms die, throughout nature the totality of existence is ever in the finest health. \"We are surrounded by a rich and fertile mystery,\" Thoreau elsewhere proclaimed. \"May we not probe it, pry into it, employ ourselves about it a little? (Wr, 8:471). By the \u00b7 time he wrote Walden, Thoreau had done just that and discovered the true Logos God had contained in the very nature of things. [--Pp. 135-37, w. parenth. identif. Walden (WP) character[]\") A papered chamber in a fine old farm-house, a mile from any other dwelling, and dipped to the eaves in foliage--surrounded by moun\u00ad tains, old woods, and Indian ponds,--this, surely, is the place to write of Hawthorne. Some charm is in this northern air, for love and duty seem both impelling to the task. A man of a.deep and noble nature has seized me in this seclusion. His wild, witch\u00ad voice rings through me; or, in softer cadences, I seem to hear it in the songs of the hill-side birds that sing in the larch trees at my window. Now, it is that blackness in Hawthorne, of which I have spoken, that so fixes and fascinates me. It may be, nevertheless, that it is too largely developed in him. But however this may be, this blackness it is that furnishes the infinite obscure of his back-ground,--that background against which Shakespeare plays his grandest conceits --'Off with his head; so much for Buckinghaml' This sort of rant, interlined by another hand, brings down the house,--those mistaken souls, who dream of Shakespeare as a mere man of Richard-the-Third humps and Macbeth daggers. But it is those deep far-away things in him; those occasional flashings-forth of the intuitive Truth in him; those short, quick probings at the very axis of reality;--these are the things that make Shakespeare, Shakespeare. Through the mouths of the dark characters of Hamlet, Timon, Lear, and Iago, he craftily says, or sometimes insinuates the things which we feel to be so terrifically true, that it were all but madness for any good man, in his own proper character, to utter, or even hint of them. Tormented into desperation, Lear, the frantic king, tears at the mask, and speaks the same madness of vital truth Truth is forced to fly like a sacred white doe in the wood\u00ad lands; and only by cunning glimpses will she reveal herself, as in Shakespeare and other masters of the great Art of Telling the Truth,--even though it be covertly and by snatches. Nor need you fix upon that blackness in him, if it suits you not ['this great power of blackness in him (which) derives its force from its appeals to that Calvinistic sense of Innate Deprav\u00ad ity and Original Sin, from whose visitations, in some shape or other, no deeply thinking mind is always and wholly free']; for it is, mostly, insinuated to those who best understand it, and account for it; it is not obtruded upon every one alike.

The two men saw each much of each other during the following year, and Melville celebrated their friendship by dedicating \u00a5oby Dick [1851] to Hawthorne. As enthusiastic as Melville's praise of Mosses is~ he came to prefer the Twice-told Tales. In 1851 he wrote to Duyckinck that the Twice-told Far exceed the 'Mosses'--they are, I fancy, and earlier vintage from his vine. Some of those sketches are wonderfully subtle. Their deeper meanings are worthy of a Brahmin. Still there is something lacking--a good deal lacking--to the plump sphericity of the man. What is that?--He doesn't patronise the butcher--he needs roast-beef, done rare.--Nevertheless, for one, I regard Hawthorne (in his books) as evincing a quality of genius, immensely loftier, & more profound, too, than any other American has shown hitherto in printed form.

HI\") In his symbolic romances Hawthorne began to utilize the concept of rhetorical ambiguity demanded by the moral complexity of\u00b7 his age, but his plots are resolved in ways that at times seem evasive. Like Emerson and Thoreau, he had developed an interest in questions of perce-tion and meaning that led him to investigate the bewildering variety of possible readings of such \"natural\" emblems as the scarlet A, the Pyncheon home, Hilda's dovecote, and Zenobia's flower. But, again like Emerson and Thoreau, Hawthorne always offered some point of secure anchorage (one might even say, of retreat) in a morally ambiguous world. This was not the case with his friend Herman Melville, who of all his contemporaries best understood the effects of the revolution in language and meaning that occurred when the centrifugal forces of romanticism were 555 unleashed in theology and philosophy both. As I already have sug\u00ad gested, Melville was more directly affected than Hawthorne by the crisis in religious and moral rhetoric that palsied his environment, and he overtly examined the problem of language and meaning in The Confidence Man [1852}. But we also must recognize that his master\u00ad piece, Moby Dick [1851}, offers readers an intense examination of what men might do once \"meaning\" had become, for all intents and purposes, a privately mediated affair between an individual and his conscience. The most self-consciously symbolic of Melville's major works, Moby Dick opens with nothing less than an \"Etymology\" of the word whale, \"supplied by a late consumptive usher to a grammar school\" who was \"ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars,\" a task he enjoyed because \"it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.\" From the outset, then, Melville intends to display how the word and the thing, and (to complete the Emersonian equation) the spiritual \"fact\" the whale represents, lend themselves to whole ranges of phonetic and symbolic interpretation. Indeed, as the first quotation <from \"Hackluyt\") in the \"Etymology\" suggests: \"While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the signification of the word, you deliver that which is not true[\"-\u00ad Herman Melville, Moby Dick; or, The Co., 1964), pp. 3-5.} Moby Dick, Then, is an investigation of the countless verbal and symbolic representations of the great white whale, and the different philo\u00ad sophical \"grammars\" the members of the Pequod's crew use to compre\u00ad hend the creature provide many varied readings of the \"text\" of the whale.

Hawthorne was enchanted by his new guest, but this enfant terrible was to prove somewhat of a Rimbaud to his Verlaine. I And Sophia, of course, was on the side of conformism and conventions. She would have had difficulty in understanding the exigencies of a contradictory sensibility in need of nourishment and sensations. It was this element of sensation that Melville was now providing: his enthusiasm, his rejection of conformism-\u00ad forcing the older man to \"swim for his life\"[]--his talent, even his affection: \"Whence come you Hawthorne? By what right do you drink from my flagon of life? And when I put it to my lips--lo, they are yours and not mine. I feel that the Godhead is broken up like the bread at the Supper, and that we are the pieces.\"[] From this paradisaic idea of brotherhood, Melville then goes on to declare his adoration of the \"archangel.\" [] Nathaniel is fot him what Sophia had been for Nathaniel: \"The divine magnet is on you, and my magnet responds. Which is the biggest? A foolish question-\u00ad they are One.\"[] This identification with his friend, his mystical sensuality, and the passionate tone of his protestations all seem to indicate a homosexual element in Melville's feelings, and the \"flagon\" is as much the symbol of some dark, Lethean draught as it is of eternal life. Did Hawthorne feel it his duty, as the Consul did later on when the drunken minister was brought to him,[] to deliver a sermon? Did he reply to the appeal of a \"damned soul\" with mere coldness?[] His nature, as we know, was such that he tended to stiffen and withdraw when his emotions were stirred. But it is a fair wager that he was afraid of yielding to pity, or to some even more fearful demon. It is certainly true that Oberon was always open to the temptation of an esthetically pleas\u00ad ing fate Hawthorne had long since imagined Oberon's return.[] It was in the peace of a settled home, in the somewhat tedious atmosphere of set habits and a circle of secure affections, that he was able tapursue his troubled dreams. [Melville's remarks from: 'Melville Viking Press, 452.'] [--N.H.: An Approach to an Analysis of Artistic Creation [his first literary] conversation with himself. The audience, prohibited from providing the matter of the tale, is invited to overhear it ... The two characters, whose conversa\u00ad tion is the tale, may be compared to any of several similar pairs in Hawthorne's work Oberon, Hawthorne's nickname in Bowdoin, which he used, as well, to sign several early, otherwise anonymous 558 stories,[j is a projection of his artistic side. The narrator, a man of society, and an imposition of the audience on a story that else would exclude it, is at first presented as arising but in reference to the asocial Oberon whom he inverts. The two produce each other. \"Oberon\" is \"a name of a fancy and friendship between him and me\"; it does not exist prior to their friendship. Similarly, the narrator's narrative propensities, \"a desire to turn novelist,\" as he puts it, develop only when he reads Oberon's manuscripts ([Cent. Ed.,] XI, 171). Hawthorne, before writing \"The Devil,\" has incorporated the audience into his own psyche. \"The Devil in Manuscript,\" then is a psychomachia, Hawthorne's ego in motion. It is the translation of a divided self into narra\u00ad tive. Its dialogue is bifurcated monologue. A s~ngle comment is given opposite meanings. The integrative faculty of 'the ego fails, as what it asserts is split into conflicting assertions. \"Would they were out of my sight!\" says Oberon of the manuscripts, think\u00ad ing how their reality haunts him. \"And of mine too\" (XI, 171), thinks the narrator; but because, he tells us later, he judges them very poor things. The structural basis of the story is a pun: \"[I was] privately of opinion,\" says the narrator, \"in spite of my partiality for the author, that his tales would make a more bril\u00ad liant appearance in the fire than anywhere else\" (XI, 173); at the climax of the tale, when the cause of the city's fire has been revealed, \"Here I stand--a triumphant author!\" says Oberon, \"Huzza! the town on fire! Huzza!\" (XI, 178). The narrator sets himself on the side of actuality. The metaphoric brilliance of Oberon's stories is denied by the literal brilliance they would produce in burning. But Oberon exalts the metaphor. For him metaphor replaces reality; the artistic creation envelops the city. I I Oberon, interrupting himself with the deprecating \"Pshaw,\" absorbs the narrator's' part as antithesis in the would-be dialectic and goes on to assert a synthesis in his punning resolution. The narrator, on the other hand, becomes pure spectator, asserting one meaning of the pun against the other, asserting the reality princi\u00ad ple against the claim of art as second reality.[ 'He tells a peculiar kind of joke. Simon 0. Lesser, Fiction and the Unconscious. (1957; rpt. New York: Vintage Press, 1962), p. 282, quotes Freud, Collected Papers, ed. Joan Riviere, V (London: Hogarth, 1950), p. 217: \"(Humor) signifies the triumph not only of the ego, but also of the pleasure principle, which is strong enough to assert itself here in the face of the adverse real circumstances.\" The narrator's pun, then, is anti-humor, asserting reality in the face of an adverse pleasure.'] He [the narrator] remains apart, watching the artist in what now seems an ecstasy, quite literally standing outside reality [in phallic/lingual over-run (A. K. V.)], performing extra-human feats, as \"with a wild gesture of exultation, he leaped almost to the ceiling of the chamber.\" The narrator moves .away 559 from the action, becomes one with the uninspired audience, and safely, sanely observes Oberon in the grip of a demonic \"frenzy\" (XI, 178). I [--Pp. 56-58, 59, w. n. 11 Dauber aware of Haw/Pshaw? How far? --For more I compounded'],\" ext.) I A mechanism of protection can be seen in the strategy of this tale [\"Devil 't] . Hawthorne, though he seeks intimacy, resists exposure. He presents himself divide~ against himself, mocking one half with another. As \"The Devil\" progresses, however, the division becomes so great it breaks down. Elements originally interacting, the one opposing the other, become simply unrelated. Hawthorne's art, ventured as an instrument of unification, yet excludes the very culture with which he would unite. The story, as a result, never evolves, but remains at the end what it was at the beginning, a simple projection. Not until \"Wakefield\" is there evidence of poetic faith in abundance. There, manifestly, art as an instrument of unification is at work. There[,] Hawthorne sets in motion a genuine conversation, not with himself, but with a reader he seeks to define, through art, in relation to himself. ['From a personal standpoint, unification with the city, with society, is a consummation that Hawthorne devoutly wished. For\u00ad mally speaking, it is a synthesis whose dialectic would articulate itself in the form of a story, like his best, compounded of self and other. But he has not yet that confidence in his art as an instrument effective for constructing intimacy '] year of [Omoo], he [Melville] married Elizabeth Shaw [ShAW!] the daughter of the chief justice of Massachusetts. For nearly three years he lived and wrote in New York (visiting London and Paris in winter 1849-50). Then he settled with his wife and first child--he was soon to be the father to two sons and two daughters--at Pittsfield, Massachusetts. While Hawthorne, a few miles away at Lenox, was writing The House of the Seven Gables, Melville was deep in Moby Dick, or The Whale, a book \"broiled,\" he told Hawthorne, \"in hell-fire.\" In this book Melville did for the South Seas and the whalers what Cooper had done for the frontier and Mark Twain was to do for the great age of the Missis-560 sippi steamboats. More important, he created a fine story, an unforgettable character [Ahab], an impressive wrestling with the problem of evil, and a rich, symphonic sterile'],\" extension) The American novel is from the beginning an experimental novel. It is literature taat, as writer after writer tells us, is unsure of its own usefulness, afraid to trouble the reader with reading it, ashamed to present itself as something significant. It is fiction that knows it is only fiction. But because it knows this as a birthright, as it were, as a condition of writing in a country that doubts the validity of writing, it goes far beyond the need of the\u00b7. contemporary novel to debunk itself. It is a novel debunked from the start, concerned not so much with its inability to be real, as with the uses to which its acknowledged unreality may be put. It is a self-conscious fiction, not a sterile one. It is only in self-conscious reading that we can avoid sterility ourselves. [--P. [T]he very circularity of our argument, here, is in keeping with the circularity of the Blithedale as a whole, Blithedale's redefinition of itself as a new kind of literature. Ideally, we should read every incident of Blithedale as a transfor\u00ad mation of every other. We may perform, that is. a formal analysis on it precisely because of that equality of all its elements which we have discussed. Here alone no purpose external to the work, struggling to impose itself on it, invests some incidents with special significance, contests others, fails to consider more. Here alone, in Hawthorne, the book exists independently ~ a form. We have called such a work realistic. It is a work that subsumes the forces that might otherwise impinge on it from the outside into its own neutrality. In Hawthorne it swallows even its beginnings, incorporates within itself the very influences that give .rise to it, transforms, in other words, its history into an ontology. Within its own compass[,] Blithedale, therefore, just stakes out afresh ground already broken in England and elsewhere. Indeed, it plays out in itself--because it absorbs its tradition 561 into itself--the development of English realism from English real\u00ad ism's own beginnings. Blithedale's characters, for eenth-century \"Character\": \"The self-concentrated Philanthropist; the narrow limi\u00ad tations of her sex; the weakly Maiden, whose tremulous nerves endow her with Sibylline attributes; the Minor Poet, beginning life with strenuous aspirations, which die out with his youthful fervor\" ([Cent. Ed.,] pp. 2-3). It is filled justifying quasi-biographical material Defoe used: \"Doctor Griswold--as the reader, of course, knows--has placed me at a fair elevation among our minor minstrelsy\" (p. 246). Here is an absorption of a poten\u00ad tial external cause--the writer: why he wrote the book or, in this case, his ability to write--within the fiction. Hawthorne must invent the mode all over again. I [--Pp. 165-66.] And, K. yet withdraw(n) purpose'],\" ext.) I There is a manifest concern with names. Hawthorne ration\u00ad alizes anew the realistic use common in eighteenth-century novel\u00ad ists, of names' symbolic meanings, as Ian Watt has demonstrated[ The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding (1957; rpt. Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1967), p. 19]. We note Hawthorne's own difficulty in finding a title for his book[ (see) Pearce, Centenary Edition, p. xix]. How may he give it a name yet withdraw purpose, maintain disinterest in the face of valuating the book with a name? The problem is projected onto the work. The community considers \"Sunny Glimpse,\" \"Utopia,\" and \"The Oasis,\" manifestly allegorical designations, so that when it settles on the equally allegorical \"Blithedale,\" it seems in contrast, as Coverdale says, \"neither good nor bad\" (p. 37). Or, alternatively, a natural name is 'forced to project mystic significance: \"Priscilla! Priscilla!\" says Coverdale, \"I repeated the name to myself, three or four times; and, in that little space, this quaint and prim cognomen had so amalgamated itself with my idea of the girl, that it seemed as if no other name could have adhered to her for a moment\" (p. 29). The symbolic name, the name that seems to suit the character of its bearer, while present and in no need of justi\u00ad fication in novelists writing after the early 1700's, must be brought in, here, by the back door. \u00b7 What has been taken as Hawthorne's occasional clumsiness, then, so far from exemplifying the comparative inability of a romancer in the territory of Richardson, Austen, and Eliot, is precisely a measure of his originality[. 'This has been a common criticism. See, e.g., the representative view of Robert C. Elliott, . , in Hawthorne Centenary Essays, p. 117 '] [Henry] James was right about the 562 alienation of the American artist, the absence in America of artistic community. It is his contribution to the founding of a new line, of which James himself was the illustrious successor, to have \"realized\" in Blithedale the pragmatical possibilities of American speech I kosmoi in a cosmos'],\" ext.) I It is not, however, the difficulty of maintaining neutral\u00ad ity that is Blithedale's problem. By and large it establishes a balance, and it is its very success in achieving it that is its largest failure. The negative side of neutrality is 'emptiness. There is a valuelessness about Blithedale, a deadness that replaces significance and that threatens every word written. Valuelessness is more than the theme of the book. It is a quality of the way in which the themes are perceived. Significance is a function of the use of the work, of the relation of author to the audience the work embodies. It is what generates meaning, as we have been using that term. Signification is a function of the message the work encodes. It is the relation, in linguistic terms, \u00b7between Saussure's signifier and signified. Of course, code and use act on each other as a means delimiting an end, an end informing a means. But they may, and in realism do, come close to dissociation. Value\u00ad lessness, in effect, results when the message has no use. [See my LEnd Notes.l3(a), on \"illusory\" haw.] There is a remarkable'sign' that appears two or, perhaps, three times in the book and to no immediately evident end. As Coverdale looks across from his hotel room to the neighboring boarding-house in which Zenobia and Priscilla will shortly take up residence, he notices a dreary and forlorn dove in one of its dormer windows: I \" I wondered why she chose to sit there, in the chilly rain, while her kindred were doubtless nestling in a warm and comfortable dove-cote. All at once, this dove spread her wings, and launching herself in the air, came flying so straight across the int.ervening space, that I fully expected her to alight directly on my window\u00ad sill. In the latter part of her course, however, she swerved aside, flew upward, and vanished, as did like-wise the slight, fantastic pathos with which I had invested her\" (p. 152). [=Signature V'VI graph-memo 1 ] I I The chief action of the dove, indeed, would seem to serve as a connective. It links two chapters. [T]he dove is a particular kind of musical end [='note()'], a close on the dominant rather than on the tonic. I The situation is not unlike what we find in later works of American literature, called naturalistic[,] but that we would call realistic[, in] the stories of Crane and certain parts of the early novels of Norris. For 563 Crane and Norris the progress of history neutralizes the work in much the same way that the progress. of Hawthorne's art .neutralizes it for him.

He enclosed himself within it and then, within. its 567 walls, sought to perpetuate the movements of the inward life, the cyclical movements whose recurrences had the character of a private fatality, and of which Hawthorne's individual psychology and even his ethics bore the stamp. For Hawthorne, creation in utero was more than an artistic necessity: it was a psychological, almost a physical need. To recreate the conditions of creation also meant, for him, to make his way back to the original maternal refuge, to the womb--which made him a child-creator, sheltered by the womb within which he deployed all his adult powers and resources. This was why he persistently sought to identify himself with the mother, to lose himself inside her: an attempt that would have doomed his talent to failure if the memory of the father had not also been present to disturb his Lethean quietude--for the \"haunted\" mind, androgynous in its complex combines qualities masculine androgynous Orlando'], transformed itself into a womb in order to perpetuate its creative principle, which was not exclusively male, as the descendant of the great Puritans would have wished, so that the artist was always prone to blame himself tor his lack of participation in the divine work,[] for his failure to continue it[--cf. G. Poulet's notion of 'continuous creation'--]as his forefathers had attempted to do. But for Hawthorne, deprived of his father so early, God was a distant being and as if absent from his creation, aloof in an eternity whose threshold there could be no daring to cross[: \"The Procession of Life\"--\"!... And whither! We know not; and Death our leader, deserts us by the wayside . \"; also, (there is) Dimmes\u00ad dale' s reticence ( [Riv. Ed. , ] V, 303-4 ). '] As the artist in his inward sphere awaited the arrival of his characters, so God in his infinity awaited the souls of men. But at no point did the two spheres overlap. Communication could take place only through intercessors, though angels--through women. But did the female Christ, whether Hester or Hilda, fulfil her mission? Haw\u00ad thorne returned to his solitude, to his fertile doubts. The artist's work is i work apart, one that must be sufficient unto itself, that must redeem itself and redeem its author. [--Pp. 158- knitting all his force, got one hand free, Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine, That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine. 568 XX Therewith she spewd out of A floud of poyson horrible and blacke, Full of great lumps of flesh and gobbets raw, Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke His grasping hold, and from her turne him backe: Her vomit full of bookes and papers was, With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke, And creeping sought way in the weedy gras: Her filthie parbreake all the place defiled has. XXI As when old father Nilus gins to swell With timely pride above the Aegyptian vale, His fattie waves doe fertile slime outwell, And overflow each plaine and lowly dale: But when his later spring gins to avale, Huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherin there breed Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male And partly femall, of his fruitfull seed; Such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed.

Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke, Which swarming all about his legs did crall, And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all. [--~.I.i.l9-22.] 1/4--J. Normand [1970], resumed, \"particular I muscle\") [It] may be said that the artist exists as an artist thanks t~ a particular organ that has come into being within him without his Knowledge, of whose existence he is more aware than other men but which he is perpetually afraid of losing because of its capri\u00ad ciousness, and which must seemingly be indefinitely and continuously recreated--an organ that functions only intermittently, that in which the poetic faculty resides[,] and that reveals strange vistas to the mind--vistas which he will increasingly desire to explore to their depths. This being so, the dimensions of the external world, considered as a system of references, become inadequate and, in the form of utilitarian space and time, unacceptable. The writer is first of all obliged to create an inner space and time that will serve him in the office of a relative, flexible infinity and eternity that is renewable at will, an environment in which the total self can flower as if within himself. This is why the poetic organ must be exercised as a muscle is exercised, for it alone is capable of creating those conditions. Hawthorne began cultivating the faculty of concentration in himself from his early childhood. Illness~ in certain privileged cases, is a happy acci\u00ad dent, as with Montaigne and Pascal, for-it teaches the senses how to direct themselves inwards, and it is within himself that the \u00b7poet sees and hears: otherwise how could we explain the blind Milton's visions, or the deaf Beethoven's music? There are rituals that aid the mind in rendering itself sensitive to these inner dimensions. Gide sat down at his piano or selected an appropriate book to read. Steinbeck listened to records. Hawthorne, sometimes with the aid of physical exercise, sometimes by mental concentration, also used the take his distance from external time and space in order to penetrate into the imagi- nary room of the haunted mind His vision was very prone to assume an intimate, restricted, archaic character; whereas in bright daylight, surrounded by boundless space and teeming reality, he was seized with vertigo. For him, light had always to be mingled with shadow, immensity bounded, the \"particular muscle,\" extension) greatest Earth his uncouth mother was, And blustring Aeolus his boasted syre; Who with his breath, which through the world doth pas, 570 Her hollow womb did secretly inspyre, And fild her hidden caves with stormie yre, That she conceiv'd; and trebling the dew time, In which the wombes of wemen doe, expyre, Brought forth this monstrous masse of earthly slyme, Puft up with emptie wynd, and fild with sinfull X So growen great, through arrogant delight Of th' high descent whereof he way yborne, And through presumption of his matchlesse might, All other powres and knighthood he did scorne. Such now he marcheth to this man forlorne, And left to losse; his stalking steps are stayde Upon a snaggy oke, which he had torne Out of his mothers bowelles, and it made His All alchemy takes place in the imagination, and it is also in the imagination that style is born: it is not simply a polishing process after the work is finished, but the struggle of an artist's personal images into their definitive form. The existence of a style presupposes the existence of a whole world behind it, nour\u00ad ishing it and supporting it. The dimensions of style are those of the imagination, which is why any purely technical approach can never do more than imitate its surfaces, thereby merely creating a confusion between the genuine writer and the sham one. Racine's worst line of all, so outrageous in its alliteration, has become his most famous! Yet what would Racine be if he were not first and foremost a cruel, insistent, compassionate consciousness[,] fasci\u00ad nated by all our human passions? What would Hawthorne be if he were not, beyond the words and the sentences, that gradual and implacable invasion of the consciousness, that inward growth of the plant unfurling symmetrically with the world-tree in which the whole moral, psychic, and esthetic cycle is contained? This ex\u00ad plains the twin growth of the pillory, the prison, the rose, the Letter, and the elf. Love, terror, the cruel law, all have a common 571 trunk, while sensuality, repression, pleasure, guilt, punishment, redemption, like branches and roots, all intermingle and exchange their essences. Hawthorne's whole forest is but a single tree. Light and darkness are the most powerful agents of its growth, and we are the spectators, as in the vegetable kingdom of the external world, of veritable esthetic and psychological phototropisms and geotropisms. The spellbound plants sprout up Indeed, Hawthorne does better: \u00b7he makes it into an organ, a thing of flesh whose substance may be tenuous but which can also become extremely dense and weigh down with a great weight in the physical world the shadowy consciousness and the inward eye then combine to form a whole that is humid light[, \"Wives of the Dead,\"] The seeking mind must be a net stretched across the threshold upon which images slight, like the foliage of the pear tree in The House of the Seven Gables catching the fleeting voices as they pass[, Riv. (Ed.), III, 168, 190,] or.the branches of the summerhouse filtering the moonlight and the breeze [, III, 254]--the drops of water from the depths, the sounds, the muffled class, the flicker\u00ad ing reflections must all be soaked in by osmosis at the orifice of the spring, of the artesian well[, III, 210]. The spheres, images of the heart and head, exchange their fluids, their blood, and fuse together like those two drops symbolizing the passionate loves and hates of the faun and his nymph[, The Marble Faun, Riv., VI, 112]. Such a fusion does not exclude individuality. The mixing of the elements in Hawthorne is always followed by a process of settling and sedimentation, and the Hawthorne hero always returns into himself \"pure,\" like good and evil lying unmixed in the peace\u00ad ful conscience, both as solitary as the first being on earth. The work, created in the image of its author, is apart. It belongs to the individual time of its creator, that of an age chosen and created by him, not accepted and submitted to[: The House of the Seven Gables, Riv., III, 127--'writers of society' (J. N.)]. In\u00ad stead of conforming to the changing caprices of fashion, it follows an austere curve, it clothes itself in that narrow sheath that Gide held to be so necessary. The Hawthorne arabesque, though it loses its tension in the later works and becomes a thing of fluttering tatters, nevertheless created in The Scarlet Letter a harmoniously and powerfully coiled Laocoon [cf. Lessing's essay (A. K. V.)]. This \"convulsive\" beauty later insisted upon by Lautreamont has always been characteristic of works charged with human significance. [--Pp. 349-51, w. notes, adapt.] And, J. Normand [1970], continued, \"hammered I explosions\") Moreover, and this is the danger, though true poetry has very little time for regularly hammered syllables, the same cannot be said of oratory. The same is true of music: the metronome is all very well for giving the beat in a ballet, but not for conducting 572 a symphony. And Hawthorne's true music, like that of Beethoven or Brahms, must be looked for in his profound, complex, sinuous move\u00ad ments, with their imperceptible crescendoes and their interminable decrescendoes. In Beethoven, the wave form predominates: in Brahms[,] the spiral. Though there may-not exist any equivalences from one art to another, there are 11correspondences11[-or'\"cor\u00ad respondances,\" (which) have been examined by S(idney) Lanier in an essay '--]that enable us to discern\u00b7Brahmsian echoes in Hawthorne in the same way that\u00b7 it is possible to hear echoes of Verlaine in Debussy. The accents with which Hawthorne endowed English prose, like those that Brahms bestowed on music, are accents characterized by sinuous modulations, by siren songs interrupted with brief D~onysiac dances and sudden dazzling explo\u00ad sions. The poetic breath that runs through the work symphonizes the themes. Hester's resurrection is not without its \"forest murmurs,\" and the tragedy based upon a primitive oneirism vibrates with the music of the passions. That music and those movements, to use [Gaston] Bachelard's term, \"deposit\" forms, images of the consciousness they haunt and that first gave them birth. [--P. 347, w. n. 33, adapt.] CHRISTORPHESQUE 2/2--L. Schubert [1944], \"hammered explosions,11 extension) I On the first page of this novel (The House ~f the Seven Gables] appears a passage which is almost poetry, so strong is the rhythm of its words and its repeated devices: \"The street is Pyncheon Street; the house is the old Pyncheon House; and an elm- \u00b7tree, of wide circumference, rooted before the door, is familiar to every town-born child by the title of Pyncheon Elm.\" [(Riv. Ed.,) VII, 1] The same devices are used in the second chapter when Hawthorne is speaking of Hepzibah: \"born, too, in Pyncheon Street, under the Pyncheon Elm, and in the Pyncheon House \" Again, in the third chapter, we find a repetition of this motif, although it is somewhat broken-up: \"See here!\" cried he; \"what do you think of this Trade seems to be looking up in Pyncheon Street!\" \"Well, well, this is a sight, to be sure!\" exclaimed the other. \"In the old Pyncheon House, and underneath the Pyncheon Elm!\" [VII, 64] The three terms do not appear so close together again in the course of the story, but whenever Hawthorne uses one of them, the reader cannot help seeing and hearing the other two. The tree is mentioned often in the book, and, as we would expect of Hawthorne, in the last paragraph. Another brief poetic passage is found in the chapter in 573 which Hawthorne, the all-seeing and all-knowing author, talks to the body of Jaffrey Pyncheon: Up, therefore, Judge Pyncheon, upl You have lost a day. But to-morrow will be here anon. Will you rise, betimes, and make the most of it! To-morrow! To-morrow! To-morrow! We, that are alive, may rise betimes to-morrow.

If the mind goes directly to its goal, then the sentence is a dart, an arrow: command, insult, attack, violent start of the whole being[: 'Endicott's harangue, Goodman Riv. Ed.,) V, 167: \"No-\u00ad to thee But who art thou that thou meddlest in this matter?--that darest thrust himself between the sufferer and his God?\"().'] More-often, the \u00b7thought progresses by way of circumvo\u00ad lution or in a circle, and the discourse evolves in accordance with a circular or sinuous plan. The slow, spiralling movement of Dimmesdale's voice during the sermon unwinds into a long musical period, not an oratorical 288-89 (enveloping, insinuating VI, 310. '] Hawthorne's sentence a labyrinth-sent~e, an anticipation of Faulkner's. Delays, folds, detours, and dou~ blings back are the rule. There is the way that we find the words circling, for example, around the figures conjured up by Hester's memory in the pil!ory: the old father, the anxious mother, the young girl, the pale scholar--then the stream begins to ,follow the labyrinth of the city streets as seen in her dream, at which an abrupt reversal brings us back into the market place[, V, 78-80.] Hezibah, searching for Clifford, leads us through a maze of sentences that is homologous with the labyrinth of the House itself, and packed, like it, with memories[: The House of the Seven Gables, Riv., 'III, Ch. 16 (Clifford's chamber). The conc~ntric circles formed by the current of life around the house are conjured up by an image, p. 344 ( current eddy . ) while the sentence also curls around upon itself.'] The torment of the heart agitated by inward convulsions expresses itself in a series of serpentine sentences, slow reptiles that writhe in a melancholy and melodious again, litany, disguised confession, obsession, contra\u00ad diction--a prayer crying out for both punishment and secrecy, the drizzling downfall of a crushed and conquered soul[,] already beginning to inflict its secret punishment upon itself[,~., Riv., V, 89]. The serpent[-]sentence delicately modulates the melancholy of the labyrinthine soul, the tendril-sentence probes and spirals down into the sick consciousness. The torture in\u00ad flicted upon his victim by Chillingworth thus takes on the cruelty of a \"turn of the screw\": by means of a series of interrogations he stirs up unease, then pain, and each of his remarks renews the grip of dread around the minister's heart [: V, 'Ch. 10 (\"The Leech and his Patient\"); 160, \"some hideous secrets\"; \"the powers of nature call for the confession of sin\"; 161: \"why not reveal them here?\"; 162: \"Yet secrets .\".\"; \"These men deceive themselves\"; 165-66 (Ch[illingworth] asks for details about his patient's illness, in reality in order to distress him, so that he can deliver the final blow); 167: \"first lay open to him the wound in your soul.\"'] [--P. 345, lilled torment,\" ext., continued) Or else it is the slow descent into the darkness in search of the secret: the sentence follows all the movements of the man of hate as he gropes his way nearer, almost reaches his goal, and at the least alert retires[, V, 159.] The direction of the Haw\u00ad thorne sentence tends to be a downward one: the weight of the words causes it to descend: \"gold\"--\"tomb\"--\"evil\"--\"rotting flesh.\" Emotionally and morally speaking[,] evil and flesh are heavier than gold: the sentence has a weightier and weightier burden to bear as it progresses, and the rhythm slows down as the descent continues [ : V, '158: \"He now dug into the clergyman's heart . \"'] Dimmesdale, in the course of his ascetic practices, makes a descent into his inner self. During the vigil, the pro\u00ad gressive intensification of the light indicates his progress inward: the sentence rises, but the minister's soul is too heavy to climb up after it[: V, '176: \"He kept vigils glimmering lamp most powerful light \"'] Then the maelstrom begins again, the mill wheel, the hell-sent dance of visions--angels, demons, the mother, the mistress--sometimes vague, sometimes intense[--V, '177: \" or more vividly within the looking\u00ad glass\"']: the sentence follows the movement of the return to the surface, which ends with a slow drifting followed by a silent sedimentation. Pearl's [?] raised finger works like a spell; words heavy with penitential symbolism fall to the bottom of the 577 consciousness, cemented together by muffled, cavernous sonori\u00ad ties[: V, '177: \"pointing her forefinger, first at the scarlet letter on her bosom and then at the clergyman's own breast.'\"] The movement may also be emphasized by caesuras comparable to those in verse. I And although Hawthorne does not insist overmuch on these obvious methods, the rhythm of his sentences, once it escapes from the underground labyrinth, does depend more or less upon their conscious or unconscious use. His descriptive sentences[,] in particular{] the bounding, dancing sentences that are used to evoke Pearl's games or the faun's caperings,[] need to be sustained by metrical artifices[: S. L., Riv., 'V, 126: \" and frisked onward I before Hester I onthe gras I sy path, I with many I a harm I less trip I and tumble.\"' 'Ibid., 163: \"She now skipped I irreverently I from one grave I to another \" H(awthorne) did not consider it worthwhile to point the rhythm of this dance on the graves any further!'

Blair [1762;1850], Taste may be defined \"The power of receiving pleasure from the beauties of nature and of art.\" [T]he faculty by which we relish such beauties, seems more nearly allied to a feeling of sense, than to a process of the understanding; and accordingly from an external sense it has borrowed its name; that sense by which we receive and distinguish the pleasures of food, having, in several languages, given rise to the word taste, in the metaphorical meaning under which we now consider it. However, as in all subjects which regard the operations of the mind, the inaccurate use of words is to be carefully avoided, it must not be inferred from what I have said, that reason is entire,ly excluded from the exertions of taste. Though taste, beyond doubt, be ultimately founded on a certain natural and instinctive sensibility to beauty, yet reason assists taste in many of its operations, and serves to enlarge its power. [] Taste, in. the sense in which I have explained it, is a faculty common in some degrees to all men. Even in the deserts of America, where human nature shows itself in its most uncultivated state, the savages have their ornaments of dress, their war and death songs, their harangues and orators. We must therefore conclude the principles of taste to be deeply founded in the human mind. It is no less essential to man to have some discernment of beauty, than it is to possess the attributes of reason and speech.[] I Th[e] inequality of taste among men is owing, without doubt, in part, to the different frame of their natures; to nicer organs, and finer internal powers, with which some are endowed beyond others. But, if it be owing in part to nature, it is owing to education and culture still more. I Taste and genius are two words frequently joined together; and therefore by inaccurate thinkers, confounded. They signify, however, two quite different things. Taste consists in the power of judging; genius in the power of executing. One may have a consider\u00ad able degree of taste in poetry, eloquence, or any of the fine arts, who has little or hardly any genius for composition or execution in\u00b7 any of these arts: but genius cannot be found without including 581 taste also. Refined taste forms a good critic; but genius is farther necessary to form the poet, or the orator. (--Pp. 16- 17, 18, 29.] And, H. Blair [1762;1850], \"wild beast's harbor,\" ext., continued) A species of beauty, distinct from any I have yet mentioned, arises from design or art; or in other words, from the perception of means being adapted to an end; or the parts of any thing being well fitted to answer the design of the whole. When in consider\u00ad ing the structure of a tree or a plant, we observe how all the parts, the roots, the stem, the bark, and the leaves, are suited to the growth and nutriment of the whole; much more wben we survey all the parts and members of a living animal, or when we examine any one of the curious works of art; such as a clock, a ship, or any nice machine; the pleasure which we have had in the survey, is wholly founded on this sense of beauty. It is altogether different from the perception of beauty produced by colour, figure, variety, or any of the causes formerly mentioned. When I look at a watch, for instance, the case of it, if finely engraved, and of curious worksmanship, strikes me as beautiful in the former sense; bright colour, exquisite polish, figures finely raised and turned. But when I examine the spring and the wheels, and praise the beauty of the internal machinery, my pleasure then arises wholly from the view of that admirable art, with which so many various and complicated parts are made to unite for one purpose. This sense of beauty, in fitness and design, has an exten\u00ad sive influence over many of our ideas. It is the foundation of the beauty which we discover in the proportion of doors, windows, arches, pillars, and all orders of architecture. [--Pp. 53- 54.] And, H. Blair (1762;1850], continued, \"red axe I choaked\") Wherever strong exclamations, tones, and gestures, enter much into conversation, the imagination is always more exercised; a greater effort of fancy and passion is excited.-\u00ad Consequently, the fancy kept awake, and\"rendered more sprightly by this mode of utterance, operates upon style, and enlivens it more. These reasonings are confirmed by undoubted facts. The style of all the most early languages, among nations who are in the first and rude periods of society, is found, without exception, to be full of figures; hyperbolical and picturesque in a high degree. We have a striking instance of this in the American lan\u00ad guages, which are known by the most authentic accounts, to pe 582 figurative to excess. The Iroquois and Illinois carry on their treaties and public transactions with bolder metaphors, and greater pomp and style, than we use in our poetical productions.* [*Thus, to give an instance of the singular style of these nations, the Five Nations of Canada, when entering on a treaty of peace with us, expressed themselves by their chiefs, in the following language: \"We are happy in having buried under ()ground the red axe, that has so often been dyed with the blood of our brethren. ()Now, in this .sort., we_ inter the axe, and plant the tree of peace. We plant a tree ()whose top wil(l) reach the sun, and its branches spread abroad, so that it shall be ()seen afar off. May its growth never be stifled and choaked, but may it shade both ()your country and ours with its leaves! Let us make fast its roots and extend them ()to the utmost of your colonies. If the French should come to shake this tree, we ()would know it by the motion of its roots reaching into our country.

A little letter of Una's not long after we arrived in Rockferry alludes to this element in our happiness: -- \"We went to take a walk to-day, and I do not think I ever had such a beautiful walk before in all my life. Julian and I got some very pretty flowers, such as do not grow wild in America. I found some exquisite harebells by the roadside, and some very delicate little pink flowers. And I got some wild holly, which is very pretty indeed; it has very glossy and prickery leaves. I have seen a great many hedges made of it since I have been here'; for nothing can get over it or through it, for it is almost as prickery as the Hawthorne [the bush and the family name were always the same thing to us children], of which almost all the hedges in Liverpool, and everywhere I have been, are made; and there it grows up into high trees, so that nothing in the world can look through it, or climb over it, or crawl through it; and I am afraid our poor hedge in Concord will never look so well because the earth round it is so sandy and dry, and here it is so very moist and rich. It ought to be moist, and any rate, for it rains enough.\" But later she writes on \"the eighteenth day of perfect weather,\" and where can the weather seem so perfect as in England? After breakfast on Christmas we always went to the places, in that parlor where Christmas found us (nomads that we were), where our mother had set out our gifts. \" Julian found[, writes Sophia,] a splendid flag from the Nurse. This flag was a wonder The stripes were made of rich red and white striped satin, which must have been manufactured for the express purpose of composing the American flag.

XXVII ~ Ill: And all about hedges [in Duleek, Ireland] was like a visit to an old friend. My father, for the last few years of his life, had been extremely interested in the use of extract of hawthorn fruit as a mild tonic for.people suffering from congestive heart troubles. Digitalis, the original plant medication for the failing heart, can cause serious side effects. Hawthorn extract, although not as potent, is much safer and was a popular medication around the turn of the century. The so-called miracle drugs, he said, were grossly overrated, and dangerous. The hawthorn['s] . reputation for healing powers stems from Biblical times. The Crown of Thorns was thought to be made of hawthorn, a legend that created its reputation for miraculous healing powers. Also, the staff of Joseph of Arimathea, which amazingly sprouted when tossed on the earth, was made of hawthorn. No wonder hawthorn was tested and used so often by herbalists. And although modern medical science has passed by this pleasant tree and its colorful fruit in its passion for synthetic medicines, objective scientific tests have shown hawthorn to be of benefit to the heart. The source of the medicinal power is in the small, apple-like fruit, which can easily be used by people lucky enough to have access to the trees, and who are interested in trying the [recommended] method. Crataegus is the Greek name for plants of the hawthorn genus, and Crataegus oxycantha is the specific variety most used for making medicine. That also is the most popular Euro\u00ad pean hedge hawthorn. Homeopathic physicians make an extract, which they call a tincture, of the fresh berries only. It is said to keep its potency for several years if stoppered well. In Germany, the full-strength: juice of the berries is sold in health food stores. Sometimes a 587 juice is made of berries and leaves together. [--\"Hawthorn: Tree with a Heart,\" Organic Gardening, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Jan. 1976), 52-53.] And; R. Rodale [1976], \"extract of I small apple,\" continued) Several types of hawthorns produce fruit that is vitamin-rich and edible. Alfred 1929-42)], says that \"The fruit of Crataegus aestivalis and C. mexicana is made into preserves and jellies; also the fruits of the Molles group [of hawthorns] are suited for jelly-making, and in South Carolina an excellent jelly similar in quality and taste to Guava jelly is made from the fruits of some species of the Flavae flava and aprica. Don't let those Latin names throw you. They're essential for dealing effectively with useful shrubs like the hawthorn, which exists in roughly 1,000 different species, each of which has its own characteristics of size, flowering and fruiting habit. Some have been brought here from Europe, and others are native-American plants. I .... [--\"Hawthorn: Tree with a Heart,\" [1860;1897], resumed, \"extract of small apple,\" extension) My father also tasted the piquant flavors of merriment and luxury in this exquisite domicile of Heart's-Ease and Mrs. Meadows [=Mr. and Mrs. Fields]. And at The wayside, too, we had delightful pleasures, in the teeth and front of simplicity and seclusion, sandy flower-borders, rioting weeds, and intense heats. Concord itself could gleam occasionally, even outside of its perfect Junes and Octobers, as we can see here in the merry geniality of Louisa Alcott, who no more failed to make people laugh than she failed to live one of the bravest and best of lives. In return for a package of birthday gifts she sent us a poem, from which I take these verses: -- \"The.Hawthorne is a gracious tree From latest twig to parent root, For when all others leafless stand It gayly blossoms and bears fruit. On certain days a friendly wind Wafts from its spreading boughs a store of canny gifts that flutter in Like snowflakes at a neighbor's door. 588 \"',!:he spinster who has just been blessed Finds solemn thirty much improved, By proofs that such a crabbed soul Is still remembered and beloved.

Time will give it an evergreen name. Axe cannot harm it, frost cannot kill; \u00b7With Emerson's pine and Thoreau's oak ' Will the Hawthorne be loved and honored still!\" My mother's records, moreover, in letters to her husband, refer to the humble labors that almost filled up her devoted year ,and these references indicate the difference we felt between Europe and home:-- Rose raised [writes Sophia] all the echoes of the county by screaming with joy over her blooming crocuses, which she found in her garden. The spring intoxicates her with \"remembering wine.\" She hugs and kisses me almost to a mummy, with her raptures. Little spots of green grass choke her with unutterable ecstasy. September 1, 1860.

Jerome had devoted his Liber de nominibus hebraicis to these. Another authority for medieval interpretation of names was Augustive.[] He plays with the names Vincentius, Felicitas, Perpetua, Primus. Why is the Apostle of the Gentiles names Paulus? Because he is minimus apostolorum. The same sort of thing is frequent later in the acts of the martyrs.[] All that I have presented so far can be taken as more or less. insipid trifling. But it acquires fundamental significance for the Middle Ages by the performance of the great Isidore of Seville, who 589 in his compilation of all human knowledge chose the road from designation to essence, from verba to res, and accordingly named his work Etymologiarum libri( (a)lso entitled Origines ] [Ilt may be called the basic book of the entire Middle Ages. It not only established the canonical stock of knowledge for eight centuries but also molded their thought categories. It led to the origo (\"origin\") and vis (\"force\") of things. In Book I, 29, etymology is dealt with as a part of grammar. [N]ot all words can be etymologized.\u00b7 The because he is made of humus); \"ex contrariis\"--and here we find the still the explanation \"quia umbra opacus parum luceat.\" In a later passage (VII, 6) Isidore gives the interpretation of most important Old Testament names[] after Jerome. [This theme was also handled \"poetically\" (Poetae, IV, 630).] Quantities of other etymologies are scattered through the 800-odd pages of the book. Since composition of poetry was a part of rhetoric, and since etymology was among the fundamentals of grammar and rhetoric, it was and remained an obligatory \"ornament\" of poetry. This is the practice in the West as early as the Merovingian period. I give some examples from the Carolingian period. In the early Middle Ages such etymologies were often treated in accordance with the prescription \"Rhyme me or I eat thee.\" [--\"XIV. Etymology etymological evaluation of proper names passed from the eulogies of pagan late Antiquity to Christian poetry, including hymns In the twelfth century the procedure was taken into the arts of poetry as \"argumentum sive locus a nomine\" and illustrated from Ovid Marbod the epistemological import of etymology . He finds mors an \"asper sonus\" because death itself is harsh. Vita, on the other hand, is pleasant- sounding. We find etymological jesting in Goliardic satire too Thus from the dignified Isidore and the poets of edifying passions and lives of saints we have drifted on to carefree verse. But etymology has yet another surprise in store for us: Dante takes up the game and transforms it in the mysterious mysticism of the Vita nuova, purifies it in the high art of the Commedia. The young Dante's \"glorious lady\" is called Beatrice by many \"li quali sapeano che si chiamare.\" According to Zingarelli, this means: They did not know what name they should give her, and called her Beatrice because they had an inkling of the truth. In \u00a7 13 of the treatise Dante conse-590 quentia rerum.\" Italian Dante scholarship claims found this principle almost verbatim in Justinian's Institutiones. [Dante] used [this principle] frequently elsewhere: above all in the lives of St. Francis and St. Dominic in the Paradiso. Of St. him who would interpret the etymology of A~sisi not regard A&sisi as derived from ascendere (i.e., as \"ascent\")--that were too little: It was the rising of a sun. In [a] canto Dominic and his parents make up a sacred trio of names This detail shows yet again that Dante's poetic style came into the inheritance of the Latin Middle Ages and puri\u00ad fied it by genius. The thing was and Baroque. [For] as usual, Calderon. later taken over by Humanism[], the Renaissance, Speaking names The last catch-basin, is, In 'figurative' language, incl. (gustatory) 'gestures'] is the style of the Old Testament, which is carried on by constant allusions to sensible objects. Iniquity, or guilt, is expressed by \"a spotted garment;\" misery, by \"drinking the cup of astonishment;\" vain pursuits, by \"feeding on ashes;\" a sinful life, by \"a crooked path;\" prosperity, by \"the candle of the Lord shining on our head;\" and the like, in innumer\u00ad able instances. Hence we have been accustomed to call this sort of style the oriental style; as fancying it to be peculiar to the nations of the east; whereas, from the American style, and from many other instances, it plainly appears not to have been peculiar to any one region or climate; but to have been common to all nations in certain period~of society and language. Hence we may receive some light concerning that seeming paradox, that poetry is more ancient than prose.

Oh no! my little Rosebud would never do such naughty things as those. When you come back to England, Mamma (I hope) will say: 'Yes; our little Rosebud has been the best and sweetest little girl I ever knew in my life. She has never screamed nor uttered any but the softest and sweetest sounds. She has never struck Nurse nor Unor nor dear Mamma with her little fist, nor scratched them with her sharp little nails; and if ever there was a little angel on earth, it is our dear little Rosebud!['] And when Papa hears this, he will be very glad, and will take Rosebud up in his arms and kiss her over and over again. But if he were to hear that she had been naughty, Papa would feel it his duty to eat little Rosebud up! Would not that be very terrible? Julian is quite well, and sends you his love. I have put a kiss for you in this letter; and if you do not find it, you may be sure that some naughty person has got it. Tell Nurse I want to see her very much. Kiss Una for me. Your loving PAPA. [--Pp. 294-95 (Rose the crime [of Miriam and Donatello, 'reenacting the Fall from Eden,'] and feels as guilty as her two friends, finds peace through, of all institutions, the Roman Catholic church and its sacrament of penance. Although she does not confess to the Catholic clergyman all that she knows--she is too much a loyal child of the Puritans to succumb that completely to papal authority--Hawthorne makes it clear that the symbol of the Church's forgiveness, the confessional, goes far toward assuaging her conscience. In a morally troubling world, then, Hawthorne leads his readers back to the bosom of the mother church in Rome and through his sympathetic treatment of Hilda's predicament implicitly counsels, if only briefly, the necessary ecumenicalism that [Horace] Bushnell sanctioned and that would mark Protestantism's development in the latter part of the 592 century. If men inhabit a world of private symbols, Hawthorne implies, a world in which guilt no longer can be resolved through the conventional forms of Protestant atonement, one of the more viable solutions to the painful introspection brought on by such newly imposed moral responsibility might be spiritual membership in the most complex symbol system of all, the Catholic church. It may be coincidental [cf. correspondential, flesh/soul-consonant (A. K. V.)] that Hawthorne's daughter Rose herself became a con\u00ad vert to. the Roman Catholic faith [a sister of mercy], but one cannot help but think that she was led to that commitment by her father's recognition that the moral agony that accompanied the [rhetoro-orphic!] centrifugal social developments of the 1850s demanded a peace only available in the world's most elaborate symbolic construction. [See again my I.End Notes.l6(b,v)--for a Roman Catholic moment of Christ-intimacy.] For all Hawthorne's genuinely sympathetic interest in his countrymen's unsettling struggle with the moral complexities engendered by religious skepticism, however, the conclusions of his novels offer resolutions that, while personally acceptable to him, could not always have been so appealing to his readers, particularly those who doubted'the ethical accommodations made by characters like Hilda ['soothed by the blessing of the pope's emissary'] and Hester ['living out her life in resigned expiation while still paying implicit allegiance to the Puritan community that chastised her']. [circle-diagrammed] quartet of empirical charac\u00ad ter types is passive or benign. As we have seen in the mythological tales, the tyrannical father is frequently linked with an ineffec\u00ad tual but pleasant old man, a benign father (1) who relinquishes his authority and supports the younger generation. Tired old Aegus, Theseus' father, is such a man; he is full of love for his son but totally incompetent to better the young man's fortunes or to triumph over Minos. [ Cf. James Joyce's \"anagramatic () transform(ing of) Minos into the false father, 'Simon' Daedelus, in A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man\"--1916.] The young man must champion his father and his country. It is clear, however, that Hawthorne felt sympathy for thes~ losers in life's power struggle. 'The Old Apple Dealer,' a basic study of this type, is a sympathetic figure; and Uncle Venner, the 'patchwork philosopher' of Seven Gables, knows that the avuncular role is to advise the young rather than command. The great virtue of such sunny characters is their power of sympathy and affection. (Or--of yell-haw!-low extract-seminal transmission (A. K. V.).] 593 The counterpart of the benign father is a female figure whom we may call the benign mother (2). So rare is this type in Haw\u00ad thorne's fiction that one is tempted to account for her obscurity in biographical terms: was she the kind of woman whom Hawthorne was likely to have known in his own family? In the mythological tales she appears as Aethra, Theseus' 'widowed' mother to whom he finally returns; as Queen Telephassa [=El-passing! code (A. K. V.)}, the quest; and as Philemon's \u00b7spouse; [but-ter-making!] Baucis. In the New England context, dominated by the callous goodwives of Boston, and the younger Resters and Priscillas, she appears as Mrs. Lindsey of 'The Snow Image,' a [milk-bosomed!] woman who 'all through her life had kept her heart full of child-like simplicity and faith' ([Riv.

C. Conclusion: The Scale-Hawthornesque in the Context of Linguistic Science as Poetic Study. In the foregoing, developmental part of this, the fourth and final chapter of the thesis, the oral-consonantal scale of signature\u00ad gestures specifically developed for the study of the literary works of Nathaniel Hawthorne has served as a perceptual stratagem for examining the continuity of oral-aspects in critical and literary texts. Would it be improper, at this point, to accommodate an observation made by P. Gura, in The Wisdom of Words: Language, Theology, and Literature in the New England Renaissance ([1981], p. 5), to say that perhaps the idea of mouth is \"an [extricable-]inextricable part of the cultural matrix from which our classic American writers emerged,\" and from which authors continue to emerge, as living, appealing, if often enigmatic booked voices for us today? The primitive organismic message of 599 Hawthorne's discourse on name, in other words, may have organizing value in the study of authors other than Hawthorne; and the applica- bility to other authors would suggest a convention of oracles, of 14 hunger-artists (cf. Franz Kafka, ca. 1924 ), as open as the format- jaws of a book to the universal revaluation of the cultural yet anthropomorphic quiring of their forms. But the present study acknowledges the unextricated idiosyncrasies of its own close- readings, and admits it would h~sitate at the threshold of any future study of textual orality, consonance, and word-proliferation, which (text-factually) may constitute the structure of an insidious attack--with private over-kill--of all systems of language--the Ambush of Mind through Language, as in Na~haniel Hawthorne. It would hesitate, however (\" and [the onlookers] did not want ever to move away.\"--Kafka), with the hope of selecting scale- correlative restricted instruments for the study of shorter expanses of literary text--and, still, from a field of study remarkable for its internal, intellectual disharmony, with regard to the importance of articulatory perception in the emergence of significant phonetic ~ 7 ) 15 form (I. Fonagy et al., 1971; R. Jakobson and L.

[W. Allen, 1953]; J. Grimm, 1967; D. B. Fry et al., 1976).16 The bonding of 600 significant form to articulatory change-movement, especially to consonant-cluster frames as experimental, manipulable counters in the assessment of \"psychomorphs,\" or speech-community universals not necessarily identical with historically corrected etymologies, has remained a viable concern (Socrates-Plato, ca. 400 B.C.; J. Wallace, 1653; H. Blair, 1762-1800, 1850; D. Bolinger, 1950, 1965; R. Jakobson 17 and L. Waugh, 1979). The bonding of correlative perceptions of consonant- and vowel~systems and color-and size-associations with the perception of auditory and articulatory events has remained a viable concern (J. Locke, 1694 [on blindman's \"scarlet\"]; J. [on C. Burchfield, 1912-1919]; R. Jakobsen and L. Waugh, 1979). The bonding of word as \"creative stress\" with anatomical-alphabetic mnemonic systems, serpentine-botanical-solar eidolons, and neurological and endocrine-feed process in phonetico-mystical states has remained a Greimas, 1974; W. Howard, 1979).19 The bonding of significant form and social-individual emergence to the maturity and health of oral anatomy--especially to the maturation of the velar-stop mechanism--has remained a viable concern (Quintilianus, 35?-100? A.D.; 1971; G. Miller, 1981).20 And the bonding of significant form to the (reconstructed) physical facts of human postural evolution--which allowed for inter- dependent changes in hand-feeding, frontalization of sexual behavior-, and development of brain, speech-apparatus, and of the speech-interactive community--has remained a viable concern (J. Rousseau, 1755; H. Clarke, 1852-1887, and A. R. 21 al., 1964; P. Lieberman, 1975; J. Sheets, 1977), possibly relevant to continuing rituals of (diverse-level) verbo-poetic aggression and recession in writers and readers, culinary designs and theatrical consummations celebrating Provident oro-genital truncations, and lasting if \"oruboros\" (=tail-eater)]; ~ ' C. Levi-Strauss, 1964, 1969; K. interpr. M. Quilligan, 1979; W. Ong, 1971 and 1981; 22 A. Hustad, 1981). These viable, articulation-linked concerns of studies in phonetic symbolism constitute the province of exchange, for the choosing of scale-correlative, retemperable devices, in the study-602 extending, future reading of literary texts that would hunger after near/self-determined, intimately ever-present, immortal design. To help close the present reading of texts, the study cites the oral prose-excitement of Roman Jakobson (with Linda Waugh)--or the printed self-assertion which closes the four-th and final essay, \"The Spell of Speech Sounds,\" in The Sound Shape of Language (1979). The study cites that closing statement as a self-evident demonstration of the (mix of) oral-motor values which must perhaps inform the idea of \"immediate (phonetic] signification\"--even in the text of a language scientist devoted to the defense of the auditory ground in the struc- tural investigation of phonetic systems. The oral immediacy of Jakobson (1979), forecasting the ultimate, sperm-transcendental union of poetic and linguistic disciplines in phonetic signs (the signs of Miltonic Virginal Stable), reads as follows: The passion of the linguist and poet Edward Sapir for the work of the poet and linguisLGerard Manley Hopkins, and partic\u00ad ularly for his \"almost terrible immediacy of utterance,\" a power spontaneously bound with a \"wild joy in the sheer sound of words\" ((Selected Writings, ed. D. Mandelbaum (Berkeley, Calif., 1949), p.] 500), reflects both Hopkins' and Sapir's magic insight into the \"inscape\" of poetic creation. One recalls the nickname \"medicine man\" assigned to Sapir by Leonard Bloomfield (see [C. F. Hockett[, ed., A Leonard Bloomfield Anthology (Blooming\u00ad ton, Ind., 1970), p.] 540). That spell of the \"sheer sound of words\" which bursts out in the expressive, sorcerous, and mythopoeic tasks of language, and to the utmost extent in poetry, supplements and counter\u00ad balances the specific linguistic device of 'double articulation' ['sound matter . into words,' then 'words to generate sentences'] and supersedes this disunity by endowing the distinctive features themselves with the power of immediate signification. Their mediate way of signification totally disappears in the poetic experiments of the early twentieth century, which are parallel 603 to the abstract trend in painting and akin to the magic ingredient in oral tradition (cf. R[.] J[akobson, Selected Writings, V grosse Christian Morgenstern his introduced by Zarathustra's saying--\"a true man conceals in him\u00ad self a child who wants to play\"-One is struck by lines such as Seiokronto -prafriplo and Hontrarurumiromente, with their glossolalic ~, as well as the subsequent line Entepente, leio\u00ad lente, which is quite close to counting-out rhymes: the ~ pente of Abzahlsreime. And in fact it was precisely the counters of children's games (such as eni beni, ani bani) which inspired the versicle \"Vanja-banja\" of the famous Nebesnye verbljuiata 'The Heavenly the Elena Guro (1877-1913[; publ. St. Petersburg, 1914]). The ubiquity and mutual implication of Verb and Verbal Art impart a seminal unity to the forthcoming science of the two inseparable universals, Language and Poetry. 23 (Jakobson and Waugh, p. 231--cit. sources as noted) And to the above, the wood-prose mask of Nathaniel Hawthorne (see motto, Chapter I), the lion's head of the ~-intoning Grandfather's Chair, in its private self-address to \"the larger questions of language and meaning\" (P. Gura, p. 153), may be fancied synchronically to remark: and the lion's head at the summit, seamed almost to split its hawse and shake its name-- Thou gavest me their necks, on them Thou mad'est me passe. Behold they cry, but who to them his help applys? Thus freed from mutin men, thou Yea me by folks I never knew; My name their eares, their eares their hearts to me enchaine; ......................................................... Among the Gentiles then I, Lord, yeild thanks to Thee, I to Thy Name will sing, and this my song shall bee: 604 He nobly saves his King, and kindness keeps in store, For David his Anoynt, and his seed ever more. (The Psalms of David, Ps. XVIII, metaphrase by Sidney [1585])24 In the psychomorphic linguistic cradle of mouth, the present study, in other wor!3,s, folds its leaves, to investigate oral-gestural instruments, which may contribute to the forthcoming harmonies of linguistic science and verbal art. \"He was beginning to grow cold about the groin, when he uncovered\u00b7his face, I I ... and Crito closed his eyes and mouth.\" 25 (The death of Socrates, Phaedo.)
