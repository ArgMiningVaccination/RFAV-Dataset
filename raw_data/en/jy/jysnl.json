It also contains recommendations and resources to help providers prompt ly diagnose and initiate hospital care for children with KD. NursingKawasaki Disease Key Points: Since January 1, 2019, 16 San Diego County residents have been diagnosed with KD at Rady Children's HospitalSan Diego (RCHSD), number based on prior winters. KD is a seasonal disease that occurs in clusters, with March a s the typical peak month for symptom onset in Southern California. A second, small er peak occurs in midsummer. KD should be considered in any pediatric patient presenting wi th sustained fever and any combination of rash, nonexudative conjunctival injecti on, red lips and pharynx, cervical adenitis, and extremity edema or erythema of the palms or soles. NursingKawasaki Disease Key Points Continued: Although 85% of patients with KD are younger than 5 years, KD can present at older ages. Children of Asian/Pacific Island descent have the h ighest incidence. KD can initially be misdiagnosed as scarlet fever, measles, mu mps, bacterial lymphadenitis, and adenovirus. Consider the possibility of meas les especially if recent international travel or contact with an international tr aveler. Laboratory studies detailed in this advisory are helpful in confirming the KD diagnosis and excluding alternative diagnoses. NursingKawasaki Disease Key Points Continued: Treatment of KD with highdose IVIG and moderate dose aspirin should be initiated as soon as the clinical diagnosis can be confidently made. An echocardiogram by a pediatric sonographer should be performed w ithin 24 hours of initiation of treatment. RCHSD has a dedicated KD specialist on call 24/7 to assist hea lthcare providers in diagnosing and managing KD (page via the RCHSD operator at 858 5761700, ext. 0). NursingKawasaki Disease Immunization Program Situation Since January 1, 2019, 16 San Diego County residents have been diagnosed with KD at RCHSD, at least twice the number that would be expected b ased on prior years. RCHSD cares for 80100 new KD patients each year from Sa n Diego and surrounding counties with a dedicated inpatient service and wee kly clinic. A recent study published by the RCHSD team demonstrates that KD is a sea sonal disease that occurs in clusters, with March the peak of the annual epid emic in Southern California. There is a second, smaller peak in midsummer. Sporadic cases occur all year long. The seasonality of KD is correlated with specific climatic cond itions which are predicted to persist in San Diego County from midFebruary into March. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for KD in any child prese nting with fever and any combination of rash, bilateral conjunctival injection with sparing of the limbus and without exudate, red lips and DiseaseNursing Background KD is an acute vasculitis of childhood that can lead to corona ry artery aneurysms in up to 25% of untreated cases. It is a selflimited febrile illn ess of unknown cause that predominantly affects children less than five years of age . KD is thought to result from genetic susceptibility and environmental trigger(s) . KD has not been a reportable disease in California, since June 2011, so the current incidence is unknown. Most local KD cases are cared for at RCHS D, so local epidemiology may be inferred from their cases. The RCHSD KD tea m recently published their experience with 788 KD patients from 2006 to 20 15; over this period, the average incidence of KD in children less than five years old in San Diego County was 25 per 100,000 children, with the greatest incidence (50 per 100,000) for Asian/Pacific Islanders. Compared with other race/ethniciti es, Asian/Pacific Islander patients with KD were younger, were diagnosed earlier in the course of their fever, had higher levels of inflammatory markers, and wer e more likely to develop aneurysms. Kawasaki DiseaseNursing Background Continued The American Heart Association (AHA) has established criteria for the diagnosis of complete and incomplete KD. The diagnosis of KD may be made in the presence of fever and four of the five classic criteria (exanthem, conjunct ival injection, oropharyngeal changes, peripheral extremity changes, and cervic al lymphadenopathy) or in the presence of fewer criteria with a co ronary artery Z score (internal diameter of the left anterior descending or rig ht coronary arteries expressed as standard deviation units from the mean normalized for body surface area) greater than or equal to 2.5. KD can mimic other rash/fever syndromes of children, and cases may be missed or misdiagnosed. Not all patients m anifest the classic four of fiv e criteria (aka \"incomplete\" KD), and clinical presentation may be more subtle in infants younger than 6 months of age. Fever is essentially invariant, and no on e particular pattern is characteristic. The fever is often greater than >39\u00b0C (102.2 \u00b0F) and accompanied by extreme irritability. Kawasaki DiseaseNursing Consideration of Each of the Classic Clinical Signs Exanthem: The exanthem of KD can take many different forms and is often polymorphous in the same patient. In its maculopapular presenta tion on the trunk and extremities, it can be easily confused with a drug reaction because many of these patients have been treated with antibiotics for erroneous diagnoses. Another common form of the rash is raised papules coalescing in to plaques. This may be associated with targetlike lesions with central clearin g and can be confused with erythema multiforme. A pure erythroderma with no palpable component as in staphylococcal toxin-mediated disease is not as sociated with KD. Similarly, a confluent, fine maculopapular (\"sandpaper\") rash e xtending onto the face as in scarlet fever is unlikely and should prompt consider ation of scarlet fever. A fine micropustulareruption on the buttocks, thighs, and exten sor surfaces can sometimes be seen and is perhaps pathognomonic of KD. Accentuat ion of the rash with confluent erythema in the groin that peels during the acut e, febrile phase is seen in up to 50% of patients. Kawasaki DiseaseNursing Consideration of Each of the Classic Clinical Signs Continued Conjunctival Injection : Prominent dilated vessels within the bulbar conjunctivae without edema or infiltration of inflammatory cells on conjunct ival biopsy is the hallmark of KD. The lack of edema in the conjunctiva allows the limbus to be easily seen, giving the appearance of a white halo around the iris. Th e lack of edema and exudate are important features in distinguishing KD from other acute infections associated with fever and conjunctivitis, most notably adenovir us, enterovirus, and measles infection. Presence of exudative conjunctivitis should prompt search for a different diagnosis. Kawasaki DiseaseNursing Consideration of Each of the Classic Clinical Signs Continued Oropharyngeal Changes : Erythema of the lips with fissuring and erythema of the posterior pharynx are the most common mucocutaneous findings in acute KD. Sloughing of the filiform papillae of the tongue leaving a glos sy red surface punctuated by the fungiform papillae creates the classic \"straw berry tongue\" appearance associated with both KD and streptococcal and staphy lococcal toxin mediated diseases. The presence of a true strawberry tongue ess entially eliminates common viral infections from the differential diagno sis of a patient because these agents are not associated with this pattern of in jury. The presence of exudative pharyngitis or discrete intraoral lesions should p rompt search for an alternative diagnosis. Kawasaki DiseaseNursing Consideration of Each of the Classic Clinical Signs Continued Peripheral Extremity Changes: Edema of the dorsa of the hands and feet with or without erythema of the palms and soles often develops after se veral days of fever. The fusiform swelling of the digits accompanied by swell ing and purple discoloration of the proximal interphalangeal joints is a class ic finding. The painful arthritis may limit the child's use of their hands, and the swe lling of the feet often discourages ambulation. The vasodilation of the palms and soles is distinct from the exanthem on the rest of body and is a diffuse, blanching er ythema that may be fluctuating. Kawasaki DiseaseNursing Consideration of Each of the Classic Clinical Signs Continued Cervical Lymphadenopathy: This clinical sign is the least reliable feature and is seen in only 30% to 50% of patients. It is most commonly unilat eral and inflammation in the sternocleidomastoid muscle often limits rot ation of the head. The cervical mass should be at least 1.5 cm in diameter to qual ify for this criterion. Studies have shown that correct diagnosis of KD is often delaye d in patients who initially present with the cervical mass and fever (nodefirst presentation of KD) and are diagnosed with bacterial lymphadenitis. The appearance of the rash can further delay diagnosis when it is misinterpreted as a drug eru ption, prompting a change in antibiotics. In distinguishing nodefirst KD from bac terial lymphadenitis, helpful sedimentation rat e (ESR), Creactive protein (CRP) level, absolute band count, and imaging studies b y ultrasound or computed tomography that demonstrate clusters of nodes (rather than one dominant node) and retropharyngeal edema. Kawasaki DiseaseNursing There is no single laboratory test that confirms the diagnosis of KD. The laboratory evaluation of patients with suspected KD should include markers of inflammation and tests to exclude other competing diagnoses. The acute phase is associated with an elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predomi nance and elevated acutephase reactants including CRP and ESR. The plate let count usually rises during the second week after illness onset, whereas the a cutephase reactants normalize over two t o four weeks after treatment. Kawasaki DiseaseNursing Recommendations for Providers Consider KD in pediatric patients with sustained fever and any combination of rash, nonexudative conjunctival injection, red lips and pharyn x, cervical adenitis, and extremity edema. A flow diagram for the evaluation of incomplete KD is provided at the end of this advisory. Order appropriate laboratory studies in suspected cases or ref er to RCHSD urgent care or emergency department for evaluation. Studies should include: complete blood count (CBC) with manual transfe rase (GGT). Blood, throat, and urine cultures and viral polymerase chain r eaction (PCR) panels should be ordered as appropriate to exclude other potential dia gnoses. A positive PCR result for any virus does not rule out the diagnosis of KD as children may shed virus for weeks after an acute infection. Kawasaki DiseaseNursing Recommendations for Providers Continued Typical findings are a neutrophil predominance with immature ( band) forms, normocytic and normochromic anemia, normal to elevated platelet count, high ESR, and CRP. ALT and GGT usually track together and can both be normal, or both elevated. Urine may show an elevated white cell count with negative nitr ites and leukocyte esterase consistent with sterile pyuria.

Kawasaki DiseaseNursing InfluenzaNursing The following will include numbers from the CDC, state and loc al public health and our internal numbers of flu a nd influenzalike illness (ILI) -d efined as any illness with fever (100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) AND cough and/or sore throat (in the absence of a known cause other than influenza). Internally at Scripps, our n umbers are tracking slightly less than last year for cases of ILI and influenza. T hese cases are tracked throughout our clinics and hospitals, including our ED's and UC 's. It appears at this point in time, Scripps is having a less severe influenza season than last year and possibly less than the last three years. The primary strain id entified thus far is Influenza A, H1N1. H1N1 is the most common strain identified o n testing for most of the country including the western US, but H3N2 is the predom inate strain in the southeastern US. As far as the vaccine match, the majority of the influenza viruses being characterized on testing are similar to the cellgrown re ference viruses represented in the 20182019 Northern Hemisphere influenza vacc ine. Below is a section on the different influenza strains and a specific discu ssion on why young, healthy adults may be impacted more this year than the elderly. InfluenzaNursing Background Information on the Different Influenza Strains There are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C and D. Huma n influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease almost every winter in the United States. The emergence of a new and very different influenza A virus to infect people can cause an influenza pandemic. Influenza type C infections genera lly cause a mild respiratory illness and are not th ought to cause epidemics. Inf luenza D viruses primarily affect cattle and are not known to infect or cause il lness in people. Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two pro teins on the surface of the virus: the hemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N). The re are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes and 11 different N1 through N11 respectively.)InfluenzaNursing Background Information on the Different Influenza Strains Conti nued Influenza A viruses can be further broken down into different strains. Current subtypes of influenza A viruses found in people are influenza A (H1N1) and influenza A (H3N2) viruses. In the spring of 2009, a new influe nza A (H1N1) virus emerged to cause illness in people. This virus was very differe nt from the human influenza A (H1N1) viruses circulating at that time. The new vi rus caused the first influenza pandemic in more than 40 years. That virus (often cal led \"2009 H1N1\") has now replaced the H1N1 virus that was previously circulating in humans. Influenza B viruses are not divided into subtypes, but can be further broken down into lineages and strains. Currently circulating influenza B vi ruses belong to one of two lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria.InfluenzaNursing Background Information on the Different Influenza Strains Conti nued CDC follows an internationally accepted naming convention for influenza viruses. This convention was accepted by WHO in 1979 and published in Fe bruary 1980 in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 58(4):585591 (1 980). The approach uses the following components: - The antigenic type (e.g., A, B, C) - The host of origin (e.g., swine, equine, chicken, etc. For hum anorigin viruses, no host of origin designation is given.) - Geographical origin (e.g., Denver, Taiwan, etc.)- Strain number (e.g., 15, 7, etc.)- Year of isolation (e.g., 57, 2009, etc.)- For influenza A viruses, the hem agglutinin and neuraminidase a ntigen description - For example: (H1N1) for a virus from duck origin A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) for a virus from human originInfluenzaNursing Influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and one or two influenza B virus es (depending on the vaccine) are now being included in each year's influenza vaccin e. Getting a flu vaccine can protect against flu viruses that are the same or re lated to the viruses in the vaccine. Information about this season's vaccine can be fou nd at Preventing Seasonal Flu with Vaccination ( https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/index.htm ). The seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against influenza C viruses. Additionally, flu vaccines will NOT protect against infection and illness caused by other viruses that also can cause influenzalike symptoms. There are many other no nflu viruses that can result in influenzalike illness (ILI) that spread during f lu season.InfluenzaNursing H1N1 (Swine Flu) -Why the elderly are immune and the young, hea lthy adults are more susceptible? During the H1N1 pandemic of 2009, CDC provided estimates of th e numbers of 2009 H1N1 cases, hospitalizations and deaths on seven different occasions. Final estimates were published in 2011. These final estimates were th at from April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010 approximately 60.8 million cases (range: 43.389.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (195,086402,719), and 12,469 deaths ( 886818,306) occurred in the United States due to H1N1. Deaths from seasona l human influenza primarily affect young children and the elderly. In a typical season, a graph of influenza deaths by age group has a U shape, with peaks for the very young and the very old and a valley for adol escents to middle aged adults. The 1918 \"Spanish flu\" pandemic was different. It had a third peak for relatively young adults between the ages of 25 and 34.InfluenzaNursing A graph of 1918 influenza deaths by age group has a W shape, w ith peaks for very young children, young adults, and the elderly (Taubenberger & M orens2006). When A/H1N1 \"swine flu\" broke ou t in North America and then the world in 2009, initial reports suggested it may have been following the patter n of the 1918 flu. In its first update on 2009 A/H1N1 swine flu, dated April 24, the World Health Organization reported: \"The majority of these cases have occurred in otherwise healthy young adults. Influenza normally affects the very young and the very old, but these age groups have not been heavily affected in Mexico.\"InfluenzaNursing The A/H1N1 swine flu turned out to be far less deadly than was initially feared. Yet a peculiar pattern emerged: the elderly were not affected like seasonally influenza virus infections. Why do older people seem to be immune to swi ne flu? A possible answer is that the elderly were likely already expo sed to at least one of the hemagglutinins, H1. Between the 1918 and 1957 influenza pa ndemics, H1 circulated in humans, evolving continuously. H1 then became ina ctive, replaced by other subtypes of hemagglutinin such as H3. H1 in humans reappeared in 1977 and has been a dominant subtyp e of human flu ever since. It has evolved significantly from 1977 to the prese nt. One could call this version \"New H1.\" In pigs, meanwhile, the H1 has evolved very little. Swine flu H1 has been very similar to the \"original\" 1918 and 1930 versions of H1. One cou ld call this version \"Old H1.\" To the immune system, Old H1 is very different from N ew H1.InfluenzaNursing It may be speculated that most people born before 1957 were ex posed to human H1 influenza, which at that time was similar to Old H1. Their i mmune systems produced antibodies to Old H1. Since Old H1 has not been seen i n humans in many years, younger people do not have antibodies to Old H1. Meanwhile, the H1N1 strain is now part of the seasonal influen za vaccine. But as you know, the vaccine effectiven ess is not 100%. Thus, it may be that the younger \"unexposed\" people who get the H1N1 influenza this year may hav e more problems than usual. National UpdateInfluenzaNursing 20182019 Influenza Season Week 2 ending January 12, 2019 Influ enza activity remains elevated in the United States. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses continue to cocirculate. Below is a su mmary of the key influenza indicators for the week ending January 12, 2019: Viral Surveillance: The percentage of respiratory specimens te sting positive for influenza viruses in clinical laboratories decreased slightly. Influenza A viruses have predominated in the United States since the beginning of Octobe r. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have predominated in most areas of the cou ntry, however influenza A(H3) viruses have predominated in the southeastern U nited States (HHS Region 4). Virus Characterization: The majority of influenza viruses char acterized antigenically and genetically are similar to the cellgrown reference viruses representing the 2018-2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine viruses. Excerpts taken from CDC's FluView. National UpdateInfluenzaNursing Antiviral Resistance: None of the viruses tested were associat ed with highly reduced inhibition by any of the inhibitors (osel tamivir, peramivir). Influenzalike Illness Surveillance: The proportion of outpati ent visits for influenza like illness (ILI) decreased from 3.5% to 3.1%, but remains abo ve the national baseline of 2.2%. All 10 regions reported ILI at or above their regionspecific baseline level. ILI State Activity Indictor Map: Nine states experienced high ILI activity; New York City and 13 states experienced moderate ILI activity; 10 states experienced low ILI activity; and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 18 stat es experienced minimal ILI activity. Geographic Spread of Influenza: The geographic spread of influ enza in Guam and 30 states was reported as widespread; Puerto Rico and 16 states reported regional activity; three states reported local activity; and the Distric t of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and one state reported sporadic activity. Excerpts taken from CDC's FluView.

These case s are tracked throughout of cl inics and hospitals, including our ED's and UC's. It appears at this point in time, Scripps is having a less severe influenza season than last year and possibly less than t he last three years. At least so far as the number of cases being diagnosed and trea ted. We are not able to track severity yet for our internal cases. MeaslesNursing Features: Measles is an acute viral respiratory illness. It is character ized by a prodrome of fever (as high as 105\u00b0F) and malaise, cough, coryza, and conjun ctivitis the , a pathognomonic enanthema(Koplikspots) followed by a maculopapular rash. The rash usually appears about 14 days after a person is expo sed. The rash spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities. Pa tients are considered to be contagious from 4 days before to 4 days after the rash appears. Of note, sometimes immunocompromised patients do not develop the r ash. CDC's Dr. Jane Seward describes measles clinical features and what to do if a healthcare provider suspects measles, in this 5minute video .MeaslesNursing The Virus: Measles is caused by a singlestranded, enveloped RNA virus wi th 1 serotype. It is classified as a member of the genus Morbillivirus in the Paramy xoviridaefamily. Humans are the only natural hosts of measles virusMeaslesNursing Background: In the decade before the live measles vaccine was licensed in 1963, an average of 549,000 measles cases and 495 measles deaths were reported annu ally in the United States. However, it is likely that, on average, 3 to 4 m illion people were infected with measles annually; most cases were not reported. O f the reported cases, approximately 48,000 people were hospitalized from measl es and 1,000 people developed chronic disability from acute encephalitis cau sed by measles annually. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated from the United State s. Elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles virus transmission in a defined geographic area, such as a region or country, for 12 months or longer in the presence of a wellperforming surveillance system. However meas les cases and outbreaks still occur every year i n the United States because m easles is still commonly transmitted in many parts of the world, including coun tries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. Worldwide, 19 cases of measles p er 1 million persons are reported each year; an estimated 89,780 die each year.MeaslesNursing Background Continued: Since 2000, when measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. , the annual number of cases has ranged from a low of 37 in 2004 to a high o f 667 in 2014. The majority of cases have been among people who are not vaccinated against measles. Measles cases in the United States occur as a result o f importations by people who were infected while in other countries and from tran smission that may occur from those importations. Measles is more likely to spread and cause outbreaks in U.S. communities where groups of people are unvacc inated. Outbreaks in countries to which Americans often travel can dir ectly contribute to an increase in measles cases in the United States. In recent ye ars, measles importations have come from frequently visited countries, inclu ding, but not limited to, England, France, Germany, India, and the Philippine s, where large outbreaks were reported.MeaslesNursing Complications: Common complications from measles include otitis media, bronch opneumonia, laryngotracheobronchitis, and diarrhea. Even in previously healthy children, measles can cause serious illness requiring hospitalization. - One out of every 1,000 measles cases will develop acute enceph alitis, which often results in permanent brain damage. - One or two out of every 1,000 children who become infected wit h measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. - Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare, but fata l degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by behavior al and intellectual deterioration and seizures that generally develop 7 to 10 years after measles infection.MeaslesNursing People at High Risk for Complications: People at high risk for severe illness and complications from m easles include: - Infants and children aged <5 years- Adults aged >20 years-P r e g n a n t w o m e n- People with compromised immune systems, such as from leukemia and HIV infectionMeaslesNursing Transmission: Measles is one of the most contagious of all infectious diseas es; approximately 9 out of 10 susceptible persons wi th close contact to a measles p atient will develop measles. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infect ious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sn eezes. Measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours afte r an infected person leaves an area.MeaslesNursing Diagnosis and Laboratory Testing: Healthcare providers should consider measles in patients prese nting with febrile rash illness and clinically compatible measles symptoms, especi ally if the person recently traveled internationally or was exposed to a person wi th febrile rash illness. Healthcare providers should report suspected measles c ases to their local health department within 24 hours. Laboratory confirmation is essential for all sporadic measles cases and all outbreaks. Detection of measlesspecific IgM antibody and measl es RNA by real time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) are the most common met hods for confirming measles infection. Healthcare providers should obtai n both a serum sample and a throat swab (or nasopharyngeal swab) from patients suspected to have measles at first contact with them. Urine samples may also contain virus, and when feasible to do so, collecting both respiratory and urine s amples can increase the likelihood of detecting measles virus.MeaslesNursing Diagnosis and Laboratory Testing Continued: Molecular analysis can also be conducted to determine the geno type of the measles virus. Genotyping is used to map the transmission pathw ays of measles viruses. The genetic data can help to link or unlink cases and can suggest a source for imported cases. Genotyping is the only way to distinguish b etween wildtype measles virus infection and a rash caused by a recent measles v accination.MeaslesNursing Evidence of Immunity: Acceptable presumptive evidence of immunity against measles in cludes at least one of the following: - written documentation of adequate vaccination: - one or more doses of a measlescontaining vaccine administered on or after the first birthday for preschoolage children and adults not at high risk - two doses of measlescontaining vaccine for schoolage childre n and adults at high risk, including college students, healthcare personnel, and international travelers - laboratory evidence of immunity- laboratory confirmation of measles- birth before 1957 Healthcare providers should not accept verbal reports of vacci nation without written documentation as presumptive evidence of immunity.MeaslesNursing Evidence of Immunity: For additional details about evidence of immunity criteria, se e Table 3 in Prevention of Measles, Rubella, Congenital Rubella Syndrome, an d Mumps, 2013: Summary Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunizati on Practices (ACIP)MeaslesNursing Vaccination: Measles can be prevented with measlescontaining vaccine, whic h is primarily administered as the combination measlesmumpsrubella (MMR) vac cine. The combination measlesmumpsrubellavaricella (MMRV) vaccine can be used for children aged 12 months through 12 years for protection against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella. Singleantigen measles vaccine is not ailable. One dose of MMR vaccine is approximately 93% effective at prev enting measles; two doses are approximately 97% effective. Almost everyone who does not respond to the measles component of the first dose of MMR vacci ne at age 12 months or older will respond to the second dose. Therefore, the second dose of MMR is administered to address primary vaccine failure [1].MeaslesNursing Vaccination Recommendations: Children: CDC recommends routine childhood immunization for MMR vaccine starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second d ose at 4 through 6 years of age or at least 28 days following the first dose. Students at posthigh school education institutions: Students at posthigh school educational institutions without evidence of measles immunity need two doses of MMR vaccine, with the second dose ad ministered no earlier than 28 days after the first dose. Adults People who are born during or a fter 1957 who do not have evide nce of immunity against measles should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine.MeaslesNursing Vaccination Recommendations Continued: International Travelers: People 6 months of age or older who will be traveling internat ionally should be protected against measles. Before travelling internationally, - Infants 6 through 11 months of age should receive one dose of MMR vaccine - Children 12 months of age or older should have documentation o f two doses of MMR vaccine (the first dose of MMR vaccine should be administered at age 12 months or older; the second dose no earl ier than 28 days after the first dose) - Teenagers and adults born durin g or after 1957 without evidenc e of immunity against measles should have documentation of two doses of MMR vaccine, with the second dose administered no earlier than 28 days after the first doseMeaslesNursing Vaccination Recommendations Continued: Healthcare Personnel: Healthcare personnel should have documented evidence of immuni ty against measles, according to the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices[48 pages] . Some people should not get MMR vaccine. For information about contraindications, see who should NOT get vaccinated with MMR vaccine?MeaslesNursing PostExposure Prophylaxis: People exposed to measles who cannot readily show that they ha ve evidence of immunity against measles should be offered postexposure prophy laxis (PEP) or be excluded from the setting (school, hospital, childcare). MMR va ccine, if administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, or im munoglobulin (IG), if administered within six days of exposure, may provide some prot ection or modify the clinical course of disease among persons.MeaslesNursing PostExposure Prophylaxis Continued: MMR vaccine as postexposure prophylaxis - If MMR vaccine is not administered within 72 hours of exposure as PEP, MMR vaccine should still be offered at any interval following e xposure to the disease in order to offer protection from future exposures. People who receive MMR vaccine or IG as PEP should be monitored for signs and symptoms consistent with measles for at least one incubation pe riod. - If many measles cases are occurring among infants younger than 12 months of age, measles vaccination of infants as young as 6 mon ths of age may be used as an outbreak control measure. Note that children vaccinated before their first birthday should be revaccinated w hen they are 12 through 15 months old and again when they are 4 through 6 ye ars of age. - Except in healthcare settings, unvaccinated people who receive their first dose of MMR vaccine within 72 hours after exposure may return t o childcare, school, or work.MeaslesNursing PostExposure Prophylaxis Continued: Immunoglobulin (IG) as postexposure prophylaxis - People who are at risk for severe illness and complications fr om measles, such as infants younger than 12 months of age, pregnant women w ithout evidence of measles immunity, and people with severely compromi sed immune systems, should receive IG. Intramuscular IG (IGIM) shou ld be given to all infants younger than 12 months of age who have bee n exposed to measles. For infants aged 6 through 11 months, MMR vaccine c an be given in place of IG, if administered within 72 hours of exposu re. Because pregnant women might be at higher risk for severe measles and complications, intravenous IG (IGIV) should be administered to pregnant women without evidence of measles immunity who have been expose d to measles. People with severely compromised immune systems who ar e exposed to measles should receive IGIV regardless of immunologi c or vaccination status because they might not be protected by MMR v accine.MeaslesNursing PostExposure Prophylaxis Continued: Immunoglobulin (IG) as postexposure - IG should not be used to control measles outbreaks, but rather to reduce the risk for infection and complic ations in the people receivin g it. IGIM can be given to other people who do not have evidence of immunity a gainst measles, but priority should be given to people exposed in sett ings with intense, prolonged, close contact, such as a household, daycare , or classroom where the risk of transmission is highest. - After receipt of IG, people cannot return to healthcare settin gs. In other settings, such as childcare, school, or work, factors such as i mmune status, intense or prolonged contact, and presence of populations at ri sk, should be taken into consideration before allowing people to return. T hese factors may decrease the effectiveness of IG or increase the risk of di sease and complications depending on the setting to which they are return ing. - The recommended dose of IGIM is 0.5 mL/kg of body weight (maxi mum dose = 15 mL) and the recommended dose of IGIV is 400 mg/kg.MeaslesNursing PostExposure Prophylaxis Continued: Postexposure prophylaxis for healthcare personnel - If a healthcare provider without evidence of immunity is expos ed to measles, MMR vaccine should be given within 72 hours, or IG sho uld be given within 6 days when available. Exclude healthcare personne l without evidence of immunity from duty from day 5 after first exposure to day 21 after last exposure, regardless of postexposure vaccine. [1]MeaslesNursing Isolation Infected people should be isolated for four days after they de velop a rash; airborne precautions should be followed in healthcare settings. Regardle ss of presumptive immunity status, all healthcare staff entering the room should use respiratory protection consistent with airborne infection control precautio ns (use of an N95 respirator or a respirator with similar effectiveness in preven ting airborne transmission). Because of the possibility, albeit low, of MMR v accine failure in healthcare providers exposed to infected patients, they should all observe airborne precautions in caring for patients with measles. The preferred placement for patients who require airborne precautions is in a singlepatien t airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) People without evidence of immunity who have been exempted fro m measles vaccination for medical, religious, or other reasons and who do not receive appropriate PEP within the appropriate timeframe should be excl uded from affected institutions in the outbreak area until 21 days after the onset of rash in the last case of measles.MeaslesNursing Treatment There is no specific antiviral therapy for measles. Medical ca re is supportive and to help relieve symptoms and address complications such as bacteri al infections. Severe measles cases among children, such as those who are hos pitalized, should be treated with vitamin A. Vitamin A should be administered imm ediately on diagnosis and repeated the next day. The recommended agespecif ic daily doses are - 50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months of age- 100,000 IU for infants 6-11 months of age- 200,000 IU for children 12 months "}
