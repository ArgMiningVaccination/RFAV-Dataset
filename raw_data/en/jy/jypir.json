It is commonly known as balsam pear, bitter gourd, bitter melon, karela, or kugua. Its fruit has been used as a vegetable for thousands of years. It is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. It is called 'bitter melon' or 'bitter gourd' as the entire plant, including the fruit, tastes very bitter. Karela is widely cultivated in countries like India, China, Japan, Malaya, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Colombia, Brazil, Amazon, Cuba, East Africa, Haiti, Ghana, Mexico, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Panama, Middle East, Central and South America.1 The vernacular names of Karela are Tamil.2 In my opinion, karela with a bit of a tangy taste, might actually benefit the immune cells.

Its antidiabetic effect is tested in both animals and humans. When tested in an animal model, the entire plant, including fruit pulp and seed, showed potential antidiabetic property. Its fruit was found to have more potential effects on diabetes. It might either control the release of insulin or may change the metabolism of glucose.5 Karela contains a few chemicals, including glycoside, charantin, vicine, karavilosides, and polypeptide-p (plant insulin). These chemicals might improve blood sugar levels by raising the glucose uptake and synthesis of glycogen in the liver, fat, and muscles cells.6 Kindly consult a doctor for the proper diagnosis and treatment of serious conditions such as diabetes. Please do not sefl-medicate. Based on my observations, karela has two tasty options: young shoots and not-quite-ripe fruits. The fruits are bitter, but you may make them less bitter by blanching or soaking them in salty water. Inside the yellow fruits, you find a treasure trove of good stuff like carotenoids, iron, phosphorous, and vitamin C. [Dr. Rajeev Singh, BAMS] The phenolic compounds in karela are a potentially excellent natural source of food antioxidants. Phenolic compounds might have the ability to lower cholesterol, blood pressure, and the incidence of heart-related diseases and cancer.5 However, more research is required. The karela extract might help modify the signalling pathways involved in breast cancer. It might block the growth of breast cancer cells and may be used as a dietary supplement to help against breast cancer. The fruits, green leaves, stems, and seeds of karela have several active proteins and steroids. These proteins might have potential anticancer activity.5 However, serious conditions such as cancer should be diagnosed and treated by a doctor. Therefore, consult a doctor and do not self-medicate. From what I have know and read, karela is a versatile plant that can be included in our diet for better health! It is not only tasty but also may have medicinal benefits. It might keep worms away, relieve pain, help with haemorrhoids, and even soothe rashes.

Various studies have confirmed that several species of karela might have antimalarial properties.6 A series of abnormalities linked with diabetes and delayed wound healing are lowered immune response, reduced formation of new blood vessels, deficiency of growth factors, and reduced production of collagen. When karela fruit ointment was applied to the rat (diabetic rat), it showed a potential to improve wound closure and may help enhance a gene that helps in cell growth. Therefore, it might be beneficial for the healing of the wound.1 However, more research is required to prove such effects on humans. Though there are studies that show the Potential uses of karela in various conditions, these are insufficient and there is a need for further studies to establish the true extent of the benefits of karela on human health. I came across a fascinating study that revealed something amazing about karela. According to the study, karela extract may have the power to speed up the healing process of gastric ulcers in rats. However, it's important to note that studies on humans are needed to confirm these exciting claims.
