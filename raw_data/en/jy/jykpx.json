The importance of [detoxification](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/2021/01/19/how-to-detox/) and the need to rid the body of various toxic heavy metals and organic chemicals has already [been discussed](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/2021/01/19/how-to-detox/). Avoidance A key thing to consider when detox is the avoidance of the toxin, to begin with! Simple avoidance measures will keep these harmful chemicals out of the body and decrease the need for more intensive forms of detox. Food It probably goes without saying that there are lots of toxins in our food and we consume these on a daily basis. Eating organic is probably one of the greatest recommendations we can make for the avoidance of toxicity. Also, we know that eating more of a plant-based diet has a greater detoxifying effect on the body and keeps the body alkaline, which aids in overall detox. If you are eating more of a Keto or Paleo approach, definitely consider eating organic meats and grass-fed meats, wild-caught fish, and cage-free eggs, as these have been shown to contain fewer toxins. Also, remember that any food which is processed contains a higher level of toxicity and should be avoided. This includes all packaged foods and therefore only whole foods should be consumed. Alcohol should be restricted to one or two drinks a week if at all. Sugar and sweet foods and drinks should be avoided. Water One of the most important things to do is to filter your water. To get an understanding of what toxins could be in your tap water, enter your ZIP Code here ( [https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/)). Many people think that they can have clean water just from drinking filtered water from the refrigerator or from a Brita filter. Unfortunately, these filters do not capture all of the potential toxins such as glyphosate and fluoride, and therefore you could be getting exposed on a daily basis. Therefore, considering upgrading it to a more advanced filtration system such as Berkey ( [https://www.berkeyfilters.com/)](https://www.berkeyfilters.com/) or reverse osmosis. Now, the problem with reverse osmosis is that it takes out all of the minerals in the water and those need to be replaced. Also unfortunately that if routine maintenance is not applied to the reverse osmosis system that it can grow out mold (because there is can be stagnant water in a tank). Additionally, it takes a lot of water to produce one tank of reverse osmosis water and this can run up the water bills and the to inefficiencies. Therefore one of the filters that we like is the [Clearly F](https://www.clearlyfiltered.com/) [iltered](https://www.clearlyfiltered.com/) water system, which filters out 99+% of all toxins but also retains the minerals. To take filtration to the highest level would mean that you would also need to obtain a whole house water filter. This is because just because their water is filtered at the tap does not mean that you are not getting exposed to other sources such as the shower, which can expose you to harmful chlorinated compounds. These compounds can get into your system and disrupt gut health as well as hormones etc.. Now if you want to take things even further there are many novelty water offerings (but also expensive) that we have found to be helpful for detox. These contain super oxygen-rich waters that can give you a great deal of detox ability and energy throughout the day. We also think there is some merit to drinking alkaline water in between meals for detox. For more detail, please contact our office for more info. Air Because we spend so much time indoor and spend so much time in re-recirculated air, we need to think about purifying our air system. Also note that many homes have some low-level mold, bacteria, and viral (aka biotoxin) activity which can be harmful. There are also things like volatile organics, carbon monoxide, radon, and other things to assess and monitor for in our air. Keep in mind that many harmful chemicals attached to dust particles and if we breathe in these dust particles we can become toxic. Often these dust particles can accumulate on the inside of the HVAC ductwork as well as the filter. It is not good enough just to change the filter---you must clean the ductwork and you would need a professional to do this. If you are in the Atlanta area we recommend ZeroRez. In addition to this, consider getting a good air whole house filtration system for your home. ZeroRez installs one that has an ultraviolet light that kills all germs and dust in the home. In addition to this, we have found that filters such as [Molekule](https://molekule.com/), [IQAir](https://www.iqair.com/us/), and [Vollara](https://www.vollara.com/TreeofLightHealth). Our favorite is the [Air and Surface Pro by Vollara](https://www.vollara.com/TreeofLightHealth) as it also has an optional ozone feature. For more information and purchasing go to Vollara. To explore the air quality in your area, click [here](https://www.iqair.com/). Plastics Plastics contain many harmful compounds that are estrogenic in nature and disrupt thyroid and other hormones. This includes chemicals like bisphenol a and styrene. You should not store your food or water in plastic containers and move to more glass and ceramic. One of the worst things you can do is heat something in soft plastic or styrofoam... You would get a big dose of environmental toxins if you do so! Cosmetics Many cosmetics, hair dyes, shampoos, soaps, etc. contain chemicals such as Phthalates that are harmful to human physiology. Therefore we recommend only purchasing natural cosmetics that do not contain harmful chemicals. Hair dyes ideally should be avoided. Look for shampoos and soaps that do not contain harmful ingredients for foreign chemicals but only natural ingredients. Aluminum Aluminum has been linked to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Certain antiperspirants and deodorants contain aluminum. You should avoid drinking out of aluminum cans and cooking on aluminum foil. Therefore we recommend avoiding any antiperspirant or deodorant that contains aluminum. The one we like is Tom's of Maine which is aluminum-free. Unfortunately, for reasons that are rather controversial, we find aluminum in the lung tissue from the air we breathe. Therefore we suggest doing some form of aluminum detox on a daily basis. Bis-Phenol A (BPA) This toxic chemical is known to have a deleterious effect on the thyroid, hormones, and other tissues of the body. One way to know if a can is BPA lined is to see if it has a white inner coating. BPA can more easily leach into cans if the can has acidic contents (such as Tomatoes or Tomato soup, which tend to be acidic). BPA is what makes plastic soft and pliable and can leach into water and foods when heated. Many of the whitish receipts from the grocery store and/or gas pumps contain BPA and therefore should be avoided. Never drink water out of a plastic bottle that has been in the sun, for example, or drink any water from a plastic bottle that leaves a plastic taste in the mouth. Cookware Teflon cookware is achieved with a coating of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), which is a plastic polymer that starts to leach toxins when heated. Therefore, we do not recommend cooking with Teflon or similar cookware and recommend cooking with ceramic cookware instead. Fluoride Fluoride has been linked to many toxic effects in the brain and therefore should be avoided. Since most municipal water contains fluoride your water should be filtered to remove fluoride. In addition, you should switch to fluoride-free toothpaste. Again Tom's of Maine is recommended. Glyphosate: Consider that glyphosate is in almost every bite of food and water than you take in. [Certain foods](https://www.nestandglow.com/life/glyphosate-in-food) such as Garbonzo beans have a [high Glyphosate level](https://www.nestandglow.com/life/glyphosate-in-food). The good news is that if you eat non-GMO organic this greatly reduces the glyphosate in the food. Invest in an advanced water filtration system to reduce your Glyphosate exposure. Consider supplementing with Humic Acids (Peat extracts) to prevent Glyphosate absorption in the gut. Avoid extended time in places where Glyphosate may be sprayed: golf courses treated lawns, treated agricultural areas, etc. Hidden Toxic Gases Certain odorless gases such as Radon and Carbon Monoxide, even at low levels have been shown to have deleterious health effects. We recommend getting your home tested for Radon and routinely monitoring for Carbon Monoxide. Household Chemicals: Roundup and/or Glyphosate should not be used. Instead, consider alternative weed killers and natural alternatives. Additionally, consider switching all surface cleaners, detergents, and other household items to natural alternatives such as ECO, Seventh Generation, Meyers, and others. See [this article](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/natural-eco-friendly-cleaning-products-for-the-conscious-home) for more info. Salt Believe it or not, many sea salts on the market such as Himalayan Sea Salt (the one with the pink flakes in it) that have been touted to be good for you [may contain heavy metals such as Mercury, Thallium, Arsenic, and other toxins](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/pink-himalayan-sea-salt-an-update/). We have validated the toxicity of several salt brands using our testing, and therefore, we recommend only using Morton's salt for now until more studies are done. Heavy Metals: We have already discussed the harmful nature of heavy metals and dental amalgams in other articles. These silver fillings or amalgams have been shown to leech out harmful mercury and other heavy metals over time, leading to chronic, low-level mercury toxicity. If you have dental amalgams, we recommend that you have them removed by a biological dentist. Never consider removing your amalgams without consulting with the professional. If you have Mercury amalgams please [contact us](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/contact/) for more information. ElectroSmog We are surrounded by unnatural frequencies emitted from cell phones, cell towers, routers, smart meters, and even the electricity in our homes. These frequencies disrupt the natural detox ability of the body and therefore we recommend some form of EMF mitigation for everyone especially for those who are dealing with chronic illness. This is a very advanced topic and there is lots of information to convey. Please [contact](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/contact/) our office for more information. Stress If there are high levels of stress in your life, your body will not be relaxed enough to detox. As always we recommend stress management techniques such as yoga, meditation, exercise, etc. we realize that sometimes it is not possible to do so in our busy modern world. Therefore we have come up with novel approaches to manage stress. Please [contact](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/contact/) our office for more information. How to determine your toxicity level Before engaging in any detox program, we recommend getting tested to determine your overall toxicity load. Based on this we can determine what kind of detox methods are needed, the level of detox needed, as well as the duration of any detox effort. There are two ways to determine your toxicity levels. The more common (but expensive) way is to perform [functional laboratory testing](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/functional-laboratory-testing/). In general, we recommend getting tested for Glyphosate, Heavy Metals, and Environmental Toxins. Although these tests are expensive, the pricing is coming down and it can be very beneficial to establish a baseline and to determine the level of detox needed. The other more eloquent way to determine one's toxicity level is to use [Advanced Biofeedback](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/advanced-biofeedback/) Methods. This allows us to determine which organs are affected, how they are affected, and which detox methods work best. Keep in mind that laboratory testing may not pick up various toxins due to many technical reasons. [Biofeedback](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/advanced-biofeedback/) gives gets around this problem and does so at a fraction of the cost. To determine your toxicity load via either of these methods, please [contact](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/contact/) our office for more information. Your genetics play a major role in how you detox You may have heard how some people, well into advanced age, can drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, and never get sick; whereas others, who eat right, exercise and do everything seemingly right, develop autoimmune disease or even cancer at a young age. The reason is that due to our genetics, some people have the ability to detox better than others. Therefore, we highly recommend getting a thorough [genetics evaluation](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/nutrigenomics/) to determine your ability to detox. If you are interested in a [genetics evaluation](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/nutrigenomics/), please [contact](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/contact/) our office for further evaluation. A basic detoxification program In general, any detoxification program must be individually tailored and you must work with your provider to determine what will work best for you. As already mentioned, we highly recommend testing to determine toxicity levels as well as a genetics evaluation before considering any detox plan. Therefore, consider this list of nutritional supports to be only a general guide only. Keep in mind that if you have digestive issues--leaky gut, SIBO, IBS, and others, we DO NOT recommend you engage in a detox plan without further evaluation. Similarly, if you have heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune disease, dental amalgams, neurological disease, Lyme disease, and/or mold illness, we DO NOT recommend you engage in any intensive detox effort without [consulting with us](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/contact/) first. |Chlorella* (always check sensitivity)||Toxin tab, three Kidney Support (if needed)* Dandelion, Milk Thistle, etc.||Organ Drainage, Support Detoxification organs||Daily| taking professional-grade supplements that are toxin, filler, and preservative-free. Please [contact](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/contact/) our office for more information. 1.) Footbath detox. There are many detox modalities, but the most powerful that many have found who are dealing with chronic health challenges is the foot detox. It is a gentle, extremely effective way to detox the body. Unfortunately, foot detox systems can run into the thousands per unit (See [https://www.amajordifference.com](https://www.amajordifference.com/) or [https://kiscience.com/product/ki-science-hydrogen-detox-foot-spa/](https://kiscience.com/product/ki-science-hydrogen-detox-foot-spa/).). However, many do perfectly fine with a much cheaper version from Dyna-Chi, which uses the same technology, just without all of the bells and whistles: [https://www.ebay.com/itm/Max-Detox-Ionic-Detox-Cleanse-Bath-Foot-Spa-with-2-bar-4-plates-MAX-Array/200989667219?hash=item2ecbeaef93:g:n7YAAOSwmoVaoFpT](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Max-Detox-Ionic-Detox-Cleanse-Bath-Foot-Spa-with-2-bar-4-plates-MAX-Array/200989667219?hash=item2ecbeaef93:g:n7YAAOSwmoVaoFpT) For consistent detox, if tolerated, many need to do a 30 to 60-minute foot bath every 3 to four days. The reason for this is that the footbath stimulates all of the drainage organs of the body (especially the Lymphatics), with day 3 after doing the footbath as the day most toxins are released. The footbath protocol is as follows: a). 30 minutes to one hour prior to the footbath session, take a Cilantro Tincture*. PLEASE NOTE: DO NOT TAKE CILANTRO IF YOU HAVE MERCURY AMAGLAMS. CILANTRO MAY ONLY BE USED ABOUT 6-8 WEEKS AFTER THE MERCURY AMALGAMS HAVE BEEN REMOVED. b). Follow the instructions for the footbath. It is important to use the right kind of salt. Unfortunately, we have found that Kosher Sea Salts and Himalayan sea salts contain mercury. Therefore, suggest using Morton's Iodized salt. It is also important to make sure the water is VERY hot...(the detox lessens as the temperature goes down). After the footbath, make sure you drink PLENTY of water with electrolytes. 2.) Take Binders*. Binders are substances that have the ability to grab or hold onto toxins and usher them out of the body safely, usually via the GI tract. This avoids any toxins damaging the kidneys/liver. Take various binders on an empty stomach to trap toxins as they are released into the GI tract and gallbladder...Activated Charcoal, Bentonite Clay, or Chlorella (Preferred- because it doesn't bind up good minerals, it just binds toxins). Chlorella**** comes in little pellets. 10-15 pellets equates to approximately 3-5 grams. A suggested dose is 3-5 grams two to three times daily. ****PLEASE NOTE: DO NOT TAKE CHLORELLA IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE MERCURY AMALGAMS. SUGGEST OTHER BINDERS SUCH AS CHARCOAL, BIND BY SYSTEMIC FORMULAS, BENTONITE CLAY, PC ECKLONIA KAVA, TAKESUMI SUPREME, AND OTHERS. NOTE THAT SOME ARE SENSITIVE TO CHLORELLA. WE ALWAYS RECOMMEND TESTING FIRST! 3.) Drainers*. Drainers help to pull toxins out of organs and usher them into the lymphatic drainage system. The following are examples of Juice, or various herbal combinations 2-3 times per day. There are many herbal combination formulations, so please [contact](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/contact/) our office for more information. 4.) Coffee enemas, two or three times a week (see handout) 5.) Infrared Sauna therapy, if you have access to one, once or twice per week. 6.) Exercise-Movement helps with detox and lymphatic drainage 7.) Drink Alkaline Water in between meals (or water with lemon) 8.) Eat a non-inflammatory alkaline diet, with plenty of fruits/veggies/ 9.) Food-based Multivitamin daily with B-vitamins, and Macrominerals. I would also suggest taking the 70 plus trace minerals to aid in detox. We use many different products for vitamin and mineral support. Please [contact](https://www.treeoflighthealth.com/contact/) our office for more info. *The most appropriate Binder/Drainage combinations can be determined by biofeedback testing. "}
