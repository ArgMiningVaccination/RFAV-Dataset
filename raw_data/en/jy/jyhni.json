The care and compassion he puts into his work is what sets him apart from all others. For as great of a chiropractor that he is, he's an even better human being. I wish we had more people like him. - Kim HWe love Dr Beau. He is very kind and compassionate. Recently my daughter was in a great deal of pain and he handled her with great care and gave us some very sound advice. His office is clean and I like that most of it he built himself. His staff is courteous and professional. He is very knowledgeable on spinal care, nutrition and supplements as well. I highly recommend Dr Smith for your entire family! - Tina HMy husband n I have seen many chiropractors through the years and Dr. Smith is one of the best. His compassion and care was immediately impressive and that can't be said for many in the healthcare industry currently. Thank you for helping us! |Mon:||8:00 - 11:45 AM, 3:00 - "}
