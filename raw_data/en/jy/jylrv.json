Sometimes there are techniques of meditation that integrate elements of both concentrative and opening-up meditation. Western research has primarily focused upon meditation as a clinical self-regulation strategy. This research was initially interested in the physiological changes that occur during meditation. Meditation may be conceptualized as an altered state of consciousness for inducing powerful subjective changes in one's view of one's self, of nature, and of other people. Meditation may be conceptualized as a self-regulation strategy for clinical and health-related problems. When meditation is conceptualized as a self-regulated strategy, it needs to be compared with other self-regulation strategies for its clinical effectiveness. "}
