This is a beautiful, demanding, challenging and rewarding field. Having genuine motivation for the work is so important \u2014 your patient's life will depend on it. As you explore medicine as a career possibility, make sure you ask for help from trusted sources along the way. Close, frequent communication with your premedical advisor is very important. If you do not have a premed advisor at your institution, the National Association of Advisors for the Health Professions (NAAHP) can help you find one.

Your AMCAS application is the first of a two-stage process and must be on file with AMCAS by the November 1 deadline. Applications are accepted from citizens and permanent residents of the United States and citizens of Canada only. All AMCAS applicants are invited to submit a University of Maryland School of Medicine secondary application after the AMCAS application is received. The deadline for the receipt of the secondary application is December 1. In situations where the secondary application is sent to an applicant after the December 1 deadline, the applicant will have two weeks to return the application to the School of Medicine. The secondary application fee of $80 is non-refundable. It is strongly recommended that the application forms, letters of recommendation and all other supporting credentials be filed as early as is possible in the application period. An extension of the November 1 deadline is unusual and will be granted only under the most extenuating of circumstances. Early Decision Early Decision Applications to UMSOM must be on file with AMCAS by the August 2 deadline. All Early Decision applicants will be notified of a decision on their application by October 1. [Learn more about Early Decision](#earlydecision) Application Portal Applicants will be able to complete their secondary application, upload supplemental documents, schedule their interview, conduct their interviews, and receive their Admissions decisions on the Application Portal (AMP). Secondary Application Once our office has received your verified AMCAS application, a secondary application invite email will be sent to the email address listed on your application. (If you have a Gmail account, be sure to check the junk/spam folder.) Rolling Admissions For all candidates not applying Early Decision, the application process is conducted on a rolling basis. All decisions regarding the selection process are made by a committee of current faculty and students. Each applicant's credentials are evaluated by the Committee on Admissions to determine if an interview is to be granted. All interviews are conducted at the School of Medicine and are scheduled in advance by invitation only. Interviews are conducted each week, on Mondays and Wednesdays, from September to early February. Applications may be rejected from both residents and nonresidents without an interview. Those applicants invited to interview will receive, in writing, one of three decisions from the Committee on Admissions: Accept - Applicants who are offered an acceptance will have three weeks to respond to that offer. - Accepted applicants wishing to hold a seat in the next incoming freshman class must return a non-binding contract to the Office of Admissions. - A deposit to hold a seat in the class is not required. Waitlist - Individuals placed on the Waitlist will be reviewed again after all interviews are complete and will be notified of their ranking on that list. This usually occurs in late April. - Waitlisted applicants may send updates to the Office of Admissions, at any time, regarding additional activities or accomplishments. Reject - Students who have had their application rejected will be urged to consult with their pre-medical advisor. Students may write to the Office of Admissions at any time during the application process if there are significant concerns or questions regarding the status of their application. Deferment A deferment of matriculation for one year may be granted to accepted applicants who present such a request in writing to the Committee on Admissions by June 1. An individual making such a request must present a plan of activity for the coming year that is both focused and productive in nature. An individual who is granted a deferment must re-apply through the Delayed/Deferred Program at AMCAS, and can apply only to the University of Maryland, to secure their seat for the following year. All policies and procedures for Early Decision will apply. Applicants who are accepted from the Waitlist are not eligible for deferment. Your Responsibilities The medical school application process can be a stressful time for all concerned. We respectfully request that applicants keep phone calls, letters or emails to the Office of Admissions to a minimum. Each applicant must assume responsibility for assuring that all required materials and the completed application packet are filed and received by the Committee on Admissions. If you have a question or concern about the status of your application, please [contact the office](mailto:admissions@som.umaryland.edu ) to clarify your status. The Office of Admissions will make every effort to assist with the completion of your application, within reason. All applicants are expected to respond truthfully and completely to all questions on the AMCAS and School of Medicine application forms. An applicant who provides false or misleading information during the application process will be denied admission or, if enrolled before discovery of irregularity in the application process, may be dismissed from school. Secondary Application Every applicant who submits an AMCAS application to the University of Maryland School of Medicine receives a Secondary Application. The purpose of our secondary application is to better understand our applicants and their commitment to becoming a physician. Our optional questions help us understand more clearly how our applicants' backgrounds and lived experiences contribute to the rich diversity of our class and the profession. We also include a question that allows you to explain any academic challenges you have experienced. These short essay questions allow us to better understand you and your commitment to a career in medicine: - Briefly describe your most meaningful exposure to clinical medicine. - Briefly describe your most satisfying experience related to community service. - Without limiting the discussion to your own identity, please describe how you envision contributing to the values of equity and inclusivity at our School of Medicine, and in the medical profession. - What does it mean to you to enter a profession? Letters of Recommendation Letters of recommendation are as important in the selection process as the applicant's academic credentials and MCAT scores, extracurricular activities, and essays. Applicants to the School of Medicine should seek out letters of recommendation from individuals who have both personal knowledge of the applicant's accomplishments and the insight to objectively assess the applicant's character, work ethic and motivation for a career in medicine. Members of the Committee on Admissions give little or no weight in the selection process to subjective recommendations from friends, family members and political figures. If an applicant has significant employment or military experience before, during or after college, then letters from employers, supervisors and commanding officers are appropriate as well. Policies and Procedures - A letter of recommendation from the Premedical Advisory Committee or the official Premedical Advisor is recommended and preferred if your undergraduate school has such a committee or advisor, but it is not required. If despite having a premedical committee or advisor at your institution you are still unable to have this letter sent, we recommend you: - Write a letter to the Committee on Admissions explaining why you are unable to have this letter sent and; - Ask the Premedical Committee or advisor to write to the Committee on Admissions indicating that they will not be able to send an official letter on your behalf. - All letters of recommendation must be written on official stationery and sent directly to AMCAS. If you have a recommender who does not write his/her letter on stationery we will still accept it as long as the letter comes from AMCAS. - If your school does not have a Premedical Advisory Committee, you should submit at least three letters of recommendation, and at least two of these should come from undergraduate and/or graduate school faculty whose courses you have taken. At least one letter must come from a science faculty and one from a non-science faculty. - If you are not currently enrolled as an undergraduate student and are unable to submit a composite letter of recommendation, please arrange to have at least one letter sent from each component of your education (undergraduate and graduate) and major work experience to date. - Any exceptions to the above policy will be considered on an individual basis after receipt of a written request from the applicant. Re-Application If you are reapplying to the School of Medicine, the Committee on Admissions highly recommends that you submit updated letters of recommendation. In addition, you should also submit letters from experiences undertaken since your previous application. Your Responsibilities Please remember that it is your responsibility to be sure that the above requirements are met. You are also responsible for requesting your letters of recommendation so that they are received by our deadline of January 15. If you are applying as an Early Decision candidate, your letters of recommendation must be received by August 31. Applications that continue to miss letters of recommendation will be considered incomplete when they are reviewed by the Committee on Admissions. This will have a direct impact on the disposition of your application. Academic Requirements The successful University of Maryland School of Medicine applicant optimizes their undergraduate and graduate education experiences by exploring personal areas of academic interest and life passions through curricular and extracurricular activities.

Students in the process of applying for permanent resident (PR) status are welcome to apply to the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Their application will be reviewed only after they have obtained their green card. It is the responsibility of the applicant to contact the Office of Admissions to notify us of their updated visa status and provide appropriate confirming documentation. As a state-assisted medical school, the University of Maryland gives preference in the selection process to residents of Maryland. However, a significant number of non-resident applicants are invited to interview and accepted to enter each freshman class. The School of Medicine welcomes applications from individuals who reside throughout the United States and Canada. Diversity is highly valued in the educational process and applications are encouraged from individuals from nontraditional and disadvantaged backgrounds. The University of Maryland School of Medicine does not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, protected veteran's status, physical or mental disability, or age in its selection process. [UMB Notice of Non-Discrimination](https://www.umaryland.edu/policies-and-procedures/library/administration/policies/vi-100c.php) Applicant Selection Criteria The decisions of the Committee on Admissions are based on several criteria. These criteria have been developed by the faculty of the School of Medicine and are closely allied to the school's academic mission and goals. The School of Medicine will admit only those individuals who have documented that they possess the ability to successfully complete the academically rigorous curriculum and the personal characteristics that we would all like to see in our own physicians. Academic excellence is expected. However, acceptance is not guaranteed on the basis of excellent grades and MCAT scores alone. Each application undergoes a thorough holistic review. The Committee on Admissions seeks out evidence for the following qualities in the applicant's personal statement, in their extracurricular activities and life experiences, and in letters of recommendation from premedical advisors and others who know the applicant well: - Psychological maturity - Character and integrity - Self discipline - Adaptability and flexibility - Good judgment - Excellent communication skills - Empathy and concern for helping others - Intellectual curiosity - Appropriate motivation for a career in medicine - Leadership skills - Commitment to excellence Your Activities Applicants should use the Personal Comments section of the AMCAS application to discuss selected extracurricular activities and life experiences, and the relevance of each in their decision to pursue a medical career. There are no prescriptive activities that will guarantee acceptance to our medical school. Each applicant is encouraged to pursue activities that will demonstrate their special talents and which will support their motivation for a career in medicine. Exposure to clinical medicine, and knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of medicine as a career, are expected. Research experience and community service are highly valued by the Committee on Admissions. Activities pursued for fun and relaxation are important. Students should pursue activities which they find to be personally fulfilling and enjoyable. The quality, rather than quantity, of these experiences should be emphasized. Interview Selection Applications may be rejected from both residents and non-residents without an interview. Those applicants who possess competitive academic records and the personal characteristics noted above may be invited to interview. The interview provides the candidate with an opportunity to discuss their personal history and motivation for a medical career and any aspect of their application that merits special attention or explanation. Candidates should be prepared to discuss any and all aspects of their application. Interviewers are trained to specifically evaluate an applicant's maturity, adequacy of support systems, level of confidence in their abilities, intellectual curiosity, communication skills, motivation for medicine, depth of involvement in extracurricular activities, and professional bearing during the interview, among other factors. Applicants are expected to possess excellent communication skills, to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable about a career in medicine and to conduct themselves in an appropriate fashion during the inteview. The interview evaluations are the last important factor considered by the members of the Committee on Admissions in their deliberations regarding each applicant's candidacy for admission. Early Decision Program [The University of Maryland School of Medicine has an Early Decision Program for applicants who are sure that their first choice of medical schools is the University of Maryland. The Committee on Admissions interviews selected Early Decision applicants and makes a decision on these students before considering the regular pool of applicants.] By applying for Early Decision, the highly qualified applicant avoids having to make numerous other applications. Applicants with less competitive academic credentials, or those without the support of their premedical advisor, are discouraged from applying through this program. The Early Decision applicant must apply only to this school by the AMCAS deadline of August 2. That means you must submit your application and all transcripts by August 2. Applicants must provide all supplementary information (secondary application, updated MCAT scores, and letters of recommendation) by August 31. Interviews will take place at the medical school in mid-September. No one will be accepted without an interview. If offered an acceptance by this school, the applicant cannot apply elsewhere. All decisions for this program are made by October 1. The Committee on Admissions can make one of three decisions for each Early Decision applicant: - acceptance - rejection - placement into the regular applicant pool for review at a later date Each applicant will be notified promptly of the decision of the Committee on Admissions so that those not accepted through this program can apply elsewhere. Individuals who apply through the Early Decision Program cannot apply to any other medical school until they are notified that they have not been accepted through this program at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Applicant Responsibilities - Applicants are expected to conduct themselves in an ethical and professional manner at all times. - Applicants are expected to become familiar with ALL requirements for admission to the School of Medicine and to have satisfied those requirements at the time an application for admission is made or, if applicable, by the time of matriculation. - Applicants are expected to review the School of Medicine's Technical Standards (The Essential Requirements for Admission, Academic Advancement and Graduation) and to contact the Office of Admissions with any questions or concerns. - Applicants are expected to become familiar with and observe our application procedures.

In those instances when an applicant cannot appear for a scheduled interview, the applicant is responsible for notifying the School of Medicine of the cancellation of the appointment. The cancellation should be undertaken by sending an email to [admissionscommittee@som.umaryland.edu](mailto:admissionscommittee@som.umaryland.edu). - Applicants must respond in a timely manner to offers of acceptance to the School of Medicine. Applicants will have three weeks from the date of the letter of acceptance to respond to the School of Medicine's offer of admission. Failure to respond will result in the withdrawal of the letter of acceptance. - Applicants must notify the School of Medicine in writing of any change in the status of their application (e.g., the withdrawal of the application, a request to defer matriculation, etc.) - Applicants who have multiple acceptances must withdraw from all but their first choice of medical school by April 30; May 1 for MD/PhD Programs. - Applicants in need of financial aid must initiate the steps necessary to determine their eligibility as soon as is possible. These steps include filing the appropriate Need Analysis forms in January or February, and encouraging parents (if required) to file income tax forms early. Technical Standards Academic Advancement and Graduation The mission of the University of Maryland School of Medicine Doctor of Medicine (MD) program is to provide an inclusive learning environment that develops lifelong learners who are clinically excellent and possess humanism, professionalism, scholarship, leadership, critical thinking and attention to social justice and diversity.
