While no clinical guidelines advise to do so, are antibody tests the right means to check if your vaccine is working? Are there benefits to getting it done? [readmore](javascript://) 02/6What are antibody tests? How do they work? Antibody tests, or serology tests determine the igG and igM proteins created by the immune system. They are usually done to detect if the body had a past infection with COVID-19, and has defensive antibodies in place. In a way, they also determine the level of protective immunity an individual may have and hence, a measure some people are now rampantly depending upon before and after COVID-19 vaccination to check how protected they are, and see if the vaccine is actually doing its job well.

A negative or a lower number may indicate that a person doesn't have enough antibodies and vice versa. While there's no direct correlation between antibody tests and vaccination, the test can help determine the level of defensive immune-antibodies mounted by the COVID vaccine after administration. Thus, it is being used as a diagnostic tool to check whether or not the vaccine is working. [readmore](javascript://) 03/6Are there benefits to getting it done? Clinically, antibody tests can help give a person a picture of how protected they are, and the level of antibodies that may be present. One of the reasons why many are preferring to get it done right now is because of the rampant spread of virulent strains, some of which are said to considerably evade antibodies, and lower efficacy and know how well-protected they are, after getting the COVID-19 jab. However, in the case of COVID-19 vaccination, experts do caution against the indiscriminate use of the tests, adding that they may not be actually that helpful to get done after being vaccinated. [readmore](javascript://) 04/6Here's why While serological tests have their own benefits and limitations, do remember that they aren't one-size-fits-all. Depending on the time you get the test done, for example, can indicate different, or miscalculated results. Antibodies post a COVID infection, or a vaccine can take a while to show up (10-14 days). Getting the test done before time may show a wrong result, or show you have no immunity, despite the body actively doing its work. Secondly, antibody tests may not also be an accurate tool to detect vaccine-generated antibodies since the time immunity peaks, or the time it may last can differ from individual to individual, and depend on a lot of factors. For example- old age, pre-existing health conditions, gender, chronic conditions or a dysfunctional immune system can make one person have lower antibodies, in comparison to someone else. Hence, getting an antibody test done, in such a case may not give the most accurate description of how fairly protected you are. Experts also say that completely relying on antibody tests may not be such a wise idea because all coronavirus vaccines which have been approved for use do carry some level of protection, and have been scientifically tested to be effective. Thus, getting tested might just be an exaggeration and not complete proof that the vaccine is working or not. It can also happen that serological tests available right now look for different antibodies, for example, the ones generated after natural infection and infer wrong results. Therefore, while some may need it (if advised by the doctor or known to have prior immuno-suppressing conditions), antibody testing is not a routine recommendation in all vaccination cases.

For example, while Covishield (Oxford-Astrazeneca) is said to mount stronger antibodies with the first dose, Covaxin needs a shorter second dose to do the same. However, both vaccines are completely effective and well-tolerable. Therefore, simply referring to the number of antibodies you have may not signify how effective the vaccine is. Simply said, if you have received a COVID-19 vaccine that has been authorized for use, and passes clinical guidelines, be rest assured that the vaccine is working well, as it should be.

Here's what a doctor wants you to know](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/covaxin-vs-covishield-coronavirus-vaccine-is-covaxin-better-than-covishield-or-vice-versa-heres-what-a-doctor-wants-you-to-know/articleshow/82766493.cms) In a similar way, it can also happen that some people, who have immunity-limiting conditions may not be able to mount stipulated antibodies. Even so, without antibodies, the vaccine may be working for them and guarantees them some level of protection. Similarly, experts have also warned that misinterpreting antibody test results could lead people to take fewer precautions than necessary, or cause needless worry.

What's more important right now is to continue to take the pandemic seriously, follow all COVID-appropriate behaviour, and get both the jabs of the vaccine, as and when scheduled. Taking an antibody test may also be a decision that is best determined by your doctor and greatly depends on the pre-conditions you have, since the results can vary from person to person. Therefore, follow due diligence, and make an informed call.
