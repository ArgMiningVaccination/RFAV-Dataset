However, for many conditions, such as fatigue, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and menstrual irregularities, there is not a clear cause or medical solution. A functional medicine approach evaluates the whole person based on a number of factors which may contribute to health conditions, such as nutritional deficiencies, dietary intolerance, toxicity, abnormal gut microbiome (the healthy bacteria we all carry), hormonal dysfunction, and inflammation. Specialized testing can confirm the areas causing an individual to experience difficulties. These imbalances can be addressed through changes in diet, the judicious use of supplements, and stress management techniques. This approach can also contribute to the care for individuals with chronic health conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes. "}
