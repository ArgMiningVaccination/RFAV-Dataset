This would not be possible without the participation of Canadian paediatricians, subspecialists and other health-care providers in the monthly collection of information on rare paediatric conditions, our principal investigators who review and analyze the data to provideknowledge and educational solutions, and the guidance of our Steering Committee members. W e thank them all. For their role in the verification of data collected, we thank: Canadian Association of Paediatric Health Centres Canadian Institute for Health Information Canadian Paediatric Decision Support Network IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) centres Notifiable Diseases Reporting System, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Public Health Agency of Canada W e also gratefully acknowledge the financial support received to maintain and expand the program. A summary of supporters is found in this report (page 8). The strong partnership between the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) allows the CPSP to grow in Canada and to take a leadership role on the international scene. A special thank you Dr. Susan King is a leader in paediatric surveillance. A very active and valued member of the CPS Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee and the CPSP Steering Committee, Dr. King has always provided excellent infectious disease expertise and has been greatly appreciated for her astuteness and insightwhen reviewing study proposals. As a coordinator of the Canadian Perinatal HIV Surveillance Program, a major accomplishment was ensuring that epidemiological research informationconfirming the effectiveness of early intervention was actually integrated into public health practice with affected groups. Her strong commitment to and experience in collecting accurate clinical information, while scrupulously respecting individual privacy and professional confidentiality, are tremendous contributions not only to the CPSP but to allchildren and youth with uncommon high-impact conditions. Through her vision and actions, Dr. Susan King created a world where the meaning of \"caring\" is truly expressed. What an inviting path. What a lady!Dr. Susan King \"CPSP's greatest strength is collecting national data in a timely manner.\" 3C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Foreword Federal Minister of Health As Minister of Health, I would like to congratulate and thank the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) for the successful completion of the 2004 Canadian Paediatric SurveillanceProgram (CPSP). The coordination of the surveillance activities by the CPS, and the contributions from the network of more than 2,400 paediatricians, make this program a success. The CPSP is a valuable tool for the surveillance of rare childhood conditions. The knowledge generated through the program facilitates research and advances awarenessand education within the medical profession, improving the quality of care of children with rare conditions. The Government of Canada is working with partners in the provinces and territories to renew our health-care system and ensure that all Canadians have access to quality care. The knowledge and commitment of paediatricians across Canada, and the contributions from professional organizations like the CPS, will continue to play a key rolein the attainment of these objectives. Congratulations and thank you for your continued efforts.The Honourable Ujjal Dosanjh Chief Public Health Officer of Canada I am pleased to accept the ninth annual report of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP), an important collaborative tool for surveillance, research and policy development. It is especially commendable that the epidemiological data generated through the program is used as a catalyst for providing information to physicians to raiseawareness and improve treatment of rare diseases and conditions affecting children. That is why I am pleased that the Public Health Agency of Canada, through the Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control (CIDPC), partners with the Canadian Paediatric Society on this initiative. The Agency was established in September 2004 to serve as the focal point for research and expertise on public health issues, including disease surveillance, by working closely with provinces and territories and otherstakeholders to improve the overall health of Canadians. I would like to personally thank the Agency's staff who have contributed to the success of this program by serving as principal investigators, program managers and/or members of the CPSP Steering Committee. Agency andHealth Canada studies in 2004 include acute flaccid paralysis, congenital rubella syndrome, adverse drug reactions (serious and life-threatening), early-onset eating disorders, severe combined immunodeficiency and a one-time survey on injuries associated with infant bath seats. The program would not be the success that it is without the support of the paediatricians across Canada who provide the surveillance data by completing detailed reports on each case. I look forward to being informed of new knowledge generated by the surveillance program.Dr. David Butler-Jones 4C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S President of the Canadian Paediatric Society The Canadian Paediatric Society is very proud of the success of the CPSP . From its inception in 1996, the program has become well established and respected within boththe paediatric and public health communities. As an active participant in the CPSP ,I am impressed by its scope and versatility and, above all, by the impact it has had on health practice and policy. As a neonatologist, I have been especially interested in study results that have reinforced the judicious public health decision for a two-dose rubella vaccine regimenthat has resulted in zero to two cases of congenital rubella syndrome per year; and thepolio strategy with no polio-related acute flaccid paralysis reported. Furthermore, asCPS President, I was heartened by findings that reaffirm the importance of CPS recommendations for vitamin D supplementation of all exclusively breast-fed infants in order to prevent nutritional rickets, and adequate assessment and follow-up of early-discharged infants with hyperbilirubinemia in preventing kernicterus. Recognition of the CPSP extends far beyond Canada. This year, the CPSP worked with the International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units, the International Paediatric Association and the Argentinian Paediatric Society. The Public Health Agency of Canada merits special thanks and deserves credit for envisioning the potential of pan-Canadian collaborative epidemiological paediatric surveillance. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues who diligently complete and return the check-off form each month. They deserve a round of applause for contributing to the success of the program.Dr. C. Robin Walker CPSP Chairman Once again, a great year! After a successful program evaluation in 2003, the CPSP entered its ninth year of pan-Canadian surveillance with an all-time high of 13 simultaneous studies. CPSP surveillance data is most meaningful when it invokes action in the form of public health policy and standards of practice. This year, two examples illustrate what I would call 'Surveillance results into action' . Canadian incidence data on injuries associated with baby walkers provided evidence to support Health Canada's legislative ban on baby walkers announced in April 2004. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization revised its statement on varicella vaccine. Data from the CPSP study on necrotizing which reinforced therelation between chickenpox and NF , supported the need for a universal varicella immunization program and demonstrated the severity of infection with children experiencing surgical interventions and prolonged hospitalizations. The CPSP , through its membership in the International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units (INoPSU), fosters international collaboration and cooperation between investigators and encourages simultaneous researchfor the benefit of children who live in the 'global village'. Eight of the 13 current studies and three of the fouraccepted new studies are also being undertaken by at least one other national surveillance unit in INoPSU. Documenting the health status of the paediatric population is an obligation and the CPSP is committed to doing this through surveillance, education and advocacy. I encourage you to read this report to better understand thepertinence of study results to your practice.Dr. Gilles Delage 5C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S CPSP Steering Committee Dr. Gilles Delage (Chair) Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Garth Bruce Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Rick Cooper Paediatric Chairs of Canada Ms. Marie Ad\u00e8le Davis Canadian Paediatric Society Ms. Jo-Anne Doherty Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Public Health Agency of Canada Dr. Danielle Grenier Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Richard Haber Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Susan King Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Simon Levin Canadian Association of Child Neurology Dr. Catherine McCourt Centre for Healthy Human Development, Public Health Agency of Canada Ms. Andrea Medaglia Canadian Paediatric Society Mr. Paul Muirhead Consultant Dr. Jeff Scott Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health Ms. Sarah Srikanthan Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Anne Summers Canadian College of Medical Geneticists Dr. Paul Varughese Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Public Health Agency of Canada Dr. W endy Vaudry IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) Dr. Lynne Warda Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Lonnie Zwaigenbaum Canadian Paediatric Society CPSP Working Group Ms. Andrea Medaglia (Chair) Canadian Paediatric Society Ms. Sarah Srikanthan (Co-Chair) Canadian Paediatric Society Ms. Marie Ad\u00e8le Davis Canadian Paediatric Society Ms. Jo-Anne Doherty Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Public Health Agency of Canada Dr. Danielle Grenier Canadian Paediatric Society A fond farewell to Andrea Medaglia, Senior Coordinator, who retired in December 2004 after nine years of dedicated service.

Dronninglund Castle, January 2004.9C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Surveillance at Work Overview The importance of surveillance to the practice of medicine cannot be overstated. Through the ongoing, systematic collection of data not only can the burden of disease be determined and interventions to prevent the occurrence of a disorder be assessed, but information collected can guide the development of health policy. Surveillance takes data to intelligence into action. The CPSP provides an innovative means to undertake paediatric surveillance and increase awareness of childhood disorders that are high in disability, morbidity, mortality and economic cost to society despite their low frequency. Preference is given to studies that have strong public health importance or could not be undertaken any other way. All studies in the program must conform tohigh standards of scientific rigour and practicality and the CPSP assures the confidentiality of all information provided to the program. The program also offers an opportunity for international collaboration with other paediatric surveillance units worldwide. Process The CPSP Steering Committee oversees the program and reviews new study proposals. Upon initiation of a new study, practising Canadian paediatricians, relevant paediatric subspecialists and other health- care providers receive a summary of the protocol including the case definition and a brief description of the condition. This serves to educate and increase awareness of low-frequency conditions with high morbidity and/or mortality while providing a uniform basis for reporting. The CPSP uses a two- tiered reporting process to ascertain and investigate cases: an initial 'check-off' form and a detailed reporting form. The full process is summarized inFigure 1. Reporting The 'check off' form, listing the conditions currently under surveillance, is mailed monthly to participants. Respondents are asked to indicate, against each condition, the number of new cases seen in the last month, including 'nil' reports. A 'nil' report is very important in active surveillance; the CPSP cannot simply assume that no reply means no cases. Participants report all cases meeting the case definitions, including suspect or probable cases. This sometimes leads to duplicate reports but avoids missed cases. Case ascertainment is monitored and verified by investigating duplicate reports and comparing data with relative programs or centres. Only non-nominal patient information, such as the date of birth, sex of the child and comments on theFIGURE 1 Reporting process summary10C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S 2004 detailed questionnaire completion rates as of March 1, 2005TABLE 1 Studies/conditions Reported cases Pending % Completion rate Acquired demyelinating syndromes of the central nervous system 66 2 97Acute flaccid paralysis 48 0 100 Acute rheumatic fever 47 4 91 Adverse drug reactions - serious and life-threatening 67 4 94CHARGE association/syndrome 16 0 100 Congenital rubella syndrome 8 0 100 Early-onset eating disorders 96 3 97Lap-belt syndrome 20 2 90 Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - severe 96 0 100 Osteogenesis imperfecta 42 4 90Prader-Willi syndrome 38 2 95 Severe combined immunodeficiency 20 1 95 Vitamin D deficiency rickets 44 2 95Total number of cases (all studies) 608 24 96condition, is requested for each reported case. This anonymous information is used to identify duplicates and is entered, as a reminder, on a detailed reporting form, which is sent to the original respondent to request case-specific information. Once the detailed report is returned to the CPSP , it is forwarded to the investigator for analysis. The investigator is responsible for contacting the respondent if further information is required. The CPSP is encouraged by the 96% response rate for completion of detailed questionnaires (see T able 1 for study breakdown). Participants who do not reply every month receive quarterly reminders.As well, information on the monthly compliance rates and the number of cases reported is mailed quarterly to allparticipants to keep them informed of progress.FIGURE 2 Initial response rates (%) and number of participants for 200411C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Participant workload The program evaluation in 2003 indicated that the monthly reporting system is simple with 80% reporting that the follow-up study questionnaireswere easy to complete. As only non-nominal, non- identifiable data are collected through the CPSP , 90% of those who reported a case did not hesitateto provide clinical information. In 2004, even with a total of 608 reported cases, the majority of participants (2,088 of 2,445, 85.4%) had 'nil' cases to report. The importance of zeroreporting must however be re-emphasized. As studies come and go, the workload shifts to different subspecialties. The number of reported cases washigher this year due to the studies on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia-severe and early-onset eating disorders and the inclusion in the program of thestudies on acquired demyelinating syndromes of the central nervous system and adverse drug reactions-serious and life-threatening. Figure 3 illustrates the number of cases reported by respondents in 2004. It shows that most participants (85.4%) had no cases to report and checked off the 'nothing to report' box each month, 9.7% ofparticipants reported one case and 3.9% reported two or three cases. Only 25 participants (1%) completed four or more questionnaires. It isinteresting to note that 102 of the 608 reported cases were duplicates, validating CPSP ascertainment. The CPSP is extremely grateful that the majority of participants faithfully complete the detailed questionnaires subsequent to reporting cases. Thisdemonstrates that they appreciate the enormous value of the scientific data collected and reinforces theinsistence of the Steering Committee on short, precise and pertinent detailed questionnaires. T o thank paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists for their tremendouscommitment to, and support of the CPSP , 1,645 personal certificates were sent to acknowledgeparticipation in 2004, and 340 letters of thankswent to participants who reported a case in 2004.In addition, this year's dinner for two in the early-bird draw was awarded to Dr. Sarah Shea (NS),and the lucky winners of the year-end draws for acomplimentary registration for the June 2005 CPSAnnual Conference in Vancouver were Dr. GeoffreyE. Dougherty (QC), who responded for all monthsin 2004, and Dr. Heide Marie Schroter (AB),who completed and returned questionnaires forreported cases. One-time survey questions The CPSP is also available to survey participants as an inexpensive, one-time only tool to identify the prevalence of a problem or to answer a specific question. Once approved by the CPSP SteeringCommittee, the one-time survey question is sent to all participants with a monthly initial reporting form. Collected results are forwarded to theinvestigator for data analysis. Results of the 2004 one-time survey questions on acquired demyelinating syndromes of the centralnervous system, acute flaccid paralysis, and infantbath seats are found on page 58. FIGURE 3 Number of cases reported by respondents in 200412C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S The CPSP is pleased to see established faculty members mentoring young researchers with their study proposals. As previously noted the CPSP is also available to investigators as a cost-effective tool to survey participants on a one-time basis in order to identifythe prevalence of a problem or to answer a specific question. Format for submissionTABLE 3 Proposals for new studies should include: name of principal author brief abstract of proposal proposed starting date proposed duration question(s) to be addressed by study statement of justification, including how the information could be used case definition expected number of cases availability of ethical approval (state source of approval) funding arrangements identification of projected date for completion of analysis and submission for publicationInvestigators' corner The CPSP provides investigators, through its timely, active surveillance system, an innovative means ofidentifying and obtaining data on low-frequency diseases and conditions from approximately 2,445 participants. The program is committed to a high-caseascertainment rate of over 90% and, due to follow-up reminders to non-responders, boasts a high response rate of 96% on detailed reports (T able 1). The CPSPoffers an opportunity for international collaboration with other paediatric surveillance units worldwide and a chance to make a difference in the health andwell-being of Canadian children and youth. Individual researchers are encouraged to submit proposals for new studies that meet the C riteria considered for inclusion of studies outlined in T able 2 and follow the Format for submission detailed in T able 3. The Steering Committee reviews submissions at its spring and fall meetings, giving preference to studies that have either strong public health importance orcould not be undertaken any other way. Studies must receive ethical approval and have funding in place before final acceptance to the program.Criteria considered for inclusion of studiesTABLE 2 Rarity Disorders of such low incidence or prevalence that national ascertainment of cases is needed (less than 1,000 cases a year). Public health importance Clearly addressing a public or paediatric health issue.Scientific importance Demonstrated scientific interest and importance.Uniqueness Proposal must demonstrate a clear need for data on a condition or disorder for which there is only limited information and for which surveillance is the mostappropriate means of collecting the data. Quality of proposal Proposal must state clear and achievable objectives, practicability, patient confidentiality, adequate resources, clear questionnaire and method ofevaluation. Workload of paediatricians Steering Committee must be convinced that reporting will not make excessive additional demands on the workload of paediatricians. Priority will be given to diseases that are not currently notifiable or, if notifiable, have sufficient indication of under-not ification. Investigators are expected to demonstrate that potential funding is available.13C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S CPSP studies timeline (by end date)TABLE 4 Study Start date End date T otal confirmed cases to December 31, 2004 Group B strep January 1996 December 1996 178 Neural tube defects January 1997 December 1998 107 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease January 1997 June 1999 1 Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn January 1997 December 2000 6 Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis January 1997 December 2000 3 Cerebral edema in diabetic ketoacidosis July 1999 June 2001 23 Progressive intellectual and neurological deterioration July 1999 June 2001 59 Anaphylaxis January 2000 June 2001 732 Hemolytic uremic syndrome April 2000 March 2002 140 Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome January 2000 December 2002 35 Hepatitis C virus infection February 2001 January 2003 58 Neonatal liver failure/perinatal hemochromatosis February 2001 January 2003 10 Necrotizing fasciitis September 2001 August 2003 37 Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection October 2000 September 2003 58 Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - severe July 2002 June 2004 203 Vitamin D deficiency rickets July 2002 June 2004 69 CHARGE association/syndrome September 2001 August 2004 90 Congenital rubella syndrome January 1996 December 2004 9 Prader-Willi syndrome January 2003 December 2004 31 Early-onset eating disorders March 2003 February 2005 63 Lap-belt syndrome September 2003 August 2005 3 Adverse drug reactions - serious and life-threatening January 2004 December 2005 42 Osteogenesis imperfecta January 2004 December 2005 14 Severe combined immunodeficiency April 2004 March 2006 5 Congenital cytomegalovirus infection March 2005 February 2007 N/A Head injury secondary to suspected child maltreatment March 2005 February 2007 N/A (abuse or neglect) Acquired demyelinating syndromes of the central April 2004 March 2007 52 nervous system Acute rheumatic fever April 2004 March 2007 18 Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase September 2005 August 2007 N/A deficiency Acute flaccid paralysis January 1996 December 2007 403 Congenital myotonic dystrophy March 2005 February 2008 N/AStudies timeline14C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S CPSP Principal Investigators Surveillance studies in 2004 Dr. Kim Blake CHARGE association/syndrome Dr. Michael Sgro Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - severeDr. Bruce Carleton Adverse drug reactions - serious and life-threatening Dr. Claude Cyr Lap-belt syndrome New studies in 2005Dr. Paul Varughese and Congenital rubella disorders Dr. Brenda Banwell Acquired demyelinating syndromes of the central nervous system Dr. Christina Templeton Acute rheumatic fever Dr. Leanne Ward Osteogenesis imperfecta and Vitamin D deficiency rickets Dr. Glenn Berall Prader-Willi syndrome Marene Gatali Severe combined immunodeficiency Craig Campbell Congenital myotonic dystrophyMorag Mackay Head injury secondary Chitra Prasad Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency15C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Surveillance Studies in 2004 Acquired demyelinating syndromes of the centralnervous system (April 2004 to March 2007) Highlights Demyelination is not as rare as previously thought as 52 cases were confirmed in the firstnine months of the study. Four confirmed cases have a current diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The majority (80.7%) of confirmed cases required treatment and 96% had brain MRIperformed. Reporting physicians discussed the possibility of recurrent demyelination with patients and families in 86% of first-time cases. Background Acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) of the CNS in childhood are serious events and may not be as rare as previously thought. The varied clinical phenotypes of initial acute CNSdemyelination, termed clinically isolated or associated with encephalopathy (acute disseminatedencephalomyelitis, ADEM). Advancing ourunderstanding of demyelination in children is ofthe utmost importance given that these childrenmay suffer significant acute and long-term morbidity, and are at risk for recurrent demyelination characterizing the chronic autoimmune diseasemultiple sclerosis (MS). This study will gather case-specific data to document the clinical features, epidemiological characteristics,familial autoimmune profile, and the current medical care practices provided to children with ADS. Thisinitiative will provide a measure of the impact of CNS demyelination on Canadian children and aims to enhance care of affected children by increasingawareness among Canadian paediatricians of CNSdemyelination, and of MS in particular, facilitatingprompt and specialized care for children with thisdisease. Objectives 1) T o increase awareness and understanding of paediatric CIS and MS among Canadian paediatricians. 2) T o define the incidence of the various forms of paediatric CIS in Canadian children. 3) T o evaluate the epidemiological features and familial autoimmune profile of children with CIS. 4) T o describe current treatments offered to children with CIS across Canada, with attentionto differences in treatment protocols acrossregions and between community and tertiarycare facilities. 5) T o evaluate paediatric and paediatric neurologist practices in discussing with families thepossibility of MS following CIS in childhood. Case definition Children less than 18 years of age with one of the following syndromes are reported: Acute loss of vision ( optic neuritis ): decreased visual acuity of one or both eyes, typicallymaximal over a period of days, often associated with pain. CT/MRI may show swelling and abnormal signal of optic nerves. Spinal cord dysfunction ( transverse myelitis ): weakness and/or numbness of both legs +/- arms, often associated with bladder retention withmaximal deficits four to 21 days after symptom onset. MRI may demonstrate swelling and/or abnormal signal in the spinal cord.16C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Acute neurological deficits: acute neurological dysfunction (i.e., weakness, numbness/tingling, loss of balance, impaired eye movements, doublevision, poor coordination) maximal within four to 21 days after onset associated with MRI evidence of at least one area of abnormal white mattersignal of the brain or spinal cord. Level ofconsciousness should be normal, and fever orneck stiffness absent. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ( ADEM ): acute neurological deficits (weakness, numbness, loss of balance) associated with at least two of thefollowing: (1) viral prodromal illness within thelast 28 days; (2) fever, (3) stiff neck; (4) headache;(5) altered level of consciousness or behaviour; or(6) seizures. MRI shows multiple areas of abnormal signal in the white matter. Exclusion criteria Demyelination of the peripheral nervous system (i.e., Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, encephalitis, Lyme disease, HIV , HTLV-1, W est Nile virus) Radiation/chemotherapy associated white matter damage. Results Demographic and incidence dataThere were 65 cases of CNS demyelination reported between April 1 and December 31, 2004. Of these reports, 52 cases met inclusion criteria, four cases arepending review, eight were duplicate reports, and one case was discarded (T able 5). The majority of confirmed ADS cases were from Ontario (37/52, 71%). Six other provinces each hadless than five cases (BC, MB, NB, NL, NS and QC). The mean age of confirmed ADS cases is 10.6 years (range 0.6-17.4 years) and the female to male ratio is1.5:1 (31 females, 21 males). Epidemiological and familial autoimmune data Most of the children reported were born in Canada (90%, 47/52), with one child in the United Statesand four children born outside North America.Although the majority of patients reportedethnicity/ancestry as 'White/European' (67%),Asian and mixed-Asian race children were identified (17%). Other ethnic groups identified include Black, Hispanic, Native Canadian and other mixedethnicities. There were three cases in whichancestry/ethnicity was not reported. Fifteen percent (15%, 8/52) of confirmed cases reported a family history of MS, with two unconfirmed reports of family medical history. Innine cases, family history of other autoimmuneconditions was reported, such as thyroiditis, juvenilediabetes mellitus, and systemic lupus. Clinical features and paediatric practices Figure 4 illustrates the various clinical phenotypesseen with the reported cases of acute demyelination.The majority of ADS cases (31%) were ADEM, followed by cases of monosymptomatic CIS optic (19%), and transversemyelitis (15%). T reatment for the demyelinating event was required in all but ten cases. This was reported by indicating whether intravenous or oral steroids were given, or if intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was prescribed.Combinations of the aforementioned medicationswere necessary in half of the patients requiringtreatment (21/42). Acquired demyelinating syndromes of the central nervous system cases April 1 to December 31, 2004TABLE 5 Duplicates 1Excluded 84Under review 52Confirmed Reported 6517C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Fifty (96%) confirmed cases had brain MRIs completed, with 41 of those 50 showing abnormalwhite matter changes. Seven cases reported aninfection preceding the demyelinating event andwithin one month of the demyelinating event, and two of those seven cases received a vaccination within the same period, prior to the event. Eighty-three percent (83%, 43/52) of the confirmed 86% of these first-time cases, recurrentdemyelination was discussed with the patients and families.Conclusion There was an average of approximately six casesreported per month in the first nine months of this study. Based on annual estimates from members of thePaediatric Demyelinating Disease Network (PDDN),it is estimated that 107 children present with acutedemyelination each year in paediatric centres acrossCanada. With the majority of reports coming from Ontario, and with lower than expected numbers of cases reported to the CPSP thus far, theremay be under-reporting or unidentified cases ofdemyelination across the country. The ages of the children reported (ranging from 0.6 to 17.4 years) emphasize the importance of identifying and understanding these events as these children mayexperience significant short and long-term deficits,which can impact their overall development. The majority of these patients required treatment for their demyelinating event and almost all confirmed cases underwent brain MRI. The detailed reportingforms do not include a question about MRI of thespinal cord. MRI of the brain may be normal whileinflammation will be seen in imaging of the spinalcord for patients with transverse myelitis. For these reported cases, there exists a true risk of recurrent demyelination and the possible diagnosisof MS, underscoring the importance of promptdiagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment.From the CPSP reporting, this risk is being discussed with the patients and families showing that reporting physicians are aware of this possibility for childrenpresenting with ADS. A further effort to raiseawareness of these syndromes is needed.

Transient weakness (e.g., post-ictalweakness) should not be reported. Results and discussion In 2004, the CPSP received 48 initial AFP reports that included 35 (73%) confirmed cases, 11 duplicates, and two exclusions (T able 7).Thirty-five confirmed cases represent a rate of0.57 per 100,000, which is below the minimumestimated background rate of one case per 100,000 children less than 15 years of age, or 57 cases. With the anticipated 'late reports' for thecurrent year, the final number is likely to be slightlyhigher but will be well below the W orld HealthOrganization (WHO) targeted rate. There was an equal split in the sex of the cases (18 males and 17 females). The cases ranged in agefrom nine months to 14 years, (median 6.3 years)with a mean four years in 2004. T able 8 shows theage distribution of AFP cases reported in 2004compared with cases reported from 1996 to 2003. Overall, the age distribution is similar throughout the reporting period.Acute flaccid paralysis (January 1996 to December 2007) Highlights No wild polio virus infection has been detected in Canada since 1988. The number of AFP cases reported for 2003 and 2004 was lower than previous years. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome accounts for at least 71% of confirmed AFP cases. Stool investigations for poliovirus are essential. No Campylobacter organisms were detected in stool specimens examined. Background The elimination of indigenous wild poliovirustransmission in Canada, and the rest of the American region, was certified in September 1994. However, until global polio eradication is attained there remainsan ongoing risk of wild poliovirus importation from polio-endemic regions. Consequently, active surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in childrenless than 15 years of age is used to monitor potential cases of paralytic poliomyelitis. Based on an estimated background annual incidence of one AFP case per100,000 in a population less than 15 years of age in the absence of wild poliovirus transmission, the estimated minimum number of AFP cases in Canada is 57 casesper year. AFP surveillance in Canada was initiated in 1991 through the IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program, ACTive) network of paediatrictertiary care centres, and, since 1996, has been implemented through the CPSP . This report presents the results of AFP surveillance in 2004 and comparesthem to those from previous years. Objective The objective of AFP surveillance is to identify AFPcases (including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [GBS]) inchildren less than 15 years of age to rule out paralytic poliomyelitis and thereby monitor the polio-free status of Canada.World Health Organization quality assurance criteria for acute flaccid paralysis surveillanceTABLE 6 1) one case of AFP per 100,000 children under 15 years of age 2) adequate poliovirus stool cultures in at least 80% of AFP cases Acute flaccid paralysis cases in 2004TABLE 7 Duplicates 2Excluded 11 0Under review 35Confirmed Reported 4819C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Although most Canadian children today are vaccinated against polio, only ten of the 35 cases(28.6%) had documentation of routine childhood immunization, and all had received age-appropriate polio immunization. Four cases (11.4%) indicatedthat they had up-to-date immunization for polio, although no polio vaccine-specific information was available on the detailed case report forms. Virological investigation for polio or other enteroviruses A total of 21 (60%) cases had stool examination; virology was not done or the status was unknown for 14 (40%) cases. However, only 15 cases (43%) had adequate stool investigation for the isolation ofpoliovirus or non-polio enteroviruses (i.e., stool specimen collected within two weeks of the onset of paralysis). For six cases, although stool specimenswere collected, it was after two weeks of onset of paralysis. There was no positive identification for polioviruses or other enteroviruses. It is encouragingto note that the proportion of cases who had polio- specific stool investigation has increased from 26% in 1998 to 48% in 2003, with a slight decrease (43%)in 2004 (Figure 5). These rates of adequate stool investigation remain significantly lower than the WHO target of 80%. Eleven throat swabs and18 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were collected for viral isolation. Results for ten throat swabs and 14 CSF specimens were available; nonewere positive for poliovirus. Eighteen (18) of the35 (51%) stool specimens were also tested for Campylobacter organisms, but all were negative. Neurological investigations Neurological investigation consisted of at least one or more of the following: CSF analysis (protein,Age distribution of AFP cases reported to the CPSPTABLE 8 Age group (years) 2 11 9 8 30\u2014 1312 10 35 * Includes two delayed reports not included in the CPSP 2003 Results.Number of cases 2 1518 8 430 - 1 2 - 56 - 10 11 - <15 Total3 18 23 17 612 24 22 13 618 18 14 14 541996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 10 16 11 6 432002 5 17 7 15 442003 * 5 14 97 352004 FIGURE 5 Percentage of AFP cases with adequate polio-specific stool investigations20C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S glucose, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and red blood cells), nerve conduction studies,electromyography, MRI or CT scan. Abnormalfindings compatible with the neurological diagnosis were reported for one or more of the tests done. T wenty-one of the 26 (81%) CSF specimensindicated some abnormal findings. MRI or CT scanning was done for 23 cases (66%); for MRI, 14/23 (61%) showed some abnormality. Electromyographyand/or nerve studies were done for 25 (71%) cases; 23 (92%) of these cases had abnormal findings. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome was the final neurological diagnosis in 25 (71%) cases. These included axonal GBS, GBS/muscular dystrophy, motor variant acute motor axonal myopathy-variant of GBS. T ransverse myelitis was found (14%) and transverse myelitis and acute disseminatedencephalomyelitis (ADEM) was found in two cases (T able 9). The remaining three diagnoses included neuroborreliosis, leukodystrophy and ADEMsecondary to 'cat scratch fever'.Hospitalization was required in 33 of the 35 (94%) cases for periods ranging from one to 37 days (mean of seven days). Of the 35 cases, three (9%) recovered fully, five (14%) had recovered partially with residual weakness, and for six (17%) recovery status was unknown at 60 days after the onset of paralysis. None of the clinical specimens tested, i.e., stool, nasopharyngeal or cerebrospinal fluids, were positive for poliovirus infection. Conclusions The 35 AFP cases identified to date for 2004 arebelow the expected rate in Canada, according to the W orld Health Organization criteria. For the corresponding period for 2003, a total of 44 cases reported were confirmed. It is interesting to note that the AFP reporting rate improved since the introduction of paediatrician- based reporting through the CPSP from 0.5 per 100,000 children less than 15 years in 1996 (30 cases), to 1.04 per 100,000 in 2000 (61 cases);Neurological diagnosis of AFP cases reported to the CPSPTABLE 9 Final diagnosis *Includes four delayed reports not included in the CPSP 2003 Results.Number of 1998 1997 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 * 2004 0 21 6 1 \u2014 1 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014 1 300 34 6 1 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 3 440 29 2 1 1 1 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014 1 350 50 7 \u2014 \u2014\u2014 2 11 \u2014 \u2014 610 49 4 \u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014 8 \u2014 610 42 8 \u2014 \u2014 1 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 3 \u2014 540 33 7 \u2014 \u2014 1 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 2 \u2014 430 33 4 3 \u2014\u2014 1 \u2014\u2014 3 \u2014 440 25 7 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 3 \u2014 3521C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S however, for unknown reasons the rate has decreased since then. Undoubtedly, the expansion of AFP surveillance to the CPSP has improved the completeness of surveillance by ensuring that AFP cases seen at non-tertiary hospitals are reported in addition to those cases admitted to paediatric tertiary care hospitals and reported through IMPACT . The decline in the number of AFP cases documented by the CPSP over the past four years might be due to under-reporting of cases or a reflection of current epidemiological trend; both need to be further investigated. A major area in which the AFP surveillance could be improved is the performance of polio-specific investigations and timely reporting of results. While neurological investigations provide supporting evidence for the final diagnosis in the majority of reported AFP cases, polio-specificlaboratory investigations remain vital for the evaluation of all cases, including those in which poliomyelitis is not being considered as a possible diagnosis. Negative results of appropriate polio- specific investigations are as important as a positive result in AFP case evaluations. The single most important laboratory investigation, recommended by the national W orking Group on Polio Eradication, to confirm or to rule out a diagnosis of paralytic poliomyelitis, is a stool specimen collected within two weeks of onset of paralysis for isolation of wild or vaccine strain poliovirus; specimens may be collected up to six weeks after the onset of paralysis, although after two weeks the sensitivity of virus isolation decreases. The examination of paired serum samples for evidence of a four-fold or greater rise in poliovirus antibody titre in paired sera and/or the presence of poliovirus-specific IgM antibody in a single serological specimen further enhance the evaluation of cases.Principal investigator Paul Varughese, DVM, MSc, Immunization andRespiratory Infections Division, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Public Health Agency of Canada, T unney's Pasture PL and JeannetteMacey in the investigation is greatly appreciated.22C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Acute rheumatic fever (April 2004 to March 2007) Highlights Acute rheumatic fever is extremely rare in paediatrics. Affected children have significant morbidity: eight children with carditis and five with Sydenham's chorea. Multiple medication needs are documented. Background Acute rheumatic fever is a post-infectious collagen vascular disease affecting the heart, joints and central nervous system. It follows untreated Group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis after a latent periodof approximately three weeks. It does not occurafter other GAS infection, such as skin infection(impetigo). W orldwide, it remains the most commoncause of acquired heart disease in children, but the incidence is widely variable from region to region, with the vast majority of cases now occurring indeveloping countries. The incidence of acute rheumatic fever in developed countries has decreased dramatically since its last peak in the 1970s, but it has not disappeared, andremains an important public health issue. Thereason for its decrease is not fully understood. Thedecline in incidence in the early 20 th century had already begun prior to the introduction of effective antimicrobial agents, but common use of penicillin to treat symptomatic sore throat may havecontributed to the decline somewhat (Massell et al,1998). Socio-economic factors, such as overcrowdingand low income, are known to be significant riskfactors (WHO, 1998). The majority of cases of rheumatic fever follow cases of pharyngitis due to specific M serotypes of GAS, most commonly 1, 3,5, 6, 18, 19 and 24 and spontaneous fluctuation ofthe prevalence of these serotypes is known to occur(Schwartz et al, 1990, Colman et al, 1993).Rheumatic fever is not a reportable condition in Canada, and in the current era of evidence-based,judicious use of antibiotics, ongoing surveillanceof this now rare but serious condition is crucial. Rheumatic heart disease is a lifelong complication of the condition, which can lead to ongoingmedical and surgical needs and can interfere withemployment, causing significant socio-economicimpact. However, the risk of developing rheumaticfever must be balanced against the risk of encouraging microbial antibiotic resistance, which is a growing problem in all developed nations andcarries its own impact. There is no current Canadian literature to suggest incidence. This is a sufficiently rare condition that only a national reporting system could gather statistically significant numbers. Objectives 1) T o determine the incidence of rheumatic fever among Canadian children. 2) T o determine the relationship between modern rheumatic fever and demographic features, suchas overcrowding and low household income. 3) T o describe current Canadian treatment practices. 4) T o determine the morbidity and mortality of first episode rheumatic fever in Canada. Case definition Report any child up to and including 18 years of age that meets the most recent modification of the Jones criteria for diagnosis of an initial attack of rheumatic fever (T able 10). The definition of carditis requires clinical evidence of cardiac involvement in the form of a pathologicalmurmur, pericarditis, or congestive heart failure. Current literature is divided as to whether silent echocardiographic findings should be included(Ozkutlu, 2001); the questionnaire includes thisinformation, but the case definition remains faithfulto current international consensus requiring clinicalmanifestations.23C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Results Demographic data Of the 18 cases confirmed to date, six were in Ontario, five in Quebec and less than five cases in five other provinces (BC, MB, NL, NS and SK). The average age at diagnosis was 10.6 years. There were 12 girls and six boys. Of those cases in whom numbers of individuals in the household were reported, the average total occupancy of theGuidelines for the diagnosis of an initial attack of rheumatic fever, Jones criteriaTABLE 10 Major manifestations CarditisPolyarthritis ChoreaErythema marginatum Subcutaneous nodulesMinor manifestations Clinical Arthralgia Increased acute phase reactants:- Increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Increased C-reactive protein Prolonged P-R interval All cases, except Sydenham's chorea, will require documentation of antecedent group A streptococcal infection, either by positive throat culture, rapid antigen test, or an elevated or rising antibody titre. Antistreptolysin O titre measurement is the preferred test to distinguish recent streptococcal infection from chronic pharyngeal carriage. If there is evidence of recent streptococcal infection, the presence of two major manifestations or one major and two minor manifestations will be considered diagnostic. Acute rheumatic fever cases April 1 to December 31, 2004TABLE 11 Duplicates 6Excluded 11 10Under review 18Confirmed Reported 45household was 5.2, with the average number under the age of 18 being 2.8. However, reporting paediatricians were able to supply this information in just over half of the cases. All children except two were born in Canada, and one visited a developing country just prior to diagnosis. Systems affected Eight patients had carditis meeting clinical criteria, with four of them requiring medical therapy forcongestive heart failure at the time of reporting. Therapy consisted of digoxin, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and diuretics. None required surgicaltherapy. T welve patients had polyarthritis meeting clinical criteria; it was migratory in ten of those cases. All were receiving anti-inflammatorymedication at the time of reporting. Medications being used included naproxen, prednisone, aspirin, and ibuprofen. Five patients had Sydenham's chorea;three reports included documentation of medical therapy. Agents used were risperidone, valproic acid, and clonazepam. T wo patients had erythemamarginatum, and two patients had subcutaneous nodules. Long-term prophylaxis In two cases, follow-up data on antibiotic prophylaxis delivery was unavailable. In the remaining 16 cases, all are receiving prophylaxis. T wo are receiving monthly IM injections of benzathine penicillin.T wo are receiving erythromycin because of penicillin allergy. The remaining 12 patients are all receiving oral penicillin twice daily. Conclusion The first year of this study has shown, as expected, that acute rheumatic fever in children 18 years and younger is an extremely rare condition, with only 18 confirmed cases documented nationally. Within this small group, there is significant morbidity and a requirement for multiple medications. There is a continuing need for vigilance so that ARF is prevented whenever possible.24C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S It is hoped that ultimately this study will provide valuable data on the incidence of rheumatic fever that can be taken into consideration in guidelines for treatment of pharyngitis, keeping the relevant risks balanced.

Human, BM, Department of Paediatrics, University of British Columbia Proton Rahman, MD, Memorial University of NewfoundlandAdverse drug reactions - seriousand life-threatening (January 2004 to December 2005) Highlights The majority of suspected ADRs were previously recognized reactions. The drugs most frequently reported in suspected ADRs were carbamazepine,valproic acid, amoxicillin, and cefprozil. Because the majority of drugs are not tested in the paediatric population, post-marketingsurveillance of ADRs is essential to identify reactions not recognized prior to drug licensure. Background Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been estimated to rank as one of the top ten leading causes of death and illness in the developed world.Children may be at greater risk of ADRs than adults. Alarmingly, between 13.7% and 16.6% of paediatric hospitalizations are a result of ADRs, and27.9% of these reactions are severe. There is a remarkable lack of understanding of causation, and therefore limited ability to avoid or prevent theseoccurrences. Health Canada, through the Canadian Adverse Reaction Monitoring Program, received 1,209 reports of suspected ADRs in children between January 1, 1998 and May 30, 2002. However, thisvoluntary reporting system reflects only a small proportion of significant ADRs. Health-related accreditation bodies estimate that 95% of allADRs in Canada are not reported. Systematic examination of medical outcomes is clearly25C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S impossible if only 5% of the actual reactions are reported. More than 75% of prescribed pharmaceuticals on the market in North America have never been tested in paediatric populations and are used without adequate guidelines for safety or efficacy. Clinical practice focused on adjusting dosage to account for smaller body mass, with the assumption that clinical effects would be equivalent to those observed in adults. It is for these reasons that children worldwide are described as \"therapeutic orphans\" and are placed at an increased risk of therapeutic failure, while ADRs continue to cause unnecessary disability and death. It is now understood that a host of biological, developmental and behavioural factors impact the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceuticals when used in paediatric patients. As a result, newborns,infants and children who require medication for acute, chronic and life-threatening diseases are at risk of a range of ADRs from lack of efficacy andminor ADRs through to severe morbidity and death. Objectives 1) Increase reporting by paediatricians (CPSP) of serious and life-threatening adverse drugreactions that occur in children aged 18 years or less, not currently captured by existing spontaneous reporting systems. 2) Determine the usefulness of the data collected by CPSP for meaningful analysis and interpretation. 3) Identify public health concerns regarding adverse drug reactions in the paediatric population. Case definition Serious and life-threatening adverse drug reactions* in an infant or child 18 years or less, associated with the use of prescription, non- prescription, biological (immunoglobulin) products, complementary medicine (including herbals), and radio-pharmaceutical products. Report even if youare not certain if the product caused the adverse reaction or you do not have all the reporting details. Exclusions: Do not report reactions due to medical devices, blood products (platelets, red cells, single donor plasma), vaccines, poisonings or self- administered overdoses. *Noxious and unintended severe response to a drug which occurs at any dose and results in emergency observation, hospitalization, persistent or significant disability, or death. Results During 2004, 64 reports of suspected ADRs were submitted to the CPSP . For these, 53 detailed reports were received. Eleven of the detailed reports were excluded due to lack of information or failure to meet the inclusion criteria. In total we examined 42 reports of paediatric suspected adverse drug reactions in our analysis (T able 12). Fourteen reports concerned females, 25 concerned males, and in three cases the gender was not mentioned. The majority of reported cases involved patients between six and 18 years of age. The patient's age was not reported in one case included in the analysis, but it was judged that the drug had been administered to a child. The majority of patients (78%) were Caucasian, one child was Bangladeshi, one Kurdish and one a native Canadian. In six reports no race was reported. Drugs responsible for suspected adverse drug reactions In 36 cases, just one active ingredient was suspected of causing the reaction; in six cases two suspected Adverse drug reactions - serious and life-threatening cases in 2004TABLE 12 Duplicates 11Excluded 01 1Under review 42Confirmed Reported 6426C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Patient outcomes resulting from reported suspected ADRsEighty-one percent (81%) (n=34) of the reportsof suspected adverse drug reactions providedinformation about patient outcome (T able 14). Of note is that more than one outcome was reported for most cases. There were no deaths associated withany of the reported cases. At the time of reporting, the recovery status of patients was: 20 recovered, five not recovered and 17 unknown or not reported. In 26 cases it was reported that the reaction abated after the drug wasstopped or dose reduced. There were six reportedcases of drug re-challenge; in four cases the drugreaction reappeared and in two cases it did not.There were no reports of other family members having a similar reaction to the drug suspected of causing the ADR. Discussion The majority of suspected ADRs were previouslyrecognized reactions that had been published in themedical literature and associated with the specificdrug or drug class. The two most frequently reported drug classes involved were anticonvulsant and antibiotic. No death was reported but ten life-threatening events were reported and one childremains disabled. Thorough analysis of the data willgeneric drugs were involved. Involvement of 35 unique active ingredients was reported. The suspected drugs most frequently reported were: carbamazepine, valproic acid, amoxicillin,and cefprozil (T able 13). Examples of reported reactions suspected to be associated with valproic acid included necrotizing pancreatitis,thrombocytopenia and (neutropenia, from suspected ADRTABLE 14 Outcome Life-threatening reaction HospitalizationHospitalization prolonged due to ADR Disability Required intervention to prevent damage/ permanent impairment Died Unknown TotalTimes reported * 10 20 12 1 15 0 8 66 * Possibility of overlapSuspected active ingredients (n=35) in ADR reports (n=48)TABLE 4 1 1 1 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 * Erythromycin ethylsuccinate27C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S be undertaken over the next year to establish the usefulness of the data collected by the CPSP formeaningful analysis and interpretation, includingthe level to which the CPSP identified serious life- threatening ADRs not captured by the existing spontaneous reporting system. Conclusion In many cases, information collected was incomplete. T o adequately assess causality, it is critical that clinicians be vigilant at answering all questions: drug name, dose, strength, dosage form, route ofadministration, therapy dates, date of suspected ADR, concomitant drugs and re-challenge information. Without full collection of these data,causal relationships between drug and reaction cannot be demonstrated. In general, the need for increased reporting and the lack of complete information about the reactionsexperienced make drawing definitive conclusionsabout causality or patient safety impossible. Because the majority of drugs are not tested in the paediatric population, post-marketing surveillance of adversedrug reactions is essential in helping to identifypossible adverse reactions not recognized prior todrug licensure.

Refinement of the diagnostic clinical criteria based on study results is proposed. Behavioural issues, osteopenia/osteoporosis and pubertal delay are common in adolescents and adults with CHARGE. Background CHARGE association/syndrome (CHARGE A/S) is a constellation of a number of congenital anomaliesthat was first given the acronym CHARGE( Coloboma, Heart Defect, Choanal Atresia, Retarded Growth and Development, Genital Hypoplasia, Ear Anomalies/Deafness) in 1981. Over the past 15 years, the specificity of this pattern of malformations has reached the level thatmany clinicians now consider it to be a discreterecognizable syndrome (Graham JM, Am J Med Genet 2001; 99:120-3). The clinical criteria originallyproposed needed further refinement. The revised consensus clinical diagnostic criteria by Blake et al, 1998, incorporated both major and minor featuresfor CHARGE A/S and have been documented toenhance clinical diagnosis and facilitate researchefforts. These clinical criteria consist of four majorcharacteristics: coloboma, choanal atresia, characteristic ear anomalies, cranial nerve dysfunction (facial palsy, vestibular dysfunction, andswallowing difficulties) and seven minor features:heart defect, orofacial cleft, genital hypoplasia,growth deficiency, developmental delay,tracheoesophageal fistula and a distinctive facial appearance. The diagnosis is firmly established when all four major or three major and three minor clinical28C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S criteria are present. Some of the clinical features are difficult to detect in infants, and as the major characteristics are rare in other conditions, the CHARGE A/S diagnosis needs to be considered inany individual who has one or two major clinicalcriteria and several minor characteristics. T o defineCHARGE A/S in these individuals, a cranial CT orMRI scan may show hypoplasia of the semicircular canals and/or cochlea and/or choanal atresia or stenosis. High resolution chromosome studies,fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 22q11 deletion and the subtelomeric deletion FISH testinghelp to rule out any chromosomal abnormalitiesaccounting for the multiple congenital anomalies. An increase in paternal age of CHARGE A/S children has been recognized as a risk factor andneeds to be confirmed. Recently, mutations in a newmember of the chromodomain gene family (CHD7)on chromosome 8 were identified in CHARGEindividuals, confirming a genetic etiology (Vissers LE et al, Natl Genet 2004; 36:955-7). The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and prevalence of CHARGE A/S inCanada, as the true incidence is unknown. AsCHARGE A/S presents with a wide spectrum of clinical severity, mildly affected patients may also be diagnosed and can be followed prospectively. Thereview article entitled, \"CHARGE association: Anupdate and review Clin Pediatr 1998; 37:159-74) summarizes current understanding of the management of this complex and chronic multiple congenital anomaly, giving physicians a guide to the management ofCHARGE A/S. Objectives 1) T o determine the incidence and prevalence of CHARGE A/S in Canada by ascertaining allidentified cases of CHARGE A/S (old and new). 2) T o obtain demographic and medical information on patients with CHARGE A/S and assemble adatabase to answer research questions. 3) T o follow, developmentally and behaviourally, an identified group of CHARGE A/S infants whohave been diagnosed at an early age and have obtained early intervention services. Will earlyrecognition and treatment of these infants improve their clinical and behavioural well- being? 4) T o answer future research questions. Case definitions Infant/child/adult with four major clinical criteria or three major and three minor clinical criteria. Major inclusion clinical criteria: coloboma, choanal atresia, characteristic ear abnormalities, cranial nerve dysfunction. Minor inclusion clinical criteria: genital hypoplasia, developmental delay, cardiovascular malformations, growth deficiencies, orofacialcleft, tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula, characteristic face. Exclusion criteria V elocardiofacial syndrome and DiGeorge Sequenceshould be excluded using FISH test (fluorescent in situ hybridization) to exclude 22q11 deletion. Results Incidence In three years of surveillance, 100 individuals with confirmed CHARGE A/S, 55 males and 45 females,were reported. T able 15 not only provides data on case reports, but also demonstrates the high rate of duplicates. The provincial distribution of confirmedcases reported during the study period is summarized in T able 16 and continues to demonstrate a provincial variation. Interestingly, no cases were reported fromthe territories. Figure 6 demonstrates that a higher proportion of CHARGE (A/S) individuals were identified in the CHARGE association/syndrome cases September 1, 2001 to August 31, 2004TABLE 15 Duplicates 32Excluded 55 3Under review 100Confirmed Reported 19029C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S younger population. Close to 60% of individuals were under six years while less than 20% were12 years or older. Characteristics of the study population As demonstrated in T able 17, the frequency of themajor and minor features of CHARGE A/S in this study resembled previously published data (Blake et al, 1998; T ellier AL, Report of 47 cases and review,Am J Med Genet 1998; 76[9],402-9), with the exception of the characteristic facial features.Interestingly, anomalies that were previouslyconsidered to be occasionally or rarely associated with CHARGE A/S were reported with relatively high frequency in this study population. Renalanomalies were noted in close to 40% of individuals.Neck and shoulder anomalies, including a short orwebbed neck or sloping shoulders, were noted in32% of cases. These occasional anomalies might have been considered infrequent findings among individuals with CHARGE A/S because prior studiesof CHARGE A/S patients did not specificallyascertain their presence. Adolescents and adults There were only 19 cases of adolescents and adults with CHARGE A/S identified through thesurveillance. Sixteen cases with complete data are presented in T able 18. Many of these individuals demonstrated the more severe phenotype of CHARGE syndrome. Bilateral posterior choanalatresia, considered one of the more classicalfeatures of CHARGE A/S, was present in 7/16 cases(44%), while six individuals had all four majorcharacteristics. Severe feeding problems (14/16) were also common in this older population. Gastroesophageal reflux was reported in 62% (10/16)of individuals and was severe enough to requireplacement of a gastrostomy tube in 50% (5/10). Behavioural difficulties, including obsessive- compulsive behaviour, hyperactivity and sleep disturbances were reported in 75% (12/16). Pubertaldelay was diagnosed in 67% (8/12) of those who had been assessed. Paternal age The mean paternal age at the time of birth ofindividuals with CHARGE syndrome was 31.5 \u00b15.1(SD) years (n=54).

Conclusions This surveillance study confirmed 100 CHARGE A/S cases and demonstrated the range of clinical presentation in the Canadian population. It alsorepresents the largest epidemiological cohort in theliterature. Certain features, such as neck anomalies,previously thought to be occasionally associatedwith CHARGE A/S, appear to be relatively common findings. There continues to be provincial variation in confirmed cases suggesting under-reporting incertain regions. The surveillance identified relatively few adults and adolescents with CHARGE A/S. For a number of these individuals complete data is not yet available. Older individuals with CHARGE A/S face uniquechallenges, specifically behavioural issues andpubertal delay. In addition, preliminary resultsof a study on the prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia in adolescents and adults with CHARGE A/S suggest a high frequency of osteopenia in thispopulation. Hypogonadism and a decreased level ofphysical activity relative to controls appear to becontributing factors. There was a trend toward increased paternal age with increased severity of clinical presentation. However,there was no significant difference in the meanpaternal age of the entire study population. Based on the results of this study, a refinement of the diagnostic clinical criteria was recently proposed (Issekutz KA et al, Am J Med Genet 2005; 133A: 309-17) to capture the clinical issues that appearas the child develops, including feeding difficulties,vestibular problems and pubertal delay. This mayhelp to identify older children with CHARGE syndrome. Consistent use of temporal bone imagingwas also recommended as a means to confirm the diagnosis of CHARGE A/S. The discovery of apossible genetic etiology for CHARGE syndromeshould facilitate making the diagnosis in the future. There is much interest in understanding behaviour in individuals with CHARGE A/S. This is an areathat will be explored further. A resent study (SmithIM et al, Am J Med Genet 2005) gives preliminary results of a cohort of individuals identified through the CPSP surveillance.

During a national consensus conference in 1994, a goal of eliminatingindigenous rubella infection during pregnancy by the year 2000 was established. In November 2001, a National Expert W orking Group on Rubellarecommended that all rubella infections be included in enhanced surveillance, like that of measles. In 2003, the 44 th Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization set a goal to eliminate rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in the Americas (including Canada) by theyear 2010. A national consensus meeting will be held in June 2005 to set specific Canadian immunization goals and objectives for six vaccine preventablediseases (rubella/CRS included) under the National Immunization Strategy. In Canada, passive reporting of CRS to the Notifiable Diseases Reporting System (NDRS) began in 1979. Active surveillance of CRS began in 1992through a network of tertiary care paediatric hospitals (now representing more than 90% of paediatric tertiary care beds in Canada) participatingin IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program, ACTive) and in 1996 through the CPSP . Objectives 1) T o estimate the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome. 2) T o obtain detailed epidemiological data, including maternal histories, on reported cases of congenital rubella syndrome and infection. Case definitions Confirmed case Live birth T wo clinically compatible manifestations (any combination from T able 19, columns A and B) with laboratory confirmation of infection: isolation of rubella virus from an appropriate clinical specimen; or detection of rubella-specific IgM in the absence of recent immunization with rubella-containingvaccine; orCongenital rubella syndrome (January 1996 to December 2004) Final Report Highlights There was one newborn with CRS reported in 2004 illustrating a missed preventionopportunity. From 1996 to 2004, nine of the ten cases were reported to the CPSP , which reinforced routine reporting through Notifiable DiseasesReporting System. Canada continues to experience very low incidence of rubella and CRS (0 to 0.6 per100,000 live births), a reflection of the impact of rubella elimination strategies and the importance of all children receiving theirrecommended vaccinations. Special attention should be given to immigrant women of child-bearing age. T o prevent missed opportunities, standing orders for vaccination of all rubella-susceptible women in the immediate postpartum periodare essential. Background In Canada, rubella immunization programs were introduced in the 1970s. However, the programstrategies varied; some provinces initially opted forselective immunization of pre-adolescent femalesand others opted for immunization of all infants.By 1983, all provinces and territories across Canada had implemented routine measles-mumps-rubella combined vaccine (MMR) at 12 months. During1996 and 1997, all provinces and territoriesintroduced a routine second dose of MMR ormeasles-rubella combined vaccine (MR) given at18 months or four to six years. Some jurisdictions used MR vaccine for their second dose catch-up campaigns. Since 1970 the incidence of rubella in Canada has declined markedly; fewer than 15 cases were reported33C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S rubella-specific IgG persisting at elevated levels for longer than would be expected from passive transfer of maternal antibody, or in the absence of recent immunization. Stillbirth T wo clinically compatible manifestations withisolation of rubella virus from an appropriate clinicalspecimen. Note: The following cannot be classified as a CRS case: rubella antibody titre absent in the infant; or rubella titre absent in the mother; or rubella antibody titre declining in the infant consistent with the normal decline after birth of passively transferred maternal antibody. Congenital rubella infection Confirmed case A case with laboratory confirmation of infectionbut with no clinically compatible manifestations: isolation of rubella virus from an appropriate clinical specimen; or detection of rubella-specific IgM in the absence of recent immunization with rubella-containing vaccine; or persistence of rubella-specific IgG at elevated levels for longer than would be expected frompassive transfer of maternal antibody, or in theabsence of recent immunization. Rubella in clinical illness Confirmed case Laboratory confirmation of infection in the absence of recent immunization with rubella containingvaccine: isolation of rubella virus from an appropriate clinical specimen; or significant rise in serum rubella IgG antibody levels by any standard serological assay; or positive serologic test for rubella-specific IgM; or clinical illness * in a person who is epidemiologically linked to a laboratory confirmed case. * Clinical illness is characterized by fever and rash, and at least one of the following: arthralgia/arthritis, lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis. Up to 50% of rubella infections reported to be subclinical.Congenital rubella syndrome: Clinically compatible manifestationsTABLE 19 Column A Microphthalmia5. Mental retardation6.

Pigmentary retinopathy Results and discussion In 2004, there were eight CRS reports: only one case has been confirmed, three reports were duplicates,three were excluded and one report is missingdetailed information (T able 20). The one confirmed case was a premature newborn female, with intrauterine growth retardation,congenital cataract, microphthalmia, patent ductusarteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, microcephaly, andjaundice. Rubella virus was isolated from the infant's urine collected on the day of birth, and the serum was positive for rubella specific IgM. The mother was a G:IV , P:I, A:II, born in South East Asia who immigrated to Canada in the early 1990s.All her pregnancies occurred in Canada: one healthy child, one miscarriage and one interrupted pregnancy. During the most recent pregnancy, themother visited her home country during the firsttrimester but does not recall having any symptoms Congenital rubella syndrome cases in 2004TABLE 20 Duplicates 3Excluded 31Under review 1Confirmed Reported 834C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Conclusions and recommendations The very low incidence of CRS and rubella disease suggest that Canada is getting closer to achieving the goal of eliminating indigenous rubella infection during pregnancy. This is in line with the PanAmerican goal of rubella elimination by 2010. Based on the current incidence pattern, and assuming that the majority of symptomatic rubella cases aredetected and reported, it is likely that there is no indigenous transmission of rubella virus in Canada. More epidemiological and virological investigations,including molecular characterizations of rubella virus isolates from Canadian cases, are needed to confirm the status of indigenous virus elimination. Unlikemeasles, rubella cases could easily be missed because of a lack of clinical specificity and relatively low clinical severity. Whenever possible, clinicalspecimens should be collected for rubella virus isolation and molecular characterization. The continuing occurrence of CRS involving immigrantmothers, although low, serves as a reminder of the ongoing need to pay special attention to the immunization of this group in order to make surethat CRS prevention opportunities are not missed. Health-care providers are requested to ensure that: All patients receive their rubella vaccinations at the recommended age. All women of child-bearing age without documented proof of rubella immunization receive the vaccine. Special attention should be given to women from regions with poor vaccinationcoverage, including women in immigrant populations. All women of child-bearing age have routine rubella antibody screening antenatally by a reliable method. If found to be susceptible, they should be vaccinated in the immediate postpartum period. Standing orders for vaccination of rubella- susceptible women before discharge from hospital is the most effective way to ensure that the opportunity is not missed. This is key to the congenital rubella prevention strategy.Cases of CRS by year of birth reported to CPSP/IMPACT and NDRS from January 1996 to December 2004TABLE 21 Year of birth 1 00 0 00 0 00 1 * Notifiable Diseases Reporting System data is provisional.Reported to 19971998 1999 20002001 2002* 0 00 0 10 0 1Reported to CPSP only 1 11 1 20 1 01 8Reported to both NDRS * and CPSP 2 11 1 20 2 01 10Total of rubella infection or having any contact with rubella cases. She was reported to have received rubella-containing vaccine nine years ago, according to her family physician, but documentationis not available as to exactly when and where shereceived the vaccine. Routine rubella IgG testingbefore the current pregnancy was not carried out.However, after the current delivery of the CRS infant, stored blood from the mother collected during pregnancy, when tested, revealed thepresence of rubella-specific IgM. During nine years (from January 1996 to December 2004) of active surveillance, ten CRS cases were reported and confirmed in Canada (T able 21). Of the eight cases whose status was recorded, five were bornto immigrant women, one to an aboriginal woman,and two to non-aboriginal Canadian-born women.These cases illustrate the need for: a) documentedrubella vaccination, b) innovative ways to reach the sub-population of susceptible immigrant women, c) documentation of maternal immunity statusby a reliable method, and d) routine practice ofpostpartum rubella vaccine when indicated.35C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S The recommended 'cold chain' is respected during transportation and storage to avoid vaccinedamage and loss of potency. Future surveillance Even though CRS monitoring through the CPSPended in December 2004, awareness of rubella/CRS among paediatricians and health-care professionals looking after pregnant women must be maintained,and continued surveillance is vital. T o this end, enhanced surveillance will continue through other existing surveillance systems: the IMPACT , andprovincial and territorial ministries. In addition, it is anticipated that the national enhanced surveillance for measles will be extended to include all rubella/CRS cases, to better understand current epidemiology of the disease, including the role of importation and import-linked cases, chains oftransmission, and to formulate appropriate public health strategies to comply with the national and international goals. Principal investigator Paul Varughese, DVM, MSc, Immunization and Respiratory Infections Division, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, PublicHealth Agency of Canada, T unney's Pasture, are extremely grateful to all participatingpaediatricians, especially those who have alertedabout a potential case and completed the detailed case investigation form. Ongoing support of the Canadian Paediatric Society is very muchappreciated.Early-onset eating disorders (March 2003 to February 2005) Highlights Ninety-seven percent (97%) of cases were identified in children over eight years of age. Food avoidance was the predominant clinical feature. Almost half (44%) required an inpatient admission for treatment. Background Epidemiological studies suggest that over the last 50 years the prevalence of anorexia nervosa in young adolescents has been increasing, and it is alsosuggested that the age of onset of eating disorders isbecoming younger. However, there is ongoing debatein the literature about how to apply the currentdiagnostic criteria for eating disorders to childrenand younger adolescents. What is known is that significant medical and psychological complications arise from starvation, weight loss or lack ofappropriate weight gain during childhood andadolescence making this group of conditionsimportant to recognize and treat appropriately. This study will document the incidence of early- onset eating disorders (EOED) in Canadian childrenand provide descriptive data on the abnormal cognitions, behaviours and severity of weight loss or growth failure as a consequence. This otherwiseunavailable data will aid in resource allocation and ultimately allow for better understanding and recognition of this condition in younger childrenwhere currently the diagnosis may be delayed or missed. Objectives 1) T o determine the minimum estimated incidence of early-onset eating disorders in children andyoung adolescents aged five to 12 years inCanada.36C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Proportion of children with various symptoms (n=72)TABLE 24 Symptom Food avoidanceExcessive exercise Self-induced vomiting Fear of weight gain or fat Perception that body is larger Preoccupation with weight Preoccupation with food Laxative use Diuretic useSomatic complaints Denial of severity of symptoms Smoking Weight LossYes 70 (97.2%)38 (52.8%) 9 (12.5%) 51 (70.8%) 24 (33.3%) 48 (66.7%) 1 (1.4%) 56 (77.8%)No Unknown 1 33 57 16 25 22 11 71 7146 19 70 151 1 6 5 8 3 1 1 1 2 5 1 12) T o describe the range of medical and psychiatric clinical features at presentation. 3) T o compare the clinical features in children and young adolescents with existing diagnostic criteria for eating disorders in older patients. 4) T o describe current therapeutic interventions used in management. Case definition Any child from five to 12 years of age inclusively,seen in the previous month, with newly diagnosed early-onset eating disorder, where eating disorder is defined as: determined food avoidance and weight loss or failure to gain weight during a period of expected growth, not due to any identifiable organic cause such as celiac disease. Exclusion criteria Obese children in a supervised weight management program Results Estimated incidence is 2.22/100,000 Male to female ratio is 1:13 (5 boys and 67 girls) Mean weight loss is 8.5 kg (\u00b15.6) For the diagnosis of an eating disorder in young children between the ages of five and 12 years, the female to male ratio averaged out over the two years to 8:1 (5:1 in year one and 13:1 in year two), ascompared to 10:1 in the older adolescent and adult population. Boys are more likely to be affected in the younger age group. The majority of childrenidentified were Caucasian, although Asian and Latin American children were also identified. The group's mean weight loss was 7.8 kg (\u00b15.4) (6.8 kg [\u00b14.7] inyear one and 8.5 kg [\u00b15.68] in year two). This is a substantial weight loss considering that this age group should be gaining weight during these years.The greatest weight loss was found in older children 11 to 12 years of age: girls in this age group lost an average of 9 kg (+6 kg) with a range of 1.4 kg toEarly-onset eating disorders cases in 2004TABLE 22 Duplicates 3Excluded 13 5Under review 72Confirmed Reported 93 EthnicityTABLE 23 Caucasian 2 (3%)Latin American 65 (92%) 1 (1%)Middle Eastern 1 (1%)Unknown Asian 3 (4%) Frequency 28 kg.

This was approximately 21% of their total body weight. Of note is that four of the 63 children(6.5%) for whom data was available failed to gain weight. Almost half (44%) required an inpatient admission for treatment.37C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Diagnosis Depression Obsessive/compulsive disorder Anxiety Other Psychopharmacologic medication used Family psychiatric history Change in social situationYes 12 (16.7%) 7 (9.7%) 17 (23.6%) 7 (9.7%) 12 (16.7%) 32 (44.4%) 39 (54.2%)57 62 50 65 51 40 303 3 5 0 9 0 3 Physical effects of disorder (n=72)TABLE 26 Physical symptom Hypothermia Hypotension Bradycardia Average beats/minute Admitted to hospital Nasogastric tube usedPatient aliveYes No Unknown 55 53 45 39 52 05 1 1 1 13 012 (16.7%)18 (25.0%) 26 (36.1%) 35 beats/min 32 (44.4%) (n=72)TABLE 27 Providers Paediatrician PsychiatristDietitian Psychologist Social workerNurse Family therapist Family physicianYes No Unknown 0 26 1222 22 6965 710 9 39 8 00 (1.4%) Number of children with weight loss by age and sexTABLE 28 Sex boys girls5-8 years old 9-10 years psychiatrists are identifying children and younger adolescents with eating disorders. Ninety-seven percent (97%) of cases wereidentified in children over the age of eight years old. In that group, 80% of the boys (4/5), but only 70% (45/64) of the girls, had lost weight as part of theirsymptomatology. Averaged out over the two years, 93% of the boys had lost weight while only 75% of the girls were listed as having lost weight. This mayindicate that for boys to be identified as having eating problems they have to lose weight, while with girls the eating behaviour may be enough to garnerattention. Eating disorders are more common in girls and the community may not be looking for it in boys. Food avoidance was the predominant clinical feature in all confirmed cases. Many children also displayeda preoccupation with food and weight and a fear ofgaining weight. However, like the older adolescent, over half of these children denied their symptoms. Both years of the study identified similar clinicalfindings. Finally, one of the criteria for diagnosing anorexia nervosa in females is amenorrhea. Children less than 12 years old would not necessarily be at an age where menarche would have occurred and therefore thecriteria of amenorrhea (loss of three consecutivemenstrual periods) may not be useful criteria forthe diagnosis of anorexia nervosa in children andyounger adolescents. Consequently, the majority of the children did not meet the full criteria for anorexia nervosa as outlined in the DSM-IV . Thisdata suggests that it may be difficult to apply thecurrent DSM-IV criteria to children and youngeradolescents. There may also be problems in matchingclinical populations to the existing classification systems that are based on adults with eating disorders. Developmentally, children have limitedability for insight that would be required to endorsethe full spectrum of symptoms. Furthermore, children and younger adolescents may present with types of clinical eating disturbancesCo-morbid psychiatric diagnosis (n=72)TABLE 25 No Unknown38C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S that are different from the classic eating disorders of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa with respect to core psychopathology. Nonetheless, the presenting symptoms are as medically and psychologicallyproblematic. As seen in the first year of study, some children continued to endorse the symptoms of vomiting (12.5%) and fear of gaining weight (70%). Thesefindings have traditionally been thought to occur in older adolescents and therefore this finding requires further investigation. The majority of children did not have a history of a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis. However, 44% of this population had positive psychiatric family history.This finding was higher in year two of the study.Fifty-four percent (54%) had changes in their socialsituation. Bradycardia was more common in year two at 36% as opposed to 26% and remained the most commonmedical complication identified. Forty-four percent(44%) of the children were admitted to hospital. This study is based on a similar data collection undertaken by the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit (APSU). After 21 months of surveillance,45 cases of EOED in Australian children aged fiveto 13 years (inclusively) have been confirmed. Of thereported cases, 71% are female and 16% are youngerthan 11 years of age. A decrease in weight in the six months prior to diagnosis was observed in 89% of cases, with a median weight loss of 6 kg. The profile of clinical features for these identified cases at the time of diagnosis is consistent with thosebeing reported in Canada. However, abnormal medical findings are being reported in a higher proportion of Australian children with temperatureless than 35.5 o C reported in 40%, and bradycardia (minimum 36 beats/minute) reported in 53% of children. Concurrent depression is also being reportedin a higher proportion of Australian children (40%).Some international variation in management practices may be emerging, with 60% of the Australian sample receiving nasogastric (NG) feeding. This may be a consequence of a slightvariation in reporting criteria during the first yearof the APSU study, which required only reportingchildren who were hospitalized. This might explain,in part, why there is a greater proportion of NG feeding reported by the APSU compared to the CPSP study. Surveillance through the APSU willcontinue until at least 2005. International comparisons of the data from the EOED studies will enhance our knowledge of this global problem and will contribute to our understanding of early-onset eating disordersthroughout the world.

A third of the victims were less than seven years old; only 15% of the children were adequatelyrestrained. Five out of 20 (25%) children were left paraplegic. Seat belts save lives, but if worn incorrectly they can cause important abdominal and lumbar spine injuries. There is an urgent need for aggressive education efforts to ensure adequate child restraint use inmotor vehicles. Background The use of seat belts has clearly reduced fatalities andseverity of injuries in motor vehicle crashes. But withthe increasing use of seat belts, a new association ofinjuries has emerged among adults and children involved in motor vehicle crashes. The 'seat-belt syndrome' was first described by Garrett andBraunstein in 1962 and refers to injuries to theintestinal viscera and to the lumbar spine associatedwith seat-belt restraints. Children are especiallyvulnerable to these injuries, as their intra-abdominal organs are less protected by the thorax and pelvis, they have a lower centre of gravity and their iliac crests areless developed than those of adults, allowing the beltto ride up over the abdomen. T o date, there have beenvery few paediatric studies on the incidence of seat-belt syndrome. In fact, most current knowledge comes from case reports or studies done in limited regional areas. In these studies the number of cases wasrelatively low, ranging from ten to 50 cases over years. Objectives 1) Obtain epidemiologic data on the incidence and pattern of injuries encountered in the lap-belt syndrome. 2) Identify at-risk age groups.3) Supply data that will help develop new strategies in order to adequately protect children in motorvehicles. 4) Promote education and awareness of this rare disease among health-care professionals. Case definition Any child up to and including 18 years of age restrained in a motor vehicle at the time of a crash,with either an abdominal injury, as determined by operation or CT -scan, or thoraco-lumbar spine injuries with or without spinal cord injuries. Results and discussion T wenty children with injuries compatible with lap-belt syndrome were confirmed in Canada between September 2003 and December 2004. Their ages rangedbetween two and 15 years with a median of eight. T welve were boys. The average Pediatric Trauma Score was seven (range 3-10). In five crashes, there was adeath of another passenger in the car. The median hospital stay was ten days (range 3-155 days) and the median ICU stay was five days (range 0-21 days).Although a third of the victims were less than seven years old, only one was restrained in a booster seat (wearing only a lap belt) and three were properlyrestrained with a three-point seat belt. Most of them (n=17) were seated in the back and three were passengers seated in the front of a light truck. Theseresults seem to be congruent with a recent published study (Durbin DR et al, Pediatrics 2005; 115(3):e305-9). Age-appropriate restraint use is a major protectivefactor in motor vehicle crashes; only 15% of the children described here were adequately restrained. Nineteen children had an abdominal lesion. Of these, 13 had an intestinal injury (eight small bowel Lap-belt syndrome cases September 1, 2003 to December 31, 2004TABLE 29 Duplicates 7Excluded 32Under review 20Confirmed Reported 3240C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia- severe (July 2002 to June 2004) Final Report Highlights During the two-year study, 259 cases of severe hyperbilirubinemia were confirmed inneonates. One hundred seventy-two (74%) cases were readmitted to hospital at a mean age of less than five days of life. No etiology was reported in over 70% of cases. Since many of the underlying conditions haveserious implications, it is essential to performadequate laboratory investigations to confirm the etiology. Special attention has to be given to early discharged newborns. Background Even though the occurrence of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy is very rare, it can be associated with significantmorbidity. Bilirubin encephalopathy is a condition that is unfamiliar to most paediatricians practicing today. In the 1940s and 1950s, bilirubinencephalopathy was a common complication of hyperbilirubinemia associated with Rhesus (Rh) disease and occasionally with ABO hemolyticdisease. With the introduction of exchange transfusions and Rh immunoglobulin, a reduction in the occurrence of bilirubin encephalopathy wasnoted. Also, better antenatal monitoring and the availability of intrauterine blood transfusion have eliminated most of the cases of erythroblastosisfetalis, secondary to Rh disease. Phototherapy has drastically reduced the need for exchange transfusions. In the last several years however, more frequent reports of long-term sequelae in infants with hyperbilirubinemia have been noted (AAPperforations only, two small bowel and colon lacerations, one small bowel stricture and two sigmoidlacerations), two had hepatic lesions, four had spleniclacerations, and two had a renal contusion. Onepatient had a delayed diagnosis of intestinal stricture.Thirteen patients had an abdominal wall ecchymosisor contusion associated with abdominal injury. Nine patients had lumbar spine fractures (five Chance-type fractures, two compression fractures of a vertebra, one fracture-dislocation of L2-L3 and one comminuted fracture of L2). Five of these patientspresented with a complete paraplegia below the level of the lesion and none of these recovered. With regard to other injuries, no patient had a major head trauma and six patients had thoracic injuries ranging from pulmonary contusion and hemothorax (n=4) to ruptured diaphragm (n=1) and long bone (n=4). Conclusion Lap-belt syndrome can cause severe morbidity, as 25% (five out of 20) of children were left paraplegic. Thereseemed to be a higher risk for children seated in thefront of a light truck. These preliminary results call forhigh vigilance among physicians for lap belt-associatedinjuries in restrained paediatric victims, especially ifthey present with ecchymosis, contusions or abrasionsover the abdomen. It also emphasizes the necessity toreview restraints in motor vehicles in order to protectchildren adequately, and the urgent need for aggressiveeducation efforts aimed at adequate child restraint usein motor vehicles.

Case definition T erm infants 60 days of age or less with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia who have had either: Peak serum total bilirubin >425 \u00b5mol/L or Neonatal exchange transfusion Exclusion criteria Infants who have had exchange transfusion for well-documented Rh isoimmunization disease or are lessthan 36 weeks gestational age. Results During the two years of surveillance for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, 367 cases were reported (T able 30). Of these, 259 cases met thecriteria for inclusion in this study. Duplicationof reporting occurred in 43 cases, 47 cases werediscarded and a further 18 did not return the detailedreporting form. The estimated incidence rate was 21.8 cases per 100,000 live births, calculated from a birth cohort of 300,000 per year. The demographic characteristics of these infants are shown in T able 31. As expected from our inclusioncriteria, the mean gestational age was 38.5 weeks with a birth weight of 3,360 g. The average maternal age was 29.8 years. Of the 259 confirmed cases,most were reported from Ontario (n=97), Alberta(n=70) and Quebec (n=42) (T able 32). The vastmajority of neonates were readmitted to hospital(74%) and the mean age of presentation was less than five days. As the majority of Canadian women initiate breast-feeding, it is not surprising that nearlyStatement, 2001; Johnson, 1998). Also, more bilirubin encephalopathy associated with extremelyhigh serum bilirubin levels from infants whoappeared to be healthy, breast-fed with no evidence of obvious hemolytic disease (Rh disease or other antibody-related hemolysis) were reported (Penn etal, 1994; MacDonald et al, 1995; Maisels et al, 1995;Harris et al, 2001). Based on epidemiological studies, a number of risk factors have been found to be associated with severe hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn. These include: jaundice presenting in the first 24 hours, jaundicenoted at discharge from the hospital, previous sibling with jaundice, gestational age of 35-38 weeks, breast- feeding, and infant bruising and cephalhematoma(Dennery et al, 2001; Newman et al, 2000). Additional risk factors identified by laboratory investigations include Rh and ABO incompatibilityand G6PD deficiency. The frequency of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia during the current era has not been well documented. Attempts to better quantify its frequency, etiologies and associated risk factors inCanada would be of value prior to identifying strategies for risk reduction. Information obtained from a screening program for the detection ofglucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency or routine determination of blood group and Coombs' analysis on cord blood may help usto achieve risk reduction. Objective The main objective of the study is to obtainepidemiological data regarding: the incidence of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy, the burden of illness with regards to medical treatment (phototherapy, transfusions and exchange transfusions), the neurodevelopmental short-term outcome. Attempts will be made to identify the timing of presentation of jaundice, etiology and associated triggering or risk factors.

Infants born to parents of other ethnic populations were over-represented inthis study, relative to the ethnic makeup of the general Canadian population. The cause of severe hyperbilirubinemia was identified in about a third of the cases (93 of 259cases) (T able 33). ABO incompatibility (n=48) was the most common followed by G6PD deficiency (n=20). diagnosis included: unstable hemoglobin andcongenital hypothyroidism (n=1 of each). The average peak bilirubin reported was 468 \u00b5mol/litre, with a range of 137-773 \u00b5mol/litre. The infant with a bilirubin level of 137 \u00b5mol/litre required an early exchange transfusion. Phototherapy was required in 99.5% of the neonates for a mean duration of57.6 hours (4-216). T wenty-two percent (22%) of the neonates had an exchange transfusion. Non- standard treatments included IVIG, albumin andphenobarbital. Conclusions neonates with 74% of cases82% of these infants were exclusively breast- fed; 18% were either bottle-fed or received a combination of both.

ABO incompatibility and G6PD deficiency were identifiedas important etiological agents in screened infants. In over 70% of reported cases, the underlying etiology could not be identified. It is likely that many of thesecases were not completely evaluated at the time of their hospital admission. Since this study relied on voluntary reporting, and not chart reviews, we areunable to always differentiate whether incomplete data reporting was due to incomplete investigation. These findings highlight the importance of increasing the awareness of physicians responsible for the care ofjaundiced neonates. One should perform a complete hematological workup including a CBC, peripheral smear, a screening for maternal and infant bloodgroups and a Coombs' and G6PD tests. However, in addition to performing an adequate neonatal screening, it seems that evaluation of the condition ofjaundiced infants at discharge is of great importance and special attention should be given to breast-fed newborns to prevent readmissions. Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and its associated long-term neurological sequelae is apotentially preventable disorder. Several of the cases in this study were neurologically abnormal at the time of presentation with hypotonia, decreasedresponsiveness, abnormal cry and seizures. Although this study was not designed to assess the incidence of long-term neurological disease, such as kernicterus,a subsequent study addressing prevalence of kernicterus and its associated morbidity would be invaluable.

The majority (54%) were cases with OI type I, followed by OI IV (23%), III (15%) and II (8%). There were no reports of OI types V , VI or VII. One patient was evaluated for physical abuse prior to being diagnosed with OI. Nine of the 13 cases are presently receiving treatment with a bisphosphonate agent. Background The clinical spectrum of osteogenesis imperfecta Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable form of osteoporosis that usually presents in childhood. Four different types of OI are commonly distinguishedon the basis of clinical features and disease severity,according to the classification proposed by Sillence.Patients with OI type I have a mild phenotype withnormal or near-normal height and typically blue sclerae, while OI type II is usually lethal in the perinatal period. OI type III, known as progressivedeforming OI, is the most severe form in childrensurviving the neonatal period. These patients havea characteristic phenotype, including extreme shortstature, severe deformity of the spine, thoracic cage and extremities, white or blue sclerae and often a triangular facies. Patients with a moderate to severeform of the disease who do not fit one of the abovedescriptions are classified with OI type IV; as such,this group is extremely heterogeneous. Accordingto Sillence and to Lubs, patients with the type I phenotype represent 60% of patients with OI, followed by OI type III (20%), type II (10%) andtype IV (<10%).44C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S for children with severe OI has improved remarkably through the administration of cyclical intravenous pamidronate, in conjunction with multi-disciplinary (surgical and rehabilitative) care. Now that effective treatment is available, prompt diagnosis and initiation of medical and supportive therapy during early life are paramount to enhancing the quality of life for patients with OI. In addition to intravenous pamidronate, studies of other bisphosphonates, including oral agents, are ongoing with the aim to ultimately provide clinicians with a variety of treatment options for patients with OI of differing severities. The need for current incidence data The most reliable estimates of the frequency of OI to date are based upon reports of fractures occurring in the newborn period. However, neonatal fractures are unlikely in OI type I and may or may not occur in OI types III to VII. While the incidence of the disease is estimated to be 1:20,000 to 1:60,000 live births, the true incidence of OI is likely to be much higher.These estimates were established more than 15 years ago, before newer diagnostic techniques (collagen mutation analysis, bone densitometry) became widely available. Objectives Primary T o determine the incidence of OI in Canada by ascertaining all newly diagnosed cases over a two-year period. Secondary 1) T o raise physician awareness in Canada regarding OI in general and the novel forms in particular, so that diagnoses of OI can be made in a timely fashion, and appropriate treatment can be initiated during the critical years of bone growth and development. 2) T o identify patients and/or kindreds with novel OI forms (OI types V to VII), for whom the genetic basis is presently unknown, in order toIn the majority of cases, OI is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, though autosomalrecessive transmission and gonadal mosaicism have also been described. In about 85% of OI patients, mutations in the genes encoding type I collagen,COL1A1 and COL1A2, can be found. Thus, although collagen type I mutations are frequent in OI, the lack of a detectable mutation does not ruleout the diagnosis. The Sillence classification for OI has recently been expanded by characterizing three additionalphenotypes with distinct clinical and histological features (named OI types V , VI and VII). Patients with OI type V demonstrate a striking radiologicaltriad of hypertrophic callus formation, interosseouscalcification of the forearm, and a dense metaphysealband under the growth plate. The inheritancesuggests autosomal dominant transmission. Patients with the OI type VI phenotype show subtle distinguishing clinical features, such as normalsclerae and teeth. There is a moderate elevation inalkaline phosphatase levels, as well as characteristichistological features that include increased osteoidthickness and disordered bone lamellation. Despite the mineralization defect at the bone tissue level, there is no evidence for a disorder of mineralmetabolism, and mineralization of the growth plateis unaffected. The mode of inheritance in OI type VIis unknown. OI type VII follows autosomal recessiveinheritance, recently described in a consanguineous First Nations community from Northern Quebec. Rhizomelia and coxa vara are striking characteristicsof the disease, associated with slightly blue sclerae,normal dentition, and moderately severe long bonedeformity. This form of OI has been linked tochromosome 3p, outside the type I collagen loci. The precise genetic defect in OI type VII remains to be elucidated. The changing face of OI: Bisphosphonate therapy Frequent fractures and the resulting pain and immobilization are major causes of morbidity among patients with OI. In recent years, the quality of life45C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S obtain clinical and genetic information which may ultimately lead to mutation identification. 3) T o determine whether the OI type VII phenotype, presently only reported in a Northern Quebec First Nations kindred, is present in other First Nations communities or other ethnic groups. 4) T o determine whether a geographic distribution of OI exists, so that regions in need of a local OI intervention program (including medical, orthopedic and rehabilitative care) can beidentified. 5) T o educate medical health providers and child welfare workers regarding the heterogeneousmanifestations of OI, with the aim of facilitating the differentiation of the abused child from the child with congenital bone fragility due to OI.This, in turn, may prevent or minimize false allegations of child abuse. Case definition Inclusion criteriaAny child up to and including 18 years of age with: a new diagnosis of OI, defined as a congenital bone fragility condition associated with low bone mass; and clinical features in keeping with a diagnosis of OI types I to VII (see T able 1 of the protocol). Exclusion criteria Bone fragility due to other causes, including genetic disorders (e.g., Ehlers Danlos syndrome),iatrogens idiopathic juvenileosteoporosis. Fractures due to child abuse. Results In the first year of the study, 41 cases of OI were reported, representing new diagnoses of OI during the study period. Of these, 13 cases have beenconfirmed (eight girls), with another seven cases presently under review. T wenty-one cases werediscarded, 11 because of duplication of reports and ten because of failure to meet the case definition (T able 34). Demographics, ethnicity and OI phenotype Of the 13 confirmed OI cases to date, eight were fromOntario. T wo other provinces had less than five confirmed cases (BC and NL). The average age at diagnosis was 5.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 5.1;range 0.3-14). Three patients were diagnosed in the first month of life, and one patient was diagnosed antenatally.

Whether the OI type I-treated cases manifest more severe type I phenotypes, as is sometimes the case, is presently under review. Principal investigator Leanne M.

Forty-six percent (46%)(6/13) of cases had sustained five to ten fractures bythe time of diagnosis, three cases had sustained morethan ten fractures and four reported fewer than fivefractures. Only one case had required orthopedic intervention. One of the cases with OI type I, who did not have a family history of OI, had beenevaluated for an allegation of physical abuse beforethe diagnosis of OI was made. Five of 13 cases had aknown family history of OI, seven did not, and theinformation was unavailable in one case. Three cases had undergone type I collagen studies as part of their evaluation, the results of which are pending. Therapeutic intervention Nine of the 13 confirmed cases were receiving bisphosphonate therapy at the time of reporting, three were not being treated medically, and theinformation was unknown in one case. Eight of the nine treated patients were prescribed intravenous pamidronate; the type of bisphosphonate was notspecified in one patient. One of the nine treated cases was participating in an institutional review board-approved (IRB) protocol at the time ofreporting; the other treated patients were offered therapy outside of research studies. Four of the nine treated cases had OI type I, the remaining five casesoffered medical therapy were diagnosed with OI type II, III or IV . The three patients who were not being treated medically at the time of reportingwere those with the mild (OI type I) phenotype. Conclusion In the first 12 months of this study, 13 OI cases ofvarious ethnicities from Ontario, British Columbiaand Newfoundland/Labrador were confirmed, the majority of whom manifested the mild OI phenotype (type I), followed by OI types IV , III and II.

Sixty-nine percent (69%) of cases were diagnosed before two years of age. All PWS cases were confirmed genetically. Significant sustained hypotonia in the first year of life associated with feeding difficulties deserve genetic methylation testing. Background Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder (abnormality of chromosome 15) withhypothalamic dysfunction leading to hyperphagia and consequent obesity with secondary sequelae of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, sleep apnea, andpotential death. Prevalence data in PWS is not well known in Canada but is drawn from estimates on other geographical locales or small population studies.The knowledge of the true Canadian prevalence of PWS will allow for improvements in health-care planning and possible prevention of cardio-respiratory consequences for PWS patients. Objectives 1) T o determine the incidence and the mean age of PWS diagnosis in Canada. 2) T o ascertain the method of PWS diagnosis: clinical and/or genetic. 3) T o create an awareness in the scientific community of PWS. Case definition Any child up to and including 18 years of age with newly diagnosed PWS confirmed clinically (PWS clinical score), and/or genetically (methylation and/or FISH [fluorescent in situ hybridisation] test). A clinical diagnosis * of PWS relies on a score derived from major and minor criteria: < 3 years: 5 points (4 from major criteria) > 3 years: 8 points (5 from major criteria) * See www.cps.ca/english/cpsp/studies/prader.htm for complete clinical scoring Results and discussion During the two-year PWS surveillance study, there were 98 reports. Of these, 53 cases met the inclusion criteria and were confirmed, 35 cases were diagnosed during the study period and 18 before. There were24 duplicates and ten exclusions. Another 11 reports are under review (T able 36). The Canadian estimated incidence of PWS is predicted at 22 cases per year.The study has so far identified more than three- quarters of the initially estimated number. Preliminary data from 28 of the 53 confirmed cases included age and clinical features summarized in T able 37. Infantile hypotonia was present in 26,infant feeding problems in 25 and rapid weight gain between one to six years of age in 12 cases. The PWS diagnosis was confirmed at a mean age of three years in 25 of the 35 cases with available data. However, 69% of cases were confirmed before twoyears of age. A few patients were diagnosed over the age of nine years; if one excludes this group, as they can skew the real age distribution, the mean age ofdiagnosis becomes 1.1 year, showing a trend to earlier confirmation of PWS (T able 38). With the advent and availability of genetic testing for PWS, as well as increased awareness in the medical community, the diagnosis can now beconfirmed at an earlier age, allowing for individualized obesity management prevention strategy programming and hopefully better outcome.

Conclusion This two-year PWS surveillance study has documented 35 new cases in Canada. All cases were confirmed genetically and although there is a trend to an earlier age at diagnosis (mean age of three years), afew patients were diagnosed over the age of nine years. Physicians should remember that patients presenting with significant sustained hypotonia in the first year of life associated with feeding difficulties deserve genetic methylation testing. One has to reinforcethe importance of early detection, diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of PWS-affected children, as the associated obesity is treatable andeven preventable in many cases.

All confirmed cases were referred for bone marrow transplant. None of the cases thus far were reported in aboriginal children. Background As part of the strategy to reduce the incidence and severity of tuberculosis (TB) in children living onreserves with endemic TB, the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch (FNIHB) of Health Canada recommends the use of the live, attenuated BCG(bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) vaccine for newborns. Sixcases of disseminated BCG infection in First Nationsand Inuit children were reported between 1993 and 2002. All six children died, four had severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), one was HIV positive andone had another immunodeficiency. The observedrate of disseminated BCG in First Nations and Inuitpopulations in Canada is 205 cases per 1,000,000doses (CI 42-600), greatly exceeding global estimates of 0.19-1.56 cases per 1,000,000 doses given. While no Canadian data is available on the incidenceof SCID, it may well be that this unusual rate ofdisseminated BCG infection is associated with a highincidence rate of SCID in the Aboriginal population.Hence, data on the incidence of SCID is required to make an evidence-based decision about the risks and benefits of continuing to offer BCG vaccine toFirst Nations and Inuit children on reserves withendemic TB, and to guide future decisions regardingdiscontinuation of BCG vaccination. Severe combined immunodeficiency is a serious, life-threatening condition with high morbidity andmortality. SCID, a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by profound abnormalities in T and Band natural killer cell development and function, was first reported more than 50 years ago. In the pasttwo decades great advances have been made in theunderstanding and treatment of SCID. A variety of molecular defects have recently been found to cause SCID, including defects in the gene encoding thecommon gamma chain deficiency. The two most common forms of SCID are the X-linked SCID (about 50% of all cases) andthose due to an ADA deficiency (about 15% to 20%). General estimates of the incidence of SCID range from 1 in 75,000-100,000 live births with higher than expected rates in Switzerland at 24.3 in 100,000 live births and in the United States Navajo population at52 in 100,000 live births. No Canadian incidence data for SCID is available. Objectives 1) T o estimate the incidence of SCID in Canada. 2) T o estimate the incidence of SCID in Aboriginal children in Canada. 3) T o describe the basic demographics, clinical features and outcomes of SCID in Canada. Case definition Report any child less than two years of age with: the clinical features of SCID (i.e., chronic diarrhea, recurrent pneumonia, failure to thrive, persistent thrush, opportunistic infections, etc.) and at least one of the following: an absolute lymphocyte count of less than 3,000/mm3 or less than 20% CD3+ T cells familial history of primary immunodeficiency. Exclusion criteria Infants with HIV infection or cystic fibrosis. Results Since the study started in April 2004, CPSP participants reported 20 cases of SCID. Of these, ninewere duplicates, two were excluded because the cases50C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S did not meet the case definition, five cases were confirmed and four cases are awaiting complete detailed case reports and/or confirmation of case status. None of the cases were of Aboriginal descent.T wo of the pending cases awaiting further detailsappear to be infants with pancytopenia who metthe case definition for low lymphocyte counts(respectively, 1.160 and 0.950). It may be that the case criteria need to be modified to specifically exclude cases of pancytopenia due to obvious causes(i.e., one case was associated with a cytogenetic defectof monosomy 7). Of the confirmed cases, there are two females and three males; all were born in Canada and none of the cases report a family history of immunodeficiency. The average age at diagnosis was 5.8 months (range2-9 months). Confirmed cases include: ADA(adenosine deaminase) SCID; and T-NK-B+ SCID. The main clinical to thrive interstitial pneumonia (60%), persistentbronchiolitis-like like lymphopenia, neutropenia, eosinophilia, and pancytopenia. All confirmed cases were referred for bone marrow transplant. T wo have received transplants andthree are pending. Severe graft-versus-host diseasedeveloped in both recipients of bone marrowtransplant; one child has died and the other remainsseverely ill in hospital (six months post-transplant).Conclusion Based on the existing estimates for the rate of SCID and the annual birth rate in Canada, the expectednumber of new cases of SCID is three to 17 per year. This data indicates that the study is within the range of expected number of new cases. Due to the numberof cases still pending, a more detailed analysis of thecases is limited. This study is ongoing until March2006, at which point a discussion on whether tocontinue the study based on the number of reported cases will take place.

The vast majority of confirmed cases were infants and toddlers with intermediate and dark skin, who had been exclusively breast-fed withoutappropriate vitamin D supplementation. The results indicate that rickets remains a major public health problem in Canada andthey reinforce the current Canadian Paediatric Society recommendation that exclusively breast-fed infants receive vitamin Dsupplementation (400 IU/day; 800 IU/dayfor infants living north of the 55 th latitude). Background Vitamin D is necessary for calcium homeostasis and for mineralization of the growing skeleton. A deficiencyin vitamin D during childhood is associated with potentially significant clinical consequences, as it leads to a mineralization defect of the growth plates (rickets)and of bone tissue (osteomalacia). Poor linear growth and skeletal deformity are hallmarks of vitamin D deficiency during childhood, in addition tohypocalcemic seizures, abnormal dentition, and delayed developmental milestones. The disease is entirely preventable through simple measures, such as ensuringadequate dietary intake of vitamin D or administration of a daily supplement. Recent literature has proposed that vitamin D deficiency rickets continues to be a public health issue worldwide, and clinical experience suggests that itremains an issue in Canada. This is despite the Canadian regulations requiring that all fluid dairy products (excluding yogurt drinks) be fortified withvitamin D, because infants and children living in Canada cannot depend upon adequate skin exposure to sunlight for vitamin D synthesis. Furthermore, theCanadian Paediatric Society (CPS) has recommended that all exclusively breast-fed infants receive a daily supplement of oral vitamin D, since breast milk is not arich source of this nutrient. Despite these preventive measures, vitamin D deficiency rickets appears all too frequently in Canada, with certain geo-ethnic groupscontinuing to be at heightened risk for developing the disease. The main purpose of this study has been to determine the incidence of vitamin D deficiency ricketsamong children living in Canada by ascertaining reports of all newly diagnosed cases between July 2002 and June 2004, inclusively. Objectives 1) T o ascertain the incidence of simple vitamin D deficiency (nutritional rickets) among childrenliving in Canada by identifying all newly diagnosed cases over a two-year period. 2) T o obtain demographic and medical information to determine the profile of children at risk fordeveloping the disease. 3) T o evaluate the efficacy of current strategies to prevent the development of the disease inCanada. 4) T o supply data that will assist with the development of novel public health policies to preventnutritional rickets among children living in Canada. Case definition Children up to and including 18 years of age with calcipenic rickets secondary to simple vitamin D deficiency (also known as nutritional rickets). Inclusion criteria 1) Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) 2) Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase Exclusion criteria 1) Vitamin D deficiency rickets associated with underlying disease, such as fat malabsorption,liver disease and renal insufficiency, and withillnesses necessitating total parenteral nutrition. 2) Vitamin D deficiency secondary to heritable disorders of vitamin D metabolism, including:1-hydroxylase deficiency (pseudo-vitamin D deficiency rickets, PDDR) vitamin D receptor defects (hypocalcemic vitamin D resistant rickets, HVDRR).52C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S 3) Phosphopenic rickets of any etiology (where hypophosphatemia is the primary cause of therickets, and not due to calcipenic rickets with secondary hyperparathyroidism). Results Between July 2002 and June 2004, there were 150 reports of vitamin D deficiency rickets among children living in Canada, of which 104 were confirmed cases, 30 were duplicates, 12 were discarded because of failureto meet the inclusion criteria and four are still under review. A summary of the results is presented in T able 40. Demographic data Case demographic data are presented in T able 41. The majority of confirmed vitamin D deficiency cases(54.8%) were from Ontario, with an additional 13.5%from Quebec, 12.5% from Alberta, and the remaining19.2% divided among British Columbia, Manitoba,Northwest T erritories, Nunavut, Saskatchewan, NewBrunswick and Nova Scotia. There were no confirmedcases of rickets from the Yukon, Prince Edward Islandor Newfoundland/Labrador. The gender was indicatedfor 97% of the cases, with 46% being female and51% male. The mean age at diagnosis was 1.37 years(standard deviations [SD] 0.88; range 0.03-6.34).T wenty-nine percent (29%) of cases to Canada in the months precedingdiagnosis. Thirty-three percent (33%) of the confirmedcases were Black, 12.5% wereMiddle Eastern, 11.5% were Inuit, wereCaucasian, 1% was Latin American and 1% was Asian,while the ancestry was not indicated in the remaining17.3% of cases. The mean maternal age at the time ofdelivery was 28 years (SD 6.2; range 15-39). Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency Eighty-seven and one-half percent (87.5%) of the confirmed cases were classified as intermediate- ordark-skinned. However, fair-skinned children living in Canada were not exempt from developing the disease, as they comprised 10.6% (11/104) of theconfirmed cases. Skin colour was not indicated for 1.9% of the cases. T wenty-one of 104 mothers wore a maternal head covering during, and following,pregnancy. Physicians reported that 96.2% of the cases had been breast-fed, three cases were fed infant formula, and the feeding status was not indicatedin the remaining confirmed cases. As expected, the vast majority of the cases (86.5%, 90/104) had not received vitamin D supplementation prior tothe development of the disease. In the remaining 13.5% of cases, supplementation with vitamin D was either not indicated on the case report form orwas unreliably administered by caregivers prior to diagnosis. Only 12.5% of mothers were documented as having received vitamin D supplementationduring pregnancy. Following delivery, this number fell to 4.8%, and the majority of mothers did not drink milk in the post-natal period. Milk allergiesand sunscreen use did not appear to be significant risk factors for vitamin D deficiency among children in Canada, as only six of the confirmed casesmanifested a milk allergy, while frequent sunscreen use was documented in only two of the cases.

T wenty-five percent(25%) of patients presented with a combination ofthese signs and symptoms. Analysis of the serumbiochemical parameters of bone and mineralmetabolism prior to initiation of vitamin D therapyrevealed a mean alkaline phosphatase level of 1,237 U/L(range 186-6,067). A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level priorto treatment was available in 78 of the 104 confirmedcases, with a mean value of 21.4 nmol/L (SD 16.7; range1-84). A total calcium level prior to treatment wasavailable in 83 of the 104 confirmed cases, giving amean value of 1.94 mmol/L (SD 0.43; range 1.07-2.60). Conclusions Over the two years of this surveillance study, 104 casesof nutritional rickets were confirmed among children,predominantly infants and toddlers, residing inCanada. Intermediate- and dark-skinned childrenwho were breast-fed without appropriate vitamin Dsupplementation were at greatest risk for developingthe disease, although fair-skinned children were notexempt from the disease. A proportion of the motherswere veiled, and most did not receive vitamin Dsupplementation following delivery, nor did they ingestmilk (thus eliminating a potential dietary sourceof vitamin D). Significant morbidity was present atdiagnosis in most of the confirmed cases, includinglimb deformity, seizures, failure to thrive, fracturesand delayed developmental milestones. While breast milk should continue to be advocated as the ideal nutritional source for infants and children, itmust be recognized that breast milk is not a rich sourceof vitamin D. This becomes particularly relevant forinfants living in northern countries such as Canada. Inview of our northern latitude, it has been recommendedby the CPS since 1998 that all exclusively breast-fedinfants receive supplementation with oral vitamin D(400 IU/day; 800 IU/day for infants living north of the55 th latitude). However, the results of this studyhighlight that the CPS position statement regarding vitamin D supplementation has not reached itsfull audience, and as such has not been universallyimplemented by health-care providers. Though it isnot surprising that children with the greatest numberof risk factors for vitamin D deficiency were themost frequently diagnosed, it is surprising that thiscondition is being detected in a country with readyaccess to vitamin D supplementation and a clearrecommendation from the country's national paediatricorganization for prevention of the disease. Given the potential for significant morbidity associated with rickets, there is an urgent need for heightenedawareness among health-care providers and the generalpublic to prevent the condition. Studies to evaluate the success of educational interventions are a reasonable next step. Consideration should also be given to therole of financial barriers in ensuring that vitamin Dis administered to all breast-fed infants in Canada.Alternate modes of vitamin D therapy to ensureadequate stores during breast-feeding, such as antenatal treatment of vitamin D-deficient mothers, are worthy of future investigations. Finally, the potential role ofvitamin D deficiency in the development of seriouschildhood and adult illnesses, including type I diabetes,bone fragility and multiple sclerosis, remains animportant area of current study.

Approximately 10% of infected infants exhibit significant clinical illness in the newborn period with avariety of manifestations, including poor growth, microcephaly, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Almost all of these infantswill go on to have later neurologic sequelae. Even if asymptomatic at birth, approximately 5% to 17% will have neurodevelopmental abnormalities,including sensorineural hearing loss, which may only become apparent in infancy or later in childhood. Congenital CMV infection is a difficult diagnosis toprove retrospectively, as definite diagnosis requires isolation of the virus from the newborn in the first three weeks of life. Diagnosis beyond that age mayindicate acquired infection from exposure to virus in the birth canal or breast milk. Newborns often do not produce specific IgM after early fetal infectionso a \"TORCH screen\" is a poor way of making the diagnosis. This infection has devastating consequences and is of great public health significance. Active surveillance for congenital CMV infection is timelyas intervention strategies are on the horizon. Careful follow-up of infected infants should be an integral part of a universal newborn hearing screeningprogram, antiviral therapy is showing promise and vaccines are in active development.This study will gather Canadian data on identified cases of congenital CMV infection. This surveillance affords two unique opportunities for externalvalidation. There will be simultaneous laboratory- based surveillance of diagnostic virology labs in Canada to validate case ascertainment by the CPSP .Comparisons will also be made between results of similar surveillance done by the Australian and British surveillance units.

At both loci inheritance is autosomal dominant with DM1 associated witha CTG trinucleotide expansion on chromosome 19q13 and DM2 with a tetranucleotide expansion at 3q21. The primary pathogenesis is feltto be related to the effect of large accumulations of mutant mRNA in the nucleus of cells. In DM1 only, a more severe clinical phenotype and earlier age of onset can occur over subsequentgenerations, as the unstable trinucleotide repeatcarried by the parent, almost always the mother,can expand further during gametogenesis. This phenomenon is known as genetic anticipation and, in this context, leads eventually to an infant withcongenital myotonic dystrophy (CMD). Althoughthere can be a wide spectrum of symptomatology,the child often has evidence of hypotonia, weakness,feeding difficulties and mechanical respiratory failure requiring intubation and ventilation immediately after birth. Although the genetic and pathophysiological aspects of CMD are rapidly being discovered, epidemiologyand clinical knowledge are still largely based onanecdotal experience. For example, the relationshipbetween genotype and phenotype remains unclearand the decisions related to cases of children requiring prolonged neonatal ventilation are not consistent. This study has chosen a broad definitionof CMD to gather information on the full spectrumof morbidity and health resources needed forchildren with signs and symptoms of myotonicdystrophy in the newborn period. As the genetic confirmation of the disorder typically requires several weeks, much valuable clinical informationwill be known to the reporting paediatrician by thetime the diagnosis is confirmed. In addition, a cohortstudy will be undertaken, outside the CPSP , withconsenting families to understand long-term clinical outcomes. Because CMD is rare the CPSP is the ideal mechanism to ascertain a population-based profileof the epidemiology and neonatal characteristics of this unique genetic disorder.

This is true even though maltreatment comprises a major cause of mortality and morbidity for Canadianchildren and youth. The literature on the incidence of child maltreatment in Canada is limited to two main studies. The Canadian Incidence of ReportedChild Abuse and Neglect study found that in 1998,56C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S 2.1% of children were investigated for maltreatment, and abuse was substantiated in nearly a half of thesecases. This is likely an underestimate of the true incidence as many cases of child abuse are not reported. The second study was a recently published ten-year chart review of 364 cases of shaken baby syndrome(SBS) treated at 11 Canadian paediatric centres. This study excluded cases of inflicted injury that did not involve evidence of shaking and included only hospitalcases of SBS, thereby limiting the generalisability of its findings. One quarter of the cases presented with non- specific signs, and 40% had no sign of external injury,making the diagnosis difficult and highly dependent on the physician's awareness of the possibility of child abuse. Several studies have shown that physicians feelunprepared and have inadequate knowledge to deal with cases of abuse and neglect. In 2001, only three of 16 Canadian paediatric academic centres reportedmandatory clinical training in child protection for paediatric residents. Although rare, cases of inflicted head injury are of great clinical importance, as a large proportion of them result in permanent neurological deficits; 19% of the children in the SBS study died and 75% had an impairment at the time of hospital discharge. As a result there is much support for tracking these injuries. Thus, the purpose of this study is to conduct active surveillance for head injury secondary to suspected maltreatment in Canadian children. In order to document as completely as possible the presenting picture, the study will include children and youth up to 14 years of age. The investigators hope that this study will raise awareness among physicians, better define the clinical presentation, document the patterns of presentation and the burden of illness, and direct strategies forprimary, secondary and tertiary prevention of these serious injuries.Principal investigator Morag Mackay, Plan-it-Safe, Children's Hospital of K1H 8L1; e-mail: m.mackay@childsafetyeurope.org Co-investigators MB, outhProtection Program, Children's Hospital of EasternOntario T ammy Clifford, PhD, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute Gilles Fortin, MD, Child and Y outh Protective Services, H\u00f4pital Sainte-Justine Jim King, MD, Division of Paediatric Medicine, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Amy Plint, MD, Emergency Department, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Michelle Ward, MD, Child and Y outh Protection Program, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme Adehydrogenasedeficiency (September 2005 to August 2007) \"Active surveillance of MCAD deficiency is timely as it will allow for comparison between provinces withand without universal newborn screening.\" Fatty acid oxidation disorders are a common cause of unrecognized morbidity and mortality in childhood. Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is the most frequent inheritedfatty acid oxidation disorder with an incidence ofabout 1 in 10,000-20,000. Although the diseasecan occur at any time in life, the commonestpresentation is between three months to two years.57C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Usually, a relatively well child decompensates during an acute illness associated with vomiting anddevelops hypoglycemia, mild hepatomegaly andaltered sensorium. Other biochemical features include hypoketosis, mild hyperammonemia and elevation in liver enzymes. If unrecognized, theclinical picture can worsen with seizures, coma,residual neurological deficits and subsequentdevelopmental delay. At the initial presentation,the mortality risk is as high as 25%. The inheritance of MCAD deficiency is autosomal recessive. Prognosis is excellent once the diagnosis is made and treatment initiated early thus making a strong argument for newborn screening. MCAD deficiency still remains underdiagnosed and there is very little incidence data for the Canadian population. With the advent of tandem mass spectrometry, neonatal screening for MCADdeficiency is now occurring in four provinces (BC, SK, NS, PE). Active surveillance of MCAD deficiency is timely as it will allow for comparison between provinces with and without universal newborn screening. This study will provide data on incidence, burden of illness andclinical outcome, which might guide public health policy in terms of advocating for universal newborn screening for MCAD deficiency.

Children experiencing acquireddemyelination face an uncertain future, as a small proportion will go on to experience recurrent demyelinating attacks that characterize MultipleSclerosis (MS). The Paediatric Demyelinating Disease Network initiated a survey to determine the number of children in Canada experiencing acquired demyelination and to determine the proportion ofthose children who were subsequently diagnosed with MS. The study also inquired whether MS was considered by the treating physician. The survey was sent out to 2,320 paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists across Canada. Results ofthe 611 responses (26%) indicated that 130 (21%) had cared for a child with acquired demyelination within the last two years. A total of 285 patientswere reported. Each paediatrician had seen from one to 60 patients, with an average of 2.3 per paediatrician. Six of the 130 respondents did notindicate the number of patients they had assessed. Forty-six of the 285 patients with demyelination (16.14%) experienced recurrent demyelinatingepisodes and were subsequently diagnosed with MS. Paediatricians were asked whether the possibility of recurrent demyelination was entertained, as many health-care professionals may not consider MS as a possible diagnosis of an initial demyelinating event.Eighty-four of the 130 paediatricians (65%) who have seen a case indicated that they considered MSas a possible outcome of acute demyelination in children. The CPSP Steering Committee has since approved a full two-year study on acquired demyelinatingsyndromes of the CNS that began in April 2004. T o date, 52 patients with acute demyelination have been reported. Study results are found on page 15.A follow-up survey will be sent out at study completion to assess whether a greater proportion of paediatricians are considering MS as a potentialoutcome in patients experiencing a first demyelinating episode. Demyelination in Canada may not be as rare as previously thought. Is it hoped that the study will successfully assess the incidence and clinical featuresof paediatric demyelination in Canada as well as increase awareness among paediatricians of paediatric MS as an outcome of demyelination. Theadvent of disease-modifying therapies for MS and the recent evidence of improved long-term outcome associated with early therapy initiation emphasizethe need for prompt diagnosis and coordinated care for children affected with MS.

The survey aimed to establish background rates of paediatrician clinical encounterswith acute flaccid paralysis cases and to explore their most recent experiences with follow-up laboratory investigations for stool testing. A total of 628 paediatricians responded by mail and an additional 13 respondents participated in anonline version of the survey posted on the CPS web page. The overall response rate was 27% (641/2,378). Of those who participated in the survey, 463/641 (72%) reported that they would collect stool cultureswithin 14 days of onset of paralysis, which is theWHO recommended time frame for collection of viable stool specimens for isolation of polioviruses. As expected, AFP is a rare condition and only 51/641 (8%) participating paediatricians reportedhaving seen a case in the two years. Ofthese, 21/51 (41%) paediatricians reported ordering stool cultures for isolation of polioviruses. Thirteen (62%) of the 21 who ordered stool cultures reportedreceiving results from the laboratory, while theremaining six (28%) reported unknown orunsatisfactory results. Of the 26 who did not order stool cultures (26/51), the main reasons specified fell into the followingcategories: patient referred to a specialist/paediatricneurologist (8/26); clinical presentation or othertests preferred over stool testing (7/26); patientpresented too late for stool testing (1/26); not specified (10/26). Discussion and next steps The results from this survey are consistent with AFP surveillance data. From 1993 to 2003, surveillancedata indicate that while less than 50% of AFP caseshad stool collected for isolation of polioviruses, over90% had one or more neurological investigation conducted. Given that over 90% of AFP cases in Canada are diagnosed as either Guillain-Barr\u00e9syndrome or transverse myelitis, clinical signs andsymptoms consistent with these conditions mayfavour neurological investigation and thereby pre-empt polio-specific investigations. Though only three AFP cases were diagnosed as having had an acute infectious process (due to non-polioenterovirus infections) during the last decade, allof three had polio-specific stool and/or serologicinvestigations completed. Findings from the one-time survey together with the analysis of ten years of surveillance data indicatethat while the majority of paediatricians are aware ofthe recommended time frame for polio specific stool collection, the WHO surveillance target of stool collection for 80% of AFP cases is not being met and deficiencies exist in laboratory follow-up andfeedback of results. The polio eradication project has been one of the greatest public health challenges in history. Despiteglobal efforts, the disease remains endemic in sixcountries in Africa and Asia and threatens to re-establish transmission in several neighbouring countries. Countries and continents certified as polio-free remain at risk of wild virus importationfrom endemic areas. Increasing globalizationunderscores this risk. Therefore, reliable andeffective surveillance systems continue to be vitalfor detecting possible importation of wild and vaccine-derived poliovirus. While Canada remains committed to global polio eradication efforts through active surveillance ofAFP , surveillance data indicate that key targetsof surveillance system performance are not beingmet. Feasibility and appropriateness of alternatesurveillance indicators should be explored for Canada where specialized diagnostic investigations are more readily available. T o this end, a moredetailed survey of paediatric neurologists is plannedto fully explore and quantify reasons why viral stoolcultures are not regularly requested. The goal of thisfollow-up survey is to summarize current practices in AFP surveillance in Canada and to consider the potential for alternate criteria for AFP surveillanceindicators.60C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Principal survey investigator Jeannette Macey, Immunization and Respiratory Infections Division, Public Health Agencyof Canada, T unney's Respiratory Infections Division, Public Health Agency of Canada Infant bath seats (June 2004) The Consumer Product Safety Bureau of Health Canada had become aware of an infant drowninghazard linked to the use of infant bath seats and bath rings. Accordingly, Health Canada made use of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program to obtaina better understanding of the frequency and extentof injuries, near-miss drownings and drowningsassociated with infant bath seats and bath rings in Canada. This was accomplished by surveying the experience of Canadian paediatricians treating suchincidents, both in hospitals and private practices.The results stated in this summary represent one of anumber of sources of data Health Canada hascollected concerning incidents involving the use of infant bath seats and bath rings. The survey question was designed to focus on infants as they are considered the target group for use ofthese products. The expected age range for the use ofthis product is from six to nine months, representing the time frame in which an infant can sit unassisted, to when they can pull to a standing position.However, several incidents reported to HealthCanada have involved infants outside this age range. A total of 1,087 paediatricians returned the survey, representing an overall return rate of 47.1%. Of the returned forms, 25 were received from paediatricianswho recalled caring for one or more infants who had experienced injuries, near-miss drownings, ordrownings related to the use of an infant bath seat orbath ring in the last two years. Seven paediatricians indicated that they would not have seen this type of incident due to the nature of their work. In all, 2.3% of respondents reported treating one or more injuries, near-miss drownings, or drownings related to the use of infant bath seats and bath ringsduring the last two years. The breakdown of the dataindicated that respondents treated a minimum of34 infants with incidents including: 20 injuries(scrapes, cuts, bruises), 12 near-miss drownings, and two deaths. Many of the paediatricians included comments on the returned survey. Nine noted lack of supervision,not the product itself, as the problem; fourcommented that these were dangerous devices and should be removed from the market; three were not aware that these types of products existed; threeadded that they frequently receive questions fromparents about these products; and two indicated theyused these products themselves for their children. Conclusions The findings of this survey offer a profile of the experience of Canadian paediatricians in treating, in the last two years, injuries, near-miss drownings, anddrownings associated with infant bath seats or bathrings. The Consumer Product Safety Bureau of Health Canada has received reports of nine injuries, 19 near- miss drownings, and 11 drowning deaths linked tothe use of infant bath seats and bath rings since1983. However, of these reported incidents, oneinjury, six near-miss drownings, and nine deaths haveoccurred in the last five years. In the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has received reports of 163 injuries or near-missdrownings and 106 deaths due to the use of theseproducts from January 1983 through October 2003.The Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program61C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S survey indicated that among paediatricians who responded to this survey, 2.3% have treated one or more infants for injuries, near-miss drownings, or drownings in the last two years. T ypically, drownings linked to bath seats and bath rings occur as a result of the infant bath seatbecoming unstable and tipping over in the bath, the infant climbing out of the infant bath seat, or the infant slipping through the leg opening and becomelodged under water. Despite clear warning labelsstating Prevent drowning. Never leave child unattended on the older bath seat models and Prevent drowning. Always keep baby within arm's reach on the newer models, in the majority of incidents, the infant had been left unattended or under the supervision of asibling. In the months ahead, Health Canada will review options to consider the public health implications of the survey findings. In addition, an advisory and a public education bulletin will be issued and postedon the Consumer Product Safety website: www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hecs-sesc/cps/index.htm Principal survey investigator Sheila Davidson, BSc, BA, Mechanical and Electrical Division, Consumer Product Safety,Product Safety Program, Healthy Environmentsand Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, 123 Slater St, AL Ottawa ON K1A 0K9; tel.: 613-952-8523; fax: 613-952-1994;e-mail: Sheila_Davidson@hc-sc.gc.caADR Tips of the Month In January 2004 a study on serious and life- threatening adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was added to the CPSP to better understand the incidence and nature of ADRs in children. Studyresults are found on page 24. T o build both supportfor and awareness of the study, in addition toproviding a mechanism for the dissemination of newdrug safety information, ' ADR Tips of the Month' was launched. The tips, sent on a monthly basis with the initial reporting form, have been developed witha short, simple and consistent format. Informationconveyed has ranged from specific drug safetywarnings relevant to the treatment of children, suchas SSRI reuptake inhibitors), over-the-counter medications, to general remindersfor the completion of data elements on detailedreporting forms. T o allow for wider dissemination ofthe information, all tips are posted on the CPSPwebsite. T o establish the level of support for this new awareness strategy, a simple survey was sent to CPSPparticipants in November 2004. Results suggest thatthe 'Tips of the Month' are relevant and effective at meeting the needs and interests of the participants. Seventy-nine percent (79%) of respondentsindicated that they read the tips and of theserespondents, 77% found them useful. Numerouscomments and suggestions were provided supportingthe short, simple format. The practical nature of the messages conveyed was viewed positively. Principal investigator Margaret Zimmerman, Patient Safety Section, Policy and Partnership Division, Marketed Health Products Directorate, Health Products and S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S International Developments The International Network of PaediatricSurveillance Units (INoPSU), established in 1998, continuesto enhance collaboration between national paediatric surveillance units. INoPSU provides a unique opportunity for simultaneous cross- sectional studies of rare diseases in populations with diverse geographic and ethnic characteristics. Currently worldwide, there are 13 national paediatric surveillance units that are full members of INoPSU: Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Switzerland, and Wales. The Cyprus/ Greece surveillance unit is an affiliate member until such time as it fulfills the requirements of full membership. As well, the British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit is an associate member. In 2004 Trinidad and T obago also became an associate member. Argentina is currently developing a surveillance unit.The first formal INoPSU meeting was held in Ottawa in June 2000, with a second meeting in Y ork, England, in April 2002. As a result of these successes, a third INoPSU meeting was held in Portugal in the spring of 2004. The fourth INoPSU conference will be hosted by the BPSU in London, England, in the spring of 2006. INoPSU collaboration in action 24th International Congress of Paediatrics Dr. Elizabeth Elliot from Australia and Dr. Danielle Grenier and Andrea Medaglia from Canada represented INoPSU at the International Paediatric Association conference in Cancun, Mexico, August 15-20, 2004. The symposium session presented collaborative INoPSU research possibilities and achievements through various examples. The session was well received and created both discussion and interest, in particular, from Argentinean, Mexican and V enezuelan delegates. Time will tell whether or not more North and South American countries will join INoPSU but from initial interactions, prospects look promising. Argentina Following in the footsteps of the British PaediatricSurveillance Unit, who helped Canada, Portugal, and T rinidad and T obago's respective units get off to a good start, CPSP representatives had the opportunity and privilege to work with Argentinean colleagues as they were creating a Perinatal Network in Buenos Aires City and ten Buenos Aires Provinces and sought guidance on integrating and implementing an active surveillance system for neonatal-perinatal problems. A collaborative program held in Buenos Aires in July 2004 included interactive workshops on the nutsFIGURE 8 63C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S and bolts of establishing and running an active surveillance program as well as neonatal study results to illustrate the versatility and potential of this epidemiological tool. This collaborative endeavour was most enlightening and enriching for all. The Argentinean Paediatric Society and programparticipants are committed to integrating active surveillance into their Perinatal Network Project and are currently selecting their first research studies and determining future priorities. The CPSP looks forward to continued collaboration and has encouraged the Argentinean Network to establish links with INoPSU and apply for membership in 2006.

Like any other treatment, CAM has the potential for causing adverse events. The study conducted through the Australia Paediatric Surveillance Unit is the first systematic study in Australian children of adverse events due to CAM. Several areas of particular concern have been identified: Significant dangers associated with dietary restriction including dehydration and malnutrition (resulting in one death). Potential risks of CAM use in pregnancy. Potential risks from overdose of CAM and the need for safe storage/child resistant packaging. In one child, ingestion of an herbal remedy forvomiting resulted in acute hepatic toxicityrequiring liver transplantation. Dangers associated with substituting conventional medication with CAM. In one child, substitution of a CAM for an anti-epileptic agent resulted in life-threatening seizures. Clinicians need to ask about CAM use and be prepared to discuss potential benefits and risks involved. Britain The BPSU major achievement of the past year wassecuring five years of funding from the Department of Health. The Royal College of Paediatric and Child Health established the Sir Peter Tizard bursary for paediatricians to undertake an epidemiological study using the BPSU. The first bursary was awarded for a study on childhood thyrotoxicosis and a second bursary will be looking at paediatric malaria. T wo new studies involved expanding the list of participants:the study on non-type 1 diabetes added the active surveillance of diabetic nurse specialists, and the study of early-onset eating disorders in children less than 13 years will involve the active surveillance of child and adolescent psychiatrists. Another important endeavour was the production of two brochures: a public information leaflet on BPSU activities and an introduction to the BPSU program infrastructure, aims and achievements for dissemination to researchers enquiring about the process of undertaking a new study. Cyprus/Greece Research projects conducted from April 2002 toDecember 2004 by the Cyprus/Greece Paediatric Surveillance Unit included W est syndrome, Kawasaki disease, pertussis, pancytopenia and vitamin D deficiency rickets. Germany Vaccine failures related to the use of Hib vaccinesin the Netherlands and in UK reported in 1993 caused a lot of concern regarding the efficacy of Hib vaccines, particularly when given in combination with DTPa. Combined vaccines have been used in Germany since 1996, and ESPED data demonstrated a constantly low rate of infections. Most of the cases were in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children. A recent publication has demonstrated an excellent long-term efficacy of tetra- and pentavalent combination vaccines, including Hib, in Germany (Kalies H, Verstraeten T , Grote V influenzae type b combination vaccines in Germany. Pediatr Infect Dis J 23 [2004]944-50).66C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Ireland Preliminary 2003 data of the study on alcohol and children identified 59 children who presented to hospital with events relating to alcohol ingestion. The median age was 14 years, 60% were female and88% required admission. Spirits (72%) and beer (22%) were the most common drinks taken. Alcohol levels were alarmingly high with a meanof 216 and a range of 112 to 380 mg per dL. This study highlighted the importance of alcohol in adolescence. It also demonstrated the relativelypoor IPSU returns at 75% and even lower completion of validation questionnaire. More intensive surveillance in one area suggested thatthe problem was much greater than our figures would suggest. Alcohol experimentation and excessive ingestion among adolescents meritgreater paediatric scrutiny. Latvia Latvia continues active surveillance in the areas of haematology/oncology, endocrinology, nephrology and HIV/AIDS. Malaysia Established in December 1993, the Malaysian Paediatric Surveillance Unit began surveillance in September 1994 reaching around 400 paediatriciansand surgeons. Initially there were four conditions under surveillance: paediatric HIV/AIDS, neonatal meningitis, muscular dystrophy was added in 1998 and neonatal congenital heart disease in 1999. Netherlands The surveillance study on Down syndrome aimed to measure quality of life aspects and use of Down syndrome teams. There were 222 and 189 reported cases in 2003 and 2004 respectively. Age at diagnosis was 1.8 days when born in hospital (71.5%) compared to 16.1 days when born at home (28.5%). After birth, hospital admissionfor diagnosis and treatment occurred in 84.6% of cases, most often unnecessarily. The mean age of the mothers was 33.5 years. Paediatricians (83%) used the Down protocol of the Dutch paediatric association. One or more cardiac defects were found in 54.6% of reported children and 40% had audiology screening, 34% of these were positive. A follow-up study is planned. New Zealand The national study of bronchiectasis in children less than 15 years of age found the incidence to be 3.7 per 100,000, over seven times higher than the only other national study undertaken in Finland.This means bronchiectasis is nearly twice the incidence of cystic fibrosis. The disease occurred unevenly among the childhood population. Inparticular, children of Pacific ethnicity had more than ten times the rate than children of European ethnicity. While the mean age of diagnosis wasfive years, most had had symptoms for more thantwo years by the time they were diagnosed. The importance of this study is that it clearly illustrates the significant presence of what is often a preventable childhood condition that can have sequelae throughout life. There is a need for greater vigilance for its early manifestations, so the diagnosis is made and appropriate care can be initiated. Portugal Early results of a four-year study on group Bstreptococcal neonatal infection (<90 days of age) conducted by the Portuguese Paediatric Surveillance Unit led to new guidelines by the General Health Directorate that now recommends universal screening of all pregnant women in their third trimester. Further study results have already shown a significant decline in the incidence of this condition during the last year of surveillance. The unit concluded surveillance of this condition in March 2005.67C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Switzerland Between March 2000 and February 2003, the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) study documented 60 confirmed cases. Reports from SPSU have been periodically compared and completed with notifications from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. The results represent the data from both sources. The clinical picture is shown in T able 43. The incidence of hospitalizations for children 6-15 years of age is equal to that of adults. TBE is rare inchildren less than six years of age. It is not clear if this is due to reduced exposure or to reduced risk of disease after exposure in this age group. These results nonetheless give support to the current immunization recommendations in Switzerland where in most cases vaccination against TBE is not indicated in children less than six years of age. Trinidad and Tobago The T rinidad and T obago Paediatric Surveillance Unit is currently seeking funding and once surveillance commences in 2005, a study on thevertical transmission of HIV/AIDS will be considered. The unit will provide reliable and useful information on important childhooddisorders, thereby facilitating child health-care delivery systems. Moreover, it is expected that this unit shall help graduate students as well asother investigators to conduct relevant clinical epidemiological research.Tick-borne encephalitis studyTABLE 43 Clinical picture moderate severeNumber (%) 60 (100)22 (37) 6 (27) 38 (63) 6 (16) 18 (47) 20 (53) 0 25 (66) 8 (21) 2 (5)3 (8) 68C P S P 2 0 0 4 R E S U L T S Call for New Studies Research opportunities Wanted Investigators to initiate new CPSP studies on childhood disorders that are high in disability, morbidity, mortality and economic costs to society, despite their low frequency. The paediatric community to take up the challenge of proposing a wide range of research studies. Interested individuals prepared to assume a leadership role in developing protocols and analyzing study data. The tool The CPSP is: A well-established, timely, cost-effective surveillance infrastructure. A multi-faceted surveillance tool capable of collecting reliable data in a variety of different fields. An effective means of monitoring low-frequency, high-impact diseases and conditions. Track record An 82% overall initial response from more than 2,400 paediatricians. An impressive 96% data completion rate for the 608 cases reported in 2004. High duplicate reporting rate (16.8%) assuring case ascertainment and participant commitment. International flavour Be part of INoPSU (International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units) a growing network of national paediatric surveillance units that exists in 13 countries around the world. T ake advantage of international collaboration, as INoPSU studies provide a remarkable opportunity to compare similar data and learn more about rare diseases worldwide. Looking for ideas? Here are a few examples of studies suggested through the program evaluation survey: Biliary atresia Brachial plexus injury Bronchiectasis Childhood tuberculosis Circumcision complications Complementary and alternative medicine Complications of body piercing Congenital parvovirus B19 zoster in children Histiocytosis disorders Imported malaria Invasive Group in obesity-related diabetes Kawasaki disease Severe hypernatremia Severe iron deficiency in preschoolers Sudden death in asthma T ype 1 diabetes The potential for new studies in different paediatric subspecialties is endless.
