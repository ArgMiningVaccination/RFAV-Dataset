However, maintaining a healthy body is easier said than done. One important but often overlooked element of health is how you fuel your body. With the right fuel, you can keep climbing mountains, running races, caring for our loved ones, and doing everything you dream of doing. You've probably used vitamins or supplements in the hopes of making sure your body has everything it needs to be healthy. Maybe you've thought to yourself, I should eat more fruits and vegetables. You've likely also tried refraining from eating or drinking certain things in order to be healthier. This is because what you put into your body has a huge daily impact on how you look, feel, think, and even act. Rethinking Your Health The human body can do incredible things. It can carry you to high mountaintops, let you swim in deep oceans, run marathons, play catch with your kids, and so much more. Introduction As more research is conducted about the power of natural products, we know we can care for ourselves using what nature has given us. One of the most precious gifts that Mother Nature has given us is essential oils. There's a long history of safe internal usage, and when used correctly, essential oils allow you to harness the power of nature to care for yourself and own your health. Essential oils are found in many foods you eat every day, so you've probably consumed them before without even knowing it. With a strong, healthy body, you have endless opportunities to live the happy, full life you want.Internal Use of Essential Oils3 For instance, if you take a peppermint leaf and crush it between your fingers, you'll instantly smell the minty aroma of peppermint. That's because a small amount of essential oil was released. Or say you're in the kitchen zesting a lemon. As you grate the lemon peel, microscopic particles of essential oil are released, and you smell the lovely scent of the lemon. And when you add that lemon zest or peppermint leaf to a recipe, you're consuming those tiny amounts of essential oil. Just as healthy foods and natural products can help you feel your best, things like toxins and processed foods can have the opposite effect. So the more you pay attention to what you're putting in your body, the better you feel. How can using essential oils internally contribute to fueling the body? When used safely, the natural, potent power of essential oils can help you feel whole, balanced, and strong. You'll find that internal uses for essential oils are as unique as you are, allowing you to give your body support as you work toward a healthy lifestyle. In this eBook, you'll learn why people love to use essential oils internally, how internal use began, how to be safe when using natural products internally, and best internal uses to help you enjoy these gifts of the earthInternal Use of Essential Oils4 Why Use Essential Oils Internally? When it comes to caring for your body, you have seemingly countless products on the market you can use as tools for better health. So why use essential oils?Chapter one With so many different essential oils at your disposal, you can tailor them to your specific wants and needs rather than be forced to settle for a generic solution, making essential oils a widespread choice for those looking for the best natural solutions in the modern era. The versatility of essential oils is part of what has made them so popular in recent years. People love that they can use essential oils for a variety of tasks, without having to buy multiple products. Some essential oils are soothing, toning, and grounding while others are energizing, warming, and renewing. The variety of essential oils available allow you to naturally and effectively address your specific concerns. Everyone has his or her own reasons for using essential oils. They've become a common alternative solution because they can be tailored to fit preferences and needs and are\u2014when sourced correctly\u2014natural. Because you have so many different essential oils to choose from, even The variety of essential oils available allow you to naturally and effectively address your specific concerns.Internal Use of Essential Oils5 those with specific health concerns and sensitivities can enjoy the benefits that essential oils have to offer. When you want to experience the powerful aromas of essential oils, aromatic use provides a quick and easy way to get the benefits you want. When you want to soothe, moisturize, nourish, or soften your skin, topical use of essential oils can get the job done. What then is the advantage of using essential oils internally? While internal use of essential oils is a mystery to some, research has found plenty of safe, beneficial uses for essential oils internally. Yes, aromatic and topical use provide a variety of benefits; however, internal use can be equally beneficial when done properly, and it even offers some exclusive benefits for the body that aromatic and topical use simply can't accomplish.Internal Use of Essential Oils6Is It Safe to Use Essential Oils Internally? You might be asking if it's really safe to use essential oils internally. If you've never used essential oils internally before, it might seem strange to consume something so powerful and potent. However, essential oils come from plants, fruits, and compounds found in nature and therefore present a safe way to receive internal benefits. You most likely already have essential oils in your daily diet because, like we talked about, many of the foods you eat contain small amounts of essential oil. Because your body is designed to metabolize and process natural compounds like plants and fruit, you're already equipped to metabolize essential oils. Essential oils are merely high concentrations of natural compounds\u2014the part that gives plants their taste and smell. Just as there are some plants that you shouldn't consume, some essential oils are never appropriate for internal use. However, plenty of them can be safely taken internally and processed by the body, much like other substances found in nature. As you'll read in Chapter 2, a long history of safe internal use exists that supports the validity of safely using essential oils internally. And in Chapter 3, we'll talk about the best practices for using essential oils internally. The Benefits of Internal Use A common reason for ingesting essential oils is to reap the internal benefits they hold for the body. Each essential oil possesses a different chemical structure that provide the body with unique properties and benefits. For example, some essential oils can be taken internally, promoting healthy cell function, supporting gastrointestinal health, or maintaining healthy immune function, while others may offer internal cleansing benefits.* When used properly internally, essential oils hold a wide array of wellness benefits. Along with substantial health benefits, internal usage also provides a way to add safe, natural, and tasty flavors to food and beverages. Not only will the addition of essential oils to entr\u00e9es, drinks, snacks, and baked goods provide a simple way to experience the health benefits of essential oils, it'll also add a pop of flavor to anything edible. Plus, essential oils are potent and powerful, so you'll only need a little to get the job done. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Internal Use of Essential Oils7As mentioned, you already consume small amounts of essential oils in your daily diet, so your body is equipped to process these types of nutrients. Like other things you consume, essential oils are processed through your body when ingested, providing the body with specific benefits. When an essential oil is taken into the body, the molecules are commonly transported through the gastrointestinal tract directly into the bloodstream, where they're carried throughout. As lipid-soluble compounds, essential oils can be transported to all the body's organs, even the brain. Because essential oils can be delivered to the organs, they're processed (like other things you consume) through metabolism by the liver and other organs, and finally excreted.The Science Behind Internal Use While your body is meant to metabolize and process natural compounds like those in essential oils, remember that it can only handle them in appropriate doses. You'll learn about appropriate dosage later, but know that when using essential oils internally, always consider dosage and consumption levels on a product-to-product basis. Each essential oil contains different chemical components that cause unique reactions within the organs and cells of the body. By considering chemistry and recommended dosage for each essential oil, it's possible to safely reap the benefits of internal usage. Internal Use of Essential Oils8History of Internal Use The use of plants and plant extracts dates back to almost every ancient civilization in the world. While some think essential oils are a new trend, we know that using plants to promote healthy bodies is a time-honored tradition that's been a part of most societies for centuries.Chapter two For example, a Chinese legend tells of a man named Shennong, who was an emperor and teacher. Tales say Shennong understood the effects of plants because he had a transparent body, which allowed him to ingest different herbs and \"see\" how they affected his body. But he also left behind texts that described his research on hundreds of different types of plants. Protocols based on his works have been passed down through generations and still influence modern healthcare to this day. Similarly, other ancient cultures believed in the power of ingesting plants or plant parts to aid the body. In medieval Persia (modern-day Iran), resins and spices were traded regularly and used widely to maintain health. You may have heard of the famous Persian doctor known as Avicenna. He researched and wrote extensively on health and wellness and how the natural elements of the earth can be used to benefit the body. Because of his extensive studies, he's often referred to as the father of early modern medicine. We now have the technology available to take plants from around the world and use them to create the purest essential oils in history.Internal Use of Essential Oils9Since the times of Shennong and Avicenna, the idea and definition of an essential oil has changed drastically. We now have the technology available to take plants from around the world and use them to create the purest essential oils in history. Essential oils as we know them today\u2014pure plant extracts taken from nature, distilled, tested, and placed in bottles for personal use\u2014also have a long history of safe internal use. While many have debated the internal usage of these gifts of the earth for years, the practice is validated time and time again through research and studies. Not only do researchers continue to confirm the safety of them internally, but with more research available, essential oils are becoming even more accessible, and it's easier to stay within the parameters of safe use. In the next chapter, we'll talk about important safety guidelines for internal use.When used safely, essential oils can provide the body with dozens of wonderful benefits and can contribute to a healthy, wholesome lifestyle.Internal Use of Essential Oils10Safety Guidelines for Internal Use When it comes to safely using essential oils internally, there's a lot to consider. Most importantly, you must remember that not all essential oils are created equal. Each essential oil has its own chemical makeup, set of benefits, and unique reactions with the body. Chapter three Also, not all essential oils are created equal because harvesting, production, and testing vary from distributor to distributor. This means that while some essential oils are pure and thoroughly tested, others include fillers, preservatives, or impurities that lower their quality and make them unsafe for internal use. It's important to remember not all essential oils are recommended for internal usage.Always verify the essential oils you're using are free of contaminants and impurities in order to protect your body from harm. While dTERRA\u00ae uses both internal and third-party testing and analytics to confirm each bottle of essential oil meets the highest standards of purity and efficacy, this isn't the case for all essential oil distributors. By using only thoroughly tested, truly pure essential oils, you can safely and easily employ essential oils internally. Some essential oils should never be taken internally\u2014in any amount. Always check labels and instructions to ensure the essential oil is meant for internal use.Internal Use of Essential Oils11Appropriate Doses Consider your personal health history and situation before trying essential oils internally. Consult with your physician beforehand and discuss any concerns with them. Even after you've considered these factors, you'll still need to ingest essential oils in appropriate doses to ensure safety. Whether you're using essential oils aromatically, topically, or internally, proper dosage is the best way to maintain safe use and get the most out of your products. While the appropriate dose will vary from person to person based on health, age, size, and the essential oil itself, some general guidelines can help you stay within the parameters of safe use. When it comes to internal use, it's best to start with the smallest dose possible\u2014one to two drops. Increase from here as needed. (Again, this will depend on the age, size, and health of the individual, as well as the desired benefit he or she is trying to achieve.) At a certain point, however, increasing the dose won't add any benefit, and taking too much may be harmful for the body. It's better to take smaller doses and repeat every four to six hours as needed. Smaller daily doses are recommended when using an essential oil internally over an extended time, rather than isolated doses that are spread out. Internal Use of Essential Oils12 Strong Oils Each essential oil has a unique chemical makeup, which causes different reactions in the body as it's processed internally. Some are merely too strong to be taken directly in the mouth or on the tongue. These particular essential oils can be taken internally by adding two or three drops to a Veggie Cap, including one or two drops in a recipe, or placing one drop in at least four ounces of liquid. Cassia, Cinnamon Bark, Clove, Oregano, and Thyme are some of the \"strong oils\" and should be used cautiously because of their potency. Always check labels for directions on dilution.Internal Use of Essential Oils13 Here are a few ways you can add essential oils to water: Add a drop or two of Lemon essential oil to a glass of water for a refreshing flavor. If you're trying to drink less soda or sugary drinks, add Grapefruit essential oil to your water for powerful flavor. Add invigorating essential oils like Peppermint or Wild Orange to water in the morning to give yourself a refreshing jumpstart. Add a drop of Cinnamon Bark essential oil with honey to hot water and sip slowly to soothe the throat.* Place a drop of Lime essential oil in a glass of water for enhanced flavor and immune support.* Combine Peppermint and Lemon essential oils in your water glass and drink to freshen the breath.What to Know about Essential Oil Sensitivity Sensitivity to an essential oil involves internal responses in the digestive and respiratory systems and topically on the skin. Some of the signs of essential oil sensitivity include pain, swelling, skin tenderness or irritation, difficulty breathing, and stomach upset. How to Handle Essential Oil Sensitivity If you develop a sensitivity to an essential oil, you can easily manage your application to avoid sensitivity or discomfort. As sensitivity to an essential oil isn't the same as an allergic reaction, you may still be able to use that essential oil but in a different method of application. For example, if you experience sensitivity after using an essential oil internally, you may still be able to use it aromatically or topically. Essential oil sensitivity can also be caused by incorrect dosage. If you've experienced sensitivity with a particular essential oil in the past, you can try diluting it or simply take a smaller dose to see if the sensitivity was caused by a high dosage. If you ever experience a sensitivity reaction to essential oils digestively, immediately discontinue use of that essential oil. If a large amount was consumed, contact Poison Control immediately. If it was only a small amount, you can help subside the sensitivity by drinking plenty of fluids. If the reaction becomes prolonged or severe, it's always wise\u2014and recommended\u2014to seek medical attention.If you develop a sensitivity to an essential oil, you can easily manage your application to avoid sensitivity or discomfort.Internal Use of Essential Oils14 Toxicity Essential oils are safe to use internally, provided the appropriate dosage is observed. In the most extreme cases, exceeding dosage recommendations can lead to toxicity. Toxicity is when a substance reaches a point that it becomes harmful or damaging to the body. Any substance (even natural, seemingly harmless ones) can become toxic if used in inappropriate amounts. Though essential oils have a potential for toxicity when used incorrectly (just like with water, minerals, vitamins, and other substances), the toxic dose of an essential oil is always well above the recommended dosage. A person would have to far exceed the dosage recommendations for an essential oil to put himself or herself in the dangerous range of toxicity. Now that you have a better understanding of how to stay safe when using essential oils internally, let's talk about best internal uses to help you experience the full benefits of your essential oils!Internal Use of Essential Oils15How to Use Essential Oils Internally A world of possibilities awaits you in the realm of internal usage of essential oils. Like we talked about, some benefits from using essential oils internally genuinely can't be provided aromatically or topically. When used safely and responsibly, essential oils offer countless benefits that will help you build the healthy lifestyle you want.

Keep in mind that essential oils are extremely potent, so even one drop on or under the tongue will be powerful. For essential oils that are too powerful to take directly, dilute a drop in at least four ounces of water before swallowing. Remember, strong oils like Cassia, Cinnamon Bark, Clove, Oregano, and Thyme should always be diluted. Softgels and Vegetable Capsules For those who'd rather not place essential oils directly in their mouth, softgels and vegetable capsules are useful options. To reap the internal benefits of an essential oil, simply place the desired (and appropriate) number of drops in an empty capsule, close, and swallow. Using a vegetable capsule that dissolves quickly is a simple way to customize your internal essential oil use. In addition to vegetable capsules, you might consider softgels or premixed capsules as ways to consume essential oils internally. dTERRA\u00ae offers softgels for many popular products like dTERRA On Guard+, Peppermint, DigestZen\u00ae, Copaiba, and more. Essential oils are extremely potent, so even one drop on or under the tongue will be powerful.Internal Use of Essential Oils20Here are a few specific (and delicious) ways you can use essential oils for cooking: Add Basil essential oil to your favorite Italian dishes for a refreshing flavor. Place a few drops of Bergamot essential oil in your regular tea to create Earl Grey. Add Cilantro essential oil to salads, dips, marinades, and stir-fry for flavor. Add Ginger essential oil to your favorite sweet and savory dishes. Use a few drops of Lemon essential oil in beverages, baked goods, or vegetables for a fresh, lemony flavor. Place a few drops of Peppermint essential oil in your morning smoothie for a refreshing twist.Adding essential oils to your favorite dishes and baked goods is a wonderful way to experience their flavor- enhancing benefits, not to mention their benefits for the body. The smallest amount of essential oil can enhance the flavor of entr\u00e9es, beverages, desserts, marinades, or any other dish that could use complimentary flavors. For centuries, essential oils have been used to add extra taste to meals because of their potent nature and ability to enhance natural flavors. When cooking with essential oils, remember that a little goes a long way. Because they're so concentrated, even the tiniest drop can provide a serious boost of flavor. When cooking with essential oils, rather than adding a drop to your dish, dip a toothpick in the bottle to extract flavor and stir the dipped toothpick in with the other ingredients. You can always add more, but including too much essential oil can overpower and even ruin a dish. It may take some experimentation, but as you start using essential oils to flavor and enhance your food, you'll soon experience the benefits that these natural extracts have to offer and will enjoy your favorite recipes even more.Cooking and Baking Internal Use of Essential Oils21 You've learned the basics of using essential oils internally.
