Made with clean, all-natural ingredients and ready in under 10 minutes, this natural deodorant recipe will quickly become a staple in your body routine. I am officially THAT girl. I mean we all knew the day would come. The signs were all there. [Natural beauty routine](https://www.thehealthymaven.com/2015/06/9-natural-diy-bath-and-beauty-recipes.html), apple cider vinegar EVERYWHERE, so it was due time I embrace my inner hippie and jump into the world of Natural Deodorant. Two years ago if you asked me if I would ever use natural deodorant I would have without a doubt laughed in your face. I'm judgmental like that. But now here I am, not only admitting to using it but also encouraging you to do the same. Oh how times have changed. I pretty much summed up my thoughts on natural beauty in [this post](https://www.thehealthymaven.com/2015/05/why-i-switched-to-a-natural-skin-care-routine-and-some-of-my-favorite-products-a-giveaway.html) and also shared some of my favourite homemade products in [this post](https://www.thehealthymaven.com/2015/06/9-natural-diy-bath-and-beauty-recipes.html) but in a nutshell I truly believe that what we put on our body should be equally as important as what we put in it. And this includes homemade deodorant. Why Use Natural Deodorant Have you seen what is in conventional deodorant? Likely you've glanced at the bottom at least once in your life and seen a list of ingredients that appear to be written in a different language. But did you know that many of these ingredients can be incredibly harmful for your body? Let's go through a couple of them: -aluminum: this is the ingredient that clogs your sweat glands and prevents sweating (more on this below). Aluminum exposure has been linked to Alzheimers as well as to build-up of estrogen in the body which can also be correlated with increased chances of breast and prostate cancer. -parabens: these ingredients are used as a preservative in deodorants but can also mimic estrogen in your body. This leads to hormonal disruptions and is also linked to breast and prostate cancers. -phthalates: these chemicals are used to make other ingredients more flexible and are also used as fragrance ingredients. They primarily affect the endocrine system and exposure can lead to early onset puberty as well as breast cancer later in life. -Triclosan: An antibacterial chemical that can also disrupt the hormone system and is associated with increased chance of breast cancer. It was actually banned by the FDA in hand soaps but for some reason they still allow it in deodorants?! ...this list could go on but this is just a taste of what you find in conventional deodorants. What You Need to Make DIY Deodorant: [Unrefined coconut oi](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CPZPYLS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00CPZPYLS&linkCode=as2&tag=theheamav04-20&linkId=ROM46KR22XZKRSGW) [l](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CPZPYLS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00CPZPYLS&linkCode=as2&tag=theheamav04-20&linkId=ROM46KR22XZKRSGW)- Coconut oil contains fatty acids, like lauric acid, which are known for their antibacterial benefits. It can help reduce the odor-causing bacteria in your arm pits, leaving you refreshed and smelling clean. [Unrefined shea butter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009MHJE4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0009MHJE4&linkCode=as2&tag=theheamav04-20&linkId=MWHO6RKLOI5WV35C)- Also super antibacterial and non-comedogenic so it won't clog your pours. It also adds moisture to the formula. [Arrowroot powder/flour](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FTCE63G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FTCE63G&linkCode=as2&tag=theheamav04-20&linkId=LWNFKNFEH4DW3H4Q)- A highly absorbent powder to help wick up extra sweat. Effectively acts as an antiperspirant. You can replace with tapioca starch if that's all you can find. [Baking soda](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CVY459K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00CVY459K&linkCode=as2&tag=theheamav04-20&linkId=VRP5DVNTOAWVKMKQ)-super effective at fighting body odor and also soaks up sweat. Note: baking soda can be a potential skin irritant so feel free to add less to the formula and work your way up. [Lavender essential oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DJ6J0C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001DJ6J0C&linkCode=as2&tag=theheamav04-20&linkId=3QUFH36PAD23UH4H)- this is primarily for scent so you can replace with a different essential oil if you prefer or omit for unscented. [Grapefruit essential oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014AWMOW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0014AWMOW&linkCode=as2&tag=theheamav04-20&linkId=YFU4BGVEY6N45GNV)- same as lavender in that you can replace with a different essential oil if you prefer a different scent or omit for fragrance free. [Tea tree essential oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1VWA2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000E1VWA2&linkCode=as2&tag=theheamav04-20&linkId=DD5CKDYXYEOZUNZC)(optional)* - tea tree is antibacterial and a super effective odor-buster. You will also need either a [small glass jar](https://amzn.to/3gLS5Ig) with a lid or [empty deodorant sticks](https://amzn.to/3RSCxjW) or containers. *Certain people are sensitive to tea tree oil so be sure to test your skin with a drop before adding to mixture. It is not necessary to include but tea tree is antibacterial and it is the bacteria in your underarms that leads to smell so it is a nice addition if you are not sensitive. How to Make DIY Deodorant STEP 1: Place coconut oil and shea butter in a glass bowl or jar and place the bowl/jar inside a medium sauce pan to create a double boiler. Add water to the saucepan (enough to surround bowl/jar but not to overflow it) and bring to a boil. As water is heating up, stir coconut oil and shea butter and continue to do so until it melts. STEP 2: Once melted, add in arrowroot starch, baking soda and essential oils. STEP 3: Place in a 3 ounce jar and allow to cool at room temp or in fridge (will harden faster in fridge) until it's reached a solid state. Cover with lid until use. How to Use DIY Deodorant: - Wet underarms slightly (this helps with even application) - Spoon out a pea-sized amount with a wooden scoop or with fingers and rub between fingers before applying directly to underarms. - For a regular day, one application in the morning should be fine. For hotter days, workouts or if you're particularly sweaty, feel free to reapply as needed. FAQs: Your Questions Answered How long does this natural deodorant last? If kept in a cool, dry place this natural deodorant will last 6-12 months. How much natural deodorant should I use? Just a pea-sized amount. A little goes a long way. Will I need to reapply? Depending on your body and level of activity you may have to. This natural deodorant is not an anti-perspirant so while it can reduce sweat slightly it will not prevent sweating entirely so you will need to reapply from time to time. Do I need an adjustment period to natural deodorant? Your armpits may require an adjustment period while making the switch. Start by using this DIY Natural Deodorant 1-2 days a week and slowly increase. What if my skin reacts to natural deodorant? Some people are sensitive to tea tree and baking soda. I recommend waiting at least 6 hours after you shave if you plan to use this natural deodorant. This means I'll shave the night before and then apply the next morning. This prevents any kind of skin reactivity. If you have extra sensitive skin you can leave out the tea tree and decrease the amount of baking soda in the blend. Help! My DIY Deodorant won't harden! First things first, try putting it in the fridge. If it hardens in the fridge then it's likely your home is on the warmer side and you'll need to store it in the fridge to keep it solid. It works if it isn't solid but may separate a bit. Alternatively, check to make sure you didn't use fractionated coconut oil which will not harden. You'll need to remake your recipe with non-fractionated coconut oil. How long will this natural deodorant last? Mine typically lasts 3-6 months depending on the season and how frequently I'm reapplying. What about store-bought deodorants?
