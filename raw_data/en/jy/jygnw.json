By working with the individual constitution of the body: congestive (mucor), inflammatory (penicillic) and degenerative (aspergillic) to address the multicausality: toxins, food sensitivities, deficiencies, hyperacidity, hyperproteinisation. Biological medicine is an advanced dynamic thinking in medicine that is based on detoxification, regeneration and building up of the intestinal health bacteria. It is based on the thinking of Dr. Enderlein concept of pleomorphism and symbiotic human being bacteria. The 5 main categories of biological medicine are: isopathics, immune biological remedies, organic acids, haptenes, milieu therapeutics. Natural nutrition is one main factor for healing, detoxification and rebuilding the organs. The most important in the metabolic function is the inner milieu that regulates the balance. To lower the pathogenicity of the germs isopathics are used instead of antibiotics. Dr. Rau uses homeopathic medicine with great results at as: Notakehl, produced by The tests in Biological medicine are: Darkfield Microscopy, Heart Rate Variability, Regulation Thermography. The first steps of detox includes elimination of allergens (gluten, dairy.) Second step, is the intestinal flora rebuilding through alkalinization, essential amino acids, orthomolecular therapy, organ cell extracts, organ acids (Pleo Sanuvis). Balancing sympathetic with parasympathetic system creates the environment for healing. Some of examples of the dysbalance of autonomous system are: IBS, hypersentivitiy, super ventricular arrhythmia, chronic fatigue, sleep disorder etc. In my practice at Magnolia Personalized Medicine PC, the principles of biological medicine are employed through the detoxification, rebuilding the organs according to each constitution type, balancing the sympathetic with parasympathetic system, and addressing the pleomorphism of human gut bacteria. By using the vital principles of homeopathy, orthomolecular therapy, phytotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine we create the milieu for healing. With our homeopathic injections we address: muscle stiffness, sleep disorders, mild depression, restlessness, sciatic pain, trigeminal neuralgia, liver and biliary disorders, lymphatic edema and more.
