Greenberg*, Donald Malone, Wayne Goodman, Herbert Ward, Michael Okun, Kelly Foote, Andre Machado, Gerhard Friehs, Ali Rezai, Nicole McLaughlin, Paul Malloy, Cynthia Kubu, StevenRasmussen Butler Hospital, Providence, RI, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, Mt. Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY, University of Florida, Gainesville,FL, Scott and White Hospital, Temple, TX, Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, Butler Hospital/Brown University, Providence, RI Background: disorder (OCD) has been studiedsince 2001 in the US. The FDA approved this therapy for humanitarian use in 2009 on the basis of open-label pilot data. Although 3 year followup data have been reported, longer-term outcomes are important1) clinically in balancing risks, benefits, and burdens of this intensivetreatment, and 2) for understanding behavioral phenotypes and associated neurocircuit effects related to benefit. Methods: Pilot patients from three US centers (Butler Hospital/Brown Univ., Cleveland Clinic, Univ. Florida, N \u00bc16) were followed long- itudinally between three and eight years post implantation. Results: Presurgical Yale-Brown OCD Scale (YBOCS) severity was 34.4\u00b10.6 (SEM, range 31-40), indicating severe illness in a population selected for surgery only after failure of aggressive behavioral treatment and medication trials. Mean YBOCS severity at 1 year was 22.4\u00b12.3 (range 3-30), and remained essentially unchanged on a group basis thereafter: year four, mean YBOCS \u00bc22.1\u00b11.4 (range 14-33), year means during long-term DBS (3-8 years) ranged from 11 to 31. Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores were 37.1 \u00b11.6 at baseline, consistent with severe impairment. GAF scores improved to a mean range of 52-59 over years one to seven. During followup, patients received continued pharmacotherapy and behavior therapy, although thenumber of medications prescribed decreased by one to two onaverage vs. persurgical baseline in patients who improved. Adverse events related to surgery infection, hemorrhage, a single seizure) had resolved by months after implantation. Mood, anxiety, andOCD symptoms worsened mildly, moderately, or severely when DBSwas interrupted throughout chronic stimulation. Two of 16 patients died during followup of unrelated medical causes (in years one and eight). An additional 5/16 were not receiving continuous ongoingstimulation for reasons including suboptimal responses and/or barriers to receiving device replacements over time. Patients whose main OCD-related impairment were due to symptoms involving''incompleteness'' (aimed at attaining a feeling that actions or theenvironment were ''right'') improved less overall than individuals whose symptoms focused on harm avoidance. But at least one incompleteness patient was a full responder (35% + decrease in YBOCSseverity).Discussion: Therapeutic effects DBS targeting a fronto-basal brain network implicated in OCD and related disorders appear sustained over years of continuing stimulation. Average severity changed fromvery severe to moderate, paralleled by improved functioning. However,about one-third of patients no longer received DBS three + years after implantation. Patients with symptoms based in avoidance of harmseemed to benefit most, suggesting that behavioral phenotypes related to fear and avoidance are important in the therapeutic response. These hypotheses are a focus of ongoing translationalresearch by ourselves and collaborators. More long-term data are essential to optimizing patient selection. Some will be obtained in an ongoing NIMH-supported controlled trial of DBS for OCD. Anessential role would be played by creation of a data registry for patientcharacteristics and outcomes, as suggested by investigators in the field and by NIMH. Disclosure: B.D. 3; Medtronic, Inc. Deep Brain Stimulation for OCD: Now Different Cortical Bundles Really Get to Their Targets Suzanne Haber* University of Rochester Rochester, NY Background: Dysfunction of the ventral prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and (OFC), strongly associated pathophysiology of OCD and part of the cortico-basal (VC/VS) targets this network. Each electrode has 4 contact sites spaced strategically to potentially involve different nodal points within the circuit. The goal of these experiments was to: 1.Determine organizational rules that govern the trajectory of ventralPFC efferent fiber bundles; 2. Determine which bundles are affected by DBS at each contact; and 3. Develop an electric field neurostimulation model around representative targets to determine likely volumes ofeffect for the commonly used clinical parameters. Methods: 3-D reconstructions of the vmPFC and OFC fiber bundles were created from conventional anatomical tracings following tracerinjections into the different prefrontal areas in primates. Humanelectrode representations were adjusted for size and imported into the primate 3-D model. Using neurostimulation modeling we visualized stimulus spread at the VC/VS site to determine how differentparameter alters the inclusion of fibers at each contact. All experimentswere conducted in accordance with the ILAR Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by The University Committee on Animal Resources.Results: Fibers from ventral prefrontal areas follow certain organiza- tional rules. The route taken by fibers from different ventral prefrontal regions through the capsule depends largely on their medial-laterallocation. Axons from medial regions remain in the most ventral parts,including the small fascicules embedded within the VS. In contrast, axons from lateral OFC areas travel more dorsal in the capsule. Within each group of fibers, those traveling to the brainstem are locatedventral to those traveling to the thalamus. Electrode placements showwhich fibers are captured at each contact. Changing the stimulation parameters may or may not capture additional fiber destinations, depending on the contact.Conclusions: These data illustrate the organization of each prefrontal cortical pathway through the internal capsule and the relationship between bundles arising from different cortical areas. Combining thefact that fibers traveling to the brainstem from each cortical area travelventral to those going to the thalamus from that same cortical area, with the overall medial to lateral topographic arrangement of cortical fibers within the capsule, demonstrates a complex set of fibersassociated each contact. Taken together these data show that eachcontact captures a different combination of brainstem and thalamic fibers from diverse prefrontal areas. This combination will vary according to the stimulation parameters used. These data also suggestthat brainstem fibers may be a critical feature to the effectiveness ofDBS for OCD. Disclosure: S.N.

Quirk*, Jose Rodriguez-Romaguera, ChristianBravo-Rivera, Fabricio H. M. Do Monte University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine, San Juan, PRBackground: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule/ ventral striatum is effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in refractory obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), but little is known about how DBS alleviates anxiety disorders. Persistentavoidance responses in OCD and other anxiety disorders may be dueto a failure of extinction to reduce conditioned fear reactions. We therefore used a rat model to study the effects of DSB-like stimulation of the ventral striatum on fear expression and extinction in an auditoryfear conditioning task. Following a recent study in anesthetized rats (McCraken and Grace, 2009), we targeted the nucleus accumbens core (Nac) with high frequency stimulation (130 Hz, HFS) similar to clinicalDBS, or a low frequency stimulation (10 Hz, LFS) control condition.Methods: On day 1, rats underwent fear conditioning by pairing tones (30 sec) with foot-shock, while pressing a bar for food. On day 2, rats received HFS, LFS, or no stimulation (NS) of the NAc 60 min prior toand during a 15 tone extinction session. On day 3, all rats were testedfor extinction recall in the absence of stimulation. To determine the effect of stimulation on fear circuits, another set of rats underwent HFS and LFS for 60 min and were sacrificed 45 m later and processed forimmunostaining for the plasticity marker pERK in cortico-amygdala circuits. Labeling in HFS and LFS groups was compared to a NS control.Results: HFS rats, but not LFS, showed a reduction in fear expression during extinction. On the next day, HFS rats showed strengthened extinction memory, converting an ineffective extinction session to an effective one. In contrast, LFS resulted in exaggerated fear at test.There was no effect of HFS or LFS on rates of spontaneous barpressing. HFS increased pERK-immunoreactivity in the amygdala intercalated cells and lateral division of the central nucleus (ITC/CeL), and area that exerts inhibitory control over amygdala output neuronsin the medial central nucleus (CeM). In contrast, LFS increased label in the CeM, but not the ITC/CeL. Discussion: The ability of HFS to reduce fear expression and strengthen extinction memory suggests that DBS may allow OCDpatients to benefit from extinction-based therapies, which failed prior to surgery. The pattern of pERK label we observed suggests that DBS strengthens extinction by inducing plasticity in inhibitory circuitswithin the amygdala, known to be involved in extinction memory.Further experiments are underway to determine if HFS in the absence of extinction training is sufficient to reduce fear expression.

Examining the Neural Circuitry of Conditioned Fear Extinction in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Using fMRI Mohammed Milad* Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MARecent mounting evidence gathered from human neuroimaging studies strongly supports the role of the medial prefrontal regions are dysfunctional in anxiety disorders, including OCD. Most neuroimaging studies that examined the role of these prefrontal regions have employed neurocognitive or symptom-provocation paradigms. Direct tests of the functional integrity of the OFC/vmPFC in OCD during fear extinction remain to be conducted. Examining the integrity of the extinction circuitry in OCD patients isclinically important because extinction forms the basis for exposuretherapy commonly used to treat anxiety disorders, including OCD. We began to fill this gap in the literature by examining the neural circuitryof fear extinction in OCD patients using fMRI and psychophysiological measures. OCD patients and matched healthy controls underwent a two-day fear conditioning and extinction protocol, previously deve- loped and validated. All participants underwent the experimentalprotocol while they are in an fMRI scanner. Skin conductance responsewas monitored throughout the experiment and was used as the behavioral index of conditioning. On Day 1, subjects received conditioning followed by extinction, using photographs of coloredlights as CSs. On day 2, extinction recall was assessed (test forextinction memory). Our preliminary data indicate that OCD patients showed intact fear acquisition and extinction training on day 1. On day 2, however, OCD patients showed exaggerated fear responses, indexedby SCR, suggesting impaired recall of the extinction (safety) memory.Functional MRI analysis shows failure to activate the vmPFC while OCD patients are recalling the extinction memory. These patterns of psychophysiological and brain dysfunctions observed in the OCDcohort examined herein resembles those recently reported in PTSD patients. Moreover, preliminary data from our collaborative team indicate that both acute and chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) inOCD patients result in increased resting metabolic activity in thevmPFC. Collectively, therefore, our data suggest that OCD patients appear to exhibit impaired extinction recall that is associated with failure to activate the vmPFC. Current ongoing studies are aimed toexamine the effects of DBS on rectifying the extinction deficits in OCD,which could provide a possible mechanism by which DBS could improve some of the clinical symptoms of OCD.

Panel Session Lost in Translation: Is It the Animal Models or Clinical TrialDesigns That Are Responsible for the High Failure Rate in CNS Drug Development? Increasing the Validity for Animal Tests of Depression by Genetic - Environment InteractionsIrwin Lucki*, Georgia E. Hodes, Gregory V. Carr University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PABackground: Concerns have been raised about the predictive and face validity of some of the rodent tests for depressive behavior thathave been used historically to measure the effects of antidepressant drugs. Behavioral tests for antidepressant activity have evolved from measuring drug responses in unperturbed ''normal'' animals toinclude genetic and environmental models of stress vulnerability andto include the need to examine chronic drug treatment. An overview, and specific examples from new research, will be presented on the use of specific strains of rats and mice to model the impairing effects ofexposure to stress, the restorative effects of antidepressant drugtreatment, and resistance to treatment with conventional antidepres- sants. Specific examples will be provided from new research. Methods: Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were tested for the effects of the SSRI fluoxetine and the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist DIPPA using the modified rat forced swim test (FST) and the novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test. Mice weretested for the behavioral effects of chronic treatment with fluoxetine ordesipramine in the NIH test. Hippocampal cell proliferation was measured by incorporation of BrdU and levels of BDNF protein were measured using ELISA.Results: WKY rats are a genetic model for exaggerated depression and anxiety behaviors. Despite resistance to the behavioral effects of SSRIs, WKY rats demonstrate a superior behavioral response to systemic administration of KOR antagonists in the forced swim test or novelty-induced hypophagia test. Inbred strains of mice also demonstratedramatic differences in the response to acute and chronic antidepres- sant drug treatments. MRL/MpJ mice, a model for superior cellularS2 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceregeneration after injury, demonstrate a greater change in hippo- campal neurogenesis, BDNF levels and behavioral responses to anti- depressant drug treatments than other strains of mice, such as C57BL/6J mice. The large responses of MRL/MpJ mice allowexploration of underlying mechanisms. Although the response ofC57BL/6J mice to antidepressants is smaller than other strains, these mice demonstrated robust increases in hippocampal neurogenesis, BDNF levels and respond behaviorally in the NIH test after exposure tostress induced by infusion of corticosterone or the chronic mild stressprocedure. Discussion: These studies illustrate ways that the face and predictive validity for antidepressant tests can be improved by using genetic andenvironmental interactions with stress. Genetic background andexposure to stress are major factors in determining the response of rodents to antidepressant drugs. These examples underscore the usefulness of considering these factors in drug discovery.Disclosure: I. Lucki, Wyeth, Part 1; Astra-Zeneca, Part 4. From New Drug to No Drug: Novel Mechanisms for Antidepressants in the Clinic David Michelson*, Duane Snavely, Richard Hargreaves Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., North Wales, PA, PA Candidate non-monoamine mechanisms to treat depression have generally disappointed hopes they could become therapeutics, even when effects in preclinical models have been demonstrated or initialclinical trials have been encouraging. As a result, despite continuing and considerable unmet medical need, the commitment within industry to drug discovery and development efforts for depressiveillness is waning, and is unlikely to return without an understanding ofwhy past efforts have failed, and how the probability of success can be improved going forward. One of the most disappointing failures of a putative treatment for depression was the NK-1 antagonist, which wasextensively studied preclinically and in exploratory and confirmatoryclinical trials, with the most comprehensive program involving the Merck drug candidate MK-0869. This program included 4 efficacy studies conducted as phase 2 exploratory trials, and 8 efficacy studiesconducted as phase 3 confirmatory trials (this includes several studiesstopped earlier than planned). In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the evidence that drove this development program forward, examine the translational strategies, and present analyses ofthe characteristics of the clinical studies at different phases of development, with specific attention to the type 1 statistical error early and loss of signal later to understand the lessons that can bedrawn from this experience and the implications for the design offuture antidepressant drug development programs.

Cross-Species Tests for Cognition Enhancement in Schizophrenia Mark Geyer*, Jared Young University of California, San Diego, La Jolla CABackground: The NIMH-funded MATRICS Program (Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia)developed a broad consensus regarding the nature of the cognitiveimpairments in schizophrenia and how they might best be assessed and treated. There is an urgent need for improved translational tools to facilitate preclinical drug discovery and associated clinical proof ofconcept studies relevant to developing new treatments for cognition in schizophrenia. Hence, this presentation will focus on how preclinical scientists can develop and refine animal tests to identify novel pro-cognitive agents having potential utility in the treatment ofantipsychotic-treated schizophrenia patients. For example, attention/ vigilance is commonly assessed in humans using the continuous performance test (CPT), which requires a response to signal events andan inhibition of response to non-signal events. Signal detection theory (SDT) is used to evaluate performance in the CPT. A recently developed rodent 5-choice (5C)-CPT requires both responses to target stimuli and the inhibition of responses to other stimuli, therebyenabling the use of SDT in assessing vigilance.Methods: Initial validation of the 5C-CPT as a test of vigilance in mice was examined by comparisons of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice in an extended session challenge (Exp. 1). Further validation of the5C-CPT was examined in dopamine receptor wildtype (WT)and heterozygous (HT) mice, using challenges with: variable stimulus duration (0.8, 1, and 2s; Exp. 2); and an extended inter- trial interval (ITI) session, with vehicle or the 5-HT2C antagonistSB242084 (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg) in a within subjects design (Exp. 3).Finally, the predictive validity of the 5C-CPT was assessed by assessing the effects of nicotine administration on vigilance in C57BL/6J mice (Exp. 4).Results: In experiment 1, C57BL/6J mice exhibited higher levels of vigilance than DBA/2J mice and a less pronounced vigilance decrement despite comparable levels of accuracy. In experiment 2, shorterstimulus durations degraded performance by increasing false alarmresponses and HT mice exhibited poorer vigilance performance. Here, no difference in premature responses was observed. In experiment 3, a 5-HT2C antagonist-induced increase in premature responses wasobserved, with no interaction or effect of genotype and no effect onfalse alarms. Finally in experiment 4 nicotine induced a significant improvement on performance of C57BL/6J mice, consistent with observations in humans.Discussion: In these studies in mice, the use of target and non- target stimuli in the 5C-CPT enabled the: a) use of SDT to assess vigilance; b) identification of a vigilance decrement over time intwo strains of mice; c) differentiation of impulsivity in response tonon-target stimuli (false alarms) and motor impulsivity (premature responses); and d) identification of nicotine-induced improvements in vigilance in normal performing animals. These effects are consis-tent with human studies using the CPT. Hence, these studiessuggest that the 5C-CPT enables vigilance testing in mice and is therefore available for use in efforts to develop and assess pro- cognitive compounds having efficacy that may translate from rodent tohuman CPT testing.

New Paths for Drug Development in Schizophrenia Michael Egan*, Lyn Harper Mozley, Regina Gottwald, Duane Snavely, Ying Zhang, Xin Zhao, David Michelson Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., North Wales, PA Background: Despite efforts to develop new treatments for schizo- phrenia, no drugs with a novel mechanism of action have been approved for decades. This failure may be related to target selection orexecution of clinical trials. An analysis of recent drug trials suggestsavenues that may increase the likelihood of developing effective, new drugs. Methods: Results of clinical trials of antipsychotic and cognition drugs were collected from published studies, reviews, abstracts, and pressreleases. Trials were evaluated in terms of: a) support from animal models, b) evidence for CNS target engagement, c) dose selection, d) study design. Because many cognition trials have not yet beenpublished, we also examine data from three recent, unpublishedcognition trials to assess methodological issues. These trials were conducted to assess the feasibility of running cognition trials and usedS3 an ORL1 antagonist. Limited, preliminary, preclinical data suggested cognitive benefits for all three. Approximately 50 patients per study participated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies using (BACS) t-score . Results: We identified 420 drug targets for psychosis and 10 for cognition tested over the last 30 years. Clinical trials showed a lack of efficacy for most mechanisms. Frequent problems with developmentpaths included lack of efficacy in animal models, no evidence of CNStarget engagement, unclear rationale for dose selection, poor power, lack of active comparator, and lack of replication. Recent trials that included approved antipsychotics also have shown lack of efficacy.Issues include high placebo response and concerns about PANSSratings and inclusion of inappropriate patients. Relapse prevention designs may be more robust than trials of acutely psychotic inpatients. Regarding cognition studies, none included an active comparator.Cognition trials may have some advantages, in contrast to acute psychosis, as deficits are more trait-like and cognition measures are more objective, but concerns about patient heterogeneity and targetselection remain challenges. Regarding three clinical trials of novelcompounds, trial execution appeared adequate but all failed to demonstrate efficacy (p 4.2). A practice effect was observed during placebo run in periods, suggesting changes in performance could bedetected. The results highlight several additional issues including 1)dose selection; 2) duration of treatment; 3) the possibility antipsychotics may block pro-cognitive effects. Discussion: Methodological refinements in clinical trial design and execution may improve the probability of success of future drug trails. More problematic are the paucity of validated drug targets. Preclinical cognition models in particular appear to be poor predictors of efficacyand markedly limit target validation efforts. The future of drugdevelopment may depend on identifying human biomarkers related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Similar efforts in other diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's) have been successful in stimulating drug develop-ment. Fledging attempts to identify clinically measurable, molecularabnormalities (e.g. reduce prefrontal D1 density) suggest this may be a viable path forward in schizophrenia. Disclosure: M.

Goldstein, None.Rare Variant Discovery in the Coding and Non-Coding Genome in Pervasive Developmental Disorders Matthew State* Yale University, New Haven, CTBackground: The recent flood of findings from genome wide association studies have confirmed the importance of common geneticpolymorphisms for neuropsychiatric syndromes. At the same timethey have underscored the surprisingly limited nature of this contribution as well as the need to consider the role of rare alleles. Next generation, massively parallel sequencing, for the first time,allows for unbiased genome wide identification of novel low frequencyalleles. However, these new approaches have revealed a tremendous amount of rare variation in the normal human genome, making the separation of ''signal'' from ''noise'' in the study of clinical disorders apressing challenge. This is particularly an issue for non-coding segments of the genome which are likely to be important for complex neuropsychiatric phenotypes, but where the functional consequencesof this variation may be extremely difficult to interpret. We have takenseveral approaches characterizing novel rare mutations genome-wide in the study of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) including: focusing on rare subsets of patients with extreme phenotypes, focusing onde novo variation among simplex families, and devising a strategy to study highly constrained non-coding sequences. Methods: We focus on two patient samples: 1) 9 families (N \u00bc17) with CDD, a very rare regressive ASD syndrome that displays apparentlysporadic inheritance. In this sample we have applied whole exome sequencing using Nimblegen liquid capture and the Illumina GAIIx 2) 30 trios (N \u00bc90) from the Simons Simplex Collection, which focuses on identifying simplex cases of autism. Forthis sample, we have devised a strategy to study the non-coding genome by focusing on the investigation of 15,000 highly conserved enhancers and empirically defined transcription factor binding sites.A custom Agilent array was used to capture these regions prior tosequencing. Both studies use whole blood derived DNA. Results: Sequencing is currently underway. New data will be presented highlighting specific functional variations with a focus on recurrentde novo mutations. Our preliminary data to date has confirmed the sensitivity and specificity of whole-exome sequencing for the detection ofde novo variation using solution based genomic partitioning and sequencing on the Illumina GAIIx instrument. We report a high falsepositive rate of de novo detection based on cell line derived DNA, demonstrating that value of whole blood DNA for these studies. Discussion: Massively parallel sequencing is providing unprecedented opportunities for gene discovery in neuropsychiatric disorders. Theidentification of large amounts of rare, apparently, neutral variation in the normal human genome complicates the analysis of rare variant data. Leveraging extreme outliers, de novo mutations, and data on evolutionary constraint are promising approaches to addressing thisproblems. Disclosure: M.W. State, None. Using NextGen Sequencing to Interrogate Human Brain Evolution Daniel H. Geschwind* UCLA Department of Neurology, Los Angeles, CA We have taken a multi-pronged approach to understanding the genetic basis of human higher cognition, including the assessment of gene expression differences between human and primate genes. The first generation of such studies involved microarray technology, but thesestudies, while illuminating, had several pitfalls including artifacts due to cross-species sequence differences. Next generation (NextGen) sequencing permits such analyses to be performed and to includeanalysis of splicing, all free from issues of hybridization, providing afar more complete view of evolutionary divergence in the brain transcriptome. We performed NextGen sequencing of hippocampus, cerebral cortex chimpanzee, and based library generation on the Illumina Genome Analyzer and compared this to Affymetrix and Illumina whole genome microarray platforms. We found several times as many human specific changesusing sequencing compared to microarrays using the rhesus macaquedata as outgroup data. These genes fell into specific pathways that we could identify using Gene Ontology Analysis. Furthermore, we were able to adapt Whole Genome Co-Expression Network Analysis(WGCNA), which we have used for microarray gene expression (e.g.Oldham et al. 2008 Nat Neurosci.), to NextGen sequencing data. Here we were able to significantly enriched modules of co-expressed genes within the networks that were unique to human brain. We furtherexpanded this initial study by performing RNA-seq, which providesmore depth and additional information on splicing and miRNAs, in the same individuals and additional brain regions. This comprehensive analysis has allowed us to directly compare the methodologies and todetermine expression and splicing differences between the species for the first time. These studies are the first of its kind to use sequencing to examine brain gene expression across multiple species. Additionally,these data provide important examples of the power of this emergingtechnology. Disclosure: D.H. Geschwind: None. High-Throughput DNA Sequencing in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) Christopher A. Walsh*, Tim Yu, Maria Chahrour, Christian Schubert,Sean Hill Harvard University, Boston, MAAlthough autism is among the most highly genetic of neuropsychiatric disorders, the precise genes that are causal are typically only knownin 15-20% of patients. An increasing amount of data suggests that autism can arise from an increasingly heterogeneous collection of rare mutations, including syndromic forms (e.g., Fragile X or MECP2 mutations), rare quasi-Mendelian forms ( NRXN1 ,SHANK3 variants (CNV's, e.g., 22q11 deletions, 16p11.12 deletions or duplications, and 15p11 duplications) andother, diverse CNV's. Our work has focused on identifying recessivemutations associated with autism, on the hypothesis that recessive mutations may underlie additional quasi-Mendelian forms of autism, but that recessive mutations may also interact in more 'complex' fashionin other autistic children. We have recruited more than 240 families withone or more children affected with autism ( 440 with 2 or more affected children) in which the two parents share common ancestry (typically as first cousins), focusing recruitment on countries where cousin marriageis conventional (including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Pakistan, etc.). Analysis of the first 78 families (Morrow et al, Science 2008) identified a lower incidence of large, de novo CNV's (1/78) compared to comparably analyzed children whose parents were unrelated, consistent with animportant role for recessive mutations in children with consanguineous parents. In contrast, 5/78 patients showed homozygous deletions of 18,000-321,000 bp of DNA, inherited through both parents from acommon ancestor. Surprisingly, only one of these homozygous deletionsremoved the coding portion of a gene, suggesting that removal of noncoding DNA near genes, including predicted transcription factor binding sequences, might causes some cases of autism. At least one gene(SCL9A9 ,a . k . a . NHE9 ) near a large deletion seen in a patient with autism with seizures also showed heterozygous point mutations in American children with autism and seizures. Linkage analysis of larger families with 2-4 affected children suggested that recessive genes are hetero-geneous, since different families showed linkage to diverse chromo- somes and loci. We have now developed methods to identify recessive, homozygous point mutations from areas of arrays followed by high-throughput Illumina sequen-cing. Initial analysis suggests that autistic children may have previously undescribed, ''hypomorphic'' mutations in genes previously associated with more severe Mendelian human disease, as well as mutations innovel genes not previously associated with disease.

Panel Session Oxidative Stress in Psychiatric forPathophysiology and Pharmacotherapy Novel Postmortem and in vivo Mitochondrial Association in Psychiatric Disorders Marquis P. Vawter*, Maureen V. Martin, Brandi Rollins, P. Guffanti, Macciardi University of California - Irvine, Irvine, CABackground: Alterations in expression of mitochondrial related genes are potential indicators of functional deficits and have emerged as acandidate pathway for bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ). Multiple genes in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation path- way are regulated by pH or strongly associated with pH regulation,thus disentangling cause and effect has been extremely difficult. Othershave found an association of mtDNA polymorphisms with amygdala volume and pH, decreased postmortem pH in BD and SZ, increased oxidative stress indicators in BD and SZ, and mtDNA copy numberalterations due to prolonged brain hypoxia. We studied mtDNApolymorphisms and association with brain pH and the common deletion of mtDNA in a postmortem study. In a separate in vivo study the mean blood oxygen level-dependent signal (BOLD) was measuredduring a cognitive task and differences between mtDNA allele groups were calculated. Methods: Postmortem pH quantitative trait association with mtDNA SNPs was run in PLINK with permutation to obtain empiricalp-values. The mtDNA common deletion (4,977 bp deletion) was measured by quantitative real time PCR assay (200 samples). Mean BOLD signal in regions of interest during the probe condition fora memory load of 3 items was compared to a memory load of 1 itemby mtDNA allele. Results: Three haplogroup association of pH withU-K-Uk SNPs was robust (p o4x1 0 upon bootstrap permutations. The U-K-Uk mtDNA haplogroup had a significantly higher pH (mean 7.06 \u00b10.18 SD) compared to the remaining haplogroup in European ancestry individuals (mean6.86\u00b10.18 SD). Postmortem interval (PMI) was not different between the U-K-Uk super haplogroup and the remaining haplogroups, and including PMI in ANCOVA did not reduce the significance of the pHdifferences between U-K-Uk super haplogroup and the remaininghaplogroups (p \u00bc0.0007 with PMI as a covariate). MtDNA common deletion varied by 50 fold between brain regions, with age showing the strongest effect (p o10 /C012). The caudate, putamen, substantia nigra and amygdala showed the highest average deletion rates. The BD group shows a significant increase in deletion of mtDNA of 4,977 bp in DLPFC. This deletion normally accumulates with age, and was notincreased in SZ subjects.Individuals within U-K-Uk haplogroupshowed lowest BOLD activation levels on the cognitive task compared with subjects not in this haplogroup in multiple prefrontal regions and cerebellum.Discussion: During hypoxia, individuals within the matrilineal haplogroup (U-K-Uk) maintain less acidification of brain pH compared to individuals in other haplogroups. This robust association was not altered by differences in PMI. In preliminary data analysis, thesame matrilineal haplogroup (U-K-Uk) SNP that relates to higherbrain pH was also associated to lower brain activation BOLD during a cognitive task. These results together might indicate decreasedS5 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencecoupling efficiency, such that alteration in pH could lead to lower brain activation as measured by the oxygen consumption while individuals with lower pH (more acidification) have higher use of molecular oxygen in brain. MtDNA stratification in other postmortemstudies and genome wide association studies are needed to determineif SNPs that relate to brain pH and activation differences in this study are replicated.

Terwilliger,Carrolee Barlow University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, BrainCells Inc., San Diego, CA Background: Human anxiety disorders are complex diseases with largely unknown etiology. We have taken a cross-species approach to identify genes that regulate anxiety-like behavior using inbred mousestrains that differ in their innate anxiety levels as a model.Methods: We carried out gene expression profiling of seven brain regions in 6 inbred mouse strains that differ in their innate anxiety levels to identify genes that regulate anxiety-like behavior. We thenverified these results by qPCR, enzyme activity assays, and lentivirus-mediated gene transfer. To test whether genetic variants in any of these genes predispose humans to anxiety disorders, we carried out an association analysis in an anxiety disorder study sample derived froma Finnish population-based Health 2000 Survey. It consists of 321patients and 653 carefully matched controls, all interviewed using CIDI to obtain DSM-IV diagnoses of panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, or phobia NOS.Results: In the mouse study, we identified 17 genes with expression levels that correlate with anxiety behavior across six inbred mouse strains in at least one of the studied brain regions. The role of twogenes, glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) and glutathione reductase 1 (Gsr), that areboth involved in the regulation of oxidative stress was studied in functional analyses. Overexpression and/or silencing of these genes in the cingulate cortex of the mouse altered the anxiety-like behavior ofthe mice in the open-field test, indicating that both Glo1 and Gsrregulate anxiety-like behavior in vivo . In addition, pathway analysis of the most significantly differentially expressed genes revealed an over- representation of oxidative stress related genes, further providingevidence for the involvement of this pathway in the regulation of anxiety. In the human study, specific alleles and haplotypes of six of the examined 13 homologs of the genes identified from mouse revealedsome evidence for association (p r0.01), although GLO1 and GSR were not among the most significantly associated genes. Discussion: Our findings suggest that oxidative stress is involved in the regulation of anxiety-like behavior in mice. Results from the humangenetic association study illustrate the potential utility of cross-speciesapproaches in identification of candidate genes for psychiatric disorders. Disclosure: I. Hovatta, None. Anxiety-Blame It on Oxidative Stress Samina Salim* University of Houston, Houston, TX Background: Anxiety disorders affect an estimated 40 million people in the U.S. As far as the treatment for anxiety disorders are concerned, benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors areconsidered the ''gold standard''. Their chronic use, however, leads totolerance, dependence and sedation. Better alternatives over existing anxiety treatments are needed. Since the focus of most anxiety research has been the traditional neurotransmitter systems including gammaamino butyric acid and serotonin receptor systems, a more broad understanding outside the classical theories of anxiety has been limited and has impeded discovery of novel interventions. A provocative concept away from these traditional theories is the involvement ofoxidative stress in anxiety. Several recent reports support this concept.Our own studies attest to this concept. Methods: We have employed biochemical and behavioral approaches to investigate direct involvement of oxidative stress in anxiety-likebehavior of rats. Intraperitoneal injections of L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) (300 mg/kg), an agent that increases oxidative stress were given to rats either for 3 or 7 days with or without antioxidant, tempol supplementation (1 mM in drinking water) and their effect onanxiety-like behavior was examined using light-dark and open-fieldanxiety tests. Oxidative stress was examined by malondialdehyde assay, nitrotyrosinylation and serum and urine 8-sioprostane levels. Results : Our results suggest that, increasing oxidative stress by pharmacological intervention using BSO treatment increased anxi- ety-like behavior of rats. Interestingly, treatment with the antioxidant, tempol reduced brain oxidative stress and attenuated anxiety-likebehavior of rats. These observations have prompted us to wonderabout the mechanism(s) that enable the anxiolytic effect of tempol. Our data point towards a unique role for two antioxidant enzymes, Glyoxalase (Glo) 1 and Glutathione reductase (Gsr) 1 in this process,suggesting that regulation of antioxidant protein pool is potentially animportant element of anxiety. Reduced Glo1 and Gsr1 proteins in the brain (hippocampus, amygdala and locus coeruleus) were observed in rats that exhibit anxiety-like behavior upon sub-chronic BSOtreatment (7 day) and were recovered with tempol treatment. On the other hand, short-term BSO treatment (3 day) increased oxidative stress but did not produce anxiety but these rats had increased Glo1and Gsr1 levels in hippocampus, amygdala and locus coeruleus, brainregions implicated in anxiety response .Two other antioxidant proteins, catalase and superoxide dismutase remained unchanged. Discussion: These findings make the relationship between oxidative stress and anxiety even more intriguing. Earlier, overexpression ofGlo1 and Gsr1 was reported to increase while inhibition of Glo1 expression to decrease anxiety-like behavior of mice. Another study has suggested a negative relationship between anxiety-like behaviorand Glo1 expression. Regardless of different outcome of results due togenetic variation or differences in models between studies, regulation of the antioxidant protein pool posits as an important element of anxiety. Whether the observed differential expression of Glo1 and Gsr1is simply associative with anxiety-like behavior or whether there is a causal role for these enzymes remains to be seen. Disclosure: S.

O'Donnell* West Virginia University, Morgantown, WVThe pathogenesis of several psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, has been linked to oxidative stress, in part viaalterations in cyclic nucleotide signaling. Phosphodiesterase-2 which is a component of the nitric oxide/guanylyl cyclase signaling pathway in neurons, may affect oxidative stress-induced behavioralchanges by increasing cyclic GMP signaling. Experiments were carriedout to examine the behavioral effects that result from increased oxidative stress. Mice were administered L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfox- imine (BSO), which altered indices of oxidative stress in brain regionsassociated with emotion and response to stress (i.e., amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus). This included increased lipid peroxida- tion, reduced capacity, and increased NADPH oxidasesubunits. Coincident with these neurochemical changes, an increase inanxiety-related behavior was observed using the elevated plus-maze, hole-board, and open-field tests. Administration of either effects of increased oxidative stress; Bay 60-7550 exhibited a somewhat greater effect against the increased anxiety than did diazepam. Treatment of cultured neurons in vitro with BSO also altered neurochemical indices in a manner consistent with increased oxidative stress. Treatment withthe PDE2 inhibitor Bay 60-7550 prevented the effects of BSO, while increasing cyclic GMP and phosphorylation of VASP by protein kinase G a mixed cyclic GMP/cyclic PDE, theeffects of selective inhibitors of PKG and PKA were The PKGinhibitor KT-5823, but not the PKA inhibitor H89, blocked the ability of Bay 60-7550 to prevent the oxidative stress caused by BSO, suggesting cyclic GMP mediation. In order to assess the relationshipbetween emotional stress and oxidative stress, mice were subjected toa repeated unpredictable stress (RUS) procedure. RUS produces anxiety-related behavior, demonstrated in the elevated plus-maze and hole-board tests, and depression-related behavior, demonstratedin the forced-swim and tail-suspension tests. These behavioral effects of RUS also were prevented by administration of the PDE2 inhibitor Bay 60-7550. Interestingly, RUS, in addition to alteringbehavior, also resulted in increased oxidative stress in amygdala,hypothalamus, and hippocampus, similar to that produced by BSO. Overall, the present findings suggest a relationship between oxidative stress and emotional stress, with its behavioral sequelae, consistentwith increased anxiety and depression. The effects of the Bay 60-7550in reversing both oxidative stress and subsequent behavioral changes suggests that PDE2 inhibitors and increased cyclic GMP signaling may have benefits in long-term psychiatric illnesses associated withoxidative stress.

Panel Session Plasticity of the Reward Circuitry in Depression and Stress- Related Disorders Mechanisms of Stress-Induced Synaptic and Behavioral Plasticity in Nucleus AccumbensScott J. Russo* Mount Sinai Medical School, New York, NYBackground: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is marked by a heterogeneous constellation of behavioral symptoms including both depressed mood and diminished interest in pleasurable stimuli (anhedonia), such as social interaction, sex and natural rewards. Adetailed understanding of the neural substrates and molecularmechanisms that mediate these symptoms will provide us with novel and more selective targets for drug development and ultimately increase the efficacy of treatment.Methods: Using chronic social defeat stress, a mouse model of stress- related mood dysfunction, we determined the molecular mechanisms controlling stress-induced synaptic plasticity of nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which are key brain rewardneurons that control mood. Results: We found that chronic stress increases the formation of new immature spine structures with small postsynaptic densities (PSD) thatcontain the molecular machinery for glutamatergic neurotransmission.These measures highly correlate with social avoidance: Animals with the smallest PSDs on MSNs, showed the greatest degree of social avoidance. We next wanted to identify the underlying molecularmechanisms responsible for this neuronal restructuring. We found anincrease in NF kB activity, which has been shown to regulate spineogenesis in the NAc. Using a herpes simplex virus (HSV) expressing a constitutively active I Kappa Kinase (IKKca) to activateNFkB or a dominant negative I Kappa Kinase (IKKdn) to inhibit NF kB, we show that stress-induced activation of NF kB in the NAc is both necessary and sufficient for social avoidance. In addition, blockingNFkB in susceptible animals blocks or reverses the formation of new spine structures on NAc MSNs, suggesting that this is a critical neuroadaptation driving social avoidance behavior. Although it is clear that NF kB regulates structural plasticity, the direct pathways down- stream of NF kB that control the actin cytoskeleton are completely unknown. Here we find that intracranial injections of the HSV-IKK mutants into the NAc resulted in gross changes in Rac1-PAK1 signaling, a RhoGTPase pathway known to mediate actin cytoskeletalreorganization and the development of new spines. Inhibition of NF kB with IKKdn decreases activity within the Rac1-PAK1 pathway, whereas IKKca greatly increases its activity. Interestingly, social defeat also reduces activity of Rac1 and PAK1 in the NAc, and viral mediatedrepression of Rac1 and PAK1 increase susceptibility to social defeat,further highlighting the importance of these new spines in regulating stress-induced avoidance. Discussion: These studies confirm an obligatory role of NAc NF kBi n regulating cell morphology and social avoidance, providing funda- mentally new information about the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in depressive disorders.Disclosure: S.J.

Two Faces of Stress: Chronic Cold and Restraint Produce Opposite Effects on VTA Dopamine Neuron Activity Anthony Grace*, Ornella Valenti University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA Introduction: Stress can have multiple effects on organisms, ranging from increasing responses to environmental stimuli in times of threat, to withdrawal during times of danger. Moreover, stress is known to be a context-dependent condition. Rats that are exposed to certain typesof anxiogenic stressors (e.g., restraint) show a cross-sensitization between the stress and the behavioral response to amphetamine. However, other types of maintained stressors actually depressdopamine system function. We examined how two different stressors,chronic cold and restraint, affect dopamine neuron activity states and the behavioral responses to amphetamine. Methods: One group of rats was exposed to two hours of restraint stress, and recorded 2 hours later. Another group of rats was shaved andexposed to 5 degrees C cold room for 14 days and recorded 24 hours later. Recordings were made from identified dopamine neurons in the VTA to assess: 1) population activity (DA neurons firing/track), firingrate, and burst firing. Locomotor activity was measured in an automated activity monitor after injection of saline or amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg). Results: We found that rats exposed to restraint stress show an increase in the number of DA neurons firing (population activity) andan increased behavioral activation by amphetamine; both of these are reversed when the ventral subiculum is inactivated. Furthermore, this corresponded to increased c-fos staining in the ventral subiculum, acontext-related area. In contrast, chronic cold stress leads to a decreasein DA neuron population activity, and a decrease in the behavioral response to amphetamine, with no c-fos activation in the ventral subiculum.Discussion: These data suggest that stressors that are behaviorally activating tend to increase DA neuron drive in a context-dependent manner, whereas those associated with depressed conditions attenuateDA neuron drive. The population activity, or number of dopamineneurons firing, we propose reflects the responsivity of the DA system to external stimuli. Restraint stress, by causing a context-dependent increase in DA neuron population activity, renders the system hyper-responsive to potentially rewarding or threatening stimuli when in anenvironment reflective of these events. In contrast, constant inescap- able cold stress leads to a decrease in DA neuron population activity and response to amphetamine, thereby diminishing the response of theorganism to external stimuli. As a result, this latter condition wouldbetter reflect an anhedonic state more common of depression than of anxiety.S7 ACNP 49th Annual ConferenceDisclosure: A.A.

Long-Lasting Alterations in the Reward System After Chronic Mild Stress: The Potential of Localized Brain Stimulation Abraham Zangen* Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, IsraelBackground : Stress related disorders are likely to result from atypical processing and integration of information by several neural networks.Various types of neuroadaptations were identified within reward-related brain regions after chronic stress. Convergence of glutamater- gic innervations from limbic and cortical structures under intense dopaminergic modulations, places the nucleus accumbens (NAc) asthe major site for integration of emotional salience, contextual constraints and executive/motor plans. In this presentation I will describe our studies on long-lasting effects of chronic mild stress(CMS) on behavior, plasticity as measured by spontaneous and evokedresponses in the NAc, and the potential of localized brain stimulation as a tool to investigate and affect plasticity in the reward system. Methods: Rats were exposed during 4 weeks to either CMS or enriched environment, or a control conditio n. Behavioral analysis included measurements of sucrose preference and exploration of a novel environment. Electrophysiological recording in the NAc were used to measure long-lasting alterations in spontaneous activity (includingspectral analysis) and evoked resp onses induced by stimulation of the ventral subiculum (vSub). In other groups of rats exposed to CMS we have measured the potential benefit of repeated electrical stimulation of reward- related brain sites on neuroplasticity and the behavioral impairments.Results: CMS induced reduction in sucrose preference and exploration of a novel environment. These animals displayed an increase in spontaneous patterned network activity in the NAc and increasedsensitivity of the vSub-NAc pathway. In contrast, the ability to sustaintime-locked, hippocampally evoked, network response was strongly reduced. Repeated electrical stimulation of the NAc or the ventral (but not the dorsal) prelimbic cortex normalized sucrose by brain-derived neuro-trophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus. Discussion : Our studies indicate that stressful life-experience induces depressive-like behavior and is associated with in-vivo , long-term functional adaptations in the reward system. CMS left a long-lasting mark on the NAc network activity, properties and response. These adaptations are suggested to reflect impaired plasticity in the rewardsystem and are potentially affected by repeated localized electricalstimulation. Part 4. Major Depression and Childhood Adversity Are Associated with Dysfunctions Within the Reward CircuitryDiego A. Daniel G. Dillon, Dan Iosifescu, University, Cambridge, MA Background: Anhedonia (lack of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli) is a cardinal symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) and has been associated with increased vulnerability to psychopathology and poortreatment outcome across disorders. Adverse, or stressful experiencesencountered early in life have also been associated with the later development of psychopathology, including depression. Research in non-human animals has shown that adverse rearing environments andchronic stressors lead to dysregulated function within the brain rewardcircuitry and anhedonic behavior, but the etiological mechanisms andneurobiological underpinnings of anhedonia have not been well characterized in humans. In two studies, we tested the hypothesis that MDD participants and individuals exposed to childhood adversity would show reduced reward-related responses in basal ganglia regionsimplicated in incentive motivation, hedonic coding of stimuli, andreinforcement learning. Methods: In both studies, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in conjunction with a monetary incentive delay taskthat dissociates anticipatory and consummatory phases of rewardprocessing. Between-group comparisons focused on neural responses to cues signaling possible monetary rewards (reward anticipation), as well as delivery of monetary gains (reward outcome).Results: In Study 1, relative to healthy controls (n \u00bc31), MDD participants (n \u00bc26) showed significantly weaker responses to reward delivery in the left nucleus accumbens and bilateral caudate. In addition, the MDD group displayed reduced activation in response to reward-predicting cues in a small section of the left posterior putamen, although evidence for group differences during reward anticipation was weaker than in response to monetary gains. In the MDD group, severity ofdepressive and anhedonic symptoms were associated with reducedcaudate volume bilaterally. In Study 2, individuals exposed to childhood adversity (n \u00bc13) showed weaker responses to reward-predicting cues in the left global pallidus and putamen compared with healthy controlparticipants (n \u00bc31). Those who had experienced early adversity also reported elevated symptoms of anhedonia and depression, and rated reward cues less positively than controls. No group differences emerged in basal ganglia responses to reward delivery in Study 2.Conclusions: Collectively, these findings indicate that MDD subjects and individuals with a history of early adversity are characterized by blunted responsiveness in mesolimbic pathways implicated in hedoniccoding and reinforcement learning. Results of Study 1 specificallyindicate that basal ganglia dysfunction in major depression may primarily affect the consummatory phase of reward processing, and that anhedonic symptoms in MDD are related to caudate volume.Findings from Study 2 suggest that childhood adversity in humans isassociated with dysfunction in left basal ganglia regions involved in reward-learning and motivation, as well as blunted subjective responses to reward-predicting cues. These findings may haveimportant implications for improving interventions for individualswith, or at increased risk for MDD. Disclosure: D.A.

Panel Session Recent Advances in Glutamatergic Treatment of Schizophrenia Pathophysiological Basis of NMDA Dysfunction in Schizophrenia Daniel Javitt* Nathan Kline Institute/New York University School of Medicine, Orangeburg, NY Background: Negative symptoms and cognitive deficits are well established features of schizophrenia, but underlying mechanisms remain relatively obscure. This panel focuses on the role of N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) dysfunction as a potential underlying pathophy-siological feature of schizophrenia. NMDA theories of SZ were firstdeveloped based upon observations that NMDA antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine induce symptoms and cognitive deficits closely resembling those of SZ, and have been supported sincethen by genetic findings and clinical studies. NMDA receptors aredistributed in a widespread fashion throughout cortex and subcortical structures but within each cortical region are associated with only limited types of processing. As such, deficits in cognition in SZ shouldbe widespread, but only involve NMDA-related processes. as an NMDA deficiency disorder.S8 ACNP 49th Annual ConferenceMethods: Data will be presented from representative datasets investigating contributions of specific NMDA-mediated processes such as non-linear gain, oscillatory entrainment and re-entrant processing to neurocognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms inSZ. Non-linear gain was investigated within sensory modalities usingERP and fMRI methods relative to findings in rodent and primate neurophysiological models. Symptom studies investigated potential underpinnings of negative symptoms using positive and negativevalence stimuli along with direct behavioral observations.Results: Patients showed decreased NMDA-related sensory responses within both visual and auditory modalities. In the visual modality, patients showed reduced non-linear gain of magnocellular response,with relatively intact linear gain components. A combined ERP/fMRIstudy showed relatively intact attention-related brain activation despite impaired early sensory response, suggesting preservation of specific top- down mechanisms despite early neurophysiological dysfunction. . In theauditory modality, patients showed impaired inter-trial coherence to repetitive stimuli along with impaired cross-frequency coupling, implicating impaired synchronization mechanisms. These findings areconsistent with impaired local NMDA-dependent re-entrant processingwithin auditory cortex in SZ. In the behavioral studies, SZ showed no reduction in hedonia but did show increases in ambivalence, consistent with impaired NMDA-dependent non-linear gain and reciprocalinhibition within emotional brain regions as underpinnings ofsymptoms as well as cognitive dysfunction in SZ. Discussion: These findings suggest that basic NMDA-related processes such as non-linear gain and phase synchronization are impairedthroughout brain in SZ. These deficits are present in both sensory and higher cognitive brain regions and thus may underlie the overall pattern of neurocognitive dysfunction in SZ. On a symptom level,behavioral studies suggest that increases in ambivalence may be morecritical than impairments in reward in understanding negative symptoms, consistent with NMDA hypotheses and findings in primate models of SZ. As with cognitive deficits, therefore, negative symptomsmay be explained by failures of non-linear gain within underlyingbrain regions and may improve following Part 4; No, Part 5. Modifying NMDA Receptor Function in Healthy Humans by Glycine, mGluR2/3 and N-acetyl-cysteine John H. Krystal*, Handan Gunduz-Bruce, Naomi Driesen, Deepak C.D'Souza Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, Yale University, New Haven, CT Schizophrenia appears to be associated with glutamatergic synaptic abnormalities that compromise NMDA glutamate receptor function. However, schizophrenia is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder whose component pathophysiologic mechanisms are not well under-stood. This presentation will focus on studies that have used ketamineinfusion in healthy human subjects to model deficits in NMDA receptor function that might be associated with schizophrenia. In particular, this presentation will present findings from three studies.We will begin by briefly reviewing a published study of the mGluR2/3agonist, LY354740. This study suggested that mGluR2/3 agonism attenuated the disruption of working memory produced by ketamine and tended to reduce its psychotigenic effects. Next, we will report newdata on the impact of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) pretreatment on ketamine effects in healthy humans (n \u00bc16). Preliminary analyses suggest that NAC may reduce ketamine's effects on P300 disruption.However, NAC pretreatment had mixed effects upon the behavioraleffects of ketamine in healthy subjects. Lastly, we will report behavioral and fMRI data on the impact of glycine pretreatment upon ketamine effects in healthy human subjects. These data provide preliminarysupport for the hypothesis that prefrontal cortical deficits associated with ketamine administration might be attenuated by enhancing the stimulation of the glycine site of the NMDA receptor complex.

Effects of the Glycine Transporter Typ1 Inhibitor RG1678 in Schizophrenic Patients with Predominant Negative Symptoms Daniel Umbricht*, Kisook Yoo, Eriene Youssef, Alberati, Santarelli F. Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Nutley, NJ Background: Deficient signaling through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been hypothesized to be a key factor underlying many signs and symptoms of schizophrenia. Targeting the allostericglycine site of the NMDA receptor has been proposed an approach toenhance NMDA receptor functioning. Studies with full and partial agonists at the glycine site and sarcosine, a naturally occurring inhibitor of the glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT1), have provided initialsupport for this hypothesis. However, some of these studies have beenhampered by the need to administer huge doses of agonists, or by the relatively unselective nature of GlyT1 inhibition. RG1678 is a potent and non-competitive inhibitor of the glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT1)with more than 1000 fold selectivity for the human GlyT1 versus the GlyT2 transporter and at least 300 fold greater selectivity over other targets. Preclinically, it shows efficacy in assays of NMDA receptorfunctioning and schizophrenia models and increases CSF glycine levelsin a dose-dependent fashion. Methods: The effects of RG1678 on negative symptoms of schizo- phrenia were investigated in a phase IIb proof-of-concept study.Patients with prominent negative symptoms who were stable onantipsychotic treatment were randomized equally to 8 weeks of treatment with three doses of RG1678 (10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg) or placebo once daily. Efficacy parameters were: Change from baseline in thePANSS negative symptom factor score (NSFS; Marder G; Clin Psychiatry ), as showing Z20% improvement in NSFS and CGI-Improvement of Negative Symptoms. Functional effects wereassessed with the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale. Results: 3.7). RG1678 demonstrated a robust and clinica lly meaningful effect on negative symptoms. Compared to placebo signifi cantly greater improvements were observed on negative symptoms as measured by change in the NSFS, percentage of patients meeting response criteria and CGI-Improvement of Negative Symptoms. In addition a positive effect on functioning as assessed by the change in PSP score from baseline was observed in patientstreated with RG1678. RG1678 was well to lerated. The percentage of patients withdrawn for AEs ranged from 1% to 9%. The percentage of withdrawals for any reason was similar in all four treatment groups (13-20%). Discussion: RG1678 demonstrated a robust, consistent and clinically meaningful reduction of negative symptoms that was accompanied byan emergence of positive functional effects. This proof-of-concept study is the first to provide clinical support for glycine reuptake inhibition as a therapeutic approach for negative symptoms inschizophrenia in patients whose symptomatology was specificallycharacterized by predominant negative symptoms.

Umbricht, Hoffmann-La Ltd., Part 1.S9 ACNP 49th Annual ConferenceModulation of Glutamate Signaling at Multiple Levels for Treatment of Postitive Symptoms and Cognitive Disturbances in Schizophrenia Jeffrey Conn* Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TNBackground: The glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia has led to a major focus on development of that could ameliorate the symptoms ofschizophrenia by regulating glutamatergic transmission. One approachthat has been employed with some success in proof of concept studies is the use of modulatory site agonists at the NMDA receptor such as glycine and D-cycloserine. However, it has not been possible todevelop direct ligands at the glycine site or other direct modulators ofthe NMDA receptor that are suitable for development as therapeutic agents. We and others have taken alternative approaches to modulate glutamatergic signaling in a manner that may provide efficacy intreatment of schizophrenia. Methods: We have used molecular pharmacology, electrophysiology, behavioral, and imaging approaches to assess the effects of compoundsthat regulate glutamatergic function in brain circuits that may beimportant for treatment of schizophrenia patients. For instance, we have developed highly selective positive allosteric modulators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor as the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. M1 and mGluR5potentiate currents through NMDA receptor channels in cortical, contrast, mGluR2 modulates pathways in a manner that may offset effects ofNMDA receptor hypofunction. In addition to developing selective activators of GPCRs that regulate NMDA receptors, we have evaluated effects of novel highly selective inhibitors of the GlyT1 glycinetransporter.Results: Selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of mGluR2, mGluR5 and M1 are all effective in modulating specific aspects of glutamatergic signaling in forebrain regions in brain slices and in vivo . In addition, modulators of each of these receptors has efficacy inanimal models that have been used to predict antipsychotic effects and mGluR5 and M1 PAMs have efficacy in improving different domains of cognitive function. New selective inhibitors of GlyT1 also have efficacyin animal models that are commonly used to predict efficacy in treatment of schizophrenia. Interestingly, newer competitive inhibitors of GlyT1 that are not based on the sarcosine scaffold do not have theadverse effects that have been observed with earlier compounds.Discussion: The finding that highly selective agents that target different aspects of glutamatergic signaling provides strong support for the hypothesis that modulation of glutamatergic signaling in limbic andforebrain regions may provide an exciting approach for treatment ofmultiple symptom clusters that are observed in schizophrenia patients.

Panel Session Social Stress Models for Depression and Drug Abuse Individual Differences in Stress Reactivity During Social Stress May Predict Susceptibility and Resilience to Depression andCardiovascular Co-Morbidity: Role of Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Susan K. Wood*, Seema Valentino Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA Background: Affective disorders increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the neurobiological systems involved in thisco-morbidity are poorly understood. In rodents, social stress increases depressive-like behaviors and elicits robust noradrenergic stimulation. We previously reported the emergence of two pheno- typic populations during social defeat in Sprague Dawley rats;one population exhibited passive behaviors and short latencies toexhibit a supine defeat posture (SL, o300 s) while the other exhibited active behaviors (eg., upright posture) and longer defeat latencies (LL,4300 s). We concluded that the SL subset was more susceptible to a depressive phenotype. In the present studies, because activecoping strategies result in greater noradrenergic stimulation, we hypothesize that the LL phenotype may be more susceptible to stress- induced cardiovascular dysfunction. The stress-related neuropeptide,corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), is implicated in affectivedisorders and CRF1 activation within the brain elicits both central and peripheral noradrenergic activation and therefore represents a putative mediator of co-morbid cardiovascular and affectivedisorders. Methods: The resident-intruder model was used whereby Sprague Dawley intruder rats were placed into the cage of an aggressive LongEvans resident during 7 daily defeats (30 min/day). Rats were treatedwith vehicle or the centrally-active CRF1 antagonist NBI-30775 (10 mg/ kg) 1 hr prior to defeat on days 1-7. The latency for an intruder to exhibit a supine, submissive posture was recorded daily. In vivo ECG telemetry was conducted on days 1, 4, and 7 at rest and during defeatand the time-domain index of heart rate variability (HRV), SDNN, was calculated to identify shifts in sympathetic-parasympathetic balance. The Porsolt forced swim test (FST) was conducted under drug-freeconditions 24 hrs after the 7th defeat. Results: Thirty-eight percent of vehicle-treated rats exhibited the SL phenotype, while only 9% of NBI-30775 treated rats exhibitedan SL phenotype. Immobility was increased during the FST in vehicle-treated SL and LL rats compared with controls, while this effect was blocked in rats treated with NBI-30775 during defeat. Increased cardiac:body weight, suggestive of maladaptive cardiac was positively correlated with defeat latency (r \u00bc0.62, p\u00bc0.0007). A reduction in heart rate variability (SDNN), indicative of a shift towards sympathetic dominance, occurred in both SL and LL rats at rest on the 7th day of defeat compared with controls.Interestingly, administration of NBI-30775 inhibited the developmentof reduced HRV. Discussion: Decreased HRV is observed in depressed patients and is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease. In thepresent study, a reduction in resting HRV occurred in all vehicle- treated defeated rats but LL rats were more susceptible to maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy, whereas treatment with NBI-30775 inhibitedthe cardiovascular repercussions of defeat. These data also suggestthat passive stress coping and development of depressive-like behaviors is, in part, mediated by CRF1 activation. These studies reveal a role for CRF1 to mediate the development of stress-induceddepressive-like behavior and exaggerated sympathetic activity andimplicate CRF1 as a novel therapeutic target for co-morbid depression and cardiovascular disease.

The functional activity of infralimbic and prelimbic cells were inferred from zif268 expression, CREB activity, and c-fos expression after chronic socialdefeat stress. Here, we report that cellular indicators of functionalactivity, including the immediate early gene zif268 and the transcrip- tion factor creb, are reduced in prefrontal cortex of depressed human brains obtained postmortem and after chronic social stress in mice.Deficits in mPFC functional activity persist long after social stress, andthese deficits are corrected via stimulation of the mPFC using virally- mediated expression of channel rhodopsin 2 (ChR2) which when activated with a blue laser (470 nm) will result in neuronal firing. Laserstimulations mimicking patterns of mPFC ''burst'' firing, not onlyrestored functional activity, but also corrected behaviors impaired by social stress, indicating strong antidepressant-like effects of mPFC stimulation.Disclosure : H.E.

HDAC6 Sarah Teegarden, Sheryl Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PABackground: The HDAC6 protein that we examine in this study is a novel therapeutic candidate emerged from the burgeoning field of epigenetics. HDAC genes encode a family of lysine deacetylases targeted by a novel class of anticancer therapy called HDAC inhibitors(HDACis). Non-selective HDACis, that promote protein hyper-acetylation in the brain, have demonstrated consistent behavioral activity across various rodent models of affective disorders and antidepressant response, including the chronic social defeat (SD)paradigm. Although most studies, thus far, have interpreted this antidepressant-like activity in the context of chromatin-remodeling mechanisms (ie the canonical role of HDACs) it is now well establishedthat the influence of HDACs extends far beyond histones andtranscriptional regulation. In fact, certain HDACs, such as HDAC6, are involved primarily in ''chromatin-independent'' functions. These include the regulation of chaperone proteins such as HSP90, animportant component of steroid receptor signaling. Previous tissueculture studies, in non neuronal systems, have shown that inhibition of HDAC6 blunts glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) signaling, an important determinant of stress vulnerability. In the present studies we askedwhether this regulatory role extends to neuronal tissues in culture, and to the mouse social defeat model in vivo . Methods: The SD paradigm in mice was used to assess individual vulnerability to behavioral effects of social stress, as well as GRreceptor function. HDAC6 pattern of expression was mapped in the mouse and human brain using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, and regulation of HDAC6 after SD and antidepressanttreatments was examined using qPCR. To test the causal role ofHDAC6 in stress resiliency we have generated 2 lines of mutant mice lacking HDAC6 in distinct neuronal populations. Results: Our mapping data indicates that HDAC6 protein is found in several brain areas in the mouse and human brain, but the densest clusters of HDAC6-positive cells are encountered in the raphe nuclei where HDAC6 co-localizes with serotonergic markers of HDAC6 promote resilience to social defeat an effect associated with HSP90 hyperacetylation in serotonin neurons,and blunted GR-mediated gene regulation. The effects SD onelectrophysiological and morphological properties 5-HT neurons are being examined in HDAC6 KO. Conclusion: Our data support the view that HDAC6 is a candidate target for antidepressant and pro-resilience interventions throughtargeted inhibition of GR signaling in the serotonergic system.

Veenema*, Michael Lukas, Remco Bredewold, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, University Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA Background: Early life stress (child neglect, child abuse, child trauma) is a major risk factor for the development of pervasive social deficits that are a key feature of several psychiatric disorders, including depression and aggression disorders.Methods: Early life stress is modelled in rodents by separating the pups from their mother for 3 h per day during the first two weeks of life (maternal separation). It is well known that maternal sepa- ration causes long-lasting changes in emotional and neuroendocrineresponses. We investigated whether maternal separation alters the development of social behavior in male Wistar rats and whether this is associated with changes in the brain vasopressin system.Vasopressin is an important regulator of diverse aspects of socialbehavior. Results: Maternal separation increased aggressive behaviors during juvenile play-fighting and during adult resident-intruder aggres-sion, which was accompanied by increased vasopressin mRNAexpression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus of both juvenile and adult rats. Moreover, maternal separation impaired social recognition (lack of discrimination between a familiar andunfamiliar rat), which was associated with a diminished capacity to show a rise in vasopressin release within the septum, as was found in control male rats. Application of synthetic vasopressin duringthe acquisition phase restored social recognition in maternal separatedrats. Discussion: These findings demonstrate that early life stress changes several aspects of social behavior which are caused by alterations in thebrain vasopressin system.Disclosure : A.H.

Charles Nemeroff and David Pickar will take thePro position - ''Yes, there is a roadblock.'' Nemeroff will present genetic and imaging data that support the biological heterogeneity of depression. Nemeroff asserts that the resistance by industry to targetsubtypes of depression is a roadblock for drug development. Pickarwill argue that continuing emphasis on monotherapy for schizo- phrenia rather than building on and enhancing antipsychotic drug effects mechanisms holds back clinical advance. Pickar will presentdata of alpha2 antagonist augmentation of predictors of outcome. George Koob and Michael Thase will take the Con position - ''No roadblock.'' Koob will discuss the use of animal models for medication develop-ment in the domains of anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders with a focus on face and predictive validity. He will argue that a process termed the ''Rosetta Stone'' approach whereexisting pharmacotherapies are used to validate and improve animalmodels holds promise to directly advance new drug development. Thase will argue that the apparent roadblock in developing novel treatments for depression and related disorders is more ofS11 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencea perceptual illusion than an actual obstruction, partly a conse- quence of several decades of relative inattention to the methodo- logical factors that ensure the internal validity of clinical trials.

Appelbaum and Thomas Kosten University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PANeuropsychiatry researchers frequently identify problems in obtaining IRB approval of research proposals. ACNP Council charged the Human Research Committee with conducting a survey of members to identify common IRB problems and solutions, and approvedposting of case examples on the website as a member service.Two cases derived from the ACNP survey, Solutions for Common IRB Issues in Neuropsychiatry, will be presented with recreation of the process of objections, rebuttals, and iterative compromises thatresulted in resolution and IRB approval. ACNP members were divided in their opinions about the appropriateness of IRB approval, which makes these cases likely to stimulate a lively debate. Dr. Wisnerwill present the dilemma of an NIMH-funded R01 that was deniedIRB approval due to inclusion of a placebo control group in a randomized trial comparing a novel antidepressant agent with a standard antidepressant drug for postpartum depression. The IRB'sprimary concern was that it is not ethical to withhold efficacioustreatment from depressed individuals and directed removal of the placebo group. The investigator's view was that removing the placebo group risked finding that a novel agent is as efficacious as astandard drug without knowing whether either is more efficacious than placebo in postpartum women. In the survey, 18% of ACNP respondents said their IRB would not approve, 31% said their IRBwould approve, and 51% thought their IRB might approve the inclusionof a placebo control with conditions imposed. Dr. Kosten will present the second case, which involves conducting an ethnographic interview on drug dependent adolescents attending a juvenile probationoutpatient treatment program in three states and including adolescentswho refuse to allow contacting their parents for consent. The IRB concerns include concealing information from parents, state law variability about age of independent consent, coercion of theseadolescent ''prisoners'', whether a certificate of confidentiality protects disclosure of the illegal drug activities, and conditions for mandatory reporting of drug activity, sexual activity, AIDS risk, child abuseand suicidality. In the ACNP survey, 15% of ACNP respondents saidtheir IRB would not approve, 42% said their IRB would approve, and 43% thought their IRB might approve with parental consent. Dr. Appelbaum will moderate the study group and summarize thetheoretical underpinnings of the issues to close the discussion of eachcase.

Study Group Session Where Is the Big Payoff of Psychiatric Genetics: GWAS, NextgenSequencing, or Biology-Based Studies?David Rubinow*, Patrick Sullivan and Daniel Weinberger UNC School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NCThe power and promise of genomics for uncovering the roots of psychiatric illnesses are indisputable. More controversial, however, ishow the various possible genetic investigations that should be prioritized. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) occupy a central role in this controversy. On one hand, GWAS are the coin of the realm - large scalestudies that, as Patrick Sullivan has argued, avoid many of the pitfalls ofS12 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencecandidate gene association studies (i.e., small n, selective post-hoc hypotheses, high false positive rate, infrequent replication of findings [failure to find either the same disease:gene associations or associations with the same specific structural variants]. On the other hand, as DanielWeinberger has argued, the GWA model is based on a linear, predictablerelationship between risk and illness that belies the pathophysiological complexity and heterogeneity of psychiatric syndromes. This Pro-Con study group will promote discussion of the strengths and weaknesses ofGWAS v. targeted gene association studies as strategies to understand thegenetic predispositions to psychiatric illnesses.

Tuesday, December 7, 2010 Panel Session Habenula Session 1: Role of the Habenula in Addiction and Emotional States Role of the Lateral Habenula in Motivational Control of Animal Behaviors Masayuki Matsumoto* Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, Japan Background: Animals learn to obtain rewards and to avoid punish- ments. The lateral habenula (LHb) is a good candidate for the neural mechanism underlying such learning. Indeed, our recent studysuggested that neurons in the LHb are inhibited by reward and excited by reward omission, and that these reward-related signals are transmitted from the LHb to midbrain dopamine neurons which areinvolved in learning and motivation (Matsumoto & Hikosaka, 2007).However, it was unclear whether the reward-related signals of the LHb actually influence animal behaviors. In this talk, I will present our recent data showing the role of the LHb signals in behaviors.Methods: W ef i r s te x a m i n e dw h a tk i n do fi n f o r m a t i o ni ss i g n a l e db y neurons in the LHb. For this purpose, we recorded the activity of LHb neurons in monkeys during a Pavlovian procedure with an appetitive unconditioned stimulus (liquid rewa rd) and an aversive unconditioned stimulus (airpuff directed at the face) . This Pavlovian procedure consisted of two blocks of trials, a reward block and a punishment block. In the reward block, three conditioned stimuli were associated with reward, withprobabilities of 100%, 50% and 0%. In the punishment block, threeconditioned stimuli were associated with airpuff, with probabilities of 100%, 50% and 0%. Thus, this Pavlovian procedure had two distinct contexts: one in which reward was available and another in whichaversive airpuff was feared. This P avlovian procedure enabled us to examine whether LHb neurons encode punishment-related signals as well as reward-related signals. To examine whether the LHb signals influence animal behaviors, we next artifici ally activated the LHb by electrical stimulation while monkeys were per forming a visually guided saccade task. The visual target was presented randomly on the right or left and the monkey had to make a saccade to it immediately. Saccades to onedirection were followed by electrical stimulation of the LHb whilesaccades to the other direction were not. Results: In the first experiment, we found that LHb neurons were most strongly excited by a conditioned stimulus associated with the mostunpleasant event in each block. Thus, the LHb neurons showed thestrongest excitation to the conditioned stimulus associated with 0% reward in the reward block and the conditioned stimulus associated with 100% airpuff in the punishment block. The magnitude of theexcitation decreased as the reward probability increased and theairpuff probability decreased. These results suggest that LHb neurons encode negative value signals induced by both reward and aversiveairpuff. In the second experiment, we found that the latency of the saccade associated with the post-saccadic electrical stimulation of the LHb increased gradually as the saccade was repeatedly followed by the stimulation. The latency of the saccade that was not associatedwith the LHb stimulation decreased gradually. These gradual changesin suggest that the post-saccadic LHb stimulation suppresses saccadic eye movements by influencing a learning mechanism, rather than a motor execution mechanism.Discussion: Together with the recording experiment showing the activation of LHb neurons by the unpleasant conditioned stimuli, the electrical stimulation experiment suggested that the activity of LHb neurons contributes to learning to suppress behaviors which wouldlead to unpleasant events. Whether the LHb stimulation effect ismediated by dopamine neurons remains to be determined. Disclosure: M. Matsumoto, None. Genetic and Molecular Studies to Dissect the Contribution of the Habenular Circuit to Brain Function and BehaviorInes Ibanez-Tallon* Max-Delbrueck-Centrum, Berlin, GermanyThe habenular complex is a crossroad f or descending projections from the f o r e b r a i nt on u c l e ii nt h em i da n dh i ndbrain. Such feedback relay could be key in the modulation of a variety of behavioral functions including cognition, reward and social behaviors. We are investigating the contribution of specific receptors, i on channels and transporters in the control of neurotransmission from medial habenula. Given the dense concentration of nAChR in habenu lar neurosn and the recent genome wide association studi es linking the CHRNB4-CHRNA3-CHRNA5 gene c l u s t e rt on i c o t i n ea d d i c t i o n ,w ea r ei n v e s t i g a t i n gt h er o l eo ft h e b4s u b u n i t to nicotinic function using transg enic mice (Tabac mice) expressing elevated levels of b4 in the habenula. Targeted overexpression of b4r e s u l t s in strong potentiation of nicotine-ev oked currents and surface expression of functional a3b4-containing recepto rs in these mice. Behaviorally, Tabac mice displayed decreased social interaction and aggression, as well as increased sensitivity to nicotine an d pronounced aversion to nicotine. Using a combination of bioinformatics analysis and in vitro functional mapping experiments we have mapped this potentiation property to asingle domain unique in b4. These data establish that the b4i sr a t e - limiting for nAChR activity and nicotine responsiveness in vivo and provides a novel mechanis tic insight into the involvement of the CHRNB4- CHRNA3-CHRNA5 gene cluster in nico tine consumption. In addition to approach the molecular complexity of the habenula we have collected TRAP (Translational ribosome affini ty profiling) data and discovered and characterized a number of ion channels and transporters in this population (i.e. BK channels, ASIC channels, R-typ e voltage-gated calcium channels) that may work in combination with nAChRs. Detailed electrophysiological and biochemical studies are in progress to test the idea that one of thesemolecules forms a direct interaction with nAChRs and contributes tonicotine dependence. Furthermore we have optimized a series of lentivirus tethered toxin constructs that block neurotransmission and are well suited for functional dissection of neura l circuits (Auer et al. 2010. Nature Methods). Some of these are Cre dependent, and they are now being introduced into an habenula specific C r e - r e c o m b i n a s et r a n s g e n i cl i n ef o r functional analysis of the habenula. In conclusion, we are employing avariety of genetic approaches to diss ect the function of the habenula in the mammalian brain and to determine its molecular properties. Disclosure: I.

Stronger Excitatory Synapse onto Neurons That Signal Disappointment in Depressed Rats Bo Li* Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYThe cellular basis of depressive disorders is poorly understood. Recent studies in monkeys indicate that neurons in the lateral habenulaS13 ACNP 49th Annual Conference(LHb), a nucleus that mediates communication between forebrain and midbrain structures, increase their activity when an animal fails to receive an expected positive reward, i.e. these neurons provide a disappointment signal. LHb neurons project to and modulatedopamine-rich regions such as the ventral-tegmental area (VTA) andsubstantia nigra that control reward-seeking behavior and participate in depressive disorders. Here we show in two rat models of depression that excitatory synapses onto LHb neurons projecting to the VTA arepotentiated. Synaptic potentiation is due to an enhanced presynapticrelease probability. Depleting transmitter release by repeated electrical stimulation of LHb afferents, using a protocol that can be effective on depressed patients, dramatically suppresses synaptic drive onto VTA-projecting LHb neurons in brain slices and significantly reducesdepression-like behavior in rats. Our results suggest that increased presynaptic action onto LHb neurons contributes to depression by enhancing disappointment signals leading to reduced reward-seekingbehavior. Disclosure: B.

Glick* Albany Medical College, Albany, NYBackground: Many new agents, including dopamine agonists and antagonists, GABA agonists, glutamate antagonists, opioid partialagonists, and catalytic antibodies, are being studied and/or developed as potential treatments for drug abuse. Most of these treatments are targeted at a specific drug or drug class of abuse. However, wediscovered that 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), an iboga alkaloid congener, has the potential to be useful in treating multiple forms of drug abuse. In rats, 18-MC decreased the self-administration ofmorphine (Glick et al. 1996), cocaine (Glick et al., 2000a), nicotine (Glick et al., 2000a) and alcohol (Rezvani et al., 1997) while having no effect on responding for water (Glick et al., 1996a, 1998). Subsequent studies showed that 18-MC'sprimary mechanism of action is to selectively block a3b4 nicotinic receptors (Glick et al., 2002; Pace et al., 2004). These results led us to hypothesize that the a3b4 receptor was a viable as well as novel target around which to develop treatments for drug addiction (Maisonneuveand Glick, 2003). The mechanisms of action of virtually all drugs of abuse appear to involve the dopaminergic mesolimbic system, and new anti-addictive medications are usually designed to affect this system.Although 18-MC also affects this system, it does so indirectly via otherpathways (cf. Maisonneuve and Glick, 2003). It was in fact the distribution of a3b4 nicotinic receptors in the brain that suggested a role of these other pathways in mediating 18-MC's behavioral effects,since and interpeduncular nucleus (e.g., Klink et al., 2001; Quick et al., 1999). Methods and Results: The interpeduncular nucleus receives its main input from the medial habenula, forming the habenulo-interpedun- cular pathway in the fasciculus retroflexus. While there are multiple avenues for interaction between this pathway and the mesolimbicpathway in the medial forebrain bundle, it has been known since the1980's that the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway can function as a reward system separate from the mesolimbic pathway (e.g., Sutherland and Nakajima, 1981), although it appears that the two pathwaysmodulate each other. Based on its a3b4 nicotinic antagonist action, we postulated that 18-MC might act in the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway to dampen the activity of the mesolimbic pathway. Accordingly, we found that local administration of 18-MC into eitherthe medial habenula or interpeduncular 2006) and methamphetamine (Glick et al., 2008) self-administration in rats and also blocked sensitization ofmorphine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (Taraschenko et al., 2007). Discussion: Nicotinic a3b4 receptor subtypes are thought to be located on the soma of the medial habenula efferents and on axon terminals to the nucleus (Clarke et al., 1986; Mulleet al., 1991). Cholinergic activation of nicotinic receptors in the interpeduncular nucleus has been shown to enhance glutamate (Girod and Role, 2001) and GABA release (Lena et al., 1993), therebyregulating the excitatory and inhibitory output of this structure.Interference with neuronal activity in this system may be the basis for the putative ''broad spectrum'' anti-addictive activity Panel Session Hippocampal-Prefrontal Interactions: A Genetic Risk Mechanism for Schizophrenia Fronto-Temporal Connectivity in Psychosis Philip McGuire* Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom Background: For over a century, theoretical models have proposed that psychosis results from a disruption of normal connectivitybetween brain regions. Data from a range of neuroimaging studies using different techniques are broadly consistent with this hypothesis, and have particularly implicated fronto-temporal dysconnectivity inpsychosis.Methods: In a series of studies, patients with first episode psychosis, subjects at ultra high risk of psychosis, and controls were compared using functional MRI, volumetric MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, MRSpectroscopy and PET. Data were analysed using voxel-basedapproaches, tractography, functional connectivity and dynamic causal modeling. Results: Both first episode patients and high risk subjects showed altered fronto-temporal functional connectivity and altered anatomicalconnectivity relative to controls. The severity of the findings in the high risk group was often intermediate to that in first episode patients. Within the temporal lobe, findings were particularly evident in theparahippocampal region, where there were also local changes in glutamate levels, and altered functional connectivity with the striatum, in association with elevated striatal dopamine function.Discussion: Data from several studies across a range of imaging modalities point to an alteration in the normal relationship between prefrontal and temporal cortex in subjects with psychosis. The presence of similar findings in subjects with prodromal symptomsindicates that these changes are not secondary to the disorder or itstreatment, but predate its full clinical expression. These human data are consistent with findings from contemporary animal models of psychosis.Disclosure: P. McGuire, None. Genome-Wide Significant Risk Variants for Psychosis and Hippocampal-Prefrontal Interactions Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg* Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim, Germany Background: Disturbed interactions between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus have been found in manifest schizophrenia, but the relevance of this finding for genetic risk for psychosis was unclear. Therecent identification and confirmation of genome-wide significant riskvariants for schizophrenia, combined with imaging genetics, permits a strong inference on the contribution of limbic-prefrontal connectivity to the genetic risk architecture.S14 ACNP 49th Annual ConferenceMethod: In 115/117 healthy German participants from the general population genotyped for common SNPs in ZNF804A and CACNA1C, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a well-validated executive cognition task probe, the n-back task, shown to beabnormal in schizophrenia, related to heritable risk, and sensitive togenetic variation in candidate genes, as well as a newly developed episodic memory paradigm. We employed conservative analysis statistics by applying family-wise error and Gaussian random fieldtheory previously shown to exert strong control of type I errorover multiple comparisons in imaging genetics. We studied regional brain activation of DLPFC and HF during task performance as well as coupling between these structures using functional connecti-vity, a well-established correlative measure. We also used the samemethod to study connectivity during an emotional face matching task and resting. Results: For ZNF804A, during the n-back task, no regional activation effects were observed, but the HF was uncoupled from DLPFC (p o.0001, uncorrected; p o.01, corrected for multiple comparisons, coordinates of maximum effect[-36 -21 -18]). This finding was present only during working memory, but not during face matching or at rest. For CACNA1C, strong regional activation deficits were observed in HF together with abnormalcoupling between left and right HF.Discussion: Abnormal functional coupling of the DLPFC with HF found here for carriers of the ZNF804 variant mirrors findings in overt schizophrenia, implicating this pathomechanism for the disorder as amediator of genetic risk. The finding was tied to working memory and not found in control conditions. Our data therefore show a degree of disease-related and cognitive specificity on the systems level thatcorresponds closely to the genetic association with the psychiatric-behavioral phenotype and imply that DLPFC-HF coupling contributes to genetic risk for psychosis in the broader sense. For CACNA1C, a more local effect in HF was identified that corresponds closely tofinding in knockout mouse models of this variant. Even here,connectivity of HF was disturbed. Taken together, our data support a key role of HF and DLPFC connectivity in schizophrenia neurogenetics.Disclosure: A. Eli Lilly, Part 1; Novartis, Servier, Part 1; Roche, Part 2. Impaired Hippocampal-Prefrontal Synchrony in Genetic Mouse Models of Schizophrenia Joshua Gordon* Columbia University, New York, NYBackground: Abnormal functional connectivity between brain areas has been postulated as an important pathophysiological mechanismunderlying schizophrenia. In particular, neuroimaging and electro-encephalographic studies suggest that functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the temporal lobe is altered in schizophrenia patients. However, it is unclear how such dysconnectivity is related tothe etiology of the illness. Furthermore, because patient studies are based on macroscopic measurements of brain activity, it is not known how abnormal functional connectivity is manifest at the level ofneuronal circuits. Because schizophrenia has a strong geneticcomponent, mouse models of genetic risk factors are likely to play an important role in clarifying these issues. Methods: We therefore studied neural activity in Df(16)A + /- mice, which model a microdeletion on human chromosome 22 (22q11.2) thatconstitutes one of the largest known genetic risk factors for schizo- phrenia. We recorded activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of these mice while they performed a task requiring workingmemory, one of the cognitive functions disrupted in the disease.Results: In wild-type mice, hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony increases during performance the discrete-trial T-maze task, a testof spatial working memory. Df(16)A + /- mice, which are impaired in the acquisition of this task, show dramatically reduced synchrony, measured both by phase-locking of prefrontal cells to hippo- campal theta oscillations and by coherence of prefrontal andhippocampal local field potentials. Furthermore, the magnitude ofhippocampal-prefrontal coherence at the onset of training was correlated with the time it took animals to learn the task. Phase locking of prefrontal cells to the local theta rhythm was unaffectedin Df(16)A + /- mice, as was theta power in the prefrontal cortex andhippocampus, suggesting a specific impairment in synchrony between the two structures. Discussion: These data suggest how the deficits in functional connectivity observed in patients with schizophrenia may be realizedat the single neuron level. Our findings further argue that impaired long-range synchrony of neural activity is one consequence of the 22q11.2 deletion and may be a fundamental component of thepathophysiology underlying schizophrenia.

Altered Prefrontal-Hippocampal Coupling: A Potential Intermediate Phenotype for Schizophrenia and Association with ZNF804a Daniel Weinberger* Clinical Brain Disorders Branch, NIMH, Bethesda, MD Background: Abnormal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation has consistently been found in patients with schizophrenia (PTS) and in genetically high risk subjects, implicating it as a riskassociated intermediate biologic phenotype. Recent studies haveshown patterns of abnormal DLPFC functional connectivity with other brain areas in schizophrenia and strong association of these patterns with a potential susceptibility gene ( ZNF804a ). However, whether DLPFC connectivity is a trait phenomenon linked to genetic risk for illness is not known and without this knowledge, the association of ZNF804a with this physiologic measure cannot be taken as evidence of a neural system mechanism of clinical genetic risk. We performed anfMRI study to test the hypothesis that altered connectivity is a heritable feature of genetic risk for schizophrenia. Method: We investigated the functional connectivity of DLPFC in healthy siblings (SIBS) of PTS compared with normal controls(NCS). Four-hundred-two subjects (153 NCS, 171 SIBS, and 78 PTS) participated in this study. Each participant underwent BOLD fMRI (3T) while performing the 2-back working memory task. NCS were alsogenotyped for rs1344706 in ZNF804A, a SNP that showed genome wide significance in an earlier clinical association study of psychosis (O'Donovan et al 2008) and also showed significant association withmeasures of prefrontal functional connectivity in an imaging geneticstudy of normal subjects. (Esslinger et al, 2009). The effects of familiality and of genotype were explored both on DLPFC activity and connectivity. Task-independent and task-dependent functional cou-pling analyses- between DLPFC and other potential brain 'target'regions- were performed with 1) the traditional seeded connectivity, and 2) psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis to investigate the interaction between task load (2 back versus 0 back) andconnectivity. Results: Consistent with prior reports, SIBS showed greater PFC activation than NCS despite normal performance (i.e. greater inefficiency). Between group comparisons in the seeded connectivityanalysis showed a significant increase in the negative coupling between right DLPFC and right hippocampus in PTS and SIBS when compared to NCS. The same groups (SIBS and PTS) also showed a decrease in thepositive functional coupling between right DLPFC and right IPL. In thePPI analysis, SIBS showed an intermediate pattern of diminished modulation of the positive coupling between right DLPFC and hippocampus compared to NCS. Notably, connectivity measures andprefrontal activation measures within individuals did not correlate.ZNF804A genotype Annual The coupling and its task related modulation between DLPFC and other brain regions is compromised in SIBS of PTS /and is independent of DLPFC engagement per se , suggesting a novel independent neural system intermediate phenotype related to geneticrisk for schizophrenia. The selective association of ZNF804a with this phenotype and not with prefrontal efficiency per se suggests that this intermediate phenotype proxies a distinct neural system mecha- nism related to genetic risk for schizophrenia and the biology ofthis gene.Disclosure: D.R.

Wallace* University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA Bioenergetic dysfunction is being found to be a common factor in a wide range of rare and common diseases. Rare diseases associated with more severe mutations in nuclear DNA (nDNA) and/ormitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded bioenergetic genes nowconstitute a well established class of diseases. These mitochondrial diseases encompass phenotypes ranging from lethal childhood Leigh syndrome to adult-onset diabetes and neuro-psychiatric disorders.Because bioenergetics requires the interaction of over a thousand nDNA genes as well as the maternally-inherited and multi-copy phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, of diseases can be highly complex.Characterization of the genetics, biochemistry, and physiology of mitochondrial diseases has produced concepts that are applicable to a wide spectrum of metabolic and degenerative diseases, cancer, andaging. The importance of bioenergetic dysfunction in the commondiseases initially escaped the attention of the Western medical community because Western medical thinking was based on a predominately anatomical perspective of disease and a Mendelianperspective of genetics. However, the search for common disease variants in the nDNA has been relatively unproductive. An important clue as to why this is true comes from the fact that the environ-ment pays a major role in the etiology of common diseases. Theprimary component of the environment is the availability of and demands on energy (calories), which varies both regionally and seasonally. Adjusting to regional bioenergetic differences requireschanges in cellular energetics that are stable over thousands of years.This is most readily achieved by the accumulation of functional variants in the mtDNA bioenergetic genes, the mtDNA having a high mutation rate, with the highly deleterious mutations being eliminatedvia an intra-ovarian selective system. Environmental energeticfluctuations are managed by epigenomic regulation, mediated by mitochondrial high energy intermediates. Finally, the mtDNAs in post- mitotic organs like the brain accumulate age-related somatic mtDNAmutations which result in the progressive decline in mitochondrial function, providing the aging clock. Since the tissue most reliant on mitochondrial energetics is the central nervous system, subtle changesin mitochondrial bioenergetics can result in changes in mood andbehavior. Therefore, predisposition to psychiatric disorders should be influenced by variation in mtDNA and nDNA bioenergetic genes, the age-related accumulation of brain somatic mtDNA mutations, andenvironmental stressors which alter the regulation of bioenergeticgenes and precipitate symptoms.

Moon, William Bunney, Erin Smith, John Kelsoe University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CABackground: Theories of mitochondrial deficiency in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have been proposed due to bio-energeticalterations found in brain imaging and postmortem studies of oxidative phosphorylation pathways. This presentation will address the potential role of somatic mtDNA variants and increase inheteroplasmy in different vulnerable brain regions and to whatextent normal aging can account for the rates of mutations in brain. Risk for psychiatric disorders might be increased in certain mtDNA haplogroups. Unique data on ethnic specific haplogroupmtDNA SNPs and risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder will be presented using datasets from the Genetic Association Information Network.Methods: The amount and number of somatic mutations in mtDNA (homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mutations) across 11 brain regions was studied with Illumina GAII resequencing (80 samples). The hypothesis that specific risk variants such as heteroplasmy accumu-lates in brain and are either not present or present at lower levels ingerm line tissue such as blood was tested. BD association was tested in a case-control analysis of the Genetic Association Information Network (1743 subjects) mtDNA SNP data from GAIN bipolar workinggroup for European ancestry (EA) using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with multidimensional scaling cluster stratifications. The mtDNA genotype calls were made in batches to balance cases and controlsusing Birdseed analysis. The GAIN schizophrenia cases (n \u00bc1161) and controls (n \u00bc1372) were also tested for the same mtDNA allele procedure for association and majority of controls overlap in BD and SZ analyses.Results: Brain MtDNA genome resequencing (average coverage 1250x) showed novel homoplasmic mutations in coding regions while the rate of homoplasmic mutation was greater in non-coding mtDNA regions. Over 20 novel mtDNA coding variants were foundin brain. The GAIN-BD-EA analysis was highly significant particularly at two loci (p-value before correction for CMH test stratified by 4 PCA components: T7028C and G12308A) which are ethnic specifichaplogroup markers. The GAIN SZ-EA analysis was nominallysignificant for one SNP before correction (T7028C) but G12308A did Discussion: Resequencing mtDNA generation sequencing high coverage and allows homoplasmy detection in brain forsomatic mutations. This preliminary GAIN mtDNA association analysis requires caution, as it cannot be excluded that BD subjects were genotyped on separate plates from controls so that a bias in callsmight explain the results. Given this caveat, however the currentanalysis suggests that matrilineal descendants may have lower prevalence or risk of BD that carry SNP T7028C and higher risk for individuals with G12308A. These relative risks between these twogroups require further replication in independent samples. At this time it is not possible to exclude somatic accumulation of mutations and haplogroup risk as mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatricdisorders.Disclosure: M.P. Vawter, None. Neural Basis of Mice Accumulating Deleted Mitochondrial DNATadafumi Kato* Brain Science Institute, Saitama, JapanBipolar disorder is characterized by recurrent manic and depressive episodes and genetic factors contribute to its pathophysiology. However, it is still not known how bi-directional behavioral changes are caused by genetic factors. Neuroprotective effects of moodS16 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencestabilizers suggest that vulnerability of neurons is involved in its pathophysiology. Multiple lines of evidence suggest the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder: altered energy metabolism in the brain detected by magnetic resonancespectroscopy, comorbidity of mood disorders in mitochondrialdiseases, altered expression of mitochondria-related genes, and accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in the postmortem brains. We developed mutant polymerase gamma (Polg)transgenic (Tg) mice with neuron-specific accumulation of mutantmtDNAs. The mice showed bipolar disorder-like phenotypes such as periodic change of wheel running activity and distorted diurnal activity rhythm, which is improved by lithium treatment. By searchingfor the genes commonly altered in the Tg mice and the postmortembrains of patients with bipolar disorder, we found that Ppif, encoding cyclophilin D, was commonly altered. We tested the effect of a brain blood barrier-permeable cyclophilin D inhibitor, and found that it waseffective for the behavioral phenotype of the Tg mice. To further search for the neural basis of the bipolar disorder-like phenotypes in the Tg mice, we searched for the brain regions accumulating partiallydeleted mtDNAs, by developing a method for quantitative mapping ofdeleted mtDNA. Using this method, we found that deleted mtDNAs are specifically accumulated in several brain areas related to the regulation of emotion. Deleted mtDNAs are reported to be preferentiallyamplified due to its shorter length, and dominate in cells after mtDNAdepletion. We now speculate that deleted mtDNAs accumulate in the neural systems that undergo active neuroplastic changes, and dendrites accumulating deleted mtDNAs become more vulnerable tostress, resulting in viscous cycle.

Setting the Balance: Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Postmortem Brain from Patients with Bipolar Disorder L. Trevor Young*, Ana C. Andreazza, Jun-Feng Wang University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, CanadaBackground: Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage underlies the pathophysiology ofbipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). Previous studies inour lab have shown that the mRNA levels of NADH ubiquinone Fe-S protein subunit of chain complex-1, was significant lower in post-mortem prefrontal cortex of BD subjects. In addition, BD patientshave increased lipid peroxidation and serum levels of the 3-nitrotyrosine in cingulate cortex and serum, respectively. The propose of this study is evaluate whether decreased NDUFS7levels result in decreased complex I activity and increased oxidative damage to proteins in prefrontal cortex depressive disorder (MDD) or SCZ, and from non-psychiatric comparison controls was generously provided by the Stanley Founda- tion Neuropathology Consortium. Assays were carried out inmitochondrial from prefrontal cortex of subjects.NDUFS7 protein and carbonyl groups (protein oxidation) levels were measured using immunoblotting analysis. The activity of complex-1 was measured by following the decrease in absorbance of NADH at340 nm with a diode-array spectrophotometer. The tyrosine-nitrationinduced damage was evaluated by measuring the levels of 3-nitro- tyrosine with a competitive enzyme immunoassay.Results: NDUFS7 levels and complex I activity were decreased significantly in prefrontal cortex from individuals with BD, but were unchanged in MDD and SCZ patients, compared to non-psychiatric controls. Protein oxidation levels were increased significantly in BDwhereas levels for MDD and SCZ patients did not differ significantlyfrom control. In tissue from both BD and SCZ we observed increased levels of tyrosine-nitration induced damage. Conclusions: These findings suggest that impairment of complex I may lead to increased protein oxidation in BD. Therefore, mitochondrialdysfunction and oxidative damage may be potential biomarkers for the illness or may help guide terapeutics. Disclosure: L.

Panel Session mTOR Signaling: At the Crossroads of Synaptic Plasticity and Signaling: Synaptic Plasticity, Memory, Developmental DisabilityEric Klann* New York University, New York, NYBackground : A requirement for de novo protein synthesis is one of the hallmarks of long-lasting synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. Recent studies, including several from our laboratory, have identified signaling cascades, including the mTOR signaling pathway, that coupleneurotransmitter and neurotrophin receptors to the translationregulatory machinery in the hippocampus during synaptic plasticity and memory. Interestingly, mutations in negative upstream regulators and downstream effectors of mTOR are associated with certain types ofdevelopmental disability and autism. Synaptic plasticity and memoryphenotypes in genetically engineered mice that display altered mTOR signaling will be discussed. Methods: Mice with a conditional deletion for tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) and transgenic mice with a mutation in the GAPdomain of TSC2 were used to model tuberous sclerosis, and transgenic mice that overexpress eIF4E were used to model non-syndromic autism in these studies. Molecular studies were conducted in thehippocampus and cortex of the mutant mice to examine mTOR signaling and rates of protein synthesis. Protein synthesis-dependent forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity also were examined in themutant mice. Finally, a battery of behavioral tests were conducted todetermine whether the mice displayed altered phenotypes consistent with human patients with tuberous sclerosis and autism. Results: We have found that the mouse models of tuberous sclerosis have multiple molecular, synaptic plasticity, and behavioral pheno-types. Studies with eIF4E transgenic mice were begun recently and the results will be discussed at the meeting. Discussion: These studies have revealed interesting links between mTOR signaling, synaptic plasticity, memory, and behavior. These studies also have provided insight into the molecular basis of certain types of developmental disability and autism.Disclosure: E. Klann: None. AMPA Receptor- and BDNF-Mediated Regulation of Local Protein Synthesis in HippocampusMichel Baudry* University of Southern California, Los factor (BDNF) stimulates local dendritic mRNA translation and is involved in formation and consolidation of memory. CX614, one of the best studied positive AMPA receptor modulators (a.k.a. ampakines), increases BDNFS17 and protein and facilitates LTP induction. We were therefore interested in determining whether positive AMPA receptor modulation could also rapidly stimulate local dendritic mRNA translation in a BDNF-dependent manner. Moreover, we previously showed thatCX614 could rapidly activate the calcium-dependent protease calpain,and we determined whether calpain activation could participate in CX614-mediated increase in local protein synthesis. Methods: We used primary neuronal cultures as well as acute hippocampal slices to study the effects of BDNF and CX614 on theprotein synthesis machinery (mTOR and associated proteins, 4EBP1, and p70S6 K). Activation of local protein synthesis was determined by western blots and immunohistochemistry. It was also determined byusing a green fluorescent (GFP) reporter cDNA flanked by the 0and 30 untranslated regions (UTR) from the CaMKII asubunit. Finally, we used TrkB-Fc in primary cultured neurons to trap released BDNF in combination with western blotting, in order to determine the effect ofCX614 treatment on BDNF release. Results: CX614 treatment of primary neuronal cultures and acute hippocampal slices rapidly activated the translation machinery andincreased local dendritic protein synthesis. The acute effect of CX614on translation was mediated by increased BDNF release as demon- with a BDNF scavenging assay using TrkB-Fc during CX614 treatment of cultured primary neurons and was blocked by nifedipine,ryanodine, and by lack of extracellular Ca ++in acute hippocampal Finally, CX614, increased dendritic transla- tion of an exogenous translation reporter. We previously showed that both CX614 and BDNF activated the calcium-dependent proteasecalpain in primary neuronal cultures and acute hippocampal slices. Interestingly, the stimulatory effects of BDNF on local protein synthesis required the activation of m-calpain through ERK-mediatedphosphorylation.Discussion: Our findings that positive modulation of AMPA receptor function by ampakines results in BDNF release and activation of local protein synthesis machinery and local protein synthesis, in particularARC and possibly CaMKII a, shed new light on the cellular/molecular events implicated in synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, since calpain inhibition reduced BDNF-mediated mTOR activation, our results provide unique links between several elements that have long beenproposed to participate in synaptic plasticity, BDNF, (mPFC) Aghajanian* Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CTBackground: Previous studies in mouse models have shown that a genetic deficiency in brain-derived neurotrophic factor mPFC layer V pyramidal cells. There are several reports that a single sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine, which induces a robust increase in cortical BDNF,has a rapid antidepressant effect in treatment-resistant depressed patients. Based on its BDNF releasing properties, we hypothesized that ketamine might have an effect on synaptic function opposite to that ofBDNF deficiency.Methods: The influence of ketamine on synaptic physiology and structure was examined by means of whole cell patch clamp recording and 2-photon laser scanning in rat and mouse mPFC brain slices.Results: Twenty-four hrs after a single dose of ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), we found a large increase in the frequency of EPSCs induced by serotonin (5-HT) or hypocretin/orexin (hcrt), suggesting enhancement of both cortico-cortical and thalamic inputs. In both cases, EPSCamplitude was increased, corresponding to the peak period ofketamine-induced elevation in pre- and postsynaptic-synaptic proteins (e.g., AMPA/GluR1, synapsin I, and PDS-95) (Duman, this panel). Inparallel with the increase in EPSC frequency and synaptic proteins, imaging of the recorded cells revealed an increase in spine density in proximal and distal apical tuft segments of of layer V cells. In addition to increased spine density, there was an increase in spine size andEPSC amplitude, indicating greater spine maturity. The above effectsof ketamine were diminished in knock-in mice with BDNF which blocks mTOR downstream from BDNF.Discussion: These results indicate that the increase in mPFC synaptogenesis induced by ketamine is mediated via the BDNF/mTOR pathway. We suggest that enhanced synaptic connectivity in mPFC and possibly other regions may underlie ketamine's ability to produce arapid antidepressant effects both in animal models and clinically.Disclosure: G.

Rapid Antidepressant Actions of Ketamine Require Stimulation of Mammalian Target of Rapaymicin (mTOR) Signaling and Synaptic Protein Synthesis Ronald Duman* Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CTBackground : The rapid antidepressant response seen following ketamine administration in treatment resistant depressed patientsdemonstrates a powerful new approach for treating mood disorderscompared to the weeks or months required for standard medications. Ketamine is a non-selective glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist. However, the molecular and cellularmechanisms underlying the rapid and efficacious therapeutic actionsof ketamine are likely more complicated than simple NMDA receptor blockade, and so far have not been identified. We carried out a series of studies to examine the cellular signaling pathways that mediate thebehavioral actions of ketamine, focusing on cascades known to rapidly influence synaptic plasticity, most notably the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.Methods : Levels of the phosphorylated and activated forms of mTOR and related signaling proteins, 4E-BP1 and p70S6K, were determined by western blot analysis of synaptoneurosome preparations of prefrontal cortex (PFC). Levels and synapsin I, were alsodetermined. The role of mTOR signaling in the behavioral actions of ketamine in the forced swim test (FST), learned helplessness (LH), and chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)/anhedonia model was determinedby pre-infusion with rapamycin (ICV). The role of mTOR signaling in the antidepressant actions of an NMDA receptor (NR2B) subtype selective antagonist, Ro 25-6981, was also examined.Results: Here we report that a low, behaviorally active dose of ketamine rapidly (1 hr) stimulates mTOR signaling, including increased levels of phosphorylated mTOR, 4E-BP1, and p70S6K. Ketamine administration also produced a hr) increase inlevels of the synaptic proteins rapamycin, these synaptic proteins. Moreover, rapamycin pre-infusion completelyblocked the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine in and CUS/anhedonia model. antagonist, also rapidly increased mTOR signaling, and its antidepressantbehavioral responses were blocked by rapamycin.Discussion : Fast activation of mTOR signaling, elevation of synapse associated proteins, and increased density and function of spines (see G Aghajanian) represents a novel mechanism for the rapid anti-depressant actions of ketamine. These effects provide a mechanism forrapid reversal of stress- and/or depression-mediated atrophy of PFC neurons, reported in studies of rodent models and in postmortem tissue of depressed subjects. Identification of the signaling pathwaysunderlying the rapid induction of synapses in the PFC provides noveltargets for drug development, including NR2B selective compounds, but also agents that could directly influence mTOR signaling, such asS18 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencemetabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), and other as yet unidentified receptors that represent novel and promising drug targets.

Part Panel Session Sex, Stress, Modulation ofNeurodevelopment and Adult Behavioral Susceptibilities Sex-Specific Transgenerational Programming of Stress Dysregulation Tracy L. Bale* University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA Background : Sex-biased neurodevelopmental disorders, including depression, anxiety, autism and schizophrenia, have been associated with maternal stress or perturbations experienced during pregnancy.The mechanisms through which fetal antecedents contribute to diseasedevelopment are not well understood, though likely involve a complex interaction between maternal environment, placental changes, embryo sex and epigenetic programming.Methods : We have recently identified a sensitive period of early gestation where stress has sex-specific long-term programming effects on offspring stress pathway neurodevelopment. Dams were exposed to chronic, variable stress for the first 7 days pregnancy. Male and femaleoffspring were examined as adults in tests of stress coping, including atail suspension test, forced swim test, and Barnes maze. HPA axis stress response was also measured following a 15-min restraint stress. Gene expression patterns were determined by Taqman RT-PCR frommicropunches of specific brain regions. Mechanistic examination was conducted for changes in inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in male and female placentas from prenatally stressed dams. Secondgeneration animals were generated to determine the heritabilityof these outcomes and to identify potential epigenetic targets regulating genes involved in programming stress pathways and neurodevelopment.Results: Male offspring showed increased stress sensitivity as adults in behavioral and physiological stress measures including tests assessing learning and memory, anhedonia, and coping strategies and a heightened HPA stress axis response. CRF expression is significantlyincreased in the amygdala and glucocorticoid receptors are signifi- cantly reduced in the hippocampus in these mice. Fitting with their behavioral and physiological stress phenotype, these males also appeardemasculinized as adults with reduced testosterone levels, smallertestis weight, and shorter anogenital distances suggesting a disruption in normal masculinization during development. Mechanistically, we have assessed the involvement of the placenta in transmittinginformation as to stress-mediated changes in the maternal milieu tothe developing embryo. We have identified sex-specific effects of maternal stress on placental inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and epigenetic machinery. Further, recently generated second genera-tion offspring also show a stress-sensitive phenotype in males produced from the first generation paternal lineage, supporting a transgenerational epigenetic mode of transmission. These males alsodemonstrate a potential disruption in normal perinatal masculiniza-tion similar to first generation males. Analyses of gene expression patterns during early brain development suggest alterations in GABA signaling in these mice.Discussion: These results may provide critical insight into the mechanisms contributing to sex biased disease vulnerability to prenatal stress during early pregnancy. As many neurodevelopmental disorders have a sex bias in presentation, these studies may identifynovel gene targets and contributing mechanisms in the etiology ofthese diseases. Disclosure: T.L. Bale: Part 4; AstraZeneca.Enduring Consequences of Maternal High Fat Diet for Brain Inflammation and Behavior of Male and Female Offspring Staci Bilbo* Duke University, Durham, NCBackground: Maternal obesity is an increasing public health concern, and is associated with a number of adverse outcomes for both motherand baby. Increased adipose tissue in obese individuals is character-ized by low-grade inflammation, which likely contributes to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Obesity and peripheral inflammation are also each independently associated with cognitivedisorders such as Alzheimer's and dementia, although a direct linkamong these factors is lacking. That is, whether peripheral inflamma- tion in obesity contributes directly to inflammation in the brain, and thus cognitive disruption, remains unclear. Moreover, whethermaternal obesity has any influence on inflammation of offspring, particularly in brain regions important for cognition (e.g., hippocam- pus), is completely unknown.Methods: Female breeders were fed one of 3 diets: 1) 60% saturated high fat diet (SFD), 2) 60% high trans fat diet (TFD), or 3) 10% saturated low fat diet (LFD) for 4 weeks prior to mating, and remained on the diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. A subset of pup brainsand peripheral tissues were collected 1 day (P1) or 20 days (P20) afterbirth. A second group of pups were analyzed for anxiety and spatial cognition in adulthood, and brains were also collected at P60, after being placed on standard lab chow at weaning. For tissue collection atP20 & P60, rats were injected with saline or bacterial lipopolysacchar- ide (LPS) and brains were collected 4 h later, in order to assess the response to a specific inflammatory challenge.Results: SFD/TFD exposure significantly increased body weight and leptin in both moms and pups compared to controls. Several inflammatory markers were increased at P1 in both males and females, including CD11b & toll-like-receptor (TLR) 4 (markers of microglialactivation) in the hippocampus, and C-reactive protein in the liver. Atweaning and in adulthood, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was strikingly increased in the periphery and hippocampus following a bacterial challenge (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) in the SFD/TFD groupscompared to controls, but the influence of each diet differed by sex. Microglial activation within the hippocampus was also increased basally in SFD rats, suggesting a chronic priming of the cells. Finally,there were marked changes in anxiety and spatial learning in SFD/TFDgroups. Discussion: These effects were all observed in adulthood even after the pups were placed on standard chow at weaning, suggesting theseoutcomes were programmed early in life. Taken together, we havedemonstrated marked, enduring effects of maternal saturated and trans fat diets on brain inflammation and cognitive outcomes in the offspring.Disclosure: S. Bilbo: None. Non-Genomic Transmission of Maternal and Paternal Effects Frances A. Champagne* Columbia University, New York, NYBackground: Individual differences in anxiety-like and social behavior have been observed in laboratory rodents and we have previouslydemonstrated the role of variations in early-life mother-infant interactions in shaping the molecular and neurobiological substrates of these behaviors. More recently, we have explored the interactionbetween maternal and paternal influences on development and themechanisms through which a transgenerational impact of social experiences can occur. Methods: In the current series of studies, we used both a genetic and environmental approach to the study of the inheritance ofparental effects. In mice lacking a functional copy of the paternally expressed imprinted genes Peg1 orPeg3 , we assessed response toS19 ACNP 49th maternal behavior, and the development of non-mutant (WT) offspring and grand-offspring of knockout (KO) females. To study the parental transmission of environmental effects, we exposed male Balb/c mice to postnatal and juvenile environments charac-terized by social/physical isolation (ISO), enrichment (ENR), orstandard rearing conditions (STD). In adulthood, males were mated with STD reared females, separated from the female 1 week prior to parturition, and mother-infant interactions with offspring wereobserved.Results: Transgenic mice lacking a functional copy of Peg3 or Peg1 exhibit heightened inhibition of novelty and impairments in social/reproductive behavior. In female knockout mice, there are alsogross impairments in prenatal and postnatal maternal care. KO femalesdisplay significant reductions in gestational food intake (p o.05), increased latencies to retrieve pups on postnatal Day 0 (p o.01), and exhibit reduced nursing and licking/grooming (LG) of pups during thefirst week postpartum (p o.05). Non-mutant offspring of these females were found to display behavioral inhibition and decreased motivation to retrieve pups and grand-offspring were observed to have elevatedlatencies to explore a novel environment. Amongst Balb/c males, ENRrearing lead to reduced anxiety-like behavior (increased exploration of a novel environment; reduced fecal boli) compared to ISO males. Females mated with ISO males exhibited reduced nursing and LG ofpups (po.05) during the early postnatal period compared to females mated with ENR males. This paternally-induced change in maternal behavior was not associated with the level of anxiety-like behavior displayed by the male.Discussion: These studies illustrate a non-genomic transmission of paternal effects. In the transgenerational studies of Peg1 and Peg3 , data indicate that despite the lack of transmission of the geneticperturbation ( Peg1 and Peg3 mutations are only expressed when inherited from knockout males) there is an inheritance of the phenotypic characteristics associated with the knockout. We have also observed the influence of paternal social experiences in miceon maternal behavior with implications for the development ofsubsequent generations of offspring. Taken together, these studies illustrate the interplay that can occur between maternal and paternal influences and the possibility of maternally mediatedpaternal genetic and environmental effects. We are currently explo-ring the neuroendocrine and molecular mechanisms through which these within and across generation influences on behavior are achieved.Disclosure: F.A. Champagne: None. Age at Migration and Risk Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NYBackground: Many previous studies have demonstrated increased risk of psychotic disorders in specific immigrant/ethnic minority groups in the UK and Holland. Studies from The Hague have shown an increased risk in both first and second generation immigrant/minority groupscompared with Dutch. They have also shown that the increased risk in immigrant/minority groups is associated with a low density of own ethnic group in the neighborhood of residence, which suggests thatsocial context may play a role. Thus far, however, neither UK norDutch studies have ruled out selective migration as an explanation. Nor have they determined the relevant timing of exposure. Methods: Data will be presented from a large ongoing study of incident psychoses in The Hague. This study identifies the individuals aged15-54 making contact with a physician for a suspected psychotic disorder in The Hague; administers diagnostic interviews to these individuals; and assigns DSM IV diagnoses by consensus of twopsychiatrists. A comprehensive municipal registration system providesthe denominator. The study size is sufficient to examine incidence rates in immigrants from Morocco, Surinam, Turkey, NetherlandsAntilles, other Non-Western countries, and in Dutch. For the present analysis, we obtained additional data on age at migration in order to address selective migration and timing of exposure. The data for this analysis includes 358 non-Western immigrants and 226 Dutch withfirst onset psychoses.Results: Risk was most elevated (about three fold) among immigrants who arrived in Holland before age 5. This was similar to the increased risk in second generation immigrant/minority groups. These resultswere consistent across each of the immigrant/minority groups. Theywere also similar in men and women. Discussion: From the increased risk in immigrants who arrived before age 5, we infer that selective migration cannot explain the increasedrisk of psychotic disorders in immigrant/ethnic minority groups in TheHague. From the series of findings in The Hague, taken together, we infer that the social experience of immigrant/ethnic minority status during early childhood years may play an important role in theirincreased risk of psychotic disorders. It has previously been established that early social experience can influence neurodevelopment and we discuss some of the pathways that may pertain to these results.Disclosure: E. Susser: None. Panel Session Stimulant Pro-Drugs as Potential Treatments for CocaineDependence Neurochemistry of Stimulant Prodrug Medications Michael H. Baumann* IRP, NIDA, NIH, Baltimore, MD Background: The abuse liability of stimulant medications could be reduced by using prodrug formulations. Prodrugs are inactive entities that are converted to active medicines after systemic administration. Here we describe the neurochemistry of stimulant prodrugs, andpresent unique Methods: In vitro assays measuring uptake and release of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) were conducted in ratbrain synaptosomes. In vivo neurochemical effects were examined microdialysis in n. accumbens. Dialysate concentra- tions of were measured HPLC-ECD.Results: PDM and DEP displayed no activity in assays measuring uptake and release. The N-demethylated metabolite of PDM (i.e., phenmetrazine) was a potent releaser DA (IC50 had no effect on extracellular transmitter levels when administered locally into the n. accumbens, whereas the N-dealkylated metabolites of both drugs afforded dose-related elevations in DA and 5-HT. Conclusions: PDM and DEP appear to be prodrugs which are converted to active medicines after systemic administration. Prodrugsmay be desirable agonist medications for cocaine dependence, sinceslower rates of active drug entering the brain would be predicted to reduce addictive properties of the prescribed formulations. Disclosure: M.H. Baumann, None. Evaluation of Cocaine Analogs as Cocaine Medications in Nonhuman Primates Leonard Howell* Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA Background: Given the important role of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in the addictive properties of cocaine, the development and useS20 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceof compounds that target the DAT represents a reasonable approach for the pharmacological treatment of cocaine abuse. Methods: The present report describes a series of studies conducted in nonhuman primates that evaluated the effectiveness of phenyltropaneDAT inhibitors in reducing cocaine self-administration. In addition,drug substitution studies evaluated the abuse liability of the DAT inhibitors. PET neuroimaging studies quantified DAT occupancy at behaviorally relevant doses, characterized the time-course of druguptake in brain, and documented drug-induced changes in cerebralblood flow as a model of brain activation. Lastly, in vivo microdialysis quantified drug-induced changes in neurochemistry associated with drug effects on behavior.Results: Selective DAT inhibitors were effective in reducing cocaine use but high ( 470%) levels of DAT occupancy were associated with significant reductions in cocaine self-administration. The selective DAT inhibitors were reliably self-administered but rates of respondingwere lower than those maintained by cocaine even at higher levels of DAT occupancy. A profile of slow rate of drug uptake in brain accompanied by a gradual increase in extracellular dopamine mayaccount for the more limited reinforcing effectiveness of the DATinhibitors. Selective serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitors were also effective in reducing cocaine use and blocked cocaine-induced brain activation and increases in extracellular dopamine. Co-administrationof SERT inhibitors with a selective DAT inhibitor was more effectivethan the DAT inhibitor administered alone, even at comparable levels of DAT occupancy. Discussion: The results indicate that selective DAT inhibitors seem promising as cocaine medications based on preclinical evaluations. However, their reinforcing effects in animal models indicate that they may exhibit high abuse liability that could limit their clinical utility. Inaddition, the effects of high levels of DAT occupancy that are requiredto reduce cocaine use are unknown. Alternatively, development of medications involving dual actions at DAT and SERT could lead to compounds with cocaine-like properties appropriate in substitute-agonist pharmacotherapy but with limited abuse liability. Hence,combined inhibition of DAT and SERT may be a viable approach to treat cocaine addiction. Disclosure: Howell, None. Effects of Monoamine Releasers on Cocaine Self-Administration by Rhesus MonkeysS Stevens Negus* Commonwealth University, Richmond, VABackground: Amphetamine and other monoamine releasers (MARs) serve as one class of target active metabolites for prodrugs that mayserve as candidate agonist-medications for the treatment of stimulant dependence. The pharmacologic selectivity of MARs for promoting release of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE)may influence the behavioral selectivity of these compounds to safelyreduce stimulant self-administration. This talk will review data from a series of experiments that have examined effects of chronic treatment with a range of MARs on responding maintained by a stimulant(cocaine) and a non-drug reinforcer (food) in rhesus monkeys. Methods: Rhesus monkeys implanted with chronic intravenous double-lumen catheters had access to cocaine (0-0.1 mg/kg/inj) orfood (1 g banana-flavored pellets) under two schedules of reinforce-ment. Under one schedule, cocaine injections or food pellets were available under second-order schedule during alternating daily components, and the primary dependent variables were the numbersof injections and pellets delivered per day (maximum of 80 injec-tions and 100 food pellets). Under the other schedule, cocaine injections and food pellets were available simultaneously under a concurrent-choice schedule, and the primary dependent variableswere the % cocaine choices and overall number of choices. Mono-amine releasers were delivered by continuous infusion through one lumen of the double-lumen catheter for up to 28 consecutive days.Monoamine releasers varied in their selectivity for releasing dopamine vs. serotonin. Results: Under the second-order schedule, the cocaine dose-effect curve displayed an inverted-U shape with peak self-administrationrates at doses of 0.01-0.032 mg/kg/inj. Under the concurrent-choiceschedule, cocaine maintained a dose-dependent increase in cocaine choice, with peak levels of cocaine choice at doses of 0.032-0.1 mg/kg/ inj. Amphetamine produced a dose-dependent, selective and sustaineddecrease in cocaine self-administration under the second-orderschedule for periods up to 28-days. Tolerance developed within one week to any effects of amphetamine on food-maintained responding. Amphetamine also produced a dose-dependent decrease in cocainechoice and an increase in food choice under the concurrent-choiceschedule. Similarly selective effects were produced by other mono- amine releasers with DA vs. 5HT selectivity of 30- to 40-fold (e.g. phenmetrazine).Discussion: These findings suggest at least three general conclusions. First, in agreement with clinical and other preclinical findings with amphetamine, these results indicate that chronic amphetaminetreatment can produce sustained, selective and robust decreases incocaine self-administration in nonhuman primates. Second, com- pounds such as phenmetrazine, which have 30- to 40-fold selectivity for releasing DA vs. 5HT may be especially effective in producingselective reductions in cocaine self-administration. Finally, theseresults support the hypothesis that compounds such as amphetamine (metabolite of lisdexamphetamine) and phenmetrazine (metabolite of phendimetrazine) may be useful target metabolites for prodrug agonistmedications. Studies are underway to further examine conditions under which monoamine releasers may be optimally effective in combination with environmental manipulations.Disclosure: S.S.

Herin* Dept. of Psychiatry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN Background: Cocaine dependence remains a significant problem in the United States, with no universally-effective medications. Several approaches have been used to pursue pharmacotherapeutic agents totreat this disorder. One approach utilizes antagonist medications to block monoamine receptors and thus reduce the desired effects of cocaine. Preclinical and human laboratory studies have identifiedsome potential antagonist compounds for cocaine dependencetreatment, however clinical trials have generally found few changes or even increases in drug use. In contrast, substantial evidence supports the agonist-like ''replacement'' medication strategy. Thisapproach posits that medications with properties similar to the abuseddrug, but possessing lesser abuse liability, will normalize neurochem- istry and stabilize behavior, thus reducing drug use. Several agonist- like agents have been investigated including L-dopa/carbidopa,bupropion, modafinil, methylphenidate, and amphetamine analogues, with safety and some efficacy demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies. Of these medications, there is considerable promise foramphetamine analogues including sustained release (SR) d-ampheta-mine and methamphetamine. Additionally, recent advances in drug delivery technology have resulted in amphetamine prodrug prepara- tions with even greater abuse-resistant properties.Methods: First, the presentation will detail our published and recent data demonstrating reductions in cocaine use with d-amphet- amine SR (0, 30, 60 mg/day) plus cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Additionally, rationale for use of the prodrug Lisdexamfetamine(LDX) will be discussed, plus data from our current double-blind,placebo-controlled clinical study investigating changes in cocaine use with LDX (0, 70 mg/day) plus CBT. Further, a case study from a newS21 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencepilot trial utilizing greater doses of LDX (70-140 mg/day) will be presented. Results and Discussion: Collectively, these clinical data support the safety and efficacy of agonist-like medications such as d-amphetamineSR for treatment of cocaine dependence and suggest potential for thenovel prodrug medication LDX.

Fudge* University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NYBackground: The insula, or 'fifth' lobe of the primate brain, begins on the caudal orbital surface and extends caudally along the lateral surface of the brain. The insula is activated by intense emotional states, including experiences linked to emotional or physical pain, andpleasure. Gut sensations contribute to experiences ranging fromfullness/satiety to their emotional analogue, 'contentment'. Other visceral experiences include nausea, and its emotionally-laden analogue 'butterflies', or anxiety. Because the insula appears tointegrate visceral experience with emotional experience, we examinedthe anatomy of this system in Old world monkeys. Specifically, we asked how inputs from subcortical gustatory centers interfaces with inputs from the amygdala in the anterior insula. We then examinedoutput from the insula to the striatum, to understand how this information might modulate goal-directed behaviors such as food consumption.Methods: Injections of bidirectional tracers were placed in the insula and amygdala of Old World primates. We examined the distribution of labeled cells in the gustatory thalamus, and amygdala following insula injections, and projections from the amygdala to the insula. Wealso charted the distribution of afferently labeled fibers in the striatumresulting from insula tracer injections. Results: The anterior insula receives input from the amygdala and the 'gustatory thalamus' based on both anterograde and retrogradestudies. Both the and dysgranular insula receive inputs from the gustatory thalamus and the amygdala, and project to the 'limbic striatum', mainly in the ventromedial putamen.Conclusions: The interface between visceral information (from gustatory thalamus) and emotionally tagged external cues (from amygdala) occurs in the anterior insula. Emotional experiences that are colored by 'gut sensations' in the insula are transmitted to theventral striatum, specifically in the region of the ventromedialputamen. This pathway suggests a way that emotional associations can converge with taste and visceral sensations to influence ingestive behavior through striatal circuits.Disclosure: The Influence of Adiposity, Genotype and Phenotype on Caudate Response to Food in Humans Dana M. Small* The John B Pierce Laboratory and Yale University, New Haven, CT Background: In healthy weight humans the caudate nucleus responds during the consumption of palatable foods, and eating a favorite meal results in decreased [C 11]raclopride binding potential, thus implicating dopaminergic mechanisms in the human dorsal striatum in foodreward. In overweight individuals caudate response to milkshake is reduced and there is an inverse relationship between response and future weight gain. Moreover, both of these relationships depend upon genotype, with stronger associations observed for people who carryone or two copies of the taq IA A1 allele, which is associated withcompromised striatal dopamine signaling. What is unknown is 1) whether this response is associated with anhedonia, impulsivity, or eating style; 2) whether it is a better predictor of weight gain comparedto traditional (and less expensive) measures; and 3) whether itprecedes or follows weight gain. The aim of the current study was to address these questions. Methods: Perceptual ratings and fMRI BOLD response to the taste and smell of milkshake flavors and aromas was measured in 44 healthy andoverweight individuals (BMI range 19.2 to 42.3). Participants also completed several questionnaires assessing eating style, and impulsiv- ity, and completed a measure of food reinforcement. Neuroimagingdata were pre- and post-processed with SPM5 and 26 individuals returned one year later to have their body mass index (BMI) re- assessed.Results: Replicating prior work we found an inverse relationship between BMI and response in the caudate to milkshake (18, 15, 9; z\u00bc3.7; correlated p\u00bc0.008), but not with the milkshake pleasantness or intensity rating, food reinforcement, nor with any measure of eating style. Responsehere also predicted future weight gain and the strength of this relationship was stronger in A1 carriers (r \u00bc-.87 in carriers and -.45 in non carriers). Moreover, a stepwise regression analyses showed thatcaudate response was the best predictor (R 2\u00bc.24; p \u00bc0.04) of future weight gain (better than initial BMI, eating style, perceptual ratings, food reinforcement, and impulsivity). No differential caudateresponses were observed as a function of genotype or phenotype,when groups were matched for BMI. Discussion: These findings replicate prior work in showing a strong relationship between caudate response to milkshake and adiposity,especially in those who carry the A1 allele. The data also extend priorwork. First they show that caudate response is a better predictor of future weight gain than many traditional measures. Second, they show that response in the caudate is related to trait impulsivity, but not tofood reward or to eating style. Thus, the results do not support theconclusion that reduced caudate responses are associated with anhedonia. Finally, we show that the influence of the gene on caudate response is dependent on BMI, since no differential caudate effect isobserved in carriers vs. noncarriers who are matched for BMI. This suggests that the reduced caudate response results from an interaction of genotype and adiposity, which is in turn consistent with thepossibility that the response reflects a neural adaptation to increasedadiposity.

Savage* University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KSBackground: Obesity arises from chronic imbalances between energy intake and expenditure. Health-related decisions impacting energybalance are influenced by a convergence of processes in the brain, as individuals weigh the perceived balance between the rewarding and punishing aspects of behavioral choices, and whether gratification isimmediate or delayed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)studies are identifying brain mechanisms contributing to energy intake and expenditure in obese and healthy weight groups. Previous neuroimaging work in obesity has focused on food reward, but thereis no reason to believe that reward centers of the brain distinguish between reward types. This presentation will summarize findings from a previous fMRI study of food motivation and present new data examiningbrain processes underlying non-food (monetary) reward processing.S22 ACNP 49th Annual ConferenceMethods: The food motivation study used fMRI to examine brain activation in obese (n \u00bc10) and healthy weight (n \u00bc10) adults while they viewed food and nonfood images in pre-meal and post-meal states. Participants were scanned in two food motivation states (ordercounterbalanced): 1) Pre-Meal, after fasting at least 4 hours; and 2)Post-meal, immediately after eating a 500 Kcal meal. During scanning, visual images of food and nonfood stimuli were presented in counterbalanced blocks interspersed with blurred baseline images.The monetary reward study is ongoing and consists of presentation ofcues that predict the delivery of monetary reward or punishment with 75% probability. Following a short delay, obese (n \u00bc10 to date) and healthy weight (n \u00bc12 to date) participants receive feedback on how much they won or lost on each trial. This event-related design allowsseparation of brain responses during anticipation and delivery of monetary rewards and punishments. Groups in both studies were matched for age, handedness (all R), and sex and all fMRI data wereanalyzed using GLM analysis (random effects) through BrainVoyager. Results: In the food motivation study, obese participants showed increased activation, compared to HW participants, in anterior cingulatecortex (ACC) in the pre-meal condition, and medial prefrontal cortex(MPFC) in both conditions. Self-report of hunger were positively correlated with Pre-Meal MPFC activations. In the monetary reward study, both groups showed larger activations to anticipation ofreward (vs. punishment) in the striatum bilaterally (x,y,z \u00bc15,5,-2 and -12,5-2) and MPFC (-6,25,-2). Further, a region in ACC (0,11,25) showed greater response to anticipation of monetary reward in healthy weight controls and monetary punishment in obese participants.Discussion: Functional neuroimaging studies of food motivation show hyperactivation among obese in cortical regions rich in dopaminergic projections from ventral tegmental reward circuits, especially the medialprefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. These findings add togrowing evidence of increased sensitivity to food reward in obese groups. Preliminary findings using nonfood, monetary, rewards also show differences between obese and healthy weight groups, withevidence that ACC plays a differential role processing monetary rewardsand punishments in the two groups. Results from these studies will be discussed in the context of previous fMRI studies showing modified brain responses during reward processing in obese groups.Disclosure: C.R.

Insula Response to Sweet Taste and Anticipation of Food in Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa: Is Altered Sensory-Interoceptive Function aBiomarker That Reflects the Urge to Eat? Walter Kaye*, Tyson A. Oberndorfer, Guido Frank, Julie L. Fudge, Alan Simmons, Angela Wagner, Martin Paulus, Amanda Grethe University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CABackground: How are individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) able to consume a few hundred calories per day and maintain an extremelylow weight for many years, when most people struggle to lose a fewpounds? And why do individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN) binge on thousands of calories per day? Several lines of evidence suggest that pathological eating behaviors in AN and BN may be related to aberrant'top-down' neural processes that modulate the sensory, interoceptive, rewarding, and cognitive aspects of food ingestion. This circuit includes the anterior insula, as well as the amygdala, the ventralanterior Methods: In order to avoid the confounding effects of malnutrition, female subjects that were recovered from AN (RAN) and BN (RBN)were compared to healthy control women (CW). Functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine (1) response to tastes of sucrose (1 cc 10% solution) vs an artificial sweetener and (2) response to pictures of palatable foods vs color-matched neutralobjects.Results: Study 1: A significant group by condition difference was found in the superior sulcus of the right AI (F(2,51) \u00bc10.72, po0.001)masked by a priori regions of interest. A post hoc analysis showed sucrose elicited significantly decreased right AI activation in 14 RAN (p\u00bc0.01) and increased activation in 14 RBN (p \u00bc0.02) compared to 14 CW. Study 2: A whole brain group by condition ANOVA revealedone region of significant interaction in Brodmann's Area 13 rightanterior insula (p o0.001) (Volume: 1344 mL, XYZ \u00bc38,11,-8). This interaction was driven by greater insula activation in 14 RAN versus 12 CW while anticipating images of food (p o0.001), and by deactivation of the insula in RAN while anticipating images of neutral objects(p\u00bc0.015). Discussion: Study 1 suggests that individuals who undereat or overeat have an altered set-point, and/or altered sensitivity, when consumingsucrose that is neutrally represented in the AI as well as other relatedregions that modulate sensory-interoceptive-incentive signals. These findings replicate previous findings in RAN (Wagner 2008). Moreover other studies show obese subjects or obese binge eating subjects(Rothemund, 2007. Schienle, 2008, Stice, 2008, Stoeckel, 2008) tend to have increased insula activation in response to pictures or tastes of food. The AI plays a critical role in interoceptive awareness of internalbody states and, in concert with the overlying operculum and OFCrepresents the sensory experience of food in the brain. Thus, changes in food hunger, or other body states creates signals in the AI that drive behaviors that subsequently resolve the altered signal. The set-pointfor under-eaters may be biased toward a basal level of satiety(diminished AI signals), whereas the set-point for overeaters may be biased toward a basal level of hunger (increased AI signals). In study 2, increased right AI activation during anticipation may suggestamplified emotional reactivity to the upcoming 'aversive' interoceptive stimulus, similar to findings in pathological anxiety (Simmons, 2008, Simmons, 2006). These results support a model of ''interoceptivedisconnection'' between signals related to anticipating and consumingpalatable foods in AN. In theory, such a disconnect may reflect distorted reward based learning. Whether such disconnects occur in BN remain to be determined.Disclosure: W.H. 4; NIMH, Part 4; Price Foundation, Part 4. Panel Session Developmental Trajectories and Mechanisms Underlying the Phenotypic Risk for Anxiety and Depression: Cross SpeciesPerspectives from Infancy to Adolescence to Adulthood Developmental Differences in the Extinction of Learned Fear: Preclinical StudiesRick Richardson* University of New South Wales, Sydney NSW 2052, AustraliaBackground: Fear typically protects us from danger. However, an anxiety disorder emerges when fear becomes pervasive and interferes with normal functioning. The most utilized treatment for anxiety disorders is exposure-based therapy, which relies on the process ofextinction. Although preclinical research on the extinction of learned fear is a widely used model preparation for exposure-based therapy a conspicuous omission in this area of research has been the systematicstudy of extinction during early development.Methods: In all experiments, rats receive Pavlovian fear conditioning where a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an aversive shock unconditioned stimulus. Extinction involves repeatedly pre-senting the CS by itself, and leads to a loss of fear (i.e., as measured byfreezing). We have studied developmental differences in extinction of learned fear behaviorally, pharmacologically, and neurally, but in this talk I will focus on the pharmacological experiments. Rats wereinjected with MK-801 (Dizocilpine), a non-competitive antagonist ofthe NMDA receptor, prior to extinction to assess the role of NMDA in learning extinction or FG7142, a partial inverse agonist of theS23 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencebenzodiazepine receptor, prior to testing to assess the role of GABAergic inhibition in expression of extinction. Results: If extinction of learned fear occurs after the age of weaning (e.g., postnatal day 23), then both NMDA and GABA are criticallyinvolved, just like in adults. In contrast, if extinction occurs earlier inlife (i.e., prior to postnatal day 18) then neither NMDA nor GABA are involved. This pharmacological evidence supports the conclusion that there is a fundamentally different system mediating extinction early inlife. Additional studies show that the transition between these twoextinction systems occurs at younger ages in rats exposed to early life trauma (maternal separation). That is, NMDA and GABA are involved in extinction of learned fear early in life if the rats had experiencedearly life trauma. Finally, the adult extinction system is unstable duringadolescence (i.e., postnatal day 35), leading to marked impairments in extinction retention. Importantly, these deficits in extinction retention in adolescent rats can be alleviated by the partial NMDA receptoragonist D-Cycloserine (DCS). Discussion: Studies on extinction in immature animals have significant implications for elucidating the developmental neurobiology of anxietydisorders and may have significant implications for the developmentof effective treatments for anxiety disorders. Our results show that a fundamentally different system mediates extinction of learned fear early in life compared to later in life. The early extinction system isrelapse resistant and does not involve NMDA or GABA receptors. Incontrast, the later maturing extinction system critically relies on both NMDA and GABA receptors and is relapse prone. Further, the later maturing system is markedly impaired during adolescence, with ratsthis age exhibiting profound deficits in retaining extinction. This deficit, however, can be attenuated by injecting DCS at the time of extinction. Finally, preliminary data on maternally-separated ratssuggest that early life trauma causes a premature transition to the''adult type'' extinction system which may render individuals more vulnerable to relapse and chronic anxiety.

Kalin* University of Wisconsin, Department of Psychiatry, Madison, WIBackground: Studies in rhesus monkeys demonstrate a valid and reliable model to study the factors mediating the development ofanxious temperament and the risk to develop anxiety and depression. Methods: Phenotypic (anxious temperament) and functional brain data (FDG-PET) were collected from a large cohort of preadolescentmonkeys (n 4200) that belonged to a single multigenerational pedigree. A voxel wise analysis was performed examining the relation between individual differences in anxious temperament and glucose metabolic activity. Heritability analyses were performed on behavioraland functional brain data. Animals were also genotyped for theserotonin transporter polymorphism (short and long alleles). Results: Results demonstrated that metabolic activity in the CeA amygdala region and anterior hippocampus was predictive ofindividual differences in anxious temperament. Heritability analyses revealed that anxious temperament is significantly heritable as is threat-induced function in the anterior hippocampal region that ispredictive of anxious temperament. Interestingly, the CeA regionpredictive of anxious temperament was not significantly heritable. No significant effects of the serotonin transporter polymorphism on the phenotype or brain activity that was predictive of anxious tempera-ment were detected.Discussion: These results characterize the neural circuit associated with primate anxious temperament. The data further show differential heritability of metabolic activity in this circuit suggesting that anteriorhippocampus is more affected by heritable influences whereas the CeAappears to be more affected by environment. These data provide a frame work, at the neural circuit level, to test hypotheses regardingmechanisms underlying the interactive influences of genes and environment on the development of anxious temperament.

Impact of a Human Infant Phenotype on Brain Development and Function in Late Adolescence and Young Adulthood: The Circuitry ofAnxiety and Mood Carl Schwartz* Massachusetts General Hospital & Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA Background: One of the central thrusts of research in developmental psychopathology over the past 50 years has been the quest to identifyincreasingly early developmental markers of elevated risk for anxietyand depression, in the hope of improving primary and secondary prevention. Longitudinal studies provide a unique perspective on the development of circuitry mediating the regulation and dysregulation ofanxiety and mood. Methods: A single laboratory-based behavioral assessment of human infants at four months of age is described that identifies twocontrasting infant phenotypes. 135 subjects from this infant cohortwere studied at 18 years of age with high resolution structural MRI, three fMRI protocols, and diffusion tensor imaging. Results: We found alterations in brain structure and function, including patterns of connectivity, associated with these riskphenotypes. Both published and to-be published data will be presented that identifies variations in cortical architecture (including cingulate and prefrontal cortex) and volumetric differences in subcorticalstructures in circuits subsuming regulation of mood and anxiety.Variations in the patterns of cortical activation and connectivity revealed by the fMRI paradigms (affective facial perception, novelty facial perception and discrepancy) that are related to both infantphenotypes and gender will be detailed. Discussion: The footprint of these infant phenotypes in the brains of late adolescents and young adults brain provides insight into the originof individual differences in both baseline trait anxiety and the highincidence of anxiety and mood disorder in young adults. Unexpect- edly, several of these measures showed marked sex differences; analyses to date suggest that these differences are not hormonallymediated. Developmental mechanisms that might underlie thesetemperament and gender differences will be discussed. These phenotypes may represent one substrate for the individual differences that have been observed in fear learning, extinction learning, andextinction retention. Experimental approaches to further exploring and understanding these phenomena are outlined. Disclosure: C. Schwartz, None. Phenotypic Risk for Anxiety and Depression in Adolescence: Insights from Human Imaging to Mouse Genetics BJ Casey* Sackler Institute, New York, NY Background: Adolescence is often described as a period of intense and frequent negative emotions. This emotional dysregulation has been hypothesized to explain the increased rates of anxiety, depression andsuicide during this time of life. Yet for some teens, experiences duringthis period are unremarkable and they emerge from this period with a healthy, positive outcome. Findings from human imaging and mouse genetic studies are provided as examples of genetic factors thatenhance risk for psychopathology during this period of development.Methods: We used human functional imaging to examine responses to fear-related probes in 60 typically developing children, adolescentsS24 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceand adults. Second we examined parallel phenotypes in 68 mice and 72 humans resulting from a common single-nucleotide polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, implicated in emotional and anxiety-related behavior. We used an inbred geneticknock-in mouse strain expressing the variant BDNF that recapitulatedthe phenotypic effects of the human polymorphism. Results: Our normative developmental imaging data showed inflec- tions during adolescence in the amygdala relative to the ventromedialprefrontal cortex in response to fear related probes, not observed inpre- and post-adolescence. Our genetic data showed that both mice and humans with the BDNF variant were impaired in extinguishing a conditioned fear response, which was paralleled by atypical frontoa-mygdala activity in humans.Conclusions: Together, these studies provide converging methods for understanding the highly variable positive and negative experiences of adolescence and factors that may increase the risk for anxiety anddepression during this period of life. Each of these approaches (behavioral genetics, imaging genetics and mouse models of behavior) alone provides limited information on gene function in complexhuman behavior, but together, they are forming bridges betweenanimal models and human psychiatric disorders. Moreover, our findings have implications for the efficacy of treatments that rely on extinction mechanisms such as exposure therapy in treatment ofanxiety.Disclosure: B. Casey, None. Panel Session Discovery of Small Molecules for Research on Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Target Validation and Drug Discovery Compound Screening for Small Molecule Modulators of the Transcription Factor, DFosB Eric Nestler* Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY Depression remains one of the leading causes of morbidity worldwide. Although there are many effective treatments for depression, more than half of all depressed patients today are incompletely treated with available approaches. Data from our animal models now providesubstantial support for the view that stress induction of Delta-FosB represents a positive, adaptive mechanism that helps an animal cope with stress. First, Delta-FosB induction in several brain regions inresponse to chronic stress correlates with animals that are relativelyresistant (or resilient) to deleterious effects of the stress. This has been documented in both the learned helplessness and chronic social defeat stress paradigms. Second, using viral-mediated gene transfer andinducible and brain region-specific bitransgenic mouse models, wehave shown that overexpression of Delta-FosB in nucleus accumbens or in periaqueductal gray is sufficient to render animals resistant to subsequent stress and to reverse behavioral abnormalities induced bychronic stress. Studies of other brain regions are currently underway. Third, and conversely, overexpression of a dominant negative antagonist of Delta-FosB (termed Delta-cJun or -JunD) in these brainregions makes animals more vulnerable to the deleterious effects ofchronic stress. Fourth, we have found that chronic administration of standard antidepressant medications (e.g., fluoxetine, imipramine) also induces Delta-FosB in most of these same brain regions, and thatoverexpression of the dominant negative antagonists of Delta-FosBblock the antidepressant-like behavioral effects of these medications in several behavioral assays, including social defeat. Fifth, in collabora- tion with Carol Tamminga (UT Southwestern), we have demonstratedthat depressed humans have lower levels of Delta-FosB in the nucleus accumbens compared to extensively matched control subjects. The availability of high affinity, small molecule ligands for Delta-FosBcould potentially be used for clinical investigations in depression andperhaps as a novel tool to diagnose depression or other stress-related disorders or track a patient's progress during treatment. This presentation will report the progress made in the identification of small molecule modulators of Delta-FosB in collaboration withDr. Gabby Rudenko (U Michigan).Disclosure: E.J. Nestler, None. Chemical Genomic Studies of the Role of Wnt/GSK-3 Signaling in Neuropsychiatric Disease Stephen J. Haggarty* Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA Background: Wnt/GSK-3 signaling plays a fundamental role in CNS through the regulation of diverse processes ranging from neurogenesis to behaviors relevant to cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders.Our recent studies have shown a direct interaction of schizophrenia risk gene Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) with GSK-3 and its regulation of b-catenin-dependent neurogenesis and mood-related behavioral response in mice. Additionally, previous biochemical,cellular, and behavioral findings have implicated a role for direct and indirect inhibition of GSK-3 signaling by mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. However, the molecular natureof mechanisms and the downstream consequences of GSK-3 inhibition,including the relevance of altered synaptic and transcriptional effects, remain poorly understood. Methods: With the long-term goal of gaining insight the function of disease-associated genetic variation and developing novel small- molecule probes to target Wnt/GSK-3 signaling in the CNS, we have developed a panel of biochemical and cell-based assays that arecapable of supporting high-throughput small molecule and RNAiscreens. Results: Preliminary results from the use of this panel of assays to identify and characterize novel inhibitors of GSK-3 and to identify newtargets within the Wnt/GSK-3 pathway will be presented. We will alsodiscuss advances in the use of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that now enable probing of Wnt/GSK-3 signaling in a human neurodevelopmental context using small-molecules and func-tional genomic approaches.Discussion: Genetic and pharmacological findings suggest that dysregulation of Wnt/GSK-3 signaling may play an important role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. The small-mole-cule probes we are developing will provide a means to better understand the cellular and circuit level consequences of altering Wnt/GSK-3 signaling in the CNS and may provide new avenues fortherapeutic development. Discovery of Novel Allosteric Modulators Muscarinic Receptors for Treatment of CNS Disorders Jeffrey Conn* Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN Background: Previous animal and clinical studies with suggest that agonists of the M1 and/or M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes may provide a novel approach to treatment ofschizophrenia and may provide efficacy in enhancing cognitivefunction. In addition, the M5 mAChR has been implicated in regulating firing of midbrain dopamine neurons and may provide a potential target for treatment of a range of CNS disorders, includingschizophrenia, ADHD, and addictive disorders. Unfortunately, pre-vious attempts to develop highly selective antagonists or agonists of individual mAChR subtypes have failed to achieve high selectivity for a single mAChR subtype. Previous ligands also have activity at M2 andM3, which leads to adverse effects that have prevented full develop- ment and marketing of mAChR agonists. Failure to develop selective traditional (orthosteric) ligands of individual mAChR subtypes islikely due to the fact that the ACh binding site is highly conserved.S25 ACNP 49th Annual ConferenceWe have taken a novel approach to develop highly selective antagonists and activators of M1, M4, and M5 by targeting allosteric sites on the receptor rather than developing agents that act as traditional orthosteric agonists.Results: We have used a combination of high throughput screening and technology-enabled medicinal chemistry approaches to discover novel compounds that are highly selective as allosteric agonists or positive allosteric modulators of M1, have no selective allosteric activators of M1include allosteric directly activate the receptor, and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). These latter compounds do not activate M1 when added alone but potentiate the response toacetylcholine (ACh) or other orthosteric agonists. For M4 and M5,we have focused exclusively on PAMs. Interestingly, these mAChR PAMs have no detectable affinity at the orthosteric binding site but increase the affinity of ACh. In addition, our data suggest that the M4potentiators also increase coupling of the receptor to GTP-binding proteins. We have now optimized allosteric activators of both M1 and M4 to a point at which they have robust CNS activity and allowsystemic administration for in vivo studies. Interestingly, both M1 and M4-selective compounds have robust electrophysiological effects in limbic and forebrain regions that provide important new insights into the respective roles of these two mAChR subtypes. In addition, bothM1 and M4 PAMs have efficacy in animal models that predict bothantipsychotic and cognition-enhancing efficacy. However, M1 and M4 PAMs have distinct profiles across animal models. We are now assessing the effects of M5 PAMs in regulating dopamine cell firing.Discussion: These studies provide an exciting advance in demonstrat- ing a novel approach to development of small molecule ligands that are highly selective for individual mAChR subtypes and suggest thatselective allosteric activators of M1 and/or M4 may provide a novelapproach to treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that lead to impaired cognitive function. It will be important to fully characterize the in vivo effects of these compounds to help establish the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to different behavioral effectsof non-selective mAChR agonists.

New Molecular Targets for Neuropsychiatric Drug Discovery Bryan L. Roth* University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC Background: The 'druggable genome', defined as ''the genes in the human genome that express proteins able to bind drug-like molecules'' (Hopkins and Groom, Nature Rev Drug Discv 2002), is thought tocontain 2000-3000 molecular targets. At most, 5% of the druggable genome has been exploited for the purposes of psychiatric drug discovery (Roth et al, Nature Rev Drug Discov 2004; Allan and Roth,Ann Rev Pharmacol, in press) leaving a vast universe of potentialmolecular targets for neuropsychiatric drug discovery. In this talk, I will highlight how our integrated chemical biology approach facilitates the discovery of new molecular targets for neuropsychiatric drugdiscovery.Methods: We utilize both cheminformatics and physical screening approaches (see for instance Keiser et al, Nature 2009) to identify drug targets on a 'druggable genome'-wide fashion. Newly createdtechnologies suitable for screening the entire druggable GPCR-ome(which represents 360 + molecular targets) in a massively parallel fashion will also be highlighted.Results: I will first present new findings related to antipsychotic drug discovery. In this first portion of the talk I will show results from a screen of more than 2500 distinct molecular targets in an effort to uncover new molecular targets for atypical antipsychotic drugdiscovery. I then show how we validated a family of targets using abattery of antipsychotic drug behavioral tests in wild-type and selected knock-out mice. Next I will present new and currently unpublished findings showing how our integrated chemical biology approach hasfacilitated the discovery of new targets for neuropsychiatric drugs. Forthis second part of my talk I will show how a dedicated screen of the orphan GPCR-ome has revealed the hidden pharmacology of neuropsychiatric drugs. None of the findings that I will present havebeen published at the time of abstract submission.Discussion: These results validate the unbiased chemical biology approach for the discovery and validation of new molecular targets for neuropsychiatric drug discovery.Disclosure: B.L.

Panel Session Dissecting the Heterogeneity of Treatment Response in First Episode Schizophrenia Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Second-Generation Antipsychotic Drugs in First Episode SchizophreniaStefan Leucht* Technische Universitat Hospital, Munich, GermanyBackground: The first episode of schizophrenia is a critical phase of the illness. It has been claimed that second-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGA) should be preferred for the treatment of first episode patients to allow for a soft first contact with treatment by avoiding thedisturbing extrapyramidal side-effects of first-generation antipsychoticdrugs (FGA), or parkinsonism. However, in a Cochrane review published in 2003 we identified only 2 randomised controlled trials that compared risperidone and olanza-pine with haloperidol in first episode schizophrenia, but did not find any clear superiority (Rummel et al. 2003). As since then a number of further studies have been published, we will present an update of theearlier meta-analysis.Methods: We produced meta-analyses of randomized controlled studies that compared SGAs with placebo, with FGAs or SGAs with SGAs head-to-head in first-episode schizophrenia. The trials wereselected from update searches made for our systematic reviews thathad included any participants with schizophrenia irrespective of the number of episodes (Leucht et al. 2009a,b,c). The results of the single studies will be combined in meta-analyses using relative risksfor dichotomous outcomes and standardized mean differences (Hedges's g) for continuous outcomes as effect size measures, all calculations based on a random effects model.Results: According to a preliminary analysis eight further RCTs from Western countries that compared SGAs with FGAs and five studies that compared SGAs head-to-head have been published. This much larger dataset now allows for a more thorough investigation ofefficacy and tolerability differences between these compounds. Wewill present data on overall efficacy (PANSS/BPRS total score), trial discontinuation, positive and negative symptoms, EPS and weight gain.Discussion: The meta-analysis will present the up-to-date randomized- trial evidence on the effects of second-generation antipsychotic in first episode S.

The promptidentification of responders/non-responders will help to provide optimal services to this group of patients, which will have a major impact on long term outcome.Methods: Close to 500 patients with a first episode of schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective disorder were studied in the European First Episode in Schizophrenia Trial (EUFEST) (Kahn et al.,2008). About one third of the investigated patients were naive toantipsychotics. All cause discontinuation, defined as loss of retention on treatment, was the primary outcome variable of this clinical trial, in which the effectiveness of 4 new generation antipsychotics (amisul-pride, quetiapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone) was compared to that of alow dose of haloperidol over a one year period. Next to other secondary outcome variables the study sample was investigated with respect to factors predicting treatment response and remission.Results: Patients initially randomized to haloperidol met the primary outcome criterion significantly more often than those treated with any of the newer antipsychotics. Treatment adherence and higher PANSStotal scores at baseline were positive predictors of response andremission, while akathisia, male gender and concurrent substance abuse proved to be negative predictors (Boter et al. 2009). In addition, a positive attitude towards treatment, as measured with the DrugAttitude Inventory, predicted retainment in the study (Gaebel et al.2010). These results were generally upheld when restricting statistical analyses to the subsample of patients which had not been pretreated with antipsychotics.Discussion: These analyses provide clinical guidance for the treatment of patients suffering from a first episode of psychosis.

Predictors Outcome in Schizophrenia: Neuroanatomical and Symptomatic Rudolf Magnus Institute of Neuroscience, Utrecht, NetherlandsBackground: Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disease and so is its outcome. It is clear that even early in the disease a large number of subjects does not respond satisfactorily and a majority goes on to experience frequent relapses anyhow. Despite several decades ofresearch no clear markers have been found that predict outcome.Methods: In a large dataset of over 4,000 subjects, including patients with schizophrenia, their siblings and healthy subjects, all assessed with the same diagnostic instrument (Comprehensive Assessment ofSymptoms and History, CASH) a combination of latent class analysis and factor analysis was used to delineate subgroups. Results: Consistent with the literature several subgroups were found of which one group, closely resembling the original depiction ofschizophrenia by Kraepelin and characterized by psychotic, disorga- nized and negative symptoms were delineated. This ''Kraepelinian'' group was also characterized by significantly lower IQ than the other 4subgroups. Most interestingly, it was this group of patients thatshowed the largest decline in brain volume over time. Conclusion: This study was able to delineate a subgroup of schizophrenia patients characterized by the core-symptoms ofschizophrenia as described by Kraepelin i.e. cognitive decline, disorganization, positive and negative symptoms. These patients showed, as has been predicted by previous studies, the poorestoutcome. Moreover, it was this subgroup of patients that showed thelargest brain volumes over a five year follow-up period. This study therefore suggests that the subgroup of schizophrenia characterized by lower IQ, disorganized symptoms and brain loss over time can bedelineated. It may be this subgroup that forms the core of theschizophrenic illness and may show specific genetic characteristics. Disclosure: R.S. Lilly, Johnson&Johnson, Astra-Zeneca, Otsuka, Dainippur, GSK, in First Episode SchizophreniaAnil Malhotra* The Zucker Hillside Hospital, Glen Oaks, NYBackground: Pharmacogenomic studies of first episode schizophrenia may provide a novel means to identify biological predictors ofantipsychotic drug response. In particular, the lack of substantial prior treatment histories may enhance genetic studies of side effects associated with treatment, in which prior treatment may confoundprecise phenotype-genotype relationships. Moreover, first episode cohorts more closely approximate the full range of potential response characteristics, as compared to chronic patient cohorts in may bebiased towards less responsive and side-effect prone subjects.Methods: We have conducted a pharmacogenetic study of over 100 first episode schizophrenia subjects enrolled in a comprehensive clinical trials of the second generation antipsychotics, olanzapine andrisperidone, as well as a meta-analysis of over 700 patients treated withantipsychotics. Moreover, we have conducted a genome-wide associa- tion (GWAS) study of a large cohort of antipsychotic-naive children and adolescent patients undergoing their initial antipsychotic drugtreatment.Results: Candidate gene analysis of the first episode cohort revealed that the dopamine DRD2 receptor -141C risperidone, a result extended by meta-analytic results suggesting an overall effect that was more pronounced in first episode subjects. Moreover, the same polymorphism was associated with weight gain in the firstepisode cohort, such that patients with the Del allele were less likely toclinically respond and more likely to gain weight than Ins/Ins subjects, regardless of antipsychotic drug and/or dosage. Finally, preliminary GWAS results in the antipsychotic-naive cohort are consistent withthese results, as well as indicate a new genome-wide significant resultin a gene linked to obesity in the general population. Discussion: Candidate gene, GWAS, and meta-analytic strategies each provide evidence for association of the DRD2 gene with antipsychoticdrug response and antipsychotic drug-induced weight gain. Moreover,GWAS results reveal a potential new locus associated with substantial weight gain in patients undergoing their first antipsychotic drug treatment.Disclosure: A.

Panel Session Habenula Session 2: Role of the Habenula in Addiction and Depression: Worse than Expected The Anatomical Connections of the Habenular Nuclei, with a Historical PerspectiveMiles Herkenham* National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MDBackground: The medial and lateral habenular nuclei are two paired, phylogenetically conserved structures lying at the top of the thalamus. They and the pineal gland are embryologically derived from the epithalamus. vertebrates, the pineal and the medial habenula in astriking asymmetric fashion and deliver information about solar radiation to endocrine and behavioral centers controlling basking behavior. In mammals, major afferent habenular inputs are from the ''limbic midbrain in got itsname from the fact that largely ventrally disposed sources of inputs relay descending limbic influences to the midbrain limbic area after taking a detour to the dorsal side of the thalamus.Methods: Historically, classical silver and Golgi stains have provided details of highly conserved and distinctive unusual architecture. Tract- tracing methods showed that the medial and lateral nuclei have precise inputs and outputs. Histochemical and molecular markers haveshown striking neurochemical specificity and subnuclear compart-mentalization. Results: The habenular nuclei provide segregated and precise from septal and diencephalic limbic areas to paramedian midbrainlimbic areas. The medial habenula is dominated by septal inputs and projects almost exclusively to the interpeduncular nucleus. Its rigid anatomy is starkly contrasted by the plethora of unusually andsometimes nearly uniquely expressed genes in this nucleus, suggestingthat isolated forms of molecular evolution occur in this otherwise highly conserved structure. The lateral habenula has the striking property of integrating inputs from limbic (hypothalamic) and basalganglia (pallidal) sources. It in turn relays these inputs to theparamedian midbrain, notably the serotonergic dorsal tegmental area lateral and substantia nigra pars compacta, but this directprojection is light compared to the strong projection relayed to the tegmental dopamine areas via the RMTg.Discussion: By these connections, convergent limbic and basal ganglia inputs can influence the major serotonergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic centers of the midbrain. The lateral habenula especially strongly controls the physiological properties of neurons in both theserotonin and dopaminergic nuclei of the tegmentum. These connec-tions form the basis for the unique functional properties of the habenula described in the Panel. Disclosure: M. Herkenham, None. ''You Can't Always Like What You Want'' - Role of the Lateral Habenula in the Encoding of Motivational Salience Paul Shepard* Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, Baltimore, MD Background: Projections from the lateral habenula (LHb) to the ventral midbrain and reticular formation provide an important source of inhibitory control over dopamine and serotonin neurons, respec-tively. Transient increases in LHb activity are associated with phasic decreases in DA cell firing elicited by the unanticipated absence of an expected reward. LHb neurons also respond to direct nociceptivestimulation and thus appear to encode the motivational value of avariety of aversive stimuli. Sustained increases in LHb activity are associated with reduced brain serotonin levels and the emergence of depressive mood and behavior in humans and in animal models ofmajor depressive disorder.Methods: This presentation will review recent advances in our understanding of the habenula-mesencephalic pathway and its role in functional modulation of monoaminergic neurons with an emphasison dopamine-containing neurons.Results: Electrophysiological studies ha ve shown that stimulation of the lateral habenula is capable of suppressing the activity of dopamine and serotonin neurons at a population lev el. The powerful inhibitory effects exerted by the LHb on DA neurons will be contrasted with the relatively sparse innervation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) by The role of GABA neurons in mediating theinhibitory effects of LHb activation on DA neurons will also be discussed with an emphasis on recent data suggesting that a newly identified brain region, the rostromedial tegmental n ucleus, serves as the principal target of LHb efferents and the source of feed-forward inhibition of DA cellactivity. A novel circuit will be proposed that offers a potential explanation for the predominantly inhibitory response of midbrain DA neurons to aversive stimuli as well as the paradoxical excitation elicited by identical stimuli in a subpo pulation of VTA DA neurons. Conclusions: Having only recently emerged from relative obscurity, the habenula and its connections with monoaminergic and GABAergic neurons are providing new insights into the circuitry responsible forencoding motivational salience. These perspectives have provided anew conceptual framework for understanding the basis of clinical syndromes ranging from major depressive disorder to cue-induced relapse of drug seeking behavior.Disclosure: P. Shepard, None. The Habenula as a Target of Deep Brain Stimulation for the Treatment of DepressionFritz Henn* Brookhaven National Laboratories, Upton, NYWe have used an animal model of depression, learned helplessness; to attempt to define the circuit mediating helplessness, determine thecellular basis underlying these circuit changes and the pathology leading to these changes and treatment approaches to the circuit dysfunction. Once this was established we have begun translationalstudies in man. Using the learned helpless model two rat lines werecreated by selectively breeding rats either sensitive or resistant to helplessness training selectively with one another. After over 60 generations the helpless line has the characteristics of a treatmentS28 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceresistant depression not responding to normal antidepressants or ECT, while the non helpless line is resistant to the effects of uncontrollable stress. Using micro PET we determined differences in baseline metabolic rates between the strains. This pointed to an area in themedial thalamus including the habenula as overactive and suggestedthe VTA was underactive. Electrophysiological studies showed the l. habenula was 15 fold more active in the helpless line and these cells project in part to the VTA inhibiting DA release. We will showpreliminary evidence that the l. habenula appears to receive increasedglutaminergic input driving the over activity, and that this may be on the basis of astrocytic dysfunction. Using the helpless line we investigated the effects of bilateral deep brain stimulation. We showedthat DBS resulted in depressed cellular activity and an improvement inthe helplessness. Opticogenetic studies are underway to define the exact mechanism of the cell silencing. To determine if the changes seen in the animal model applied to human depression we looked at brainchanges in patients subjected to tryptophan depletion (Roiser et al 2009). This revealed activation of the habenula, confirming an earlier PET study by Morris et al (1999). Finally we have utilized DBS in apatient with a long history of treatment resistant depression(Sartorious et al 2010). This resulted in a full recovery which reverses within 24 hours when the stimulator is off. These data suggest that the l. habenula, which receives cortical and limbic input, has strongreciprocal connections with the hypothalamus and alters the activity inthe midbrain nuclei, including the VTA, DRN and LC, may be a critical point in the circuit mediating major depression.

Functional Role of the Habenula and Nicotine Addiction: From Mice to MenRamiro Baldwin, Mariella De Biasi, P Read Montague Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TXBackground: Nicotine, the main addictive component of tobacco, acts at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain. There is anenormous variety of nAChRs and through pharmacological and genetic experiments in mice, we have shown that although b2 subunit-containing receptors are important for the rewarding effectsof nicotine, receptors comprising the b4,a5 and a2 subunits mediate withdrawal symptoms. These subunits are highly expressed in the habenula (Hb) and one of its major targets, the interpeduncular nucleus (ipn), and we next showed that blocking cholinergic activity inthe Hb or the ipn can precipitate withdrawal in nicotine-treated mice. Genome-wide association studies showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the b4,a5 and a3 nAChRs are important mediators of tobacco addiction risk in humans. In monkeys, the Hb has beenshown to signal negative reward prediction errors: when habenular cells activate due to the non-delivery of expected reward, dopamine cells shut down. In addition, upon unexpected reward, habenular cellsshowed small decreases while dopaminergic cells showed largeincreases in activity. Methods: We studied habenular activation during negative prediction errors using fMRI in humans. In humans, the habenula's extremelysmall size has prevented direct assessments of its function. We developed a method to functionally locate and study the habenula in humans using fMRI, based on the expected reward-dependentresponse phenomenology of habenula and striatum. Broadly, the logicof our approach had two basic components: (1) Identify habenular voxels by seeking anti-correlations with striatal responses to unexpected reward delivery during early conditioning. This identifiesthe habenula using a small negative-going BOLD response in specificvoxels contained in a region large enough to contain the habenula. (2) In a separate session, probe the habenular voxels using the unexpected non-delivery of reward. In addition, to be able to image such a smallarea, we used a large number of subjects (50), a manual co-registrationtechnique, and avoided pre-processing steps such as smoothing and normalization to a template brain.Results: We provide conclusive evidence for activation in human habenula to negative reward prediction errors. When expected reward was delivered with a 4 second delay, striatal activity decreased while habenular activity significantly increased. Once reward was finallydelivered, striatal activity markedly increased, while habenular activityreturned to basal levels. We are currently repeating this experiment in non-smokers and in sated and abstinent smokers. Discussion: We have shown that by using a large number of subjects, small voxel size and a manual coregistration technique coupled to acorrelational approach to identify the habenula, we can assess the activity of the habenula in humans undergoing a passive learning task. Our approach may provide a way to image activity in analogouslysmall brain structures, given that activity in those areas correlates in asystematic fashion with large easier-to-image brain regions.

Panel Session New Functional Insights into Sleep and Their Implications for Psychiatry Dynamics of Human Neurobehavioral Functions During Chronic Sleep Restriction and Recovery: Critical Contributions from Sleep Duration, Slow Wave Sleep Homeostasis, and Phenotypic VulnerabilityMathias Basner* University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PABackground: The daily integrity of waking neurobehavioral functions (cognitive, physiological, and subjective) depends on sleep. However,most studies this relationship have involved acute total sleep deprivation, instead of chronic partial sleep deprivation, which is what modern humans commonly experienced through life style andpathologies. Therefore what is known about sleep-wake dynamics isbased largely on acute or short time constants in sleep neurobiological processes mediating wake neurobehavioral functions. This has led to the view that sleep responds to deprivation by intensification ofnonREM slow wave activity (the putative marker of sleep home-ostasis), and the assumption that as long as slow wave activity intensifies, neurobehavioral functions can be recovered more quickly than they are diminished by sleep loss.Methods: For the past 15 years we have studied longer time cons- tants in human sleep-wake dynamics by systematically investi- gating the dose-response effects of repeated days of chronic sleeprestriction on accumulation of neurobehavioral deficits, and therecovery of these functions. Thus far, our experiments have involved more than 500 healthy adults (21-50y; 50% female; 50% minorities) continuously monitored physiologically and behaviorally in a medi-cally secure, environmentally controlled laboratory, and evaluatedlongitudinally on a range of neurobehavioral functions during 9 experiments involving randomization to sleep dose (for a total of 47,500 days). Results: These experiments have established that chronic restriction of sleep results in neurobehavioral deficits in cognitive processes involving attention, perception and memory that escalate (1) at a rateinversely proportional to the dose of sleep provided, and (2) as afunction of the chronicity of the restriction. NonREM slow wave responses_the putative marker of sleep homeostasis_were less marked under chronic sleep restriction than total sleep deprivation, but slowwave energy in the sleep EEG had a strong relationship with theextension of sleep duration during recovery from chronic sleep restriction. It also appeared to be critical for the recovery of speed of cognitive throughout. Our experiments also identified markedinter-individual differences (i.e., differential vulnerability) to theneurobehavioral effects of chronic sleep restriction within those healthy adults who habitually sleep 6.5-8.5 h per night. While theS29 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencemajority of healthy adults developed cumulative cognitive deficits, with some manifesting very rapid and severe deficits in response to chronic sleep restriction, a subset manifested no deficits as sleep loss progressed. We have investigated the neural basis of these phenotypicresponses using fMRI and by examining variability in geneticpolymorphisms known to be involved in regulation of arousal. Discussion: This body of work has demonstrated longer time constants are present in the neurobehavioral manifestations of sleep-wakedynamics, and that slow wave sleep energy has a role in apparentrecovery from chronic sleep restriction, but the basis of the phenotypic differences in neurobehavioral responses to chronic sleep restriction are not yet understood.Disclosure: F.

Sleep Disturbances in Psychiatric Illness: Metabolic Implications Eve Van Cauter* University of Chicago, Chicago, ILBackground: Reduced sleep duration and quality are nearly universal correlates of psychiatric illness.Methods: Healthy normal subjects are submitted to experimental manipulations of sleep duration (bedtime restriction) or sleep quality (selective suppression of deep slow-wave sleep) for 3-4 days under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, mimicking the sleepdisturbances of psychiatric illness. State of the art metabolic measuresincluding total body insulin sensitivity and insulin action at the level of the adipocyte are assessed. Results: Both total body insulin sensitivity and insulin signaling in peripheral adipocytes are impaired b y reduced sleep duration or quality. Conclusions: Sleep disturbances in psychiatric illness are likely to be associated with metabolic disturbances that are evident in peripheral molecular signaling pathways.Disclosure: E. van Cauter, None. Sleep and Brain Energy Levels: ATP Changes During Sleep and the Role of Nitric Oxide in SleepRobert McCarley* Harvard/VAMC, Brockton, MASleep is one of the most pervasive biological phenomena, but one whose function remains elusive. Although many theories of function,indirect evidence, and even commonsense suggest sleep is needed for an increase in brain energy, brain energy levels have not been directly measured with modern technology. Our previous extensive researchshowing an increase in adenosine during wake, acting to inhibit wake-active neurons, suggested that the increase in adenosine might be a result of utilization of Adenosine TriPhosphate (ATP) in waking neuronal activity. As ATP is utilized, a chain of coupled reactionswould lead to an increase in intracellular adenosine, which would be transported across the membrane by equilibrative transporters, leading to feedback inhibition on the wake active cells. These dataprompted us to examine directly ATP levels during sleep and wake.Using a validated luciferin - luciferase ATP assay and rapid regional brain dissections and freezing in rat, we here report that ATP levels, the energy currency of brain cells, show a surge in the initial hours ofspontaneous sleep in wake-active brain regions of frontal and cingulatecortex, hippocampus and basal forebrain. This surge does not occur in the sleep-active brain region of ventrolateral preoptic hypothalamus. The surge is dependent on sleep but not time of day, since preventingsleep by gentle handling of rats for 3 h or 6 h also prevents the surge in ATP. A significant positive correlation was observed between the surge in ATP and EEG NREM slow wave sleep (delta activity, 0.5-4.5 Hz)during spontaneous sleep. Inducing sleep and SWS (delta activity)by adenosine infusion into basal forebrain during the normally active dark period also increases ATP. Taken together, these observations suggest that the surge in ATP occurs when the neuronalactivity is reduced, as occurs during sleep. The levels of phosphory- lated AMP-activated protein kinase (P-AMPK), well known for its role in cellular energy sensing and regulation, and ATP show reciprocal changes. P-AMPK levels are lower during the sleep-induced ATP surgethan during wake or sleep deprivation. These results suggest thatsleep-induced surge in ATP and the decrease in P-AMPK levels set the stage for increased anabolic processes during sleep and provides insight into the molecular events leading to the restorative biosyntheticprocesses occurring during sleep. This would be consistent withrecent findings on the necessary role of sleep in memory consolidation, synaptic plasticity and remodeling, including an increase in the transcription of genes involved in protein synthesis and synapticplasticity. Our data significantly recast the old speculation that sleepis for energy restoration. We now restate the energy hypothesis as ''sleep is for an energy surge'', an ATP surge that nourishes the anabolic, restorative biosynthetic processes occurring during sleep.We then looked further into mechanisms leading to adenosine production during sleep, focusing on the role of the gaseous neuromodulator, nitric oxide (NO). We developed a novel assay forcellular NO, DAF, a dye taken up by cells and, in the presence of NO,became fluorescent and was trapped in the cell, allowing precise measurement of NO. Our studies indicate that forced wakefulness activated NO as part of the sleep homeostatic cascade and that NOpromoted recovery sleep following sleep deprivation by the productionof adenosine.

Optogenetic Control of Sleep and Waking Luis De Lecea* Stanford, Palo Alto, CABackground: The hypocretins (Hcrts), also known as orexins, are two neuropeptides produced by a few thousand neurons in the lateralhypothalamus. Genetic studies have demonstrated that Hcrt functionis necessary for wake stability, as lack of function leads to narcolepsy. Here we have tested whether Hcrt activity is sufficient to promote arousal stability by manipulating the activity of the Hcrt system usingoptogenetics.Methods: We targeted Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a activity over 5 Hz dramatically increases the probability of behavioral state transitions. Using the same optogenetic strategy we developed a novel method to fragment sleep without compro-mising total sleep amounts. We transduced Hcrt neurons in C57Bl/6mice using a Hcrt::ChR2-YFP or control Hcrt::YFP lentivirus. We induced micro-fragmentation of sleep by delivering trains of light pulses 10 sec at 20 Hz using a blue laser diode (20 mW;477 nm) using three different protocols: 30, 60 or 120 sec intervals over4 h during the light phase. We used Novel Object Recognition (NOR) task to study the effects of sleep on memory consolidation in rodents.Results: We found that all stimulation protocols significantly increased the frequency of transitions from sleep (non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement REM) to wake and shortened NREMsleep episodes. The mean NREM sleep episode in the control animalswas 62 + /-2.9 sec. In the 30 sec, 60 sec, and 120 sec stimulation protocols, NREM sleep episode durations were 34 \u00bc+ /-2.8 sec, 38 + /- 3.5 sec, and 45 + /-4.3 sec respectively. Rapid eye movement (REM)sleep was not significantly affected. Immediately after the trainingsession mice were stimulated for 4 h in different intervals. We found that stimulations every 60 sec resulted in a significant reduction in the performance on the test session 24 h later. Stimulation at a longerinterval, every 120 sec did not affect the performance. These effectswere further validated by the use of more frequent stimulation protocol (30 sec intervals), which impaired memory performance andS30 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencea more spares stimulation protocol (240 sec intervals) that did not affect the performance. Sleep fragmentation by gentle handling every 60 sec also impaired performance on the NOR task. Discussion: Our data reveal a minimal quantum of uninterrupted sleep required for memory consolidation Optogenetic methods allow us todemonstrate a prominent role for the hypocretinergic system in orchestrating arousal circuits and in cognitive function with un- precedented temporal precision.Disclosure: L. de Lecea, None. Panel Session Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Depression from CellularMechanisms to Clinical Care Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids in Depression and Illnesses John M. Davis*, Joseph R. Hibbeln, Brian P. Hallahan University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, NIAAA, Rockville, MD, National University of Ireland Galway, Galwa, Ireland Since omega-3 fatty acids are essential fatty acids (EFA) that cannot be synthesized to a large degree in the body from other dietary substance,the limiting factor in determining tissue concentrations is the amountof omega-3 fatty acids in the diet. Omega-3 and omega-6 are both constituents of many tissues and, in some sense, compete for incorporation into tissue. In the last 100 years or so, there has beena large increase in the dietary consumption of the omega-6 fatty acidsdue to alteration of farming and animal feed. The increase in the incidence of depression over these years parallels the increase of omega-6, so that much more omega-6 is consumed relative to omega-3EFA's. Hence, an omega-3 EFA dietary deficit may be a risk factor for depression. We will present a meta-analysis of randomized, double- blind-placebo-controlled studies testing the administration of omega-3EFA for the treatment of depression. We preformed a systematicliterature search, subdividing studies as those which used an EPA predominant or a DHA formulation. Omega 3 is more effective than placebo in treating depressive illness, although there is somevariability in results. We explored whether the composition of theomega-3 administered is important, finding that EPA predominant formulation is necessary for the full therapeutic antidepressant action with a large effect size, with little variability. The DHA predominantformulation has little antidepressant efficacy. We conclude that omega-3 does have antidepressant properties. We will also discuss the role of omega-3 in depression or other disorders, in the broaderrange of ecological, epidemiological and experimental context,focusing on findings that have implication on cellular mechanism of antidepressant action or in disease.

Pariante*, Kuan-Pin Su Psychological Medicine, London, United Kingdom, China Medical University and Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan Background: Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2) are the key enzymes in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fattyacids (PUFAs), which in turn play an important role in cytokine-induced depression and sickness behaviour. Methods: Patients with chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection (n\u00bc132) were assessed to examine the effects of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in COX2 and PLA2 genes on depression during interferon-alpha treatment; a subsample (n \u00bc63) was assessed for the levels of the threemain PUFAs, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (AA). An independent ''replication'' sample of patients with major depression unrelated to cytokine treatment (n \u00bc82) was also examined. Results: 28% of participants developed interferon-alpha-induced depression. Participants with the PLA2 BanI GG or the COX2 rs4648308 AG genotypes had a higher risk of IFN-alpha-induced depression (odds ratio \u00bc3.1 and 3.5, respectively). The ''at risk'' PLA2 genotype was associated with lower EPA levels, and the ''at risk'' COX2genotype was associated with lower DHA levels, during IFN-alpha treatment. The PLA2 BanI GG polymorphism was also associated with more somatic symptoms of depression, both in patients withinterferon-alpha-induced depression and in the replication sample ofpatients with major depression. Conclusions: Genetic variations in the COX2 and PLA2 genes increase the risk of IFN-alpha-induced depression, possibly by affecting thelevels of EPA and DHA. Moreover, PLA2 genotype is associated with somatic symptoms in depression. Our study confirms the role of inflammatory mechanisms in major depression.Disclosure: C.M. Pariante, None. Increased Brain DHA Enhances Neurogenesis, Neuritogenesis and Spatial Learning Performance Jing X. Kang* Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA Background: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) highly rich in nerve system, is critical for brain development and function. It has been shown that DHA deficiency impairs cognitive performance, while DHA supple-mentation improves the condition. However, the mechanisms under- lying the roles of DHA in neural development and brain function still remain to be elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigatethe effects of DHA on neurogenesis and neuritogenesis, as well as theirrelation to cognitive function. Methods: We used the fat-1 transgenic mouse model instead of dietary supplementation to create the difference of DHA contentin brain tissues to eliminate confounding factors of diet. BrdUwas used to label the newly generated cells by immunohisto- chemisty staining with specific antibody. Dendritic spine density of hippocampus was measured by Golgi-Cox staining. Animal perfor-mance of learning and memory was assessed by using Morris Water Maze. in vitro experiments were also performed to examine neural differentiation and proliferation, and neurite outgrowth of neuralcells.Results: Increased brain DHA enhances significantly hippocampal neurogenesis as shown by increased number of proliferating neurons and neuritogenesis as evidenced by increased density of dendriticspines of CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampus. Concurrently, thefat-1 mice exhibit better performance of learning and memory tested by Morris water maze when compared with the control wild-type animals. In vitro experiments further demonstrate that DHA promotes differentiation and neurite outgrowth of neuronal cells derived from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and also increases the proliferation of cells undergoing differentiation into neuronal lineages from the EScells.Discussion: The present study is the first to look at the effect of DHA on both structural and functional aspects in the brain under a dietary confounding factors free system, and demonstrate thatincreased brain DHA enhances neurogenesis and neuritogenesis inhippocampus and thereby improves learning and memory perfor- mance. The results of this study not only provide new insight into how DHA can influence cognitive function but also suggest a role for DHAin prevention and treatment of nerve injury and neurodegenerativediseases. Disclosure: afrom Lipid Rafts: A Possible Mechanism for the Antidepressant Effects of n-3 PUFA Mark Rasenick* University of Illinois Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, ILBackground: Several clinical studies suggest that decreased dietary fish oil is associated with increased incidence of depression and that thatdietary n-3 PUFA decreases symptoms of depression, either asmonotherapy or in conjunction with antidepressant drugs. One suggestion as a mechanism for n-3 PUFA actions is the antiinflamatory effects associated with fish oil. Another possible mechanism relates tothe association of DHA and EPA with membrane microdomains andthe mobilization of the G protein, Gs a, our of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts and into a membrane domain where Gs amore closely associates with adenylyl cyclase increasing signaling through 5HT 4.6.7, D1 or b2 receptors. It is this latter mechanism that this study addresses. Methods: C6 glioma cells were treated with the n-3 PUFAs, DHA and EPA (50 mg/ml) or citalopram (10 mM) for 1-4 days.

No change was seen in content of Gs a. Furthermore, AlF4- - activated adenylyl cyclase, an indication of the coupling between Gs aand adenylyl cyclase, was increased subsequent to citalopram treatment in a dose- and time- dependent manner. DHA and EPA treatment had a similar effect, while EPA showed a somewhat lower efficacy. Furthermore, both n-3 PUFAspotentiated citalopram actions on Gsa translocation and adenylylcyclase. Finally, chronic n-3 PUFA treatment decreased time of a photobleached fluorescent GFP-Gs afusion protein. Chonic antidepressant treatment had a similar effect.Discussion: The effects of n-3 PUFA and SSRIs in translocating Gs a from lipid rafts may require different molecular targets. It has been suggested that n-3 PUFA alter membrane properties of non-raftdomains. It has also been suggested that n-3 PUFA might modulateacyl transferase activity, modifying prenylation of G proteins and changing their membrane association or compartmentalization. Should this prove to be the case, it would suggest a clear molecularrationale for both antidepressant properties and supplementalantidepressant effects for n-3 PUFA. Experiments to ascertain this are underway. Disclosure: M.M. Rasenick, Eli Lilly, Part 4; Lundbeck, Part 4. Panel Session The Insula-A Therapeutic Target for Nicotine Dependence? Role of the Insula in Drug Addiction: in Adolescent London*, Adriana Galva \u00b4n UCLA, Los Angeles, CABackground: Drug addiction is a complex disorder, characterized by maladaptive responses to environmental and interoceptive stimuli thatcan trigger craving for the abused drug. Brain imaging studies haveshown that craving for both cocaine and cigarettes, induced by drug- relevant visual stimuli, is correlated with changes in glucose metabolism in the insula, which is thought to have an important rolein drug craving. Among human smokers who suffered strokes that lesioned the insula, an unexpectedly large proportion quit smoking and endorsed a loss of cigarette craving. This finding suggested that modulating insula activity may provide a useful approach to thetreatment of nicotine dependence. This presentation will focus on theimportance of the insula with regard to inhibitory control, a cognitive function that is important to addiction, and how the contribution of the insula to self-control may be compromised in adolescent smokers.Methods: Participants were twenty-five adolescent smokers (15-21 years of age) who reported daily smoking for at least 6 months before their participation in the study, and twenty-five matched nonsmokers (16-21 years of age) who reported smoking fewer than 5 cigarettes intheir lifetimes. The subjects performed a response inhibition task(Stop-signal Task) while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. The primary outcome measure was blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal change during successful responseinhibition. Results: As observed before in healthy nonsmokers, inhibition during the Stop-signal Task involved activation of a network of regions,including the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex andinsula. Task-related activity in these regions was correlated with stopping ability (greater activity with smaller stop-signal reaction time). In our sample, there were no significant group differences inactivation; but during inhibition, activity in cortical areas, includingthe insula, anterior cingulate cortex and inferior frontal gyrus of the adolescent smokers, was positively correlated with time from waking to the first cigarette of the day. In addition, activity during inhibition,particularly in the insula and anterior cingulate cortex, was negatively correlated with number of cigarettes smoked per day. Discussion: These findings in adolescent smokers suggest that activity in the insula, related to inhibitory control of a motor response, is eitherdirectly related to the ability to resist the urge to smoke or inversely related to the magnitude of that urge. They also suggest that insula activity during inhibition either is negatively affected by exposure tocigarette smoke, or alternatively, that individuals who smoke moremay have less activation of the insula during inhibition even before they initiate cigarette smoking. In any case, the observed link between insula activation and successful inhibition along with evidence for animportant contribution of the insula to decision-making, provides abasis for controversy regarding the potential value of using TMS to attenuate insula activity for the treatment of nicotine dependence.

Naqvi* Columbia University, New York, NY Background: A large number of functional imaging studies have shown that cue-induced drug urges are associated with activity in a cortical network that involves the insula. Despite this fact, the insula hasreceived relatively little attention for its role in addiction. Here, we sought to test the role of the insula in addiction by examining the effects of focal brain damage in this region on human cigarettesmoking behavior.Methods: We identified patients who sustained damage to the insula (N\u00bc19) at the time that they were smoking regularly (mean # of cigarettes per day \u00bc27; SD \u00bc13.9), and compared them with patients with damage in non-insula regions (N \u00bc50) who were smoking a similar amount when they sustained brain damage (mean # of cigarettes per day \u00bc27, SD \u00bc14.6). We first compared the rate of quitting smoking between these two groups. We then compared therate of ''disruption of smoking addiction'' between the two groups,defined as quitting smoking immediately after brain injury, with great ease, without urges, and without relapsing.S32 ACNP 49th Annual ConferenceResults: We found that smokers who sustained damage to the insula were more likely than smokers with damage in non-insula regions to quit smoking after their brain injury, though this difference was not significant (odds ratio \u00bc2.94, x2 \u00bc2.74, and P\u00bc0.10). Smokers with insula damage were significantly more likely to undergo a ''disruptionof smoking addiction'' after their brain injury compared to smokers with non-insula damage (odds ratio \u00bc22.05, x2 \u00bc16.64, and P\u00bc0.0005). Effects of both right and left insula damage were found. A whole-brain, region of interest analysis demonstrated that this effectwas not due to damage in regions surrounding the insula. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that damage to the insula is associated with a profound disruption in the addiction to smoking,evidenced by an ability to quit easily, immediately, without relapsingand without an urge to smoke. We discuss these findings in light of a theoretical framework for the role of the insula in conscious interoception, emotional feelings and decision-making. We also presentpreliminary behavioral data showing that the interoceptive effects of smoking contribute to conscious feelings that may promote addiction, including smoking pleasure and cue-induced smoking urges.Disclosure: N.H.

Granular Insular Cortex Inactivation as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy for Nicotine Addiction Bernard Le Foll*, Abhiram Pushparaj, Benoit Forget Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, CanadaBackground: Nicotine is the principal component of tobacco smoke that leads to addiction and recent evidence suggest that damage to theinsular cortex (insula) disrupt tobacco addiction in human smokers.Our aim was to investigate the effect of an inactivation of this structure in an animal model of nicotine addiction. Methods: We have investigated the effect of reversible inactivation of the granular insula through local bilateral infusions of the GABA muscimol) on nicotine self- administration under fixed and progressive ratio and on reinstatementof nicotine seeking induced by nicotine priming or nicotine-associatedcues in rats. We have also evaluated the effect of insula inactivation on food self-administration and relapse as a control. Only rats with correct bilateral placement of the cannulaes in the granular insula havebeen included for data analysis.Results: Infusion of the balofen-muscimol mixture into the insula significantly reduced nicotine self-administration compared to vehicle administration in the insula (P o0.05) under both fixed and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement. In contrast, insular cortex inactivation did not modify responding for food (NS). Significant reinstatement of nicotine seeking was obtained by cuespresentation and nicotine Both reinstatements(Po0.05) were attenuated by insular cortex inactivation, whereas reinstatement for food seeking was not affected (NS). Conclusions: Our study indicated that the integrity of the granular insula is necessary to the rats to exhibit motivation to take nicotineand to relapse to nicotine seeking, but not for their motivation to consume food pellets or to relapse for food seeking. Indeed, methods those are able to modulate the activity of the insula, such as repetitivetranscranial magnetic stimulation or deep brain stimulation, may represent a new therapeutic way to treat tobacco addiction and relapse in humans.Disclosure: B. Le Foll, Pfizer, Part 1. Can Repeated Stimulation of the Prefrontal or Insular Cortices Affect Addictive Behavior? Abraham Zangen* of Science, Rehovot, IsraelBackground: Repeated administration of nicotine and other addictive drugs induces neuroadaptations in several brain regions resulting inaltered cortical neurotransmission and excitability. Electrical stimula- tion of specific brain regions can be used in animal models and humans to induce local activation or disruption of specific circuitries or alter neuronal excitability and cause neuroadaptations. Non-surgical stimulation of specific brain regions in human addicts canbe achieved by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Repetitive TMS (rTMS) is used for transient stimulation or disruption of neural activity in specific cortical regions, allowing investigation of the acuteeffect of stimulation on drug craving, while repeated sessions caninduce long-lasting neuroadaptations and thereby become a potential therapy. Methods: We have investigated the effects of repeated stimulation of the prefrontal cortex in animal models and humans on glutamatergicneuroadaptations, drug craving and consumption. Recently, we have begun to study the effects of repeated stimulation of the insular cortex (using a unique TMS coil) on cigarette craving, consumption anddependence in heavy smokers. Results: Ten daily stimulation sessions of the prefrontal cortex reduced drug seeking and consumption in animals trained to self-administer cocaine. The treatment also normalized some of theneuroadaptations in glutamatergic receptors that were induced by repeated consumption of cocaine in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. Similarly, ten rTMS (but not sham) sessions overthe prefrontal cortex in heavy smokers reduced cigarette craving,consumption and nicotine dependence, however, these effects were quite modest and tended to dissipate over time. Preliminary data on the effects of repeated rTMS sessions over the insular cortexusing a unique deep TMS coil indicate that this treatment is well tolerated does not induce significant side effects and can cause reductions in nicotine craving and consumption.Discussion: The potential use of localized electromagnetic stimulation in the study and treatment of addictive behaviors is promising, but requires additional basic research and combination with imaging techniques in order to identify optimal stimulation parameters thatmay induce long-lasting 3; Brainsway, Part 4. Wednesday, December 8, 2010 Panel Session Developmental Etiologies of Degenerative Disorders: Lessons from Psychiatric Diseases Impairment of Developmental Stem Cell-Mediated Striatal Neuro- genesis in a Knock-In Model Pathogenesis and Treatment of Neurodegenerative DiseasesMark F. Mehler* Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NYBackground: The pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD) and other neurodegenerative diseases remains elusive. HD is caused by mutation in exon 1 of the gene that codes for huntingtin and represents the prototypical example of the expansion repeat subclass ofneurodegenerative diseases. Although huntingtin is pan-neuronal,pathological changes in HD are selective, targeting the medium spiny projections neurons of the striatum. Research initiatives in patholo- gical brain aging have traditionally focused on defining thepathobiological processes mediating neuronal dysfunction and death during adult life. However, there is increasing evidence that huntingtin has selective functions in the developing striatum. These observationssuggest a potential mechanism to explain the selective cellularvulnerability present in HD as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases. The identification of increasingly early pathophysio- logical abnormalities in HD therefore suggests the possibility thatS33 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceimpairments of striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) specification and maturation may underlie the etiology of HD. Methods: To examine these important issues, we utilized combined detailed in vivo and in vitro analysis of regional stem cell-mediated self-renewal, expansion, proliferation, lineage restriction, striatalneurogenesis, neuronal subtype specification, maturation and the progressive elaboration of the functional organization and associated compartmentalization of the striatum in an HD knock-in mouse modelthat most faithfully recapitulates the molecular genetics of human HD.Results: We demonstrate that HD knock-in (Hdh-Q111) mice exhibited delayed acquisition of the early striatal cytoarchitecture with aberrant expression of progressive mGluR1, and NeuN). Hdh-Q111 striatal progenitorsalso between embryonic day (E) 13.5-15.5 (BrdU birth-dating) and an enhanced fraction of abnormal cycling cells in association with expansion of the pool of intermediateprogenitors and over expression of the core pluripotency (PP) factor, Sox2. Clonal analysis further revealed that Hdh-Q111 stem cells (NSCs) displayed: impaired lineage potential, enhanced late-stage self-renewal, and deregulatedMSN subtype specification. Further, our analysis revealed that in addition to Sox2, the core PP factor, Nanog is expressed within the striatal generative and mantle regions, and in Hdh-Q111 embryos thefraction of Nanog-expressing MSN precursors was substantiallyincreased. Moreover, compared to Hdh-Q18 embryos, the Hdh-Q111 striatal anlagen exhibited significantly higher levels of the essential PP cofactor, Stat3.Discussion: These findings suggest that Sox2 and Nanog may play roles during a selective window of embryonic brain maturation, and alterations of these factors may, in part, be responsible formediating the aberrant program of Hdh-Q111 striatal MSN specifi-cation and maturation. We propose that these HD-associated developmental abnormalities might compromise neuronal homeo- stasis and subsequently render MSNs and their associated cortico-striatal and striatonigral as well as stratopallidal functional net-works more vulnerable to late life stressors, culminating in progressive neuronal and neural network dysfunction and ultimately neuro- Orr* Minnesota, Minneapolis, MNBackground: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of nine inherited, typically adult onset, polyglutamine neurodegenerativediseases. Besides an expanded glutamine tract, disease requires phosphorylation of S776 in ATXN1 (the SCA1 encoded protein). We used a conditional transgenic mouse model of SCA1 to delay thepostnatal expression of mutant ATXN1 until after completion ofcerebellar development. Mice in which expression of ATXN1[82Q] was delayed during postnatal development had a much less severe form of disease than mice in which mutant ATXN1 was expressed prior to thecompletion of cerebellar postnatal development. These results indicate that compromising cerebellar development contributes to severity of neurodegeneration in an adult. During the first 2-3 weeks after birth,climbing fiber (CF) terminals translocate from the Purkinje cell (PC)sbodies and form synaptic contacts on the primary and secondary branches of the PC dendritic tree. Methods: To examine if CF terminals fail to develop properly and extend fully along PC dendrites in SCA1 mice, we used VGLUT2immunostaining and anterograde olivocerebellar projec- tions biotinylated dextran-amine (BDA) into the contralateral inferior.Results: In both unaffected lines there was a progressive increase in the extension of CF terminals along PC dendrites from p14, reaching a maximum at five weeks of age and remaining constant to 12 weeks ofage. In ATXN1[82Q] mice, extension of CF terminals remained constant between p14 and p17. By five weeks of age the CF terminals in ATXN1[82Q] mice increased significantly but to a level less than seen in wt FVB animals. Like ATXN1[82Q] CF terminals, CF terminalsin ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice, with a phospho-mimicking residue atposition 776, showed no signs of increasing their extension along PCs between days p14 and p17. This failure of CF terminals to course along PCs remained out to five weeks of age in ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice.These data are consistent with an alteration in CF development inSCA1 affected mice. This compromise in CF synapse localization was more pronounced in ATXN1[30Q]-D776 mice than in ATXN1[82Q]- S776 mice.Discussion: The decreased ability of CF terminals to develop normally in the SCA1 affected mice raises the p ossibility that this process is an important component of the developmental aspect of SCA1. In both SCA1 affected lines transge ne expression was restricted to PCs. Thus, the affect on CF terminal differentiation reflects a property intrinsic to PCs. We further suggest that the ability of mutant ATXN1 to affect CF development is linked to t he degree that phosphorylation of S776 is misregulated.Disclosure: H.T. Orr, Athena Diagnostics, Part 1. Abnormal Brain Structure in Children at Risk for Huntington's Disease: Evidence for Abnormal Brain Development Peggy Nopoulos* University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA Background: Huntington's Disease (HD) is conceptualized as a neurodegenerative disease. However, several lines of evidence support the notion that prior to degeneration, there may be abnormal brain development. This study was designed to evaluate brain structure inchildren at risk for HD, thereby examining brain structure decades prior to the onset of symptoms. Methods: A total of 21 children (ages 7-18 years) at risk for HD were enrolled in the study. For research purp oses only, genetic studies divided these subjects into 13 gene expanded and 8 gene non-expanded participants. As CAG length is related to age of onset, estimated 'years to onset' can be calculated. For the gene expanded group, the meanestimated years to onset was 34.4 ye ars. Thus, these subjects were, on average, greater than three decades f rom manifesting significant disease symptoms (onset of disease). All subj ects underwent MRI brain scanning. The gene non-expanded subjects were merged with a data base ofhealthy controls and brain structure was evaluating comparing the 13 gene-expanded subjects with a total of 136 healthy control subjects (ages 7-18). Methods included volume o f brain tissue, cortical thickness mapping, and Fractional Anisotropy ( FA) from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Results : The gene-expanded subjects had significant abnormalities in brain structure - compared to controls, an excess of whitematter and a decrease in cortical gray matter. The increased volumeof white matter was localized to the sub-cortical region and frontal lobes. This was also supported by a significantly elevated FA in the sub-cortical region and frontal lobes. Cortical thickness maps indicatethe areas of thinning occur mostly in the parietal and occipital lobes. The caudate had a significant group by age interaction such that the trajectory of volume change over time was different in the gene-expanded subjects compared to controls: young gene-expandedsubjects were enlarged but the older subjects (teenagers) had reduced volume of the caudate. Discussion : Subjects who are estimated to be greater than three decades from diagnosis have abnormalities of brain structuresupporting the notion that abnormal development plays an important role in the pathoetiology of HD. Although HD is a rare disease, it can serve as a model for other degenerative brain disorders such asParksinson's Disease, other polyglutamine expansion diseases (such of Mutant Disrupted-In- Schizophrenia-1: Towards Developmental and Adult Functions of the Candidate GeneMikhail V. Pletnikov* Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MDBackground: Major psychiatric disorders have a neurodevelopmental origin. New mouse models with cellular, spatial and temporalmanipulations in candidate genes will help advance our knowledge of the specific functions of those genes in the developing and mature brain. Genetic evidence implicates mutations and polymorphisms inthe gene Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 ( DISC1 ) as risk factors for both schizophrenia and mood disorders. We have generated a transgenic mouse model of forebrain neurons-restricted inducible expression of mutant human DISC1.Methods: In order to gain insight into the roles of DISC1 at various stages of neurodevelopment, we examined the effects of mutant hDISC1 expressed during 1) only prenatal period, 2) only postnatalperiod, or 3) both periods. We evaluated a set of mouse behaviors,volumes of the lateral ventricles, cortex and hippocampus, cortical regional quantities of GABA neurons, the linear density of dendritic spines in the hippocampus and cortex, regional levels of monoamines,expression of endogenous DISC1 and its interacting proteins in adultmale and female mutant and control mice. Results: All periods of expression similarly led to decreased levels of cortical dopamine and fewer parvalbumin-positive neurons in thecortex. Combined prenatal and postnatal expression produced increased aggression and enhanced response to psychostimulants in male mice along with increased linear density of dendritic spines onneurons of the dentate gyrus lower levels ofendogenous DISC1 and LIS1. Prenatal expression only resulted in smaller brain volume, while selective postnatal expression gave rise to decreased social behavior in male mice and depression-like responsesin female mice as well as enlarged lateral ventricles and decreaseddopamine content in the hippocampus of female mice, and decreased level of endogenous DISC1. Discussion: Our data show that mutant DISC1 exerts differential effects on neurobehavioral phenotypes, depending on the stage of develop- ment at which the protein is expressed. The multiple and diverse abnormalities detected in mutant DISC1 mice are reminiscent offindings in major mental diseases.Disclosure: M.V. Pletnikov, None. Panel Session How Does Anxiety Take Hold: Anatomical and Functional Connectivity in Adolescents and Adults Specific Regions of Prefrontal Cortex and Insula Differentially Influence Amygdala Output Paths: Implications for Brain Development and Adolescent AnxietyJulie Fudge* University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NYBackground: Hyperactive amygdala responses are a well-established finding in anxiety disorders. Developmental fMRI studies indicate thatthe amygdala is relatively more 'sensitive' to emotional information in adolescents compared to adults. While this relative 'receptiveness' to emotional cues has survival value, it may also be a substrate for thedevelopment of anxiety disorders in this age group. One hypothesis isthat underdeveloped inhibitory control between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala in adolescents contributes to this vulnerable window. To better define this question for human studies, weexamined specific PFC-amygdala paths in nonhuman primates.Methods: We placed injections of bi-directional neuronal tracers into the basal nucleus in Old world monkeys using stereotaxic techniques.We analyzed the distribution of retrogradely labeled cells throughout the PFC and insula for each injection site. We also compared the distribution of labeled fibers in the striatum, a key output for the basal nucleus.Results: Preliminary results indicate two patterns of connections: the ventral basal amygdala receives restricted and discrete PFC inputs and influences specific striatal regions, while the dorsal amygdala receives broad PFC inputs, and has a much more widespread influence on thestriatum. Specifically, the ventromedial basal nucleus receives its maininputs from the insula, while the ventrolateral basal nucleus receives its main inputs from the subgenual cingulate (sgACC). Output paths from these ventral are also relatively segregated:the insula- medial basal nucleus path is directed to ventromedialnucleus while the sgACC- lateral basal nucleus path is connectd to the ventrolateral nucleus accumbens. In contrast, broad PFC and insula regions project to the dorsal basal nucleus, which inturn projects broadly to the ventral striatum, including large regions of the ventral striatum posterior to the anterior commissure. Discussion: These differential PFC-amygdala-striatal paths suggest specific modulatory controls that can be tested in adolescent and adulthumans using functional neuroimaging. Disclosure: J.L. Fudge, None. The Development of Amygdalo-Cortical Connectivity in Animal Models: Implications in Pathogenesis Miles G. Cunningham* McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Belmont, MA Background: Adolescence is a period of rapid biopsychosocial growth and is a critical stage for the development of emotional maturity and diverse forms of psychopathology. In animal models, the basolateralnucleus of the amygdala (BLA), known to mediate fear and anxiety and for assigning emotional valence to cognitive processes, densely innervates the attentional,and motivational behaviors. Because these two corticolimbic regions appear to contribute to the integration of emotion and cognition during the adolescent period, we sought to characterize the developmentof their connectivity, with particular interest in the role of theGABAergic interneuron. We then altered activity of this limbic relay with sustained activation of the BLA during a critical window of amygdalo-cortical innervation. This procedure may serve as a model foradolescent anxiety, and it also has implications for the development of schizophrenia. Methods: Using the rapid anterograde tracer, biocytin, delivered stereotaxically to the posterior division of the BLA, amygdalofugalfiber density was analyzed within the mPFC at successive postnatal time points through development (postnatal days 6-120). We also analyzed the interaction of BLA fibers with GABA-immunoreactive(-ir) elements within the mPFC using light, confocal and electronmicroscopy. A novel, minimally-invasive, chronic infusion method was then devised and implanted to deliver the GABAA receptor antagonist, picrotoxin, within the BLA over a critical two-week post-weanling period. The electrophysiologic effects of this developmental picrotoxin infusion (DPI) on mPFC GABA currents were studied using slice preparations. A rapid Golgi method was also used to investigatechanges in neuronal morphology, and the effects of DPI on GABAergicinterneurons was studied with immunocytochemistry. Results: The density of labeled [[Unsupported Character - &#64257;]]bers originating from the BLA increases dramatically withinlayers II and V of the mPFC during the late postweanling period. Lightand confocal microscopy revealed that BLA fibers interacted with virtually every GABAergic neuron observed, having an 8-fold curvi- linear increase in axodendritic contacts and a 3-fold increase inaxosomatic contacts through development. Ultrastructural analysisdemonstrated that the greatest proportion of BLA was associated with a dramatic reduction in parvalbumin-ir neurons within the mPFC, and electrophysiological recordings from pyramidal neurons revealed significantly decreased GABA currents. Golgi staining demonstrated increased neuritesprouting for both stellate and pyramidal neurons in the BLA with asignificant increase in spine density. Discussion: Late development of amygdalo-cortical connectivity may provide an anatomical basis for the integration of normal as well asabnormal emotional behavior during maturation. The GABAergicinterneuron is a primary target for amygdalar afferents and positioned to modulate limbic processing. Loss of GABAergic function may result in dysregulation of amygdalo-cortical function and can occur withincreased activation of the amygdala during a critical period ofcorticolimbic development, such as with increased arousal states during adolescence and early adulthood.

Roy*, Kristin Gotimer, Erica L. Dixon, Adriana Di Martino, Monique Ernst, Daniel Pine, Francisco Castellanos, Michael Milham NYU Child Study Center, New York, NY Background: Neurodevelopmental theories suggest that adolescence is characterized by a significant gap between the developmental trajectories of prefrontal and limbic regions. As such, the emotional and behavioralchanges observed during this developmental period may emerge frominteractions between regions such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex that have been implicated in emotion regulation processes. Anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia,that show an increased onset during adolescence are characterized by hyperresponsivity of the amygdala as well as dysfunction of related prefrontal regions. While there is some evidence that amygdalafunctional connectivity (FC) is altered in adolescents with anxietydisorders, this has not been evaluated systematically within a develop- mental context. Therefore, the aim of the current work was twofold: (1) to evaluate the intrinsic FC of the amygdala across development;and (2) to examine differences in amygdala FC between adolescentswith anxiety disorders and typically developing age-matched controls. Measures of the intrinsic FC of the amygdala were obtained using novel resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)methods. Methods: Participants were 90 typically developing children (ages 7-12; n\u00bc31), adolescents (ages 13- 19; n \u00bc26), and adults (ages 20-40; n \u00bc33) and 13 adolescents diagnosed with a primary anxiety disorder (ages12-17). During the MRI session, participants were scanned for 6 minutes at rest (e.g., lie still with eyes open) and a high resolution anatomical scan was obtained for registration purposes. Datapreprocessing and functional connectivity analyses were based onthose used in our previous study of amygdala FC in adults (Roy et al., 2009). Regions of interest (ROIs; total amygdala and basolateral, centromedial, and superficial subdivisions) for each hemisphere using stereotaxic, probabilistic maps implemented in FSL's Juelich histological atlas. To address our first aim, analyses of variance were used to evaluate differences in amygdala FC across the threeage groups. To address the second aim, we examined group differencesin amygdala FC between adolescents with and without anxiety disorders. Results: (1) Significant differences in amygdala FC were observed across the three developmental groups. In particular, children showedgreater total amygdala FC than adolescents and adults across several cortical and subcortical regions including the inferior frontal gyrus, precuneus, and thalamus. No differences between adolescents andadults were observed. (2) Adolescents with anxiety disorders showedaltered FC between the total amygdala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggestive of altered emotion regulation capacity. Furtheranalyses showed specific disruptions in the FC of individual amygdala subdivisions as well. Discussion: These results suggest significant developmental changes in the intrinsic FC of the amygdala that may be altered in adolescentswith anxiety disorders.Disclosure: A.K. Roy, None. Patterns of Functional Activation and Co-Activation During Fear and Reward Processing in Adolescent Health and Anxiety Amanda Guyer* University of California Davis, CA Background: Neurodevelopmental models of psychopathology suggest that altered subcortical reactivity and protracted cortical development renders adolescence a vulnerable period for anxiety.One hypothesis suggests that an imbalance in cognitive input from cortical regions relative to emotion-driven input from subcortical regions alters the processing of salient stimuli that correlates withinformation-processing symptoms consistent with anxiety (e.g.,attentional biases to threat). Considerable work implicates abnormal neural activation and disrupted attention to facial-threat cues in adult anxiety disorders. We extended this past work to adolescentswith and without anxiety disorders by examining functional (e.g., amygdala and ventral-lateral and orbitofrontal cortex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks were used. Fear-circuitry response to anticipated social evaluation from peers was assessed with an ecologically-valid Chat-room task. Participants were led to believe they would interact online with a study participant, viewed photographs of these ''peers,'' and rated their interest in chatting with each. Participants were photo-graphed and told the peers would also rate them. During a subsequentfMRI scan, participants rated the peer's interest in chatting with them. Reward-circuitry response to anticipated reward cues was assessed with the Monetary Incentive Delay task, where participants respondedto incentives of varying magnitude to be gained or lost. AFNI was usedfor between-group and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) con- nectivity analyses to assess hypothesized patterns of event-related functional activations and co-activations.Results: Anxious vs. healthy adolescents showed amygdala hyperacti- vation when anticipating peer evaluation from undesirable peers, t 26\u00bc3.53 (right amygdala peak: 27, /C03,/C021). PPI analyses revealed a significant positive association between amygdala and vlPFC activationin anxious vs healthy adolescents in response to these stimuli, t 26\u00bc3.79 (BA47: -32, 44, /C024). incentives. Guided by thesebetween-group differences in striatal response, PPI analyses of striatal- OFC co-activation patterns are underway. Discussion: Past research found amygdala-vlPFC dysfunction in adolescents with anxiety disorders when viewing negatively-valenced social stimuli in threatening contexts. The current findings suggest that fear-circuitry dysfunction also manifests in anxious adolescentswho misperceive anticipated social evaluation from positively-valenced peers as threatening. In addition, the present results indicate striatal hyperactivation in anxious adolescents to non-social reward cues of high salience that may co-activate with orbito-frontal regions involved in regulating behavior associated with rewardsensitivity. Mapping patterns of functional connectivity in fear and reward circuitry can enrich neurodevelopmental models of anxiety and inform pediatric anxiety treatments regarding specificsymptom-relevant perturbations in Hippocampal Neurogenesis,Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Regulation and Mood-Related Behavior Role of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis and Cytokine Signaling in the Antineurogenic and Behavioral Responses to Stress Ronald Duman* Yale University, New Haven, CTBackground : Brain imaging studies have consistently reported that stress-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and PTSD,result in atrophy of limbic structures implicated in these illnesses, mostnotably the hippocampus. Studies in rodents report that repeated stress causes retraction of apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons, as well as decreased neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. Investigations of themechanisms underlying the reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis havefocused on the HPA axis, and demonstrate a role for elevation of glucocorticoids. In addition, more recent studies provide evidence for that elevation of cytokines play a significant role in the actions of stress.Studies of the interactions of the HPA axis and cytokines and relatedsignaling cascades will be presented and discussed. Methods : Rats or mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), and sucrose preference was determined. Behavior was also testedin novelty suppressed feeding (NSF), and other models of anxiety. The role of cytokines, specifically interleukin-1 b(IL-1b) was assessed in rat by administration of an inhibitor IL-1Ra and in mutant mice by deletion ofthe IL-1R. Levels of neurogenesis were assessed by injection and labelingnewborn cells with BrdU. In vivo andin vitro studies were conducted to examine related signaling pathways including NF kB. The expression of IL-1R1 and NF kB in neural progenitor cells was assessed by immuno- histochemistry and in NF kB reporter mice. Results : Administration of an IL-1 bantagonist completely blocked the decrease in sucrose preference and reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis caused by exposure to CUS, and a similar blockadewas observed in IL-1R deletion mutant mice, which also displayed reduced anxiety in several models. Administration of an NF kB inhibitor also blocked the actions of CUS on sucrose preference andneurogenesis. Cellular localization studies demonstrate that IL-R1 isexpressed on neural progenitor cells and that CUS increases NF kB signaling in these same cells. In vitro studies confirm that IL-1 b directly inhibits the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and thatthese effects are mediated by NF kB signaling. Discussion : The results demonstrate that IL-1 band NF kB signaling underlie the anhedonic and antineurogenic effects of CUS. The data also demonstrate that inhibition of neurogenesis occur via direct effects ofIL-1bon neural progenitor cell. This contrasts with the results of another study, which reports that the effects of CUS are blocked by removal of adrenal-glucocorticoids, indicating an indirect effect of IL-1 bwith activation of the HPA axis as an intermediary. Further studies areneeded to examine cytokine and HPA axis interactions.

Disclosure: R.S. Duman: Part HPA FunctionAmar Sahay, Kimberly Scobie, Alexis S. Hill, Rene \u00b4Hen* Columbia University, New York, NYBackground: Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a unique form of plasticity that generates new neurons in the dentate gyrus throughoutlife. Adult-born neurons have been implicated in both cognitive functions and in mediating the behavioral effects of antidepressants. However, it is not known whether stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve cognition and mood.Methods: Here we use an inducible genetic gain-of-function strategy to cell autonomously augment adult neurogenesis. Specifically, we take advantage of the fact that a significant fraction of adult-born hippocampal neurons undergo apoptotic cell death during the firstweeks after their birth. Therefore we reasoned that a blockade ofapoptotic cell death in young neurons would result in an increase in neurogenesis. Results: We show that mice in which the pro-apoptotic gene, Bax, is deleted specifically in adult progenitors have increased survival ofadult-born dentate granule neurons, exhibit enhanced neurogenesis- dependent synaptic plasticity and discriminate between similar contexts more efficiently than controls. In addition, increasing thenumber of adult-born neurons produced an antidepressant-like behavioral response in mice that were exposed to a chronic stress paradigm. Furthermore we show that mice with increased neurogen-esis have a reduced response to stress as measured by lower levels ofcirculating corticosterone. These results together with ablation studies suggest that young hippocampal neurons contribute to the modulation of the HPA axis. Discussion: Our findings suggest that strategies aimed at stimulating hippocampal neurogenesis may impact mood as a consequence of their effect on HPA axis function. Furthermore, our results suggest that inhibitors of cell death may be used in antidepressant therapies.Disclosure: R. Hen, Brain Cells, consultant; AstraZeneca, consultant. The Impact of Suppression of Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis on Hypothalamic NeuroendocrinologyKeri Martinowich*, Robert Schloesser National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MDBackground: The hippocampus shows remarkable structural and functional plasticity. An important component of adult structural plasticity is the unique capacity of the hippocampus for lifelong neurogenesis. Decreases in hippocampal neurogenesis have beenidentified in various animal models of stress and after glucocorticoid(GC) administration. Stress and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation are key factors in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. The hippocampus has been recognized for its capacity as apotential negative feedback regulator of the HPA axis. Whether generation of newly born granule cells in the adult hippocampus is important for hypothalamic control and normal endocrine functioninghas not been well studied.Methods: To study the impact of newly born granule cells on hypothalamic neuroendocrinology we conducted experiments using transgenic mice that allow conditional ablation of newborn neurons. Inthese mice, herpes-simplex virus thymidine acidic protein (GFAP) promoter. This promoter restricts HSV-tk expression to astrocytes and neural progenitors and administration of the antiviraldrug valganciclovir (VGCV) ablates actively dividing GFAP + cells. Transgenic animals undergoing prolonged VGCV treatment (NG-) completely lack hippocampal neurogenesis while wild-type animalsundergoing prolonged treatment (Ctrl) retain intact hippocampalneurogenesis. To study the stress response and neuroendocrine function after suppression of neurogenesis, we measured GC levels, mapped hypothalamic neuronal activation patterns, analyzed hypotha-lamic gene expression and used in situ hybridization and immuno- histochemistry to map cell populations driving changes in patterns of expression. Results: We measured plasma concentrations of corticosterone (cort) in Ctrl and NG- mice in the home cage and after mild stress exposure.As expected, stress exposure resulted in significantly increased cort in both groups. However, comparison of groups after stress revealed thatS37 ACNP 49th Annual ConferenceNG- mice show significantly higher cort. Importantly, we verified that NG- animals were not chronically stress by showing no difference between Ctrl and NG- animals in total body weights or in weights of adrenals, thymus and testes. It has been shown that differences inlevels of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression arecorrelated with GC feedback sensitivity and the HPA axis response. We examined hippocampal GR expression in Ctrl and NG- mice and found no differences suggesting that suppression of neurogenesis affectsHPA axis inhibition through an alternative mechanism. To betterunderstand the HPA axis dysregulation following stress we carried out c-fos labeling in the hypothalamus of Ctrl and NG- mice and identified significantly different patterns of neuronal activation.Genome-wide analysis of hypothalamic gene expression providedfurther evidence that systems involved in neuronal activation were significantly changed. Expression changes for several candidate genes pointed to changes in specific neuronal sub-populations within thehypothalamus. Discussion: Our studies provide strong preliminary evidence that newborn neurons play a functional role in the hippocampal circuitryand are particularly important for the hippocampal output capacitythat provides normal inhibitory control over the hypothalamus and its normal endocrine functioning.

Is Hippocampal Neurogenesis \u00b8ois Rabelais de Tours, Tours, for the thera- peutic monoaminergic-acting antidepressants (ADs) such as fluoxetine or imipramine, is not necessary to the effects of antidepressant-like compounds acting via the hypothalamus-pitui-tary-adrenal (HPA)-axis such as a CRF1 antagonist or the V1bantagonist. This suggests that another mechanism might underlie the therapeutic effects of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-acting drugs. It is well known from the literature that the HPA axis isdisrupted in depression, and that the restoration of this dysfunction isnecessary to observe ADs effects. As it is well known that the hippocampus participates to the negative feedback over the HPA axis, we thus hypothesized that one of the functions of neurogenesis in theAD's effects may concern its ability to restore this feedback when it has been disrupted. We will present experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis.Methods: BALB/c mice were subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) and chronically treated with fluoxetine. Dexamethasone suppression test was applied using either ip injection -to assess the integrity of the HPA-negative-feedback- or using intra-hippocampaladministration, to evaluate the hippocampal participation in thisfeedback. Plasmatic corticosterone was measured via RIA. Suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis was achieved via focal irradiation. Brain activation was done using fos immunohistochemistry.Results: We demonstrate that UCMS reduces the number of new hippocampal neurons and decreases the negative feedback on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis measured by the dexa-methasone suppression test. This involves the hippocampus, as intra-hippocampal dexamethasone also elicits corticosterone suppression. This suppression is absent after UCMS, an effects that is reversed by fluoxetine. This is achieved via a pathway going from the hippocampusto the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, via a relay thebed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), as intra-hippocampal dexamethasone induces an activation of the BNST, that is reduced by UCMS and counteracted by fluoxetine. While ablation ofhippocampal neurogenesis has no effect its own in the intra-hippocampal dexamethasone test, UCMS elicits a deficit in corticos- terone suppression. This deficit is reversed by fluoxetine in nonirradiated mice, but not in mice having abolition of hippocampal neurogenesis. Discussion: These results suggest ADs act through neurogenesis to re-establish hippocampal regulation of the HPA axis.Disclosure: C. Belzung, None. Panel Session Intersecting Neurobiology and Epidemiology of ADHD andDrug Addiction Stimulant Treatment History, Assigned and Self-Selected, as Predictor of Late Adolescent Substance Abuse in ADHD Brooke S.G. Molina* University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PABackground: A controversial issue in research on ADHD is the effect of the CNS stimulant treatments on risk for substance use dis-orders (SUDs). The small literature that has examined this questionhas yielded mixed results with some studies reporting worsening, and others reporting attenuation, of SUD risk. A limited number of large longitudinal studies of children with ADHD exist, andnone provide prospectively gathered treatment data that followan initial period of random assignment to evidence-based treat- ments. The longitudinal follow-up of the children in the multi- site Multimodal Treatment of ADHD study (MTA) provides thisopportunity.Methods: The original MTA sample consists of 579 children who were diagnosed with DSM-IV Combined Type ADHD and randomly assigned to one of 4 treatment groups for 14 mos: intensive medi-cation management, intensive behavior therapy (Beh), the combina- tion (Comb), or referral to community care. The sample was interviewed at immediate post-treatment, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, and mostrecently 12, yrs post baseline. A local normative comparison group(LNCG; n \u00bc289) of classmate controls was recruited at the 2-year assessment and has been interviewed in parallel. This abstract describes results from the 8-year assessment (80% study retention;M age \u00bc17). Results: Substance use/SUD was examined as a function of 1) childhood ADHD diagnosis; b) randomly assigned treatment in childhood and past year stimulant treatment; and c) cumulativestimulant treatment since baseline. Use of any substance beyond selected levels was the primary outcome. Random effects regression indicated a main effect of ADHD group on substance use overall,po.0001, and at all time points, p \u00bc.0025 to.0394. Using GEE models, neither treatment assignment nor past year stimulant treatment were significant predictors of substance use with one exception: children who received Beh or Comb were less likely to report sub-stance use at 3 yrs than were the other children, p \u00bc.038. Propensity score matching analyses were used to create matched pairs of subjects with minimal differences in potential confounders (e.g., ADHD symptom severity, treatment group assignment) but largedifferences in cumulative stimulant treatment. Using these matched pairs, no significant associations were found between cumu- lative medication treatment and substance use or SUD, all p-values4.25 (up to.73). Discussion: Our results provide confirmation of substance use risk in adolescence for children diagnosed with combined type ADHD. Our results extend findings of potential behavior therapy benefit on theinitiation of substances in early adolescence, but these early protectiveeffects appear to have worn off, as they did for other symptom and functioning variables by the 8 year follow-up (Molina et al., 2009, JAACAP). We previously reported no significant associations betweenpast year stimulant treatment and substance use in early adolescence(Molina et al., 2007, JAACAP). Our current findings provide a carefully statistically controlled extension of those results at the age whenS38 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencesubstance use is ascending. Results suggest that prolonged stimulant treatment affords no visible protection from or predisposition toward adolescent substance use or SUD. A limitation of these findings is that the peak period of SUD risk in early adulthood has not occurred. Ifcomplete by December 2010, we will present the results of parallelanalyses with the 12-year data. Disclosure: B.S. Molina: None. The Impact of Childhood Stimulant Medication on Later Substance UseWilliam E. Pelham Jr.* Florida International University, Miami, FLBackground: Stimulant treatment of ADHD children has been commonplace for 40 years, and is currently recommended by influential professional organizations (e.g, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2007) as the first line and suffi-cient treatment for ADHD in childhood. At the same time, basicresearch on CNS drug effects in animals (e.g., behavioral sensiti- zation) suggests that childhood stimulant therapy for ADHD could theoretically exacerbate later drug use in ADHD individuals. Giventhat ADHD is a risk factor for later substance abuse, this concern has great public health significance. Prior studies in ADHD children that address this question have revealed mixed findings withsome suggesting that stimulants increase, decrease, and do not impactthe later substance use of ADHD children. The present study reports on the longest and largest continual follow up of an ADHD sample that has evaluated this relationship. The Pittsburgh ADHD Longi-tudinal Study (PALS), funded by NIDA and NIAAA, follows 364ADHD children and 240 controls into adolescence and young adulthood. This paper reports on stimulant treatment in the ADHD children and its relationship to later substance use in thePALS sample.Methods: ADHD children were ascertained in childhood as a function of their referral to a university clinic. Information about lifetime stimulant treatment was gathered using childhood intake records,doctor's records, and parent report. Substance use outcomes (marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco) were measured with standardized instruments through self-report. Ordinal and logistic regressionsexamined the effects of length of time medicated with stimulants onthe substance use outcome domains, controlling for a variety of childhood and concurrent measures (e.g., age, comorbid conduct problems, ongoing school functioning) that were thought to serve aspossible confounds.Results: Stimulants were used to treat 91% of the sample at some point in time, with the highest percentage medicated at grade 5 and a wide range of length of time medicated (0-16 years).For adolescents (age 11-17), longer stimulant use is not related to heavy use of alcohol, cigarette or marijuana when analyses control for current age. For young adults (age 18 + ), longer stimulant usepredicts higher use of all three substances - that is longer stimulant pharmacotherapy is associated with higher frequent use of the substances. Discussion: In contrast to earlier reports widely advertised by pharmaceutical companies, we can find no evidence that stimulantmedication taken in childhood and adolescence has a beneficial impact on ADHD children's substance use in adolescence and young adulthood. In contrast, we find no association in adolescence and anadverse effect in young adulthood. The implications of these results in light of findings from basic research on drug effects on animals and humans as well as current treatment of ADHD and alternatives to pharmacotherapy are discussed.Disclosure: W.E.

Iacono* University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MNBackground: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is comorbid with other childhood disruptive disorders (conduct andoppositional disorder), occurs in the offspring of substance abusingand antisocial parents, and is associated with the development of substance use disorders (SUDs) and antisociality. Factors that underlie these associations are not well understood. We hypothesize that agenetic vulnerability to behavioral disinhibition underlies theserelationships, and that gene-environment interplay over the course of development influences which of these combinations of externaliz- ing psychopathology are likely to arise in any given individual.Methods: Participants were drawn from the 1900 twin families that are part of the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research. Two cohorts were recruited, one older, consisting of 17-year-old twins andtheir biological mothers and fathers, and the other younger consistingof 11-year-old twins and their parents. Twins in both cohorts were followed up at regular intervals (3-4 years) spanning adolescence and young adulthood. In-person psychiatric interviews with parents andtheir twins covered childhood disruptive disorders when the twinswere younger and nicotine, alcohol, illicit drug use, and antisocial personality disorder when the twins were older. Participants were also underwent a two-hour psychophysiological assessment designed to tapputative endophenotypes associated with the development of sub- stance use and related disorders, including the P300 event related potential derived from the ''rotated heads'' task originally introducedby Begleiter and colleagues.Results: Parents with substance use disorders tend to have offspring at elevated risk for ADHD and each of the other externalizing disorders. Each of these disorders is moderately to highly heritable. Atage 17, the covariance among externalizing traits and disorders can bemodeled as a highly heritable general liability for externalizing behavior. At age 11, the covariance among the three childhood disruptive disorders can be similarly modeled as a highly heritableexternalizing liability. At both ages, parent-offspring transmission reflects the influence of a general externalizing liability captured by substance use and antisociality in parents and expressed in offspringas childhood disruptive disorders (at age 11) and substance useand antisocial disorders (at age 17). P300 amplitude also shows moderate heritability; is associated with ADHD, substance use and abuse, and antisocial behavior; and forecasts the subsequent develop-ment of SUDs. The association between P300 amplitude andexternalizing disorders reflects shared genetic effects. Discussion: A highly heritable general liability, transmitted from parent to child, accounts in part for the association of ADHD withother childhood disruptive disorders and the eventual development ofSUDs. This general liability can be indexed as reduced amplitude of the P300 brain potential. The general liability manifest as the covariance among externalizing disorders and the P300 endophenotype providean alternative avenue for research aimed at uncovering the etiology of externalizing disorders by focusing on underlying mechanisms that tie them together. Molecular genetic studies focused on these phenotypesmay provide a particularly attractive supplement to studies focused onthe etiology of each disorder alone. Disclosure: W.G. Iacono, None. Decreased Motivation in ADHD Is Associated with Deficit in Dopamine Reward PathwayNora Volkow* National Institute on Drug Abuse, Bethesda, MDBackground: ADHD is typically characterized as a disorder of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity but there is increasingS39 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceevidence of deficits in motivation. Here we test the hypothesis that decreased function of the brain dopamine reward pathway is associated with decreased motivation in ADHD. Methods: To evaluate this hypothesis we assessed the correlation between the measures of dopamine D2/D3 receptor and dopaminetransporter availability (obtained using Positron [11C]raclopride the dopamine reward pathway (midbrain and nucleusaccumbens), and measures of trait motivation (assessed using theAchievement scale on the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire or MPQ) in 45 mever medicated ADHD participants and 41 matched controls.Results: Both D2/D3 receptors and DAT in midbrain and nucleus accumbens were lower in ADHD participants than in controls. The trait measure of motivation was lower in ADHD participants than in controls (11 \u00b15v s1 in ADHD participants, but not in controls. ADHD participants also had lowervalues in the Constraint factor and higher values in the NegativeEmotionality factor of the MPQ but did not differ in the Positive Emotionality factor - and none of these were correlated with the dopamine measures. In ADHD participants trait motivation was alsonegatively correlated with symptoms of inattention (CAARS A, E andSWAN-I). Discussion: These findings provide evidence that disruption of the dopamine reward pathway is associated with motivation deficitsin ADHD adults, which may contribute to attention deficits and supports the use of therapeutic interventions to enhance motivation in ADHD. It also supports the notion of a ''motivation deficit'' inADHD.Disclosure: N.D. Volkow, None. Panel Session Neuregulin Session 1: A Gene at the Crossroads of Synaptic Plasticity, Psychiatric Disorders, and the Self MedicationTheory Brook University, Stony Brook, NYNeuregulin 1 plays critical roles in trophic and synaptic processes in the brain. Therefore, isoforms and variants of this gene, whose products signal through the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, could influence psychiatric disease risk by perturbing brain develop-ment and/or synaptic plasticity. Nrg1 is emerging as a nodal element atthe confluence of key genetic and neurochemical networks; detailed dissections of which could offer important insights into the mechan- isms of various psychiatric disorders and their comorbidities, anduncover promising new targets for the development of next generation pharmacotherapies. Like the CHRNA7 gene, encoding ( a7 nAChRs), the NRG1 linked to schizophrenia and associated sensory-motor gating deficits.Interestingly, the prominence of nicotine addiction in schizophrenic patients may be related to evidence that gating deficits are normalized by nicotine self-administration. This observation is consistent with theevidence showing that presynaptic Type III Nrg1 is required forsustained enhancement of hippocampal transmission by nicotine and for axonal targeting of a7 nAChRs.

The heavy smoking frequently asso- ciated with schizophrenia is suggestive that patients smoke toautomedicate. have investigated how NRG-ErbB signaling mod-ulates neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity and neuronal network activity, biological functions proposed to be compromised in schizophrenia and that may be corrected by smoking. Morespecifically, our studies show that NRG-ErbB4 signaling regulates glutamatergic and dopaminergic synaptic transmission and plasticity, as well as neuronal network activity associated with working memory(i.e. gamma oscillations). We have used neurochemical, immunohis-tochemical, electrophysiological and approaches to inves- tigate how NRG-ErbB4 signaling reverses LTP and regulates gamma frequency oscillations in the hippocampus of wild-type mice and miceharboring mutations in the ErbB4 receptor. We found that NRG-1rapidly and dramatically stimulates hippocampal dopamine release, and that subsequent activation of D4 receptors (D4Rs) reverses LTP D4R agonist and theta pulse stimuli on LTP are blocked by several D4R antagonists (including clozapine), and are absent in D4R knockout mice. NRG-1 also enhances by approximately 20-fold thepower, but not frequency, of kainate-induced gamma oscillations inacute hippocampal slices. Consistent with these observations, receptors are restricted to GABAergic interneurons including parval- bumin-positive basket cells that andaccumulates at glutamatergic postsynaptic sites. ErbB4 mutant deficits, well as altered hippocampal synaptic plasticity and gamma oscillatory activity. The effects of NRG-1 on dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission/plasticity and gammaoscillatory power, and the selective expression of ErbB4 in GABAergic interneurons, could have important implications for understanding how imbalances in NRG-ErbB signaling contribute to the patho-physiology associated with schizophrenia. Interestingly, the nAChR-7and ErbB4 receptors have overlapping cellular expression patterns and are reported to modular similar biological processes, suggest- ing that the function of both pathways may overlap significantly.

NRG1 Signaling and Epistasis with ERBB4 and AKT1 Daniel Weinberger* National Institute of Mental Health, NIH, Bethesda, MD Background: NRG1 is a schizophrenia candidate gene and plays an important role in brain development and neural function. Schizophrenia is a complex disorder, with etiology likely due to epistasis between genes.We sought to examine epistasis between NRG1 and selected NMDA- glutamate pathway partners its effects, including ERBB4, AKT1, DLG4, NOS1, NOS1AP and to validate any epistatic interactions using imaging techniques in individuals with the interacting genotypes.Methods: We used machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to examine epistasis in a schizophrenia case-control sample (N \u00bc296/365) and then performed logistic regression on the variable importance measures (VIM) to confirm the significance of the interactions. fMRIduring the N back task was acquired in an independent sample ofnormal subjects (n \u00bc172) to test for the effect of clinically interacting genotypes on an intermediate biologic phenotype associated withS40 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceincreased risk for schizophrenia-cortical inefficiency (i.e. increased BOLD response for a fixed level of performance). Results: None of the individual markers showed significant association with schizophrenia after correction for multiple testing. However, weobserved interaction between NRG1 5 0and 30SNPs: rs4560751- rs3802160 (likelihood ratio test (LRT) p \u00bc0.00020) and schizophrenia which was validated using fMRI of working memory in healthy controls; carriers interaction with these and AKT1 (rs2494734) was observed interval 223.03; LRT p \u00bc0.042). These two- and three-way interactions were biologically validated via fMRI: healthy individuals carrying risk genotypes for NRG1 and ERBB4 , or these two together with AKT1 , were disproportionately less efficient in DLPFC processing. Lower- level interactions were not observed between NRG1 /ERBB4 -AKT1 in association or neuroimaging, interaction modulates downstream AKT1 signaling.We searched a schizophrenia genome-wide association study dataset (GAIN) and the dataset described by Need et al. (2009) for replication of epistasis. Imputation of our VIM SNPs in GAINcould not be performed as only one SNP participating in epistasiswas found in HapMap. Using flanking SNPs for our 5 0-30epistasis, we separatedatasets from Need et al, individuals carrying all 3 risk genotypes did show marginally increased risk for schizophrenia (OR \u00bc1.60, 95% CI 0.98, 2.61, p-value \u00bc0.062) versus those carrying no risk genotypes in the German sample and the Aberdeen Sample (LRT p-value \u00bc0.076) with individuals carrying all three risk genotypes showing increased risk (OR \u00bc1.91, 95% CI 0.98, 3.69, p-value \u00bc0.056). Conclusions: Our data suggest complex epistatic effects implicating a NRG1 molecular pathway in cognitive brain function and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. These results represent the first demonstration of the application of MLAs for identifying epistatic effects in psychiatric genetics and the first use of neuroimaging as anapproach to biological validation of clinical epistasis.Disclosure: D.

Self-Medicating with Tobacco in Individuals with ADHD and SchizophreniaJean Gehricke* Department of Pediatrics, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CASmoking prevalence rates have declined in the United States over the past 40 years but the proportion of smokers with psychiatric comorbidity has risen. According to the self-medication hypothesis, smoking rates in individuals with mental disorders are high because ofthe symptom-reducing effects of nicotine and other tobacco constituents.Studies suggest that individuals with schizophrenia and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are not only at a higher risk for smoking initiation and subsequent nicotine dependence, but also less successfulwith smoking cessation. In addition to reviewing evidence for the self-medication hypothesis of tobacco use in schizophrenia, findings will be presented from studies on the association between ADHD and smoking. These studies reveal the reinforcing effects of nicotine and tobaccosmoke on clinical symptoms, behavior and brain activity in individualswith ADHD and schizophrenia.

Because the genes involved are known, WS affords a privileged setting for investigating how genes are translated in thebrain to produce cognitive and behavioral features.Methods and Results: Using multimodal imaging (PET, MRI, MRS, fMRI, DTI), we have identified several fundamental aspects of the brain phenotype in Williams syndrome: 1) underlying the syndrome'shallmark visuospatial construction impairment, is a neurostructuralanomaly and adjacent neural hypofunction in the dorsal visual processing stream, as well as hippocampal involvement; 2) underlying the syndrome's hallmark social cognition and personality features, arestructural and functional anomalies in the insula and in the orbitofrontal cortex, an important affect and social regulatory region that participates in a fronto-amygdalar circuit found to be dysfunc-tional in WS; and 3) underlying several of these gray matter structuraland functional abnormalities are altered white matter axonal tracts (measured in vivo with MR diffusion tensor imaging). Identification of these brain phenotypes in WS has motivated two experiments aimed atlinking specific genes in 7q11.23, such as LIMK1, to the neural and behavioral features of the syndrome. First, in extremely rare individuals with small deletions that include only a subset of the genes deleted in classic WS_ LIMK1 and genes extending telomerically, but not GTF2IRD1 and GTF2I _we found reduced gray matter volume and activation in several dorsal stream regions, as was seen in classic WS. Because these individuals did not have GTF2IRD1 and GTF2I deleted, disruption of these genes does not appear to be necessary toproduce the observed hypofunction and reduced gray matter volume. Moreover, when analyses were restricted to six individuals with only LIMK1 and ELN deleted, we a found a similar pattern. Because ELN plays little part in neural organization, our findings strengthen the evidence for an important role of LIMK1 in the dorsal stream abnormalities and associated visuospatial impairment in WS. Second, and further implicating LIMK1 , we found that allelic variation in this gene is associated with reduced gray matter volume in the dorsal stream in a large cohort of healthy individuals (N \u00bc244, Po.001). Discussion: The incisive approach afforded by this known genetic abnormality and the specific cognitive/behavioral profile it produces in WS provides a unique opportunity for the study of neurogenetic, developmental mechanisms. The compelling evidence for LIMK1 as a candidate mechanism for the visuospatial cognition problems inWS is supported by the fact that this gene is important for neural development, including axon guidance, synapse maturation, and dendrite formation, abnormalities of which appear to contribute todorsal visual processing stream anomalies.

Warren* Emory University, Atlanta, GA Background: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the paradigm of how use the lessons learned from a single gene disorder to approach a more complex disorder such as autism. FXS is due to the functional absenceof the protein FMRP that regulates local protein synthesis, in anactivity dependent manner, by binding to key transcripts within the postsynaptic space. The absence of FMRP results in excess translation of these messages that in turn enhances AMPA receptor traffickingthereby weakening of the synaptic strength, which presumably leads tothe phenotype of intellectual disability and autism. To reduce the stimulatory signal to trigger translation, Group 1 mGluR receptor antagonists have been shown to ''balance'' the loss of the translationalrepressor FMRP and rescue FXS phenotypes in animal models. Methods: In order to identify additional small molecules that may have potential therapeutic use in FXS, we developed a Drosophila chemical library screen exploiting the lethality of dfmr1 -deficient flies on food containing excess glutamate. We screened 2,000 small molecules and drug in independent vials each containing 40 M of the test compound and 12 dfmr1 -deficient embryos and scored for survival. Results: Ten compounds were identified to reproducibly rescue glutamate lethality in the dfmr1 -deficient flies. GABA agonists and muscarinic agonists. Discussion: The loss of FMRP in FXS leads to activity-dependent over translation at the synapse. This results in the apparent outcome of excess glutamate excitatory activity, although the signals are down- stream of the glutamate receptor. Thus group 1 mGluR receptorantagonists can dampen this enhanced excitatory signaling. Likewise,the data reported here point to another approach to dampen excitatory neurons; activation of the GABA inhibitory pathway. Although a well established interaction, the use of GABA agonists in FXS had not beenwidely considered previously. Clinical trials are now underwayevaluating these compounds in patients with FXS.

Genetic Underpinnings of Autism Spectrum Disorders Hakon Hakonarson* Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PABackground: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a group of childhood neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders char-acterized by deficits in verbal communication, impairment of social interaction, and restricted and repetitive patterns of interests and behavior. Autism spectrum disorders affect as many as 1 in 150children, making it more common than pediatric cancer, diabetes, andAIDS combined. It occurs in all racial, ethnic, and social groups and is four times more likely to strike boys than girls. ASD has debilitating consequences for the affected individual and entails great burden tothe individual's family and to society as a whole. Although there have been concerted efforts to define the causes and best treatments for ASD, until very recently, progress has been quite limited.Methods: We used Genome-wide association (GWA) approach to identify association to both common and rare variants in the human genome. Results: We report the first confirmed genetic susceptibility locus for ASDs, as well as a group of individually rare copy number variants thatbelong to specific gene pathways, in particular, gene networks involving neuronal cell adhesion molecules and ubiquitin family of genes showing variations, both common and rare, that predispose toASDs.Discussion: These new discoveries, when coupled to high-throughput sequencing approaches of the human exome and ultimately the entiregenome are likely to lead to new and improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to more effectively treat ASDs and related neurodevelopmental disorders.

Hakon Hakonarson University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PABackground: Mental illnesses emerge during childhood and adoles- cence and many persisting into adulthood. To prevent or intervene inthis pathway it is essential to identify premorbid risk factors and early manifestations of these conditions. An integrative approach is required to elucidate genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, whichshape neurodevelopmental trajectories. Linking disease phenotypes and intermediate variables, modulating disease manifestations in genetically susceptible individuals, will help articulate how thesefactors contribute to shaping the development of brain systems thatunderlie complex behavior. The ability to obtain quantitative phenotypic measures of brain and behavior affords bridging molecular biology with the phenomenology of disease. Large phenotypicallyand genomically characterized samples are required for reliableprogress. A collaboration between the Center for Applied Genomics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Brain Behavior Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania capitalizes on anunprecedented opportunity: an already genotyped large sample ofchildren and adolescents, who have consented to being contacted for further research. Methods: A cohort of 10,000 genotyped children and adolescents, age range 8-21, from the greater Philadelphia area are being characterized phenotypically and assessed along behavioral dimen- sions indicating vulnerability to major mental illnesses.

Integrative analyses of the genomic, epigenetic, imaging 49th Annual ConferencePanel Session Novel Targets for the Development of Medicines for theTreatment of Tobacco Dependence Translational Approaches for Nicotine Dependence: Utility of Genetically Modified MiceChristie D. Fowler*, Jonathan Hollander, Paul Kenny The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FLBackground: Tobacco addiction imposes a significant negative impact on health worldwide; however, attempts to quit smoking are most often unsuccessful. Currently available smoking cessation therapeutics demonstrate limited effectiveness with reported adverse side effectsbeing of concern. Thus, a pressing need exists to develop noveltherapeutics for efficacious and safe smoking cessation. Methods: Genetically modified mice are powerful tools for under- standing the mechanics of drug addiction and are revealing importantinsights into the actions of nicotine in the brain. Recently, we developed a reliable mouse intravenous nicotine self-administration procedure to more directly examine addiction-related mechanismsthrough the use of genetically modified mice.Results: Using the mouse self-administration procedure, we assessed volitional nicotine intake in mice with null mutation in acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit gene ( access to a range of nicotine doses, the a5 knockout mice exhibited dramatically increased intake compared with wildtype mice, particu- larly when higher unit doses of available. lentivirus-mediated re-expression of a5 nAChR subunits the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway completely ''rescued'' this phenotype. These findings suggest that a5-containing (denoted a5*) nAChRs regulate nicotine intake through a novel mechanism independent of the midbrain dopamine systems classicallyimplicated in reward and addiction, the major neuroanatomical target for available smoking cessation agents. Interestingly, the a5* nAChR partial a5* nAChRs may be important targets for the development of novel smoking cessation pharmacotherapeutics. In the second series of experiments, we examined nicotine self- administration behavior in mice with null mutation in the hypo-cretin-1 receptor (Hcrt-1; also termed orexin-1) gene ( HCRTR1 ). In contrast to the a5 knockout mice, Hcrt-1 knockout mice displayed significantly decreased nicotine intake compared to wildtype litter- mates across a range of doses. Further, the Hcrt-1 receptor antagonistSB-334867 also decreased nicotine intake and attenuated nicotine- induced lowering of brain-stimulation reward thresholds in rats. Thus, Hcrt-1 receptors may also be an important target for development ofnovel smoking cessation agents.Discussion: Together, these findings reveal fundamental insights into the mechanisms of nicotine reinforcement and provide a foundation for further development of clinically efficacious therapeutics.Disclosure: C.D.

Goldberg University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, Preclinical Pharmacology Section, Intramural Research Program, National Institute on DrugAbuse, Baltimore, MD, Department of Psychiatry, University ofMaryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, B.B. Brodie Department of Neuroscience, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy Endogenous cannabinoid signaling is known to be involved in nicotine addiction, but the functions of specific endocannabinoid transmittersin the abuse-associated effects of nicotine have long remained unclear.This gap has recently been filled by the discovery of drugs that block the degradation of the major endocannabinoids operating in the brain - anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. It has been shown that pharmacological inhibitors of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), selectively magnify theintrinsic modulatory actions of this transmitter on brain circuits that control pain and emotion. Indeed, several compounds in this class have been recently advanced to clinical testing for the treatment ofpain. Experiments in rats have shown that one of these compounds,called URB597, markedly reduces both the rewarding effects of nicotine and the drug's ability to increase dopamine release in the shell of the nucleus accumbens, a core component of the reward system in thebrain. Studies in squirrel monkeys have further demonstrated thatURB597 reverses nicotine self-administration and prevents nicotine- induced reinstatement, a model of relapse into nicotine use. These findings suggest that FAAH inhibition counteracts the addictiveproperties of nicotine, and point to FAAH as a novel molecular target for tobacco dependence. Disclosure: D. Piomelli, None. Restoring Glutamate Athina Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, Med Univ So Carolina, Charleston, SC, UC San Diego, La Jolla, SC Background: Addiction to drugs of abuse is characterized by relapse to drug taking. The regulation of synaptic plasticity by the eliminationand release of glutamate from glia is disrupted by chronic use of addictive drugs, including cocaine and heroin. The physiological regulation of synaptic plasticity by glia has been termed glutamatehomeostasis. In rats trained to self-administer cocaine or heroin,impaired glutamate homeostasis can be ameliorated by administering drugs that increase cystine-glutamate exchange and glial glutamate transport, including N-acetylcysteine and ceftriaxone, respectively. Aswell, N-acetylcysteine reduces both craving and relapse in cocaine addicted participants in double-blind clinical trials. However, it is unknown if nicotine addiction shares these characteristics with cocaineand heroin.Methods: Two general experiments were performed. In the first, rats were trained to self-administer nicotine and following a 21-day self- adminstration protocol, the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmentalwere dissected from the brain in order to measure the membraneexpression of the catalytic subunit of the cystine-glutamate exchange, xCT, and the levels of the glial glutamate transporter, GLT-1. The second study was a double-blind pilot clinical study was thenconducted to determine if restoring cystine-glutamate exchange with N-acetylcysteine inhibits cigarette use. Twenty-nine subjects were recruited and administered either 1200 mg of N-acetylcysteine bid orplacebo over 4 weeks.Results: The levels of xCT and GLT-1 were significantly reduced in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area, but not in the amygdala or prefrontal cortex, of rats trained to self-administernicotine compared to yoked-saline controls. Also, after 4 weeks ofdaily treatments, participants in the N-acetylcysteine treatment group were smoking 25-30% fewer cigarettes than placebo-treated subjects. Discussion: These data indicate that, akin to chronic cocaine administration, repeated use of nicotine impairs glutamate home-ostasis. Also, by restoring glutamate homeostasis with N-acetyl- cysteine it was possible to reduce daily cigarette use in treatment- seeking smokers. Thus, nicotine use follows a similar pattern ofneuropathology as cocaine and heroin use, and ameliorating this pathology reduces human nicotine abuse, as it does for cocaine abuse.Disclosure: P. Kalivas, ACNP 49th Annual the Motivation for Nicotine During Abstinence in Nicotine Dependent Animals Olivier George* Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, CABackground: The main psychoactive ingredient responsible for tobacco addiction has long been hypothesized to be nicotine. Nicotineacutely produces modest positive reinforcing effects by activating thereward systems, including the mesolimbic dopamine system. However this mechanism is not sufficient to explain the transition from nicotine use to nicotine dependence. Nicotine dependence has been hypothe-sized to result from neuroadaptative changes in the brain that producea powerful need to continue tobacco use. Such neuroadaptation may involve the mechanisms responsible for the negative emotional states observed during abstinence and represent a powerful source ofnegative reinforcement leading to excessive drug intake. Recruitment of an anti-reward system, such as stress-regulatory extrahypothalamic corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) via activation of CRF1 receptors,may contribute significantly to the motivation for compulsive use oftobacco, defined as use driven by negative reinforcement. This talk highlights recent animal studies from our laboratory showing that activation of the extrahypothalamic CRF-CRF1 system during absti-nence from chronic nicotine mediates the aversive response to nicotinewithdrawal, and the excessive nicotine intake and anxiety-like symptoms observed after abstinence in rodents. Methods: We used defensive burying to measure anxiety-like behavior, conditioned place preference to measure the motivational response to nicotine and withdrawal, and intravenous self-administration to measure nicotine intake in rats and mice that have been acutely orchronically exposed to nicotine.Results: Blockade of the CRF1R prevents spontaneous nicotine withdrawal aversions and abstinence-induced increases in nicotine self-administration and in anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, blockadeof the CRF1R does not prevent the rewarding response to nicotine inchronic nicotine treated mice or the aversive response to nicotine in acute nicotine treated mice. Discussion: These results suggest that dependent rats may increase their nicotine intake after abstinence to obtain relief from the resulting CRF-CRF1 receptor-mediated negative emotional state. This CRF1 receptor-dependent mode of negative reinforcement may explain thechronic relapsing feature of nicotine addiction and represent theneurobiological equivalent of a subject ''hooked'' on tobacco. The recruitment of such anti-reward systems may critically explain the transition from drug use to drug dependence and suggest newtargets for non-nicotine pharmacotherapy to aid smoking andsmokeless tobacco cessation.

Panel Session Alzheimer's Revisited: Understanding Tomorrow to Remember Yesterday Treating Alzheimer's: Where We Have Been and Where We Are GoingPierre Tariot* Banner Alzheimer's Institute, Phoenix, AZThe major trials in AD have been or are based on clinical rationales and/or translatable biomarkers and have varied in the extent to which they have adequately tested hypotheses about the pathobiology of AD. The main therapeutic approaches in play will be summarized briefly,including neurotransmitter, glial modulation, neuroptrotective/neuro-trophic, amyloid, and tau/tangle based therapies, and results from selected trials will be presented along with key elements of ongoing trials. A neuronal nicotinic receptor partial agonist that showedefficacy in animal models of cognition was studied in a novel adaptive randomization design showing absence of clinical benefit in AD. A RAGE antagonist with evidence of effects on A beta metabolism and glial function is currently under study. The putative mitochondrialstabilizer latreperdine (dimebon) showed positive effects in an earliertrial and negative effects in a recent phase 3 trial; ongoing phase 3 trials will be described. The antiamyloid monoclonal antibody bapinuezu- mab showed trends in clinical outcomes in a phase 2 trial, decreasedfibrillar amyloid binding on PiB PET scans, and vasogenic edema in aminority of subjects; ongoing phase 3 trials will be described. IVIG showed encouraging clinical and biomarkers data in a phase 2 trial; the current phase 3 trial will be summarized. Phase 2 data for a gammasecretase inhibitor showed reduced production of beta amyloid in CSF,leading to a current phase 3 trial. An amyloid anti-aggregating agent is in phase 2. Valproate inhibits GSK3 in vitro , leading to the hope of clinically relevant antitangle effects in AD that were not seen in a phase3 trial. Other agents of note will be summarized, including tarenflurbil, tramiprostae, omega 3 fatty acid, statins, glitazones, and lithium. It is possible that treating before symptoms and pathology are evident maybe more effective. Initial prevention trials with NSAID's and ginkgohave not shown benefit, although late data from the largest NSAID trial offer intriguing hints. A particular challenge is that typical prevention trials require thousands of patients and many years toobtain an answer. The Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative (API) is acollaborative program that aims to implement proof of concept prevention and therapeutic surrogate development studies in non- demented individuals at increased genetic risk for developingAlzheimer's disease, including presenilin 1 (PS1) carriers in a remarkably large kindred in Antioquia, Colombia, in partnership with Francisco Lopera and his colleagues, and APOE4 homozygotes.Established biomarkers of AD progression and pathology will becharacterized within these trials as to the extent to which a treatment's biomarker effects predict a clinical benefit before regulatory agencies will support the use of suitable biomarkers as ''reasonably likelysurrogate endpoints'' in the AstraZeneca, Baxter, Bristol Myers Squibb, Forest, Elan, Wyeth, Janssen, Medavante. c-Secretase Dysfunction in Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease and a Signaling Pathway for Therapeutic Modulation of c-Secretase Function at the SynapseSamuel E. Gandy* Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NYBackground: The pathogenesis of most familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) involves dysfunction of g-secretase, which, in turn, causes elevation of the A b42/40 ratio, favoring the assembly of neurotoxic A b oligomers. We investigated the possibility that multiple g-secretase substrates might be misprocessed in subjects with sporadic AD. Further, we have investigated the regulation of A bspeciation at the synapse. Together, these studies provide novel insights into thepathogenesis and potential therapy of sporadic AD.Methods: Using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, we analyzed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of various clinical populations the peptide products generated by processing of not only APP but also anunrelated g-secretase substrate protein, alcadein (Alc). Alternatively, in our therapeutic studies, we have dissected the subtypes of metabo- tropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) that modulate synaptic A b40 and 42 generation.Results: In the diagnostic part of the study, the CSF covariance plots from elderly nondemented and other neurological disease control subjects were found to be negative in slope and indistinguishable fromS44 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceeach other, while the covariance plot for SAD patients was positive in slope and readily distinguishable the plots from either control subject group. In the therapeutic part of the study, stimulation of postsynaptic Group I mGluR with DHPG induced transient accumula-tion in the releasate of A b40 but not A b42. Following stimulation with the Group II mGluR agonist DCG-IV, we observed sustained accumulation of A b42 in the releasate, which could be blocked by a Group II mGluR antagonist. DAPT-sensitivity was employed toestablish that this A bgeneration was likely to be due to the same g-secretase activity that generates the peptide under normal physio- logical conditions. Conclusions: The CSF results raise the possibility that the molecular pathogenesis of SAD might involve g-secretase dysfunction despite the absence of a PS1 mutation. The therapeutic program points to a potential intervention that addresses precisely the g-secretase dysfunc- tion implicated by the CSF data and reveals a new strategy fordevelopment of selective A b42-lowering agents. We propose that suppressing Group II mGluR signaling might be a viable prophylactic or therapeutic strategy for AD by selectively reducing synapticproduction and release of A b42. This is an especially attractive class of compounds because of their reported ability to enhance hippo- campal cognitive function and neurogenesis Amicus Pharmaceuticals, Part 4. Predictive Performance of CSF Biomarkers for Conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease Leslie M. Shaw*, John Q. Trojanowski University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA Background: Qualification of imaging and biochemical biomarkers for use in detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology is of increasing interest in academic, pharmaceutical, and regulatory disciplines. Thereare accumulating data that support the hypothesis that early detection(risk for AD) of disease pathology is possible at the pre-dementia stage of the disease when the clinical diagnosis is less certain. Here we summarize our experience in the qualification of CSF Amyloid beta42(Abeta42), total tau (t-tau) and tau phosphorylated in the 181 threonineposition (p-tau181). Methods: platform bead-basedcapture antibodies and reagents, AlzBio3, Ghent, Belgium) in this study. For analytical qualification we performed an interlaboratory quality assessment study and documented reproducibility during atotal of 38 analytical runs: %CV subject CSF Abeta42, t-tau and p-tau181, respectively. For clinical qualification of this analytical system, we first established threshold CSF biomarker concentrations for ADdetection using pre-mortem CSF samples collected from subjectsdiagnosed with AD at autopsy and an age-matched cognitively normal control (CN) group (all samples provided by the UPenn Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Core). We used Receiver Operating Charac-teristic curve analyses to determine threshold ''cut-point'' concen- trations that effectively discriminated between AD and CN subjects and then applied the same analytical methodology for biomarkerconcentrations in CSF collected from 410 subjects enrolled in theAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) at baseline. For assessments of the predictive performance of CSF biomarkers, biomarker ratios and a logistic regression model that includedAbeta42, and APOE genotype (LRTAA) we applied data and the non-ADNI subject-based disease detection cutpoints we confirmed the expected significantly decreasedCSF Abeta and increased tau concentrations in 100 AD subjectscompared to the 114 CN subjects and intermediate abnormalities of these biomarkers in the 196 ADNI subjects who provided CSF at entryinto the study. For the 37 MCI subjects who converted to a clinical diagnosis of AD within 12 months of entry into the study the incidence of an AD-like biomarker profile was 86.5%, 89% and Using Kaplan-Myer survival analyseseach of these three biomarker measures provided conversion prediction based on the established cutpoints (respective p values of 0.0005,o0.0001 and 0.0001). Discussion: These study data provide, in a large multicenter investiga- tion, support for the hypothesis that CSF biomarkers can provide a basis for establishing in MCI subjects the risk for conversion to a clinical diagnosis of probable AD. Such information may be useful to establishrisk-based cohorts in future treatment trials. Essential to the use of CSFbiomarker measurements in this context is use of highly standardized analytical methodology and associated pre-analytical factors. Further characterization of the clinical utility of CSF biomarkers over longerperiods of followup in the ADNI MCI subjects is underway including evaluations of combinations with imaging biomarkers.

Imaging Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease: Current Concepts Clifford Jack* Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MNBiomarkers of brain A bamyloidosis are reductions in CSF Ab42 and increased amyloid PET tracer retention. Biomarkers of neuronalinjury and neurodegeneration are elevated CSF tau and structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging measures of cerebral atrophy. Neuro- degeneration is accompanied by synaptic dysfunction, which isreflected by decreased Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PositronEmission Tomography. A recently proposed model relating disease stage to Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers posits that (1) A b amyloid biomarkers become abnormal first, before neurodegenerativebiomarkers and before cognitive symptoms, (2) neurodegenerative biomarkers become abnormal later and correlate with clinical symp- tom severity. This proposed sequential ordering of AD biomarkersdetermines the practical utility of different imaging measures atspecific stages of the AD pathological cascade. Disclosure: C.R. Jack, None.

Bonci, None.S45 ACNP 49th Annual ConferenceExtended Access to Rapidly Delivered IV Cocaine Changes Brain and Behavior in Ways That May Increase Liability to Addiction Terry Robinson* University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MIIntroduction: Many people use potentially addictive drugs but very few go on the develop addiction. A key question is addiction research,therefore, is what is responsible for the transition from recreational orcircumstantial drug use to the compulsive patterns of drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior that characterizes addiction? There is increasing recognition that to study this question using animal modelsrequires the use of procedures that result in the development ofaddiction-like symptoms. There are now a number of reports that one way to achieve this aim is to allow animals extended access to drugs, either by increasing the amount of time drug is available each day, orby allowing animals to self-administer drugs for months at a time. Rats allowed extended access to drugs like cocaine undergo a transition from the ''controlled'' pattern of intake seen when they have onlylimited access, to a pattern of intake associated with a number ofsymptoms of addiction. Another factor thought to increase liability to addiction is the rate that drug reaches the brain. Drugs, formulations and routes of administration that lead to the rapid uptake of drugto the brain are thought to increase liability to addiction. Thispresentation will review studies on how these factors interact to alter brain and behavior in ways that may contribute to addiction. Methods: Behavioral (e.g., self-administration; measure of attention), molecular (gene expression) and anatomical (analysis of dendritic structure) methods are combined to study persistent effects of cocaine on brain and behavior.Results: Only when rats were given extended access to cocaine did they develop a number of changes in brain and behavior that may contribute to addiction. For example, addicts show a number of persistent cognitive deficits that impair judgment and decision-making, but it has beendifficult to demonstrate these in rats given limited access to cocaine.However, when given extended access r ats show very persistent deficits on a sustained attention task charact erized by a disruption in cognitive flexibility, and this is associated w ith persistent changes D2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, extended access to cocaine produces especially robust behavioral sensitiz ation and marked structural changes in dendrites on medium spiny neuron s in the core of the accumbens. The rapid delivery of i.v. cocaine also pro duces especially ro bust behavioral sensitization and has a greater impac t on the brain, relative to when it is delivered slower, but interestingly , under limited access conditions the rate of cocaine delivery has essentially no influence on self-administration behavior. However, when tested und er extended access conditions we recently found that the rate of cocai ne delivery has profound effects on self-administration behavior. Only animals in which cocaine was delivered rapidly greatly increas ed their intake when they were given the opportunity to take more cocaine, and these animals were also moreprone to reinstate drug-seeking behav ior after a long period of abstinence. The latter effect was also a ssociated with persisten t changes in the ability o fc o c a i n et oi n d u c et h ei m m e d i a t ee a r l yg e n e ,c - f o s .Discussion: The importance of these results for thinking about how the rate of drug delivery and extended access to drugs contribute to liability to addiction will be discussed.Disclosure: T.E. Robinson, None. Neural Mechanisms Underlying the Development of Compulsive Cocaine Seeking HabitsBarry J. Everitt* University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United KingdomDrug addiction can be viewed as the e ndpoint of a series of transitions from initial, voluntary drug use through loss of control over this behaviorsuch that it is ultimately instantiated as a compulsive habit. Based on functional imaging data in humans and the experimental analysis of drug seeking and taking behavior in animals, we have hypothesized that theswitch from controlled to compulsive dr ug seeking represents a transition at the neural level from prefrontal co rtical to striatal control over drug seeking and drug taking behavior, a s well as a progression from ventral to more dorsal domains of the stri atum, mediated by its serially interconnecting dopaminergic circuitry. Data will be presented thatsupport the notion of a transition from ventral to dorsal striatal control over drug seeking and its dependence on the spiraling dopaminergic circuitry that links ventral with dorsa l striatal areas. The dorsal striatal dominant control over drug seeking emerges as the behavior becomesprogressively well established and habitual. However, a key issue for animal experimental studies of addictive behavior is the measurement of compulsive drug seeking. We have es tablished a model of compulsive drug seeking, defined as persisten c ei nt h ef a c eo fa v e r s i v eo u t c o m e s (reminiscent of the DSMIV diagnostic c riterion) using a cocaine seeking- taking chained schedule in which seek ing responses are intermittently and unpredictably punished, but the chained taking response alwaysdelivers intravenous cocaine. We h ave shown that a consistent 20% or so of rats develop compulsive drug seek ing behavior after an extended, but not a short, cocaine taking history. Highly impulsive rats, that we haveearlier shown to have low D2/3 dopamine receptor binding potential inthe ventral striatum compared to lo w impulsive rats and to more readily escalate their cocaine intake, are al so highly represented in the group that compulsively seeks cocaine. T hese data suggest that impulsivity predisposes animals to compulsively seek and take cocaine after prolonged exposure to the drug. Rat s that compulsively seek cocaine h a v e ,i na d d i t i o nt oa ne x p e c t e dr e d u c t i o ni ni n d i c e so fs t r i a t a ld o p a m i n e transmission in the dorsal striatum post mortem , also have a marked r e d u c t i o ni np r e f r o n t a lc o r t i c a la n d striatal serotonin transmission. Treatment of rats that compulsively seek cocaine with a 5-HT2 receptor agonist decreases this complusive c ocaine seeking, while treatment of rats with a 5-HT2 receptor antagonis t results in cocaine seeking despite punishment in animals even after a short cocaine taking history. These data have implications for understan ding the transition from controlled to compulsive drug seeking in addiction.Disclosure: B.J. Everitt, GSK, Part 1. Understanding Dopamine's Role in Drug Abuse and Addiction: Insights from ImagingNora Volkow* National Institute on Drug Abuse, Bethesda, MDBackground: Dopamine (DA) is associated with drug reward and is believed to be involved in addiction. However, Schulz and collaborators have shown that dopamine cells are not only involved with reward but also with prediction of reward so that while dopamine increasesoccur with initial exposure to a primary reward with repeated exposurethe dopamine cells will no longer fire with the primary reward but to the conditioned stimuli that predict the reward. Here we test the hypothesis that cocaine addicted subjects will show an attenuation ofthe DA increases induced by the drug but an enhanced response tococaine-cues. Methods : Positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]raclopride were used to assess change in DA induced by intravenousmethylphenidate (stimulant that like cocaine increases DA by blocking DA transporters) in active and in detoxified cocaine abusers and compared these responses to those in controls. In parallel we have alsoused PET to assess the responses of active cocaine abusers to cocainecues (cocaine-cues video). Results : We showed that DA increases induced by methylphenidate were markedly attenuated in cocaine addicts when compared withcontrols and that these differences were most accentuated in the activecocaine abusers. Moreover in active cocaine abusers the effects of MP did not differ from those in placebo. In contrast in active cocaine abusers conditioned drug-related stimuli induced significant increasesin DA that were associated with cocaine craving.Discussion : These findings show that as predicted by preclinical studies, as drug abuse transitions to addiction the increases in DA onceS46 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceinduced by the reward (the drug) itself are transferred to stimuli that predict the reward and drive the compulsive drug seeking behavior characteristic of addiction.

Panel Session Common Factors in the Progression and Treatment ofBipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia The Relationship of NRG1 to Initial and Progressive Neural Change in Schizophrenia Nancy Andreasen*, Beng-Choon Ho, Thomas Wassink University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA Background: Brain changes (i.e., GM and WM loss, increase in CSF) occur in schizophrenia both prior to and after onset. NRG1 has been replicated in multiple studies as a potential susceptibility gene forschizophrenia. It has functions that are potentially relevant forunderstanding the mechanisms that may drive brain changes in schizophrenia either prior to or after onset. It produces proteins that affect axon guidance, myelination, glial differentiation, synaptogenesis,and neurotransmission.Methods: We used an Illumina candidate gene chip custom-designed for genetic studies of psychiatric disorders. We examined tag SNPs in patients from the Iowa Longitudinal Study of Schizophrenia,a prospective study of first episode patients, who have been followedusing repeated structural Magnetic Resonance (sMR) scans for up to 15 years. Previous analyses of these data in 153 patients and 103 controls has demonstrated that 1) patients scanned at intakehave evidence of brain tissue loss both globally and in specific regions (e.g., frontal lobes, thalamus), as compared with controls; and 2) patients also show evidence of additional brain tissue loss over time.To determine the potential role of NRG1 polymorphisms in these brain changes, we examined them in relation to sMR measures obtained at intake, and to a percent change over time. sMR measures were obtained using a locally developed fully-automated analysiswith BRAINS2. We analyzed the intake data using a GLM to examinebetween allele combinations and covaried for sex and age. We analyzed the follow-up data by calculating a percent change between intake and follow-up and then used a GLM to examine between-allele combinations, covarying for sex and number of years of surveillance . Results: Multiple NRG1 SNPs were associated with brain abnormalities in first episode patients at onset, suggesting that they may haveaffected developmental brain processes occurring prior to the occurrence of symptoms. The number of significant associations increased between intake and follow-up, suggesting that NRG1 polymorphisms may also play a role in ongoing neuroprogressivechanges after onset. Effects were greatest in WM and in frontal lobes and the thalamus at both intake and follow-up, a finding consistent with NRG1 's role in myelination, glial formation, synaptogenesis, and neuroplasticity. At follow-up an increased number of relationships were also found between NRG1 polymorphisms and indicators of more diffuse neuropathy (e.g. overall decrease in cerebral size, increase ofcortical CSF and VBR).Discussion: These multiple genetic polymorphisms may affect NRG1 's role in mediating multiple brain developmental processes, such that brain morphology is altered in ways that lead to in increasedsusceptibility to develop schizophrenia and ongoing progression afteronset. The initial and progressive loss of WM is of particular interest, given the various roles that NRG1 plays in myelination and glial differentiation. NRG1 has also been shown to regulate thalamocortical axon projection through the striatum to the frontal cortex. SignificantSNPs are frequently located in introns; their effect may be exerted through producing abnormalities in splicing or by affecting geneexpression, transcript stability, or aberrant isoform production. Future directions will include an examination of epistasis with other candidate genes such as ERBB4, DISC1 , and BDNF . Disclosure: N.C.

Rao* National Institute on Aging, NIH, Bethesda, MDBackground: Bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are severe, debilitating psychiatric disorders. Severity of symptoms over time,progression and cognitive decline are common in both illnesses. Insuch conditions, an increased arachidonic acid (AA) cascade signaling associated with upregulated neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity markers with reduced synaptic loss are widespread, similar to thosereported in Alzheimer's pathology. On this basis, we tested thehypothesis that BD and SZ are associated with increased AA cascade and neuroinflammatory markers and excitatory markers, with synaptic loss.Methods: To do this, we used Western blotting and RT-PCR to compare protein and mRNA levels of AA cascade markers, neuroin- flammatory, glutamate transporters and synaptic markers in post-mortem frontal 10 BD, 10 SZ patients and 20 matchedcontrols. Results: Mean protein BD and patients. Whereas, protein and mRNA glial protein acidic protein, Cd11b were the illnesses. Excitatory amino acidtransporter (EAAT)-2 protein and mRNA were reduced in postmortemfrontal cortex from BD patients but not in SZ patients. Whereas, protein and mRNA levels of EAAT (3 and 4) were upregulated in SZ but not in BD patients. In addition, reduced synaptophysin anddrebrin were found in postmortem frontal cortex from BD and SZ patients. Discussion: The discrepancy in glutamate transporters levels in SZ patients explains SZ might be associated with hypoglutamatergicfunction, while BD is associated with hyperglutamatergic function. Increased neuroinflammation with upregulated AA cascade enzymes might lead to disease progression and cognitive defects in BD and SZpatients. Thus, down regulating this cascade might be considered fornew therapy. Disclosure: J.S. Rao, None. Effects of Antipsychotic Medications on Cellular and Molecular Features of the Cerebral Cortex David Lewis* Western Psychiatric Institute & Clinic, Pittsburgh, PA Background: Both in vivo and post-mortem investigations of brain morphology in schizophrenia have demonstrated smaller volumes of the whole brain and of certain brain regions. In addition, post-mortemstudies have revealed evidence suggestive of oligodendrocyte andmyelination alterations and consistently found disturbances in the expression of genes that regulate GABA neurotransmission in individuals with schizophrenia,. However, it is unclear whetherprolonged treatment with antipsychotic medications contributes tothese disturbances. Methods: To investigate this question, we developed a non-human primate model of chronic antipsychotic exposure. Three groups of 6macaque monkeys each were exposed to oral haloperidol, olanzapineor sham for B2 years. The resulting plasma drug levels were comparable to those seen in subjects with schizophrenia treated withS47 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencethese medications. We used highly precise measures to determine regional brain volumes, unbiased stereological methods to determine total numbers of all classes of cortical neurons, including total oligodendrocyte and astrocyte numbers, and several methods to assesslevels of gene expression. Some studies were also conducted in animalsexposed chronically to higher serum levels of haloperidol decanoate and matched controls. Results: After the exposure, we observed an 8-11% reduction in mean fresh brain weights as well as left cerebrum fresh weights and volumesin both drug-treated groups compared to sham animals. The differences were observed across all major brain regions, but appeared most robust in the frontal and parietal regions. The use of pointcounting and Cavalieri's principle on Nissl-stained sections confirmeda 14-15% reduction in the left parietal grey matter volumes of the antipsychotic-exposed monkeys. Use of the optical fractionator method to estimate the number of each type of cortical cell revealedno differences in total neuron number across subject groups, a concomitant 10.2% increase in neuron density in the antipsychotic- exposed monkeys and significant mean 14.2% reduction in glial cellnumber. Immunocytochemical studies in the antipsychotic-exposed monkeys. Similar effects were seen in both the haloperidol and olanzapine groups. In contrast,no differences in GABA-related gene expression were seen across anyof the conditions. Discussion: Together, the findings of smaller cortical grey matter volume, lower glial cell number, and higher neuron density without adifference in total neuron number in the antipsychotic-exposed monkeys parallel the results of postmortem studies of schizophrenia, and raise the possibility that observations in human subjects might bedue, at least in part, to medication effects. In contrast, these findingssuggest that the GABA-related transcript abnormalities in the illness do not represent an antipsychotic medication effect. Disclosure: D.A.

By Dampening Its Upregulated Brain Arachidonic Cascade, Mood Stabilizers and Atypical Antipsychotics May Slow Bipolar DisorderProgressionStanley Rapoport* National Institute on Aging, NIH, Bethesda, MDBackground: A common factor regarding the mechanism of action of anti-bipolar disorder (BD) drugs and neuropathology leading to BD progression may involve the brain arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) cascade. Studies described by J Rao in this panel indicate increasedexpression of neuroinflammation receptors or synaptic glutama- tergic NMDA receptors, and high AA concentrations are neurotoxic and can contribute to apoptosis and disease progression.Methods: In vivo kinetics in rodent models, lipid analytical chemistry, molecular biology, enzyme activity analyses, post-mortem brain sampling. Results: Approved BD therapy appears to target some of these BD changes, since lithium, valproate, carbamazepine and lamotrigine(unpublished), when given chronically to rats to produce therapeuti- cally relevant blood concentrations, each downregulated parts of the brain AA cascade, including: cPLA2, sPLA2 and/or COX-2 expression,AA incorporation from turnover in brain phospho-lipid, AA-selective acyl-CoA synthetase activity, and concentrations of AA and its metabolite, pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).Each mood stabilizer also blocked the robust brain AA signal, imaged using quantitative autoradiography in unanesthetized rats, seen following intraperitoneal administration of a subconvulsive dose of NMDA (signal also was blocked by MK-801). Unpublished studies nowindicate that two effective atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine andclozapine, reduced AA incorporation into brain secondary to lowering the unesterified plasma AA concentration in unanesthetized rats, brain COX mRNA and activity and PGE2 concentration. Expression of braincPLA2 and sPLA2 was unaffected, while of mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics to downregulate parts of the rat brain AA cascadeprovides a possible mechanism for their therapeutic efficacy in BD, in which an upregulated cascade associated with neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity likely contributes to disease progression.Disclosure: S.I.

Brown, Mark Rapaport, Thomas Kosten University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MIBackground: Protection of individuals who participate in research is overseen by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), usually local,independent entities that review human research to ensure that participants are not harmed, exploited or subjected to unnecessary risks. Established by Federal regulations, IRBs are required for allfederally-sponsored research, as well as studies that involve drugs andmedical devices. In practice, IRBs exercise oversight over all research at institutions receiving federal support. In the last decade, investiga- tors have seen a sharp increase in the amount of time spent assuringcompliance with research regulations, and institutions have devotedincreasingly larger budgets to operate IRBs. Because of concerns about the growing burden that IRBs place on investigators, the Council of the ACNP charged the Human Subjects Committee with surveying themembership to determine the extent of this burden, and to identify potential solutions. Methods: From September through October of 2009, a web-based survey was made available to the membership of ACNP. 143 membersresponded to the survey, which represents 40.9 % of members self- identified as clinical researchers, out of a total membership of 887. Results: Respondents reported that IRB review had placed significant burdens on research. 64% experienced approval delays of more than3 months for protocols. 72% reported that the costs of conducting research had been increased by at least a moderate amount, and 42% reported at least a moderate, negative impact on research recruitment.IRB review increased the complexity of research, particularly when submitting to multiple IRBs in the same institution (35% of respondents). 78% of respondents had participated in multi-institu-tional studies with multiple IRBs, and 83% experienced delays due todifferences in the standards applied by each IRB. Only 6% of respondents had participated in multi-site studies with a central IRB. In spite of these difficulties, 75% felt that IRBs enhanced humansubject protection and 66% of respondents felt that IRBs strengthenedthe public trust, although many commented that the public has little understanding of IRBs and the process for reviewing human subjects research. 65% felt that neuropsychiatric studies are placed at adisadvantage in the review process, citing concerns about the capacityto consent and vulnerability of psychiatric subjects. Many comments spoke to the importance of representing the psychiatric point of viewS48 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencein the review process. Comments to improve the processs included discussing protocols with IRB members and staff before submission, establishing ongoing lines of communication with IRBs, training workshops for study coordinators (sponsored by the IRB), appearingbefore the Board to answer questions, employing trained staff tonegotiate the process, and becoming an IRB member. 62% of respondents had served on an IRB, and 16% as chairs. Lastly, the professionalism and efficiency of the commercial and NIH IRBs wererepeatedly emphasized.Discussion: While ACNP investigators identify clear burdens imposed by IRB oversight, there is also widespread appreciation of the important role that IRBs play. A more uniform process, such as thedevelopment and application of human subjects 'case law' may addresssome of the issues around inconsistency and inefficiency currently experienced. Disclosure: S.F.

Conley UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and VA North Texas Health Care System, Dallas, TX, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, Eli Lilly & Company, Indianapolis, IN Background: The NIH Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC)promises to protect the identity of research participants and is often requiredin the study of vulnerable populations. Recent court cases, how- ever, raised questions about whether the CoC can withstand legal challenge. Other potential problems include the anonymitydemanded by the CoC conflicting with some institutions requiringthe reporting of research participation in the clinical chart, the inability of the CoC to protect research data (as opposed to participant identity), the responsibility of the institution to support an investiga-tor's defense of the CoC in the face of a legal challenge, and whetherthe difficulty of obtaining a CoC is worth its presumed protections. In response to these concerns, the ACNP Human Subjects Committee convened a group to make recommendations to the ExecutiveCommittee.Methods: The subcommittee explored the pros and cons of the CoC through discussions with NIH Science Policy Advisors, CoC legal experts, and academic institutions/IRBs and an exploration of courtcases challenging the CoC protections. Results: (1) The CoC provides a unique and necessary protection for research data. (2) The courts have generally upheld the protectionsprovided by the CoC, and most attorneys and courts have beenresponsive to the CoC concept and have abided by its protections. (3) The legal ramifications of having research information on the clinical chart, with respect to the CoC, are not clear. (4) The CoC offersprotection of identifiers, not data. (5) Institutions are under legalobligation to defend the CoC against forced disclosure. Discussion: The legal challenges to the CoC will be summarized and interpreted, urban myths surrounding the CoC clarified, and potentialproblems in CoC implementation identified. In general, the CoC is relatively easy to obtain yet offers powerful protections to research participants.Disclosure: B.

Conflation of Risk Determinations for Protocols with Psychiatric Patients Barbara Stanley* Columbia University, New York, NYDetermination of research risk level is an important consideration in evaluating research protocols, not just to protect research subjectsbut also because intensity of the review and assignment of protectionsis dependent, in part, on risk level. To qualify for expedited IRB review, alteration or waiver of consent requirements, the research must be minimal risk and not involve a ''vulnerable'' population. Federal regulations call for additional protections for ''vulnerable''subjects; these include full IRB review, surrogate consent anddisallowing consent waivers. Vulnerability is analyzed within the framework of subjects' impaired decision-making capacity (e.g., cognitively disabled individuals, children) and/or a power differentialresulting in potential coercion and undue influence (e.g., students,prisoners). Psychiatric patients are not, de facto, presumed to be vulnerable. IRBs may confound risk assessment with disorder and may determine that a minimal risk study (e.g. blood draw andquestionnaire study) is greater risk simply because the studycontains psychiatric patients. While some procedures may cause psychiatric patients more distress and, thereby, impact risk, this evaluation should be on a protocol by protocol basis not simplybased on the study population. This presentation will discuss ways to clearly distinguish factors having an impact on risk determinations.Disclosure: B. Stanley, None. Inside the Black Box: What Really Happens in IRBs? Paul S. Appelbaum* Columbia University, New York, NYBackground: Institutional review boards (IRBs) are the gatekeepers that regulate access to human subjects for most neuropsychiatricresearchers. Despite frequent expressions of dissatisfaction with IRBs_often focused on the time delay, cost, and focus on minutiae that appear to characterize the process_systematic data on how IRBsoperate have not been available. Methods: This presentation reports results from an NIH-funded study of IRBs at 10 of the 25 leading academic medical centers in the U.S.(by dollars of NIH funding). Meetings of two IRB panels at eachparticipating center were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded, then subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results: The efficiency of pre-review by IRB staff members influenced the extent to which IRB members could focus onsubstantive issues rather than technicalities or wording. In general, the review process for individual studies was confined to a small subset of IRB members, with those having specific expertise regarding thearea of the study playing the greatest role. Many of the study riskscould only be identified by those with a detailed knowledge of the conditions and interventions being studied. Community members generally limited their comments to small changes in consent forms.The administrative style of the IRB chair determined the degree of interaction among members and the thoroughness of discussions. The majority of areas that the federal regulations require to be reviewedwere discussed for most protocols, but some issues appeared to havebeen systematically neglected. Protocols were almost never approved without requests for changes, however outright rejection was also rare. The special issues that arose in the review of psychiatric protocols willbe described.Discussion: For the most part, IRBs appear to be doing the job required of them by applicable regulations. However, IRB staff members play a critical but generally unrecognized role, and membersvary greatly in their contributions. Greater attention to staff organization and training, and innovative approaches to applying specific expertise to protocol review could improve both the efficiencyand effectiveness of IRB review.Disclosure: P.S. Appelbaum, Excitatory Synapses Ulrich Mueller* The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and its ErbB2/B4 receptors are encoded by candidate susceptibility genes for schizophrenia, yet the essential functions of NRG1 signaling in the CNS are still unclear. UsingCRE/LOX technology, we have inactivated ErbB2/B4-mediated NRG1signaling specifically in the CNS. In contrast to expectations, cell layers in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum develop normally in the mutant mice. Instead, loss of ErbB2/B4 impairs Increased NRG1 levels promote spine maturation. ErbB2/B4-deficient mice show increased aggression and reduced prepulse inhibition. Treatment with the antipsychotic drugclozapine reverses the behavioral and spine defects. We conclude that ErbB2/B4-mediated NRG1 signaling modulates dendritic spine matura- tion, contribute thebehavioral abnormalities in ErbB2/B4 -deficient mice. Disclosure: U. Mueller, None. Common Genetic Variation in Neuregulin 3 (NRG3) Regulates NRG3 Expression and Influences Risk for Schizophrenia Amanda J. Law* IRP, NIMH, NIH, Bethesda, MDBackground: The NRG-ErbB signaling pathway is critical to neuro- development and several genes in the network have been associatedwith schizophrenia. NRG3 is a specific ligand for ErbB4 and is the mostrecent signaling partner to be implicated in the disorder. Previous fine mapping of the 10q22-23 locus in schizophrenia has identified strong evidence of association between delusion severity and polymorphismsin intron 1 of NRG3 (Chen et al, 2009). The biological mechanismsremain unknown. We identified significant association of SNPs within intron 1 of NRG3 and increased risk for schizophrenia in 350 families with an affected offspring and confirm association to patient delusion-and positive symptom severity. Molecular cloning and cDNA sequencing in human brain revealed that NRG3 undergoes complex splicing giving rise to multiple structurally distinct isoforms. RNAexpression profiling of these isoforms in the prefrontal cortex of 400individuals revealed that NRG3 expression is developmentally regulated and pathologically increased in schizophrenia. Moreover, we demonstrate that a genome-wide significant risk SNP (rs10748842)resides within a DNA ultraconserved element and homedomain andstrongly predicts brain expression of NRG3 isoforms that contain a unique developmentally regulated 5 0exon. Methods: Family based samples were used for clinical genetic investigation of NRG3 polymorphisms. DNA was available from 350 families with an affected offspring. The samples were ascertained as part of the Clinical Brain Disorders/National Institute of Mental Health(NIMH) Sibling Study. Main effect analyses of single SNPs wereconducted using the family-based association test (FBAT). To isolate, clone and sequence full length NRG3 cDNAs, adult and fetal human brain cDNA libraries were generated. Expression levels of families ofNRG3 transcripts identified through PCR cloning were measured RT-PCR in dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) derived from 245 normal individuals, 42 fetal subjects and 113 individuals with schizophrenia. Effects of risk genetic variation onNRG3 eQTLs was examined.Results: At the clinical genetic level, distorted transmission of alleles in intron 1 of NRG3 was observed in our family-based sample. Sequencingof NRG3 cDNA transcripts in human brain shows that the gene generates 415 novel alternatively spliced variants. Disease state and rs10748842 were associated with increased brain expression of novel NRG3 isoforms that contain a unique developmentally regulated 5 0 exon (from p \u00bc1.097E/C012to p\u00bc1.445E/C015). Conclusion: Our observations strengthen the evidence that NRG3 is a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, provide quantitative insight into NRG3 transcription traits in the human brain and reveal a probablemechanistic basis for disease association.Chen, P., et al.

Analysis for Multiple Genetic Markers Associated with Antipsychotic Response Roy Twyman* Johnson & Jounson Pharmaceutical Research and Development, LLC, Titusville, NJ Background: The neuregulin ligand family interact the epidermal growthreceptor NRG-ErbB signaling cascade regulates or modulates neuronal development and migration, synaptogenesis and maintenance, gliogenesis and myelination, and neuron-neuron/neuron-glial communication. Multiple functionally distinct isoformsenhances the complexity of the diverse neuregulin neurobiology suggesting a diffuse interplay across networks and the potential for a significant role in modulating behavior. Since associations have beenfound between schizophrenia and various non-coding polymorphismsand haplotypes of the nrg1 gene, genetic variations in NRG-ErbB signaling cascade and interacting networks raises the possibility that gene-gene interactions might also play a role in drug response intreated schizophrenic patients.Methods: A pharmacogenomic analysis for multiple markers asso- ciated with response to antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenics was conducted. Discovery and validation samples obtained from controlledclinical trials of paliperidone in acute exacerbations of schizophrenic patients. Results: Genetic variation in the ErbB4 gene has been previously reported to potentially differentially affect treatment response topaliperidone. Two other genes whose allele frequency in combination with ErbB4 was present in a larger subset of subjects studied implicated an association of genetic load to variability in the treatmentresponse to paliperidone.Discussion: Since individualization by genetic profiling might max- imize benefits for patients, candidate gene and GWAS approaches may be utilized to identify combinations of genetic factors that maycontribute to variations in treatment response to antipsychotics.

Greenwood, Laura Lazzeroni, COGs Investigators University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA Objective: We created a custom 1,536-SNP chip to interrogate 94 functionally relevant candidate genes for schizophrenia and identify associations with 12 heritable neurophysiological and neurocognitiveendophenotypes collected as part of the Consortium on the Genetics ofSchizophrenia (COGS). Neuregulin and its ERBB4 receptor SNP's were selected for interrogation because of their a priori relevance in glutamate modulation in schizophrenia.Methods: A subset of 540 subjects from 130 COGS families were genotyped. The association analyses were conducted using Merlin and a novel bootstrap total significance test (TST) was developed and isS50 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencefirst presented here. It robustly demonstrates the presence of significant associations in the context of complex family data and population stratification effects, thus resolving statistical analytical concerns regarding family-wise analyses. Novel Multiple Testing Methods: Traditional multiple testing methods assess whetherindividual test results are strong enough to remain significant in the context of multiple tests, but do not provide for a formal test of whether the total number of positive findings is statistically significantand exceeds what would occur due to chance alone. Therefore, we (LL)developed a novel strategy, the bootstrap total significance test (TST), to evaluate the overall association results in a statistically rigorous manner. The bootstrap simulates results that would be seen only bychance with 16,620 tests (1,385 SNPs and 12 endophenotypes), given theunique correlation structure of families, endophenotypes, and SNPs in this study. A formal hypothesis test and overall p value is then constructed by comparing the observed results to the bootstrapsimulations. Results: Associations were observed for 46 genes of potential functional significance with 3 SNPs at p o10 /C04, 27 SNPs at 147 SNPs p o0.01. Bootstrap TST analyses confirmed that 47 SNP-endophenotype combinations with the strongest evidence of association significantly exceeded that expected by chance alone (p\u00bc0.001). Many genes interact on a molecular level, and eight displayed evidence for pleiotropy, most notably NRG1 and ERBB4. Theresults of the Merlin single-marker analyses revealed associations between the 12 endophenotypes and 46 of the 94 genes. There were 3 SNPs with a p o10/C04, 27 SNPs with a p o10/C03, and 147 SNPs with a po0.01, 23 genes significantly associated with at least one endophe- notype with p o10/C03as indicated. The most significant finding in these analyses was for a SNP in NRG1 which associated at 6.4x10/C06with a neurocognitive NRG1 and ERBB4 associatedwith 5 and 8 endophenotypes, respectively, offering a compelling picture of the importance of Neuregulin-ErbB4 signaling in the neuropathology of schizophrenia and its associated endophenotypicheritable deficits. In concert, murine NRG1 hypomorphs showdeficiencies in the PPI endophenotype. Conclusions: This confirms the importance of NRG1, ERBB4 and other glutamate related genes in the identification of genetic variationunderlying the etiology of endophenotypes in schizophrenia. Inaddition, the observation of extensive pleiotropy for NRG1 and ERBB4 and singular associations for other genes in our data suggests alternative, independent pathways involving glutamate and otherneurotransmitters (and neural 2; Allergan, Part 2; NARSAD, Part 2. Panel Session New Approaches to Old Targets Functional Selectivity at Dopamine Receptors as a Route to Novel Drugs Richard B. Mailman* Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA Background: Functional selectivity is the property of many ligands/ drugs to bind to a single receptor subtype, yet differentially affect the signaling pathways mediated by that receptor. In the extreme, a ligandmay be a full agonist at one signaling pathway, and an antagonist at another pathway, even in the same cell. Although first reported nearly 20 years ago, this mechanism has been widely accepted only recently.Its relevance to psychiatry has been shown by the demonstration thataripiprazole is a functionally selective D 2ligand, not simply a partial agonist. This demonstration of the clinical utility of functional selectivity has opened numerous scientific arenas that are the subjectof this panel (ranging from the use of computational approaches to novel in vivo models). This presentation will focus on the discovery and mechanisms of new functional selective drugs targeting the dopamine D 1and D 2receptors. Methods: These studies used a battery of D 1and D 2-related signaling assays in different cell lines. In some cases, effects on the canonical cAMP signaling pathway has been studied in both different cellular milieus and using several different assay systems. In addition, a seriesof rationally designed mutations have been made in both receptors todetermine the effects not only on ligand binding, but also functional signaling through multiple pathways. The ligands used in these studies are based on a series of rigid chemical backbones, of which the parentdrug has already been used in clinical trials.Results: 1) When a series of ligands was tested in different assay systems in which the common output was cAMP, some ligands showed striking differences in efficacy or potency across different systems. 2)Receptor mutations were found sometimes to cause profound effects on ligand binding, yet leave functional properties unchanged. Conversely, some mutations can have little effect on the signalingof one ligand, yet cause another ligand to become functionallyselective. 3) We have suggested that non-selective (bi-directed) D 1 and D 2dopamine ligands might present unique potential clinical candidates. We explored this by identifying existing compounds withstructural features suggesting dual actions, and demonstrating thatsome of these ligands were functionally selective for both D 1and D 2 receptors.Discussion: These data indicate that some compounds may look similar in pharmacological properties regardless of the milieu of the target receptor, whereas other drugs are markedly affected by cell type and assay system. This suggests that the use of a single assay systemfor functional determinations may often be problematic unless the cellenvironment chosen has been shown directly relevant to the target cell in situ . In addition, subtle changes in drug structure (or alternatively, in receptor structure) were shown to cause pronounced differences infunctional properties of a drug. This provides an opportunity toexploit new structural and computational approaches to discover new functionally selective ligands rationally. Finally, despite the advances made in understanding functional selectivity mechanisms, and indiscovering novel functionally selective drugs, there remain manychallenges in predicting which compounds should be considered as potential drug candidates.

The Ability of the D2 Dopamine Receptor to Engage the Akt/GSK3 Signaling Cascade Through a Beta-Arrestin 2-Dependent ComplexReveals Behavioral and Antipsychotic Functional Selectivity Marc G. Nikhil Urs, Bernard Masri, Ramona Rodriguiz, William C. Wetsel Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NCBackground: In the brain, dopamine (DA) is an important neuromo- dulator that mediates its actions through D1- and receptors (GPCR-7TM). Similar to other GPCRs, D2Rs haverecently been shown to signal not only through the activation of heteromeric G proteins but also through the ability of D2R/beta- arrestin 2 (Barr2) to scaffold intracellular signaling complexes.Antipsychotics display complex receptor pharmacological patternsbut all of these clinically effective agents interact with D2Rs. Whether antipsychotics might show preferential activity at D2R/Barr2 and whether the D2R-mediated Akt/GSK3 signaling might selectively affectcertain behaviors in vivo have been questions of interest. Methods: We used in vitro monitors of G protein- and Barr2- dependent D2R signaling and vivo behavioral approaches inS51 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencegenetically engineered mice to examine the ability of various antipsychotics to inhibit dopamine (DA)-associated behaviors and interfere with D2R signaling. Results: We have used cellular assays based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) approaches to monitor G protein-dependent D2R coupling to the cAMP cascade or the interaction of D2R tagged with RLuciferase and b-arrestin 2-YFP as a way to follow Barr2-dependent coupling to profile a series of antipsychotics.Whereas at D2R G protein-dependent signaling most antipsychoticsacted as inverse agonists with newer atypical agents being partial agonists, all antipsychotics uniformly and effectively antagonized the D2R/barr2 interaction with a potency 3-150-fold greater than their ability to antagonize D2R G protein-dependent signaling. Theseobservations of functional selectivity raise the possibility that blocking D2R/Barr2 interactions may be relevant to the clinical efficacy of these drugs. Moreover, in addition to the above apparent selectivity ofantipsychotics, deletion of the GSK3b gene in a cell specific manner suggests that the D2R/ barr2/Akt may show behavioral selectivity. In mice lacking GSK3b in D2R expressing neurons, the locomotorenhancing effects of amphetamine and apomorphine are markedlyattenuated whereas they are unchanged in mice lacking GSK3b in D1R expressing neurons. Conversely, the ability of mice lacking GSK3b in D2R expressing neurons to develop conditioned place preference toamphetamine was identical to wild type mice or to mice lacking GSK3bin D1R expressing neurons. Thus, these results suggest that the D2R/ Barr2/Akt signaling pathway may display functional selectivity also at the behavioral level since not all behavioral responses depend onactivation of this pathway. Lastly, we have shown that the mood stabilizer lithium can regulate Akt/GSK-3 signaling and related behaviors in mice by disrupting the D2R dependent signaling complexBarr2/Akt/PP2A presumably independent of its direct inhibitory effecton GSK3. Conclusions: The Barr2-dependent Akt/GSK-3 signaling pathway plays an important role in the behavioral actions of dopamine and mayrepresent a previous unappreciated target for selectively interferingwith the DA.

Cellular evidence suggests that hallucinogenic and non-hallucinogenic agonists may preferentially utilize certain signaling cascades, althoughthe implications of such signaling divergence have been difficult todemonstrate in vivo . Methods: The mouse head twitch response was utilized as a beha- vioral measure of 5-HT2AR activation in WT and arrestin2 knock-out mice. Biochemical assessments of receptor signaling involved western blotting of mouse cortical neuronal culture lysates and frontal cortex studies frontalcortex.Results: Serotonin a arrestin2/PI3-K/Src/AKT cascade in frontal cortex and in cortical cultures while N-methyltryptamines do not. Furthermore, disruption of this pathway in mice attenuates5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-mediated head twitch responses but notthose induced by N-methyltryptamines. inhibition ofAKT and N-methyltransferase prevents 5-HTP induced head twitches in normal mice. Discussion: This study shows that the signaling of two endo- genous neurotransmitters may differ in their ability to activate the5-HT2AR and that this difference hinges on the functional role ofarrestin2 in vivo . While arrestin2 acts as a 5-HT2AR pro-signaling molecule when serotonin is the agonist, it also serves as a negative regulator of 5-HT2AR signaling when an N-methyltryptamineis the agonist. This 4. Computational Methods to Aid Activation Pathway Specific Drug Design for G-Protein Coupled ReceptorsNaragajan Vaidehi* Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CABackground: G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are highly dynamic receptors with high plasticity to allow for versatility in their function. Extracellular ligands ranging from small molecules to large proteins activate multiple signaling pathways, depending onthe nature of the receptor, ligand, the G-proteins (including the nonG-protein dependent pathways) they couple to and the dynamic state of the cell. Modulation of cell signaling pathways by ligands of different efficacies depends intrinsically on how the chemicalstructure of the ligand modulates the potential energy surface of thereceptor. Ligands with different efficacies can remodel the energy landscape of the receptors, thereby perturbing the conforma- tional equilibrium among multiple conformational states therebyconferring functional specificity. Understanding activation dynamics and pathways is vital in designing functionally specific drugs for GPCRs.Methods: We have developed computational method called ''LITiCon'' to predict the ligand selective receptor conformational state for a class A GPCR. LITiCon method allows systematic spanning of the receptor conformations that enables more comprehensive confor-mational sampling. Starting from the crystal structure of b1 and b2-adrenergic receptor ( b2AR), we have used LITiCon computational method to predict the ligand stabilized receptor state with full (epinephrine and norepinephrine), partial (salbutamol and dopamine),and inverse agonists (carazolol) bound. We have also developedcomputational method to calculate the minimum energy pathway going from the inactive to the ligand selective state for each type of agonist.Results and Discussion: We have validated the computational methods for predicting the activation pathways of several agonists for b2AR, and shown that they are in agreement with fluorescence lifetimemeasurements. The calculated pathways for the full agonists in theb2AR start with an energy downhill step leading to a stable intermediate following by a barrier crossing leading to the active state. We find that the polarization of the amino acid residues in the binding site of the agonist by water molecules facilitates the barriercrossing. We have demonstrated the use of these methods for designing functional selective ligands. We have also further used these methods to design mutant GPCRs that show greater thermal stabilitythat should aid the expression and purification of thermal stable mutants for biophysical studies. Our computational method provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand activation mechanismsin GPCRs. The discussion will focus on the opportunities provided bythe computational methods to understand and design functional selectivity drugs. The pitfalls of the current methods and opportunities of refining the computational methods in collaboration with experi-ments will be discussed.Disclosure: N.

Coincidently this period coincides with recent data from high risk infant sib studies suggestingthat the onset of social deficits in children, who are later found to beautistic at ages 2-4 years, also occurs during this period between 6 and 12-14 months of age (Zwaigenbaum et al., 2005). Methods: Longitudinal brain MRI/DTI and behavioral measurements of infants and toddlers at risk for autism. Results: Results from a longitudinal MRI study of toddlers with autism, followed up at 4-5 years of age, provide new evidence thatcerebral cortical brain enlargement present by two years of age inautistic individuals is largely the result of increased cortical surface area occurring during this period of early development. Preliminary MRI, DTI and behavioral data from an ongoing multi-site, longitudinalneuroimaging study (IBIS Network) of infants at high risk for autism(i.e., siblings of older autistic children examined at 6, 12 and 24 months) will be presented to follow up on the above noted observations that suggest both brain overgrowth and autistic behaviorhave their onset during the latter part of the first year of life. Wehypothesize that no differences in brain morphology or behavior will be noted at 6 months of life whereas onset of early symptoms of autism as well as increased cerebral cortical brain volumes andchanges in fractional anisotropy in selected fiber tracts will be present by 12 months of age. These data will be contrasted with similar imaging data in young children with a related neurodevelopmental disorder,Fragile X Syndrome, to examine the specificity of these findings forautism. Discussion: As the development of cortical surface area and cortical thickness have distinct genetic and neurobiological underpinnings,these new findings suggest novel candidate genes and neurobiologicmechanisms (e.g., over-proliferation of peri-ventricular progenitor cells) not previously hypothesized to be of importance in autism. Focus on very early MRI/DTI brain changes as are currently beingstudied in the IBIS Network, are likely to provide important clues for early detection of later developing autistic behavior as well as insights into critical windows for early intervention.Disclosure: J.

Schultz*, Daniel Grupe, Christine Shin, Elinora Hyundi, Julie Wolf, Warren Jones Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA Background: The autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a highly heritable and heterogeneous group of disorders that share social- communicative deficits. Individuals with ASD have difficulties withsocial motivation, social perception and social cognition. Deficits inface perception, especially facial identity matching, are among the largest behavioral markers of ASD (Wolf et al., 2008), especially since these deficits have very little correlation with IQ. Hypoactivation of thefusiform gyrus (FG) during social perception tasks is perhaps the bestreplicated fMRI marker for ASD, but a few publications argue that the effects are a consequence of looking behavior during the fMRI tasks. New, unpublished data using fMRI and conventional anatomical MRIwill be presented. Results converge on abnormalities of structure andfunctional the temporal lobe of males with ASD independent of looking behavior. Methods: High resolution structural MRIs were collected on 113 males with an ASD and compared to 103 typically developing controls (TDC)males. In a second independent sample, fMRI data were collectedduring 5 separate face perception runs in 38 males, 18 with ASD and 20 TDCs. One run employed a task show requiring participants to focus on a cross hair between the eyes so as to force gaze to the eye region.All tasks utilized eye tracking measurement to characterize the impactof differential point of regard on regional brain activity. Results: Overall brain size was enlarged in ASD, with greater enlargement in the white matter vs. gray matter, especially in thetemporal lobes. White matter in anatomically defined FG was mostenlarged. Voxel based analyses show that the ventral temporal pathway in the right hemisphere is specifically enlarged in ASD vs. TDC. fMRI results also converge on this brain region. Averaging across fMRI runsthe experiment, the right amygdala and FG were significantly less active in ASD vs. TDCs. Receiver operator curves using peak signal in the right FG showed very good diagnostic sensitive and specificity.Analyses of individual runs employing face tasks that systematicallyvaried depth of processing showed evidence of task by group interactions, as well as main effects of task and group. Analyses of the eye tracking data found no evidence that hypoactivation of the FGin ASD was mediated by looking behavior - group differences weresignificant when participants looked at the eye region of the face as well as when they looked at the mouth region. Discussion: Structure and function of the FG is abnormal in ASD. Converging evidence across this other studies implicates temporal lobe regions, especially the FG in the pathobiology of ASD. Moreover, a recent genome wide association study (Wang et al, 2009) reported thefirst common variant with genome wide significance in the intergenicregion between CDH9 and CDH10. Previously published expression data in adult brain tissue show that CDH10 is most strongly expressed in the amygdala and temporal lobe, further suggesting a key role ofthese brain regions in ASD.Disclosure: R.T.

Whole Genome and Targeted Approaches to Studying Neuronal Adhesion Molecules in Autism Spectrum Disorders Matthew State* Yale University, Department of Genetics, New Haven, CTBackground: Our laboratory has had a long-standing interest in the contribution of rare genetic mutations to Autism Spectrum Disorderswhich has in the identification of three Contactin family neuronaladhesion molecules (Contactin 4, CNTN4, and Contactin Associated Protein 2, CNTNAP2) as likely contributors to both social and cognitive disability. We have now expanded our studies of rarevariation via a large-scale collaborative investigation of copy numbervariation (CNV) in 1500 ASD families with only one affected member as well as through targeted deep sequencing and functional analyses of Contactin and Contactin-associated molecules.Methods: The Simons Simplex Collection (N \u00bc6000) was studied using a combination of genotyping on the Illumina IM and IM duo platform and targeted mutation discovery via Raindance micro-emulsion PCR coupled with next generation massively parallelsequencing on the Illumina GAII instrument. CNV prediction was performed using the overlap of three algorithms, CNV confirmations were performed in both case and control groups using quantitativePCR. The sensitivity and specificity of these approaches as well as thatfor a pooling strategy for the discovery of individually rare mutations via next generation sequencing was evaluated prior to undertaking these studies.Results: Combining three algorithms for the prediction of transmitted copy number variants provides 490% positive predictive value (PPV) over a wide range of CNV ''sizes''. De novo predictions of all but theS53 Annual Conferencelargest CNVs have a PPV of o50% due to a high rate of false negatives in one parent, and must be confirmed using alternative methods such as QPCR. Pooling of 8 samples prior to library preparation using the Raindance instrument to study 1152 genomic regions simultaneouslyprovides 100% sensitivity and 499.9% specificity for the detection of a single rare mutation within the pool. New data will be presented regarding the findings of a large scale CNV study of Autism in a extremely well characterized simplex sample, with a focus on theidentification and follow-up of rare de novo CNVs implicating neuronal adhesion molecules in the etiology of ASD. The results of a large-scale mutation discovery in Contactin and Contactin associated molecules will be presented.Discussion: Autism genetics is undergoing a rapid transformation from gene hunting to gene finding, led by a combination of rapidly advancing technology and the widespread availability of large numbers of DNA samples from well-characterized individuals and families.Many of the recent discoveries have implicated individually rare sequence and structural mutations in neuronal adhesion molecules. Data from an unbiased CNV analysis and a targeted deep resequencingproject will be presented and the implications of the findings for theunderstanding of some of the biological mechanisms underlying ASD will be considered.

Patterson* California Institute of Technology, Div. of Biology, Pasadena, CABackground: Several types of maternal infection (influenza, rubella, genital and reproductive system viruses, and urinary tract bacteria) areassociated with increased risk of schizophrenia or autism in the offspring. Modeling this risk factor in mice using influenza infection or activation of the dam's immune system by injection of the doublestranded, synthetic RNA, poly(I:C) yields offspring with charac-teristic endophenotypes of these disorders. Features consistent with symptoms in autism include behavioral abnormalities (deficits in social interaction, prepulse inhibition, open field exploration, poly(I:C), saline, IL-6, or anti-IL-6 antibody (or a control antibody) plus poly(I:C) onE12.5, and the fetuses and postnatal offspring are examined at various ages. Results: The cytokine IL-6 is a key mediator of the effects of maternal immune activation (MIA) on the fetus, as shown by blocking orgenetically inactivating IL-6 in the MIA dam. Moreover, MIA acti- vates downstream IL-6 signaling pathways in the placenta and in subpopulations of neurons in the fetal brain. In addition, IL-6mRNA is induced in both of these tissues, which raises the possi-bility of a feed-forward mechanism that could lead to permanent changes in immune status as is seen in the brain and peripheral immune system of autistic subjects. There is also evidence forinflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in autism. Thus, it is of interest that we find that MIA leads to significant changes in lymphocytes from the spleen and the GI-associated, mesenteric lymphnode of adult offspring. CD4 + T cells display elevated levels of thepro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17 in response to stimulation in vitro . Discussion: These observations support the hypothesis that MIA can cause permanent changes in immune status of the offspring. Thus, theMIA model has face and construct validity for autism, and is proving useful for exploring the mechanism of how the maternal infection risk factor alters fetal brain and immune system development. Work byothers has further shown that the MIA model is useful in evaluatingpotential therapeutic approaches. Disclosure: P.H.

This study used a longitudinal approach to examine sensitivity to the effects of D 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (D9-THC) in a rodent model during adolescence [postnatal day (PN) 28-42] and into adulthood, with comparisons to effects in ratsthat began an identical dosing regimen as adults. Evaluation of sensitivity was achieved through use of a battery of tests in which cannabinoids produce the characteristic effects of hypothermia,catalepsy and suppression of spontaneous activity.Methods: Male and female Long-Evans rats were periodically assessed in the test battery over the course of chronic dosing with vehicle or D 9-THC. In order to obtain an entire dose-effect curve in each rat, a cumulative dosing procedure was used for assessment at each time point. Prior to the start of the chronic dosing regimen, an initial assessment in the test battery was completed on PN30 for adolescent rats or during early adulthood ( 4PN65). Rats were then administered vehicle or 10 mg/kg D9-THC twice daily for 30 days, with additional assessments in the test battery occurring on days 7, 14, and 31. Injections were terminated after day 31 and a 7-day wash-out period began. Rats were re-tested on day 38.In addition, a group of rats of each age and sex were chronically dosedwith vehicle until day 38 when they w ere injected with cumulative doses ofD 9-THC and tested. Studies were approved by the IACUC at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA and were conducted inaccordance with the NIH G u i d ef o rt h eC a r ea n dU s eo fL a b o r a t o r yA n i m a l s . Results: In all groups of rats, D9-THC produced significant dose- dependent suppression of spontaneous activity, hypothermia and catalepsy. D9-THC-induced effects in this initial pre-treatment test were similar across doses in rats of the same age and sex, regardless of the assigned chronic treatment condition; however, significant differences between effects in adolescent and adult rats were apparent for somemeasures. For example, adolescents of both sexes exhibited greatersensitivity to D 9-THC-induced suppression of activity; however, adult males and females were more sensitive to D9-THC effects in the bar test of catalepsy. Increased sensitivity to hypothermic effects was alsofound in adolescent (vs. adult) males, but not in female adolescents(vs. adults). Final cumulative dose-effect curves, conducted when adolescents had reached adulthood, revealed dose-dependent decreases in spontaneous activity regardless of age, sex, or treatment condition.Hypothermia occurred only in adolescent and adult rats of both sexes that received D 9-THC acutely or intermittently during testing over the course of the chronic dosing regimen. However, in both sexes, dose-dependent increases in catalepsy were observed in adolescent and adultrats in all treatment conditions, with adults attending the bar significantly longer than adolescents. Discussion: In summary, sensitivity to the acute effects of D 9-THC differed across age and sex. Further, administration of D9-THC during development altered this level of sensitivity, regardless of whether exposure was chronic or intermittent. Nevertheless, age and sex differences in sensitivity to D9-THC's effects in the bar test persisted, suggesting that age and sex differences in D9-THC's effects are task- specific.

Wiley: None.S54 ACNP 49th Annual Exposure on Rat Cognitive Performance Loren Parsons* The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CABackground: Heavy cannabis use by humans is associated with neurocognitive deficits including impairments of attention, inhibitorycontrol, impulsive behavior, decision-making and memory. Neuroi-maging studies have demonstrated cannabis-induced alterations in the function of the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus and components of the basal ganglia and it has been proposed that neural dysfunction inthese areas contribute to a loss of inhibitory control that propelscontinued cannabis use. The purpose of this study was to characterize neurocognitive function in rats given long-term intermittent exposure toD9-THC doses that produce clinically relevant plasma D9-THC levels. Methods: D9-THC Dosing: Male Wistar rats were treated with vehicle, 0.3 or 3.0 mg/kg D9-THC (i.p.) in repeating cycles of 14-day blocks in which D9-THC was administered 2x per day for 6 days, followed by an 8-day drug-free period during for behavioral testing. Behavioral Testing: Separate cohorts of rats were prepared for testing in fivebehavioral tasks. (1) 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5-CSRTT;n\u00bc20/group); (2) Delay Discount (n \u00bc7/group); (3) Differential Reinforcement of Low Rates of Responding (DRL-30; n \u00bc7/group); (4) Novel Object Exploration, conducted in three stages to evaluate latency to exploration, recognition memory using substitution andrecognition memory using displacement (n \u00bc8/group). (5) withdrawal; 3 mg/kg SR141716A). dependence was evaluated with tests 7-day intervalsfollowing cessation of D9-THC treatment. (n \u00bc8/group). Results: All tests were conducted over the course of at least 10 cycles of D9-THC treatment. 5-CSRTT: Significant D9-THC effects were evident in ''challenge'' tests employing variable inter-trial interval (ITI) timesto increase task difficulty: a dose dependent decrease in accuracy atshort ITIs and increased impulsive responding at long ITIs. Delay Discount: There was no significant effect of D9-THC on performance of this task. DRL-30: Enhanced performance (rewards/total responses) was evident in the 3 mg/kg group from 4 cycles of D9-THC treatment forward. Object Exploration: D9-THC treated animals displayed increased exploration latency (index of anxiety-like behavior) anddecreased novel object recognition in substitution tests (index ofrecognition memory). Precipitated Withdrawal: SR14716A induced significant withdrawal signs in all measures, with the severity directly related to the D9-THC treatment dose. Significant antagonist-induced withdrawal persisted for up to 2 weeks following D9-THC treatment. Discussion: Despite evidence of dependence, increased anxiety-like behavior and deficits in recognition memory, D9-THC treated rats displayed no alterations in attention, impulsive behavior or inhibitorycontrol when tested under well-established, familiar conditions.However, 5-CSRTT trials with increased task difficulty revealed significantly increased impulsive behavior and decreased accuracy that correlated with the D9-THC treatment dose. These findings suggest that long-term D9-THC exposure results in diminished behavioral performance under conditions of increased cognitive load. Supported by NIDA P20 DA024194.Disclosure: L.

Huestis* National Institute on Drug Abuse, Baltimore, MDBackground: Neurocognitive impairment has been observed after chronic daily cannabis smoking as compared to na \u00a8ve cannabis users, abstinent former heavy cannabis smokers and current occasional cannabis smokers. Pope et al found that chronic daily cannabis smokers (greater than 5000 lifetime uses) were impaired at baselineand after seven days of sustained abstinence, but there were no significant differences in performance at 28 days of abstinence 1.I n contrast, Bolla et al. reported significant cognitive impairment at baseline that continued through 28 days of abstinence in a differentcohort of heavy cannabis smokers2. We suggest that the mechanism of the observed cognitive impairment could be residual D9-tetrahydro- cannabinol (THC) in the brain due to a high body burden of cannabinoids that occurs following extended daily cannabis smoking.THC is the primary psychoactive component in cannabis. THCconcentrations in blood and plasma decrease rapidly after acute, occasional cannabis smoking 1, but what is the best approach for investigating chronic cannabis exposure?Methods: For safety and ethical reasons, we would never dose cannabis smokers with the amount of cannabis and the length of time they self- administer the drug. We evaluated cannabinoid pharmacokinetics in whole blood, plasma and urine in chronic daily cannabis smokersfollowing initiation of cannabis abstinence and residence on a closed research unit for up to 30 days. All urine voids throughout the study were analyzed by two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectro-metry with low limits of quantification of 0.25 ng/mL in whole blood,plasma and urine in order to quantify residual excretion of cannabinoids. Results: We found THC 1 ng/mL in whole blood and plasma of some chronic daily cannabis smokers for up to 7 days and THC, not theinactive 11-nor-9-carboxy- D9-tetrahydrocannabinol, in urine of chronic smokers up to 24 days after the start of abstinence. Furthermore, females had significantly longer detection of THC inblood, plasma and urine than males, despite similar amounts of cannabis smoked per day and years of cannabis smoking; however, detection time was not significantly correlated to body mass index.Discussion: These data suggest that residual THC in brain could be the mechanism of neurocognitive impairment in chronic cannabis smokers, and that with sustained cannabis abstinence, performance may return to baseline levels. Our current research further probes thishypothesis by evaluating CB1 cannabinoid receptor density duringcannabis dependence and sustained cannabis abstinence. 1Huestis MA, Henningfield JE and Cone EJ.

Mason*, Rebecca Crean, Vivian Goodell The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA Background: Cannabis withdrawal is not included in the DSM-IV because its ''clinical significance is uncertain.'' However rats chronically treated with cannabinoids, but not drug na \u00a8ve rats, showed marked withdrawal when administered the CB1 antagonist rimona-bant. We aim to characterize precipitated (rimonabant) versus naturally-occurring (placebo) cannabis withdrawal across emotional, behavioral, and biochemical measures in paid volunteers withcannabis dependence and in relation to untreated non marijuana-using controls, to provide clear evidence of a cannabis withdrawal syndrome. Methods: Subjects are male and female cannabis dependent volunteers and non marijuana-using controls, ages 21 to 30 years. This is a 28-daylongitudinal study with two components: a single dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of precipitated in theS55 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencelab using rimonabant 90 mg po, followed by outpatient assessments of key symptoms of cannabis withdrawal with financial compensation for monitored abstinence over the subsequent 28-day period. Results: Cannabis subjects averaged 45 years of daily use of 41 gram of marijuana per day and had a baseline urinary THCCOOH/creatinineconcentration of 4400 ng/mL. Rimonabant-treated subjects showed significant elevations in plasma cortisol and ACTH and on the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist and Spielberger State-Trait AnxietyInventory relative to placebo following dosing on the challenge day,but then averaged lower scores on these scales, as well as on the Beck Depression Inventory, over the subsequent period of monitored abstinence. However untreated, non marijuana-using controls scoredlower than cannabis groups on all scales at all time points. TheTHCCOOH/creatinine concentrations confirmed marijuana abstinence over the 28-day study. Discussion: Rimonabant 90 mg precipitated a significant acute increase in cannabis withdrawal symptoms which then significantly decreased over the 28-day study, relative to placebo. Both cannabis groups showed elevated mood, anxiety, and cannabis withdrawalsymptoms relative to non marijuana-using controls.

Panel Session Comparing Neural and Behavioral Characteristics in Schizophrenia and Psychotic Bipolar Disorder: Findings from the Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network on ParsingIntermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) Study Neurocognitive Abnormalities in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Probands and Their Family Members John Sweeney*, James Reilly, Scot Hill, Brett A. Clementz University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, University of Georgia, Athens, GA Background: Neurocognitive abnormalities are well established in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives. Parallelingmultiple lines of evidence that now indicate phenotypic and genotypic overlap between schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP), recent studies have documented prominent and persistent cognitive impair-ments in bipolar patients as well. Large scale studies investigating therelative prevalence and profile of these deficits in BP have not been conducted, nor has the expression of these deficits in unaffected relatives of BP patients been extensively investigated.Method: In the BSNIP study, neuropsychological tests, cognitive neuroscience paradigms and cognitive oculomotor tasks were used to evaluate neurocognitive function in what now is a sample of 1200subjects relatively equally divided among 5 groups: SZ and BPprobands, unaffected relatives of these two groups, and healthy controls. Results: Neuropsychological deficits on the BACS test were at 1.7 SD for Sz patients and 1.2 SD for BP probands. Deficits in Sz were greaterthan in BP in all BACS domains but verbal memory. Spatial span was notably affected in Sz relatives, while verbal memory impairment was more notable in BP relatives. Stop signal task performance was theonly test where deficits were greater for BP than Sz probands. CPT,emotion identification and spatial span deficits were similar in Sz and BP probands; among these, only CPT deficits were greater in Sz thanBP relatives. On an auditory oddball task, BP relative and healthy subjects had highly similar brain responses, while SZ and BP probands and SZ relatives showed abnormal P2 and P3 responses to target stimuli. Antisaccade deficits were greater in Sz than BP probands butwere similar in the family member groups.Discussion: Cognitive deficits are pronounced in BP patients. These were less pronounced than in Sz probands for several domains with the notable exception of the stop signal task. Deficits were present inunaffected Sz and BP family members, with these deficits being greaterin Sz relatives on some but not all tests. The profile of deficits across BP and Sz suggests that different domains of function are relatively more affected in the two disorders. These observations clarify severalsimilarities and differences across Sz and BP in neurocognitivefunction, and suggest that cognitive data may provide useful intermediate phenotypes for family genetic studies into the boundary of these disorders.Disclosure: John Sweeney, Pfizer, Part 1; Janssen Research grant, Part 2. Functional Network Connectivity Analysis of Resting State fMRI Data in Schizophrenia and Psychotic Bipolar Probands and Their Unaffected RelativesGodfrey Pearlson* Yale University/Institute of Living, Hartford, CTBackground: Functional network connectivity (FNC), measuring connections among brain circuits, (as opposed to between regions)can be used to characterize fMRI neural interactions during cognition or at rest. Methods: We used FNC to examine differential interactions between independent resting state networks in 116 healthy controls, 63 bipolarpsychotic (BP) and 51 schizophrenia (SZ) patients, 74 relatives of SZ & 27 relatives of BP, (age/sex/ethnicity matched) derived from the BSNIP study and imaged at 3T during a 5-minite scan during which subjectswere instructed to lie still and focus on an asterisk. Resting state circuitswere identified using Independent Component Analysis in the GIFT toolbox, which delineated 15 components, including the default mode network. FNC was implemented using the method of Jafri et al 2008.Results: Both patient groups and both groups of unaffected relatives differed from healthy controls. Many of the abnormal functional network connections (both increased and decreased vs controls) were unique between patient groups (p o0.05 FDR corrected). However, 3 precuneus; affected in both analyses andprimarily appeared to be more tightly connected in relatives andprobands compared to controls. In general, relatives displayed fewer differences from controls than probands, but they also displayed differences from controls not seen in their affected relatives.Discussion: This large scale study suggests that specific anomalous functional connections are shared between SZ and BP probands. Also, unaffected relatives of SZ and BP subjects shared several connectivity abnormalities with their affected probands, but additionally differ-ences that may represent compensatory mechanisms. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of FNC to identify both potential resting connectivity based ''endophenotypic'' and ''disease'' markers for mooddisorders and psychosis.Disclosure: G.D.

Preliminary Structural MRI Data from the B-SNIP Study Matcheri Keshavan* Harvard University, Boston, MABackground: Schizophrenia (SZ) and psychotic bipolar disorder (BP) overlap in clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and etiology,S56 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceraising questions about the that these are distinct diseases. Characterizing disease-related neurobiological alterations in these disorders is likely to have key implications to efforts addressing this question. The Bipolar and SchizophreniaNetwork for parsing Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) consortiumseeks to examine a broad panel of endophenotypes (cognitive, electrophysiological, and imaging) in 500 SZ and 500 BP probands and their relatives (SZrel and BPrel). The B-SNIP project is currentlyongoing in recruitment; we herein present findings from interimmorphometric analyses of the structural MRI (sMRI) images. Methods: MRI scan were obtained using 3.T magnets and analyzed using Freesurfer. Regions known in prior literature to be altered in SZand BP were examined across groups using ANCOVAs with age, sex,intracranial volume and study site as covariates; significant tests were followed by pair-wise comparisons. A total 381 patients (SZ, n \u00bc87; BP, SZrel n controls, \u00bc96) were processed. Results: Both schizophrenia and bipolar probands show structural deficits compared to controls in orbitofrontal, heteromodal association cortices, medial temporal and and cingulate regions, with schizo-phrenia probands in general having more severe and widespreaddeficits compared to bipolar probands. Subcortical regions are larger in schizophrenia probands compared to both controls and bipolar probands. Structural measures in relatives of schizophrenia andbipolar probands showed deficits in these brain regions intermediatein severity between patient and control groups. However, the left medial orbitofrontal, superior frontal and pars orbital volumes were larger in bipolar relatives compared to controls.Discussion: Our sMRI data support the view that there may be commonalities as well as unique distinctions in brain structural changes between schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorders.Further analyses are under way to investigate the heritability of thesemeasures as well as relationships between sMRI alterations and other endophenotypic measures in psychopathological, cognitive, functional and physiological domains.Disclosure: Pearlson, James Gold, Elliot Hong Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, Baltimore, MD Background: Search for vulnerability genes of schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) has been complicated by their complex nature with high phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Furthermore, theirboundaries are poorly demarcated resulting in substantial overlap ingenetics and pathophysiology. The Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network on Parsing Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) study is examining endophenotypes to disentangle this etiologic and pathophysiologicoverlap between the two. Endophenotype is defined as a specific,heritable, quantifiable brain deficit that marks psychosis risk. Research of the past three-four decades has identified several such endopheno- types. Studies suggest that many of these endophenotypes markindependent aspects of psychosis risk, however a large sample study that includes a comprehensive battery in the two disorders has not been carried out. Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent uniquegenes are associated with each of the endophenotypes.Methods: Relationships across different endophenotypes were exam- ined using Principal Component Analysis with varimax rotation in a sample of 156 subjects (schizophrenia probands, their relatives, andhealthy control subjects). A total of 12 measures (P50 sensory gating,PPI, SPEM, antisaccade, oculomotor delayed response, and composite measures of memory, problem solving, processing speed, working memory, and attention) were included. Genetic associations wereexamined in a SZ sample (N \u00bc451) and a large cohort (n \u00bc971) that included both SZ and BD families (B-SNIP sample). Genetic studies either examined associations with candidate genes, or carried out atwo-phase study that included a genome-wide screen in 100 subjects, followed by confirmation of top hits in a larger sample that used False Discovery Rate corrections. The latter set of studies used the predictive component of the smooth pursuit eye movement function as aphenotype.Results: Cognitive measures, errors in antisaccade, and oculomotor delayed response task loaded on to the same factor. While, P50 sensory gating, PPI, smooth pursuit eye movement measures loaded on tothree separate factors. Variation in NRG1 was associated with PPI inthe first sample, while variation in a non-synonymous coding SNP in CHRNA5, rs16969968, was associated with sensory gating. Neuroxin 3 (NRXN3) was one of top genes screened by the genome wide screeningin the discovery sample. The association was confirmed in African-American subjects in the confirmatory analysis. Variation in ALDH5a1 was associated with early motion processing and smooth pursuit response. ALDH5a1 gene codes for semialdehyde dehydrogenaseenzyme, a GABA degradation enzyme. The phenotype associated with the deficiency in this enzyme is well described and include problems in early visual processing. In secondary study showed significant effectsof variations in ALDH5a1 on visual evoked potential. Predictive pursuitresponse was significantly worse in SZ and their relatives compared with healthy control in the B-SNIP sample. BD probands and relatives performed at a intermediate level. We are in the process of genotypingNRXN3 and ALDH5a1 genes in this sample in attempt to replicate thefindings. Discussion: These findings show that cognitive measures, P50 sensory gating, PPI, and SPEM are independent suggesting that they markindependent aspects of psychosis risk. Variations in different genes are associated with different endophenotypes. Disclosure: G.K. Thaker, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Part 4. Drugs of Abuse and Postpartum Depression Postpartum Depression: An Overview Zachary Stowe* Emory University, Atlanta, GABackground: Maternal mental illness following childbirth has been described for centuries. These illnesses have been broadly grouped asthe 'blues', postpartum depression (PPD), and postpartum psychosis (PPS). The debate about whether or not PPD and PPS represent a distinct set of illnesses has eased over the past decade with theincreasing recognition that many of these women have a previoushistory of mood or anxiety disorders prior to childbirth. The postpartum period represents a unique neuroendocrine and psycho- social event that, fortunately, the majority of mothers traverse withoutsignificant mental illnesses.Methods: Literature review and presentation of scientific data derived from the Emory Women's Mental Health Program and collaborators.Results: There remain issues with respect to the optimal identification/ detection of PPD utilizing rating scales. Despite the long term recognition, there remain sparse data on etiology, vulnerability factors,and treatment response that have incorporated assessment of'recurrent' versus 'new onset' illness events. It seems intuitive, that sex steroids and/or their metabolism/interactions could account for the vulnerability to develop PPD. However, the extant data awaitsreplication. Recent data from our group and others have demonstratedthat the 5-HTTLPR genotype is associated with depressive symptoms in women with a history of depression. Preliminary data suggested that response to antidepressants may be differ between 'recurrent' versus'new onset' of depression in the postpartum period. The treatment ofPPD is often complicated by a desire to breast feed. Remarkably, as a class, antidepressants now have more data in breast feeding than anyS57 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceother class of medications. While adverse effects from medication exposure during breast feeding are limited, maternal tobacco and substance abuse have not been included in these reports. Across the vast majority of these epidemiological, etiological, treatment, andfollow up studies - maternal tobacco and substance abuse is typicallyviewed as a consequence of maternal depression. Conclusion: The role(s) of co-morbid substance abuse in the etiology, treatment response, and impact on infant development of maternaldepression as well as its contribution to 'recurrent' versus 'new onset'episodes, if included, have typically relied on maternal self-report and therefore may be under-estimated.

Association Between Drugs of Abuse and Postpartum Depression Amy L. Salisbury* Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, Providence, RIBackground: Current drug use by pregnant women in the United States is estimated at 5.2% for illicit drugs, 16.4% for nicotine and 11.6%for alcohol. 1Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) occurs in over 11% of women at child-bearing age1;and has been reported to occur in 10-25% of women during pregnancy. Although the prevalence of co-morbidMDD and substance use during pregnancy is often reported to be quitehigh, the rate is not clear. Moreover, the specific nature and timing of associations between substance use and MDD has not been previously described.Methods: Data analyses (Chi-square) were performed on the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health database 2to determine co- morbidity statistics on pregnant women, depression, and substance use. Specific questions examined included: What is the prevalence ofco-morbid substance abuse/dependence and depression in the pastyear for pregnant women? Do the associations vary by trimester? Do the associations vary by drug type? Results: In the survey data, 978 respondents were pregnant. As reported in the NASDUH publication, 5.2% of the women reported current drug use. Further data analyses by trimester of pregnancy did not reveal differences based on trimester(X 2\u00bc1.776, p \u00bc.624). There was also no difference between trimester on alcohol depen-dence (X2\u00bc4.47, p \u00bc.215), however there was a trend for fewer women to report alcohol abuse in the third trimester (1.5%) than in the first (5.4%) or second trimester (4.19%; X2\u00bc8.86, p \u00bc.312). In this sample, 7.67% reported a significant episode of MDD in the past year,with no difference between trimesters. pregnancy. All substances of abuse showed an association with prenatal and/or postpartum depression; the associations were often stronger when nicotine oralcohol was combined with other substances. There was a signi- ficant lack of data on the timing and onset of depression in relation to substance use during pregnancy. More than three timesthe number of women who reported MDD also reported illicitsubstance dependence in all trimesters of pregnancy (2.80% vs. 10.67%). Discussion: The majority of published studies suggest that prenatal substance use is highly associated with incidence of major depressionin pregnant and postpartum women. The data analyzed here suggest the same trend. However, timing of depression onset versus drug use onset was not able to be assessed. Specific associations by drug typeand other psychotropic medications will be discussed. These data willalso be discussed in relation to data from database samples and large national cohort studies. 1. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (2008).

Animal Models Depression: Effects of Steroid Hormones Liisa A.M. Galea* University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, CanadaBackground: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects 15% of women and very few women with PPD seek treatment. Women with untreatedPPD have impaired cognitive ability, marital difficulties, and are morelikely to abuse their children. Children of untreated PPD mothers have an increased risk to develop depression and have impaired cognitive, motor and social development. Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampusis associated with depression, is modulated by drugs of abuse andsteroid hormones and may be a neural marker for depression. In the present experiments we examined the effects of animal models of postpartum depression on adult hippocampal neurogenesis andsucrose anhedonia. Further we tested stress reactivity and impulsivity in the offspring of PPD dams to understand effects of PPD on the offspring. Steroid hormones play a significant role in depression. Duringpregnancy and postpartum, levels of estrogens, progesterone andglucocorticoids fluctuate dramatically and may contribute to the etiology of PPD. We have created two animal models of PPD based on steroid hormones. In the ovarian hormone withdrawal model with-drawal from a hormone simulated pregnancy increases depressive-likebehavior. In our corticosterone (CORT)-induced model, high chronic levels of CORT during the postpartum increased depressive-like behavior in the dams and increased anxiety-like behavior in theoffspring.Methods: In this study, a hormonally-simulated pregnancy was induced in ovariectomized female rats and the effect of a 'postpartum' drop in estradiol was examined on hippocampal cell proliferation andsucrose preference, a model of anhedonia Further we examined the effects of high corticosterone (40 mg/kg) given during gestation and/or the postpartum on hippocampal cell proliferation and sucrosepreference. In Expt 1, 4 days after a hormone stimulated pregnancyrats were perfused to assess cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus. A separate group of rats was tested for consumption of, and preference for, sucrose at baseline, throughout the hormone simulated pregnancyand during the withdrawal. In Expt 2 female rats were given highCORT during gestation and/or the postpartum period for 10-21 days and the dams and offspring were examined for changes in hippocampal cell proliferation and in a variety of behavioural tests,including impulsivity. Results: In Expt 1 hormone withdrawal decreased hippocampal cell proliferation which was rescued by commitment treatment with thetricyclic antidepressant, imipramine. Imipramine significantly in-creased hippocampal cell proliferation in intact females, but not in ovariectomized females suggesting that imipramine's effects on hippocampal cell proliferation in female rats is related to ovarianhormones. Further withdrawal from a hormone simulated pregnancyreduced sucrose preference. In Expt 2 high CORT during gestation resulted in increased depressive-like behavior and stress reactivity while high CORT during postpartum resulted in altered impulsivity inthe offspring. High CORT during the gestation and the postpartumreduced cell proliferation but did high CORT during the postpartum did not alter sucrose preference in the dams. Conclusions: Together these studies suggest an important role for steroid hormones on the dams and her offspring in these models of postpartum depression and may link impaired behavior in the offspring to maternal hormone environment.Disclosure: L.A.

Due to thewell documented increase in drug and alcohol abuse associated with depression, we hypothesized that mice exhibiting depression- like behaviors in the postpartum period would exhibit increaseddrug and/or alcohol abuse. Given the well known actions ofalcohol on GABA Areceptors (GABA ARs), we sought to determine whether deficits in GABAergic inhibition may underlie the increased alcohol consumption associated with postpartum depression-likebehaviors. Methods: We utilized the two-bottle test to monitor voluntary consumption of either normal drinking water or 6% ethanol. Todetermine the influence of postpartum depression-like behavior onalcohol abuse, voluntary alcohol consumption was measured in virgin and postpartum wild type or Gabrd /C0//C0mice. To determine the impact of stress on alcohol abuse, voluntary alcohol consumption was monitoredin vehicle and Antalarmin treated wild type or Gabrd/C0//C0mice. Results: In a two-bottle test, mice exhibiting depression-like behaviors in the postpartum period demonstrated increased voluntary con- sumption of 6% ethanol compared to postpartum wild typemice. However, the mechanism underlying this increased alcohol consumption is unknown. In humans, major depression is associated with hyperexcitability of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)axis. Interestingly, we observe an exacerbated stress responseinGabrd /C0//C0mice and changes in the activation of the HPA axis, evident by an increased basal firing rate of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of thehypothalamus, which we hypothesized may play a role in theseabnormal postpartum behaviors as well as the increased alcohol consumption. Abnormal postpartum behaviors can be mimicked in wild type mice with either physiological stress or adminis-tration of exogenous stress hormones. Due to the evidence of increased alcohol abuse associated with both depression and stress, we hypothesized that activation of the HPA axis may play a rolein alcohol abuse. To test this hypothesis, we blocked HPA axisactivation with a CRH antagonist, Antalarmin, and monitored alcohol consumption. Mice treated with Antalarmin exhibited a decrease in voluntary alcohol consumption compared to vehicletreated mice.Discussion: Our data suggest that mice exhibiting postpartum depression-like behaviors exhibit a propensity for alcohol consump- tion in the postpartum period compared to pre-pregnancy and controlpostpartum mice. The increased alcohol consumption is associatedwith hyperactivity of the HPA axis in Gabrd /C0//C0mice and is diminished by inhibiting the HPA axis with Antalarmin. This study demonstrates a correlation in postpartum depression-like behaviors and alcoholconsumption in a novel mouse model and implicates the body's stress response in voluntary alcohol consumption associated with post- partum depression-like behaviors.Disclosure: J.

Elmer, Hui-Qiu Wu University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MDBackground: The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism accounts for over 95% of dietary tryptophan degradation co- agonist site of the NMDA receptor. Several lines of evidence indicate that the functions of these two receptors, which are intimately involvedin synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes, are modulated byfluctuations induces deficits in contextual learningand memory in experimental animals. These effects model aspects ofcognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia and are therefore especially interesting in view of the fact that schizophrenia patients present with increased KYNA levels in brain and cerebrospinal fluid.Conversely, cognitive processes may be enhanced by reductions in brain KYNA levels. We tested this concept in mice with a targeted deletion of kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), a majorbiosynthetic enzyme the mammalian brain.Methods: Young (21-32 day-old) wild-type and KAT II knock-out mice, both on a FVB/N background, were used in all studies. Microdialysis was performed in the hippocampus of unanesthetized mice. Tissue andextracellular KYNA and glutamate levels were measured by HPLC withfluorimetric detection. Object exploration and recognition, contextual memory (passive avoidance) and spatial discrimination (T-maze) were tested according to conventional methods (described in detail byPotter et al., Neuropsychopharmacology 2010 Mar 24 - Epub ahead of print). Long-term potentiation was induced in CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices using a pairing protocol consisting of 3 brief highfrequency tetani (50 pulses at 100 Hz, 4 s intervals), applied at the endof a 3 min depolarization at 0 mV. Results: At 21 days of age, KAT II knock-out mice had reduced hippocampal KYNA levels (-71%) and showed significantly increasedperformance in three cognitive paradigms that rely in part on theintegrity of hippocampal function, namely object exploration and recognition, passive avoidance and spatial discrimination. Moreover, compared to wild-type controls, hippocampal slices from KAT II-deficient mice showed a significant increase in the amplitude of long-term potentiation in vitro . These functional changes were accompanied by reduced extracellular KYNA (-66%) and increased vivo . Discussion: Taken together, a picture emerges where a reduction in the astrocytic formation of KYNA increases glutamatergic tone in thehippocampus and enhances cognitive abilities and synaptic plasticity.These studies raise the prospect that interventions aimed specifically at reducing KYNA formation in the brain may constitute a promising molecular strategy for cognitive improvement in health and disease.Acknowledgment: This work was supported by USPHS grant Metabolites Robert Dantzer*, Keith W. Kelley, O'Connor University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, ILBackground: The concept of inflammation-associated depression initially developed in the context of psychiatric side effects of cytokineimmunotherapy in patients with viral infections or chemotherapy andradiotherapy-resistant malignancies. It has now developed well beyond this early iatrogenic context and applies to the increased prevalence of depression that is observed in patients with chronic inflammatorydisorders, to age-related depressive symptoms and even to treatment-resistant depression. The mechanisms of inflammation-associated depression represent potential targets for the development of new antidepressants. Clinically, reduced circulating tryptophan and in-creased kynurenine levels are correlated with increased depression scores of patients undergoing cytokine immunotherapy, and the same alterations in the metabolism of tryptophan are observed in patientswith various chronic inflammatory disorders. These biochemicalalterations point to a possible role of activation of the tryptophan degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) in the inflammation-associated depression.Methods: To study the mechanisms of inflammation-associated depression, we have developed murine models of depressive-like behavior induced by acute or chronic activation of the peripheral innate immune system. In the first case, mice respond to intraper-itoneal administration of lipopolysccharide by an episode of sickness which resolves in a few hours. This short duration permits an investigation of depressive-like behavior independently of sickness,based on increased duration of immobility in the forced swim and tailsuspension test, and decreased consumption of sucrose in a two-bottle preference test. In the second case, mice are inoculated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin . The subsequent sickness episode resolves within a few days and is followed by depressive-like behavior that can beevidenced for several weeks after inoculation. Results: We have confirmed that inflammation-induced depression is associated with activation of peripheral and central IDO, which is thefirst and rate-limiting enzyme of the kynurenine metabolic production by administration of minocycline abrogates the increased expression of proinflammatorycytokines and the subsequent activation of IDO, resulting in inhibition ofboth inflammation-induced sickness and depressive-like behavior. Inhibition of IDO activation by pharmacological means (administration of 1-methyl tryptophan) or the use of IDO knock-out mice depression without altering expressionof proinflammatory cytokines and inflammation-induced behavior. In addition, administration of kynurenine restores depres- sive-like behavior in IDO-knockout mice previously administeredlipopolysaccharide, which indicates that immune activation is inducingdepression via the formation of neuroactive kynurenine metabolites. Discussion: Because of the compartmentalization of kynurenine metabolism in the brain, the next step for this research is thedetermination of the cellular compartment in which degradation of kynurenine ultimately leads to development of depression.

Peripheral Activation of the Kynurenine Pathway by Interferon- Alpha Leads to Altered CSF Concentrations of Kynurenine and Its Metabolites Which Correlate with Depression Andrew H. Miller* Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GABackground: Converging evidence suggests that activation of the innate immune, inflammatory response including the release ofcytokines of the innate immune system may contribute to the pathogenesis of major depression in certain depressed patients. One pathway that may be relatively unique to the mechanisms by which inflammatory stimuli contribute to the symptoms of depression iscytokine-induced activation of the enzyme, acid (QUIN) and kynurenic acid (KA). QUIN and KA are both neuroactive and may contribute tothe behavioral changes experienced by patients during chronicexposure to inflammatory stimuli such as the innate immune cytokine, interferon (IFN)-alpha. Of note, activation of IDO appears to play a critical role in the development of depressive-like symptoms inlaboratory animals following exposure to inflammatory stimuli such aslipopolysaccharide and bacille Calmette-Gue \u00b4rin, an attenuated form of Mycobacterium bovis. A relationship between depressive symptoms and peripheral blood TRP, KYN and KA during IFN-alpha treatment inhumans has been described. However, whether peripheral blood changes in these IDO catabolites are manifest in the brain and whether they are related to central nervous system cytokine responses and/orbehavior is unknown.Methods: TRP, KYN, QUIN and KA were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood along with CSF concentrations of relevant cytokines, chemokines and soluble cytokine receptors in 27 patientswith hepatitis C after B12 weeks of either treatment with IFN-alpha (n\u00bc16) or no treatment (n \u00bc11). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Results: IFN-alpha significantly increased peripheral blood KYN, which was accompanied by marked increases in CSF KYN (IFN-alpha- treated: 111.5 nM SD 19.2, t \u00bc2.36, p\u00bc0.03). Increased CSF KYN was in turn associated with significant increases in CSF QUIN and KA (Spearman's rho \u00bc0.72, decreases in peripheral blood TRP, IFN-alpha had no effect on CSF TRP concentrations. Increases in CSF KYN and QUINwere correlated with increased CSF and monocyte chemoattrac- protein as well as depressive \u00bc0.47, \u00bc0.019 and Spearman's rho \u00bc 0.39, p\u00bc0.043, respectively). Discussion: These data demonstrate that peripheral administration of a cytokine of the innate immune system can activate IDO in concert with central nervous system cytokine responses, resulting in increasedbrain KYN, QUIN, KA, and ultimately depressive symptoms.

Guillemin*, A. Rahman, K. Ting, Kathryn Cullen, N. Braidy, R. S. Chung, W. Wu, B. J. Brew University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, Kuwait University, Kuwait City, Kuwait, St. Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research, Sydney, Australia, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia,University of New South Wales, Syndney, Australia, University ofTasmania, Hobart, Australia Background: Some of the tryptophan catabolites produced through the kynurenine pathway (KP), and more particularly the excito- toxin quinolinic acid (QA), are likely to play a role in the patho-genesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shownthat the KP is over activated in AD brain and that QA accumulates in amyloid plaques and within dystrophic neurons. We hypo- thesized that QA in pathophysiological concentrations tauphosphorylation.Methods Using immunohistochemistry, we found that QA (HPT) within corticalS60 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceneurons in AD brain. We then investigated in vitro the effects of QA at various pathophysiological concentrations on tau phosphorylation in primary cultures of human neurons. Using western blot, we found that QA treatment increased the phosphorylation of tau at serine 199/202,threonine 231 and serine 396/404 in a dose dependent manner.Increased accumulation of phosphorylated tau was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry. This increase in tau phosphorylation was paralleled by a substantial decrease in the total protein phosphataseactivity. A substantial decrease in PP2A expression and modestdecrease in PP1 expression were observed in neuronal cultures treated with QA. These data clearly demonstrate that QA can induce tau phosphorylation at residues present in the PHF in the AD brain. Toinduce tau phosphorylation, QA appears to act through NMDAreceptor activation similar to other agonists, glutamate and NMDA. The effect PCR arrays, we found that QA significantly induces10 genes in human neurons all known to be associated with AD pathology. Of these 10 genes, 6 belong to pathways involved in tau phosphorylation and 4 of them in neuroprotection. In 3xTg-AD mice(n\u00bc6), we have detected an accumulation of kynurenine QA in a progressive and age-dependent manner. QUIN production is predominantly restricted to the hippocampal regions. Conclusion: Altogether these results indicate a likely role of QA in the AD pathology through promotion of tau phosphorylation.Understanding the mechanism of the neurotoxic effects of QA is essential in developing novel therapeutic strategies for AD.

Panel Session New Perspectives on the Brain Regulation of SocialPerception and Behavior OPRM1 Variation, Reward Sensitivity and Social Behavior - Transla- tion Across Species and Situation Christina S. Barr* NIH/NIAAA/LNG-Section of Comparative Behavioral Genomics, Bethesda, MD Background: Mu-Opioid receptor gene polymorphisms that influence receptor affinity for b-Endorphin have arisen independently in humans and rhesus macaques and have been shown to moderate responses to alcohol in the respective species. We have previously demonstrated there to be effects of OPRM1 C77G genotype on the development of infant attachment. Genetic variation that influencesendogenous opioid response could also potentially impact the incentive-motivational aspects of other types of social interactions. We, therefore, wanted to investigate whether OPRM1 genotype would influence social interactions during adolescence in rhesusmacaques. Because alcohol-induced stimulation is higher as a function of this allele, we also examined whether it predicted individual differences in aggressive responses to provocation during periods ofintoxication. Methods: Behavioral responses to an unfamiliar intruder male were recorded in adolescent/young adult male rhesus macaques over30 minutes in an Intruder Challenge Test. In a separate study, a 2.2g/kg dose of alcohol (IV) was administered, and aggressive responses to a human intruder were measured over 5 minutes. Behavioral response factors were generated using factor analysis. Animals weregenotyped for the OPRM1 C77G polymorphism, and whether genotype predicted behavioral factor scores was assessed by ANOVA. The effects of the OPRM1 G allele on individual behavioral responses to the presence of an intruder across time (10, 20, 30 min) were also assessedusing repeated measures ANOVA.Results: Factor analysis generated 4 factors relating to social interaction for the Intruder Challenge Test (Agonistic, Clingy,Curious/Bold, Threatening) and 3 aggression factors for the IV- Alcohol Aggression Test (Threatening, Distance Decreasing, Esca- lated). The OPRM1 G allele predicted the Curious/Bold factor (positive loadings for locomotion and approach intruder, Po0.01) for the Intruder Challenge Test and the Escalated Aggression factor (positiveloadings for open-mouth threat and lunge, Po0.0005) for the IV Alcohol Test. Repeated measures ANOVA of the behaviors loading onto the Curious/Bold factor demonstrated effects of genotype on thefrequency with which the focal approached the intruder. G allelecarriers approached the intruder more frequently ( F(1,25) \u00bc14, p\u00bc0.001 ), especially during the first 10 (genotype x phase interaction, F(2,50) \u00bc4, p\u00bc0.02) . that males carrying the OPRM1 77G allele, which predicts increased alcohol response and intake, are more rapid in their approach of an unfamiliar conspecific, a trait that could be adaptive in certain environmental contexts. We also show that thisvariant predicts aggressive responding to threat under conditions of intoxication. Our findings suggest that variation at the OPRM1 locus may be associated with differences in sociality and alcohol-relatedviolence in humans. The relevance to these findings to data recentlyobtained in human subjects will be also discussed. This research was carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted and promulgated by the NationalInstitutes of Health.Disclosure: C.S. Barr, None. Why Rejection Hurts: New Evidence for Shared Mechanisms Underlying Physical and Social Pain Naomi I. Eisenberger* University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CANumerous languages characterize 'social pain,' the feelings resulting from social rejection or loss, with words typically reserved fordescribing physical pain (''broken hearts,'' ''hurt feelings'') andperhaps for good reason. It has been suggested that, in mammalian species, the social attachment system borrowed the computations of the physical pain system in order to prevent the potentially harmfulconsequences of social separation. In this talk, I will use a combinationof behavioral and neuroimaging methodologies to explore the notion that physical and social pain rely on overlapping neural and experiential processes. Specifically, I will examine: 1) whether socialpain activates pain-related neural circuitry, 2) whether individual differences in sensitivity to one kind of pain relate to individual differences in sensitivity to the other (e.g. Do individual differences ina pain-related mu opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) relate to individualdifferences in sensitivity to social pain?), and 3) whether factors that up- or down-regulate one type of pain affect the other in a similar manner (e.g., Can Tylenol reduce social pain?).Disclosure: N.I.

Jennifer Bartz*, Eric Hollander, Jamil Zaki, Niall Bolger, Daphne Simeon, Kevin Ochsner Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY Background: Oxytocin (OXT) regulates social behavior, attachment and social memory in animals. While recent studies suggest OXT may have similar functions in humans, the role OXT plays in human socialperception and behavior is neither simple nor obvious, e.g. OXT was shown to increase negative social emotions like envy. Rather than broadly facilitating positive social emotions, these data suggest OXTmay increase the salience of social cues, thereby triggering the positiveor negative emotions associated with those cues. We tested this alternative account of OXT function in humans. Study 1 tested the effects of OXT on trust and cooperation in healthy adults and adultsS61 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencewith borderline personality disorder (BPD), a disorder marked by interpersonal insecurity. Study 2 tested the effects of OXT on memories of maternal closeness and care in childhood. The popular view suggests OXT should facilitate trust and cooperation, andpositively bias maternal memories in everyone. However, if OXTenhances the salience of social cues, baseline psychological set, and especially chronic beliefs about the reliability of close others (attachment anxiety), should moderate OXT's effects, with secureindividuals benefitting from OXT but not more insecure, anxiousindividuals. This idea is consistent with broader interstionist views that individual differences uniquely shape our response to situations. Methods: Study 1 used a randomized, between subject design in which 14 BPD and 13 healthy adults received intranasal OXT (Syntocinon,Novartis) or placebo (PL); trust and cooperative behavior were assessed while subjects played a social dilemma game. Study 2 used a randomized, mixed between-within subject design in which 31healthy men received intranasal OXT/PL on two occasions; memories of maternal closeness and care in childhood were assessed with the Inclusion of Other in Self Scale (IOS) and Parental Bonding Instrument(PBI). In both studies, individual differences in attachment weremeasured at baseline with the Experience in Close Relationships Scale. Results: Study 1 results showed a significant group x drug interaction for trust, F \u00bc4.83, po.05, and for response to partner hypothetical cooperation, F \u00bc5.06, po.05. OXT decreased trust and cooperative responses for BPD but not control subjects. Analyses focusing on individual differences in attachment across subjects showed that these effects were driven by the anxiously attached subjects. Study 2 resultsshowed that, again, differences in attachment anxiety moderated OXT response. Specifically, attachment anxiety predicted change (OXT-PL) on the IOS, b \u00bc-.45, t \u00bc-2.95, po.01, and PBI, b \u00bc-.12, t \u00bc-2.16, po.05, such that securely attached individuals remembered being closer to their mother and remembered their mother as more caring following OXT (vs. PL) whereas anxiously attached subjects remem- bered being less close to their mother and remembered their mother asless caring following OXT (vs. PL).Discussion: We found the effects of OXT on interpersonal perception and function were moderated by baseline psychological set, i.e. individual differences in attachment anxiety. These data argue againstthe popular notion that OXT has broad positive effects on socialperception and function in humans and suggest a more nuanced role of OXT function, e.g. increasing the perceived salience of social cues. Although popularly dubbed ''hormone of love'' these data suggest anarrower answer to the question of who will benefit from OXT. Disclosure: J.A. Bartz, None. The Neural Substrate of Alexithymia in Borderline Personality Disorder Antonia S. New*, Marianne Goodman, David Carpenter, Cheuk Tang, Erin A. Hazlett, Larry J. Siever James J Peters VAMC/MIRECC, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, James J Peters VAMC, Bronx, NY, Mount Sinai School ofMedicine, New York, NY, James J Peters VAMC/MIRECC, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Bronx, NY Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a common, serious and chronic psychiatric illness. Recently, investigators havecome to view the abnormalities in social functioning as a core deficit inBPD. We have previously shown evidence of alexithymia from behavioral responses, psychophysiology and fMRI BOLD response to emotional pictures in adult BPD patient and controls. In the presentstudy, we present white matter abnormalities using DTI tractographyin adolescent BPD and their relationship to symptoms of BPD. Methods: We conducted DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) tractography on 14 adolescent in patients with BPD and 13 age- and sex-matchedcontrols. Subjects for BPD-revised (DIB-R) criteria for BPD. Controls had no current axis I or II diagnosis as assessed by the SCID-P and SCID-II,although BPD adolescents met criteria for major depressive disorder, as is characteristic of inpatients with BPD. DTI was acquired on a 3T Siemens Allegra and processed with both in-house software and FSL for pre-processing and DTI-tractography. A study-specific-templatewas created using the FSL-TBSS package and used to outline DTI-tractography (Carpenter et al 2008). Fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated from the DTI-tractography of the following tracts: genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, inferior bilateral longitudinalfasciculus, and bilateral cingulum bundle (Figure 1).Results: A tract specific decrease in FA was found in the ILF of BPD patients (left ILF t \u00bc3.13 po0.005; right ILF t \u00bc2.92 po0.008; p \u00bcns for other tracts). In addition to the bilateral decrease in FA in the ILFin BPD adolescents compared to controls, we also found significantinverse correlations between clinical measures of BPD symptoms of social dysfunction (Borderline Features Scale-Child) and FA in right ILF (BPD: r Correlations of FA in the ILF were not significant for measures of depression. Conclusion: While the function of the ILF is poorly understood, individuals with brain lesions specifically in left ILF show poor abilityto name objects (Mandonnet et al 2007) and in right ILF with difficulty in recognition of facial affect (Philippi et al 2009). This is very interesting because a profound deficit in the ability to name anddescribe feelings has been found in BPD. Moreover, we have shownhigh levels of alexithymia in adult BPD. Our finding of low FA in the ILF, supporting the notion of disruption in white matter efficient signal conduction, in the brain area related to object naming andemotion recognition provides a very interesting possible neural substrate for this difficulty in naming and describing affect in BPD. Future studies will need to examine whether this abnormality persistsinto adulthood, is predictive of BPD in at risk adolescents and relatesto symptoms of social dysfunction in BPD.

Panel Session Novel Treatment Targets from Preclinical Models ofNeurodevelopmental Disorders Behavioral Assays in Genetic Mouse Models to Discover Treatments for Autism Jacqueline Crawley* National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MDIntroduction: Autism is a major mental illness with a strong genetic component. As candidate genes linked to autism are identified, micewith targeted mutations of these genes are becoming available. Geneticmouse models offer useful translational tools to test hypotheses about genetic and environmental causes of autism, and to discover effective treatments for the diagnostic and associated symptoms of autismspectrum disorders.Methods: The key to translational applications is robust, highly replicable functional assays. Our laboratory has been developing novel mouse behavioral paradigms with high face validity to the threediagnostic symptoms of autism. This presentation will focus onbehavioral tests for mice that are proving useful in treatment discovery. The core deficit in reciprocal social interactions is beingS62 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencemodeled longitudinally across developmental stages with juvenile and adult reciprocal social interactions, and in our automated 3-chambered social approach task. Communication in mice is being approached with measures of the emission, detection, and responses to socialolfactory cues and auditory ultrasonic vocalizations. The thirddiagnostic category of motor stereotypies, repetitive behaviors, insistence on sameness, and narrow restricted interests is being analyzed in mice by quantitating stereotyped motor behaviors,repetitive self-grooming, perseveration during the reversal phase ofT-maze and Morris water maze spatial tasks, and restricted exploration of complex environments. Comprehensive control parameters are scored to detect physical deficits that will result in artifacts whichconfound the interpretation of specific autism-relevant phenotypes.Drug treatments are administered before the behavioral test, using dose-response methods standard in behavioral neuropsychopharma- cology. Behavioral interventions are administered at specific timepoints during early development. Results: Examples will be presented of treatments in the BTBR T + tf/J (BTBR) inbred strain mouse model of autism, which displays lowsociability and high repetitive behaviors. The control group is thestandard inbred strain C57BL/6J (B6) which displays high sociability and low repetitive behaviors. The prototypic mGluR5 antagonist MPEP reduced repetitive self-grooming effects inthe standard C57BL/6J inbred strain (B6), and no effect on generalopen field exploratory locomotion. Acute treatment with risperidone, the antipsychotic approved for treating ''irritability'' associated with autism, reduced repetitive self-grooming in BTBR only at doses thatwere sedating in the open field. Early behavioral intervention with B6 juvenile peers rescued the social deficits in adult BTBR. Discussion: We have developed an experimental design that will be useful for evaluating a range of treatments for the diagnosticsymptoms of autism. Early success with an mGluR5 antagonist in ameliorating repetitive self-grooming in BTBR provides a proof of principle for the translational value of mouse models of autism.Disclosure: J.N.

Pathogenesis and Treatment of Fragile X Syndrome Mark Bear* MIT, Cambridge, MABackground: Fragile X syndrome is caused by transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene encoding the fragile X mental retardationprotein (FMRP). One consequence of the loss of FMRP in the Fmr1 knockout mouse model is excessive basal hippocampal protein synthesis. Excessive protein synthesis has been shown to alterin synaptic plasticity triggered by activation of metabotropicglutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). The mGluR theory of fragile X posits that diverse symptoms of the disease are caused by hypers- ensitivity to mGluR5 activation. We have investigated how mGluR5regulates protein synthesis and whether manipulations of thispathway can correct the excess in fragile X. In addition, we have investigated the Tsc2 + /- mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), another disease with a high prevalence of autism whichhas been hypothesized to have pathophysiology that overlaps with fragile X. Methods: Hippocampal slices were prepared from WT and mutant mice, and assays of protein synthesis and mGluR5-dependent synapticplasticity were performed. Treatments that corrected these phenotypes in vitro were tested on behavioral phenotypes in vivo . Results: We find that the excess protein synthesis in fragile X is completely corrected by treatment with an mGluR5 negative allostericmodulator (NAM). Stimulation of slices with an mGluR5 agonist reliably activates the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway in all genotypes. Interestingly, an inhibitor of ERK could also correct excessive proteinsynthesis in the Fmr1 KO, but an inhibitor of mTOR could not.Consistent with this finding, we do not observe a phenocopy of fragile X in the Tsc2 + /- mice in which mTOR signaling is enhanced.Treatment of fragile X mice with an inhibitor of ERK completely suppressed audiogenic seizures, similar to what has been observed previously with mGluR5 NAMs. Discussion: We conclude that excessive protein synthesis in fragile X is downstream of glutamate-mGluR5-ERK signaling, suggesting addi-tional therapeutic targets. Our data are not consistent with the hypothesis of excessive mTOR activation as a basis for altered protein synthesis or mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity in fragile X.Disclosure: M.

Lowe, Jo Nagawa, Mustafa Sahin, Vicky Whittemore UCLA, Los Angeles, CABackground: An emerging theme in the biology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is the involvement of signaling mechanisms thatregulate protein synthesis, such as those involving mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. For example, heterozygous mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, key regulators of mTOR signaling, causetuberous sclerosis and elevate the risk for autism 50-fold compared tothe general population. Prenatal viral infections also constitute a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and ASDs, and they may also modulate mTOR signaling.Methods: To test for an interaction between the Tsc2 heterozygous mutation in mice and gestational Poly I:C (a model of gestational immune activation), we performed timed matings between Tsc2 heterozygotes males in the C57BL/6Ncrl genetic background andC57BL/6J wild-type (WT) females and injected pregnant females at E12.5 with either Poly I:C (20 mg/kg) or saline control. To test if seasonal influenza infections interact with TSC gene mutations in thepathogenesis of TSC-related ASD, we obtained birth date and clinicalinformation from human TSC populations (clinical samples from 4 sources in the US and the UK) and estimated gestational age during peak seasonal flu activity for TSC-ASD individuals and, as a referencegroup, for TSC individuals without major neuropediatric phenotypes.Results: We will report interactive effects of these two autism risk factors Tsc2 heterozygous mutation and gestational immune activation) in a mouse model for TSC: a Tsc2 heterozygous mutation combined withgestational immune activation, but not each these factors individually, had adverse effects on intrauterine survival and adult social approach behavior, a model of social problems in autism. Moreover, our studies inhuman TSC populations are also consistent with an interaction betweenprenatal viral infections in late gestation and TSC mutations in the generation of ASDs phenotypes in these populations. Discussion: Taken together, the results described above show that a heterozygous Tsc2 mutation and the Poly I:C model of gestational viralinfections display interactive effects on intrauterine survival and social behavior in adult mice. Studies in human TSC populations indicated an association between high seasonal flu activity in late gestation andautism. Collectively, our data raise the possibility that TSC gene mutations interact with gestational viral infections in the pathogenesis of TSC-related autism.Disclosure: A. Silva: Part 4; Roche. Rescue of the Cognitive Defects in the Adult Angelman Syndrome Mouse Model Edwin Weeber* University of South Florida, Tampa, FLBackground: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurological disorder characterized by severe developmental delay, cognitive disruption,S63 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencepropensity for seizure with an associated characteristic electroence- phalogram, sleep disturbances and an ataxic gait. AS is estimated to occur in 1 of every 15,000-20,000 births and is caused by various disruption of the maternal UBE3A allele. UBE3A encodes foran E3 throughout neurons of the CNS.The mouse model for AS was developed through the null mutation of exon 2 of the UBE3A gene and mice inheriting the maternal copy of the mutated UBE3A show all of the major phenotypes established inthe human condition. Biochemical investigation revealed a changein the phosphorylation state of Calcium Calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII) at the autonomously active 286 autoinhibitory 305/306 site to prevent phosphorylation was sufficientto rescue the major AS phenotypes when bred with the maternal deficient UBE3A mouse model. The genetic rescue of the overt AS phenotype suggested that therapeutic intervention could be possible.Methods: Two separate strategies were used to test the hypothesis that the cognitive disruption in the AS mouse model was reversible in the adult. AS mice were aged to 16-18 weeks and bilaterally injected: 1)intrahippocampally with sero-type-9 adeno-associated viral (AAV-9)particles containing the ventricles withB280 nM Reelin protein. Reelin is a naturally occurring extracellular matrix protein in the CNS shown to modulate synapticfunction in the hippocampus, enhance LTP, modulate ligand-gatedreceptors and increase spine density in vivo . Five weeks post injection mice were tested for associative and spatial learning and memory using contextual fear conditioning and hidden platform water mazerespectively. Behavioral controls included measurements of activity, anxiety, motor coordination and pain perception. Results: AAV-9 mice showed UBE3A expression throughout the hippocampal formation with greater expression in the dentategranule cell layer. Neither experimental group showed significant differences in any of the subsequent control behavioral tests and experimental and treatment groups revealed the characteristic motorcoordination defect. However, both AAV-9 and Reelin injected ASmice showed significant increases in freezing behavior 24 hours and 1 week following fear conditioned training. The increase in freezing was comparable to that of wild type mice. All groups performedcomparable during hidden platform training. A probe test was givenon day 7 following 6 days of spaced training. Both Reelin and AAV-9 injected mice showed significant increases in target platform crossings and both revealed improved search strategies.Disscussion: The present studies suggest that the major measurable cognitive disruption in the AS mouse model can be rescued in the adult. The strategies of a future human therapeutic acting as acognitive enhancer, gene therapy for UBE3A, or a biochemically-induced increase in paternal expression from the silenced paternal allele may be efficacious treatments for the severe cognitive disruption seen in human AS patients.Disclosure: E.

The Impact of Stress andGlucocorticoids on Glutamate Transmission and Brain Function Dual Regulation of Glutamatergic Transmission and Working Memory by Stress in Prefrontal CortexZhen Yan* State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NYBackground: The prefrontal cortex (PFC), a key brain region controlling cognition and emotion, is strongly influenced by stress. Through the action of corticosteroid stress hormones, acute stress has been shown to enhance learning and memory, while chronic stressoften produces detrimental effects on these measures. In this study, we have identified the molecular and cellular mechanisms that may underlie the complex actions of stress in PFC. Methods: A combination of electrophysiological, biochemical, im- munocytochemical and behavioral approaches has been used toexamine the impact of stress in vivo and in vitro in male rats at the prepubescent or early adolescent period. Cellular knockdown and pharmacological methods have been used to identify key moleculesinvolved.Results: Acute behavioral stressor or short-term corticosterone treatment in a long-lasting potentiation of NMDAR- and AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents and a marked increase ofNMDAR and AMPAR surface expression in PFC neurons. These effectsof acute stress are mediated by glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), and require the induction of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK) and the activation of Rab4, which controls receptor recyclingbetween early endosomes and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, behavioral tests indicate that working memory, a key function relying on the recurrent excitation within networks of PFC neurons, isenhanced by acute stress via a GR-dependent mechanism. InhibitingSGK, which blocks stress-induced enhancement of glutamatergic transmission, also blocks stress-induced facilitation of working memory, suggesting that the GR/SGK-induced glutamate receptormembrane trafficking in PFC may underlie the working memoryimprovement by acute stress. In contrast to the enhancing effect of acute stress on glutamatergic transmission, in vivo chronic stress or in vitro long-term corticosterone treatment induces a long-lasting depression of NMDAR and AMPAR synaptic responses. Moreover, in chronically stressed animals, the expression of NR1 and GluR1 subunits is selectively decreased, which is accompanied by their increasedubiquitination. These effects of chronic stress are blocked byproteasome inhibitors that reduce the degradation of ubiquitin- conjugated proteins. Furthermore, behavioral tests indicate that the object recognition memory is impaired by chronic stress.Discussion: Corticosterone, the major stress hormone, serves as a key controller for neuronal responses that underlie behavioral adaptation, as well as maladaptive changes that lead to cognitive and emotional disturbances in stress-related menta ld i s o r d e r s .H e r ew ed e m o n s t r a t et h a t acute or chronic stress induces a significant potentiation or depression ofglutamatergic transmission in PFC, r espectively, which is likely caused by the altered levels of NMDAR and AMPAR subunits. These results have identified a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-termdepression (LTD) of synaptic transmission induced by natural stimuli in vivo , providing a potential mechanism f or the beneficial effects of acute stress and detrimental effects of chr onic stress on cognitive processes subserved by PFC. In addition to providing a basis for the biphasic effectsof stress and glucocorticoids on synaptic plasticity and memory, key molecules revealed by this study should also provide valuable targets for designing novel therapies that modify the neuronal stress response.Disclosure: Z.

Mechanisms of Stress-Induced Release of Glutamate and the Dampening Action of Antidepressant Agents Maurizio Popoli* University of Milan, Milano, Italy Background: Behavioral stress is a main risk factor for neuro- psychiatric diseases. Acute stress induces rapid changes in the release of neurotransmitters, hormones and cytokines that may become damaging if the stress response is inadequate or excessive.Inappropriate stress response acts as a trigger, producing a vulnerable phenotype in genetically predisposed individuals and increasing the risk for mental ilness. Converging evidence has suggested that acutestress is associated with increase of excitatory transmission in certainforebrain areas. In this work we investigated the mechanism whereby acute stress increases glutamate (GLU) release, and if psychiatric drugs prevent the effect of stress on GLU release.S64 ACNP 49th Annual ConferenceMethods: Rats were chronically (2 wks.) treated with vehicle or different drugs employed for therapy of mood/anxiety disorders (fluoxetine, desipramine, venlafaxine, (FS)-stress (40-min FS;0.8 mA, 20 min total of actual shock with random intershock lengthbetween 2-8 sec). The action of stress on GLU release and synaptic transmission were analyzed by complementary methodologies, includ- ing superfusion of freshly prepared synaptosomes (SPT), patch-clamprecordings of acute slices, molecular analysis of presynaptic machin-ery, electron microscopy (EM) ultrastructural analysis of synapses and confocal microscopy (CM). Results: Acute stress induced marked increase in (15 mM K +) depolarization-evoked release of GLU from SPT of prefrontal/frontalcortex (P/FC) in superfusion, and the chronic drug treatments mostly or completely prevented the GLU release increase [1]. Stress rapidly increased circulating levels of corticosterone (CORT) in both vehicle-and drug-treated rats, and GLU release increase was blocked by previous administration of selective antagonist of glucocorticoid receptor (GR; RU 486). Experiments with protein synthesis inhibitorsshowed that this is a non-genomic effect of CORT. On the molecularlevel, stress induced accumulation of presynaptic SNARE complexes in synaptic membranes (both in vehicle- and drug-treated rats), and changes in synaptic signaling regulating SNARE complex. Patch-clamprecordings of pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex layer III revealedthat stress increases GLU transmission through both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, altering both N and P quantal parameters. Antidepressants normalize release by reducing release probability, butdo not normalize postsynaptic changes. Superfusion of SPT with sucrose or ionomycin, as well as EM and CM confirmed that the readily releasable pool of vesicles was increased by stress.Discussion: Acute FS stress rapidlly up-regulates GLU release in P/FC (both in isolated SPT and whole tissue), by rising CORT level, stimulation of GR by CORT and rapid accumulation of presynaptic SNARE complexes. Chronic treatment with different antidepressantsprevents Glu release up-regulation, by a mechanism downstream ofSNARE complex assembly. This novel effect of antidepressants on the response to stress, shown here for the first time, is likely related to the antidepressant/anxiolytic action of these drugs.[1] Musazzi et al. (2010) Acute stress increases depolarization-evokedglutamate release and presynaptic SNARE complex accumulation in prefrontal/frontal cortex. Disclosure: M. Popoli, Part 4. The Effects of Stress on Glutamate Uptake and Metabolism Gerard Sanacora*, Mounira Banasr, Golam glial dysfunction and abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission in the neuropathology of stress-related illnesses including major depressive disorder. Postmor- tem studies have repeatedly found a decreased density and number ofglial cells in cortical regions, including the prefrontal and cingulate areas from depressed patients. However, it is unclear whether these changes are related to the pathophysiology of the disorders. Thefollowing studies sought to determine the relationship between stress,glial mediated glutamate transporter activity and behavior. Methods: The rodent chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model was used to examine the effects of stress on glial cell function andglutamate metabolism employing carbon magnetic resonance spectro-scopy and molecular biology methods. The behavioral effects of specific pharmacologic agents with actions on glutamate transporter activity were examined to explore the relationship between glutamateuptake, stress and antidepressant-like activity. Lastly, heterozygousGLT1 (EAAT2) knockout mice, expressing markedly reduced levels of the primary glial glutamate transporter, were examined in severalbehavioral models to explore the role of the transporter in mediating stress responsivity. Results: We demonstrated that chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), a rodent model of depression, resulted in a reduced level of glialfibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression and glutamate/glutaminecycling glial function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as behavioral changes on measures of sucrose preference, active avoidance and forced swim. Drugs such as riluzole and ceftriaxonethat have effects on GLT1 expression and function were demonstratedto prevent the effects of CUS on glial metabolism, glutamate cycling, and behavior. We further demonstrated that reduced function of the GLT1 transporter can modify stress related behavioral effects in thePFC. Using both heterozygous GLT1 knockout mice and a selective GLT1 inhibitor, into the PFC we are able to demonstrate that decreased glutamate transporter function leads to an increased sensitivity to stress, and a decreasedantidepressant-like efficacy for riluzole and ceftriaxone. Discussion: These data suggest that glial mediated glutamate uptake in the PFC may contribute to the behavioral and physiological responseto stress. These studies support the hypothesis that glial dysfunctionobserved in the cortex tissue samples from patients with major depressive disorder may not only be a consequence of the illness but also be a susceptibility factor for depression. Together, these resultssuggest modulation of glial mediated glutamate clearance may be aviable target for future antidepressant drug development. Disclosure: G.

Circadian Disruption as a Stressor: Effects on Prefrontal Cortex and Relevance to Cognitive and Mental Health Ilia Karatsoreos*, Sarah M. Bhagat, Erik Bloss, John H. Morrison,Bruce McEwen The Rockefeller University, New York, NYBackground: The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in control of mood, impulsivity, decision-making and cognitive flexibility.Importantly, it is clearly affected by both acute and chronic stress. Chronic stress results in increase d anxiety, learned helplessness and impaired cognitive flexibility, wit h the medial PFC showing shrinkage and loss of synaptic connections. Current paradigms show that stress can alter glutamatergic signaling within the PFC, suggesting putative mechanisms by which the effects of stress can al ter cognition and emotionality. Disruption of circadian (daily) rhythms is pervasive in modernindustrialized society, with our endogenous circadian clock being out of synch with environmental light-dark cycles. This i s especially obvious in certain occupations, many of which h ave high cognitive demands, such as aircrews and medical residents. Disruption of sleep and circadianrhythms is also a hallmark of numer ous psychiatric syndromes, and the role that such disruption plays in the exacerbation, or etiology, of such d i s o r d e r si ss t i l ln o tk n o w n .N e wd a t a from our lab indicate that chronic circadian disruption causes rem odeling of circuitry in medial PFC (mPFC) and reduced cognitive flexibil ity and dysregulation of metabolic endocrine function. This pattern o f results suggests that circadian disruption may serve as a chronic stre ssor that could perturb the normal functioning of the mPFC, and lead t o behavioral abnormalities. Methods: C57Bl6 mice were housed in a 20hr light dark cycle, in opposition to the endogenous, approximately 24hr period of thecircadian clock. Mice were weighed weekly throughout the course ofthe experiment, and body temperature recorded throughout. After 8-10wks of circadian disruption (CD), mice were tested in the open field task (OFT), the light-dark emergence task (LDE), and a modifiedversion of the Morris water maze task (MWM) that tested cognitiveflexibility. At the end of the study period, blood was collected from the animals and assayed for the important metabolic hormones leptin andS65 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceinsulin. In a separate group of animals, brains were removed and cells of layer II/III of the prelimbic PFC (PL) were filled with Lucifer yellow, reconstructed using computer assisted morphometry, and analyzed. Results: CD animals had reduced apical dendritic length and decreased dendritic complexity in the PL. Basal dendrites were unaffected,paralleling changes observed in chronic stress. Using the MWM, we found impaired ability to shift learning to a new quadrant, although acquisition of the initial platform location was normal, indicative of areduction in cognitive flexibility. In the OFT, CD animals entered thecenter of the field more rapidly than controls, and were faster to emerge into the light in the LDE. CD mice also showed increased body weight and elevated levels of plasma insulin and leptin.Discussion: Our data provide a novel model of circadian disruption induced changes in PFC morphology and mediated behaviors, with ecological and clinical relevance in the context of the disrupted sleep cycles experienced by many individuals in modern society. Wepropose that this model will provide an excellent jumping off point to further understand how environmental stressors can alter the structure and function of the PFC, and provide insight into potentialtherapeutic targets to reduce the effects of stress on the brain.Disclosure: I.N. Karatsoreos, Sepracor Inc., Part 4. Panel Session Alzheimer's Disease: Beyond the Amyloid Hypothesis Viewing the Pathogenic Roles of Alzheimer's-Related Genes Through a Different Lens Ralph A. Nixon* NYU Langone Medical Center/Nathan Kline Institute, New York, NYBackground: Links between genes causing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and processes promoting A boverproduction or aggregation are persuasive, though still indirect, support for an A btoxicity model of AD pathogenesis. Guiding most AD drug development, the amyloid- b cascade hypothesis has yielded effective amyloid-lowering strategies but so far with less-than-hoped-for therapeutic efficacy. Theseconsiderations and other emerging data suggest that pathogenicfactors besides A bmay be essential for AD development and may need to be considered in designing effective therapies. Although amyloid and neurofibrillary pathologies have been the principal sources forclues to AD pathogenesis, the origin of hallmark ''neuritic dystrophy'' characteristic of affected neurons in AD, is providing further mechanistic insights. The grossly swollen dystrophic neurites in ADbrain are filled mainly with autophagic and lysosomal compartmentscontaining incompletely degraded substrates, including A b. This massive ''storage'' of waste proteins in neurons, reminiscent of lysosomal storage diseases, reflects a marked impairment of autophagy- the major lysosomal mechanism for protein clearance. Thispathology is part of a continuum of lysosomal system functional deficits in AD, which begin to develop before amyloid is deposited. The deficits are also linked to actions of the genes driving AD, whichincreasingly have been recognized to modulate autophagy and endocytosis, the main pathways of the lysosomal system. I will discuss how the same AD genetics that implicate A bin AD also implicate primary lysosomal system dysfunction as a mechanism that both cripples neuronal functions critical for synaptic plasticity and neuron survival and promotes accumulation of toxic proteins, including A b and tau.Methods and Results: Our studies (Lee et al. Cell, in press ) show that the AD-related gene presenilin1 (PS1) is essential for lysosomal proteolysis and autophagy and plays a novel role in lysosome acidification required for protease activation. In cells lacking PS1,including neurons in mice conditionally depleted of PS1, a failure todeliver the proton pump vATPase to lysosomes and autolysosomes containingwaste proteins. PS1 mutations causing familial AD (FAD) confer partial loss of these same functions in fibroblasts from PS-FAD patients and in neurons of PS1/APP mutant mice. Lysosomal dysfunction also develops in sporadic AD and in AD mouse models driven in part byother AD-related genes. Supporting the pathogenic significance of thisdysfunction, we find that partially restoring deficient autophagy in the CRND8 mouse model of AD by genetically manipulating lysosomal protease activities substantially memory deficits.Discussion: Autophagy is essential for neuron survival and loss of PS1 support for autophagy explains the accelerated neuritic dystrophy and neuronal loss seen in PS1-FAD. Because A bgenerated during autophagy is normally degraded in lysosomes, impaired lysosomalAbclearance may also accelerate amyloidogenesis. Emerging evidence also links genes causing inherited forms of other neurodegenerative disease to the lysosomal system, reinforcing the concept that primarylysosomal system dysfunction is a pathway to neurodegeneration in AD and possibly other aging-related neurological disorders.

Pimplikar* Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland OHBackground: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, afflicts about 5.3 million Americans. The cause of AD is notconclusively known and there is no cure for or effective treatment against the disease. Two membrane proteins, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin, play a major role in AD pathology. Aprevailing hypothesis of AD pathogenesis posits that increased accumulation of amyloid- b(Ab) peptide, produced when presenilin cleaves APP, is the primary cause of the disease. Although this premisehas received significant support, it is becoming increasingly clear thatnon-A bfactors also play a significant role in disease causation. The cleavage of APP by presenilin, which results in the secretion of A bin the extracellular space, also causes release of APP IntraCellularDomain (AICD) in the cytoplasm. AICD is a small peptide of 50-59residues, and when released from the membrane it has been shown to alter signaling pathways, modulate gene transcription and cause apoptosis in vitro in tissue culture cells. Methods: We generated a transgenic mouse model to study the in vivo effects of AICD. We used CaMKII apromoter to drive expression of AICD transgene in postnatal forebrain and hippocampalneurons. Mice were aged and were tested at different time points forbehavioral deficits. The brains were analyzed by biochemical and histochemical procedures for the presence of AD-related pathological features.Results: We found that the AICD transgenic a number AD-related pathological feature in a time-dependent manner. the transgenic mice developed neuroinflamma- tion, tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, memory impair-ments and neurodegeneration. In addition, they also showed aberrant neural activity and reduced adult neurogenesis. These patho- logies occurred without any increase in the amyloid load or the deposition of amyloid plaques. Also, a number of these features wererescued by treating mice with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen. Discussion: Our findings show that AICD alone is able to cause AD- related pathologies in pre-clinical settings. Since the brains from ADpatients show higher levels of AICD compared to non-demented individuals, these data suggest that AICD can also contribute to clinical AD. We will summarize the pathological effects of increased levels ofAPP or APP metabolites and discuss how our studies add to theknowledge base. These findings, together with the observations that other non-amyloid mechanisms can be operative in AD, provide oneS66 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencepossible explanation for the lack of success of A b-directed therapeutic strategies in clinical trials. We will present data that suggest the mechanism underlying the effects of AICD and discuss how this new insight into disease pathogenesis provides potential novel ways fortherapeutic intervention.Disclosure: S.W. Pimplikar, Mitochondrial Membrane Channel Altered Mitochondrial Dynamics Including Decreased Neurite Regenerationand Amyloid Cascade Allen D. Roses* Deane Drug Discovery Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC Background: The association of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes, particularly the carriage of the APOE e4 allele, with the risk and age of onset of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) remains the mostconfirmed example of a genetic association for a complex disease. However, it lacks sufficient specificity and sensitivity for application in clinical practice. Recent published data supports the hypothesis thatage of onset distribution of Alzheimer's Disease can be predicted by avariable polyT polymorphism in the TOMM40 gene, inherited over evolution in different ethnic groups. Methods: 10-fold Sanger sequencing of the APOE-TOMM40 linkage disequilibrium region and analyzed all polymorphisms [SNPs andCNVs] using phylogenetic methodology in several independent series of AD patients and controls matched for APOE genotypes. Results: We have identified a polymorphic poly-T variant locus, rs10524523, in the TOMM40 gene that provides greatly increased precision in the estimation of AD risk and disease onset for APOE e3 carriers. In two independent clinical cohorts, longer lengths ofrs10524523 were associated with a higher risk for LOAD. For APOEe3/e4 patients who developed LOAD after age 60, individuals with long poly-T repeats linked to APOE e3 develop LOAD an average of 7 years earlier than individuals with shorter poly-T repeats linked to APOE e3 (70.5 years \u00b11.2 versus 77.6 years \u00b12.1, P \u00bc0.02, n \u00bc34). The age of onset distribution data have been confirmed in a prospectively followed ''normal'' cohort from Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona. Additional psychological and imaging biomarkers have been related[University of Wisconsin] and may be predicted, by the size of thepolyT repeats on each chromosome. Discussion: The genetic data focus the pathogenic process on the variable intraneuronal interactions of apoE3 (1-272) and/or apoE4(1-272) with the mitochondrial outer molecular membrane channel protein. The TOMM40 gene contains this intronic polyT polymor- phism. The role of the sizes of each of the polyTs on each inheritedDNA strand are under investigation but include creating differencesin exon splicing and quantitative expression. The cascade of amyloid is a variable consequence over time of the rate of mitochondrial apoptosis, with the apoE molecules functioning as ''pro-apoptoticdeath signals.'' Cytochrome c is released and catalyzes the caspasepathways leading to a subsequent aggregation of amyloid and other cellular proteins. The prospective validation of the AD age-specific risk estimates will be tested in a combination diagnostic validation, anddelay of onset clinical trial. The design of this study has been accepted by the FDA and negotiations with pharmaceutical partners are underway.Disclosure: A.D.

Neuroimaging Biomarker Options for Monitoring Alzheimer's Disease TreatmentsGary Small*, Vladimir Graham B. Cole, Markus Donix, AlisonBurggren, Susan Y. Bookheimer, Jorge Barrio UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior, Los Angeles, CA, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA Background: Neurodegeneration and age-related cognitive decline afflict millions of people: 20% of those aged 65 or older have mild cognitive impairment, and 10% have Alzheimer's disease or relateddementias. Recent research has focused on developing brain imagingto track neuropathological changes associated with these conditions, particularly amyloid senile plaques. However, several available techniques label alternative structures and mechanisms, such as tauaccumulation, synaptic activity, and inflammation - all useful targets for monitoring novel treatments. Methods: A review of recent structural and functional imaging studies from UCLA and other centers will be used to demonstrate how severalmethods provide varied data that assist in detecting neurodegeneration and monitoring interventions. Results: Voxel-based MRI morphometry indicates the predictive value of medial temporal atrophy and its potential utility in clinicaltrials. Although brain volume measures may lack target specificity, high-resolution MRI and cortical unfolding methods have identified medial temporal subregions that may improve MRI utilityfor clinical trial monitoring. [F-18]FDG-PET provides measures of synaptic activity through regional glucose metabolism, and findings from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative indicate thatits use can reduce the number of subjects needed for a rando-mized clinical trial. Cholinesterase inhibitor and anti-inflammatory drug trials have demonstrated significant effects on both [F-18]FDG- PET signals and cognitive measures. A randomized clinical trialof the anti-amyloid, humanized monoclonal antibody bapineuzumabresulted in a modest decrease in [C-11]PIB-PET signals but only limited treatment efficacy on cognitive measures. [F-18]FDDNP-PET, which measures tau neurofibrillary tangles as well as amyloid senileplaques, predicts future cognitive decline in normal aging and mildcognitive impairment. [F-18]FDDNP-PET signals are associated with cerebrospinal fluid tau levels, and studies of supranuclear palsy (a pure tauopathy) demonstrate high signals in brain regions withhigh concentrations of tauopathy. Although [F-18]FDDNP-PET has not yet been studied in a clinical treatment trial, it may prove particularly useful in monitoring anti-Alzheimer's treatments since tau tangles are closely associated with disease progression.Discussion: A variety of imaging techniques provides opportunities to track neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in treatment trials. Choice of a particular method should depend upon the knownmechanism of action of the treatment. Thus, [F-18]FDDNP-PET wouldbe a reasonable choice for monitoring anti-tau treatments, while [18]FDG-PET would be more appropriate for tracking drugs that directly affect synaptic function. Combining multiple neuroimagingmethods (e.g., structural MRI plus PET) may improve specificity and sensitivity and offer added value to using only one imaging technique. Disclosure: G.W.

Radioligands for PET Imaging of Cannabinoid Receptors Type 1 and Type 2Andrew Horti*, Yongjun Alena Savonenko, Robert Dannals Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MDBackground: Cannabinoid receptors subtype 1 (CB 1) and subtype 2 (CB 2) and cannabinoid drugs constitute a vibrant field in modern medicine and pharmacology. However, the physiological and pharma- cological roles played by the cannabinoids are still not fully under-stood. Positron-emission tomography (PET) is the most advancedimaging technique for non-invasive research of receptors. Quanti- tative PET imaging of CB 1and CB 2in animal and humans has been limited by the drawbacks of the available radioligands. The latestresearch has revealed several CB 1PET radioligands with improved imaging properties. Molecular imaging of the CB 1receptor in human brain with these radioligands has now become possible and their application is underway. The CB 2receptor is found in the immune system and is also expressed in small quantities in normal brain tissue.There are multiple lines of evidence that CB 2is upregulated under many pathological conditions including neuroinflammation (NI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis and cancer. PET CB 2 radioligands for human use are not available. A836339 (2,2,3,3- tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid [3-(2-methoxy-ethyl)-4,5-di- methyl-3H-thiazol-(2 Z)-ylidene]amide) was recently developed Abbott as a selective CB 2agonist (K i\u00bc0.64 nM). The radiosynthesis of [11C]A836339, [11C]-1and its evaluation in mouse models of NI and AD is presented as a novel approach to image NI and AD. Methods :[11C]-1was prepared by11C-methylation of the corresponding alcohol derivative. Whole body and regional brain distribution of[11C]-1were studied in control mice and after blockade with selective CB2ligands. The mouse model of NI (mice treated with lipopoly- saccharide (LPS)), and mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1dE9) wereused in these studies. Results :[11C]-1was prepared with a radiochemical yield of 26%, radiochemical purity 499% and specific radioactivity of 300 TBq/ mmol. [11C]-1exhibited low uptake in the control brain (0.4%ID/g tissue) with little specific binding. The whole body distribution of [11C]-1in control mice demonstrated high specific uptake in the CB 2 rich spleen. Uptake of [11C]-1in the LPS (NI) mouse brain regions was significantly greater than that in controls (ratio up to 3.3). Blockingwith various CB 2ligands (60% blockade) demonstrated that binding of [11C]-1in the LPS mouse brain is mediated by CB2 receptors. A regional brain distribution study (baseline and blockade) of [11C]-1in AD mice demonstrated 36% specific CB 2binding in the cortex and lower binding in all other brain regions. The CB 2specific binding is consistent with distribution of the A bamyloid plaques in this model of AD.Discussion :[11C]-1, a new selective CB 2radioligand with high binding affinity, has been synthesized. [11C]-1manifests low uptake in the normal mouse brain, but it specifically radiolabels the cerebral CB 2 receptors in vivo in mouse models of NI and AD. These results suggest that [11C]-1is a candidate for PET imaging of CB 2receptors in neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease. Disclosure: A.G.

The SCZ cohort consisted of 9 males and 1 female, with a mean ageof 42\u00b19 years, ranging from ages 30-54 including 7 AA, 1 A and 2 C. The occupancy study was with 7 HC and 4 SCZ with AVE1625, an antagonist for CB1. Results: Imaging with baseline (11C)OMAR followed by a second PET following 5 h post dosing with a single oral 5-60 mg (HC) and 5-70 mg(SZ). V Twas highest in the globus pallidus and the cortex in both controls and patients with schizophrenia. Controls showed a correla- tion with the known distribution of CB1 and decline of [11C]OMAR binding with age, most significantly in the globus pallidus. Overall, we observed elevated mean binding in patients with schizophrenia across all regions studied, and this increase was statistically significant in thepons (po0.05), by the students t-test. When we ran a regression of the control subjects V Tvalues with age and then compared the patient data to 95% prediction limits of the linear regression, three patients fell completely outside for the globus pallidus, and in all other regionsthere were at least 1-3 patients outside of the prediction intervals. Therewere no statistically significant correlations between PET measures and the BPRS subscores, but there was a significant correlation (po0.05) between V Tand the ratio of the BPRS psychosis to withdrawal score in the frontal lobe (r \u00bc0.49), parietal lobe(r \u00bc0.60), and regions (r \u00bc0.71 and r \u00bc0.79 respectively). For the occupancy studies, after a single dose of AVE1625, CB1 brain occupancy (36-90%) was demonstrated for HCand 25-69% SZ. Discussion: In conclusion, [11C]OMAR can image human CB1 receptors in normal aging and schizophrenia and shows strongevidence of an association of elevated binding specific brain regionsand symptoms of the disease.

Pertwee*, Daniele Bolognini, Maria Grazia Cascio, FrancescaComelli, Barbara Costa, Lisa A. Gauson Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom, Department of Biotechnology & Bioscience, Uni- versity of Milano-Bicocca, Milano, Italy There is growing evidence that plant cannabinoids in addition to D9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol possess pharmacological properties that could possibly be exploited in the clinic, one of thesephytocannabinoids being D9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV). We have reported previously that THCV displays significant potency as aC B 1receptor antagonist, both in vitro and in vivo . The present investigation has yielded evidence that THCV can also behave as aCB 2receptor agonist, again both in vitro and in vivo . The measured in vitro response was inhibition of cyclic AMP production stimulated by 10 mM forskolin in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells either transfected with human CB 2receptors untransfected (n \u00bc4). Cannabinoids were administered in dimethyl sulphoxide and EC 50 and E max values calculated using GraphPad Prism 5. For in vivo experiments, acute inflammation was induced in the right hind paws ofadult male C57BL/6J mice by intraplantar injection of carrageenan.Mice were injected intraperitoneally 30 min before carrageenan with THCV or its vehicle, ethanol:cremophorEL:saline 1:1:18, and paw oedema was assessed 2 h after carrageenan. Data are expressed asmeans and variability as SEM or 95% confidence limits (CLs). In vivo values were compared by Student's t test or, for multiple comparisons, by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-hoc test (n\u00bc8 1/CB 2receptor agonist, CP55940, inhibited cyclic AMP production by CB 2CHO cells. Their EC 50 values with 95% CLs shown in parentheses were 38 nM (12 & 124 nM)and 6.9 nM (3.5 & 13 nM), respectively, their corresponding E maxvalues being 40% (32 & and 55% CP55940 wereantagonized the CB 2-selective antagonist/inverse agonist, AM630. Importantly, the cells used in these experiments were preincubated with 10 mM AM630 for up to 24 h and then subjected to intense washing as we found this procedure causes subsequently administered AM630 to behave as an apparent neutral CB 2receptor antagonist rather than as a CB 2receptor antagonist/inverse THCV nor CP55940 inhibitedcyclic AMP production in untransfected CHO cells. In contrast to its vehicle, which did not significantly affect paw oedema, THCV (0.3 mg/kg) decreased the mean volume of carrageenan-injectedhind paws from 114 \u00b19.2mlt o8 0\u00b10.8ml(Po0.05). This ability to reduce SR144528 plus THCV. THCV behaves as a reasonably potent CB 2receptor agonist in vitro and induces reductions in oedema that seem to be CB 2receptor- mediated in an in vivo model of acute inflammation. Accordingly, THCV may have therapeutic potential as an anti-inflammatoryagent. Our discovery that THCV activates CB 2receptors but blocks CB1receptors, raises the possibility that it also has therapeutic potential for the management of Parkinson's disease (PD), chronic liver diseases and stroke. Indeed, evidence has recently emergedfrom experiments using a rat model of PD that THCV may be effectiveboth at delaying disease progression in PD and at ameliorating parkinsonian symptoms.

Felder* Neuroscience Division, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN Both phyto and small molecule cannabinoid therapeutics have entered the clinical arena with both successes and failures. Medical marijuana and mimetics such as levonantrodol, nabilone, and marinol progressedto late stage clinical testing and beyond, but were deemed suboptimaldue to dysphoric side effects. Direct acting cannabinoid agonists, particularly at the CB-1 receptor, result in undesirable central effects including dysphoria, dizziness, thought disturbance, and somnolence.A new focus on blocking the endocannabinoid inactivation mechanismto provide a more physiologic cannabinoid receptor stimulation mechanism suggests that separation of the therapeutic benefit from psychotropic side effects may be possible. Inhibition physiologic elevation of endocannabinoid tone and desirable preclinical efficacy without concomitant motor orbehavior disturbances in rodents and non-human primates.

Panel Session Emerging Nanotechnology-Based Drug Delivery Methods and Their Applications to Addiction Research Programmed Transdermal Delivery of Addictive Substances Through Voltage Gated Carbon Nanotube MembranesBruce J. Hinds* University of Kentucky, Lexington, KYAddiction treatment is one of the most difficult health care challenges due to the mixture of complex changing neurochemical pathways and psychological behavior. Generally the most effective treatments require psychological monitoring/counseling and adaption of therapeutictechniques. For large population addiction, such as nicotine, it is costand time prohibitive to have face to face meetings. A promising system is where a dosing regiment (within a doctors' prescription limit) can be remotely programmed to account for daily environmental factors, patient input, and counselor feedback from phone interviews orinternet-based surveys. Needed for this system is an ultra low power, compact, and programmable delivery device not currently available with electroporation or mechanical pumps. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)have three key attributes that make them of great interest for novel applications such as programmed drug delivery; 1) atomically flat graphite surface allows for ideal fluid slip boundary conditions andthousand fold faster fluid flow 2) the cutting process to open CNTsinherently places 'gate keeper' valve chemistry at CNT core entrance and 3) CNT are electrically conductive allowing for electrochemical reactions and application of electric fields gradients at CNT tips.S69 ACNP 49th Annual ConferenceTowards this goal, a composite membrane structure containing vertically aligned carbon nanotubes passing across a polystyrene matrix film have been fabricated [Science 2004]. Pressure driven flux of a variety of solvents (H2O, hexane, decane ethanol, methanol) are4-5 orders of magnitude faster than conventional Newtonian flow dueto atomically flat graphite planes inducing nearly ideal slip conditions [Nature 2005]. These properties are nearly ideal for introducing efficient electro-phoretic and electro-osmotic flow to be used as thebasis of a programmed transdermal delivery device. CNT tips arefunctionalized with a high density of negative charge allowing only the unidirectional flow of positive cations under small bias, thus inducing an efficient flux of neutral molecules. Efficiencies as high as 1neutral molecule per ion are seen in the small CNT pores, allowingstandard watch batteries to operate for 2 weeks. These CNT membranes are 400 fold more energy efficient than conventional nanoporous materials. An in-vitro cell, composed of a reference electrode, reservoir solution, CNT membrane electrode, gel contact and human skin sample were assembled in a Franz cell.

Development of Novel Delivery Systems and Manufacturing Methods Based on Nanotechnology James Talton* Nanotherapeutics, Alachua, FLThe absorption of nanoparticles from the gastrointestinal tract to improve the absorption rate and/or bioavailability has great potentialfor almost all classes of pharmaceuticals. While many currentlyavailable pharmaceuticals are delivered without absorption diffi- culties, such as orally, there is an increasing need to develop delivery systems for drugs with low solubility and/or permeability to obtainthe desired pharmacological effect. Nanoparticle delivery involvesseveral crucial parameters that influence uptake, such as particle diameter, the nature of the particle and surface characeristics that effect targeting to and uptake into cells. Post-absorptive events,including translocation processes, are suggested to be as important as initial uptake into the epithelial cells or M-cells of the gut associated lymphoid tissue. Many insoluble compounds are dry or wet milled inorder to increase the dissolution properties, which results in anincreased absorption after oral administration for compounds with substantial permeability of the free drug in solution. Unfortunately, many insoluble compounds as well as water-soluble and proteindrugs also have low permeability across membranes limiting therapiesto injectable routes. Administration of drug nanoparticles, nano- carriers, and microencapsulated particles have also been described that provide protection from enzymatic degradation and slow-release fromdiffusion of drug from hydrophobic bioerodible / biodegradable polymers. Particle interactions on the nanometer or micrometer scale have been shown to promote particle growth and agglomeration,and are inherently unstable without surface modifiers. The describedinvention describes multi-component compositions and methods to manufacture stable drug PDSs into patient-friendly FDFs that retain significantly improved biological properties with high shelf-lifestability. Particulate delivery systems, or PDSs, in the form ofnanoparticles, microparticles, and microencapsulated particles, are usually formed either by size reduction (dry or wet milling), spray-drying, precipitation upon addition of a non-solvent, gellingthe drug / polymer upon changing the pH or addition of a precipi- tating ions (salts), or complexing a drug with a polymer of anopposite charge. These systems, however, tend to be characterized by poor reproducibility and scalability in manufacturing, low encapsulation efficiencies, damage/denaturation of the drug when it is a macromolecule due to the use of organic solvents and / or spray-drying, and poor shelf-life.

Prasad, Stanley A. Schwartz SUNY at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY Background: Gold nanoparticles (GNP), specifically gold nanorods (GNR), are useful for a range of biomedical applications due to their biocompatibility and their ability to bind and deliver manybiomolecules. Their surfaces can be modified to incorporate cationic charges which can form stable electrostatic complexes with anionic nucleic acids such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), for the purposeof targeted gene silencing. The parallel epidemics of drug addictionand human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infections are major public health problems worldwide. Addictive drugs are risk factors for acquiring HIV-1 infections and may facilitate the pathogenesis of HIVencephalopathy. The 32-kDa dopamine associated with dopa- minergic neurons in the brain, is involved in the pathogenesis of drug addiction. Previous studies demonstrated that drugs of abuseenhance HIV-1 infection. Thus we investigated the effects of silencing DARPP-32 expression using nanotechnology on the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infections.Methods: Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and primary normal human astrocytes (NHA) were treated in vitro with either methamphetamine or heroin. Further, GNR were complexed with DARPP-32 siRNA to form ''nanoplexes'' which also were used to treatcultures of MDM and NHA. Uptake of nanoplexes into the cells wasdetermined using dark-field imaging of GNR. Gene and protein expression were analyzed by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. MDM were infected in vitro using HIV-1 and p24 antigen expression was determined using ELISA.Results: We note for the first time that DARPP-32 is expressed by MDM. Methamphetamine or heroin significantly upregulated DARPP-32 expression by MDM and NHA. Uptake of nanoplexeswithin the cytoplasm of cells was observed by dark-field imaging. Effective gene silencing by the nanoplexes was evidenced by a reduction in the expression of DARPP-32 in MDM and NHA, withno observed cell cytotoxicity. DARPP-32 silencing resulted insignificant modulation of the activity of downstream effector molecules such as ERK and CREB. DARPP-32 silencing decreased p24 antigen production in MDM infected with HIV-1 in vitro . DARPP-32 silencing prevented an increase in p24 antigen productioninduced by drugs of abuse in MDM. Moreover gene expression of DARPP-32 was increased in MDM isolated from HIV-1 subjects. Discussion: While DARPP-32 plays a significant role in signal transduction within the CNS and is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of addictive behaviors, we have demonstrated that it also is expressed by immunocompetent cells and is associated withimmunoregulatory activities. As drugs of abuse have been shown toincrease susceptibility to and progression of HIV-1 infections, nanoparticle-mediated silencing of DARPP-32 expression within the immune system of drug using, HIV-1 infected patients may be useful inmanaging the progression of their infections.Disclosure: J.L.

Teicher McLean Hospital, Boston, MABackground: A rapidly developing area in drug addiction research is molecular-level imaging, encompassing the study of receptors, transporters, enzymes, genes and intracellular processes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive visualization techniquewith high spatial resolution, but low sensitivity for visualization ofmolecular targets. In order to improve MRI sensitivity for molecular brain imaging, our goal was to develop small ( o50 nm) Gadolinium (Gd) contrast agents, which can be delivered non-invasively and target specific dopamine receptors in the rat brain.Methods: diethylene-tria- lysine residues. We determined the chelate to protein molar ratio by using a standard Arsenazo III-based spectro-photometric method. We calculated relaxivity for each sample by usingT1 data and Gd concentrations as determined by NMR and spectro- photometric analyses. We then conjugated (D3Ab) residues, and delivered nanoprobes intra- Animals sacrificed hours and delivered intranasally. Brains were removed after 2 hours and autoradiography was performed. Autoradiogramswere developed, quantified and compared with immunohistochemistryand fluorescent images. Results: Electron Microscopy has shown a large proportion of Gd- DTPA-clathrin triskelia with a mean hydrodynamic radius of 20 nm.The mean Chelate/Protein molar ratio was \u00b12.4. DTPA-ITC-Clathrin-Triskelia displayed relaxivity per and 22 mM/C01s/C01per Gd ion. Two hours after intranasal administration D3-Triskelia nanoprobes were found only in D3 in rats. Autoradiography, fluorescent and light micro- scopic examination of the D3 brain regions confirmed specific targeting of D3 receptors with different D3-nanoprobes. Confocal lasermicroscopy confirmed integrity of nanoparticles in brain.Clathrin and D3Ab fluorescence co-localized in D3 brain regions. Discussion: We demonstrated that Clathrin triskelia can serve as robust MRI platforms onto which multiple functional motifs can beadded through chemical modifications; and that small and stiffmolecular structures with large rotational correlation times can exhibit over 400-fold greater molecular relaxivity than any currently approved Triskelia nanoprobes were success-fully nasally delivered non-invasively into the rat brain, were able to target specific dopamine receptors, and remained stable in the rat brain. These preliminary results should encourage further investiga-tions into the use of clathrin triskelia as a new nanoplatform for MRcontrast enhanced molecular brain imaging and drug delivery.

Currently, the causes of OCD are largely unknown. At the neuroanatomical level, surgical lesions and neuropsychological studies have indicated that the dysfunction ofcortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuitry may play a key role in thepathogenesis of OCD. This observation is further supported by functional brain imaging studies which show increased functional activity in orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, the caudatenucleus and the thalamus of OCD patients. Despite these important findings little is known about the mechanisms underlying the dysfunction of cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuitry in OCD.Methods: We deleted SAPA3 gene in mice using homologous recombination in ES cells. A Cre-inducible BAC transgenic mouse was generated by placing floxed STOP cassette in front of ATG codon of the gene and D2R-Cre wereobtained from GENSAT. Grooming behavior was recorded with 24-hour video taping in home cage and scored by investigators blinded to genotypes. Elevated zero test and dark-light emergence test were used to measure anxiety-like behavior.Results: We hypothesize that dysfunction of the cortico-striatal glutamatergic synapses plays a key role in compulsive and repetitive behavior. Using genetic approaches in mice we show that deletion of SAPAP3, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein highly expressed in thestriatum and critical for synaptic function, leads to increased anxiety and compulsive-like grooming behavior resulting in facial skin lesions; both were alleviated by treatment with a selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitor. Electrophysiological, structural, and biochemical studies ofSAPAP3 mutant mice revealed defects in cortico-striatal synapses. Furthermore, lentivirus-mediated selective expression of SAPAP3 in the striatum rescued the synaptic and behavioral defects of SAPAP3mutant mice. To directly dissect the relative contribution of the directand indirect pathways in compulsive/repetitive behavior in SAPPA3 mutant mice, we generated Cre-inducible SAPAP3 transgenic mice. We selectively induced SAPAP3 transgene expression in medium spinyneurons (MSNs) of the direct or indirect pathway in SAPAP3 mutant mice, by crossing the inducible SAPAP3 transgenic mice to D1R-Cre and D2R-Cre mice, respectively. We found that selective expression ofSAPAP3 transgene in MSNs of the directly pathway, but not MSNs ofthe indirectly pathway, rescued the compulsive/repetitive grooming behavior in SAPAP3 mutant mice. Discussion: Our results provide direct evidence for a critical role of cortico-striatal glutamatergic synapses in compulsive/repetitive beha-vior, and illustrate the importance of synaptic dysfunction of the direct pathway of the basal ganglia in such behavior.

We also examined the effect of effective vs. ineffective antidepressant treatments for OCD on 5-HT1B receptor expression and functional coupling in brain regionsimplicated in OCD.Methods: Mice were treated chronically with clomipramine, fluoxetine, or desipramine. Mice then received acute 5-HT1B agonist challenge and were assessed for PPI and perseverative hyperlocomotion.Additionally, separate groups of mice were treated with fluoxetinefor 4, 14, 21, 28, or 56 days and assessed for OCD-like behavior or depression-like behavior for comparison. Finally, 5-HT1B receptor expression and G-protein coupling were assessed in the orbitofrontalcortex (OFC), dorsofrontalcortex (dFC), caudate/putamen and nucleus accumbens following chronic Results: Only chronic treatment with SRIs attenuated reversal of 5-HT1B-induced 3-4 weeks to emerge, while reversal of depression-like behavior required 2 weeks. Chronic SRI treatment reduced 5-HT1B receptor expression in the OFC.Conclusions: Our results show that 5-HT1B-induced OCD-like behaviors are reduced by chronic administration of effective, but not ineffective, treatments for OCD. Furthermore, SRIs reverse OCD-like behavior weeks after they reduce depression-like behavior,as observed in clinical populations. Our findings also suggest that downregulation of 5-HT1B receptors in the OFC may underlie the therapeutic effects of SRIs in OCD. This novel mouse model providesa tool for identifying the neural substrates underlying aspectsof OCD, and the therapeutic mechanisms of SRIs in this disorder. Disclosure: S.C. Dulawa: None. Role Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY Background: There are several disorders that have OCD-like clinical manifestations, such as Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. Recent human genetic analyses have linked the SLITRK1 gene to thesepathological conditions, though the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The Slitrk1 gene belongs to a new family of six members (Slitrk1-6) encoding one-pass transmembrane proteins,which contain two extracellular domains,similar to Slit proteins, and a carboxy-terminal domain that is similar to Trk neurotrophin receptors. These proteins have been shown to affect neuronal process outgrowth. Slitrk1 knockout mice exhibitelevated anxiety-like behaviors, but do not show any other behavioralabnormalities. Though little is known about Slitrk1, the function of other members of Slitrk family remains obscure. We hypothesized that abnormal expression of Slitrk5 may lead to behavioral phenotypessimilar to the involvement of SLITRK1 in Tourette's syndrome. In order to investigate the function of this protein and to delineate the expression pattern of the Slitrk5 gene in mouse tissues, we generated aknockout/knockin mouse by replacing Slitrk5 gene with a reportergene. Methods: Slitrk5-/- and WT littermate mice were tested at different postnatal ages in obsessive-compulsive and anxiety related behavioral,with subsequent evaluation of neuronal morphology in relevant brainregions. Results: We have observed that targeted inactivation of Slitrk5 in mice leads to OCD-like behavioral phenotypes, including overgroomingwith elements of self-mutilation, by selectiveserotonin abnormalities instriatal anatomy and cell morphology, as well as alterations in gluta- mate receptor composition, which contribute to deficient cortico- striatal neurotransmission. Discussion: Overall, our data suggest that Slitrk5 may play a central role in the development of OCD-like behaviors. While humangenetic studies have implicated another Slitrk family member, SLITRK1, in Tourette's syndrome, these associations have not been consistently replicated. In this context, our studies link Slitrk5 tocore symptoms of OCD: self-injurious repetitive behavior andincreased anxiety. In all, we provide a novel animal model of OCD-like behaviors, involving a novel neuronal transmembrane protein, which modulates region-specific glutamatergic neuro-transmission. This model can be used to further dissect the role ofSlitrk5 in molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Disclosure: F.S. Lee, None. Using Translatable Human Biomarkers to Assess Clinical Relevance of Mouse Models of Obsessive Compulsive DisorderSusanne E. Ahmari*, Bina Risbrough, A. Siegelbaum, Edward E. Smith, Mark Geyer, Rene \u00b4Hen, Helen Blair Simpson Columbia University/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, Columbia University, New York, NY, University Of California, San Diego, CA Background : Though Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is one of the most disabling and chronic psychiatric disorders, with 2-3% lifetime prevalence, the pathophysiology underlying OCD remainsunclear. This is partly because it is difficult to make OCD mouse models that recapitulate symptoms in multiple cognitive, behavioral, and emotional domains: obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviors,and anxiety. In addition, individual patients display widely variableobsessions, compulsions, and anxiety levels, rendering it difficult to establish a unified group of symptoms to model in animals. To address this problem, we have created a framework for performing parallelstudies in humans and mice to help determine whether animal modelshave relevance to human OCD symptoms. As an example, we apply this framework to HCN1 [hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleo- tide-gated channel 1] behavior. Methods : Humans: 21 unmedicated OCD subjects and matched healthy controls were tested in prepulse inhibition (PPI) and a Stop SignalReaction Time (SSRT) task. Clinical measures were obtained with 18 mg/kg fluoxetine vs vehicle for 4 weeks. Groups were tested in a behavioral battery ofobsessive-compulsive and anxiety-related tasks before and afterfluoxetine treatment. Results : Humans: We found impaired PPI in unmedicated OCD subjects (prepulse intensities: 78 dB and 86 dB). We also found animprovement in the ability of OCD subjects to inhibit behavioral responses compared to matched controls, represented by a smaller Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT \u00bcan estimate of the time taken to stop a response). This difference was linked to an overall slowerreaction time in OCD patients, and increased accuracy on the task. Mice: Mice with constitutive knockout of HCN1 pacemaker channelsexhibited an abnormal repetitive arching behavior that was absent inWT littermates. Arching was alleviated chronic treatment withhigh-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used in our OCD treatment studies. We also noted an increase in PPI in HCN1 /C0//C0mice following fluoxetine treatment. Studies of SSRT are ongoing.Discussion : We have demonstrated abnormalities in two translatable neurocognitive tasks (PPI, SSRT) in OCD patients vs matched healthyS72 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencecontrols. This is the first study to examine these candidate endophenotypes in unmedicated OCD subjects. 1) Our human results confirm that PPI abnormalities are seen in OCD subjects, and support use of PPI to help validate OCD mouse models.2) Though we also see abnormalities in the SSRT, our findings runcounter to the published literature (i.e. we see improved inhibition in OCD subjects); this result can be reconciled by our finding that OCD patients sacrificed speed on the task in favor of improving overallaccuracy. This suggests caution in using this task as a reliabletranslatable biomarker. 3) We illustrate the process of applying translatable biomarkers using the HCN1 /C0//C0mouse model, which demonstrates repetitive behavior and PPI increases after fluoxetine treatment.4) Further work is needed in the field to identify additional reliable translatable biomarkers of OCD; these in turn will increase our ability to validate mouse models, which can be used to dissect the molecularand cellular substrates underlying OCD pathophysiology. Session Glutamatergic Anomalies in Alcoholism: Exciting Advances from Studies of Mice, Rats and Man In Vivo Translational Study of Brain Glutamate in Aging and AlcoholismNatalie May Zahr*, Dirk Mayer, Meng Gu, Edith V. Sullivan, Adolf Pfefferbaum Stanford University, Stanford, CA, SRI International, Menlo Park, CA Background: In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) permits translational study through noninvasive longitudinal tracking of brain chemistry changes caused by human aging and substance abuse andexperimental manipulations in models. A metabolite of particularinterest to mechanisms of alcoholism neurotoxicity and age-related neurodegeneration is glutamate (Glu). Advances in MRS acquisition parameters now permit the direct in vivo detection and quantification of Glu and glutamine (Gln) at high magnetic field-strengths. As Glu ispredominately neuronal Gln a glial advances enable in vivo investigation of neuron-glial metabolic interactions and alterations in glutamatergic synaptic regulation by conditions affectingthese constituents. Methods: MRS detection of Glu overcame challenges from spectral overlap with signals from other metabolites and a complicatedmultiplet structure due to strong J-coupling through the applicationof Constant Time PRESS (CT-PRESS), which enabled separation and quantification of Glu and Gln. In humans, CT-PRESS examined the effects of age in 3 brain regions targeted by cortical glutamatergicefferents-basal ganglia, cerebellum, and pons-and to test whetherperformance on frontally based cognitive tests would correlate with regional Glu levels. In rats, CT-PRESS examined the effects of 16 and 24 wks of vaporized EtOH exposure on basal ganglia Glu and Gln levelsand associated liver condition. Results: Healthy elderly individuals (77 \u00b15yo) had lower Glu in basal ganglia but not pons or cerebellum than young adults (26 \u00b14yo). Levels of basal ganglia Glu correlated selectively with cognitive testsshowing age-related decline. In rats, 16 wks of EtOH exposure (blood alcohol levels (BAL) \u00bc293 mg/dL) resulted in higher Gln levels in the EtOH than control group. After 24 wks, when Gln levels no longerdistinguished the groups, Glu levels were higher in the EtOH(BAL \u00bc445 mg/dL) than Con group. Discussion: In humans, selective relations between performance and basal ganglia Glu provide in vivo support for age-related modification of Glu levels as contributing to cognitive decline in normal aging. Inrats, mild liver damage in the EtOH group suggests a mechanism for brain changes in Gln and Glu: liver failure impairs the major organ forammonia (NH 3) elimination via the urea cycle and can lead to elevated brain NH 3. The mechanism of brain NH 3detoxification is the formation of Gln from Glu by the enzyme Gln synthetase. With prolonged EtOH exposure, Gln synthetase levels may be compromised,leading to a build-up of Glu. These findings demonstrate the potentialofin vivo MRS to contribute to a mechanistic understanding of glutamatergic system modification in the development of alcoholism and the age-related cognitive decline.

Thoma*, Charles Gasparovic, Paul Mullins, Ronald A. Yeo,Arvind Caprihan, David Ruhl University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, CA, MIND Research Network, Albuquerque, NM, Mind Research Network, Albuquerque, NM Background: Acute ethanol exposure inhibits NMDA glutamate (Glu) receptors and sudden withdrawl from chronic alcohol use may lead to an increased activation of these receptors with excitotoxic effects. Inthe longer term, brain levels of Glu and its metabolites, such asglutamine (Gln), are likely to be altered, providing a measure of overall glutamatergic dysfunction. However, few studies have assessed concentrations of these metabolites in clinical populations ofindividuals either actively abusing alcohol or currently in prolonged remission. Methods :Twenty-two healthy controls were compared to a group of 17 participants with alcohol dependence, ten with active dependence(AD) and seven in remission for at least one year (AD-R). Neurometabolite concentrations were measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS) in a predominantly gray matter voxel including the bilateral anterior cingulate gyri. Tissue segmenta-tion provided an assessment of the proportion of gray matter in the 1H-MRS voxel. The Drinker Inventory of Consequences Scale (DrInC) exam was administered to all participants.Results: Glu was significantly lower and Gln was significantly higher in the AD and AD-R groups relative to the control group; no other neurometabolite concentrations differed across groups. These results were not confounded by age, proportion of gray matter in the1H-MRS voxel, or smoking history. Neurometabolite concentrations did not differ across AD and AD-R groups. Subsequent regressions in the combined clinical group, treating voxel gray matter proportion as acovariate, revealed that both the absolute concentration of Gln, and theGln/Glu ratio, were positively correlated with total score on the DrInC, while gray matter proportion was negatively correlated with the DrinC. Conclusions: The current findings of higher Gln and lower Glu in the combined AD-A and AD-R groups indicate a perturbation of the Gln-Glu cycle. The absence of any difference between AD and AD-R groups suggests that glutamatergic dysfunction either predates the onset of abuse or persists long after prolonged alcohol abstinence.Disclosure: R.J.

Deehan, William Truitt,William McBride Indiana University: School of Medicine, Indianapolis, INBackground: The transition from controlled drug consumption to uncontrollable intake has been hypothesized to involve alterations inthe glutamate (Glu) system in the corticolimbic (CL) pathway. While past research has focused on alterations in the Glu system produced by administration of a single drug of abuse (i.e., cocaine), the vastS73 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencemajority of human drug use is characterized by polydrug abuse. In alcoholics the rate of concurrent nicotine dependence can exceed 92%. Therefore, elucidating the effects of co-abuse of ethanol and nicotine on the Glu system in the CL pathway could provide insightsinto alterations observed in the human condition.Methods: Ethanol (EtOH) can alter the Glu system in the CL. Briefly, Wistar rats were implanted with guide cannuale aimed at the VTA. One week later, rats received injections of 0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 g/kg EtOHduring conventional microdialysis procedures. Recently, we havedeveloped an EtOH-Nicotine (Nic) co-abuse model. Alcohol-preferring (P) rats will readily consume EtOH-Nic solutions. P rats given 1 h operant access to EtOH-Nic solutions will orally consume the tworeinforcers at a level which is intoxicating (BECs 4120 mg%) and results in high levels of Nic self-administration ( 48 mg/kg). Following a 10 day abstinence period, a No-Net Flux microdialysis experiment was conducted to assess basal Glu levels and clearance in the medialprefrontal cortex (mPFC) in P rats that were drug na \u00a8ve, EtOH- exposed, or with a past history of EtOH-Nic co-abuse. Similar to the period of initiation of EtOH-Nic co-abuse in humans, P rats willreadily consume EtOH-Nicotine solutions during adolescence. P ratswere allowed to water, EtOH, Nic, or EtOH-Nic during periadolescence (PND 30-60), but were drug abstinence for 40 days prior to sample collection (PND 100). The gene expression of G-couplereceptors in the nucleus accumbens shell and anterior cingulate inthese rats were determined through the use of a focused microarray. Results: In the initial microdialysis study, extracellular Glu levels in the VTA were increased in rats administered a low dose (0.5 g/kg; 35%increase) of EtOH, but reduced at a higher dose (2.0 g/kg; 20% decrease). The No-Net Flux data indicated that Glu clearance in the mPFC was significantly reduced in P rats with a past history of EtOHor EtOH-Nic self-administration. The focused microarray analysisrevealed that EtOH usage during periadolescence produced numerous alterations in G-coupled receptors during adulthood, including the expression of Glu receptors in the nucleusaccumbens shell (some unique to the EtOH-Nic group).Discussion: The initial results indicated that low dose ethanol stimulates glutamatergic projections to the VTA, suggesting that VTA glutamate may be involved in the activating and reinforcingeffects of EtOH. The reduction in Glu clearance following chronicEtOH and EtOH-Nic consumption (No-Net Flux data) would theoretically translate into Glu lasting longer in the synaptic cleft, possibly having enhanced post-synaptic actions. The findings of thefocused microarray data set indicated that consumption of EtOH or EtOH-Nic can produce long term alterations in the Glu system in the CL. Overall, the data indicate that consumption of EtOH or EtOH-Nicresults in acute and chronic alterations of the Glu system in the CLpathway, and that the development of pharmacotherapeutics for the treatment of alcoholism and/or alcohol-nicotine co-abuse should include the Glu system.Disclosure: Z.A.

Cozzoli University of California at Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CABackground: Alcohol is a drug of abuse well-characterized to affect both pre- and postsynaptic aspects of glutamate neurotransmission and in recent years, converging proteonomic, behavioral genetic and pharmacological evidence supports a potential role for the scaffolding/signaling molecule Homer in regulating alcohol-induced glutamateplasticity of relevance to addiction and alcoholism. Methods: A series of neurochemical and immunoblotting studies were performed on groups of mice trained to binge drink alcohol, as well asmice exhibiting high vs. low binge alcohol drinking phenotypes toexamine for relations between mesocorticolimbic levels of extracellular glutamate, as well as glutamate receptor and Homer, and binge alcoholdrinking. Behavioral pharmacological and genetic approaches were then used to examine the role for mGluR5/Homer2/PI3 K and PKCepsilon signaling within the nucleus accumbens (NAC) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in the propensity to bingealcohol drink.Results: A history of binge alcohol drinking sensitizes the capacity of alcohol to stimulate glutamate release within the NAC. Using 2 distinct models, a history of binge alcohol drinking elevated the expressionand/or activational state of members of the mGluR5/Homer2/PI3K/PKCepsilon signaling pathways within the NAC and CeA, but not in other mesocorticolimbic structures examined. A high alcohol drinking phenotype was also found to be positively associated with elevatedPI3 K and/or PKC signaling within the NAC and inhibition of signalingthrough mGluR5/Homer2 to PI3K and PKCepsilon reduced binge alcohol intake in 2 distinct binge drinking models. Discussion: This collection of data supports the notion that idiopathic or alcohol-induced increases in extended amygdala mGluR5/Homer2 signaling may be critical for the manifestation of binge alcohol drinking behavior and the development of this prevalent form ofalcoholism. This work was funded by NIAAA grant R01AA016650.Disclosure: K.K. Szumlinski, None. Panel Session Pediatric Bipolar Disorder Is a Valid and Prevalent Diagnosis Whose Expression in Children May Include Chronic andSevere Irritability in Place of ''Classical'' Manic Symptoms Supporting the Validity of Pediatric Bipolar Disorder Joseph Biederman* Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MABackground: To evaluate the validity of an early-onset form of bipolar disorder (BPD) in light of ongoing debate and proposed changes inDSM-IV. Methods: A growing number of empirical studies and extensive reviews of the literature 1are amassing evidence for this diagnosis in children and adolescents.Results: The literature indicates that pediatric BPD is a disabling condition characterized by extreme affective and behavioral dysregu- lation, aggression, severe irritability, and a chronic course. Epidemio-logical studies estimate that at least 1% of youth may be affected 2, and clinical studies document that up to 20% of psychiatrically referred children and adolescents satisfy criteria for bipolar spectrum disorderswith many requiring repeated inpatient hospitalizations3. Irritability, which is one of DSM-IV's mood criteria for mania, is the most common abnormal mood associated with pediatric BPD and the one that commonly drives the clinical referral. Studies have noted that thetype of irritability observed in children with mania is extremely severeand arguably distinct from other forms of irritability seen in other psychiatric conditions 4. Studies of children and adolescents show high rates of ADHD in pediatric patients with mania and adults with earlyonset BPD. Since juvenile mania is commonly associated with extreme violence and severe behavioral dysregulation, many children with this diagnosis will also meet diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder (CD).Taken together, these findings suggest that early onset maniarepresents a highly virulent form of the disorder that is heavily comorbid with disruptive behavior disorders. While the literature has paid little attention to subsyndromal cases, it is very clear that theonset of this disorder in insidious and children with incipientdisorders are likely to be seen in the clinic. Since intervention with incipient cases may be critical to avoid progression and morbidity, there is a critical need for clinician to be able to diagnose thosesubsyndormal cases.Conclusions: Research on pediatric BPD has begun to shift from debating the validity of a diagnosis to understanding its neuro-S74 ACNP 49th Annual Conferencebiological underpinnings and clinical correlates. Despite debate, there is an increasing recognition that a substantial minority of children suffer from an extraordinarily severe form of psychopathology associated with extreme irritability, violence, and incapacitationthat is highly suggestive of mania. Advancements in neurosciences,neurobiology, psychopharmacology, genetics and neuroimaging will undoubtedly help advance the understanding of this complex and crippling disorder. Such advances will shed light on the brain circuitsthat may underlie the spectrum of conditions that comprise pediatricbipolar disorder. References: 1. Geller B, et al.

Arguments Against Including Temperamental Dysregulation Disorder with Dysphoria in DSM-5 Robert Kowatch* Cincinnati Childrens Hospital, Cincinnati, OH Background: There are several strong arguments against including Temper Dysregulation Disorder with Dysphoria (TDD) as an official diagnosis in the DSM-5. Methods: The TDD diagnosis, as currently conceived, does not have symptom criteria that are specific to TDD as a syndrome. The TDD diagnosis rests on two primary criteria: recurrent severe temper outbursts and chronically irritable and/or sad mood. Temper outburstsare a behavioral manifestation of irritable mood, TDD as it is currentlyproposed, can be fulfilled with the presence of a single symptom. However the symptom of irritability is a DSM-IV diagnostic criterion for a range of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents thatspan the Mood, Anxiety and Disruptive Behavior Disorder categoriesincluding Bipolar Disorders, Major Depressive Disorder, Dysthymic Disorder, Cyclothymic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder, Acute Stress Disorder and OppositionalDefiant Disorder. As noted in the DSM-5 Task Force document ''Justification for Temper Dysregulation Disorder with Dysphoria'', the limited scientific support for the TDD diagnosis emerges primarilyfrom one research group. This fact in itself is problematic, asreplication by independent research teams is a requirement for establishing the scientific validity of research findings. Recently in psychiatry we have repeatedly seen the lack of replication of geneticand neuroimaging findings across different research groups. Inaddition the studies that do have bearing on TDD do not examine it directly, but instead focus on an overlapping but not identical population of youth with Severe Mood Dysregulation (SMD). Theproposed TDD criteria will likely identify a broader range of patientswhen applied in clinical settings. Irritability and temper outbursts are among the most common presenting complaints in child andadolescent psychiatry. Since TDD has these as its primary diagnostic criteria without any other accompanying symptoms, it could readily become the default diagnosis for the vast majority of children presenting with these symptoms. The rationale that TDD will reducethe inappropriate use of medication in children and adolescents withtemper outbursts also seems at odds with perceptions of how the pharmaceutical industry approaches the DSM. Official diagnostic status in DSM-5 will allow TDD to become a target for pharmaceuticalcompanies to obtain an FDA indication for the treatment of TDD.Discussion: In summary, the inclusion of Temper Dysregulation Disorder with Dysphoria as a diagnosis in the DSM-5 is not warranted for many reasons. The level of scientific evidence to support TDD istoo limited to justify a new diagnostic entity. Application of the TDDcriteria in clinical practice will most likely label a highly heterogeneous group of children and adolescents who will have divergent develop- mental trajectories of psychopathology. Youth with a broad range ofsymptomatology are lumped together into the TDD diagnostic category, research into the pathophysiology and treatment of youth with severe irritability will be adversely affected - greater heterogeneityreduces the signal to noise ratio. Inclusion of TDD will compromisethe already precarious public perception of child and adolescent psychiatry. Disclosure: R.A. Kowatch, AstraZeneca, Part 5. Non-Episodic Irritability Is Not a Developmental Presentation of Bipolar Disorder Ellen Leibenluft*, Kenneth Towbin, Daniel Pine NIMH, Bethesda, MD Background: Over the last decade, researchers have advanced the idea that bipolar disorder (BD) presents in youth, not with the episodes of mania characteristic of ''classic'' BD, but instead with severe, non-episodic irritability.Methods: To test the hypothesis that mania presents in youth as severe, non-episodic irritability, we embarked on a program of research centered on recruiting youth with unequivocal, episodic BD,as well as youth with ''severe mood dysregulation'' (SMD). The criteriafor SMD were designed to ascertain reliably youth with severe, non- episodic irritability and the ''hyperarousal'' symptoms common to ADHD and the ''B'' criteria of mania. Approximately 150 youth in eachgroup have been compared on longitudinal course and family history, as well as clinical neuroscience measures. The latter included response reversal, face emotion processing, and frustrating paradigms, usedboth behaviorally and in concert with ERP's and/or fMRI. This work inclinical samples was supplemented by post-hoc analyses of commu- nity-based data sets to examine longitudinal outcomes of irritability. Results: Outcome: Over a median follow-up period of 28.4 months, 1/84 SMD (mean 11.6 \u00b12.3y) developed a (hypo)manic episode, whereas 58/ 93 BD (mean 12.9 \u00b12.8y) developed such episodes (p o.001). In a post- hoc analysis of the Great Smoky Mountain Study (N \u00bc1420), the lifetime prevalence of a proxy form of SMD was 3.3%. At 18.3 \u00b12.1 years, youth with SMD at age 10.6 \u00b11.4 years were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a unipolar depressive disorder (p o.02) than youth who never met criteria for SMD. Similarly, a 20-yearfollow-up of the Children in the Community sample (N \u00bc631) found that irritability at age 13.8 \u00b12.6 was associated with dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depression, but not BD, at age 33.2\u00b12.9. Family history: Parents of BD youth N N and SMD youth (proband N \u00bc30, parent N \u00bc37) were interviewed by clinicians blind to the child's diagnostic status. Compared to parents of SMD youth, those of BD youth were more likely to themselves meet criteria for BD (p o.01). Clinical neuro- science: Compared to controls, both youth with SMD and those with BD have deficits in face emotion labeling and response reversal, and experience more frustration when playing a rigged game. However, inS75 ACNP 49th Annual Conferenceeach instance the mediating brain circuitry differs between patient groups. For example, BD show executive attention deficits during frustration, whereas SMD show deficits in early attentional processing regardless of emotional condition. During both explicit and implicitface emotion processing, amygdala activity differs between SMDand BD. Discussion: Longitudinal work in both clinical and epidemiological samples indicates that irritable youth are not at high risk to ''grow up''to develop classic BD. Preliminary family data indicate that youthwith BD are more likely than those with SMD to have a parent with BD. While the two patient groups share several behavioral deficits, the mediating neural circuitry differs between groups. Thus, to theextent that one conceptualizes BD categorically, youth with the SMDphenotype (i.e., severe non-episodic irritability) should not be diagnosed with BD. Ultimately, however, SMD and BD may be found to have some overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms.Disclosure: E. Leibenluft, None. Developmental & Nosological Issues in Defining Pediatric Bipolar Disorder David Shaffer* Columbia Univ and NY State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY Dr. Shaffer will review in detail evidence from a nosological, developmental perspective bearing on the diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder. He will first emphasize the problems inherent inadopting uncritically a set of adult diagnostic labels and appropriatingthem for classification systems in childhood. This has inherent risks when psychopathological phenomena in children show significant differences from those in adults, before a reasonable body of researchdemonstrates strong similarities between the childhood and adult condition. Such research ideally should collect data on the relation- ships, in prospective studies, manifesting among children, adolescents,and adults with the disorder. In the second part of his talk, Dr. Shafferthen will also discuss a similar set of problems that arise when problems in children are given different labels for syndromes that do appear to resemble syndromes that commonly manifest adults.Again, evidence of such similarity emerges from studies examiningexternal validators, particularly the longitudinal outcome of the pediatric condition, and Dr. Shaffer will review the nature of such evidence. For both sets of problems, Dr. Shaffer will use examples fromthe psychiatric literature to illustrate the nature of problems that canarise. Disclosure: D. Shaffer, None. Panel Session Social Cognition and Social Neuroscience in Schizophrenia Social Cognition in Schizophrenia: Stability of Impairments Across Phases of Illness and 12-Month Prediction of Functional Outcome inFirst-Episode Patients William P. Horan* UCLA Semel Institute, Los Angeles, CA Background: Social cognitive impairments in chronic schizophrenia are large in magnitude and are associated with poor outcome. However, little is known about the scope, stability, and functionalcorrelates of social cognitive impairments during the early course ofschizophrenia. In the current study, three different aspects of social cognition required for meaningful social interaction (emotion proces- sing, Theory of Mind, and social/relationship perception) wereevaluated in patients during early to late phases of illness.Methods: Participants included patients in three distinct phases of illness: prodromal (n \u00bc50), first-episode (n \u00bc81), and chronic(n\u00bc54), and three corresponding demographically matched healthy control samples. Measures included the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emo- tional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), the Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT), and the Relationships Across Domains (RAD) test.Cross-sectional analyses compared the matched patient and controlgroups on these three tests. Longitudinal analyses within the first- episode patient sample evaluated whether performance on these tasks was temporally stable and predicted functional outcome across a 12-month follow-up period.Results: Each social cognitive measure revealed clear cross-sectional impairments in prodromal, first-episode, and chronic patients compared to their corresponding control groups. The magnitude ofimpairments on the social cognitive tasks was medium to large andthere was no evidence of progression or improvement across the three patient cohorts. Among first-episode patients, each social cognitive test demonstrated good 12-month longitudinal stability (test-retestr's:.70 -.86). Higher baseline and 12-month social cognition scores were both significantly associated with better real-world outcomes in work functioning, level of independence, and social functioning at follow-up(r's:.34 -.59). Furthermore, cross-lagged panel analyses were consistentwith a causal model in which baseline social cognition drove later functional outcome in the domain of work, above and beyond the contribution of symptoms.Discussion: Wide-ranging social cognitive impairments are present in early schizophrenia and are consistent in magnitude across early to late phases of illness. This fits the pattern of a stable vulnerability marker as opposed to an indicator of severity or chronicity. Socialcognitive impairments also robustly predict real-world functional outcome during the early course of schizophrenia. These impairments therefore appear to be useful targets for early psychosocial andpharmacological interventions to promote functional recovery.Disclosure: W.P. Horan, None. Social Appraisal, Negative Emotion, and Medial Frontal Connectivity in Chronic Psychosis Stephan F. Taylor* University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Background: Social information processing is impaired in schizo- phrenia, in a variety of domains, including the tendency to appraise individuals as threatening or persecutory. Social information proces- sing entails complex emotional operations, and neurocircuits of thebrain involved in emotion overlap considerably with those involved in social function, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which is implicated in schizophrenia. In previous work, we have demonstratedaberrant activity in the mPFC to negatively-valenced stimuli. Here, weused a social appraisal task to elucidate network dysfunction during social appraisal, focusing on negative emotional expressions, which we predicted would engage aberrant mPFC activity and poor connectivity.Methods: Twenty-one stable outpatients with chronic psychotic disorders (16 schizophrenic, 5 schizoaffective) and 21 matched, healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects performed an explicit social appraisal task, in which subjects judgedwhether or not they liked face stimuli (negative, neutral and positive expressions), contrasted with a gender identification task. A psycho- physical interaction (PPI) analysis was conducted to evaluate thedistributed networks that carry out this social cognitive function.Results: For social appraisal, patients were slower to respond, but particularly slow when they judged negatively-valenced faces, com- pared with the control subjects. This slowness correlated positivelywith the amount of negative emotion reported by the patients.Appraisal activated the mPFC across all face valences. For negative faces, the patients exhibited greater activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; -9, 30, 24, Z \u00bc5.07), as well as increased activity in the precuneus. For positive faces, the controls exhibitedgreater activity in the cerebellum. PPI analysis of the dACC revealed co-modulation of the mPFC in controls, significantly less in patientsS76 ACNP 49th Annual Conference(0, 54, 21, Z \u00bc3.96). In controls, coupling of the dACC occurred with fusiform face areas, whereas more diffuse regions of the visual cortex exhibited coupling in the patients. Activation in visual cortex was impaired during the preference task for negative faces, whichcorrelated with poor social adjustment and impaired social cognition.Discussion: Patients with chronic psychosis exhibit aberrant proces- sing of negatively-valenced social stimuli during social appraisal, here involving dysfunction of the mPFC and dACC, such that the normalcoupling of these adjacent regions is disrupted. The social appraisaltask also showed coupling between dACC and visual processing areas, and abnormal activity in early processing in schizophrenia may reflect cortical deficits, correlated with broad functional measures, in linewith data showing that early visual processing is associated withimpaired social functioning in schizophrenia.

Emotion Processing in Schizophrenia: Face and Prosody Ruben Gur*, Raquel Amy Pinkham, James Loughead University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PABackground: Emotion processing deficits in schizophrenia have been extensively documented and linked to abnormal activation of limbicand frontal regions, other deficits in social cognition and to clinical features. However, most studies to date have focused on either facial or vocal emotion identification, and few have examined the interactionbetween these modalities or on quantifying expression deficits. We present recently completed and ongoing work on identification and expression of affect on the face and through prosody in patients withschizophrenia and healthy comparison subjects.Methods: Facial and vocal affect stimuli have been generated using standardized published procedures. The stimuli have been validated and then used in field studies and in fMRI experiments examiningaffect identification. Analysis of fMRI results have incorporated bothevaluation of signal change and psychophysiological interactions (PPI) analysis to examine inter-regional communication. Computerized semi-automated methods for quantifying facial and vocal change havebeen developed more recently, and demonstrated sensitivity toindividual differences in healthy people. We also developed procedures for eliciting emotional expressions in a standardized yet effective fashion. These methods have been applied in tandem to quantifyemotional expression deficits in patients with schizophrenia. Results: Both behavioral deficits in affect identification and abnormal activation to affective stimuli, as well as abnormal connectivitybetween limbic and frontal and striatal regions are evident inschizophrenia. They appear more severe for threat-related emotions (anger, fear) than for affiliative emotions (happy, sad) and seem to reflect deficits in early stages of facial and vocal stimulus processing,which lead to greater reliance on deficient frontal executive functions.The deficits in facial affect processing seem to parallel those in vocal affect identification, although the latter are relatively more severe. Both deficits are associated with more severe neurocognitive impairment,but their correlation with clinical symptomatology appears more specific and modulated by whether the deficit is primarily for threat related or for affiliative emotions. Deficits in expression of affect in face and voice are also evident in schizophrenia, and the application ofclassifiers based on support vector machines (SVM) yields reliablediagnostic assignment. The expression deficits correlate well with clinical ratings of flat and inappropriate affect. Discussion: Advanced behavioral and neuroimaging methodology can help delineate the extent and potential causes of deficits in socialcognition that are core features of schizophrenia. Large samples are needed to ferret out the links between affect identification deficits and clinical features, and these should incorporate paradigms where bothfacial and vocal affect are studied simultaneously. Implementingquantitative methods for analysis of facial and vocal affective expressions could eventually lead to more objective methods of assessing flat affect that could supplement and ultimately replaceclinical ratings as diagnostic tools and as objective yardsticks for gauging treatment effects.

Self vs. Other in Schizophrenia: What Behavioral, Neural, and Cognitive Training Experiments Tell Us About Future Treatment DirectionsSophia Vinogradov* UC San Francisco, San Francisco, CABackground: Behavioral evidence indicates that, for both schizo- phrenia patients and healthy subjects, memory for self-generatedinformation shows unique associations with social cognition, com- pared with memory for externally presented information. In other words, the ability to remember that ''self was source'' on an earliersentence completion task strongly relates to basic social cognitiveperformance on face recognition and emotion identification tasks. However, in schizophrenia, this relationship is attenuated and is also influenced by attention and executive functions. Moreover, in fMRIexperiments, schizophrenia patients show relatively decreased activa-tion within dorsal medial prefrontal cortex compared to healthy subjects when engaged in this process. Methods: Randomized controlled trial of neuroscience-based compu- terized cognitive training and sequential behavioral and fMRI assessments. Results: Eighty hours (sixteen weeks) of intensive computerized cognitive training of general and social cognitive functions results insignificant behavioral improvement in self-referential source memory in schizophrenia, as well as ''normalization'' of the neural correlates of this process observed in fMRI experiments.Discussion: We will discuss the implications of these findings for the design of future behavioral treatments that target social cognition functions in schizophrenia.
