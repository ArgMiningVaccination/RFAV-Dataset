Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a medical system that uses treatments such as acupuncture & herbal medicine to achieve health through balance. For over two thousand years, it has been used to diagnose, treat, and prevent illness. Diagnosis combines health history with examination of the tongue and the pulses. Weaknesses and imbalances of the organs are often at the root cause of illness, and will affect the appearance of the tongue (e.g. cracks, color, coating thickness & color, etc.) and the strength of the pulses. Health comes from balance TCM can be very effective at treating many different kinds of diseases. It enhances the ability to heal, improves immunity, and boosts the capacity for work and creativity. [Dr. Lee, N.D](https://www.naturopathichealth.info/port-coquitlam-naturopathic-doctor/). often combines a variety of treatments, including acupuncture, acupressure, cupping, scraping, and different herbal formulations to support the body's systems and correct imbalanced dynamics between organs. Theories of harmony and balance also guide some dietary & lifestyle recommendations. Energy and blood must be strong and flow freely in order for the body to function optimally; stagnation of Qi (life energy) and blood can cause pain (e.g. headaches, muscle/joint pain, menstrual pain, etc). The different aspects of TCM focus on removing these blockages, strengthening weakened organs, and balancing the interactions between organs to relieve pain and optimize health. Acupuncture treatments Acupuncture itself is the insertion of very fine, sterile acupuncture needles into specific points to move Qi and blood. Insertion of the needles goes unnoticed by some, and to others feels like a small pinch followed by a sensation of tingling, numbness, ache, warmth or heaviness. Needles remain in place for 20-30 minutes, and may be combined with electrical stimulation, cupping, or [Reiki](https://www.naturopathichealth.info/reiki-energy-healing/) to enhance its effect. Dr. Lee only uses disposable needles, which are discarded after one use. Patients often report a strong sensation of relaxation after treatments. **Please note that acupuncture treatments with Dr. Lee, N.D. fall under the category of \"Naturopathic visits\", per most insurance companies.
