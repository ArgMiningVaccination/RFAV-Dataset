Introduction The long term response to the COVID -19 pandemic requires the deployment of a safe and effective vaccine with enough uptake in the 'at risk' and overall population to protect individual patients and redu ce the burden on and risk to NHS services. Rapid progress has been made. UK governments have announced the advanced purchase of four different COVID -19 vaccine technologies, totalling 350 million doses, including the Moderna Vaccine , developed by the Unite d States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, Moderna. Planning for delivery is exceptionally challenging due t o the emerging nature of data on vaccine characteristics and of developing understanding of which individuals are most at risk of severe COVID -19 infection. The overall Wales Programme COVID -19 Vaccination strategic intent is to immunise as many eligible i ndividuals, as swiftly as possible, safely with minimum waste. Primary Care in Wales has an excellent track record of delivering immunisation programmes, and has the skilled and experienced workforce necessary to deliver a COVID -19 vaccination programme. Successful delivery will require significant resources to deliver a mass vaccination programme with additional workforce, venues, logistics and data management solutions to ensure safe and timely vaccine deployment. This Primary Care COVID -19 Immunisati on Scheme Specification specifically relates to the delivery of the Moderna Vaccine by Primary Care providers, defined for the purpose of this specification as \"engaged providers\". 2. Background SARS -CoV-2 virus is the official name of the strain of corona virus that causes the disease known as COVID -19. When a human is exposed to the SARS -CoV-2 virus, spike glycoprotein (S) found on the surface of the virus binds to ACE2 receptors on human cells to gain entry to the cells and cause an infection. Early vacci nes act by boosting the ability of the body to recognise and develop an immune response to the spike protein, and this will help stop the SARS -CoV-2 virus from entering human cells and therefore prevent infection. Vaccinating people against the SARS -CoV-2 virus is key to reducing the severe morbidity and mortality it causes and providing a long term solution to controlling the current COVID -19 pandemic. When safe and effective vaccines against COVID -19 are available it is essential that they are delivered quickly to those who need it. March 2021 10 The Moderna Covid -19 vaccine is a nucleoside -modified messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine. mRNA vaccines use the pathogen's genetic code as the vaccine; this then exploits the host cells to translate the code then make the target spike protein. The protein then acts as an intracellular antigen to stimulate the immune response. mRNA is then normally degraded within a few days. The Moderna vaccine has been generated entirely in vitro and is formulated in lipid nanoparticles which are taken up by the host cells. Moderna vaccine is expected to be available from April 2021. Vaccine supply to Wales is being managed centrally by Welsh Government in conjunction with Local Health Boards. Engaged providers who participate in this Primary Ca re COVID -19 Immunisation Scheme will not be required to purchase any stock of the vaccine. Supplies of the Moderna Vaccine will be delivered in limited quantities over several months and so care must be taken to ensure that the most vulnerable have adequat e access before the general population. All vaccines will be free and mandatory vaccination is not planned. Private supplies of vaccine will not be available. A Patient Group Direction for administering COVID -19 vaccines has been authorised by each Local Health Board. The Human Medicines (Coronavirus and Influenza) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1125/pdfs/uksi_20201125_en.pdf ) also allow COVID -19 vaccines to be administered according to a two -step national protocol using registered trained and competent health care professionals to carry out the clinical assessment, consent and preparation steps of delivery, whilst suitably trained, non -registered and competent members of staff will be able to administer the vaccine itself under clinical supervision by a registered health care professional. The Human Medicines Regulations do not specify who these non -registered vaccinators might be. This will be covered in a national protocol. Those persons engaged in delivery of this PCCIS will be covered by existing indemnity arrangements pursuant to regulation 8 of the NHS (Clinical Negligence Scheme) (Wales) Regulations 2019. 3. Primary Care CO VID-19 Immunisation Scheme Aims This Primary Care COVID -19 Immunisation Scheme (\"PCCIS\") provides a mechanism for Primary Care providers to enter into an arrangement with their Local Health Board (\"the relevant Local Health Board\") to enable the provision of services to administer the Moderna Vaccine as part of the health service in Wales and the wider COVID -19 vaccination programme led by Local Health Boards. 4. Cluster Working Engaged providers are strongly encouraged to work collectively within cluster groupings, whether or not these have previously been in place and irrespective of which primary care services a provider usually provides, to maximise the level of vaccine delivery. For example, for a general medical practitioner this may mean March 2021 11 administering vaccinations to people who are not registered with the provider administering the vaccine, whilst for other providers, it could also mean administering vaccines at venues away from their normal working location. 5. Eligible Cohorts for Vaccination under the Primary Care COVID -19 Immunisation Scheme The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advises UK health departments on immunisation and will determine eligibility for specific COVID -19 vaccines. However, prioritisation amongst the eligible groups will depend on vaccine characteristics and advice from the JCVI. This means that the use of the Moderna Vaccine needs to be considered as part of the wider COVID -19 vaccination programme, where multiple vaccines and multiple models of delivery are in use. The current JCVI priority groups are listed in Appendix A. Consequently, this PCCIS only relates to those specific eligible groups as determined by the contracting Local Health Board based on the JCVI advice . Engaged providers who participate in t his PCCIS should ensure all of their staff are aware of which groups are eligible for vaccination under this PCCIS and the prioritised sequence for delivery. Vaccination outside of these specific eligible groups will not receive payments under this PCCIS. For full details of vaccination against COVID -19, health care practitioners should refer to the relevant chapters of the Green Book \"Immunisation against infectious disease\" (www.gov.uk) . 6. Conditions for Service Delivery In order for a primary care provider to be considered for participation in this PCCIS, all of the following conditions must be met: a. There must be an up -to-date and appropriate level of equipment for resuscitation and anaphylaxis, specifically adrenaline, at any site where vaccination occurs. b. All persons who are involved in administration of vaccinations must be; i. adequately trained in administration of mu lti-dose vaccinations, vaccine storage, handling, security and assessment and management of resuscitation, anaphylaxis and aseptic no -touch techniques , and ii. trained in the use of PPE, be supplied with and wear the appropriate PPE for the setting in which t hey are working. c. All venues where vaccination occurs must have been risk -assessed for transmission of coronavirus, based on local guidance, and action taken to reduce risk where possible. d. Patients, who for the purposes of this Specification shall be define d March 2021 12 to mean a person who will be or has been administered the vaccine under this PCCIS, should be advised in advance not to attend if feeling unwell. Nonetheless, some patients may present to the vaccination location unwell, or may become unwell whilst atten ding the vaccination location. Facilities must be in place for the assessment and management of patients who are unwell and this must include resources to manage fainting and anaphylaxis/cardiac arrest to a primary care level of skill. Reliance on 999 Para medics is not appropriate. e. The engaged provider and any person involved in the administration of a COVID -19 vaccine must have undertaken an appropriate training programme specific to the vaccine being used. Public Health Wales has provided an e -learning mo dule: https://www.e - lfh.org.uk/programmes/covid -19-vaccination/ f. Primary care providers are encouraged to collaborate with other primary care providers within existing clusters but a lso, where necessary, to form new clusters specifically to deliver this PCCIS, which can be with providers outside of their own profession, if they have not already done so. g. A clinical record of immunisation with a COVID -19 vaccine must be entered onto the Welsh Immunisation System (WIS). Arrangements are being made at UK level with GP system providers for the Welsh Immunisation System (and NHSE NIMS) to populate patient records automatically, to avoid double entry. 7. Payment for administration of the COVI D-19 mRNA Vaccine Moderna (\"the vaccine\") under this PCCIS a. The Local Health Board must pay to an engaged provider who qualifies for the payment in accordance with paragraphs 7.b. to p., a payment of \u2014 i. \u00a312.58 in respect of each dose of the vaccine administe red to a person under this PCCIS, and ii. \u00a3400 for every 1,000 vaccines administered under this PCCIS. Eligibility for payment b. A dentist, general medical practitioner, optician or pharmacist is only eligible for a payment for provision of services under this PCCIS in circumstances where the following conditions are met \u2014 i. they are an engaged provider, ii. the person in respect of whom the payment is claimed was allocated to the engaged provider by the relevant Local Health Board with whom the engaged provider h as an agreement to provide services under this PCCIS, iii. all required details have been entered on to the Welsh Immunisation System to create a clinical record of immunisation with the vaccine for each person in respect of whom a payment is being claimed by t he engaged provider, iv. the engaged provider does not receive any payment from any March 2021 13 other source in respect of the vaccine (if the engaged provider does receive payments from other sources in respect of any person, the Local Health Board must consider whether to recover any payment made under this PCCIS in respect of that person pursuant to sub -paragraphs 7.j. and k. (overpayments and withheld amounts), and v. the engaged provider creates the clinical record on the Welsh Immunisation System at point of administrat ion of each dose. c. An engaged provider is not entitled to receive payment of more than \u00a325.16 in respect of any one person under this PCCIS. Payment d. The engaged provider will receive an automatic payment based on information recorded on the Welsh Immuni sation System in respect of each person who has received a vaccine and, where applicable, for every 1,000 vaccines administered under this PCCIS, and the activity of the engaged provider will be captured by NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership as at the t enth day of each calendar month. e. Any amount payable in accordance with sub -paragraph d. falls due following the expiry of 14 days after the activity is captured under sub-paragraph d.; i. in the case of a GDS contractor, on the next date when the GDS contrac tor's payable monthly Annual Contract Value Payment falls due in accordance with the relevant GDS Statement of Financial Entitlements; ii. in the case of a GMS contractor, on the next date when the GMS contractor's Global Sum monthly payment falls due in accor dance with the relevant Statement of Financial Entitlements; iii. in the case of a GOS contractor, on the date in the next month when the GOS contractor's General Ophthalmic Services monthly reimbursement falls due in accordance with the Statement of Remunerati on; iv. in the case of a pharmacist, on the next date when the pharmacist receives any other payments due under the Drug Tariff, and v. in the case of any other engaged provider, no later than 8 weeks beginning with the date on which the engaged provider creates or updates the clinical record on the Welsh Immunisation System, or as otherwise may be agreed between the Local Health Board and the engaged provider. f. The Local Health Board must ensure that the receipt and payment in respect of any automatic payments m ade pursuant to sub -paragraph d. are properly recorded and that each such payment has a clear audit trail. March 2021 14 Conditions attached to payment g. A payment under the provisions of this PCCIS is only payable if an engaged provider satisfies the following conditi ons; i. in respect of each person for which a payment under this PCCIS is claimed, the engaged provider has supplied the relevant Local Health Board, via the Welsh Immunisation System, with; a) the name of the person, b) the date of birth of the person, c) the NHS num ber, where known, of the person, d) the date each dose of the vaccine is administered. h. The relevant Local Health Board may request from an engaged provider any information which the Local Health Board does not have but needs, and the engaged provider either has or could be reasonably expected to obtain, in order for the Local Health Board to form an opinion on whether the engaged provider is eligible for payment under the provisions of this PCCIS. i. The relevant Local Health Board may, in appropriate circumst ances, withhold payment of any, or any part of, payments due under this PCCIS if an engaged provider breaches any of these conditions. Overpayments and withheld amounts j. If the relevant Local Health Board makes a payment to an engaged provider pursuant to this PCCIS and; i. the engaged provider was not entitled to receive all or part thereof, whether because it did not meet the entitlement conditions for the payment or because the payment was calculated incorrectly (including where a payment on account overes timates the amount that is to fall due); ii. the Local Health Board was entitled to withhold all or part of the payment because of a breach of a condition attached to the payment, but is unable to do so because the money has already been paid; or iii. the Local Hea lth Board is entitled to repayment of all or part of the money paid, the Local Health Board may recover the money paid by deducting an equivalent amount from any payment payable under this PCCIS, and where no such deduction can be made, it is a condition o f the payments made pursuant to this PCCIS that the engaged provider must pay to the Local Health Board that equivalent amount. k. Where the relevant Local Health Board is entitled pursuant to sub - paragraph j. to withhold all or part of a payment because of a breach of a payment condition, and the Local Health Board does so or recovers the money by deducting an equivalent amount from another payment made in accordance with sub -paragraph b., it may, where it sees fit to do so, reimburse the engaged provider th e amount March 2021 15 withheld or recovered, if the breach is cured. Underpayments and late payments l. If the full amount of a payment that is payable under this PCCIS has not been paid before the date on which the payment falls due, then unless; i. this is with the conse nt of the engaged provider, or ii. the amount of, or entitlement to, the payment, or any part thereof, is in dispute, once it falls due, it must be paid promptly. m. If the engaged provider's entitlement to the payment is not in dispute but the amount of the pay ment is in dispute, then once the payment falls due, pending the resolution of the dispute, the relevant Local Health Board must; i. pay to the engaged provider, promptly, an amount representing the amount that the Local Health Board accepts that the engaged provider is at least entitled to, and ii. thereafter pay any shortfall promptly, once the dispute is finally resolved. n. However, if an engaged provider has; i. not claimed a payment to which it would be entitled under this PCCIS if it claimed the payment, or ii. claimed a payment to which it is entitled under this PCCIS but a Local Health Board is unable to calculate the payment until after the payment is due to fall due because it does not have the information it needs in order to calculate that payment (all reasonab le efforts to obtain the information having been undertaken), that payment is (instead) to fall due on the first working day of the month after the month during which the Local Health Board obtains the information it needs in order to calculate the paymen t. Payments on account o. Where the relevant Local Health Board and the engaged provider agree (but the Local Health Board's agreement may be withdrawn where it is reasonable to do so and if it has given the engaged provider reasonable notice thereof), th e Local Health Board must pay to an engaged provider on account any amount that is; i. the amount of, or a reasonable approximation of the amount of, a payment that is due to fall due under this PCCIS; or ii. an agreed percentage of the amount of, or a reasonable approximation of the amount of, a payment that is due to fall due under this PCCIS, and if that payment results in an overpayment in respect of the payment, sub -paragraphs 7.j. and k. apply. March 2021 16 Post payment verification p. Post payment verification( 12) applie s to the provision of services under this PCCIS. 8. PCCIS Specification Agreement of Eligible Cohorts a. The relevant Local Health Board will develop a proactive and preventative approach to offering the Moderna Vaccine by adopting robust call and reminder s ystems to contact individuals within eligible cohorts, with the aims of; i. maximising uptake in the interests of those persons, and ii. meeting any public health targets in respect of the administration of the Moderna Vaccine. b. The engaged provider must agree wi th the relevant Local Health Board to; i. participate in this PCCIS to maximise the vaccination of specific cohorts of the population with the Moderna Vaccine listed in or notified by the Welsh Ministers in accordance with Appendix A; ii. accept the order of the cohorts and timescale over which the vaccines will be administered; and iii. in the case of general medical practitioners, vaccinate appropriate people who are not registered with their practice. Publicity & Promotion c. The engaged provider must prominently dis play provided materials advertising the availability of the Moderna vaccinations for eligible groups. This should include displaying advertisements on the premises website, using social media as well as inside the premises. d. Booking of the first appointmen ts for vaccination and any appointments for second vaccinations, will be according to local policy set by the Health Board and the Welsh Immunisation System will be used. Model for Delivery e. The engaged provider and relevant Local Health Board must agree the timing and location of the vaccination clinic sessions. f. The engaged provider is actively encouraged to work collaboratively with other engaged providers in a cluster to share resources and maximise efficiencies to deliver this PCCIS.

Engaged providers must ensure that: i. the correct dosage of the vaccine is administered, as clinically appropriate; ii. they comply with relevant guidance issued by the JCVI on, including but not limited to: a) which vaccine is the most suitable for each cohort of people; b) the relevant maximum and minimum intervals (as applicable) for administration of each vaccination; c) the rel evant vaccination time limitations and expiry date following reconstitution; d) the number of doses of each vaccine required to achieve the desired immune response; and e) any other relevant guidance relating to the administration of the different types of vacc ine and the different cohorts from time to time. March 2021 18 Persons involved in administering the vaccine n. The engaged provider must ensure that vaccinations are administered only by a person permitted to do so in accordance with the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 , as amended by the Human Medicines (Coronavirus and Influenza) (Amendment) Regulations 2020, including under a relevant Patient Group Direction or under a National Protocol approved by Welsh Ministers. o. All health care professionals administering the vacc ine, must have: i. read and understood the clinical guidance available at http://nww.immunisation.wales.nhs.uk/covid -19-vaccination -programme ii. completed the additional onlin e COVID -19 specific training modules available on the e -learning for health website when available. Engaged providers will be expected to oversee and keep a record to confirm that all persons administering the vaccines have undertaken the training prior to participating in vaccinations; iii. the necessary experience, skills, training and competency to administer vaccines in general, including completion of the general immunisation training available on e -learning for health and face -to- face administration trai ning, where relevant; iv. the necessary experience, skills, training and competency to administer vaccines in general, including training with regard to the recognition and initial treatment of anaphylaxis; and v. ensured that registered health care professiona ls were involved in the preparation (in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions) of the vaccine(s) unless unregistered staff have been trained to do this. p. All other persons administering the vaccine must: i. be authorised, listed, referred to or ot herwise identified by reference to the Human Medicines (Coronavirus and Influenza) (Amendment) Regulations 2020, including under a relevant Patient Group Direction or National Protocol approved by Welsh Ministers; ii. while preparing and/or administering vacc inations be supervised by a health care professional fulfilling the requirements of sub -paragraph o., above; iii. have completed the additional online COVID -19 specific training modules available on the e -learning for health website when available. Engaged pr oviders must oversee and keep a record to confirm that all staff have undertaken the training prior to participating in administration of the vaccination. This includes any additional training associated with new vaccines that become available while this P CCIS is in operation; iv. have the necessary skills and training to administer vaccines in general, including completion of the general immunisation training available on e -learning for health and face -to-face administration training, where relevant; and v. the necessary skills and training, including training with regard to the recognition and initial treatment of anaphylaxis. q. Engaged providers must ensure that all vaccines are received, stored, prepared and subsequently transported (where appropriate) in March 2021 19 accor dance with the relevant manufacturer's, Public Health Wales and Local Health Board instructions and all associated Standard Operating Procedures, including that all refrigerators in which vaccines are stored have a maximum/minimum thermometer and that the readings are taken and recorded from that thermometer on all working days and that appropriate action is taken when readings are outside the recommended temperature. Appropriate procedures must be in place to ensure stock rotation, monitoring of expiry dat es and appropriate use of multi -dose vials to ensure that wastage is minimised and does not exceed 5% of the total number of vaccines supplied. Wastage levels will be reviewed by the relevant Local Health Board on an ongoing basis. Where wastage exceeds 5% of the vaccines supplied and that wastage is as a result of supply chain or relevant Local Health Board fault, those vaccines shall be removed from any wastage calculations when reviewed by the relevant LHB on an ongoing basis. r. Engaged providers must ensure that services are accessible, appropriate and sensitive to the needs of all persons. No person allocated by a relevant Local Health Board shall be excluded or experience particular difficulty in accessing and effectively using this PCCIS due to a pr otected characteristic, as outlined in the Equality Act (2010) - this includes Age, Disability, Gender Reassignment, Marriage and Civil Partnership, Pregnancy and Maternity, Race, Religion or Belief, Sex or Sexual Orientation. Record -keeping s. The engaged provider must use the Welsh Immunisation System; i. for recording consent for vaccination, ii. for noting any contraindications, iii. for recording when a vaccination has been given, including the batch number and expiry date, iv. for recording immediate adverse events, v. for providing evidence for payments under this PCCIS, including for Post Payment Verification. t. By using the Welsh Immunisation System, the record of vaccination of a person by the engaged provider will be sent electronically to the individual's GMS reco rd. u. The engaged provider must; i. supply Public Health Wales with information on persons who have received the vaccine, via the Welsh Immunisation System, for the purpose of monitoring local and national uptake; ii. supply NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership with information on persons who have received the vaccine, via the Welsh Immunisation System for the purposes of payment, and/or post payment verification; iii. provide data, to the cluster lead practice of a cluster (where applicable), Local Health Boards and Welsh Government when March 2021 20 required; and iv. ensure consistent coding for capture of data and compliance with relevant information governance legislation. Adverse Events v. All adverse events relating to the vaccine must be reported to; i. the MHRA using the Yellow Ca rd scheme www.yellowcard.gov.uk , and ii. the Health Board Primary Care Team (by using DATIX or the all Wales Concerns Management System, or existing local arrangements). w. Although no data for co -administration of COVID -19 vaccine with other vaccines exists, in the absence of such data, first principles would suggest that interference between inactivated vaccines with different antigenic content is likely to be limited. Whilst there is no evidence of any safety concerns, the Moderna Vaccine should not be routinely offered at the same time as other vaccines. Engaged providers should refer to the available guidance which can currently be found here. x. The engaged provider must ensure the person receiving the Moderna Vaccine has understood that failure to receive all r ecommended doses of the vaccine may render the vaccination ineffective and should ensure that a follow up appointment to receive the subsequent dose has been booked, acknowledging that in exceptional circumstances appointments may need to be moved, before administering the first dose of the vaccine. Vaccine stock and consumables y. The relevant Local Health Board will; i. coordinate vaccine supplies; and ii. provide consumables such as PPE, syringes and needles. Publicity and Information Materials z. Publicity m aterials and information leaflets will be provided by the relevant Local Health Board. Security aa. The security assessment related to delivery of the vaccine is continually evolving. In order to ensure the safety of patients, staff and the vaccine itself, e ngaged providers must have robust security measures in place. bb. At this moment, as a minimum this must include: i. lockable temperature controlled storage (vaccine fridge). This can include adaptation of an existing fridge; ii. lockable internal doors preventing access to vaccine storage by unauthorised persons; iii. lockable external windows and doors; March 2021 21 iv. an operational intruder alarm, preferably linked to an Alarm Receiving Centre; and v. a robust and operational security process which all staff are aware of and are comp liant with. cc. All packaging relating to the vaccine must be destroyed or defaced in such a manner that prevents it being reused for any purpose. This includes the safe and secure disposal of empty vials to ensure they cannot be reused. dd. Additional securi ty measures that should also be considered but are desirable, include: i. operational external CCTV covering all entry points; ii. external Lighting; and iii. operational internal CCTV covering the location of the vaccine storage. ee. Due to the continually changing na ture of the COVID -19 pandemic and the resources and vaccines that the NHS is able to deploy, these security arrangements must be responsive and may be frequently updated as necessary, dictated by any changes in the threat assessment. Engaged providers are expected to be alive to this issue and committed to providing the best possible PCCIS. 9. Notice Period a. Notice period for ending the agreement for service provision will be four weeks for the relevant Local Health Board and the engaged provider, unless va ried by mutual agreement between the Local Health Board and engaged provider. Notice must be given in writing setting out detailed reasons. b.
