Clinical Nutrition by Lexi Lexi Sandifer FNTP. About Me My journey in natural health actually started with my father, Dr. Raymond Davidson. My dad was ahead of his time when it came to natural health care. He graduated from Palmer College of Chiropractic in 1952. He believed in allowing the body to heal itself, when you gave it the right tools. That's how I learned about the importance of eating a healthy diet that is rich in fresh vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, and proteins. In my early 40's I was diagnosed with Lyme's Disease. I was not bit by a tick, but a spider that carried the bacteria. It took 5 years to recover from this highly debilitating disease. I did it with the use of a clean diet, whole food supplements, herbs, and homeopathy. I have had PCOS, 4 miscarriages, fibroids, severe acne, clinical depression, pre-eclampsia, weight issues, the loss of my gallbladder, thyroid issues, cystic breasts, and now that I am over 50...menopause! I have a highly sensitive body so I can't take drugs. I have managed all of my health care through the use of a clean diet, whole food supplements, herbs and homeopathy. True health can be achieved! I'm proof! Testimonies \"I am a newbie with Lexi...And would just want to say, I, too am so impressed with the insight, knowledge and genuine compassion she emulates.
