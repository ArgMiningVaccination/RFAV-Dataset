Hundreds of talks and interviews were given to civic groups and the media. Scientific articles were published in quality, peer-reviewed journals and Experiment St ation Bulletins. The reduction of pesticide use on farms and homeowners' properties remains a high priority. Research on specialty crops, grapes, mosquitoes, encephalitis viruses, deer, invasive plants , plant pathogens, insect pests, ticks and the disease organisms they transmit, soil health, and on trees ha ve progressed. Chemists found unwanted chemicals in milk, imported toothpaste and to ys, and other commercial products. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Sta tion Research Foundation was established to create opportunities for scientists to apply for corporate foun dation grants. The first grant received in this system was awarded by The Propane Education and Research Council to investigate the control of Japanese barberry in forest settings. Early work revealed that in or near thickets of this invasive plant, tick populations were high. The removal of Japan ese barberry might significantly reduce the number of black-legged ticks, Ixodes scapularis . Webster Bank contributed funds to help facilitate the transfer of vegetables and fruits from our experimental farms to food banks and other charities. During the spring of 2008, the former state nursery in Griswold and Voluntown was transferred from the Department of Environmental Protection to the Experiment Station. This property, which consists of about 14 acres of cultivated land plus a small woodland area, will be used to conduct field and laboratory experiments on mosquito es, encephalitis viruses, invasive aquatic plants, grapes, chestnut trees, crops for biodiesel fuel, and control of insect pests and plant pathogens.

Magnarelli, Director, welc omed visitors to Plant Science Day 2007. Each year, the Connecticut Agricultural Inform ation Council presents the Century Farm Award at Plant Science Day. The Century Farm Award, which is given out to a farm that has been in family operation for more than 100 years, was given to Mapleleaf Farm, in He bron, Connecticut. The Fa rm is owned and managed by Ned Ellis, whose family has been farming since the mid-1700's. During the early years, farming included raisi ng chickens, vegetables, fruit, and dairy cows. Today, dairy production is the main focus and include s a herd of 400 Holstein cows, 210 of which are milking cows averaging a yield of 67 pounds per day. To control costs, as much feed as possible is raised by growing hay and corn on about 410 acres of land. Pumpkins are grown on the farm. This activity attracts customers to the property and provides an opportunity to educate the public about farming. Tours are given of a working dairy farm, and special efforts are made to organize field trips for school children. Ned and his wife Renee are proponents of open space and farmland preservation. They sold the development rights for 240 acres in 2003. An additiona l parcel of 170 acres, which the family previously leased, was purchased and put into farmland preservation by another family. Ned Ellis is active in farming organizations. He is a member of Very Alive and Agrimark, a delegate of the Northeast Dairy Promotion Board, a nd one of six founding members of \"The Farmer's Cow\", which is milk produced locally and sold throughout the state. Mr. Ellis was presented a bronze plaque and a certificate signed by Governor M. Jodi Rell. After the Century Farm Award was presented, Dr. Magnarelli introduced F. Philip Prelli, Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Ag riculture, who gave the Samuel W. Johnson lecture entitled \"Connecticut Agriculture - The Local Flavor\". After his talk, Dr. Magnarelli presented Mr. Prelli with a certificate signed by Governor M. Jodi Rell, President of the Board of Control, Leon Zapadka, Secretary of the Board, and himself as Director. Upon completion of the Samuel W. Johnson Lect ure, Dr. Magnarelli introduced Edmund Tucker, President of The Experiment Station Associates, who gave a few remarks and invited people to join the organization. The entire staff of the Station, Professional, T echnical, Clerical, Administrative, Maintenance, and Farm Staff all worked very hard and made an enjoyable, informative Pl ant Science Day possible. 16 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 EVENTS HELD AT THE STATION SEMINARS On August 27, 2007, Dr. Botond Balogh, Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Florida in Gainesville, presented the seminar \"Bacteriophages fo r Plant Disease Control\" in Jones Auditorium.

In 2005 she set up 10 and repaired 2 existing Bluebird nest boxes at Lockwood Farm. That year there were 21 successful fledglings. In 2007, only 13 fl edglings survived due to increased predation, even though the number of boxes was increased to 16. Ms. K aczenski has registered the bluebird trail with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. At the end of the nestin g season, her observations on number of nests, clutch size, number of hatchlings, and adu lt activity will be reported to the Corn ell lab to help with research of the Eastern Bluebird. She has also expanded the tra il to the Valley Lab where Jane Canepa-Morrison will be helping with the observations. STATION OUT OF STATE The Big E On September 26 and 27 the Station hosted a booth in the Connecticut Building at the Big E in Massachusetts. The attendance for those two days was 42,216 and 35,001 respectively. The Station's exhibit consisted of poster displays on Sudden Wetland Dieback and Inv asive Aquatic Plants. Along with Station brochures and publications, the booth had a live honey bee display, and apple slices from apples grown at Lockwood Farm were offered to visitors. Staff participants were Ira Kettle, Gale Ridge, Vickie Bomba-Lewandoski, Tia Blevins, Rose Bonito, Li sa Kaczenski, Roslyn and Rose Hiskes.

The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 19 SPECIAL MILESTONES Two Staff Members Reach 50th Anniversaries at the Station Dr. John Ahrens started his career with the Station on August 1, 1957. Even though he officially retired in 1993, he continues to work steadily at the Va lley Laboratory and has published many research papers. On June 28, 1957 Dr. David Hill joined the staff at the Station. He started out as a researcher working on the State Soil Survey at the Valley Lab. He even tually came to New Haven and worked at Lockwood Farm where he did studies on soil amendments and gr owing new crops in Connecticut. He has studied more than 35 fruits and vegetables, many of which ar e now grown in Connecticut. Even though Dr. Hill is officially retired, he still is at Lockwood Fa rm every day working on growing and researching new crops. He still talks with visitors at the farm and continues to show as much enthusiasm for his work as he did 50 years ago. Two Staff Members Awarded Ph.D. Degrees In April of 2008 two staff members successfully defe nded their dissertations to receive Ph.D. degrees.

The New Haven Register of September 2, 2007 carri ed the Associated Press article \"Determined state gardeners on a mission to wipe out weed\". Mile a Minute vine has begun to take over in the northeast part of the state, moving as far south as Greenwich. A gardening group is determined to eradicate it. Dr. Todd Mervosh wa s interviewed for the arti cle stating that since the vine is new to the area it is hard to determ ine what methods can be used to stop its growth and kill it. The gardeners have formed a group th at goes to areas where th e vine is and pulls it out of the ground and then destroys it. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 23 The Hartford Courant of September 3, 2007 carried the article \"Barnum's Tree A Type Not Born Every Minute\" by Steve Grant. Twelve year old Tim Pelletier researched exotic trees growing on his family's property and discovered a very rare chestnut tree. Dr. Sandra Anagnostakis identified it as a Parsons Japan chestnut, one of only 3 known to be growing in the state. The tree is of the type Dr. Anagnostakis uses in her research to try to repopu late American forests with American chestnut trees. The Parsons Japan ch estnut is immune to the blight that killed all the American chestnuts, is winter hardy and rot resistant. Dr. Anagnosta kis said the new tree will be a valuable part of her research. The New York Times of October 31, 2007 carried th e article \"Parents Ra ising Concerns Over Synthetic Turf\" by Jeff Holtz. As more playing fiel ds made out of recycled tire crumbs are being installed at schools, parents of the children playing on the fiel ds, and several environmental groups and the medical community, are raising concerns over the impact of playing on the fields to the players and the environment. The Experi ment Station did preliminary testing that found several types of gasses emitted from the artificial turf, one of them a possible carcinogen. The state's Attorney General, Richard Blumenth al, requested $200,000 so that the Station can research the issue further. The New London Day of November 1, 2007 carried the article \"Agricultural agency may build in Griswold\" by Megan Bard. The article reported on the transfer of property from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection to the Experiment Stati on.

The article covered a controversy over the use of tire 'crumbs' in the la ying down of sports fields a nd playgrounds at area schools. Environmentalists and the public are concerned about potentia lly hazardous and carcinogenic chemicals that are contained in the tire 'cru mbs'. The article stated \"The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven analyzed rubber crumbs and the chemicals they leach, finding benzothiazole, butylated hydroxya nisole, hexadecane, cadmium. Dr. MaryJane Mattina, Chief of Analytical Chemistry at the Station, said \"laboratory tests are informativ e but cannot reveal how the rubber granules will perform in the field. \"More work is appropriate\" she said\". The New Haven Register of November 11, 2007 car ried the article \"Nat ural Resources Funding Shortage Could Stall Biofuels Re search\" by Luther Turmelle. The article reported that research going on at the Station on biofuels is in danger of having to stop because of lack of state funding. Dr. MaryJane Mattina stated that she saw funding fo r the research, a million dollars over 2 years, disappear suddenly during the last legislative session. The funding was originally included in a state Senate bill, but disappeared in early June. Without the funding of the project the research will need to be stopped in two year s when money runs out. The Sta tion is already in need of new state-of-the-art equipment to catch up to resear ch being done in other st ates. Connecticut lags behind in the biofuels research field. 24 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 The New Haven Register of February 27, 2008 carried the article \"H azardous ground-up tires don't belong on city sidewalks\" by Nancy Al derman. Ground up tire crumbs have become popular in the building of playground s and artificial turf for sports fields. Recent tests done at the Experiment Station show that the crumbs contain many chemicals and carcinogens that can be harmful to children and athletes using the sp orts fields, and the chemicals can leach off and kill trees and plants as well. A recent suggestion was made to use the crumbs in city sidewalks. It is feared that the crumbs (which can heat up to a temperature of 160 degrees or more in spring and summer) would kill trees and plants growing along the sidewalk s, be too hot to walk on and would raise the heat index in the city during hot weather. The arti cle calls for stricter control on how the crumbs are used if at all. The Newsletter of the Bonsai Society of Great er New Haven for Spring, 2008 had a description of Dr. Clair Rutledge's talk to th eir Society. It stated she gave a \"very informative\" talk about the many bugs that affect bonsai. She also ga ve a slide show and pa ssed around specimens of different insects. Sanctuary, Newsletter of the White Memorial C onservation Center, Spri ng issue, carried the article \"Invasive Aquatic Plants and Plant Species Diversity\" by John P. Roche.

Studies were made of 103 lakes throughout Connecticut. The Hartford Courant of March 23, 2008 carried the article \"Taking Aim At Lyme Disease\" by Peter Knight. The article discusses eradicating Ly me disease by destroying most of the deer in the State of Connecticut. The article stated that most of the research on Lyme disease and its possible control was done at the Experiment St ation and that the only way to bring the tick population under control is to get ri d of most of the deer - it is thought that only 10 deer per mile should be left. Some groups are in disagreement with the theory. The Hartford Courant of March 30, 2008 carried the article \"Garden Fever Spreading\" by Steve Grant. The planting of home and community ga rdens is on the rise due to rising fresh produce prices. Requests for information on gardening ma de to Station personnel has increased also. To fill the requests for information, two Station sc ientists are working on fact sheets on starting home gardens that will be available to the pub lic. Dr. Louis Magnarell i said the increased interest in gardening serves nicely as a way to teach children how to grow plants and draw attention to the importance of a nutritious diet. The Guilford Courier of April 10, 2008 carried th e article \"What's the St ory with These Black Bear Cubs? By Fay Abrahamsson. The article reported on a DEP program to track black bears in the state. Dr. Scott Williams was along on a DEP expedition where a female bear was immobilized in order to change her collar and get her vi tal statistics. He had the opportunity to hold her two cubs who were with her. Both cubs were measured and tagged. The New Haven Register of April 29, 2008 carried the article \"DeLauro asks EPA study on fake turf\" by Abram Katz. A news conference was he ld at the Station on April 28 at which US The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 25 Representative Rosa DeLauro, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and others demanded that the federal EPA initiate a study of synthetic athletic fields to test them for harmful materials that may be released into the environment and hurt thos e playing on them. The fields, partially made up of tire crumbs, are being installed across the state and the nati on. The Station did a preliminary study of the \"tire crumbs\" in 2007 an did identify some harmful chemicals present in the crumbs that could possible cause health and environmental problems. The New Haven Register of May 16, 2008 carried th e article \"They're here , and they're hungry: Disease-carrying blacklegged p eak in June, July\" by Abram Katz. The article reported that ticks were being found in large num bers and June, July and into August was prime tick season. The article describe d how ticks transmit spirochetes to cause Lyme disease. Dr. Kirby Stafford gave advice on how to cut dow n the number of ticks on homeowners' property and how removing them quickly will prevent the sp irochetes that cause Lyme disease from being transmitted to the person who was bitten. He st ated \"Inspect your children, your partner and yourself for ticks. If you find one within 24-48 ho urs, it probably has not had time to attach. After 48 hours, there is a 12 percent chance that an infected tick has infected its host. After the tick is attached for 72 hours, the odds of infection soar to 75 percent.\" The Hartford Courant of May 17, 2008 carried a paragraph in the \"G arden Spot\" section \"Getting Down to Earth\" by Steve Grant. The paragraph gave information on how to get soil tested at the Station and how to start a home garden. The Hartford Courant of May 17, 2008 carried th e article \"Sports Field Worries: Harzardous Turf\" by Regine Labossiere and Paul Doyle. The article described the controversy over the safety of new sports fields being installed with \"tire crumb\" bases. The controversy is over the chemicals contained in the \"crumbs\" and conditions that would be harmful for people using the sports fields. The Station did preliminary testing on the crumbs and did find substances contained in the crumbs that were potentially ha zardous to health. Furt her testing is needed, however, the state is not willing to fund the research necessary to determine the risk in using the new fields. The New Haven Register of May 19, 2008 carried the article \"State earmarks funding to study rubber in fields\" by Abram Katz. $200,000, part of a $750,000 settlement between Connecticut and developers and construction companies that caused damaging mud slides in Montville in 2005, will be used to monitor the use of \"tire crumbs \" in athletic fields and compost. The State Department of Environmental Protection will use th e money to determine if athletic fields built with the \"tire crumbs\" are safe for those using them, and what kinds of hazardous materials the players are being exposed to. The Experiment St ation will be involved in the testing, and, during warmer weather will test 30 artificial turf fields and the players. Each field will be monitored separately because tires are all different in composition. Dr. Loui s Magnarelli stated that \"the origin of the tires in not known. Some may be domestic and others could be imported, meaning they could have different compositions.\" The Hartford Courant of June 21, 2008 carried the ar ticle \"Mosquitoes in stat e have West Nile\". The article reported that batches of mosquitoes trapped in Stonington have come up positive for 26 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 West Nile virus. They were the first to show a presence of the virus in the 2008 season. Dr. Theodore Andreadis stated that the finding of the virus-infected mosquitoes came earlier in the year than usual and further monitoring will be conducted. The New Haven Register of June 26, 2008 carried th e article \"Right in our backyard: Onslaught of invasive plants threatens native species throughout the st ate\" by Jim Shelton. The article reports on species of plants that aren't native to the area that have established themselves in the area and that are choking out many native species . Greg Bugbee was interviewed about aquatic species that have taken over many of the lakes in Connecticut. He stated that two-thirds of the lakes and ponds that he has examined have invasi ve aquatic weeds. In all, there are 96 species on the invasive plants list in Connecticut. The New Haven Register of June 27, 2008 carried th e article \"W. Nile viru s pops up earlier this year\", by Victor Zapana. The arti cle reported that the West Nile virus has been detected earlier in the state this year, according to Dr. Theodore Andreadis. He stated that the virus usually shows up in late July and peak season lasts from August to September. Scientists weren't sure if this indicates an extended West Nile virus p eak, and they warned people to take precautions. The Hartford Courant of June 27, 2008 carried the ar ticle \"Mysterious bee disorder spares state - so far\" by Bill Leukhardt. For the last two years, a mysterious disease has been causing bees to disappear and not return to their hives. The c ondition, colony collapse diso rder, has been said to have destroyed up to 90 percent of hives in othe r parts of the country. Ira Kettle, who checks bee colonies daily throughout the state, said he has not seen colony collapse disorder yet in Connecticut. He stated many problems have been attacking bees in recent years.

I was more pleased with your talk about your research on the effect of Fusarium on Spartina grass, which is causing Sudden Wetland Dieback. It dr amatically showed how a group of organisms can dramatically affect the ecology of our coasta l wetlands.

Biology today emphasized molecular research, and, therefore, it has become my mission to expose my students to the world of organisms and how they relate to molecular biology.

Pesticide residues in food: Analysts: Walter Krol, Brian Eitzer Goal: determine concentration of agrochemical s in fresh and processed foods from local, domestic, and imported sources offered for sale in Connecticut to assure compliance with established tolerances Market basket survey samples collected by Inspector Ellen Sloan of the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection Results published in annual Stati on bulletin available by mail and at www.ct.gov/caes From 1 January through 31 December 2007, 198 samples of fresh (118; 59.6%) and processed (80; 40.4%) fruits (100), vegetables (8 7) and other (11 total: honey (5); grain (6)) samples were analyzed for pesticide residues Beginning 1 January 2007 all market bask et samples were analyzed using the QuECHERS method, providing lower limits of det ection and increased number of detectable agrochemicals. Please see th e Record of the Year 2006-2007, th e RESEARCH section below, and Station bulletins for details. Results: of 198 samples analyzed in 2007, 120 samples (60.6%) contained a total of 327 residues. The average residue found was 0.163 pp m, and the average number of pesticide residues found on each sample was 2.62 in 2007. The impact on the pesticide residue program of fully implementing QuECHERS in our laboratory is shown graphically in Figure 1 below. It The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 97 must be noted that since 2005 the average residue value determined has d ecreased by a factor of 10. During the same period the number of pesticid e residues detected has more than doubled! Figure 1. Data highlights: total of 45 different pesticide active in gredients were detected and quantitated. Of the 198 samples analyzed, 78 (39.4%) contained no detectable pesticide residues; 120 (60.6%) samples contained 327 pest icide residues. Of these 120 samples, six samples contained residues which had no tolerance on the commodities to which they were applied and were ther efore violative. 2. Fat content in ground meat Analyst: Craig Musante Goal: ascertain that percentage fat is consistent with product label Comment: reinstitution in 2007 of testing pr ogram following hiatus of several years Since 1 July 2007 seven samples have been subm itted and analyzed.

Eleven alcoholic products examined for authen ticity; of which 5 were determined to be unauthentic. Analyses on behalf of CONNECT ICUT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION, PRODUCT SAFETY DIVISION 1. Miscellaneous samples Analyst: department staff From 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008 analyzed 88 samples such as pencils, toys, ceramic ware for lead content. Two of the toys that tested positive for Lead were recalled by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Please see http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml08/08133.html IMPACT: Once again our laboratory is acknowledged fo r its rapid and accu rate response based on non-routine analyses. It is this quality which has been re cognized by federal agencies and acknowledged through our receipt of the Cooperative Agreement. Response of the caliber which our chemists provide is critical in cases of in tentional contamination or terrorist activities. Analyses on behalf of DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, WASTE MANAGEMENT BUREAU 1. PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and pesticides The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 99 Analysts: Brian Eitzer, William Berger, Terri Arsenault Goals: ascertain extent of PCB contamina tion associated with breached electrical transformers; ascertain pesticide concentration associated with mi sapplication or drift in support of Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Matrices include, but are not limited to soils, sediments, foliage, surface wipes, fabric, air From 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008 total of 99 samples were analyzed of which 27 were PCB analyses Highlighted samples: In the fall of 2007, inspectors from DEP were notified of a greenhouse operation that was suspec ted of discharging water from an ebb and flow irrigation technique without appropriate pe rmits. Seven samples of water and soil were delivered to our laboratory and found to contain elev en different insecticides and fungicides, included in the list of twenty-two known to have been used at the facility. In add ition, elemental analysis revealed the water samples contained elevated levels of calcium, potassium, magnesium, and zinc, consistent with fertilizer. IMPACT: Rapid and accurate reporting of polychlorin ated biphenyls in the environment can be critical to clean-up and health issu es. Our scientists have been able to provide analytical results to the appropriate staff at Connecticut Departme nt of Environmental Protection to assure the safety of sites acces sible to the public. 2. Analysis of polar pesticides Analyst: Christina Robb Goals: to develop capability to analy ze for polar pesticides using LC-MS/MS. Background: Although our laboratory has had cap acity to analyze for volatile pesticides using GC/MS for many years, analysis of extr emely polar compounds has only been available since our acquisition of LC/MS capability. Polar compounds require specific sample preparation and chromatographic conditions to permit LC-MS/ MS analysis and, theref ore, are invariably single residue methods. Procedures have been developed and impl emented in our laboratory to accomplish glyphosate determination in a variety of matrices. Please see Research Section below. 4 samples were analyzed for glyphosate using the new method. Analyses on behalf of MUNI CIPAL and FEDERAL AGENCIES 1.

FOOD SAFETY Project: Comparison of two Methods for Determi nation of Pesticide Residues in Food Investigators: Terri Arsenault, Brian Eitzer, Walter Krol Summary: Extensive comparison of previous extraction method, the VegPrep, with the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, Safe (Q uEChERS) method. Fully updated and presented in Bulletin and graph in Figure 1. Project: Improvement to FERN methods Investigators: Terri Arsenault Summary: Integral to our Cooperative Agreem ent with the FDA is assessment of various FERN procedures for detecting toxins in foods . The current FERN method for examining food for potential toxins by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry involves a simple extraction of the matrix with acetonitrile followed by conve ntional hot splitless in jection into a gas chromatograph. The method is intended to be ap plied to a large number of matrices and toxins, so it is deliberately both simple to perform and has no clean up of the extracts. However, during the course of matrix evaluations, the extracts we re found to degrade the an alytical column very quickly. By installing a Progr ammable Temperature Vaporizati on (PTV) inlet, and using the more modern technique of solvent vent inj ection, it was found that the degradation was minimized and the method was far more rugged. This work was presented at the FERN CAP meeting in April of 2008 as already mentioned. Project: Electron Beam Irradiation for Improvin g the Safety of Fru its and Vegetables Investigators: Alejandro Castillo and Luis Cisneros-Zevallos (Texas AgriLife Research, Texas A&M University), James Dickson (Iowa St ate University), MaryJane Incorvia Mattina (Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station) Summary: While the application of Good Ag ricultural Practices (GAP) seems to be effective at preventing the introduction of bacter ial pathogens in produce for most cases, other factors that are yet to be understood may favor the contaminati on in some instances. Therefore, contaminated fruits and vegetables may reach consumers and it will take time to understand the factors that promote the presen ce, spreading or magnification of pathogens in crops along the processing chain. This makes it necessary to co unt on a treatment that ensures the safety of fruits and vegetables to enable consumers to meet the government's nutri tion goals that include increasing consumption of fresh fruits and vege tables. Electron beam (e-beam) irradiation can reduce or eliminate the pathogens, but may aff ect the quality of the product. To develop meaningful e-beam treatments it is imp erative to determine the D-value of Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7 and hepatitis A virus (HAV), which are th e 3 foodborne pathogens that most frequently are found to cause outbreaks of f oodborne diseases linked to produce. It is also paramount to determine the maximum dose that each comm odity can stand without physical damage. Secondarily, the effect of post- harvest irradiation of produce on the alteration, if any, of produce- borne agrochemicals is important in evaluating the consequences of e-beam irradiation of produce. Therefore, the objectives of this project are: to determine D-values for Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7 on lettuce, spinach, fresh-cut cantaloupes, fresh-cut tomatoes, and of HAV on green onions and fresh strawberries; to determine the maximum dose of e-beam energy that can be irradiated onto each of these commodities without changes in firmness, color, 102 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 respiration rate, and overall microbiological counts; and to determine the effe ct of post-harvest e- beam irradiation on the molecula r stability of produce-borne agro chemicals. For determining D- values, produce will be spiked with the select ed pathogens and then subjected to e-beam irradiation at increasing doses. Plate counts will be conducted on samples of irradiated produce. HAV enumeration will be conducted using the Virus Plaque Assay. Non-i noculated batches of the same commodities will be irradiated at in creasing doses up to 5 kGy and subjected to instrumental analysis including firmness, color and respiration rate te sts, and microbiological analysis including aerobic plate c ounts, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts and molds counts. The final objective will be achieved by testing produce from crops that have field-incurred agrochemicals to determine the pre- and post-i rradiation chemical signatures of these compounds using mass spectrometry interfaced to both gas and liquid chromatography. This study should permit collecting useful data fo r further development of strategies for reducing pathogens in fresh and fresh-cut produce after GAP and Good Manufacturing Pract ices are applied. Project : Toxins through QuECHERS Investigators: Walt Krol, Christina Robb, Brian Eitzer Summary: To assess if the standard QuECHE RS sample preparation procedure can be used to analyze the toxins de signated for LC/MS and GC/MS analysis by FERN using standard FDA methods. To date we have demonstrated that most of the toxins are amenable to extraction from distilled water and from two different matrices using the QuEChERS protocol. The QuEChERS method may prove to be an excellent confirmatory or screening method as part of the FERN repertoire. Project: Issues Associated with Ortho-Phenyl Ph enol in Paper Products in Contact with Food Investigator: Walter Krol Summary: ortho -Phenyl phenol (OPP) and its sodium salt ortho -phenyl phenate are registered for use as a fungicide on 22 different crops including cherries, cucumbers, peaches and pears. Residues of OPP have been identified an d quantitated in produce samples received from the Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) for many years. A rash of indiscriminant 'illegal' findings of OPP pr ompted us to search for a possible laboratory source of contamination. No such laboratory source was dete cted. It was eventua lly discovered that the white paper bags used to colle ct the produce samples contained OPP at a level of 73.7 ug/g. Brown paper bags used as a control were found to contain OPP at an even higher level of 340 ug/g, while the laboratory paper towels and gloves used during the analysis were not found to contain any OPP. An hy pothesis was put forth that there is significant transfer of OPP from the paper to the produce contained within the bag. The inspector from the DCP was instructed NOT to use paper bags for the collection of samples owing to the potential for cross contamination. To prove the validity of our cross contam ination hypothesis, in the Spring of 2008, a transfer study was designed and undertaken to ev aluate the transfer of OPP from brown paper lunch bags purchased from five separate sources. The majority of the bags were found to contain OPP. Strawberries obtained from a local pick your own farm were placed in the bags and refrigerated overnight. Following QuEChERS extraction and analysis , all the strawberries in the bags were found to contain OPP. In addition, the paper bags used to store the strawberries were found to contain pesticide residu es found to be present on the st rawberries. This work has The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 103 unequivocally demonstrated that physical contac t between produce and the container in which it is stored results in transf er of pesticide residues. Project : ELISA Screening Investigators: Christina Robb and William Berger Summary: In the last year, ELISA ha s been used for ricin analysis and -amanitin analysis. The ricin analysis has be en expanded to include an intact ricin analysis from the FERN program. Our laboratory was selected to help assess the new methodology and perform intact ricin analysis in a variety of matrixes. -Amanitin was analyzed as part of a proficiency test. II. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING Project : Analysis of Polar Pesticides Investigators: Christina Robb Summary: To develop analyti cal capabilities to analyze pola r pesticides by LC-MS/MS. Glyphosate : Direct analysis using a sp ecialty porous graphite carbon st ationary was compared to a derivitization procedure for gl yphosate analysis. The derivitizat ion procedure was determined to be more reproducible. The derivitization agen t is FMOC. Derivitizati on conditions and sample clean up were determined and a rugged LC-M S/MS method developed. Due to the high amount of buffer necessary for the derivitization proced ure, tuning the instrument on the derivitized compound proved difficult. Paraquat/Diquat : LC-MS/MS method development for the analysis of paraquat/diquat is underway at this time. The two options for analyzing these compounds by LC-MS/MS are 1) using an ion-pair agent in the mobile phase and us ing a standard C18 stati onary phase or 2) using a HILIC stationary phase. Currently, the HILI C stationary phase is being investigated. Project: Mechanisms of Uptake by Terrestrial Pl ants of Legacy Pesticides from Soil Investigators: MaryJane Incorvia Mattina, William Berger Introduction: This project illustrates the overlap of service and resear ch activities in the Department of Analytical Chemistry. In 1990 sa mples from our market basket survey were found to contain chlordane residu es, although the registration for this insecticide on food crops had long been terminated. Our research has show n that some agrochemicals have measured half- lives in soil of years, decades, and, unbelievably, centuries in some instances. Back in 1990 we noted that not all the crops from a Connecticut organic farm contained the residues, and this observation has sustained the line of inquiry that we have pursued over the years. What is unique about C. pepo ? We are not the only la boratory to report that Cucurbita pepo plants (zucchini) have a remarkable ab ility to uptake highly weathered residues of organochlorine compounds, including chlordane, DDT, and dioxins, from soil. Data from grafting experiments in our latest publication (MaryJane Incorvia Mattina, William A. Berger, Brian Phyt oaccumulation of Weathered, Soil-borne Analyses at the ex Planta and in Planta sides of the plant root\" Plant and Soil doi 10.1007/s11104-006-9182-4 (2007)) prove s that root physiology is the foundation of C. pepo's unique phytoaccumulation properties. Laboratory methods to investigate C. pepo uptake of pollutants: Uptake by squash of organochlorine compounds must be opportunistic sin ce there are no nutritional needs for these substances in the plant. We have hypothesized that these substances \"p iggyback\" on genetically- 104 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 68 6 9 70 7 1 72 73minutes0%25%50%75%10 0 %No rm H oag d Me rg ed 195 :425 based root physiology evolved for moving nutrients from ex planta regions across the root barrier to in planta regions. Our experiments have elimin ated root exudation of organic acids as one possible nutritional pathway. To study the po ssible role of boron pathways as an uptake route for the pollutants, we have developed a technique to grow C. pepo on glass beads to mimic soil conditions. Plants are grown on very low boron content ballatini in a nutritionally complete Hoagland's solution for 3 weeks. Then this soluti on is drained and for some plants is replaced by nutritionally complete Hoagland's spiked with technical chlordane and for other plants with Hoagland's lacking boron but sp iked with technical chlordan e. After 24 hours under these regimes, the plant shoot is severed and xylem sa p is collected (see Figure 2). Collection over 4 or fewer hours produces xylem sap with a distinctly different component pattern from that of the technical chlordane originally spiked (see Figure 3). We are designing ex periments to ascertain if there is a correlation between this pa ttern and the boron status of the plants. Red is Xylem sap Green is spiked Hoag Figure 2. Collecting xylem sap Figure 3. Comparis on of in planta (red) with ex planta (green) Project: Heavy Metals in Community Garden Soils Investigators: David Stilwell, Craig Musante, John Ranciato We are conducting an ongoing program on the environmental impacts of lead (Pb) and other heavy metals in community garden soils and plants. Between 2004 and 2007, 174 soil samples collected from 25 gardens in 10 Connect icut cities and towns were analyzed for their heavy metal content. The results indicate that the levels of lead and arsenic in a number of community gardens exceed State guidelines. In eight gardens (32%) wi despread contamination was found where the average lead (Pb) and or arse nic (As) levels exceeded State guidelines (400 mg/kg Pb, 10 mg/kg As). In 6 gardens (24%), sporadic contamination was indicated when one or more soil samples exceeded the Pb or As guidan ce level. In 11 gardens (44%), all of the soil samples were below 400 mg/kg Pb and 10 mg/kg As. Sampling of all community garden soils is recommended for lead and arsenic, and where wa rranted, remediation actions should be taken in order to decrease the potential lead and arse nic exposure among community gardeners. Project: Heavy Metals in Plants from Community Gardens Investigators: David Stilwell, Craig Musante, John Ranciato Though soil ingestion is expected to be the major source of exposure in contaminated gardens, consumption of plants grown in these so ils is also important to consider. In this investigation, the heavy metal content in 10 co mmunity garden grown produce samples from 4 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 105 gardens, were compared to 18 store bought produce samples by Inductively Coupled Plasma- Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The garden grow n produce consisted of lettuce, broccoli, bell peppers, cilantro, co llard and red cabbage. Soil samples from these gardens were also taken for analysis. The store bought produce included a variety of salad green s, cilantro, bell peppers, and collard greens. Comparison of the average amount s of the various heavy metals in store bought versus community garden produce showed that th e only significant difference was in the lead content. The lead content (\u00b5g/ kg) in all of the store-bought pr oduce ranged from <10 to 94, and averaged 23\u00b121, while it ranged from <10 to 2807 in the garden grown produce, averaging 505\u00b1205. Even though the lead was elevated in th e garden produce, they were all below the international limits of 3000-8000 \u00b5g/kg. The cadmium levels in the plants exceeded foreign limits in both commercial and garden-grown cilantr o, and in a commercial be ll pepper. Thallium was only detected in high amounts in brassicaceae pr oduce. The As, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Zn levels in all of the produce samples were within ranges wh ich were not considered excessive. The heavy metal content was higher in the stem and leaf compared to the fruit or flower. Project: Immobilization of Lead in Soil Using Phosphates Investigators: David Stilwell, Craig Musante, John Ranciato The effectiveness of using phosphate-based compounds to immobilize lead (Pb) in soils is well established. This tec hnique is based on the observation that insolu ble Pb compounds are produced after adding phosphates. In this study, we used EPA method 1312, the Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP), to predict the relative effectiven ess of three types of phosphate, ranging from soluble to highly inso luble (Sodium Dihydrogen Phosphate (NaP), Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) and Rock Phosphate (R P)) to bind lead in gard en soils. Eight soil sets were used in this study. We found that even modestly cont aminated garden soils (between 100-300 ppm Pb) can exceed the suggested SPLP limit for Pb (0.015 ppm). The threshold value calculated from a best fit linear relationship was 50 ppm. The average percent lead extracted was 0.7\u00b10.4 from unamended soils, 0.3\u00b10.1 in the RP amended soils at the 0.5% P level and 0.4\u00b10.2 in the TSP amended soils at the 0.5% level. Th us, at the 0.5% amendmen t level for RP or TSP the lead extracted is reduced by roughly 50%. However, no benefit was found in reducing extractable Pb when using solubl e phosphate in the form of NAP . The percent of P extracted from the soil with P treatment was quite signifi cant in the TSP and NAP amended soils, ranging between 8% in 0.1% TSP to 16% in 0.1% NAP am ended soils, and increasing to 15-35% in the 0.5% amended soils. Using no amendments or usi ng RP as an amendment the % P extracted was around 1% or less. Clearly, using RP as an amendment was vastly superior to TSP and NAP in minimizing soluble P. However, the P levels in all of the SPLP extracts (unamended, RP, TSP and NAP) exceeded the USEPA 0.1 mg/l water quali ty criterion for total P in agricultural runoff discharging into streams. Use of RP as the P amendment was also superior to TSP and NAP in minimizing As extraction in As and Pb co-contaminat ed soils. In the context of potential runoff, this study suggests that RP performed best a nd should be the amendment of choice when developing remediation strategies to minimize both P and Pb in solu tion. Nonetheless, it is also clear that any action which reduces both the inflow of water into the soil and the direct runoff of water off the soil would reduce the amount of P and Pb in runoff feeding streams and lakes. An example of such remedial action would be to co ver the soil with a geo-textile, followed by with 15-20 cm of mulch, which could be readily replenished as needed. 106 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Project : Analysis of Pesticides in Honey Bee Pollen Investigators: Brian Eitzer and Kim Stoner (Dept. of Entomology) Summary: This is a new projec t that was initiated during the past year in response to the recent dramatic losses of honey bee colonies from the newly described Colony Collapse Disorder. The fact is, that honey bees have been in decline for years. Stressors to honey bees include: poor nutrition, migratory stre ss, parasitic mites, hive beetles, bacterial and viral diseases, and the widespread use of pesticides. We ar e conducting research in to how honey bees get exposed to pesticides through their foraging acti vities. A honey bee can travel up to two miles away from its hive as it collects pollen. It brings the pollen back to the hive for use as a food. During this time the honey bee can be exposed to any pesticides used in the residential or agricultural fields from which it collects. Although all pesticid es can potentially stress the honey bees, there is a particular interest in a new cla ss of pesticides know as th e neonicotinoids, as one member of that class (imidacl oprid) has shown significant hone y bee toxicity and has been banned in several countries. Our first effort in this area is a study that is aimed at determining the current typical background expos ure of honey bees to pesticid es. We are collecting pollen from a set of honey bee hives that represent urba n, suburban and rural locations. The pollen is brought to the laboratory where it is analyzed usi ng a multi-pesticide screening technique that we have developed. The method is based on the Qu ECHERS procedures used in our fruits and vegetables residue work. The pollen extrac t is analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry which has been shown to be both sensitive and selective. During the first year of this study we analyzed 110 pollens from six hive s. There were 41 diffe rent pesticides or pesticide metabolites active ingred ients observed in these samples. The concentrations of the pesticides were found to be highly variable. For example, in samples taken from the same hive the amount of imidacloprid went from 1 parts pe r billion (PPB) to 70 PPB then back to 1 ppb within a 1 week period. This would appear to indicate that this pesticide was used somewhere within the bees' 2 mile radius foraging area that week. A second study within this area is being initiated this year. We will examine how much of a systemic pesticide applied as a seed treatment prior to planting will be found in the polle n of the plant when it blooms. We will then compare the plant pollen with pollen collected by bees that are caged so that they can only forage from that field. We are also participating in a large multi-state, multi-institutional, research project on honey bee health that will be starting in the summer of 2008. Figure 4.

NATURAL PRODUCTS Project: Analyses of Samples for Nootkatone Analyst: Terri Arsenault, Drs. Kirby Sta fford and Anuja Bharadwaj (Department of Entomology) The effectiveness of nootkatone, an essential o il of grapefruit and other plants, for control of the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), the primary v ector of a bacterial pathogen for Lyme disease, is being investigated. In year one (2008), applications were made at six different sites for two levels of active ingredient (twelve sites total) to track the degradation of nootkat one. Filter paper samples were laid prior to the application, then collected immediately and over a two to three week time period. The collection technique is presented in Figures 6 and 7. In year two, the goal is to develop a formul ation that will be more persistent in the environment and thereby give better long-term control. Figure 6. Method for field collection of applied noot katone Figure 7. Detail of collection device PUBLIC OUTREACH We assisted with a Yale graduate student's research project. Se ven samples of water from Costa Rica were analyzed for pesticides. Th e only pesticide found was diethyltoluamide. Telephone/internet inquiries : We receive frequent calls from the public requesting information on issues such as pesticides in food and in th e environment, lead in paint, food, soils, and consumer products. In some instances we re fer the caller to a more appropriate Station Department or State agency. We typically ha ndle over 1000 such inquiries each year. As more persons gain access to the Internet, inquiri es are coming from beyond Connecticut. Station Bulletins : Station Bulletins are typically publis hed annually by our Department. These bulletins are available in printed form and on the St ation's web site. They are also available at libraries throughout Connecticut. 108 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Fact Sheets : Listed on the Station's web site under \"Publications\" are several articles written for the general public regarding topics of timely and widespread interest . These are also available in printed format. Department members also coopera te with the Connecticut Department of Public Health in producing fact sheets published by them. New Haven Sound School : Two members of our Department, Drs. David Stilwell and Brian Eitzer, serve on the advisory council of New Haven Public School's Sound School. New Haven Public School Science Fair : This past year Walter Krol served as judge for this well established science fair. MaryJane Incorvia Mattina desi gned and printed a Department of Analytical Chemistry brochure for distribution to visitors and others in terested in a brief summary of our work. DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHE MISTRY AND GENETICS Genetic Manipulation of Glucosinolates in Brassica: Dr. Neil McHale began work on genetic manipul ation of glucosinolates in Brassica napus as a biological approach to suppression of soil-borne nematodes. The pr oject is a collaboration with Dr. Ross Koning (Eastern CT State University), Dr. James LaMondia (Windsor Valley Lab), Dr. Christina Robb (Analytical Chemistry) with technical assistance from Regan Huntley. Nematode control can be achieved through application of chemical fumigants to the soil, but these are restricted use pesticides with a variety of safety problems, both for farm workers and for residents of ag ricultural regions. Regulatory restrictions have prompted inte rest in sustainable methods of control, particularly those i nvolving crop residues that break down to release nematicidal compou nds in the soil. Plants in the mustard family are of particular interest because they produce a broad spectrum of nematicidal metabolites known as glucosinolates (GSLs). GSLs are derived from simple amino acids and by themselves have no biological activity, but when tissue is damaged by insect feedi ng, they come in contact with specialized enzymes called myrosi nases that cleave the glucose moiety from the core molecule. This results in spontaneous rearrangemen ts leading to formation of nitriles and isothiocyanates with biologica l activities against a range of pathogens and herbivores. Until now, the complexity of GSL profiles has precluded the assignment of biological activity to specific compounds, but the genes regulating nearly all aspects of GSL biosynthesis have now been identified in Arabidop sis, a closely related crucifer with a fully sequenced genome. These genes and their orthologs from Brassica are now available as experimental tools to address this question, and u ltimately generate strains of B. napus with GSL profiles targeted to specific pests. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 109 Two related transcription factor s in the MYB family (MYB28, MYB 51) have been identified as key of aliphatic and indolic GSL bios ynthesis in Arabidopsis. Our to clone the orthologous genes from B. napus and generate transgenic strains where aliphatic and indolic GSL levels are elevated or repressed as experimental ma terial for nematode suppression trials. Because aliphatic GSLs are most abundant and diverse, we are focusing first on genetic manipulation of this class, using transgenes th at alter levels of MY B28 expression. Primers based on conserved regions of Arabidopsis MYB28 were used to amplify candidate cDNAs from the florets of the \"Dwarf Essex\" a high GSL/biennial strain of B. napus , and from \"Sterling\" a low GSL annual variety used for production of canola oil. Seque ncing and mock translation of partial cDNA clones from both strains reveal ed an amino sequence with strong homology to MYB28 in Arabidopsis. New primers were desi gned for isolation of full length cDNA clones, and used to examine levels of MYB28 expression in the florets of \"Dwarf Essex\" and \"Sterling\" with a semi-quantitative RTPCR analysis (Fig. 1) . Because canola varieties were bred for low GSL levels in seeds, our hypothesis was that \"S terling\" would show lower levels of MYB 28 expression in florets, and this was in fact the case. MYB28 mRNA is de tectable after 30 cycles of PCR amplification in \"Essex\" but not in \"Sterling\", and is at least 10-fold hi gher in \"Essex\" after 33 cycles. This confirms that MYB28 is a GS L regulator in Brassica, as in Arabidopsis, and suggests that breeding of low GSL canola oil varieties may have been accomplished through genetic repression of MYB28 expr ession in flowers and seeds. Impact Our immediate aim is to improve agricultural su stainability in the Northeast with a biological alternative to chemical pesticides. The stakeholde rs in this are the farmers, as costs associated with chemical fumigation can approach $500 pe r acre. Farm workers would also benefit immediately from reduced pesticide exposure. The broader impact s will extend well beyond this, however, to all U.S. citizens residing in pr oximity to agricultural operations. Non-chemical pest control strategies will be cr itical to maintenance of water qua lity and human health in these regions. Protecting Honey Bee Hives from American Foulbrood Disease: Dr. Douglas W. Dingman , assisted part-time continued work on the causative agent of of honeybeees ( Apis mellifera ). In collaboration with Mr. Ira Kettle (Connect icut state bee inspector) research to characterize the presence of AFB in Connecticut has been ongoing for one season. Bee samples were obtained from 35 apiaries comprising 96 beehives. Of these 96 beehives, 8 (8%) were visually diagnosed to have AFB. Using a micr obiological assay, 41 other beehives (out of 73 hives tested) were found to have \"sub-clinical\" cases of AFB. At present, 67% of the beehives tested in Connecticut have AFB infections to varying degrees. This finding is in ag reement with the findings of a national survey. In an assay to develop a simple identification procedure, 50 P. larvae isolates, obtained from these infected hives, were shown to have the same 110 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 ITS-PCR fingerprint. Genomic fingerprinti ng PFGE has demonstrated three phylogenic types of P. larvae for 20 of the isolates tested. P. larvae type I was the most prevalent at 68%. Work to characterize this bacterium and produce a map showing geographical distribution of the disease and distribution of the various types of P. larvae is continuing. An investigation to develop a sanitation protocol for cleansing beehives of P. larvae spores has been initiated. Phase 1 of a 3-phase investigation has been completed and Phase 2 is nearing completion. In Phase 1, the sanitizing agent was shown to inactivate P. larvae spores in aqueous solutions within 20 minutes of exposure at the recommended concentr ation. In Phase 2, the effectiveness of the sanitizing agent to inactivate spores presen t on wooden supports and on beeswax surfaces is being tested. At present, inactivation has been found to be effective for the conditions tested. The start of Phase 3 will be de pendent upon successful completion of Phase 2. In Phase 3, the effectiveness of the sanitizing agent will be examined under \"real world\" conditions and development of a standardized and simple protocol for use of the agent by beekeepers will be initiated. Genetic testing was also continued on insertional mutagenesis libraries of Paenibacillus popilliae and Paenibacillus larvae . These libraries provide a molecular tool for investiga ting and isolating genes of these two entomopathogens. Inverse P CR was demonstrated useful for screening of strains cataloged in the li braries and has helped ex tend sequences of several P. popilliae genes. Efforts to extend sequences of potential pat hogenicity-associated genes are continuing. Collaborative research with Dr. Richard Cowles ha s been undertaken to compare locally isolated strains of P. popilliae to non-regional isolated strains for disease efficacy. In vivo production of spores is underway as the first step in this comparison. Development of a simple protocol to control infestations by use of loca lly obtained grubs that are identified as being naturally infected with P. popilliae is being considered. Impact American foulbrood is one of the most devastat ing diseases to beekeepers worldwide. This study will characterize the geograp hical distribution of this orga nism in Connecticut and has potential to develop a simple and effective sanitation procedure to minimize or eradicate the spores (i.e., disease) from inf ected hives. In July 2009, a new state law will restrict use of chemical pesticides on many public grounds. At pr esent, there is no alte rnative to the use of chemical pesticides to control white grub infe stations of turf. Bi ological control with Paenibacillus popilliae is environmentally sound. The main go al of this study is to improve the efficiency of P. popilliae . Photo-Protective Mechanisms in Plants: Dr. Richard Peterson and Dr. Neil Schultes continued their collabora tion on light utilization and photo-protection in pl ants, with technical assistance from Carol Clar k and Regan Huntley. Plant leaves are like so lar panels, using solar energy for synthesis of carbohydrate from atmospheric carbon dioxide. Adverse environmental conditions, particularly water The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 111 deficit, result in physiological stress that diminishes photosynt hesis and reduces the productivity of crop plants. When photosynthesi s is curtailed, light is still absorbed, and now in excess, can lead to damage. Plants dissipate excess light predominantly through non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a process mediated by the psbS protein, located in photosystem II (PSII) of the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. Our ai m is to discern the mechan istic role of psbS in NPQ. Our approach is to undertake a structur e-function analysis of psbS by generating site- directed mutations, introducing these altered ge nes into plants and measuring photosynthetic parameters. Photoprotective Capacity in Rela tion to psbS Concentration : The mechanism of action of psbS leading to ex pression of the rapid ph ase of NPQ (i.e., qE) remains a mystery. As a fundamental step towa rd understanding the role of psbS in qE, the relationship between in vivo psbS level and the amplitude of the qE phase were examined in normal and psbS overexpressor lines of Arabidopsis. Over a ten-fold variati on in leaf psbS level we observed up to a nine-fold increase in qE. Leaf pigment analysis was crucial to interpretation of the qE-psbS relationships. Se veral interesting features of this relationship were evident: First, psbS levels in wild type leaves did not exceed a ra tio of one molecule per active photosystem II center and qE levels showed no trend with variat ions in psbS concentration within this range. Secondly, deviation from an apparent linear dependence of qE on psbS level for the overexpressors was associated with low leve ls of zeaxanthin. Thirdl y, a separate apparent cause of reduced qE capacity was a low ratio of antheraxanthin:zeaxanthin. These results will aid in interpreting the role of car otenoid excited states in the qE mechanism in collaboration with Dr. Harry Frank of the Department of Chemistry, Un iversity of Connecticut. Furthermore, this is an important step toward forming a basis for eval uating effects of discrete structural alterations to psbS. We have re-evaluated the response to excess li ght by the psbS-deficient line of Arabidopsis, Npq4-1 . This mutant is commonly assumed to lack photoprotective quenching. Nevertheless, we find that after prolonged illu mination in bright light that li ght-dark changes in NPQ are about 50% of that observed in wild type leaves. We note that the ki netics on onset and relaxation of quenching are considerably slower in Npq4-1 . These results are significant in that this psbS- deficient system offers a simplified alternative that may lack one or more distinct quenching processes present in wild -type material. Further experiments are planned to inve stigate the role of carotenoid composition and photosystem II an tenna structure on th is type of NPQ. Site-Directed Mutation of psbS - Engi neering Epitope Tags in psbS: Through extensive searching of DNA databases, we were able to construct complete psbS unigene sequences representing 65 psbS genes from 44 plant species (Schultes and Peterson, 2007). An extensive phylogenetic analysis base d upon these data revealed several conserved sites in the psbS protein as well as uncoveri ng specific amino acid positions possibly linked to adaptive evolution. This analys is also revealed several pote ntial positions in the highly conserved psbS protein that were variable and likely targets for in clusion of a short insertion of epitope sequences. A functional epitope tagged ps bS molecule represents a valuable molecular tool for protein quantification, st ructure-function analysis and n earest neighbor studies. We have separately engineered a six-His tidine tag and a nine-amino acid HA tag at the N and C termini of 112 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 the mature psbS protein and within a hydrophilic stromal loop region. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing the C terminal 6- His tag and N-terminal HA tag are available. Currently we are measuring the ability of these novel psbS-containing lines to perform qE portion of NPQ. Altering Photosystem II Antennae Composition in Thylakoids Seven different classes of light harvesting chlo rophyll-b binding (Lhcb1-7) antenna proteins are associated with the photosystem II in thylakoids . Although much is known about their ability to absorb light, little is know about th eir direct role in NPQ. As pr imary gatherers of light energy it is likely that Lhcb proteins inte ract with psbS either directly or indirectly in a complex to dissipate excess light energy. We are genetical ly preparing Arabidopsis lines that contain specific Lhcb compositions and that will also have va ried levels of psbS or epitope tagged psbS. These lines will be used for measuring qE portio n of NPQ and other photosynthetic parameters. 5; Lhcb3 & 6 and Lhcb3 & 7 have been generated. Other combinations of Lhcb proteins will be generated through the use of virus-induced gene silencing technology. The Lhcb composition has a profound effect upon the structur e of thylakoids. In turn, thyl akoid geometry is likely to have profound effects upon NPQ and other aspect s of photosynthesis including electron flow. The availability of these tailored lines will enab le us to investigate different key aspects of photosynthetic light gathering. Revealing the Site of Control of Electron Transport: Besides NPQ in the antenna system of PSII, a widely recognized control point for regul ation of photosynthetic el ectron transport resides at the cytochrome b6f complex situated between PSII a nd PSI. The rate of oxidation of plastoquinol by this complex is strongly depe ndent on the pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane. An alternative view holds that contro l actually occurs at the next step which is the oxidation of plastocyanin by the PSI reaction center. Our approach to resolving this issue is to measure the rate of PSI electron transport using in vivo transmittance changes at 810 nm as a function of plastocyanin concentr ation. In a related experiment, we have demonstrated that high qE values are attainable under ultralow illumination when CO 2 is omitted from the atmosphere. This exciting result sets the stage for measuremen t of rate of proton leak age across the thylakoid membrane for the intact leaf. These projects are being conducted in collaboration with Dr. Agu Laisk and colleagues at the Un iversity of Tartu, Estonia. Impact The main impact of this work will be deve lopment of crop plants able to withstand environmental stress. When water supply is limiting, the photosyntheti c apparatus can be damaged irreparably by continuous exposure to sunlight. Gene s under investigation here are critical to protecting plants from this damage. Our work has had a direct influence on the course of related ongoing work in the labs of Dr. Agu Laisk, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Tartu, Estonia and Dr. Ha rry Frank of the Department of Chemistry, University of Connecticut. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 113 DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY The Department of Entomology is involved in a variety of service, research, pest surveillance, and regulat ory activities. The primary servi ce activities are pr ovided through the Insect Inquiry Office. Staff in th is office answer insect-related que stions and identify insects and related arthropods for the public, government agen cies, growers, and business organizations. All scientists provide information to citizens of Connecticut by answering telephone inquiries, making farm visits, participating in meetings of growers and other groups, and speaking on their research. Most of the research in the Departme nt has a major applied aspect, addressing the integrated management of ticks; pests of field crops, trees, nurseries, and orchards, and wood- boring insects. Staff members also work closely with organic farmers and landscapers in Connecticut. The Office of the State Entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, created by the Connecticut General Assembly in 1901, is part of the Department of Entomology with responsibility, in part , to ensure our nursery industry is fr ee of plant pests and certify their products for shipment to other stat es and outside the United States. According to the latest census by the National Agricultural Stat istics Survey, the Connecticut Green Industry (i.e., nursery, greenhouse, floriculture, sod, Christ mas trees) is the largest agri cultural business in Connecticut with a market value of $246 million in 2002. An economic survey by the New England Nursery Association indicated that sa les by the Connecticut Green In dustry surpassed $1.1 billion in 2005. In conjunction with regulatory activities, Department staff conducts a surveillance program in Connecticut for a vari ety of established pests like the gypsy moth and for exotic plant pests, some of regulatory concern, that represent a threat to our green in dustry, forests, and urban ornamental trees and shrubs. Surveillance for plan t pests is performed in partnership with the United States Department of Agriculture th rough the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) program and the U.S. Forest Service. One example is the surveillance for Ramorum blight, a fungus-like pathogen that can affect many plants, but that can be particularly devastating to oaks. Other examples are the forest health surveys and statewide aerial survey for gypsy moth defoliation and a gypsy moth egg ma ss survey. The results of our plant and forest surveys may be found later in the Department's research activities along with summ aries of our regulatory activities. The staff of the Department of Entomology also takes the lead in providing extensive outreach activities for the Experiment Station by providing information to both children and adults about the Experiment Station's research at public events, health fairs, and agricultural fairs, such as the Eastern States Exposition (Big E) in Springfield, MA, the Connecticut Pu blic Television Family Science Expo, Celebrating Agriculture, Yale Peabody Museum's Biodiversity Day, Sikorsky Airc raft's Earth Day, and the Connecticut Flower and Garden Show. Honey bees, butterflies, wood-boring beetles an d/or ticks continue to be popular exhibits at these events.

The insect inquiry office in its present form has provided services for over 40 years. Insect identification se rvices date back to th e earliest days of the institution starting with the first Annual Repor t of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station published in 1877. The station announced that is was offering to \"identify useful or injurious insect.....and to give useful information on the various subjects of Agricultural Science for the use and advantage of the citizens of Connecticut\". Between July 31, 2007 and June 30, 2008 the insect inquiry offi ce served 6,030 people with identification of ov er 750 different insect, arachnid, anim al species, and diseases. Most of the inquiries were from visito rs (49.7% of total) to the office followed by telephone calls (40.3%), mail (8.8%), and e-mail (1.2%). Questions were related to food (9 %), pests of humans or a person's dwellings (32%), or natural re sources (59%). While te rmite inquiries dropped dramatically and requests for information on other household insect pests, such as pantry pests, wasps, carpenter ants, and carpenter bees also declined, household pest s still remained the leading pests of concern. Human bed bug inquiries have continued to increase in number and are one of the most important insects of household co ncern. Delusory parasitosis remained a leading inquiry, because many cases were physician refe rred. Boxwood leafminer, two-spotted spider mite in the northern half of the state, and pine bark adelgid inquiries were also elevated. Ticks, primarily the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis , had the highest number of specimens submitted for identification (3,113 and not incl uded in the previous totals). Most ticks are processed in a different laboratory at the Experiment Stat ion, but many specimens were submitted through the insect inquiry office. The office served private ci tizens, pest control opera tors, the real estate Left: Marisa Gillio, Dr. Gale E. Ridge, and Rose Hi skes (L to R) answer inquiries and identify samples in the insect inquiry office.

The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 115 industry, nurseries, land care bus inesses, arborists, health departments, other medical professionals, museums, municipalities, libra ries, state government, and the news media. Several new fact sheets were produced by Dr. Gale E. Ridge on bed bugs, carpenter ants, and the cat flea. A new service for Spanish spea kers has been very popular. The bed bug fact sheet has been translated into Spanish and por tions of the tick management handbook have been translated into Spanish, as well. Gale also helped illustrate a new Fly Management Handbook by Dr. Kirby Stafford . Rose Hiskes answered 2,179 of the inquiries from pest control operators, nursery growers, and the public and prepared fact sheets on the orange-striped oakworm, the lily leaf beetle, and winter moth. Impact: Stakeholder concerns about a variety of insects, spiders, other arthropods, animals and diseases were addressed. Proper identification pr ovided residents with guid elines for control if necessary and so reduced stakeholder concerns . Information was provide d on integrated pest management avoiding chemical control where possibl e. Correct identification also provided an opportunity for interception of exotic pests into the state of Connecticut. Bird and Butterfly Garden: The Bird and Butterfly Garden is a partnership of the Federated Garden Club of Connecticut, the Spring Glen Garden Club of Hamden, and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Maintenance an d improvements to the garden are done by farm manager Richard Cecarelli and his staff. Rose Bonito Hiskes , and Vickie Bomba-Lewandowski are involved with the garden as is the Spring Glen Garden Club which provides monthly care by its members. The gard en is open to the public Monday-Friday 8:30am- 4:00pm, it is closed on the weekends and state hol idays. The garden creates several favorable habitats for our native birds, butterflies, and pollinating insects and helps us determine which plants may work best in Southern Connecticut ga rdens. Plants are labele d for easy identification. The Bird & Butterfly Garden at Lockwood Farm is listed in the Nature Conservancy Open Days Directory for New England.

The State CAPS Co mmittee met at the Valley Laboratory of The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station on June 12. This committee is charged with protecting Connecticut's agricultural commodities and natural environment from e xotic insects, weeds and diseases. Twelve people, representing foresters, diagnosticians, Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station staff, Cooperative Extension staff, and USDA PPQ staff attended the meeting to discuss possible surveys for the state for 2009. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 117 Phytophthora ramorum remains a major concern becau se the biggest agricultural commodity in our state is the nursery and lands cape industry. Also of concern are the wood- boring beetles that threaten trees in our state: the emerald ash borer and the Asian longhorned beetle. Dr. Kimberly Stoner organized several farming orient ed conferences; the Community Farming Conference, Getting Started in Organi c Farming Conference, and IPM for Organic Vegetable Farms. Community Farming Conference (February 9, 2008, Jones Auditorium, New Haven). This event for community groups across the state that are developing or have community farms drew 60 people from 11 community farming groups. The keynote speaker was Bryan O'Hara of Tobacco Road Farm, Lebanon, CT who spoke on \"Farming for Survival.\" Other speakers were Brianne Casadei of Terra Firma Farm, Stonington, CT, on the role of animals on an educational farm; Mark Palladino, of Bristol's Farm, Cant on, CT, about how he works with elementary school groups,; and Jiff Marti n, of the Working Lands Allian ce, on how community groups can work with the farmers and officials of their town to make their town more \"farm friendly.\" This conference was organized with assistance from CT NOFA and Bill Duesing. Getting Started in Organic Farming Conference (February 16, 2008, Jones Auditorium, New Haven). This event for beginning farmers or farmers who want to transition to organic practices was attended by 28 people. Ryan Voila nd of Red Fire Farm in Massachusetts was the keynote speaker, with a presentation entitled, \"F rom Backyard Garden to Full Scale Farm.\" Other speakers were Bill Duesing, of CT NOFA, on soil health; Rob Durgy, of the University of Connecticut, on organic weed management; and Don Franczyk, of Baystate Organic Certification, on the process of certification as an organic farm. IPM for Organic Vegetable Farms (June 30, 2008, Fort Hill Farm , New Milford, CT). Over 60 people attended this on-farm workshop, where Dr. Stoner spoke on organic insect management and distributed resource material s on organic vegetable farming, soil building, cover crops, and organic disease management, and Pa ul Bucciaglia, the farmer at Fort Hill, led a tour of his farm emphasizing his cover croppi ng and weed management practices. Sponsors included - Fort Hill Farm, Northeastern IPM Center's Vegetable Work ing Group, CT NOFA, CT Agricultural Experiment Stati on, and the Natural Resources Cons ervation Service. Funding for this event was provided by the Northeast IPM Vegetable Working Group and the Connecticut Department of Agriculture's Ag Viability Grant Program. RESEARCH ACTIVITES Community Program for the Prevention of Lyme Disease : Dr. Kirby Stafford and Dr. Anuja Bharadwaj's 4-year project, funded by the Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ended in March 2008. The research focus in the last full tick season of the project (summer 2007) was larger scale field trials of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae Strain 52 for the control of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis (commonly known as the deer tick) as reported last year. This tick is the vector for the Lyme disease spirochete (Borrelia burgdorferi ), ). The majority of Lyme disease cases (75%) are acquired in the residential landscape, primarily through the nymphal stage of I. scapularis and, therefore, our studies ha ve been and continue to be conducted primarily at home sites. 118 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Natural Products and Entomopathogenic Fungi for Tick Control: Application was made to CDC in late fall 2007 for funding a new project evaluating natural produc ts for tick control. Dr. Kirby Stafford and Dr. Anuja Bharadwaj , Department of Entomology, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, were awarde d the CDC cooperative ag reement, which began April 1, 2008. The purpose of this new project is to evaluate natural products, particularly a compound from Alaska yellow cedar (and other sour ces) called nootkatone for the control of I. scapularis . Another objective is to develop new exte nded duration formulations of the compound to improve efficacy in the field. The formulati on work will be done in cooperation with Dr. Robert Behle at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service laboratory in Peoria, Illinois. In addition, work with the fungus M. anisopliae will continue under this project. We also will examine the possible use of the two materials together as part of an integrated tick management program. A new revised edition of the Tick Management Handbook was printed (7,500 copies) with the support of the Connecticut Office of Policy and Management and the Connecticut General Assembly this past year. It also is available on the Experiment Station's website. Dr. Anuja Bharadwaj began studies on the survival and efficacy against I. scapularis and of the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae Strain 52 (Met52) with Dr. Stafford in 2004 and experimental trials continued through 2008 with the assistance of Heidi Stuber and summer workers Lindsley Colligan and Katherine Dugas . The fungus is now being developed commercially in an oil-based emulsifiable concentrate (EC) the control of grubs and ticks unde r the label Tick-Ex (Novozymes Biologicals, Inc., Salem, VA). Noot katone is a component of the essential oil from the hear twood of Alaska yellow cedar, Chamaecyparis nootaktensis , which has much greater activity against I. scapularis than the oil itself. Noot katone is repellent and kills ticks at a very low concen tration (0.003%), but a higher rate (1-2%) appears necessary in the field. The comp ound is available as a sy nthetic and an extract from grapefruit. In June 2008, a field trial with 1.3% nootkatone was conducted at home sites in Salisbury, Canaan, and Cornwall. We were also in terested in determini ng if the fungus could compliment the nootkatone for tick control. A mixture of 0.1% nootkatone was tank mixed with Tick-Ex at a rate of 2.6 fl. oz. per 1000 square feet and applied at 5 sites. A total of 12 sites were sprayed, while 11 other sites (reside nces) served as control areas where no application was made. Ticks were collected at all sites through a summer to evaluate activity. Nootkatone was effective for control of nymphal I. scapularis . With a high rate (1.3%) of nootkatone, 100% control was achieved after three days of a pplication. Nootkatone combined with fungus brought 76% control in tick populations after three days of spray. Noot katone appears to lack a long-lasting effect in the field as the percent control declined to onl y 68% within 12 days. Evaluation of nootkatone residues was conducted in cooperation with the De partment of Analytical Chemistry. The filter papers caged in chicken wire/ mesh were spread at the time of application at the treatment sites to be recovered at set intervals of time. The analysis was done by gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques. The preliminary data also show that nootkatone degrades rapidly and penetration of leaf litter appears im portant. Work is being done on developing new extended duration formulations of Nootkat one to improve efficacy in the field. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 119 Impact : Results of the field experiment show that nootkatone has a potential to be developed as a natural tick control product. Work needs to be done to devise an extended release formulation for nootkatone so that it can la st longer in the field to control ticks. West Nile Virus Antibodies : Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli , Dr. John F. Anderson , Dr. Sandra L. Bushmich (UConn, Storrs), Dr. Michel Ledizet (L2 Diagnostics), and Dr. A. Koski (L2 Diagnostics), assisted by Tia Blevins , Bonnie Hamid and Dr. Nathalie Bonafe (L2 Diagnostics), continued their studi es on detecting antibodies to the West Nile virus in vaccinated and naturally exposed horses. Results of a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were compared with those of a plaque reduction neutrali zation assay (PRNT). The latter is considered the \"gold standard\" met hod for laboratory diagnosis of encephalitis virus infections. Earlier work showed that result s of both tests were hi ghly concordant (91% agreement). More recent studies indicated lit tle or no cross-reactiv ity of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi (the bacterial agent for Lyme disease) or of antibodies to Anaplasma phagocytophilum (the bacterial agent for granulocytic anapla smosis) in tests for West Nile virus. Four horse sera from undiagnosed, ill animal s in 1995-1996 reacted positively in an ELISA for West Nile virus antibodies but were negative by a PRNT. It was originally thought that these horses might have been exposed to the West Nile virus or a closel y related virus before the first documented outbreak of West Nile virus infect ion documented in Connecticut and Bronx, New York during 1999. Specificity test s, conducted in two independent laboratories (The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station and New York State Department of Health in Albany), revealed non-specific binding of antibodies (false positive react ions) for these four sera in the ELISA. In general, prevalence of false positive reactions was infrequent, and together with PRNT, the ELISA was judged to be suitable for pres creening large numbers of horse sera. Impact: The newly developed ELISA is being used e xperimentally to test horse sera for West Nile virus antibodies. The methods are being modifi ed to detect antibodies to other encephalitis viruses in mammals. Vectors for West Nile Virus : Dr. John F. Anderson's current research is focused on control of vectors of West Nile virus (WNV), the extrinsic inc ubation periods for horizontal and vertical transmission of WNV by various species of mosquitoes , and the control of bed bugs using insecticides and trapping. He currently is evaluating EPA registered and commercially available biological insecticides that can be used for the control of larval mosquitoes in catch basins. Culex pipiens pipiens and Culex restuans, which are naturally infected with WNV, develop in relatively large numbers in catch basins. Experiments are being carried out in Stratford, CT. One product showing initial promise is VectoMaxTM WSP, which contains the bacteria Bacillus subspecies Israelensis . Culex L., infected per os from a membrane feeder, transmitted West Nile virus at 26o C horizontally during feeding to hamsters and suckling mice and vertically to F1 progeny during egg deposition. Hori zontal transmission rates increa sed with extrinsic incubation with 75 to 100% of the females transmitting on days 16 through 25 post-infection (pi). No females deposited eggs infected with WNV follo wing the first blood meal on 3-8 days. Females vertically transmitted WNV during egg laying fo llowing their second, third, and fourth blood meals on days 13 to 33 pi. The sequence of horizontal and verti cal transmission was determined. Females may transmit WNV (1 ) horizontally to a hos t during feeding and subsequently vertically to her offspring duri ng egg laying, (2) vertical ly to her offspring during oviposition without prior hor izontal transmission to a host, and (3) horizontally to a host 120 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 without vertically transmitting the virus. These two means of transmission by Cx. p. pipiens contribute to the relatively high minimum infection rates that are reached in late summer and to the survival of virus during winter and initiation of amplification in the spring in the northeastern United States. We are currently studying extrinsic incubation periods sticticus , relatively common species in Connecticut that have been found naturally infected with WNV. Bed Bug Monitoring : Bed bugs, Cimex lectularius , are becoming increasingly abundant in Connecticut. We have tested a pit-fall tr ap for capturing bed bugs. This trap emits CO 2, heat, and various chemicals such as 1-octn-3-ol and s hort-chain fatty acids, such proprionic, butyric, and valeric acids mixed with L-lactic acid as at tractants. We captured more than 9,000 bed bugs in a vacant apartment during a one month tra pping period. The trap was manufactured by BioSensory, a Connecticut company located in Putnam. In addition, we have established laboratory colonies of bed bugs from New Haven and Ea st Hartford as well as a colony of bat bugs, Cimex adjunctus from Southbury . We have begun testing the effectiveness of various EPA-registered insecticides for control of bed bugs. Impact: New methods for monitoring and control of mosquitoes and bed bugs will reduce the risk for West Nile virus and the burden bed bugs pose on people, particularly in public housing. Surveys for Invasive Foreign Insects : In 2007, Dr. Chris Maier and his summer assistants, Evelyn Silva and Justin Beaty , conducted USDA-funded surveys to determine if the apple were established in Connecticut. The tortrix mo ths, which are fruit pests as caterpillars, were not captured in pheromone traps deployed in Hartford and Litchfield Countie s. The wood wasp, which, along with its symbiotic fungus, has kill ed hard pine trees in several eastern states, also was not discovered in the surveys in Fairfield, Hartford, and Litchfield Countie s, where Lindgren funnel traps baited with ethyl alcohol and alpha- pinene (the scent of pine) were deployed. Based on the absence of these insects in traps, fruitgrowers and foresters in Connecticut presently do not have to worry about these destructive foreign pests. In 2007 and 2008, Dr. Maier , assisted by Tracy Zarrillo , Morgan Lowry , and Rebecca Tellar , found many new sites where alien insects were established. In particular, they determined that four leaf-cutter bees (Anthidium manicatum, widespread in southern New Engl and. Distributional and flower-visiting records for these bees may assist in determ ining their impact upon native bees and their usefulness as pollinators of agricultural crops. Dr. Maier also obtained new distributional records for other non-native insect s, Chris Maier examines a Lindgren funnel trap that was used to capture longhorned beetles and wood wasps. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 121 In another study, Dr. Maier and his assistants documented that the European barberry fruit fly (Rhagoletis meigenii ), a near relative of the destructive apple maggot fly, occurs wher ever its hosts grow in Connecticut. Its larvae, or maggots, infest fruits of European and Japanese barberries, two invasive shrubs. Based on trapping with yellow sticky panels in 2007, they determined that the adult fli ght period extends from late June to the end of July. This fly may have potential as a biological control agent. Longhorned Beetles in Southern New England : The discovery of the Asian longhorned beetle ( Anoplophora glabripennis ) ( Callidiellum rufipenne ) in live trees in the upper Northeast has focused attention on longhorned beetles (Col eoptera: Cerambycidae) and their impact. Between 1998 and 2007, Dr. Maier and his assistants determined the host range of eight native and two exotic longhorned beetles that infest la ndscape plants in the Cupressaceae by rearing 5,806 adults of 10 species from the wood of four native and six introduced cupressaceous plants. The small Japanese cedar longhorned beetle, a pest in Connecticut, had the broadest host range, developing in nine woody species. Current investigations are desi gned to ascertain the distribu tion, the larval and adult food habits, and the adult flight period of comm on longhorns whose larvae bore into plants in southern New England. Dr. Maier has estimate d that about 225 species of longhorned beetles could reside in Connecticut. By combining data from trapping, rearing, and museum collections, they have documented the presence of 187 species (83% of the potential tota l) in the state. In all, Dr. Maier and his assistan ts have reared 60 species from dead wood collected in New England, and examined the adult seasonal activ ity of 80 species. They are developing a database, which now has over 5,800 entries with biological data. The fundamental information derived from this comprehensive study should help to determine where borers occur, what types of wood are at risk of attack, and when the adults are active. Pesticides in Pollen : Dr. Kimberly Stoner , with assistance from Nate Brettschneider , and in collaboration with Dr. Brian Eitzer of the Analytical Chemistry Department and Ira Kettle , the state bee inspecto r, has been collecting pollen from honey bee hives in four locations across Connecticut. Dr. Eitzer is an alyzing the pollen to determine levels of pesticide contaminati on. This research begins to address the concerns of beekeep ers that changing patterns of pesticide use, including syst emic insecticides that may contaminate nectar and pollen, ar e playing a role in the long- term decline of honey bees and other pollinators. Caterpillars in Cole Crops on Organic Farms in Eastern Connecticut : As part of a project funded by th e Northeast Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program, Dr. Stoner , with assistance from Nate Brettschneider and Tracy Zarrillo , has been collecting caterpill ars from crops in the cabbage family from the field The giant resin bee, Megachile sculpturalis , a species introduced from Asia. Pollen collected from a honey bee hive using a special pollen trap. 122 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 and rearing them out to determine levels of natu rally occurring parasitism . She has also been putting out sentinel populations of cross-stripe d cabbageworm, reared in the laboratory, to measure the rate of parasitism of this species through the year. The cross-striped cabbageworm, Evergestis rimosalis , is a relatively new species in Connec ticut, spreading to our state from the southeastern U.S. in the late 1990's. Dr. Stone r's work shows that at least one key natural enemy of this pest, the parastic wasp Cotesia orbenae , has spread to Connecticut along with its host caterpillar. Small Japanese Cedar Beetle: Dr. Claire Rutledge continued her investigation of two aspects of C. rufipenne 's chemical ecology in collaboration with Dr. Lawrence Hanks of the Un iversity of Illinois, Urbana- Champaign and Dr. Jocelyn Millar of the University of California, Riverside and their students. Callidiellum rufipenne is native to eastern Asia and was discovered in live arborvitae in Connecticut in 1998 by Gale Ridge, Carol Lemmon and Dr. Chris Maier. The borer has sin ce established in the southern half of Connecticut. C. rufipenne is found most frequently on plants in the families Cupr essaceae and Taxodiaceae. Males recognize females by means of a contact pheromone in the female's epicuticle. We have identified the contact pheromone as the branched, saturated hydrocarbon 5,17 - dimethylnonacosane. We also continued work on the function of the male-produced volatile phero mone. It appears to be a short- range aggregation pheromone which could potentially be exploited as a monitoring tool. Bronze Birch Borer : Bronze Birch Borer, Agrilus anxious Glory, a native insect, requires stre ssed living trees to de velop, and thus frequently attack birches in landscape and nursery settings. The beetles cause considerable aesthetic and financial damage to homeowners and nurserymen in Connecticut. In addition, the beetle is a con-gener of the invasive pest the Emerald Ash Borer, A. planipennis Fairmaire and information about the natural enemies, ecology and host location behavior of BBB could potentially be exploited to help control EAB. Results from summer 2004 suggested that borers can discriminate between stressed and healthy trees. Dr. Rutledge began to sample and analyze the air surrounding healthy and stressed birches in cooperation with Dr. L. Hanks of the University of Illinois and Terri Arsenault of the Department of Analytical Chemis try to attempt to isolate the attractive compounds. Another project comparing the mati ng behavior of BBB, EAB and Two-lined Chestnut Borer, A. bilineatus (Weber), another native con-gene r, is being done in collaboration with Juli Gould of USDA APHIS and Melody K eena USDA FS. The mating behavior of EAB is very similar to both BBB and TLCB except that EAB mates for 1 hour and BBB and TLCB mate for only 5 minutes. While the significance of this fact is still unknown, it s uggests differences in the ecology of the beetles which may be exploitable for control measures. Mordellidae Attraction to Methyl Salicylate - Published this past ye ar, large numbers of the tumbling flower beetle, Falsomordellistena bihamata (Melsheimer), were found in 2004 and 2005 on traps baited with sweet bi rch oil, whereas significantly fewer individuals were found on control traps. In both years, peak captures were at 680 degree days 10C. Trapping was conducted in Naugatuck State Forest in Naugatuck, CT. Little is known about the ecology and biology of Mate guarding by C. rufipenne The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 123 the tumbling flower beetles (Coleoptera: Mordelli dae), and the larval food plant for this species is not known. Thus, we cannot say why the beetle is attracted to sweet birc h oil. Sweet birch oil is ~99.8% methyl salicylate (MeSA). MeSA is found constitutively in la rge quantities in some plants, but it is also an important signal i n, and product of, plant st ress-response pathways. MeSA has been found to attract both herbivores that need stressed plants as food and natural enemies of herbivores in stressed plants. To our knowledge, this is th e first report of mass trapping of a tumbling flower beetle. Emerald Ash Borer - In collaboration with the CAPS program of USDA APHIS, Dr. Rutledge with the assistance of Mioara Scott is conducting a survey for Emerald Ash Borer, A. planipennis Fairmaire. Twenty traps specifically designed to attract EAB, purple panel traps baited with manuka oil, have been deployed throughout the state focusing on vulnerable areas such as ports, importers and campgrounds. To date no beetles have been found. NURSERY AND PLANT INSPECTION ACTIVITIES Plant inspection and regulato ry services are coordina ted and conducted by State Entomologist Dr. Kirby Stafford , Deputy State Entomologist Dr. Apiary Ira Kettle . Nursery Inspection and Certification : Three-hundred and sixteen nur series were certified to conduct intra- and interstate bu siness. There were 748 nursery inspections during the growing season. Eight-thousand, seven-hundred and four acres of nursery stock were examined as well as plants growing under 32,753,879-sq. ft. of greenhouse sp ace. The majority of plants were grown in hoop houses (28,408,300 sq. ft.), followed by plas tic greenhouses (2,642,447 sq. ft.) and glass greenhouses (1,703,100 sq. ft.). Nursery Insects : The most abundant pests found in nurseries were lacebug on Pieris, Rhododendron and Azalea , mites on various trees and shrubs, black vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus ) on Taxus, aphids on various trees and shrubs, Rhododendron leafminer on Rhododendron and Arborvitae leafminer on Thuja. Nursery Dealer Permits : Nursery dealer permits were issued to 181 firms. One-hundred and fifty-five of these companie s operate individual outlets. The remaining businesses have more than one outlet each. In to tal, there were 552 outlets. Phytosanitary Certificates : Three-hundred and sixty-th ree phytosanitary inspection certificates were issued covering the shipment of the following plant materials to destinations outside the United States: Emerald Ash Borer mating (photo by C. Rutledge). 124 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Plants Number Apples (Cartons) 11,700 Bulbs & Tubers (Dahlia, Lilium, Gladiolas) 1,170 Chinese tree peonies (plants) 2 Greenhouse plants 831 Nursery stock (containers) 255,039 (bare root plants) 6 Orchids (plants & flasks) 4,872 Perennials (bare root plants) 3,460 (plants) 21,900 Seeds (cartons & bags) 80 Tobacco (bales, boxes, bundles & cartons) 128,415 Japanese Beetle Certification : We observed treatments of 262,823 plants at one nursery and issued phytosanitary certificates to comply with states that quarantine nursery stock from Connecticut because of the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica . One nursery, which met the containerized nursery stock accreditation program requirements of the United States Japanese Beetle Harmonization Plan, shipped 2,500 plants to other states in 2007. Three nurseries met other requirements of the United States Japane se Beetle Harmonization Plan and shipped 2,282 plants to states that quaran tine plants from Connecticut. Japanese Beetle Certification to Canada : Twelve Connecticut nurseries, which met the inspection requirements of the US/Canada Japa nese Beetle Harmonization Plan, shipped 294,231 plants to Canada in 2007. Insect and Environmental Problems : We assisted nurseries an d private citizens with the following problems in 2007: 1. Inspected an arborvitae hedge for a homeowner who suspected Callidiellum rufipenne , Small Japanese Cedar Longhorned Bee tle. Beetle activity was confirmed. 2. Inspected firewood for a hom eowner for insect activity. 3. Responded to a call about feral honey bee ac tivity in a tree on a state right of way. Special Inspections : Twenty inspections were made fo r 208 individual plants and bulbs to assist homeowners moving out of state. Two to bacco growers had 123.5 acres inspected for the aerial application of pesticides . Eighteen post-entry inspections were carried out on 24,650 plants at 4 locations. At two sites, 1,822 plants were released from quarantine. Two-hundred and nine inspections were made to assist nurseri es moving the following plants interstate: The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 125 Plants Number Perennials (plants) 262,823 Nursery stock (containers) 2,500 (bare root plants) 1,759 (B & B) 1,710 Corn seed (pounds) 50 Geraniums 2,493 Greenhouse plants 523 Hemlock logs (Board feet) 60,000 INSECT AND DISEASE SURVEYS In cooperation with federal agencies such as USDA-APHIS-Plant Protection and Quarantine and USDA-Forest Service, we conduct surveys for a number of exotic pests that may threaten the health and productivity of Connectic ut agriculture and forests. These efforts are directed for early detection of introduced pe sts and diseases, which would facilitate rapid eradication and clean-up. Asian longhorned beetle, Emerald as h borer (mentioned earlier), Sirex wood wasp, Chrysanthemum white rust, daylily rust , and Ramorum leaf bli ght are just some of the insects or diseases that we survey for. Forest Health Monitoring : During the summer of 2007, we examined 51 permanent, one- acre forest plots that were established to monito r forest health in Connecticut. These plots are located on state, Nature Conser vancy, and municipal water compa ny properties. We considered 25 pathogens for monitoring and determined which trees served as host plants. Within each plot, 20 to 30 trees were tagged for long-term studies. We evaluated signs of defoliation and disease, such as dead tree branches, limbs and crowns. Descriptions and determinations are designed to reflect increasing damage or tree decline. We measure the trees at Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) as an additional way to monitor their heal th. We will continue to use these plots to monitor the forests over several ye ars to assess whether our state forests remain healthy or are declining. In addition, we conduct aerial surveys for damage due to gypsy moth, orange-striped oakworm, forest tent caterpillar, and anthracnose disease. In gene ral, our forests remain healthy. Gypsy Moth : Our annual aerial survey for gypsy moth defoliation was conducted by Dr. Smith , Peter Trenchard , and Tia Blevins in July-August 2007 and covered 1.8 million acres of urban/suburban forest in all eight Connect icut counties. Gypsy moth defoliation of 3,203.57 acres was found in four counties (see Table). This was substantially less than the previous year when 251,946 acres in five counties were defoliated. 126 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 In November and December, a gypsy moth egg mass survey was conducted in 80-95% favorable host sites on a 7 -mile grid (102 sites) throughout Conn ecticut. At six sites, egg masses were found in low numbers that may indicate a build up in population. Orange-Striped Oakwor m: The Orange-striped oakworm, Anisota senatoria , is a native moth that ranges from eastern Canada southward to Georgia. It is a common pest of oak species in Connecticut. Occasionally, local infestations occur when oaks have been stressed by other factors such as drought or gypsy moths. Serious defoliation can occur when this happens. The moths lay up to 500 eggs on the undersides of an oak leaves in early summer and are attracted to artificial light. The caterpillars feed on the fo liage, and then they burrow into the soil and build an earthen cell, where it pupates and passes th e winter. On September 18, 26, & October 1, 2007, a statewide aerial survey was conducted for orange-striped oakworm defoliation. Defoliation was found in Windham County (13,955.10 acres) and in New London County (8090.70 acres). Total acres defoliated were 22,045.80. Forest Tent Caterpillar : The Forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria , is a native insect found throughout the range of hardwood forests in North America. It is more abundantly distributed in eastern North America, but is also common in western areas that have large stands of aspen. At times, this insect can be a damagi ng defoliator of trees. Trees that are defoliated often flush a new, smaller set of leaves in July. While forest te nt caterpillar does not typically cause mortality to host trees, mortality can occur when populations interact with other disturbances, such as drought or insect outbreaks. Forest tent caterpillar larv ae use silk to form trails and to create pads on host trees where they congregate and rest. During 2007, an outbreak of Forest tent caterpillar resu lted in the defoliation of 27.6 acres in Litchfield County and 1010.7 acres in Windham County. A total of 1037.7 acres were defoliated. County Total Acres Hartford 737.57 Middlesex 268.50 New London 1687.80 Tolland 509.70 Total 3,203.57 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 127 Gypsy Moth - RED Drought Damage - BROWN Tent Caterpillar - YELLOW Fore st Hemlock Woolly Adelgid - GREEN Orange Striped Oakworm - ORANGE Unknown - BLUE Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis , first discovered to be attacking trees in August of 1996 in New York, has spread to within 25 miles of Greenwich in southwestern Connecticut. There is risk for beetle entry in ports because of the transportation of solid wood packing material on ships coming from areas of the world where this beetle is found. We, therefore, concentrated additiona l survey efforts in Connecticut in the areas of Bridgeport, Groton, New Haven and New London as well as their surrounding parks that contain a high percentage of maple, a favorit e food source of the Asian longhor ned beetle. All surveys and identifications, thus far, were negative. We also inspected trees for 1 homeowner in 2007.

During 2007, we required all hemlock nursery stock that was being shipped out of Connecticut to be treated for Hemlock woolly adelgid. Two nurseries shipped hemlock trees out of state. Our inspectors observed treatments and issued phytosanitary certificates to cover 1,710 plants in these shipments. We also certified 60,000 board feet of hemlock logs that were shipped to states with a quarantine. Pine Shoot Beetle : During February, 2007, Lindgren Funne l traps were set up for Pine shoot beetle. Fifty traps were set up statewide and were monitore d at two week intervals through mid-May. One adult Pine shoot beetle was found in the Town of Thompson in Windham County. All of Connecticut has be en added to the national Pine shoot beetle quarantine because of the presence of Pine shoot beetle in Massachusetts and Connecticut. County Traps Set for Pine shoot beetle Pine shoot beetles caught in traps Fairfield 17 0 Hartford 1 0 Litchfield 18 0 Tolland 5 0 Windham 10 0 Ramorum Leaf Blight : Ramorum Leaf Blight is a serious plant disease that attacks many types of plants and trees common to Connecticut. It is currently known to occur in the Pacific Northwest on oaks, azaleas, big leaf maples, huckleberry, California bay laurel, Pacific madrone, Douglas fir, rhododendrons, and viburnum. It does not affect humans and is not a food safety concern. Sudden oak death is caused by a pathogen called Phytophthora ramorum . The pathogen is not a fungus or a bacterium, but a member of a unique group of organisms called Oomycetes. Oomycetes sh are some characteristics of fungi but are biologically different. As part of the P. ramorum National Nursery Surv ey, we inspected 23 nurseries during the 2007. Du ring this survey so far, 35,500 plants have been inspected and 222 samples from symptomatic plants were submitted for lab analysis. All samples were cultured and tested by ELISA; DNA from ELISA-positive samples was tested by nested PCR in the CAES NPPLAP Certified Lab. One garden center that had a positive plant in 2006 was included in the survey as pa rt of the Confirmed Nursery Protocol. All samples from the nurseries as well as samples from the garden center were negative for P. Rhododendron showing symptoms of infection with P. ramorum (photo V. Smith). The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 129 ramorum . The garden center will be under the CNP until 2008. An aquatic survey was done in conjunction wi th the US Forest Service. Two streams were chosen for baiting: one near a location where positive plants were found in 2004 and buried in 2005, and one not near any potential sources of P. ramorum contamination. Streams were baited with rhododendron leaves during May through Se ptember 2007; the baiting period was about 2 weeks each month. Leaf baits were submitted for te sting to labs in Mississippi and at Cornell University. All leaf baits were negative for P. ramorum . Warehouse Survey for Wood Boring Insects : In early 2007, we conducted a trapping survey of 15 Connecticut warehouses in 5 counties to de tect the possible presence of exotic wood boring insects. Lindgren funnel traps, with a chemical lure, were placed in the warehouses and checked bi-weekly for insect activity. No exotic insects were found. Daylily Rust : A rust fungus ( Puccinia hemerocallidis) was found on daylilies in a southeastern U.S. nursery for the first time in the summer of 2000. It was found in Connecticut in 2001 and 2002 on daylilies owned by private citizens. It is now confirmed to occur in three counties. During 2007, we surveyed daylilies in nurseries and gard en centers for signs of this rust. One hundred inspections were car ried out on 616,605 plants. No signs of Puccinia hemerocallidis were found Chrysanthemum White Rust : During 2007, we continued to survey for Chrysanthemum white rust disease, caused by the fungus, Puccinia horiana . We inspected 2,048,997 chrysanthemums raised by 310 growers and dealers for the presence of chrysanthemum white rust. On September 11, 2007 we were informed of a possible infestation of Chrysanthemum white rust at a grower in Hartford County. On September 13 Chrysanthemum white rust was confirmed at the nursery. Following the initial find, two more nurseries (one in Fairfield County and one in New Haven County) were confirmed positive during inspections by Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station inspectors. At each site where Chrysanthemum white rust was confirmed, all host material was inspected for any symptoms and suspect plants were sampled for confirmation of Puccinia horiana . Once plants were confirmed to have Chrysanthemum white rust disease, all plants of that variety were disposed of by either deep burial on site, or incineration at an approved facility. Once the disposi tion of the infected material was complete, the remaining host material was treated with a f ungicide. After treatment, host plants were inspected again, treated with a fungicide 5-7 days after the initia l treatment and then inspected a third time. Once this protocol was completed, the host material was released by the USDA. Chrysanthemums showing symptoms of infection with P. horiana (photo V.

Trace forwards showed that Chrysanthemum plants had been shipped to 13 locati ons in Connecticut. At all of these locations, which were large retail st ores, host material was inspected and Chrysanthemum white rust was confirmed at 7 of these locations. An additional large retail store that was not on the trace forward list, but also received plants from the New Jersey supplier was also found to have Chrysanthemum white rust infected plants. All host material at each location was destroyed.

DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND HORTICULTURE Agriculture in Connecticut has s een vast changes in recent de cades. Tobacco and dairy farming, once the largest agricultural industries, have diversified with vegeta bles, nursery stock and Christmas trees. Concurrently, the marketing of produce has shifted from wholesale contracts with local supermarkets to direct retail sale s. There are approximately 560 farms which offer a variety of fruits, vegetables, be dding plants, and Christmas trees at roadside stands and sales rooms. About 120 of these are open all year. Ne arly 30% of these farms offer pick-your-own fruit and vegetables to reduce the cost of ha rvest labor. These savings are passed on to the consumer. There were 82 farmers' markets attended by 230 farmers in 2006 compared to 22 markets in 1986. As the popularity of farmers' markets in Connect icut have surged, so too has the need for growers to find a diversity of hi gh-value niche crops. Consumers used to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in large supermarkets are dema nding a greater diversity of ethnic and specialty crops at farmers' markets and roadside st ands. Since 1983, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station has been investigating sp ecialty crops to provide new opportunities for Connecticut's farmers. Cultivars of over 30 fruits and vegetables have been field-tested resulting in 36 publications. The crops studied include gl obe artichoke, Belgian endive, radicchio, pak choi, specialty melons, sweet potato, okra, and Ch inese cabbage. Crops that were chosen have a high market value and an existing or expanding market that would readily accommodate these commodities. 132 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Calabaza - Selection for Early Maturity: Calabaza squash, also known as tropical pumpkin, is mostly grown in tropical and semi- tropical climates. Calabaza is highly prized by consumers of Hispanic or igin. It was identified by the Connecticut Department of Agriculture as one of the most sought -after vegetables at Connecticut's 88 farmers' markets. Drs. Abigail A. Maynard and David E. Hill are developing a cultivar that produces fruit on shorter vines by saving seeds from plants that have produced fruit within 2 feet of the plant. These seeds are planted at Lockwood Farm and Windsor and selections are again made. Fruit that mature on short vines is appealing to northern growers because the majority of fruit can mature before frost. Fruit that form on longer vines do not always reach maturity. Last year, 84% of the plants at Lockwood Farm produced fruit within 2 feet of th e plant compared to 67% of the plants at Windsor. Selections will continue for several more years. Specialty Fruit Variety Trials : As wholesale marketing of major tree fruits becomes unprofitable, many Connecticut growers are turnin g to retail sales of their fru it. For a retail operation to be successful, there must be a diversity of products . Thus, many growers are interested in adding minor specialty fruits to their operations . In response to this grower interest, Dr. Maynard in 2001 expanded the New Crops Program at the Station to include fruits. This trial, also repeated at the Valley Laboratory in Windsor, includes 12 cultivar/rootstock combinations of Japanese plum. Impact: The greatest yields were from Shiro (45.0 lb/tree) and Obilnaja (33.5 lb/tree). At a retail price of $1.99/lb, a planting of 242 Shiro trees per acre would yield a potential crop value of $21,670/acre. Long-term benefits incl ude diversification and greater profits for fruit growers. At the request of fruit growers, 306 beach plum seedlings were planted in 2003 at the Station's two experimental research farms. These seedlings were raised at Cornell University from seeds collected from 35 sites from Maine to Delaware. Impact: In 2007, heavy yielding plants produced as much as 36 lb/plant. At a retail price of $2.00/lb, there is an expected crop value of $52,270/acre. The immediate impact is that growers at two of Connecticut's largest farm s are now growing beach plums, which can be made into a premium jam which sells for $6.4 0 for an 8 ounce jar. Long-term benefits include diversification and grea ter profits for fruit growers. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 133 Personal-sized Watermelons Trials: The newest melons on the marketplace are seedless miniature \"personal\" watermelons, weighing 3- 7 pounds each. Personal-sized watermelons offer an attractive alternative for small families or fo r consumers that have limited refrigerator space. Beside the smaller size, they also have a th inner rind, which reduces waste. In addition, researchers have found that lycopene and beta-car otene contents are abun dant in personal-sized watermelons. Lycopene, an antioxidant, has been linked to the possible prevention of cancer and heart disease. In 2007, Dr. Maynard evaluated the effect of black pl astic mulch on the yield and size distribution of the cultivar Vanessa at Winds or and Mt. Carmel. Unlike larger watermelons, personal-sized watermelons are sold by the mel on, not by the pound. Therefore, estimated yields were measured in number of fruit per acre. At bo th sites, there was a greater number of fruit per acre from plots amended with black plastic. This was primarily due to a greater average number of fruit per plant from plots amended with black plastic. The percentages of fruit in the 3-7 lb range from both treatments were virtually the same . Research will continue with evaluations of additional varieties and va rious cultural methods. Impact: At Mt. Carmel, plas tic amended plots produced an average of 4,535 more personal-sized watermelons per acre co mpared to unamended plots. At $4.99 retail price/fruit, the grower would potentially gross over $22,600 more per acre with black plastic mulch compared to no mulch. The long -term benefits include additional revenue for farmers and providing a product that has growing consumer demand. In addition, there may be health benefits for those who consume watermelon. Garlic Trials: Garlic, a bulbous plant closely related to the onion, has a wide number of market niches and is used in great quantities for cooki ng. Consumption of garlic in the U.S. has risen from 0.5 pound per person in 1985 to 3.1 pounds per person in 1999. To meet that demand, acreage devoted to the production of garlic rose from 16,000 acres to 41,000 acres, a 156% increase. No other vegetable, including popular vegetables like onions, broccoli, and carrots, has exhibited such strong sustained gr owth. One factor contributing to this strong surge in use is the rising popularity of ethnic foods and proliferation of ethnic restau rants. In addition, there have been numerous news releases describi ng the health benefits of garlic. Impact: Silver White had the greatest yields (1960 lbs/acre) and Romanian Red averaged 1851 lbs/acre. At a retail price of $2.50/lb, there is a potential crop value of $4,270/acre in Connecticut. The long-term benefits include additional revenue fo r farmers, especially those who attend farmers markets in urban areas. Chinese Cabbage Trials : Local supermarkets have reported increased sales of Chinese vegetables. These sales coincide with the influx of immigrants from the Far East. Vegetables are staples in oriental cuis ine and stir-fry cooking has become increasingly popular in the kitchen. In 1988-1989, 134 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 we tested 26 cultivars of Ch inese cabbage at Lockwood Farm and Windsor. Most of these cultivars are no longer available and, since that time, new cultivars have been developed that are more disease resistant and pr oduce higher quality heads. In 2007, 12 cultivars of Chinese cabbage were evaluated in spring and fall at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Impact: In spring, the cultivars Taranko (19. 4 T/A) and Yuki (18.9 T/A) had the greatest yields. In fall, Apollo (17.8 T/A) and Mirako (17.3 T/A) had the greatest yields. At a retail price of $0.99/lb, there is a potential crop value of $38,400/acre. High yields of a quality product will benefit local growers and consumers by providing revenue for farmers, a nutritious food for consumers, and preservation of farmland. Many municipalities in Connecticut with leaf collection programs in the fall are turning to farmers to dispose of their leaves. However, not all farmers have extra land to set aside for a standard composting operation. Instead, they layer undecomposed leaves on their fields and simply plow them under. This is called sheet composting. Nitrogen deficiency can be a problem in these soils because microorganisms involve d in leaf decomposition use nitrogen more efficiently than plants. There is some ques tion whether the differences in the rates of decomposition between oak and maple leaves would lead to differences in plant response when these leaves are used in a sheet composting opera tion. This is also a situation that confronts many home gardeners who have a predomin ance of oaks in their backyards. Sheet Composting of Oak and Maple Leaves : To help answer this question, Dr. Abigail A. Maynard conducted a sheet composting experiment in which plots were amended with either all oak or all maple leaves. Undecomp osed leaves were layered about 6 inches thick in the falls of 1994-2006 and incorporated into the soil by rototilli ng. Yields of lettuce, peppers, rutabaga, and leeks were compared to yields from the control plots where no leaves were added. All plots received the same amount of 10-10-10 fertilizer applied at the recommended rate for vegetable production (1300 lbs/A). In 2007, lettuce yields were virtually the same for all the treatments with heads averaging 1.5 lbs from plots amended with either oak or maple leaves compared to 1.4 lbs from the control plots. The plots amended with oak leaves averaged the greatest pepper yields (6.8 lbs/plant) compared to plots ame nded with maple leaves (6.0 lbs/plant) or the unamended control (5.6 lbs/plant). Plots amended w ith maple leaves averaged the greatest leek yields (9.3 oz/plant) compared to (7.6 lbs/plot) or oa k leaves (6.1 lbs/plot ). It appears that applications of oak or maple leaves are not very deleterious to vegetable production but the experiment will be continued to determine the effect of repeated applications of oak or maple leaves. Heirloom Tomato Trials: Interest and sales of heirloom tomato es have increased dramatically in the past 10 years. More and more consumers are willing to forego appearance for that real old- fashioned tomato taste. Knowledge of high-yieldi ng cultivars and cultural details would benefit growers, especially those who serve inner city consumers who purchase thes e vegetables at local farmers markets throughout the Northeast. Howe ver, growing heirloom tomatoes can be a challenge. Heirlooms tend to have poor diseas e resistance and have lo wer yields when to compared to hybrid tomatoes. They are also mo re susceptible to cracking due to their tender The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 135 skin. In 2007, Dr. Abigail A. Maynard evaluated ten cultivars of ear ly maturing ethnic heirloom tomatoes for yield and quality at Windsor and Mt. Carmel. Impact: Yields of Thessaloniki and Bloody Butcher were greatest (17 and 13 lbs/plant, respectively) with Stupice averaging 12 lbs/pl ant. At a retail price of $1.99/lb, there is a potential crop value of over $122,000/A. The lo ng-term benefits include an additional product and revenue for growers who attend fa rmers markets or have their own roadside stands. Potted plants can be watered by sub-irrigation or ebb and flood watering, whereby water is supplied through the base of the pot by flooding the bench or floor on which the pots sit. Ebb and flood watering combats the waste of water and fertilizer in traditional over head watering systems used in greenhouses for production of potted ornamental plants. All of the water that is not ta ken up by plants is recycled to a reservoir for use in the next watering cycle. Effect of Recycling Compared to Discharge of Nutrient Solution Used to Produce Greenhouse Tomato: In 2006 and 2007, Dr. Martin P.N. Gent compared two systems for growing greenhouse tomato in rock wool medium supplied with a complete nutrient solution. In one system, all solution drained from the pl ants was recycled to water the plants again. In the other, all solution drained from the plants was discarded. There was a difference in the drained solutions that was most obvious after one mont h of recycling. Typically, the transition from vegetative to fruit growth, which coincides with wa rm season, resulted in over-supply of nitrate, potassium and other nutrients. It took a longe r time to return the solution to an optimal composition with recycled compared to disc harged solution. There was little effect on composition of tomato fruit, despite sometimes large differences in composition of nutrient solution. Total yield, fruit size and frequency of defects of the fruit varied among the three cultivars used in these trials, and the cultivars tended to diffe r in response to recycling. Re- selection of cultivars may be necessary if recycling becomes required or a more popular option for greenhouse tomato production. Recycling nutrient solution, or reuse of solution after it has once been used to water plants, has become the preferred legislativ e solution to prevent ground wate r pollution due to the use of fertilizer in intensive agricult ural production. Subtle and gradua l changes in nutrient solutions could ultimately have deleterious effects on plan t growth, product quality , and the dietary value of vegetables. We found that these changes do not necessarily lead to lowe r yield or deleterious changes in composition of vegetables. 136 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Impact: There are many growers in Connecticut who use greenhouses to grow plants in pots or troughs filled with ar tificial medium using a regular supply of nutrient solution to promote rapid growth of the plants. While there are more than 50 growers who use greenhouses to grow tomatoes for direct retai l to consumers from farm stands, none of them recycle used nutrient solution. Adoption of this new technology will enhance water quality by reducing the quantity of nut rients that reach our aquifers. Winegrape growers and Farm Wineries face several challenges. Farm Wineries are required to grow a minimum of 25% of the fruit in their total output, but are having trouble meeting this standard. Consecutive very cold winters in 2003 and 2004 resulted in significant plant loss on less cold hardy cultivars, and have driven up prices for purchasing Connecticut and out-of-state fruit. Little information is available to growers regarding cultural information for growing more cold-hardy and disease resistant hybrid cultivars in the state. Disease management is critical during the growing season due to Connecticut's warm, humid summers. The i ndustry requires increased production via better manageme nt practices in existing vineyards and improved variety selection in newly planted vineyards. Winegrapes : Studies were initiated by Dr. William R. Nail in 2004-2008 to help determine cu ltural practices for growing high quality winegrapes profitably in Connecticut. The wine grape industry in C onnecticut is rapidly expanding. The first Farm Winery in the state opened in 1979, and there ar e currently 22 wineries with a Farm or Commercial Winery license, with 2 or 3 more sc heduled to open in the foreseeable future. The existence of these wineries adds substantially to local economies, as local restaurants, hotels, and other establishments receive increased business due to their proximity. The Connecticut Wine Trail brochure, published by the Connecticut Vine yard and Winery Association, is the most popular brochure in Department of Tourism travel offices. Cultural practices in Vitis vinifera : Dr. Nail established a planting of 288 Pinot Gris vines at Lockwood Farm in summer 2004. Two different rootstocks were used: 3309C, the most commonly planted rootstock, and 101-14, which may tend to ripen fruit earlier and have better tolerance to severe winter freezes. The firs t full crop was harvested in 2007, and cultural experiments will be initiated to determine better strategies for optimum yield and fruit quality. Impact: Vines grafted to 101-14 rootstock ha d 32% less mortality due to winter freeze damage than those grafted to 3309C. Planting vines on rootstocks mo re resistant to winter damage can result in savings of $7.40 for each year of lost production per vine, plus $3.50 replacement cost plus labor involved in remov ing diseased vines and replanting. Vines will The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 137 be monitored for several years to observe incidence and severity of crown gall, whose symptoms sometimes do not appear until one to two years after a significant freeze event. Cultural methods for reducing cluster compactness : Harvest rots are a major problem if climactic conditions are favorable for disease de velopment between veraison and harvest. Based on field tests, the increased susceptibility of ti ght-clustered cultivars a nd clones is a result of cluster compactness rather than being geneti c in nature. Reducing photosynthesis by leaf removal at bloom has been shown to reduce fruit se t, resulting in looser clusters. However, since the leaves are permanently removed, this reduc tion in photosynthesis can have negative consequences for bud fruitfulness in the subseque nt growing season. Studies with the herbicide Terbacil have shown that by temporarily reducing photosynthesis, fruit set can be reduced with no long-term negative consequences. Terbacil is not labeled for such a use, and if it were, it is extremely unlikely that a grower would confidently apply an herb icide to their crop. JMS Stylet oil is labeled for use on grapes as a fungicide and insecticide, and is used by many growers, especially organic ones. It has been shown to slightly reduce photosynthesis, but can result in lower fruit soluble solids if over applied. Dr. Nail applied JMS Stylet oil at trace bloom in 2006 through 2008 to selected Pinot Gris vines. Single leaf photosynthesis measurements were made before and after application. Flower primordia on clusters opposite measured leaves were counted. Photosynthesis was reduced by an average of 18% the day after oil application compared to vines sp rayed with water only, and fruit set on treated vines was reduced by an average of 20%. The experiment will be continued through pruning in spring of 2009 to ensure that there are no negative effects of this practice. Effects of graft union height : Freeze damage to grafted grapevines frequently occurs at the graft union, which is typically very close to the ground. Crown gall frequently occurs on freeze- damaged vines, although symptoms may not appear for one or two years after the freeze event. Elevating the height of the graft union may result in le ss injury. Chardonnay clone 96 budwood was grafted onto 3309C rootstock at standard height and 26 inches higher in 2006, and the vines were transplanted in spring 2007 to vineyards at Lockwood Farm and Westport, Massachusetts. Vines will be evaluated for vine performance, winter survival, and crown gall incidence and severity in subsequent years. Impact: Vines with crown gall typically requi re replacement. Vines requiring replacement result in average losses of $7.40 per year for three years due to crop loss, $3.50 for replacement vines, plus labor in removing in fected vines and replanting. High-grafted vines may result in significant reduction in such losses, which would be approximately $2,070 plus labor per acre for each 10% of vine mort ality. Funding for this project was obtained from the Viticulture Consortium East for 2006 and 2008. 138 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Grapevines in most older vineyards in Connectic ut are planted on six foot spacing and trained to a vertically shoot positioned syst em. This has generally worked we ll for most vinifera cultivars and some hybrids. Recently released hybrid culti vars that are rapidly finding favor frequently have different growth habits that make them uns uitable for this traditional spacing and training. Within-row spacing of grapevines in the vineyard is one of the most critical decisions to be made at planting. Too close spacing results in excessi ve competition and excessive vegetative growth, leading to reduced yields of poor quality fru it. Spacing that is too far apart results in unproductive utilization of valu able vineyard space. The c hoice of spacing is permanent; however, errors made at planting can sometimes be partially remedied by dividing the canopy to accommodate vine growth. Divided canopies can increase yield pe r foot of row length, but are more difficult and labor-intensive to establish and maintain. To evaluate spacing and traini ng systems for new cultivars, Dr. William R. Nail established a new planting of the hybrid cultivars St. Croix, Ca yuga White, and Traminette in May, 2005 at a private grower's vineyard in Wallingford. St . Croix and Cayuga White are among the most widely planted red and white cultiv ars, respectively, in the state, and Traminette is a relatively new release from the Cornell breeding program which shows much promise. Hybrid cultivars have different growth habits and management issu es than vinifera cultivars, which may involve fundamental issues both before a nd after planting. Plants of all th ree cultivars were planted at 6 and 8 foot spacings, and will be grown on different training systems: low wire, Vertically Shoot Positioned (VSP), Hudson River Umbrella (HRU ), Geneva Double Curtain (GDC), and a vertically divided canopy system such as Sco tt Henry. Those on 6 foot spacing will also be pruned to both cane and cordon systems. Impact: The results of this study will allow both new and existing growers to help maximize their production, as well as possibly demonstr ating that some systems are not efficient in Connecticut. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 139 Pruning systems : Most grapevines in Connecticut have traditionally been cane-pruned. Cane pruning requires skilled labor, which is increas ingly in short supply. Spur pruning to a cordon system requires less skilled labor and lends itself to mechanization. A planting of Seyval Blanc, Chambourcin, Villard Blanc, and Villard Noir at Lockwood Farm was rejuvenated in 2004, and vines were either cordon or cane pruned in 2005 through 2008 to compare the relative efficiencies of these pruning methods. Yield and fruit quality parameters were determined beginning in the 2005 harvest season at Lockwood Farm. Impact: Cordon pruning is a viable alternativ e to the cane pruning method used in most Connecticut vineyards. Skilled labor costs, es sential to cane pruning, are approximately 30% higher than unskilled labor costs. Of e qual importance is the increasing unavailability of skilled labor. Vines will be monitored th rough the 2008 growing season to determine if there are differences in long-term vegetative or fruit quality parameters that may influence a grower's decision. Cultivar and clonal evaluation : Beginning in 2004 , Dr. William R. Nail has evaluated previously established experime ntal plots at Lockwood Farm, the Valley Laboratory, and two private grower's vineyards. The planting at Lo ckwood Farm contains onl y hybrid cultivars. One private vineyard was established to compare the Vitis vinifera cultivars Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon. The plots at the Valley Laboratory and the se cond private vineyard compared different V. vinifera and hybrid cultivars. Data from these vineyards will continue to be collected through the 2008 growing season at Lockwood Farm and the private vineyard in Shelton. In each year, Riesling fr uit was considerably less mature at harvest than any other white variety, indicating the need to harvest it later than other cultivars or, if all cultivars are treated the same, to consider not planting it. Dr. Nail established new cultivar trials at Lockw ood Farm and the Valley Laboratory in spring, 2008 to compare new cultivars of V. vinifera and hybrids to more establ ished cultivars. There are 15 hybrid cultivars and 9 vinifera cultivars in th e trial at Lockwood Farm, and 7 hybrid cultivars at the Valley Laboratory. This st udy is coordinated with research ers from other states throughout the country as NE-1020: Multi-Sta te Evaluation of Winegrape Cultivars and Clones. This project should help answer the questions \"What are the cr iteria for selecting a pa rticular variety?\" and \"What cultivar(s) is (are) most suited to my situation?\" Cabernet Sauvignon has displayed high vine mortal ity and poor fruit quality due to lack of maturity. Growers have generally agreed that this cultivar is unsuitable for Connecticut conditions, and no significant new plantings are be ing established. Cabern et Franc and Merlot both produced good quality fruit, although yields in Merlot were slightly lower (4.2 vs. 4.0 tons/acre, respectively). While there have sometimes been differences among clone and rootstock performance, growing s eason effects are greater. At th e Valley Laboratory and at the second private vineyard, white hybrid cultivars sli ghtly outyielded most white vinifera cultivars, at 5.5 vs. 4.7 tons/acre There were no significan t differences between hyb rid and vinifera red cultivars. 140 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Impact: The research suggests that vinifera cult ivars are a viable option for vineyards not susceptible to winter freeze damage, as prices for vinifera average $1,380/ton vs $700/ton for hybrids. Connecticut's landscape is a quilt of forests, farms, towns, and cities. Scientists in the Department of Forestry and Horticulture are studying the factors that influence both forest and farm productivity, including novel specialty crops, and the effect of the growing deer population on natural and managed landscapes. Connecticut ha s a strong link to the forest. Approximately 60% of Connecticut's land area is classified as forest. In addition to valuable non-commodity amenities (watershed protection, wildlife habita t, passive recreation), the forests are a valuab le part of the local economy. Connecticut has a $500 million wood pr oduct industry of 350 firms that provide employment to 3,600 loggers, millworkers, and others. Crop-tree management: Black birch ( Betula lenta L.) has become an increasingly important component of northeastern forests in recent decades. Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward continued a study of crop tree management for black birch begun in 19 96-1997. This was a cooperative study with CT DEP-Division of Forestry, North east Utilities, Regional Water Authority, and the Metropolitan District Commission. Plots were established in five stands to examine diameter and volume growth response of black birch to crop-tree release. The stands were from 20-99 years-old, and mean crop-tree diameters ranged from 4.8 to 13.8 inches. Growth of crop-trees was monitored for eight years. Over the eight-year period, diamet er and volume growth of completely released poles (4.6-10.5 inches diameter) was twice that of unreleased pol es. Increased growth was noted the first year after release and showed no indication of decreasing after eight years. Release did not affect diameter growth of small sawtimbe r crop-trees (10.6-13.5 inches diameter) until the third year after release. However, after eight y ears, diameter and volume growth was nearly forty percent greater than for unreleased trees. Release had negligible effect on diameter and volume growth of medium sawtimber crop- trees (> 13.5 inches diameter). Impact: Initiating crop-tree management in young stands of black birch poles (mean diameter of upper canopy trees of 4.5 inch es) would reduce by nearly 50% the time required to grow those trees to diameters of 13.5 inches., i.e., harvested volume could be nearly doubled with intensive management . The current high demand for firewood has made this management practice commercially feasible and was therefore highlighted at a field meeting in spring 2008 attended by prof essional foresters fr om Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York wh ose agencies collectiv ely manage over 500,000 acres. Two major threats to natural preserves and ma naged forests are exotic plant species and browsing by overabundant white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ). While Japanese Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 141 (Berberis thunbergii DC) has been widely reported in the popular literature to \"displace\" native plants, few studies directly examined the in fluence of alien inva sive shrubs on native communities. There have been no studies to determine if native species were displaced by the invasive species, or conversel y, if another factor (e.g., deer br owse) removed the native species and invasive species expl oited the open habitat. Deer Repellent Study : Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward and Dr. Scott C. Williams continued a deer repellent trial that was begun in spring 2006 at two different sites within Connecticut. Deer repellents are most often strong and/or foul-smelling agents that are applied directly to plants in an attempt to prevent deer from browsing a nd ultimately damaging them. Repellents work in different ways: some make the animal nauseous, ot hers taste very hot or bitter, while others are supposed to invoke fear. Ten differe nt repellent formulations are being tested: Chew Nott\u00ae, Deer Away\u00ae, Big Hinder\u00ae, Repellex\u00ae systemic tablets, and coyot e urine. Other repellent trials have been completed, but none as extensive with such a vari ed array of repellent types. At both sites, Windsor and Woodbridge, 144 yews ( Taxus ) were planted in 2006. Twelve yews at each site received one of twelve treatments (the ten differe nt repellents, a fence, and untreated control). Manufactures instructions for repellent appli cation are being followed. The yews have been harvested, stripped of their needles, stems cut up, and dried in a large ove n in order to attain accurate dry weight biomass. Preliminary analys es indicate that there are differences in the effectiveness of the twelve different treatments. Impact: Deer browsing costs the Connecticut nursery industry $3-4 million annually in direct damages, control measures, and lost sa les. Several products appear effective and their use could decrease annual deer browse damage by $300,000 or more. Japanese barberry control : Japanese barberry has spread beyond manicured landscapes and is naturalized in at least twenty-four eastern stat es. Throughout the region, especially where white-taile d deer populations are high, dense barberry stands devel op in the forest understory. These dense barberry stands are associated with a paucity of both tree regeneration and herbaceous plants. Barberry may alter nitrogen cycling and thereby affect soil biota. A Maine study found black-legged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) populations were twice as high under barberry as in adjacent forests. As black-legged ticks are associated with several diseases including Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and human babesiosis, extensive barberry infestati ons may have an indirect, adverse effect on human health. Drs. Jeffrey S. Ward and Scott C. Williams continued their studies of alternative methods to control Japanese barberry begun in 2006. This research both ev aluated the effectiveness and relative costs among treatment combinations to control Japanese barberry, and by monitoring 142 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 individual clumps across a range of size classe s, assessed whether treatment prescriptions are dependent on clump size. Two study areas were established on a Regional Water Authority (RWA) watershed in North Branford, CT. Two study areas were established on the Centennial Watershed State Forest in Redding, CT that is jointly managed by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, The Nature Conservancy, and the Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut. One study area was established on The Nature Conser vancy lands in Salisbury, CT. The sixth study area was established in Storrs, CT on the Univers ity of Connecticut Experiment Forest. All study areas have extensive stands of mature Japanese barberry. The three initial treatments to reduce the size of the established barberry clumps in spring 2007 were: prescribed burning, mechanical mowing w ith a drum chopper, and mechanical mowing with a brush saw. Barberry clumps missed by the drum chopper (adjacent to trees, stone walls, or large rocks) were cut with a brush saw. The second, follow-up treatments for the sprouts that developed after the initial treatments in July 2007 included: foliar application of herbicid e (triclopyr and glyphosate), directed flame (propane torc h), and no follow-up treatment (control). Each follow-up treatment was applied over each initial treatment, i.e., separate sections of drum chopped areas were treated with triclopyr, gl yphosate, propane torch, or left untreated. Per company policy, herbicides were not tested at RWA. Therefore, these follow-up treatments were used at RWA: directed flame (propane to rch) during initial spring flush (l ate May), directed flame after initial flush completed (early July), directed fl ame during initial spring flush and again in late July. All initial treatments were equa lly effective in reducing clum p size. Mortality differed among follow-up treatments: untreated controls (14%), directed flame (40%), and herbicide (93%). Surviving clumps having no follow-up treatment rec overed to half of their original size by the end of the growing season. Size of surviving clumps did not differ am ong the other follow-up treatments and averaged 20% of the original size . Excellent control of Japanese barberry can be achieved using either propane torches or herb icides. Propane torches provide an organic alternative where in parks, natu re preserves, or forests where herbicide use is restricted and where barberry infestations are still light. Impact: Developing cost-effective method of controlling Japanese barberry will allow large land owners to maximize the area treated each year. This research is partly funded by Regional Water Authority, Aquarion Water Company, and The Nature Conservancy. They collectively manage over 50,000 acres that include extensive areas of barberry. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 143 Propane torches have been purchased to control barberry on lands managed by Connecticut DEP-Wildlife Division (22,000 ac res), Colebrook Land Conservancy (566 acres), Northern Connecticut Land Trust (435 acres), New Hartford Conservation Commission (171 acres), and numerous privat e forest owners. Requests for information about this technique also have been receive d from the USDA Forest Service (Pennsylvania and New Hampshire), NRCS (Connecticut an d Rhode Island), New York City - DEP Bureau of Water Supply, Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge (Maine), Anacostia Watershed Society (Maryland), private natura l resource managers, an d the general public. Deer Browse Exclosure Study : One method to study the impact of deer on natural ecosystems is to compare growth rates and species diversity of vegetation protected from white-tailed deer browse to unprotected plots. Dr. Scott C. Williams is collecting vegetation da ta within sixteen deer exclosures and sixteen adja cent control plots th roughout the state. Deer exclosures prevent deer from accessing vegetation within. Growth rate s and species diversity of enclosed vegetation are compared with that of an adjacent control plot, where deer have access to vegetation. The project is a collaborative effort with The Natu re Conservancy to maintain and sample twelve deer exclosures, four each at Burnham Brook Pr eserve in East Haddam, the Bingham Easement also in East Haddam, and Devil's Den Preserve in Weston. We are also including four of our own exclosures on South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority property in North Branford. Data analysis for fall 2005, spri ng 2006, fall 2006, spring 2007, fall 2007, and spring 2008 sampling periods indicate that herbaceous cover within exclosures is greater than control plots. Density of tree seedlings at least two feet tall is twice as high with in exclosures compared to control plots. All locations will be resa mpled for both woody and herbaceous vegetation in late summer 2008. Results from this study will re veal plant species comp osition and growth rates in the absence of deer. Impact: Overabundant white-tailed deer are negatively impacting forest health by altering species composition due to selective and over-br owsing habits. Over time, this process will significantly reduce stand and land val ues of forestlands in Connecticut. Interaction of Deer Browse and Barberry Infestations : The Japanese barberry ( Berberis thunbergii ) control study provided the uni que opportunity to superimpos e, at minimal expense, a study examining the separate and interactive effect s of deer browsing and alien invasive species on native herbaceous vegetation and tree regene ration. At the North Br anford, Redding, and Storrs study areas, Dr. Williams and Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward erected deer exclosures in May 2007 on plots that were treated with the Fecon mowe r, plots treated with the Fecon mower with propane torch follow-up, and on plots where the ba rberry was not treated. Each of the three treatments have an adjacent unfenced plot. For each treatment (total of six), regeneration and herbaceous vegetation was sampled using ten 4-m2 circular plots insi de and outside the exclosures (sixty plots total) in spring 2008. Ve getation will be contin ually sampled in early spring and late summer for multiple growing se asons. This study will determine whether it is white-tailed deer, Japanese barberry, both, or neither limiting nativ e species regeneration throughout Connecticut. Impact: Both Japanese barberry and white-ta iled deer are invasive species that have detrimental impacts on Connecticut's native forested ecosystems. A better understanding 144 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 of the interaction between the two species ca n be used to promote improved forest health throughout the State. Japanese Barberry Infestations as a Refuge for Blacklegged Ticks and White-Footed tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) populations were twice as abundant in barberry infestations as adjacent forests. Drs. Williams and Ward also suspected that barberry infestations would harbor Peromyscus leucopus ) due to protection from both terrestrial and avian predators. Because white-footed mice are the primary reservoir for Borrelia burgdorferi , the causal agent of Lyme disease in humans, there is the possibility th at ticks found in barberry infestations would have higher infection rates. To investigate these hypotheses, mouse trapping grids (20 stations) were established each in areas of no barberry, areas where ba rberry was controlled, and areas of full barberry (60 total) at each of three locations throughout Connecticut (North Branford, Redding, and Storrs). All locations were trapped five times in summer 2007 resulting in 269 captures of 149 unique mice over 900 trap nights. The same areas were also sampled for adul t and nymphal ticks in the fall of 2007 and spring/early summer of 2008 using standard flag ging techniques. Thus far, mouse abundances appear to be nearly the same in each of the three treatment areas, but mean larval ticks/mouse were higher in full barb erry infestations ticks/mouse) than in controlled or areas of no barberry ( 7 ticks/mouse). Adult tick densities were also highly correlated with Japanese barberry abundance. Blood samples taken from mice are currently being analyzed in Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli's serology laboratory for th e presence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi as well as Babesia microti , of human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Ticks gathered from plots are currently being tested for the presence of B. burgdorferi . Mouse trapping and tick sampling efforts will continue for severa l more years to monitor long-term effects as generational turnover will result in a more accu rate determination of the full effects of controlling Japanese barberry. A manuscript summari zing this research will be completed by fall 2008. Impact: Japanese barberry is an exotic invas ive plant that overwhelms the forest shrub layer and virtually eliminates other native plants. In addition, it harbors increased abundances of blacklegged ticks and diseases that can be tran smitted to humans. Managing barberry infestations can improve the health of forests and the public citizens of the State of Connecticut.

DEPARTMENT OF PLANT PATHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY The Department of Plant Pathology and Ec ology conducts resear ch on the biology and ecology of plant pathogens and interactions betw een plants, pathogens, and the environment. Staff members also diagnose plant health problem s for our stakeholders. Our mission is to 146 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 manage plant health problems using innovative me thods to protect the environment, ensure a safe food supply, and maintain a healthy landscape for Connecticut. Scientists in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology are involved in both service and research activities . Our service efforts focus on the diagnos is of plant health problems for all Connecticut residents, incl uding homeowners, plant care professionals (e.g., arborists, landscapers, garden centers), and commercial growers (e.g., gr eenhouse, vegetable, nursery, orchard, and vineyard crops). We work closely with professionals and homeowners to develop disease management programs that require minimal use of pesticides and are compatible with the environment. The Department of Plant Pathol ogy and Ecology has an active outreach program, which offers numerous fact sheets, web-base d information, workshops, and presentations for grower groups, garden and horticultural clubs , special interest groups, and students. Our research efforts include original , basic investigations in many ar eas of plant pathology including the ecology and genetics of pl ant pathogens, new and emerging diseases, and models for predicting the spread of plant pa thogens. These studies focus on, but are not limited to, the needs of Connecticut stakeholders. In December 2007, Dr. Botond Balogh joined the department as the plant pathologist responsible for the Plant Disease Information Office. His expertise in bacteriology and biological control using bacteri ophages will enhance the department 's capabilities in working with this important group of pathogens.

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Sudden Vegetation Dieback In the summer and fall of 2002, large areas of emergent vegetation at several sites along Long Island Sound were observed dead. Th e loss was mostly restricted to Spartina alterniflora The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 147 along creek banks in the low marsh. The phenom enon is called Sudden Vegetation Dieback (SVD), formerly called Sudden Wetland Dieback. Dr. Wade Elmer has been investigating SVD and has conducted surveys along Long Island So und salt marshes. In 2007, he found that S. alterniflora plants in SVD sites had a higher incidence of Fusarium spp. colonizing the leaves, stems, and roots than plants from healthy marshe s. Initial surveys in 2008 have confirmed these findings. To assess the role of Fusarium pathogens in SVD, over 200 isolates of Fusarium spp. were collected from plants in SVD sites from Ma ine to Virginia and place d in storage. Over 100 isolates were tested for pathogeni city by wound-inoculating stems of S. alterniflora and measuring the resulting lesions. The isolates were divided into two groups based on their pathogenicity (lesion length) and morphology (spore shape and ontogeny). In collaboration with Dr. Marra , 22 pathogenic isolates and 18 nonpat hogenic isolates were analyzed phylogenetically by aligning partia the translati on elongation factor 1-alpha, calmodulin, and beta-tubulin genes. With each ge ne sequence, pathogens clustered together with minimal diversity suggesting they may com pose one closely related species complex. Nonpathogens also clustered together with minima l genetic variation. A bl ast query to the NCBI database did not match either of these species , suggesting a formal de scription of these two species is warranted. Wade Elmer sampling Spartina alterniflora along creek banks exhibiting Sudden Vegetation Dieback (SVD). Several stress studies were established in the greenhouse to determine the role of drought, normal irrigation, or flooding on Fusarium spp. infection of S. alterniflora. There was no interaction between the irriga tion treatments and Fusarium inoculation, but inoculation consistently reduced plant growth and increased the percentage of root lesions. Plants placed under drought conditions suffered the most and the majority of the ones that were inoculated with Fusarium had died. When S. alterniflora plants were irrigated with increasing saline treatments (0, 0.5X, X, or 2X X = 35 ppt NaCl or 55 ds/m]), ther e was little effect of Fusarium on plant health, but the high rates of salinity were toxic. These findings support the observation that drought may be the predisposing stressor in SVD. Future studies will examine the interaction of drought and salin ity on Fusarium infection. 148 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Impact : Loss of wetland flora like Spartina has drastic implications for coastal ecology and marine life, shellfish industries, and prope rty values. These findings suggest that Fusarium spp. could be contributing to SVD by limiting plant gr owth and vigor during periods of drought. Biocontrol with earthworms Earthworm densities have been regarded as re liable indicators of soil health, but their role in suppression of plant disease has not received much attention. Dr. Elmer conducted a series of greenhouse studies where soils infested with soilborne pathogens were augmented with earthworms ( Lumbricus terrestris) and then planted with suscep tible asparagus, eggplants, and tomatoes. In each host-disease system, earthwo rm activity was associated with 60-80% more growth and 50-70% less disease. Soil dilutions on selective medi a revealed that densities of fluorescent pseudomonads and filamentous actin omycetes were consistently higher in rhizosphere soils augmented with earthworms. For the third year, Dr. Elmer has conducted field studies with eggplants grown in soil infested with Verticillium dahliae . In two of the three years, e ggplant yields were increased in plots augmented with earthworms. In all three y ears, disease severity wa s reduced in plots where earthworms were added. We hypothe sized that disease suppression was a result of biological activity, but cannot exclude the ro le of increased fertility. Impact: These studies suggest that strategies to increase earthworm densities in soil will improve soil health and s uppress soilborne diseases. Fusarium ecology on corn stubble A long-term study on the incidence of Fusarium graminearum , a fungus that produces carcinogenic mycotoxins in grain, was continued by Dr. Elmer in 2007-2008. Assays were done in collaboration with Drs. Kerry O'Donnell and Todd Ward of th e NCAUR of USDA ARS in Peoria. They found that a unique chemot ype of the fungus called 3-ADON was found in Connecticut cornfields in 18, 21, and 19% of the isolates for 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. The 3-ADON chemotype produces a more toxic mycotoxin than the more common chemotype called 15-ADON. In 2007, the percentage of 3- ADON chemotypes dropped to only 1.6%. It is not known if this represents a sampling error or if the reduction is an indication of the inability of this chemotype to survive in C onnecticut's cornfields. To addr ess this, over 440 pieces of corn stubble were assayed in 2008 from three cornfi elds in northeastern Connecticut. Over 80 colonies of F. graminearum were recovered, which represen ted 31, 16, and 15% of the total colonies from each of the three sampled fields, respectively. In cooperation with Dr. Marra , every isolate will be assayed using PCR to determine its chemotype and to gain a more accurate estimation of the incidence of the 3-ADON chemotype. Impact: Understanding the incidence and relative distribution of the 3-ADON isolates of Fusarium graminearum will assist us in predicting whether or not this more toxic chemotype is increasing in Connecticut. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 149 Ornamental disease research Fusarium corm rot of gladiolus corm rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. gladioli and is the most destructive root disease of gladiolus. Previous research by Dr. Elmer found that a 20 min soak of corms in 50 ppm of Actigard 50 WP provided season- long suppression of Fusarium In addition, we tested a nonpathogenic Fusarium oxysporum strain called CS-20 as a corm soak. We found that the CS-20 strains provided the same level of protection as Actigard 50 WP. The study is currently being repeated. Impact : Because Fusarium corm rot is extremely difficult to control, th e strategy of soaking corms for 20 min with Actigard 50 WP may provid e an economically efficient management tool resulting in minimal chemical c ontact and reduced exposure to th e environment. Furthermore, the development of a nonpathogenic strain of F. oxysporum may provide another tool for fighting Fusarium corm rot on gladiolus. Demonstration of the ability Fusarium oxysporum strain CS-20 to suppress Fusarium corm rot of gladio lus (plant on left) when compared with the control (plant on right). Fusarium wilt of Coreopsis verticillata In the summer of 2006, Fusarium wilt of Coreopsis verticillata cv. Moonbeam was first reported by Dr. Elmer and colleagues at Cornell Universit y, Pennsylvania State University, and Purdue University. The causal agent was identified as F. oxysporum . Given the recent appearance of this serious disease and the potential for widespread distribution via the horticultural trade, we investigated the host ra nge of the pathogen. No wilt symptoms or reductions in dry weight were observed in 3 cultiv ars of aster, 8 cultivars of chrysanthemum, and one cultivar of echinacea when compared to controls in greenhouse tests. Similarly, no symptoms were observed on agerat um, basil, eggplant, gomphrena, scabiosa, or snapdragon. In contrast, symptoms of stunting, wilt, and va scular discoloration were observed only on C. verticillata and C. lanceolata. Other strains of F. oxysporum that were pathogenic on other asters, such as China aster, chrysanthemum, and dianthus, were avirulent on coreopsis. To assess the level of genetic dive rsity in the pathogen, the tef- gene genealogy from 17 F. 150 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 oxysporum isolates was developed in cluding isolates from other formae speciales of F. oxysporum . All of the coreopsis isolates were clos ely related and placed in a single distinct group within Clade 2 of the F. oxysporum species complex, indicati ng that host specialization might have occurred from a single ancestor. Impact : Because of the popularity of th is coreopsis cultivar, this disease has the potential to cause significant economic loss in nurseries and landscape businesse s. Careful surveillance of imported coreopsis plants is warranted. These data also suggest that a forma specialis designation may be applicable to this pathoge n. We have proposed the pathogen be called F. oxysporum f. research on Perennial Canker (also known as Neonectria canker) focuses on the ecology and genetics of the fungal pathogen, Neonectria ditissima, with the goal of gaining a fuller understanding of the life history, evoluti on, and population dynamics of the organism and its interactions with its hosts, particularly black birch ( Betula lenta ). Fundamental knowledge of the natural history of N. ditissima is lacking, yet is an esse ntial prerequisite to the development of an effective control strategy fo r Perennial Canker. To that end, Dr. Marra's research program has developed field techniques and laboratory tools ne cessary to undertake a study of this organism and the disease it causes, focusing particularly on the use of classical and molecular genetics to elucidate mating structur e and the ecology of spor e dispersal. Cultures obtained from infected bark and wood from vari ous parts of Connecticut and the eastern United States have been grown to pure culture and analyzed microscopically for key morphological features. DNA obtained from cultures is being analyzed using genetic markers in order to determine (1) if fruiting bodies are the result of outcrossing or self-fertiliza tion, and (2) if outcrossed, the extent to which they are inbred or outbred. Understandi ng this aspect of the mating system will shed light on the fungus' dispersal patterns, a critical precedent to the development of a biocontrol program. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 151 N. ditissima often causes multiple cankers on black birch, running the length of the stem. Perithecia, the fruiting bodies of N. ditissima , are visible near canker margins on black birch bark. Two categories of molecular genetic marker s are now being used in the laboratory. Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers have the advantage of revealing an abundance of polymorphic sites in DNA with relativel y small effort. Two sets of AFLP primers have already identified approximately 60 marker s that are highly polymorphic. AFLP markers have the disadvantages of being dominant (pol ymorphisms are scored as presence versus absence) and anonymous (they cann ot be studied or treated indi vidually, and determining their location in the genome is not trivial). Nonethel ess, they permit testing hypotheses at a gross scale, and help direct research using more labor-i ntensive markers such as microsatellites, which constitute the second type of marker developed in Dr. Marra's lab, and which were the focus of marker development over the past year. Micr osatellites are chains of repeating DNA motifs (e.g., acgacgacgacgacg) found throughout the genome s of most eukaryotes ; variation in the number of motif repeats at a mi crosatellite locus underl ies the length differences among alleles. 152 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Unlike AFLPs, microsatellites are always codominant - i.e., each allele is uniquely identified by its length - and their location in the genome is anchored by unique DNA sequences flanking them. Dr. Marra, with the assistance of Mr. Jason Corwin , has succeeded in identifying 14 microsatellite loci that are pol ymorphic and informative; 11 of these have been demonstrated to be polymorphic within a single Connecticut population sample of 38 isolates, from West Rock Ridge State Park (WRRSP). The number of alle les at each locus segr egating among the WRRSP isolates ranged from 2 to 12. During the course of isolating and analyzing isolates from WRRSP, Dr. Marra identified two Neonectria species, N. discophora and N. coronata . Although both are considered tropical species, N. discophora has been identified previously, albeit rarely, in the United States, whereas the identification of N. coronata in Connecticut represents the fi rst report of this fungus outside the tropics. Impact: Due to its increasing abundance in Conn ecticut, black birch is a tree of growing importance and concern. Although trees infected with Perennial Canker can persist for decades, the extensive scarring caused by the cankers renders them of little value for lumber or veneer. Our efforts to more fully understand the biology and natural history of N. ditissima will contribute to the identification and ut ilization of control strategies. Ramorum Blight/ Phytophthora ramorum Drs. Marra and Douglas have been supervising the implementation of USDA-mandated assays for detection of Phytophthora ramorum on nursery material shipped from California, Oregon, or Washington. Nursery surv eys are conducted in cooperation with Dr. Victoria Smith and state inspectors. These assays have been carried out prin cipally by technician Jason Corwin . The process begins a serolo gical test called ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), which detects all Phytophthora species. If a sample tests positive by ELISA, DNA is extracted from it and then analyzed for P. ramorum -specific nucleotide sequences using nested PCR assays. The new Molecular Plant Diagnostics Laborat ory was given Provision al Approval Status for P. ramorum by APHIS-PPQ and, in February of 2008, Mr. Corwin was certified in the 2008 Proficiency Testing Program for c onventional and realtime PCR. Impact : Phytophthora ramorum is a pathogen of regulatory im portance and a growing concern in Connecticut because of the numerous species of plants and trees common in Connecticut that are known or suspected hosts. Much of this co ncern centers on the poten tial impact of this disease on Connecticut's significan t nursery industry (over $1 b illion in annual production) and on our forests and landscapes, which also contribu te significantly to the state's economy. Given that the eastern United States, including Conn ecticut, is considered at high risk for P. ramorum , based on host distribution and climate, concern over the possible acciden tal introduction of the pathogen into the environment is warranted. Additionally, the molecular diagnostic techniques being used and under development at the Station w ill continue to enhance the disease diagnostics services provided to Conn ecticut's stakeholders. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 153 Pestalotiopsis from tree peonies Dr. Marra has isolated the ascomycete, Pestalotiopsis paeoniicola , from a tree peony obtained from a Connecticut grow er. Dr. Marra was assisted by Dr. DeWei Li in the identification of this species, a pathogen of tree peony that has never been reported outside of China. Drs. Marra and Li have confirmed both the identity and pathoge nicity of the isolate through the completion of Koch's Postulates. Integrated Pest Management fo r Wine Grapes in New England The vineyard industry in southern New Engla nd has doubled in the last seven years. In 2008, there will be about 750 acres planted to wine grapes on 80-85 farms throughout Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. There are 63 commercial wineries with projected 2008 annual sales of $17-$20 million, wh ich produce about three quarters of a million gallons of wine. Wine trails in southern Ne w England connect many of the wineries and have been successful in increasing cultural diversit y by infusing much-needed money into many rural communities. In some cases, vineyards provide an alternative, direct-sales opportunity for existing farms, while in others the vineyards represent new agricultural enterprises. Wine grapes face a daunting array of f ungal diseases, which, left unchecked, can significantly reduce the economic va lue of the crop. Each year , the likelihood of spread and infection by all grape pathogens within a vineyard are str ongly dependent on local weather conditions. This includes powdery mildew. For this reason, Dr. Francis J. Ferrandino , together with collaborators from the University of Massachusetts, University of Connecticut, and University of Rhode Island, have been awar ded a Northeast IPM research/extension grant entitled: \"Combining a disease and weather mon itoring network with measurements of inoculum potential for disease forecasting in vineyard IPM for southern New England.\" This joint research-extension project focuses on improving control of vineyard diseases and reducing pesticide inputs. This will be accomplishe d by providing growers with disease support information on the risk of infection of disease in real time via the Internet. The system will use weather-based disease-risk models. We will esta blish weather monitoring stations in research and commercial vineyards througho ut southern New England. Thes e stations will be connected through cellular modems to a central location. Initial inoculum levels will be directly assayed at test vineyards and the survival and maturati on of the overwintering stage pathogens will be evaluated. In addition, inoculum potential will be evaluated each week using potted trap plants and mechanical spore samplers to determine the concentration of airborne inoculum. As follows are highlights of this research initiative: Dr. Ferrandino will initiate studies on the use of weather stations to monitor and validate models for powdery mildew and other common diseases of grape. Dr. Ferrandino is continuing to evaluate extraction techniques for estimating overwintering inoculum of grape powdery mildew on vine bark and shed leaves. Dr. Ferrandino will establish sampling protocols to estimate phenological development of grape vines, and, concurrently, di sease incidence and severity. Dr. Ferrandino has established three 0.25-acre research vineyards located in Windsor, Hamden, and Voluntown, CT. Weather stations will be placed at each of these locations. 154 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Dr. Ferrandino pruning newly planted grapes at the Valley Laboratory in Windsor. Preliminary results from data collected at the Valley Laboratory in Windsor, CT have indicated the importance of evaluating primary i noculum levels and stage of development for grape powdery mildew. Throughout the month of May 2008, existing disease risk models predicted favorable conditions for the spread of th is disease and, therefore, suggested the use of fungicide sprays. However, direct examina tion of overwintering spor e-bearing structures extracted from bark, canes, and buds showed that the spores were not mature until the first week of June 2008, considerably later than the model predicted. If this information had been passed on to growers, it would have eliminated the nece ssity of the two foliar sprays that had been recommended by the existing weather model. Impact: The timely dissemination of inoculum development information to growers will eliminate unnecessary foliar sprays. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 155 Symptoms of powdery mildew on a grape cluster close to harvest. Use of nonparametric statistics to describe distributions of plant disease and insect populations Dr. Ferrandino has been studying the effect of spatia lly and temporally aggregated plant disease data on the accuracy of disease assessme nt by sampling. The experimental result is a highly skewed distribution, dominated by a few \"hot spots\" with an abundance of leaves that have no disease. Dr. Ferrandino is continuing his investigation of the problems involved in estimating levels of plant disease. These include a re-examination of the pros and cons involved in the use of the Horsfall-Barratt disease rating scheme (with T. Gottwald and C. Bock of the USDA Florida), a mathematical investigation into the ramifications of sp atial aggregation on the accuracy of sampling schemes, and the applica tion of these methods to precision agriculture (with Dr. Donald E. Aylor ). Since this sampling problem is much more general than plant disease epidemiology, Dr. Ferrandino has been collaborating with Dr. John F. Anderson on analysis of bedbug populations. Dr. Ferrandino is applying his understa nding of skewed data to the analysis of bedbug population data obtained from overnight trap catches from various locations within infested buildings. Impact: Appropriate analysis of aggregated data provides additional information impossible to obtain by employing conventiona l parametric statistics. 156 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Environmentally-friendly control of powdery mildew on landscape plants Dr. Ferrandino is continuing his investigation of the efficacy of environmentally- friendly controls for powdery mildew. The alte rnatives to conventional chemical controls include sprays of cow's milk, compost tea, horti cultural oil, and potassium bicarbonate products. To test the efficacy of these \"en vironmentally-friendly\" sprays, Dr. Ferrandino has established a long-term \"landscape\" plot at Lockwood Farm that includes woody ornamentals and and verbena)\u2014 plants that are susceptible to powdery mildew and are commonly planted in the Connecticut landscape. Dr. Ferrandino is collaborating with Matthew DeBacco, a master's student from the University of Connecticut, who is studying the e fficacy of compost tea-based foliar sprays for the control of powdery mildew on cucurbits. Expe rimental plots in this study are located at Storrs, Windsor, and Hamden, CT. Impact: The use of efficacious, environmentally-fri endly foliar sprays to control powdery mildew will reduce the chemical load on the envir onment. This is especially valuable around the home. Studying plant disease epidemics Dr. Ferrandino has been studying plant disease epidemics involving the Septoria- Tomato and the Powdery Mildew-Pumpkin pathosystems for the past 20 years. Both of these disease-host complexes involve ve ry strong juvenile tolerance to disease--young leaves are less likely to become infected than mature leaves. In addition, both of thes e host plants go through very rapid mid-season growth spur ts during which leaf area increas es by a factor of 10 over a 5-6 week period (usually from mid Ju ly to late August). As a consequence of this rapid vegetative phase of growth, host plants are composed of a dynamic mixture of leaves of both varying age and susceptibility to disease. Tomato plot at Lockwood Farm used to study a developing epidemic of Septoria leaf spot. Since 1989, Dr. Ferrandino has planted 180- to 200-ft-long, north-south rows of tomatoes at Lockwood Farm in order to study this phenome non. These plantings were inoculated at the southern end with Septoria lycopersici and the resulting epidemic was monitored. Plant leaf area The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 157 was estimated weekly and the growing tips were ta gged weekly in order to correlate the age of leaves with disease evaluations. Results indi cate that leaves younger than 17 days old were immune to infection by Septoria. In addition, leaves older than 40 days had very few recent infections. This suggests a \"window\" of age- based susceptibility within a tomato canopy. Impact: The incorporation of age-dependent suscep tibility of foliage to disease will improve current epidemic models. Chestnut Breeding for Orchard and Timber Trees Dr. Sandra Anagnostakis is continuing her chestnut re search to develop timber and orchard trees resistant to diseases. This year, she has made further selections from the timber chestnut hybrids planted in Windsor. These 10- year-old trees show good disease resistance and are now producing seed. She is cooperating with a nursery in Georgia that has planted 3,000 of these seed for us. The trees from this plan ting will be returned to Connecticut in 2009 and planted in forest plots. Seed collected in 2005 from the Windsor trees was grown in the same nursery and 82 of the trees sent back to us in 2007 were planted in empty spaces in the Windsor plot. Hybrid seedlings from this batch have al so been sent to Alabama for a Forest Service project on survival of chestnuts in areas with Phytophthora root rot (360 s eedlings), were planted in the Farmington Town Forest (30 seedlings), in the Goodwin State Forest (100 seedlings), and in private land in Sharon (50 seedlings). Anagnostakis with chestnuts selected for timber quality and newly planted seedlings at the planting in Windsor, CT. Dr. Anagnostakis has also made selections of orchard trees from hand-pollinated chestnut crosses that were harvested in the fall of 2007. These included 272 nuts from orchard trees for 158 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 nutrient analysis, 190 chestnuts ( Castanea dentata ) for nutrient analysis and disease tests, 218 nuts from dwarf orchard trees to a cooperator in Georgia, and 309 nuts from a Chinese X Chinese cross ( C. mollissima ) for the Genetics of the Fag aceae project (planted in the greenhouse in February 2008 and transplanted to Lockwood Farm in late May 2008). In addition, 135 nuts from two hybrid X hybrid cro sses for the Genetics of the Fagaceae project were planted in the greenhouse in February 2008 and transplanted in Virginia in May 2008. The U.S. Office of Surface Mining has shown sign ificant interest in utilizing chestnut as a species for mine site reclamation. While progr ess with the traditional breeding efforts has been remarkable, the obstacles are many. This undertak ing will be advanced by the addition of the genomic component to the project with trees prov ided by Dr. Anagnostakis, which will result in a genetic map for chestnut (www.fagaceae.org). This genomic approach should lead to the identification of resistance genes and technology facilitating the rapid screening of chestnut progeny that possess genes imparting resistance to blight and other pe sts and pathogens. project to study Ozark chinquapins ( C. ozarkensis ) for their resistance to Oriental Chestnut Gall Wasp resulted in 143 open-pollinat ed seed and 253 seed from hand pollinations with Henry Chinese chinquapin ( C. henryi ) as the male parent. Seedlings grown in the greenhouse will be sent to North Carolina to our Forest Service cooperator or planted by cooperators in Connecticut. We received 103 chestnuts from Eastern Turkey from six native chestnut sites for disease resistance testing. These have been planted in the greenhouse and will be transplanted to Lockwood Farm in June. European chestnut trees ( C. sativa ) are very similar to American chestnuts, but not as winter hardy. We plan to compare the two species, which has never been carefully done. Impact: The overall impact of the project will be to further progress to ward restoration of American chestnut as a tree in North American forests and to s upport the utilizati on of chestnut as a specialty nut crop for the American marketplace. Butternut Trees in Connecticut Butternut trees have long provided a favored wood for carvers and builders. They also occupy a significant place in Native American cu lture as a source of food and dye materials. Butternut populations are declining throughout their native range, due to an exotic fungus Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum, which causes lethal ( J. ailantifolia ), and hybrids of the two species this year at Lockwood Fa rm. These seedlings will be inoculated in the fall with two strains of the butternut pathogen in or der to assess resistance. She is working with two native populations of butternut in the south in order to look for di sease resistance at the lower end of the native range of this species. Th is is part of a cooperative project that includes the University of Tennessee, Notre Dame Univer sity in Indiana, and the Experiment Station. Impact: The information on growth and disease resistan ce of butternut trees resulting from this project will provide fundamental knowledge that will give us a better understanding as to whether butternuts respond in the same way to di sease throughout their na tural range and enable The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 159 the development of a butternut project for the curriculum of the Cherokee Central Schools Board in North Carolina. Anagnostakis with a hybrid butternut tree (Japanese walnut X butternut) that was formerly the \"National Champion Butternut.\" Noteworthy Diseases Two rust diseases were of particular con cern this season, Chrysant hemum white rust and Repeating spruce needle rust. Chrysanthemum wh ite rust was confirmed for the first time in Connecticut in September 2007. Infected plants were initially found in a garden center during a routine inspection by an Experiment Station nurs ery inspector. Additional infections were subsequently found in nurseries and garden cen ters by Station inspecto rs. The disease was identified by Dr. Sharon Douglas and confirmed by the National mycologists at the USDA- APHIS-PPQ National Mycology Labo ratory in Beltsville, MD. (CWR) is caused by Puccinia horiana , an autoecious rust. This fungus is an obligate pathogen that infects 12 species of chrysanthemum, including garden mums , pot mums, and Nippon daisies. CWR was first described in Japan a nd China in 1895 and was confined to China and Japan until the 1960's. However, with increased in ternational movement of plant material, it is now established in Europe, Africa, Australia, Central America, S outh America, and the Far East. Sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Canada and the United States but they have all been successfully eradicated. CWR is a pest of quarantine sign ificance in the United States. Symptoms of CWR first appear as chloroti c spots on upper leaf surfaces that may be sunken and necrotic. These are fo llowed by the development of distinctive and diagnostic raised, pinkish to white pustules on lower leaf surf aces. Many pustules can develop on each leaf. Symptomatic leaves dry up and pe rsist on the stems. Diagnosis can be difficult since infected plants may not show any symptoms during hot or dry conditions, but when the weather turns cool and wet, symptoms develop. Once plants are infected, the pathogen's mycelium can spread throughout the plant and the disease becomes system ic. Severe outbreaks of CWR may result in total crop loss. CWR is usually introduced on infected plan t material although it can be spread by splashing water from overhead irrigation or rainfa ll. Spores can travel \u00bc mile under conditions of high humidity or during rain st orms. Spores can also be spr ead on leaf debris, contaminated equipment, clothes, and shoes--s pores can live for up to 8 weeks on contaminated objects. Since 160 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 this pathogen is new to Connecticut, information a bout its ability to survive winter conditions is not known. However, in areas of the U.S. wh ere CWR has become established on hardy mums planted outdoors, it has been found to overwinter--overwinteri ng of the fungus requires some green tissues that survive in protected parts of a plant during the winter. Symptoms of Chrysanthemum white rust (CWR) on chrysanthemums in the 'Gretchen' series. Note white rust pustules on lower surfaces of leaves. Close-up of CWR pustules illustrating the distinctive pinkish, waxy Station\u2014Record of 161 Photomicrograph depicting teliospores of Puccinia horiana . Plants that tested positive for in outbreak include several 'Gretchen' cultivars ('Bold,' 'Flashy,' and 'Sunny'), as nthemums not identified by cultivar were also found in combination pots of mums and ornament al grasses. CWR was confirmed in three Connecticut counties: Fairfi eld, New Haven, and Hartford. Because CWR is a regulated pest of quaran tine significance, steps were taken by state and federal regulators to remove and destroy infected plants from the confirmed sites in compliance with the CWR Eradication Protoc ol established by the USDA-APHIS-PPQ. Additional inspections at nurseri es and garden centers in Conn ecticut were also completed . Repeating spruce needle rust, caused by the fungus Chrysomyxa weirii, was widespread and severe throughout the state. This disease is also commonly known as Weir's rust and autoecious spruce needle rust. Although in past years this di sease had been predominately a Christmas tree plantation problem, this season it was diagnosed with great frequency in many settings including Christmas tree plantations, pr oduction nurseries, a nd landscape plantings. Hosts of the pathogen include white, black, and Colorado spruce, but the latter is the most susceptible. This rust was first described in Connecticut in 1996 but was probably present in the state for several years prior to its initial detection. Although at le ast ten other needle rust fungi (Chrysomyxa spp.) have been reported on spruce in th e United States, until 1996, only the needle rusts caused by C. ledi and C. ledicola had been of concern for Christmas tree growers in Connecticut. Unfortunately, the rust caused by C. weirii represents a particular challenge for growers, landscapers, and arborists since unlike th e other needle rusts, it is autoecious and does not require any additional hosts in or der to complete its life cycle. C. weirii has also been reported in Pennsylvania, Verm ont, New York, and New Hampshir e and appears to be on the increase throughout the Northeast. 162 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Diagnostic rust symptoms on first-year needles in spring, before new growth has emerged. Rust spores produced in pustules are blown by wind and splashed by rain onto newly emerging needles. Close-up of diagnostic rust pustule. Infected trees are rarely k illed, but the primary damage results in extensive needle discoloration and drop, which di sfigures landscape trees and reduces the marketability of infected trees in production nurseries and Christma s tree plantations. Symptoms first appear as yellow spots or flecks on needles in late winter and early spring. These s pots eventually develop into pustules or blisters (te lia) and burst open to reveal ma sses of yellow-orange spores (teliospores). The teliospores then produce an other type of spore (basidospores), which are readily blown by wind and splashed by rain onto needles of the same tree or onto those of adjacent trees. Infection occurs when needles first emerge and are tender and immature. The following spring, yellow spots and blisters develop on the infected needles and the disease cycle starts again. Blisters of C. weirii can appear on both first- and second-year needles and heavily The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 163 infected trees can appear distin ctively yellow-orange from a dist ance. Autoecious spruce needle rust can be distinguished from the heteroecious rusts by the timing of sy mptoms. Symptoms of the former are evident in late winter and early spring whereas the latter develop in mid to late summer. However, accurate diagnosis still requires microscopic examination since symptoms may easily be confused with those caused by other n eedle rusts. As with most diseases that are not fatal but result in needle drop, repeat ed defoliation may retard growth and reduce marketability. Disease Survey Dr. Douglas, Dr. Balogh, and Department Scientists assisted Ms. Inman, in diagnosing a wide range of plant health problems for homeow ners, commercial growers, plant care professionals, and government, state, and cooperative extension personnel during the past year. Fungal and bacterial diseas es were prevalent on many hosts. Herbaceous and Woody Ornamentals: A wide range of diseases wa s identified on perennials this season. Some hosts and diseases were chrysant hemum white rust, pachysandra with Volutella blight, rose with juniper and Kaba tina tip blight, hollyhock with hollyhock rust, and witch hazel and holly with Ph yllosticta leaf spot. Diplodia blight was identified on a wide variety of coniferous hosts including Austrian, white, Scots, and Mugho pines. Eastern white pine with Anthracnose diseases were identified on a wi de range of broadleaf trees incl uding oak, maple, and sycamore. There was an epidemic of Verticillium wilt in Ja panese and Norway maples. Winter injury and brown rot caused tip dieback in ornamental cher ry and prune species. Rust diseases affected crabapple and serviceberry. Symptoms of Diplodia blight on pi ne. Infected new shoots are st unted and killed before they elongate. Black fruiting structures of the fungus emerge at the base of symptomatic needles. These produce spores of the fungus that in fect newly emerging needles in the spring. Tree and small fruit: Apples were mostly affected by cedar-a pple rust and apple scab diseases in the spring and summer. Fire blight, a serious bacterial disease of apple and pear, which was detected in Connecticut orchar ds in 2006 and 2007, was not detected in spring 2008. Stone fruits including peaches, plums, and cherries were affect ed by leaf curl and brown rot. Additionally, a 164 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 number of prunes were diagnosed with black knot . On grapes, black rot, powdery mildew, and downy mildew were problematic on numerous backyard and commercial plantings. Symptoms of cedar-apple rust. This fungus overwinters on east ern red cedar as inconspicuous brown galls that develop into distinctive gelatinou s, orange structures in spring (left). Spores produced in these orange masses infect newly emerging apple or crabapple leaves in their vicinity. These infections result in diagnostic yellow-orange spots (right). Vegetables: Noteworthy outbreaks of Septoria leaf s pot and blossom-end rot on tomato were reported. Bacterial spot was diagnosed on pepper. Turf: Red thread continued to be one of the most prevalent lawn diseases in 2008. By summer, however, summer patch became the most frequently reported issue, reaching epidemic proportions. Additionally, slime mo lds, non-parasitic but rather c onspicuous relatives of fungi, were reported in home lawns. On turf, the presence of a slime mold gives the grass a bluish-gray to purple-brown appearance from a distance. Upon close inspection, individual grass blades are covered by the purple- brown mass of the slime mold. Weeds: Predominant weeds in turf were nutsedge , crabgrass, ground ivy, pokeweed, and clover. Bentgrass was also frequently identified as a common \"grassy\" weed in many home lawns. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 165 Identification and control of true, running ba mboo, Japanese knotweed, and garlic mustard (plants that often become invasive) continued to be significant probl ems for many Connecticut landowners. Poison ivy remained a ke y plant of great public concern. Impact: Information on the diseases that occur on plants in Connecticut landscapes, natural woodlots, and forests each year helps to monito r and assess the impact of these problems on the overall health of plants in the state. This inform ation also assists in dete cting new diseases or in identifying potentially important emerging dise ases on specific plants , which can then be monitored in the years that follow. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Members of the Department of Plant Pathol ogy and Ecology are involv ed in a wide range of service and public outreach activities. So me of these services involve presentations, publications, tours of fac ilities, and interviews, in addition to being conducted in cooperation with other state agencies. Seed Testing: In cooperation with th e Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Regulation and Inspection Every year, inspectors from the Bureau of Regulation and Inspection of the Connecticut Department of Agriculture collect official sa mples of vegetable, crop, and lawn seeds for analysis. Samples are submitted to The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station since it is the official seed testing laboratory for Connect icut. The Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology performs the germination and purity analys es that are required for compliance with the Connecticut Seed Law Regulations and the Fe deral Seed Act. In 2008, 327 vegetable and 13 lawn seeds were submitted to Dr. Douglas for testing. With assistance from Ms. Inman, technician, all seeds are germinated following strict protocol s designated by the Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA) . Seedlings are carefully examined, since they must appear \"normal\" (i.e., free from decay, have well-develo ped primary root systems, have well-developed and intact hypocotyls an d/or epicotyls, and ha ve healthy cotyledons). During 2008, two vegetable seed samples did no t meet germination claims. They were not retested because of insufficient numbers of s eeds. Of the 13 lawn seed samples tested, five met label claims for both purity and germina tion. Seven samples passed label claims for germination but did not meet cl aims for purity. One passed labe l claims for purity but did not meet claims for germination. Another component of the analysis is examination for prohibited noxious weed seeds. None of these samples c ontained weed contaminants in 2008. A Station bulletin reports the findings of each year's results. Impact: Results of seed test s conducted by Station staff are repor ted to the Seed Control Official of the CT Department of Agriculture who has th e authority to stop the sa le of products that do not meet label claims or contain noxious weeds. In the short term, this program protects state residents from purchasing inferior seed and ensure s that seeds comply with the Connecticut Seed Law Regulations and the Federal Seed Act. The long-term benefit of the seed testing program minimizes the inadvertent introduction of noxious w eed seeds that could potentially impact crops of economic importance and the state's ecosystem. 166 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Samples for Analytical Chemistry and th e Connecticut Depar tment of Consumer Protection During the year, Dr. Douglas and Ms. Inman examined 28 samples from the Connecticut Department of Consum er Protection at the request of the Department of Analytical Chemistry of the Experiment Station. Samples for 2008 National Nursery Survey for Phytophthora ramorum Connecticut participates in a survey of nurse ries to assess the presence of the Ramorum Blight (Sudden Oak Death) pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum , in our state. The objective is to survey nurseries at risk of harboring or distributing P. ramorum- infected plants. Drs. Douglas and Marra supervise the USDA-mandated assays for testing, which are conducted by Jason Corwin (technician). During the past year, Dr. Victoria Smith (Deputy State Entomologist) supervised the collection of 297 samples by CA ES nursery inspectors and USDA-APHIS-PPQ personnel. Samples were then tested for P. ramorum . No samples tested positive in the 2008 survey. Samples for Chrysanthemum White Rust In Fall 2007, there was an unexpected out break of Chrysanthemum white rust, a quarantine significant pest. This resulted in a cooperative effort between the Experiment Station and USDA-APHIS-PPQ. Dr. Douglas examined samples collected by CAES nursery inspectors and USDA-APHIS-PPQ personnel under the supervision of Dr. Smith . Over 5,900 chrysanthemum plants were inspected throughout the state. Citizen Inquiries Plant Disease Information Office Dr. Douglas, Dr. Balogh, and Department Scientists , assisted by Ms. Inman , answered 5,399 inquiries about plant health from Connecticut citizens. Although the majority of inquiries were on ornamentals, trees, and shrubs (65%), other categories, such as food crops (17%) and turfgrasses (4%), were also well represented. A high percentage of i nquiries fell into the miscellaneous category (14%), which included pl ant identification and poison ivy control and identification. Although the majority of inquiries were from Connecticut homeowners (65%), the number of the inquiries from commercial grow ers and plant care prof essionals (29%) showed a marked increase. Inquiries from cooperati ve extension, health, news, and agricultural personnel (6%) remained consistent with previous years. A further breakdown of inquiries showed that 45% of the samples came in by phone, 14% came in by mail, 3% came as email (Connecticut only), and 38% were brought in person. This year, the number of samples handled by the PDIO (52%) exceeded the number of phone calls (48%) for the first time since accurate recordkeeping was initiated. Over 710 letters an d numerous email message s with attached files of fact sheets were sent from the PDIO. Many citizens opted to download fact sheets posted on the CAES website in lieu of letters since this gave them instant access to the information of concern. Most of the miscellaneous questions were concerned with identification, human toxicity, and control of poison i vy and other poisonous plants, identi fication of various plants and weeds, mushroom identification for health offici als, and information about pesticides and their relationships to health an d environmental concerns. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 167 Additional inquiries Dr. Anagnostakis answered 509 questions and made 27 site visits . Dr. Elmer made 12 site visits and answered 11 questions. Dr. Ferrandino made 4 site visits and answered 10 questions, and Dr. Marra made 2 site visits and answered 4 questions from stakeholders. Impact: During 2008, around 6,000 Connecticut residents had plant disease problems accurately diagnosed by members of the Department of Pl ant Pathology and Ecology. In many cases, the plant health problems diagnosed did not require f ungicides for control, co ntrary to the initial perception that fungicides would be required. Staff worked closel y to educate professionals and homeowners to develop disease management programs that were compatible with the environment that incorporated cultural practices, sa nitation, and genetic resistance prior to pesticide use. Accurate diagnosis of plan t health problems, educated citizenry, and implementation of integrated disease management strategies reduce pesticides introduced into the environment and water of Connecticut. Awards Sandra Anagnostakis received an official citation as one of the finalists in the 2007 Connecticut Technology Women of Innovation Award. Wade Elmer was awarded the Quinnipiac Sigma Xi ch apter Certificate of Appreciation Award for his presentation at the Albert Notati on Memorial Series Seminar on March 4, 2008. Meetings Sponsored by the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology September 25, 2007: Sharon Douglas co-organized the meeting entitled \"Propagation Education.\" The meeting was co-sponsored by the Station, UCONN, and the Connecticut Greenhouse Growers Association in Jones Auditorium. Eight y-five growers attended the meeting. October 17, 2007: Wade Elmer served as the Station liaison to the Connecticut Greenhouse Growers Association Fall meeting \"Pesticides and Roast Beef\" held in Jones Auditorium. There were 30 growers present. He moderated the mee ting. Ron LaFrazier prepared the auditorium. January 24, 2008, February 5, 2008, February 28, 2008 : Wade Elmer co-sponsored three Bedding Plant Meetings with Ms. Leanne Pundt and Dr. Richard Mc Avoy of the University of Connecticut. Topics covered included: Emer ging issues in greenhouse disease management; Pesticide use: protecting yourself, your families and your workers; Update on Nutrition; Plant Growth Regulators and other Pr oduction Tips; and Update on Managing Insects and Mites; Focusing on Biological and Biorational Approach es. On January 24, the meeting was in Jones Auditorium, on February 5, the meeting was held at the Tolland Cooperative Extension Center in Vernon, CT, and on February 28, the meeting was held at the University of Connecticut, Torrington campus, in Torrington, CT. In total, 69 growers attended. Of those, 100% rated the program as useful to very useful, and 60% stated that they thought they would benefit economically as a result of this program. Ron LaFrazier prepared Jones Auditorium. 168 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 June 17, 2008: Wade Elmer served as the Station liaison to the Conn ecticut Greenhouse Growers Association special meeting entitle d \"Energy in the greenhouse\" held in Jones Auditorium. There were 69 growers present. Dr. Elmer moderated the meeting. Ron LaFrazier and Peter Thiel prepared the auditorium. Conference Organizing Dr. Marra continued to serve on the Steering Committee for th e Connecticut Conference on Natural Resources in 2008. This year, the Conference was held on Monday, March 10, 2008, at the University of Connecticut, Storrs. The conference was attended by 250 people, including six scientists from CAES who presented talks, pos ters, and one workshop at the Conference. DEPARTMENT OF SOIL AND WATER Mosquito Trapping and Testing Program . Mosquito surveillance for West Nile virus (WNV) and Eastern Equine Encepha litis (EEE) continues to be integral to the public health response to these mosquito-transmitted viruses in Connecticut. The objectives of the surveillance program are to provide: 1) early evidence of local virus activity; 2) information on the abundance, distribution, identity and infection rates of po tential mosquito vectors and; 3) information that is used to assess the threat of WNV and EEE to the public and guide the implementation of mosquito control measures. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Stati on is responsible for conducting all mosquito trapping and testing activities. The program is conducted by Dr. Theodore Andreadis and Dr. Philip Armstrong, assisted by John Shepard, Michael Thomas, and Shannon Finan. Mosquito trapping is conducted at 91 permanent trapping st ations that are located in 72 municipalities throughout the state. In 2007, mosquito trapping was conducted from June 4 to October 25. Traps were set and attended by Station staff every 10 days at each site on a regular rotation. Two trap types were used at all trapping stations - a CO2-baited CDC Light Trap, desi gned to trap host-seeking adult female mosquitoes (all species), and a Gravid Mosquito Trap, designed to trap previously blood- fed adult female mosquitoes (principally Culex and container breeding Ochlerotatus species). Elevated CO 2-baited CDC Light Traps, placed appr oximately 7 m in the tree canopy, were additionally used at 12 sites in southern Fairfield and New Have n Counties. Mosquitoes were transported alive to the laboratory each morni ng where they were identified to species. Mosquitoes were grouped (pooled) according to speci es, collecting site, and date and frozen at - 80oC. A maximum of 50 female mosquitoes we re included in each pool. Aliquots of each The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 169 mosquito pool were inoculated into Vero cell cultures for detection of WNV and other mosquito- borne arboviruses of public health importance. Virus isolates from mosquito pools were tested for WNV, EEE, Jamestown Canyon (JC), Cache Va lley (CV), Trivittatus (HJ), and LaCrosse (LAC), and Potosi (POTV) viru ses. Isolated viruses were identified by Real Time (TaqMan) polymerase chai n reaction (PCR) or standard RT-PCR using virus-specific primers. All of the virus isolation work wa s conducted in a certif ied Bio-Safety Level 3 laboratory at the Experiment Station. Weekly test results were reported to the CDC electronically via ArboNet and to the DPH for dissemination to othe r state agencies, local health departments, the media, and neighboring states. During 2007, a total of 157,476 mosquitoes (11,233 pool s) representing 35 species were trapped and tested. A total of 69 isolations of WNV were made from 5 mosquito species ( pipiens = 65, Ochlerotatus canadensis = 1, and Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus = 1), collected at 18 sites in 15 towns in 3, counties: Fairfield (Bridgeport, Danbury, Darien, Greenwich, Norwalk, Stamford, Stratford, Westport), Hartford (Glastonbury, Hartford, Manchester, Newington) , New Haven (Bethany, New Have n, West Haven). The first positive mosquitoes were collected on June 27, and the last on October 3. Four human cases were reported by the Connecticut Department of Public Health: residents of Cheshire, Darien, Hartford, and Woodbridge. Five isolations of EEE virus were made from 3 mosquito species ( Culiseta melanura = 3, Aedes cinerus = 1, and Coquilletidia perturbans = 1) collected in 2 towns, Ledyard and Plainfield in New London and Widham counties. In addition to WNV and EEE, 2 other mosquito-bor ne viruses were isolated: HJ = 2 and JC = 42.

Mosquitoes were collected at 91 trap sites, located in 72 m unicipalities, in Connecticut. Following identification, the insects were proces sed for virus isolations and identified using molecular methods to analyze RNA. During 2007, 157,476 mosquitoes were tested for virus. There were 69 isolations of WNV and 5 isolations of EEE virus. There were 4 human cases in the state linked to WNV infection. News releas es included information on how residents could protect themselves from mosquito bites, such as the use of repellents. The information contained in the news releases had an immediate impact because many residents did take the suggested precautions. The long-term benefits include a healthy human population and a well-informed public concerning the potential risks of mosquito bites. Mosquito Arbovirus Studies . Epidemics and epizootics of eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), observed by an electron microscope (photo), occur sporadically in temperate regions where transmission is seasonal from late summer to early fall. These outbreaks may de rive from virus that overwinters locally or perhaps, results from rein troduction of virus fr om other sites. To evaluate these possibilities, Drs. Armstrong, Andreadis, and Anderson compared the phylogenetic relationships of EEEV isolates obtained from mosquitoes co llected during statewide 172 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 arbovirus surveillance in Connecticut, in additi on to isolates from c oncurrent outbreaks in southern New Hampshire and upstate New York. In Connecticut, viral isolates grouped into temporally discrete clades by year of isolati on or over two years of sampling. Two or more clades arose in 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2006, possibly the result of separate introduction events into the state, whereas viruses from upstate New York and New Hampshire segregated into single clades that persisted for two or more years. New Hampshire viruses shared recent common ancestry to those isolated in Connec ticut suggesting viral dispersal among these regions. These results provide evidence for independent episodes of EEEV overwintering in northern foci. Moreover, our study finds regi onal differences in the population dynamics of EEEV from northeastern US. The population from upstate New York was genetically homogenous from 2003-2007, whereas viruses sampled from Connecticut were more genetically diverse and subject to high rate s of population turnover, implyi ng increased movement of new strains into this region. Impact . Current studies on the geneti c relationships of mosquito-bor ne viruses will enable us to track the origin and spread of viral strains involved in disease outbreaks and to id entify variants associated with different ecological niches an d/or disease outcomes. This information may ultimately be used to improve surveillance and intervention strategies against these viruses. Introduction of the Asian Tiger Mosquito in Connecticut The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus is presently recognized as the most invasive mosquito in the world having spread from its native range in Southeast Asia to at least 36 countries over the last three decades. This has occurred primarily thr ough the worldwide trade in used tires and more rece ntly via containerized shipments of infested ornamental \"lucky bamboo\" plants. In the United States, established populations of this species have been reported fr om 866 counties in 26 states in the eastern half of the country extending from southern Florida and Texas, to Chicago, Illinois the northernmost infestation. In the northeast, Ae. albopictus has invaded much of New Jersey, portions of southern Pennsylvania, and the New York C ity metropolitan area. However, while a few individuals have been occasionally collected in surveillance activities in the neighboring New England states, no established infestations have been identif ied in this region. In July 2006, an introduction of Ae. albopictus was documented for the first time at a commercial tire recycling plant in northeaste rn Connecticut. The introduction likely occurred via transport of infested tires originating from northern New Je rsey or metropolitan NYC. Upon this discovery, field and laboratory investigati ons were initiated by Dr. Theodor e Andreadis assisted by Michael Thomas and John Shepard to determine season al establishment and overwintering success by assessing adult biting and ovipos ition activity in th e surrounding woodlands. The first adult female was collected in a CO 2-baited Mosquito Magnet\u00ae Liberty tr ap within the confines of the tire plant during the week of July 28. Additional females were collected intermittently thereafter through October 16. Host-seeking female Ae. albopictus attempting to alight on human subjects The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 173 and larvae hatching from eggs collected in ovitra ps placed in the woodl ands surrounding the tire plant, were detected weekly from August 21 through October 2 denoting seasonal establishment in the immediate woodlands. However, no larvae of Ae. albopictus were recovered from eggs collected in ovitraps that were placed in the surrounding woodla nds or in traps placed 1 to 1.6 km away, nor were any host seeking females detected by human subjects the following season (July to October 2007), indicating that the species did not surviv e winter conditions to enable successful regeneration. The failure of Ae. albopictus to overwinter and establish itself in the forested woodlands following several weeks of seasonal breeding and oviposition during the summer and early fall were most likely due to winter egg mortality, in terspecific competition from Ochlerotatus triseriatus and Ochlerotatus japonicus and/or other ecological barriers. Impact . Permanent establishment of this invasive mosquito in New England is unlikely despite the recurring importation of infested used tires into recycling facilities. However, continued monitoring of such facilities fo r potential re-invasion is warrante d especially in urban/suburban environs where global warming and milder wi nter temperatures may provide more suitable conditions in the future for colonization. Mosquito Genetic Studies In the northeastern United States, Culex pipiens has been implicated as the primary vector of West Nile virus (WNV). The Culex pipiens complex exists in two forms that exhibit substantially different behavioral and physiological characteristic s but are morphologically indistinguishable. Culex pipiens f. pipiens generally develop in aboveground environments, mate while swarming in open areas, undergo obligatory wint er diapause, and require a blood meal to develop eggs. Culex pipiens f. molestus in contrast, inha bit subterranean environments especially in urban areas, mate in confined spaces, remain active throughout the winter, and produce their first batc h of eggs without a blood meal. Local studies on the host feeding preferences of aboveground populations presumed to be Cx. pipiens f. pipiens, have shown that this form has a very strong preference for avian hosts with occasional feeding on mammals including humans. Studies in Europe, however, ha ve demonstrated that the molestus form feeds readily on mammals and is an aggressive human biter. Definitive knowledge of the biting behavior of North American populations of Cx. pipiens f. molestus is lacking. The two forms generally are reproductively isolat ed in nature but have been re ported to occasionally hybridize in urban areas during the late summer producing hybrid females th at feed indiscriminately on avian or mammalian hosts. The extent a nd distribution of hybrid populations of Cx. pipiens in the northeastern United States is unclear and there is a need to mo re fully characterize the genetic structure of natural populations of this mosquito v ector both spatially and temporally in order to better interpret epidemiological studies. Dr. Shoaming Huang, Dr. Goudarz Molaei and Dr. Theodore Andreadis designed a study to examine the genetic structure of urban and rural populations of Cx. pipiens f. pipiens and compare them to Cx. pipiens f. molestus in the northeastern United States. They utilized a set of 174 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 twelve microsatellite DNA mark ers to analyze populations from five urban/suburban and three rural locations in Connecticut, and urban loca les from Trenton, New Jersey, New York City, New York and Cambridge, Massachusetts. The mean numbers of allele s per locus for the aboveground Cx. pipiens f. 11.5 \u00b1 2.34 to 13.17 \u00b1 2.42 and were not significantly different. In contrast, below ground populations of Cx. pipiens f. molestus collected from New York City had greatly reduced allelic diversities with an average of 4.42 \u00b1 1.22 a lleles per locus, which was significantly lower than that of any of the Cx. pipiens f. pipiens populations analyzed. We did not detect significant genetic differences between urban and rural populations of Cx. pipiens f. pipiens from Connecticut nor did we observe te mporal genetic changes. However, in a comparative analysis with populations of neighboring states, New Je rsey, New York and Massachusetts, genetic variations associated with geographic distance were identified. In the analyses of Bayesian clustering and PCA, we identi fied f. that Cx. pipiens f. molestus was genetically distinct from any of the Cx. pipiens f. pipiens populations ex amined during this study. Impact. These population genetic studies provide vital information for evaluating the respective role members of the Cx. pipiens species complex play in enzoo tic and epidemic transmission of WNV and other arboviruses in various regions in the US. New Parasite of Mosquitoes Discovered Microsporidia are among the larg est and most diverse group of parasitic microorganisms which in fect mosquito populations in nature. At present, approxi mately 150 different species representing 23 genera have been described and attempts have been made to utilize these paras ites as biological control agents. While conducting a survey of temp orary vernal pool habitats in the Tomsk region of Siberia in Russia, several larvae of the mosquito, Ochlerotatus caspius were discovered with patent infections of a novel microsporid ium by a Russian scientist, Dr. Anastasia Simakova. Samples were sent to Dr. Theodore Andreadis and Dr. Charles Vossbri nck for molecular analysis and based on ultrastructural morphology, developmental characteristics, and comparative sequence anal yses of the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA genus and speci es of Microsporidia, Andreanna caspii was described. Parasite development occurs in fat body tissue and infected larvae appear swolle n with dull white masses within the thorax and abdomen. Meronts have diplokaryotic nuclei a nd are delineated by a simple plasmalemma contiguous with the host ce ll cytoplasm. Merogony occurs by synchronous binary division followed by cytokinesis. Diplokaryotic sporonts undergo meiosis and synchronous nuclear division forming sporogonial plasmodia with two, four and eight nuclei enclosed within a persistent s porophorous vesicle. Cytokinesis of sporogonial plasmodia results in the formation of eight uninucleate spores. The episporontal space of early sporonts is filled with a homogeneous accumulation of electron dens e granular inclusions and ovoid vesicles of various dimensions, transforming into an in terwoven matrix during the initial phase of The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 175 sporogenesis. Spores are oval, uninucleate a nd measure 4.8 \u00b5m \u00d7 3.1 \u00b5m. The spore wall is 260 \u00b5m thick with an irregular e xospore consisting of two layers and a thinner endospore. The anchoring disc is well develope d and is contiguous with a lamella r polaroplast that occupies the anterior third of the spore and possess more narrow lamellae on the posterior end. The polar filament is gradually tapered and arranged in a single row consisting of six coils ranging. The posterior vacuole is moderately sized and filled with a matrix of moderate electron density. Phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA from A. caspii and 30 other species of microsporidia including 11 genera parasiti c in mosquitoes using maximum parsimony, neighbor joining and maximum likelihood methods showed A. caspii to be a sister group to the clade containing all of the Amblyospora species, including Culicospora, Edhazardia and Intrapredatorus , as well as Culicosporella and Hyalinocysta thus providing strong support for establishment of Andreanna as a separate genus. Invasive Aquatic Weeds in Connecticut lakes Surveillance and Monitoring Program: A fifth full season of mon itoring and surveillance for invasive aquatic weeds in CT lakes was completed in 2007 by Gregory Bugbee, Roslyn Selsky and Dr. Jason White. A total of 133 lakes have been mapped for aquatic vegetation; 7 in this last year. These 133 lakes now have GPS-based bathymetric vegetation maps created and digitized. In addition, GPS-derived transects have been established within each lake or pond. These transects will serve as a diagnostic assessment tool to track changes in aquatic species abundance and distribution over time. Monitoring results show that more the 60% of the water bodies have been invaded by a non-native aquatic plant and many have multiple i nvasive species present. The most commonly found invasive plants were curly leaf pondweed quadroflia). Samples of all species from all surveyed lakes are being archived in the herbarium collection at The Connecticut Agricult ural Experiment Station. A new initiative began this year to investigate the use aerial imag es as a surveillance tool . Aerial photographs were obtained for three of the State's largest lakes (Candlewood, Lillinonah and Zoar) from the United States Department of Agriculture (U SDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). Although actual shoreline conditions are easily visible, accurate analysis and monitoring of submersed aquatic vegetation wi ll require the use of specialized computer software; these applications are currently bei ng evaluated. All information is currently being 176 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 incorporated into the Invasive Aquatic Plant Prog ram website as part of the Experiment Station's web page. Impact. The monitoring and surveillance program has scientifically confirmed anecdotal and historical data; clearly invasive aquatic plant species are bot h present and problematic in a large number of CT water bodies. Surveillance of Invasive Plants in Lakes Used for Hydroelectric Generation: Connecticut has several hydroe lectric plants that rely on the release of lake water to power generators. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has required FirstLightPower Resources, who owns the hydroelectric plants on Lake Candlewood, Lillinonah and Zoar, to provide surveys of the lakes for invasive plants on an annual basis. A grant was provided the CAES Invasive Aquatic Plant Program (IAPP) to perform the surveys during the summer of 2007. The number of plant species found in Lakes Candlewood, Lillinonah and Zoar are quite similar. Candlewood Lake has 16 species, Lake Lillinonah has 15 species and Lake Zoar has 18 species. These species ri chness values are average for CT lakes and ponds which range from a low of 2 to a high of 28. The invasive plants M. spicatum and N. minor are the most frequently occurring sp ecies in all three lakes. P. crispus also occurs in all three lakes but was probably not completely accounted fo r as it senesced during the survey. A small population of the invasive M. quadrifolia was located in Lake Zoar. Invasive species accounted for more than two-thirds of the plant occurr ences in each lake. Annual surveys of Candlewood, Lillinonah and Zoar require need a considerable commitment. Two teams of experienced CAES IAPP surveyors headed by Mr. Bugbee and Ms. Selsky required 25 days or 700 worker hours to complete the task. Surveys using remote sensin g with aerial imagery could reduce this time if the imagery could be satifactoral ly correlated with in -lake surveys. CAES IAPP has sponsored a flyover of the lakes in 2008 to obt ain four band images with one meter resolution. These images will be correlated to the 2008 in-lake surveys. If remote sens ing is determined to adequately delineate areas of invasive plants, CAES IAPP an d others will have a powerful tool for rapid large-scale assessment of invasive aquatic plants Impact. Lakes Candlewood, Lillinonah and Zoar are h eavily infested with invasive aquatic plants. Monitoring and control is necessary to protect the hydro-generating capabilities of these lakes. Control with herbicides. A central goal of the program has b een to investigate novel methods of chemical control to restore native plant communiti es to aquatic ecosystems as they existed prior to invasion by non-native species. Current research projects that are summarized below: The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 177 Bashan Lake, East Haddam, CT. Water milfoil is an invasive aquatic plant that can restrict the recreational us e of lakes and eliminate desirable native aquatic pl ants. Since 1994, the Station has been monitoring the milfoil problem in Bashan Lake, East Haddam. The C onnecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CTD EP), the town of East Haddam and the Bashan Lake Association have supplied the Station grants to study the use of the herbicide 2, 4-D for controll ing the milfoil. Greg Bugbee and Dr. Jason White have met with lake association, CTDEP and town officials to edu cate the public on the project and obtain the necessary permits. From 2000 - 2007 areas of Bash an Lake were treated with 2, 4-D (2, 4-D ester). Although control was generally very good regrowth occurred in some areas and new areas of milfoil were found particularly in wate r from 10 - 20 feet deep. Recent tests discovered that late summer applications of 2, 4-D is as effective as the tr aditional spring treatments and the rate can be reduced from 200 lbs/acre to 75 - 100 lbs/acre. Areas treated with 2, 4-D usually stay nearly milfoil free for at least two years. Reinfe station is thought to o ccur either by uncontrolled remnants of previous plants or rooting of plant fragments from untreated portions of the lake. Underwater video equipment linked to a global positioning system (GPS) has allowed CAES to accurately document large areas of milfoil that were previously unknown. This milfoil could be the source of plant fragments. In September 2007 2, 4-D was applied to 20 acres of milfoil that occurred sporadically throughout the lake. Although the need for yearly follow-up applications of herbicide has not been eliminated Bashan Lake is now largely free of nuisance variable milfoil and lake users and government o fficials have noted the drastic improvement since CAES began the control program. Nearby groundwater well s are tested and no 2, 4-D has been found. Impact. : Development of effective herbicide treatments for variable milfoil can limit it's spread. Fall applications of 2,4-D have been found to be highly desirable because exposure by stakeholders is limited, the milfoil is highly suscep tible and toxicity to native species is low. Nearby wells are not affected. Biological control of Eurasian milfoil, sago pondweed, curly leaf pondweed and coontail with triploid grass carp in Grannis Lake, East Haven CT. The effectiveness of the aquatic flur were tested in Grannis Lake from 2005 -2006. The lake was surveyed for aquatic vegetation prio r to treatment and again each spring thereafter. North/South transects were made at 100 feet intervals using GPS. Vegetation samples were obtained every 50 ft., identified, judged for abundance and then brought back to the lab to obtain dry weight. Cont rol was limited to the year of application. To provide longer term control. In 2006, CAES began investigating the possibili ty of introducing plant eating fish called grass carp ( Ctenopharyngoden idella ) into Grannis Lake. CAES Lake Owners Association procure a CT DEP permit to a llow the introduction. With CAES assistance, a screen was designed and placed in the 178 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 lakes outlet stream to preven t the fish from escaping. In September 2007, 300 twelve inch triploid grass carp were introduced into th e lake. Three 1m X 3m screen exclosures were placed in random locations to determine the defense in plant growth where the fi sh are not allowed to feed. Normally, many years are needed for th e grass carp to grow large enough to consume enough vegetation to provide noticeable control. The yearly surveys will continue to further track the effects of the fish. Water samples are periodically tested for temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, and phosphorus. Impact . This experiment will provide much needed information on the effectiveness of grass carp on controlling nuisance aquati c plants and the potential nega tive effects on desirable native vegetation. Crystal Lake- Middletown, CT. Mr. Bugbee and Dr. White tested th e effectiveness of an early sp ring application of the aquatic herbicide diquat to control curly leaf pondweed in Crystal Lake. This weed has a unique life cycle that causes it to grow rapidly in early spring, produce a reproduc tive structure called a turion in late spring a nd then die back by mid summer. The theory behind this experiment was that controlling the pond weed prior to turion production would eliminated the weed the first year and by limiting it's reproductive capacity reduced it the following year. CAES assisted the Town of Middletown in procuring a CTDEP permit to apply the herbicide with the provi so that a state listed species ( Potamogeton vaseyi ) present in two locations was protected with curtain like limno- barriers. CAES located the sites with GPS and, in late April 2007, directed the placement of the limnobarrier by a private contractor. After de termining existing vegetation on georeferenced transects, CAES applied the diquat on April 30. At this time curly leaf pondweed had not yet grown near the surface and had not yet produced turions. A survey performed one week later found near 100 percent control of the pondweed a nd associated Eurasian water milfoil. A follow-up survey in September found the beginni ngs of regrowth of the curly leaf pondweed but no Eurasian water milfoil. A survey, by CT DEP officials, found P. vaseyi both inside and outside the limno-barrier areas. This indicates the early season application of Diquat did not harm the state listed plant and in the future the barriers may be unnecessary. The spring 2008 survey found regrowth of curly leaf pondweed si milar to the before treatment level but no regrowth of Eurasian water milfo il. Turions in the sediment fr om previous years are likely the cause and multiple year treatments may be necessary to deplete them. Impact. These experiments provide information on the effectiveness of chemically controlling invasive species while simultaneous ly protecting threatened plants. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 179 Integrated pest management. The first part of a two-year study on the potential development of an insect-based integrated pest management approach for i nvasive aquatic plants was completed by Dr. Michele Ma rko and Dr. Jason White. The overall goal of this resear ch is to reduce the use of aquatic herbicides by validating the efficacy of an integrated biological (insect) and chemical control technique to manage the plant Eurasian watermilfoil first based-tank studies were used to quantify M. spicatum control with the follo wing techniques applied separately : the herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or fluridone at the recommended application the insect herbivore Euhrychiopsis lecontei (the milfoil weevil). These data are a prerequisite to the 2008 field experiments that involve reducing the overall pesticide application rate while simultane ously integrating the milfoil weevil. Sixteen 387-liter tanks were established in a randomized block design. Each tank was amended with thirty plastic pots containing approximately 400 g of a sediment/loam media. Water was then slowly added to the tanks and twenty centimeter stems of Eurasian milfoil ( M. spicatum ) were added to the pots; four individual plants per pot. The four treatme nts included control, Navigate TM (2,4-D), milfoil weevil ( E. lecontei The two aquatic herbicides were added at the manufacturer's r ecommended application rates; the weevils were acquired from existing cultures in our greenhouse a nd were added to achieve a final density of 1- 2 weevils per stem. In the contro l tanks, the average wet root a nd shoot mass per plant increased by three-fold during the experi ment, indicating successful esta blishment and robust vegetation growth. All three treatments dr amatically reduced milfoil bioma ss. In the Navigate treatment, the plant biomass declined rapidly over the first 2-3 weeks, with nearly 100% control by week 4. Milfoil control by fluridone and the weevils was approximately 80% after 2.5 months. We are currently determining the efficacy of milfo il control by reduced pesticide levels with simultaneous integrated weevil inoculations. Impact. Successful development of a biological control technology or an integrated chemical/biological strategy will increase the to ol box of options for lake managers and may result in dramatically reduced levels of chem icals being introduced as part of management efforts. Biological control: Field introduction of the milfoil weevil , Euhrychiopsis lecontei . Dr. Michelle Marko separate field stocking experiments of the milfoil weevil in both Indian and Candlewood lakes. The weevils were introduced by a commercial vendor while CAES sc ientists conducted milfoil and weevil surveys before and af ter introduction of the insect. Multi-year monitoring efforts ar e planned at both lakes. 180 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Drs. Vossbrinck and Marko have additionally be gun a project to design microsatellite markers for E. lecontei , which feeds on Eurasian and northern wate rmilfoil. They hope to be able to distinguish among populations of E. lecontei by comparing the DNA microsatellite marker data with that of geographic location and host preference Molecular biology studies of aquatic plants . Efforts to create a molecular database of aquatic plant species found in CT waters have continue d by Dr. Charles Vossbrinck, assisted by Kirsten Deeds. He has developed procedures for the isolation of DNA from ph ylogenetically diverse groups of aquatic plants. Using the isolated DNA, three genes (small ribosomal subunit, internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA, intergenic sp acer) from each plant have been amplified and sequenced. DNA from one gene has been isolated from 56 pl ant species while DNA from 3 genes has been isolated for 41 species. We are in the process of creati ng an on-line database on the CAES website and have submitted 130 sequences to GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html ). Dr. Vossbrinck has discovered that for certain species, interference by other plant constituents makes DNA extraction difficult. Consequently, he has developed novel methods using cesium chloride/ethidium bromide density gradients and ultracentrifugation to effectively isolate and purify DNA bands. He is also experimenting with alternative iodina ted compounds (Iodixionol and Optiprep). Separately, we are currently developing several molecular pr ojects to assess the degree of hybridization among different invasi ve species. The process of hybridization is of interest phylogenetically but may also have significant impli cations for control and management efforts. In one such collaborative project with Dr. Ryan Thum of Grand Valley State University (Michigan), we have recently observed that four separate li neages of variable milfoil (Myriophyllum heterophyllum ) exist in CT waters, as compared to New Hampshire where only a single lineage is present. We have collected M. heterophylum samples from up to five separate locations within eighteen CT Lakes. These samples have been sent to Dr. Thum so as to further characterize the distribution of th e four different lineages within the state. We have also collected water quality data (alkalinity, nutrients, pH, a nd conductivity) at each sampling location and will determine the relationship betw een these lake water characteristics and the distribution of the vari ous milfoil lineages. Impact. The successful implementation of a molecular-based identification system will significantly increase the accuracy of vegetation surveys in CT Lakes. Also, knowledge on the extent of hybridization among aquatic plant species and of population-level differences among biological control agents is of signifi cant scientific and practical interest. Outreach. Given the magnitude of invasion by non- native aquatic plants, we are making significant efforts to engage citizen s, lake associations, and other stakeholders as part of this project. CAES scientists have organized ma ny workshops on the identif ication of invasive aquatic plants and spoke to numerous lake asso ciations on management techniques. We have assembled numerous publications th at are freely available in hard copy or electronically. Lastly, a web site has been constructed that details a ll specifics of the CAES Invasive Aquatic Plant Program, including a full description of the resear ch goals and a complete presentation of the project results ( http://www.ct.gov/caes/ ). Included are all publica tions in downloadable PDF formats, as well as the digitized interactive maps of all surveyed lakes. CAES scientists have The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 181 also given presentations to pr ofessional organizations such as the Northeast Aquatic Plant Management Society (NEAPMS), the Connectic ut Conference on Natural Resources (CCNR), the Northeast Association of Environmental Biologists (NEAEB), and the Northeast Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force (NEANS), Connectic ut Federation of Lakes (CFL), and Northeast Arc Users Group (NEARC). Impact. Successfully educating and engaging stake hol ders is critical to the success of CAES efforts at managing invasive a quatic plants in CT waters. Phytoremediation of Persistent Organic Pollutants. Studies were conducted in an ongoing investigation of the potential of certain vegetation to remove mode rately low levels of persistent organic pollutants from soil and other media. Previous data had indicated that Cucurbita pepo ssp pepo (zucchini) cultivars seemed to have remarkable abilities to phytoextract the weathere d residues but that significant crop variability may exist down to the subspecies level. Studies were conducted under this line of investigation in the past year. In field experiments at Lockwood farm, six different cultivars of C. pepo were grown in soil containing weathered DDE at leve ls of Raven, Costata Romanesco) were from the subspecies pepo and have been previously shown to accumulate significant amounts of weathered DDE in the roots and stems. The other three cultivars (Zephyr, Yellow Crook, Star ship) were from the subspecies ovifera and have been previously shown to accumulat e negligible amounts of weathe red DDE. The goal of the 2007 field season was two-fold; to again demonstrate the DDE uptake abilities of these cultivars and also to create all possible crosses be tween the different DDE accumulating and non- accumulating cucurbit cultivars. Manual pollination of female flowers began in the middle of the growing season. By destructiv e harvest in mid-August, hybrid fruit had been obtained from all 18 possible crosses. Over the fall and wint er, viable seeds were harvested from the hybrid fruit and were prepared for plan ting. Preliminary data indicate that the six cucurbit cultivars accumulated similar contaminant levels to that observed in previous years. The current 2008 field season will investigate the DDE accumu lating ability of these F1 hybrids. Impact. The ability to accumulate and translocate w eathered DDE is a unique ability restricted to C. pepo ssp pepo . Following the DDE accumulating abilities of F1-F3 hybrids of accumulating and non-accumulating C. pepo will make it possible to determine the underlying molecular basis for this unique ability. 182 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 In collaborative experiments with Dr. Om Parkash of the University of Massachusetts, DDE-accumulating and non-accumulating cucurbit cultivars were grown in hydroponic solutions that contained the contaminant at levels just under water solubility. After 4 weeks, the tissues (roots, shoots) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped to UMass for a differential mRNA substraction an alysis. A colony array method for screening the differentially expressed subtracted cDNAs from C. pepo ssp pepo stem and root tissues in DDE-exposed C. pepo ssp ovifera . pepo ssp pepo as C. pepo ssp ovifera set as \"driver.\" As shown the figure below, the subtracted cDNAs that were differentially expressed were hybridized strongly to the forwar d subtracted probes (A). Initially, we picked 24 cDNA clones, which were present in \"tester\" population from C. pepo ssp pepo stems and \"driver\" cDNAs set C. pepo ssp ovifera stem tissues. We have sequenced these differently expressed cDNA clones. A BLAST sear ch against plant gene database showed the sequence homology with 'Phloem Protein 1 (PP1)' from Cucurbita maxima and many 'novel' genes with unknown function. The PP1 protein is suspected to be involved in long distance transport of solutes, other metabolites. We are in the process of confirming the differential regulation of the putative PP1 and other 'novel' genes C. ovifera stem and root tissues exposed to DDE. Impact. The ability to accumulate and translocate weathered DDE is a unique ability restricted to pepo . Isolation of the molecular/genetic cont rols of this system will enable a full characterization of the remedial pot ential of this species, as well as potential transfer of the genes to plants perhaps more effective and am enable to field scale phytoremediation. In collaborative experiments with Dr. Jas on Kelsey of Muhlenberg College, small pot experiments were conducted on some of the F1 hybrids isolated during the 2007 field season at Lockwood farm (2A above). As can be seen in Fi gure 3, the shoot DDE content of the two parent cucurbits differed significantly. Interestingl y, both F1 hybrids (the accumulating zucchini crossed with the non-accumulating squash and vi ce versa) had little abi lity to accumulate the contaminant. Additional studi es are being done currently. Impact. The ability to accumulate and translocate weathered DDE is a unique ability restricted to C. pepo ssp pepo . Following the DDE accumulating abilities of F1-F3 hybrids of accumulating and non-accumulating C. pepo will make it possible to determine the underlying molecular basis for this unique ability. Shoot DDE content Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 183 Mechanism of Sorption Hysteresis of Organic Compounds to Soil Natural Organic Matter (NOM). Hysteresis, a frequently observed phenomenon in sorption studies of organic compounds, is inconsistent with the key assumption of so rption reversibility in most transport and bioavailability models for these compounds, a nd therefore compels a study of its underlying causes. Radiolabeled 1,4-dichlorobenzene (14C-DCB) isotope tracer exch ange was carried select points along the isotherms of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (DCB) in a brown coal and a peat soil, holding total DCB concentration constant. Tracer exchange was performed by Dr. Joseph Pignatello in both the forward (sorption) and reve rse (desorption) directio ns at the bulk sorption points and in the desorption di rection at the corresponding bulk desorption point. Bulk DCB isotherms showed concentration-dependent hystere sis. However, tracer re-equilibration in all cases was consistent with free exchange between sorbed and aqueous-phase molecules. These results rule out common experi mental artifacts and demonstrate that sorption of bulk DCB is truly hysteretic (irreversible). The differences in rates between bulk and tracer sorption and desorption are consistent with the coupling of bul k DCB diffusion to other processes that retard equilibration, which we assign to matrix swelling /shrinking. Hysteresis is attributed to matrix deformation\u2014specifically, to inelastic expansi on and creation of voids accommodating sorbate molecules in the matrix leading to enhanced a ffinity in the desorpti on step. Comparing the results to previous results for na phthalene (NAPH) in the coal, we find that irreversible effects are similar for DCB and NAPH in the coal, but differ for DCB between the two sorbents. An explanation based on the differe nt physical properties of these sorbents is provided. Solid-phase extraction of equilibrated DCB with Tenax\u00ae revealed a highly desorption-resistant fraction. While too small to account for the observed hystere sis, this fraction may represent molecules that become trapped as the matrix collapses and si multaneously stiffens during abrupt desorption. The results confirm and broaden previous findings that hysteresi s in NOM can be due to true causes that can only be explained by the creation of metastable stat es with lifetimes longer than diffusion and that arise in response to sorbate loading. The results also support our previous conclusion that this metastability arises from i rreversible matrix swelli ng due to the stiff-chain (glassy) nature of NOM. We have found that th ese irreversible effects are similar for two nonpolar aromatic molecules of similar size; that they depend on concentr ation; and that this concentration dependence is different in the two sorbents studied. More definitive conclusions about the influence of molecular and sorbent stru cture must await furthe r studies. Lastly, the results show generation of a small, highly deso rption-resistant fraction that appears when the concentration gradient is abruptly steepened, but it is premature to conclude that it is permanently \"trapped.\" Impact. Although it is not yet possible to generalize to a ll soils, the findings of this study suggest sorption will often be irreversible in the sense that it follows different microscopic pathways in the forward and reverse directions . This has important implications for solute transport and bioavailability of pollutants in the environment. It further suggests that relaxation kinetics may have to be considered in solute transport models. 184 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Photochemical Bleaching of Marine Dissolved Organic Matter. (Dr. Pignatello in collaboration with William Mitch of Yale Univer sity). The fate of dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) in seawater has important implic ations for the planetary carbon cycle and oceanic biological productivity. Li ttle is known quantitativ ely about how marine DOM is transformed and degraded. Proposed pro cesses include enzymatic (microbial), direct photochemical bleaching, and secondary reactions of DOM with photolytically-generated inorganic free radicals such as hydroxyl, carbon ate, and halogen radi cals (halogen atoms or dihalogen anion radicals). Prelim UV-visible irradiated samples show that halide ions accelerate photobleach ing of marine DOM and may aff ect the pathway. Rate studies show photobleaching in synthetic seawater to be a two-stage (fast-slow) process and to be faster than up to two times faster than photobleaching in synthetic seawater when perchlorate ion (assumed inert) is substituted fo r halide. Irradiation carried out in the presence of free radical trapping agents seem to rule out a major role for free radicals, although a minor role is still possible. Fluorescence excitation-emission mappi ng indicates that halid e ions influence the intermediate products of DOM photobleaching. Impact. While more study is obviously needed, thes e results show that direct photobleaching may be a major pathway for abiotic processing of DOM in seawater and sea spray, and that chloride ion effects both the ra te and pathway of photobleaching. Effect of Cu(II) on the Sorption of 2,4,6- Trichlorophenol Xiao-quan Shan, Resear ch Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing). Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are being developed for use in many technological applicati ons and consumer products, and the ultimate release of some fraction of the produced CNTs into the envi ronment is assumed. Some studies indicate penetration of CNTs into biomembranes and ex ertion of toxic effects on organisms ranging from bacteria to animals. Carbon nanotubes ar e strong adsorbents of hydrophobic pollutants especially aromatic compounds. In this role, th ey may influence the behavior of pollutants in soils and sediments and/or may serve to carry adsorbed environment pollutants into cells. Although several studies have examined adsorpti on of individual compounds to CNTs, little is known about how organic compounds adsorb to CNTs in the presence of natural substances such as humic substances and metal ions. We st 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) on multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) at pH 4 in the presence and absence of Cu 2+ as an example of a divalent transition metal cation in the envir onment. Sorption of TCP alone was nonlinear, reversible and correlated with surface ar ea. The isotherms of TCP were best fit by a dual-Langmuir model indicating weaker and stronge r domains. Nitric acid oxidation treatment increased surface area and introduced hydrophi lic carboxylic and hydroxylic groups on the defect sites of MWCN Ts. Increasing surface area incr eased the sorption of TCP and Cu2+ individually. Carboxylic and hydroxylic groups facilitated surface complexation of Cu2+, which was verified by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, wh ile they diminished the sorption of TCP. Copper suppressed the sorption of TCP, primarily in the weaker domain, while TCP had little influence on Cu2+ sorption. It is postulated that the stronger domain of TCP is the graphene surface and the weaker domain is the pore spac es between non-exfoliated tube bundles where The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 185 condensation of TCP takes place. As condensa tion progresses, TCP-CNT interactions compete with CNT-CNT interactions, causing the bundles to swell slightly a nd facilitating further condensation. Copper competes by cross-linking -OH and -CO 2H functional groups on defect sites of adjacent tubes, creating a more tightly -knit bundle and suppressing condensation of TCP. Impact. This is a novel mechanism that will help re searchers interpret an d predict sorption and desorption of aromatic pollutants in the environment and in biological fluids. Soil Testing Testing soil samples for fertility and sugges ting methods for growi ng better plants are a continuing service for citizens of Connecticut. At the laboratory in New Haven, Mr. Bugbee tested 5291 samples and answered 2012 inquiries. Impact. The soil testing services and recommendati ons made by The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station reduce unnecessary fertilizer treatments to lawns and nursery stock throughout the state. This provi des direct economic and environm ental benefit to the suburban community by reducing nitrogen runoff into soil and water. VALLEY LABORATORY The Valley Laboratory is a multidisciplinary de partment where scientists conduct research on insects, diseases, soil nutri tion, mycology, integrated pest ma nagement and weeds of concern to commercial agriculture and homeowners in Connecticut. The Valley Laboratory was originally established by the Boar d of Control in Windsor in 1921 to conduct tobacco research. While research on shade and broadleaf tobacco continues today, the mission of the department has greatly expanded to reflect the diverse agriculture present in the state. In addition to research, Valley Laboratory scientists and staff diagnose insect and plant h ealth problems, test soils for fertility and structural analyses, conduct out reach to growers and homeowners by speaking to professional and community groups, host inform ational meetings, and assist students. 186 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Dr. John Ahrens was honored at a celebration of his 50th anniversary at the Valley Laboratory RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Activities on the farm: There were a total of 50 experimental plots during the past year at the Windsor farm. Six Windsor-based scientists had 30 of these plots; nine New Haven-based scientists and a University of Connecticut gradua te student were using the remaining 20 plots. Valley Laboratory scientists also conducted e xperiments in many plots off site, such as in growers' fields and state forest s. Farm Manager James Preste kept the farm and his equipment ready and in excellent shape. With the help of John Duclos and Jason Flynn, Jim expertly maintained the many field plots a nd addressed the specific needs of each scientist. He and his summer assistants did an outstanding job main taining the extensive ornamental garden in cooperation with the Connecticut Nursery and Landscape Association. Mr. Preste and Dr. LaMondia coordinated the Valley Laboratory effo rt to comply with EPA Worker Protection Standards for Agricultural Pestic ides and organized and conducted training sessions for the staff. Project: Biological Control of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis, is an important native conifer climax species which provides essential wildlife habita t and cover. Hemlocks also pr otect watersheds and maintain critical cool stream temperatures for native trout species. In the garden landscape, it is a popular tree and a common component in Connecticut's state parks and forests. Since 1985, eastern The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 187 hemlocks in Connecticut have been under at tack by the non-native hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae, an accidental introduction from sout hern Japan. Biological control using imported predators of the adelgid is a major l ong-term strategy for reducing the impact and spread of HWA in our eastern forests. Field Research: In Connecticut, research, release and eval uations of an imported tiny ladybeetle, Sasajiscymnus tsugae , from southern Japan to prey on HW A have been ongoing for 14 years. Over 176,000 S. tsugae have been released in 26 Connectic ut forests and parks since 1995. Dr. Cheah maintains an experimental S. tsugae colony with lines originating from the first shipments from Osaka, Japan in 1994 and 1995 and a new li ne from a different location, Kobe, Japan, obtained in 2006. Dr. Cheah has also been collecting annual data on hemlock health and adelgid population trends from 16 established release site s and other research plots throughout the state. In April-early May 2008, Dr. Cheah collected adel gid-infested foliage from 16 plots throughout the state and determined the average winter mort ality of HWA per hemlock site. The data is used to generate information on the overall cond ition of the state's hemlocks and predict levels of HWA in different regions of th e state. Dr. Cheah is also inves tigating the effect of Connecticut winters on laboratory-reared S. tsugae in winter survival studies in field cages. S. tsugae colonies in the USA were established from collecti ons from Osaka, Japan where average monthly temperatures from December through February ra nge from 4.7 - 7 \u00baC, approximately equivalent to USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 8. Hence, overw intering ability in northeastern USA is of concern. Results: Annual assessments of winter mortality of adelgid in Connecticut since 2000 have been significantly correlated to mini mum winter temperatures. HW A winter mortality reaches 90% or more when minimum daily winter temp eratures fall below - 20.5 to -23.3 \u00baC (-5 to -10 \u00baF). Winters with extreme minimum temperatures of -18 \u00baC (0 \u00baF) appear to severely reduce winter survival of la boratory-reared adult S. tsugae. Survival of overwintered adults in field cages was <5% in such regions. In 2008, th ese results indicate that severe winters or winters with extreme fluctuations of daily temperatures can result in high winter mortality of introduced predators. Milder winters lead to resurgence of HW A in subsequent springs and summers. The winter of 2008 was the mild overall and morta lity of HWA in the co ldest northern stands only averaged 40% while that in the Connecticut River Valle y, central and southern sites experienced negligible mortality of 13-14%. However, the majority of hemlocks in established S. tsugae release sites (87%) continue to maintain healthy growing crowns and ne gligible tree mortality, in spite of being infested with HWA for over 7-13 years. These release sites are in all types of hemlock habitats state wide in all three climatic re gions, and range from ma rginal growing sites on rocky ridge tops to more moisture retaining soils. 188 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 In 2007, average foliage transparency (a measur e of the fullness and vigor of the tree's crown) in 14 established re lease sites was 22, which compared favorably to uninfested baseline sites with an averag e foliage transparen cy of 23, indicating considerable crown recovery in previously heavily infested sites. Only two si tes with very droughty soils and heavy initial infestations have shown significant decline in 2007. In 14/16 older release sites, the annual crown health has impr oved significantly since the release of S. tsugae . Mean 2007 crown levels of HW A was estimated at 30% in the 14 sites which showed hemlock recovery. In 2007, HWA resurgence wa s recorded in 30% of sites, especially east of the Connecticut River. Although assessments are incomplete at this time, indications are that there is heavy resurgence of HWA in those sites in 2008. Impact: Releases of S. tsugae into previously heavily infested stands in Connecticut, in conjunction with weather events such as the impact of recent severe winters and wet, cool growing seasons, have continued to preserve and save Connectic ut's natural hemlock stands, which were previously in decline. This cont inued recovery of previ ously declining hemlock stands in Connecticut is the first to be documented in eastern states that have been infested with HWA since the early 1990s and continue d in 2007. Based on this research, S. tsugae is being commercially reared and released in multiple states. Laboratory Research: Current laboratory studies, in collaborati on with Dr. Allen Cohen of Insect Diet and Rearing Research, LLC , is aimed at the developmen t of an artificial diet and/or supplement to augment and improve the mass-rearing of adelgid predators for implementation in infested forests. Dr. Cheah and Dr. Cohen developed an innovative diet deliver y system using hemlock foliage which was important in presenting th e diet in a natural and readily acceptable environment for eliciting all stages of predator feeding. An improved artificial diet developed in 2007 by Dr. Cohen sustained high adult S. tsugae survival without access to adelgids for >5 months at 20\u00ba C. Adults remained healthy and active throughout the period while fed exclusiv ely on the egg-based diet. Females fed on diet only were reproductive a nd able to mate readily with adelgid-fed colony males after 5 months. Diet-fed adults were able to feed normally on return to HWA While there was minimal oviposition on diet only , a majority of diet-fed females readily oviposited within the first week of return to adelgid-infested hemlock. Larvae also fed readily on the improved diet and survived for several weeks but were unable to molt The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 189 Sasajiscymnus tsugae feeding on artificial diet placed on hemlock Impacts: S. tsugae is the most widely reared and released predator of HWA in Connecticut forests. Extensive releases of S. tsugae have been implemented in the most important hemlock stands in Connecticut's state forests and pa rks in efforts to protect native hemlocks Hemlock stands where the beetle has been re leased and established continue to exhibit sustained crown recovery with little or no tree mortality, dispensing with the potential costs of tree removal of hazard or dying trees and preserving the quality of recreational use for Connecticut's citizens Progress in the development of an artificia l dietary supplement which aided adult and larval survival of S. tsugae will be now extended to other HWA predator species. A dietary supplement developed by Dr. Cohen and Dr. Cheah will now be able to improve survival and storage of mass-reared adelgid predators during shortage s of prey material Diet development for biological controls of invasive weeds Mile-a-minute weed, Polygonum perfoliatum, originated from Asia and was first discovered in eastern U.S. in the 1930s and is cl assified as a noxious weed in Connecticut. It currently infests 9 eastern stat es and was first recorded in Connecticut in 1997 where it now infests portions of Fairfield and Litchfield countie s. This rapidly growing prickly and prolific vine is annual in its northern range but quickly forms dense thickets which displace native vegetation and reduces plant dive rsity. An introduced weevil, Rhinoncomimus latipes , has been successfully reared and released for control of this invasive species in th e Mid-Atlantic states. 190 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 However, weevil rearing is dependent on gr eenhouse propagation of the vine and the development of an artificial diet for mass rear ing would be beneficial in improving efficiency and space required for mass production. Dr. Cheah is collaborating with Dr. Allen Cohen in a new project on the development of an artificial diet for R. latipes in cooperation with the Phillip Allampi Beneficial Insect La boratory, New Jersey Department of Agriculture, Trenton, NJ. Results: Dr. Cheah and Dr. Cohen have developed severa l base nutritional diets and extracts (solid and liquid) from mile-a-minute weeds (stems , leaves and combinations of stems and leaves) which elicit R. latipes feeding Several of the best-performing diets have ke pt the larvae alive for 2-4 days. With no feeding, larvae will not last outside of their host plant for more than 24-30 hours. Progress has also been made with elimina ting mold development on the larval diets. Impact: Connecticut is now an activ e participant in the increa singly important arena of biological control research of invasive weeds. Chemical control of HWA Dr. Cowles has continued to improve the unde rstanding of chemical control of hemlock woolly adelgid with systemic insecticides. Starting with work initiated in 1999, he has found that imidacloprid (1) is slow-act ing, requiring 2 years to observe th e full treatment effect, (2) is much more effective as a soil a pplication, rather than through trunk injection, (3) can provide up to 7 years of suppression of adelgid populations when applied to the soil, and (4) the tree diameter influences the effectiveness of the treatment. A field dos e-response experiment conducted in Pennsylvania was very useful at determining the minimum effective dosage required for treating hemlocks of different trunk diameters. Th e relationship appears to be directly related to the water utilization by the tr ee, rather than to the biomass of the aboveground living tissue. This knowledge will allow fine -tuning of the dosage to treat trees, thereby minimizing the total amount of insecticide applie d in the environment. Analysis of samples collected from hemlock trees treated over the past 8 years has revealed that the long-term effects from a soil application are mostly due to conversi on of the imidacloprid activ e ingredient into its olefin metabolite, which is known to be about ten times as active as the parent compound. The olefin metabolite increases in concentration over two years, and then remains stable for approximately four additional years, while the imidacloprid concentrations peak in the second year after soil treatment. A field trial in the autumn of 2007 demonstrated that a new systemic insecticide, dinotefuran, is very rapidly mobilized following application to either the soil near the base of the trunk, or as a spray on the lower 4 feet of bark on the trunk itself. Adelgids nearest the tip of new growth died within approximately two weeks of insecticide application; those feeding at the base of new growth or on the previous year's growth died in about 1 or 2 months, respectively. This insecticid e and application method may provi de a valuable tool for saving trees in the southern Appalach ian Mountains. There has been rapid expansion of hemlock The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 191 woolly adelgid populations there, which threatens to kill hemlocks there quickly because their warmer winters permit most of the adelgids to survive. Combined use of dinotefuran and imidacloprid appears to be one option for saving tr ees: dinotefuran acts quickly and degrades to inactive products in the foliage, whereas imid acloprid requires more time to reach toxic concentrations, and yet will provide seve ral years of insecticidal benefit. Impact : A slow-release tablet formulation (CoreTect \u00ae) tested in Pennsyl vania forests by Dr. Cowles received a Section 18 registration for us e in the southern Appalachians where a higher per-acre dosage is currently us ed to protect dense hemlock stands. Economic impacts are difficult to estimate, but the SLN label in 5 states allows effective treatment of forest trees to maintain important environmental habitats and avoid millions of dollars in removal of hazard trees in recreational areas. In northern forests and landscapes, use of soil-applied imidacloprid has become the standard practice for arborists and homeowners for suppression of adelgid populations. Diseased and healthy (resistant) sibling strawberry lines Strawberry root pest management : Black vine weevil and black root rot are vexi ng soil-dwelling pests of perennial strawberry plantings. Dr. Cowles worked w ith Dr. LaMondia to identify cu ltivars of strawberries with resistance or tolerance to th ese two pests. Strawberry growers can now choose among several pest-tolerant cultivars when replanting their fiel ds. Dr. Cowles has also used the most pest- tolerant cultivars as parents in a breeding program for further improvement. He has developed screening methods to evaluate seedling performance against thes e pests, resulting in several advanced selections that may be suitable for further propagation and release as new cultivars. Annual bluegrass weevil is a pest specific to intensively managed golf course turf. Three years ago, golf course superintendents in the grea ter Hartford area and near New York City noted 192 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 that insecticides that they ha d been using to control annual bluegrass weevils were no longer effective. In a team effort including turf entomologists from 6 other states, Dr. Cowles has determined that these weevils have evolved resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. A simple test kit has been distributed to exte nsion entomologists, USGA represen tatives and superintendents to determine resistance status of w eevils throughout the nort heast and mid-Atlantic states. Resistant populations have now also b een identified in eastern Pennsylvania. Collaboration with Darryl Ramoutar , a Ph.D. student at University of Rhode Island, has revealed that the pyrethroid resistan ce probably evolves through P450-mediated monooxyge nases and glutathione transferases, followed by continued increases in those enzymes' activity and increases in the activity of carboxyesterases. These enzyme families work in concert to detoxify the pyrethroids, thereby reducing the probability that the insecticide molecu le can reach its target site, the voltage gated sodium channel of nerve axons. The activity of e ach class of detoxification enzymes is revealed by blocking their activity with insecticide s ynergists: piperonyl butoxide, DEM and DEF, respectively. The synergist ratio, which is the ratio of the LD50 of the population in the absence of synergist to the result in th e presence of a synergist, can be used to model resistance. The product of the three synergist ratio s is proportional to th e log of the LD50 values for each of the populations tested in Connecticut, repres enting a 200-fold range in LD50 values. Impact : A deeper understanding of the pharmacology and toxicology of these pesticides and synergists that may be used in the field pr ovides the basis for dela ying or circumventing insecticide resistance. Dr Cowles developed a di agnostic assay to detect pyrethroid resistance in annual blue grass weevils that is being used in seven states. Indoor Fungi Studies: Dr. DeWei Li conducted research on indoor molds of human health concern, fungal succession on building materials, and infiltra tion of mushroom spores from outdoors into residences. Airborne fungi : Dr. Li continues to collect air samples bot h indoors and outdoors in Avon on a weekly basis. This long-term study st arted in fall 2004 to ch aracterize the airborne fungal concentration and compositions (types of fungi) in Connecticut, to assist establishing the baseline of exposure of residents/occupants to airborne fungi in CT, and to determ ine seasonal and di urnal patterns of airborne fungi, and at the same time to determine the relationship of airborne indoor fungi with outdoor ones. The samples are under ongoing analysis. Impact : Dr. Li assisted the Connecticut Health De partment with interpretation of a CDC NIOSH report on a mold-contaminated st ate building in Hartford. Hi s assistance should help reduce human exposure to environmental molds. Fungal succession on building materials : Dr. Li continues working on the project of fungal succession on drywall with water damage at different levels. The data showed that fungal population composition is positively related to the level and duration of water damage. With time, th e infested areas continue to The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 193 enlarge significantly, and fungal biodiversity has increased also. Fungal compositions and populations showed a succession patter n. Water-loving fungi, such as Stachybotrys chartarum , Chaetomium globosum and Ulocladium spp., appeared after long-term water damage and their colonies increased with time. Impact : The data indicated that severity of wate r damage has effects on the fungal composition on the wall units. Fungal spec ies composition evolved on the wa ll units with the duration of water damage. More water-loving fungi appear under long-term water damage. These data are critical to Indoor Air Quality professionals, certifie d industrial hygienists , and public health professionals for determining the time line of water damage. Stachybotrys and Memnoniella biosystematics study: Specimens of Stachybotrys and Menoniella were borrowed on loan from herbaria: in addition to BPI (USA), DAOM (Canada), IMI (UK), and CUP (Cornell University), more type specimens were borrowed from PDD (New Zealand, and Thailand for the study of biosystematic s. Six isolates and three isolates of each species were purchased from UAMH (Univers ity of Alberta) and ATCC (American Type Culture Collection), respectively. All specimens and isolates were examined morphologically. DNA of five isolates was sequenced in collabo ration with Robert Marra. ITS1 and ITS2 sequence data of 2 isolates from UAMH showed that they are Stachybotrys eucylindrospora . However, their conidial morphol ogical characters indicate that they might be a different taxon. Impact: The newly described species, S. eucylindrospora, is new to science. In addition, the study demonstrated the importance of working w ith type specimens for either classic fungal taxonomy or biosystematics research. Fungal taxonomists will change behavior from the examination of local specimens to examining herbarium specimens, especially type specimens, to correctly evaluate fungal taxa. The results al so raise the question whether ITS1 and ITS2 are sufficient for studying fungi at species level, as currently believed, and the use of ITS1 and ITS2 for fungal phylogenetic studies should be re-evaluated. Metarhiziopsis microspora, a new pathogen of hemlock scale 194 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Fungal biodiversity st udy in Connecticut: Dr. De-Wei Li and his colleagues are collect ing fungal specimens fr om various locations in CT. One specimen collected in the woods on CAES Valley Lab propert y is an undescribed species. It was named as Goidanichiella cylindrospora in a paper which will be published in Mycotaxon this summer. Dr. R. Cowles collected a specimen from the elongated hemlock scale, which is another undescribed species. In a coll aboration of R. Cowles, C. R. Vossbrinck, and Dr. Li, the fungus was described as a new genus and a new species (Metarhiziopsis microspora ). This fungus is a pathogen of the elongated heml ock scale. Two more undescribed species are under study. These undescribed specie s are new to science. Clearl y, the bio-resources in CT are not fully studied. Fungal biodiversit y is closely related to plants and their habitats. Any change in environment, climate, and vegetation may have significant effects on fungi and lead to disappearance of some fungi. We have good invent ories of plants and animals in CT, but not that of fungi. It has been near ly one century since the last funga l survey in CT, it is the time to conduct a thorough fungal biodiversi ty study in CT before it is too late for conserving endangered fungal species. Impact: Metarhiziopsis microspora could be a potential new biocontrol agent for the elongated hemlock scale. Other new species, as yet undi scovered, may be present in CT and may have utility as biocontrol agents or be useful for other purposes. Root tip galls on salt marsh cordgrass caused by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne spartinae Salt Marsh Decline : Sudden Wetland Dieback (SWD) has recently come to the attention of scientists in New England. It consists of the ra pid disappearance of salt marsh Spartina alterniflora grass, resulting in barren mudflat that is often recogn izable by remnant peat. SWD has occurred from Louisiana to Maine affecting low and high ma rsh sites. In New England, SWD was first The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 195 reported along the south shore of Cape Cod in 2002 where approximately 12% of emergent marsh has been converted to mudflats. SW D sites along the tidal rivers draining into Connecticut's Long Island Sound were reported in 2003. Subsequently, dieback sites have been found in all coastal New England states. Drs. LaMondia and Elmer discovered that a plant parasitic root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne spartinae, was associated with declining Spartina plants in SWD sites, but absent from sites wh ere no SWD occurred. This nematode has been reported from other sites along the Atlantic, but this was the first report from New England. We determined that the nematode reproduced on Spartina alterniflora but not other salt marsh sampled plants along transects in the low marsh from m ean low tide to mean high tide and determined that nematode populations increased with distance from mean low tide and were greatest at mean high tide where Spartina may be in decline.. We also recovered M. spartinae for the first time from short form S. alterniflora plants in the high marsh above the mean high tide level. A survey of healthy and SWD sites in CT and MA was in itiated and controlled interaction experiments conducted to determine if the nematode is associ ated with SWD sites or with other pathogens. Impact: These results, in combinati on with studies of pathogenic Fusarium species by Dr. Elmer, may determine whether pathogens play a role in the decline of this important and productive habitat. Biodiesel oilseed crops Recently there has been increased interest in the United States in the development of alternative energy sources and fuels. The Connec ticut Legislature has requested that The Station investigate oilseed crops for biodiesel fuels. To this end, Dr. LaMondia is evaluating alternative fuel oilseed crops either as main season summer cr ops or as winter cover crops with spring seed harvest. Biodiesel is an alternative, renewabl e fuel from vegetable oils pressed from oilseed crops. Biodiesel fuels can be used for transpor tation, as a source of hom e heating oil, or for electrical generation. The oilseed crops used for producing biodiesel are typically soybean or canola (also called rapeseed), Brassica napus . These crops are not high value and may not compare well with many higher-value crops grown in Connecticut. National average yields and price per acre (as reported by the National Agricultu ral Statistics Service) for canola and soybean for 2006 are about $150 for canola and $375 per acre fo r soybean. Therefore, there would likely need to be other reasons for growing these crops in addition to value as an oilseed feedstock. Dr. LaMondia is conducting research on the use of oils eed plants in integrated pest management. For example, canola/rapeseed oilseed crops may manage plant parasitic nematodes in soil. Brassica plants such as canola or rapeseed produce glucosinolates that hydrolyze to breakdown products such as isothiocyanates, cyanates and nitriles that may be toxic to certain nematode and fungal plant pathogens. Isothiocya nate is one of the active ingred ients of soil fumigants. The use of plants or plant products incorporated into soil to de liver these breakdown products to control pests is termed biofumigation. Soyb eans do not produce compounds for biofumigation, but have value in IPM as they can be grown as summer rotation crops, increase soil nitrogen levels, and manage weeds. Soybeans can be gr own without fertilizers, compete well with weeds and allow use of herbicides with different activities. Soybean and Brassica meals have value as 196 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 organic fertilizers. About one million pounds of organic meal-based fertilizers (primarily cottonseed meal) are used each year in the C onnecticut River Valley. Some growers are now producing and using their own soybean s as fertilizer supplements. During 2006, Dr. LaMondia determined crop yiel ds of both soybean and canola/rapeseed in field plots at the Lockwood a nd Windsor farms. The small pl ot yields compared well with national average yields. In 2007, different canola and rapeseed cu ltivars, as well as yellow and oriental mustards were grown to produce meals with different types and amounts of glucosinolates. The effect of six Brassica seed meal amendments on the viability of northern root-knot nematode ( Meloidogyne hapla ) juveniles was from four Brassica napus cultivars, one B. juncea cv and one Sinapis alba cv were evaluated at rates of 0, 1, 2, and 4 mg per cm3 soil. Root-knot nema tode control differed between seed meals and nematode control ranged from 6 to 93%. In other experiments, seed meals were heated to denature the plant enzymes that break down glucosinolates to the active chemicals or not treated, and then enzyme was added to bioassay vials or not. The heat treatment did not affect results; however, the add ition of enzyme to soil resulted in a significant increase in nematode control. These results indi cate that certain de-oiled seed meals were more effective against root-knot nematodes and that wh ile not necessary for ac tivity, the addition of myrosinase enzymes to bioassay soils resulted in an increase in nematode control. Future research in cooperation with the Departments of Analytical Chemistry and Biochemistry and Genetics will seek to identify and over-express the responsible glucosinolate compounds. Impact: These crops may maintain soil quality, protec t farm sustainability by adding integrated pest management tools to manage weeds, pat hogens and pests, and a dditionally reduce soil, groundwater and air pollution by decreasing the use of soil-applied pesticides such as fumigants to control plant pests. Combining Canola oilseed plots for biodiesel production The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 197 Blue-mold resistant broadleaf tob acco plots at the Valley Laboratory Tobacco pathology A number of diseases can cause serious losse s to the cigar wrapper tobacco types grown in the Connecticut River Valley and are being he ld in check by multiple approaches, but Dr. LaMondia's research is emphasi zing breeding for plant resistan ce to pathogens. The breeding program seeks to develop resist ance to virus, and Peronospora tabacina (blue mold) for both shade and broadleaf types. The development and deployment of resistant plants is the most effective, economical and environmentally safe means of managing disease. 198 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Sporulating Tobacco Blue Mold caused by Peronospora tabacina Blue mold has been a recurring problem in Connecticut from 1997 through 2007, causing losses up to the tens of millions of dollars annually. Grower education about spray timing and coverage has greatly reduced blue mold severity in recent years. Tobacco lines with resistance to blue mold were collected from different sour ces, crossed to CT types, selected over ten generations and evaluated under field conditions in Windsor. Blue mold incidence was compared between a susceptible commercial cultiv ar with and without f ungicides and resistant lines. Healthy leaves harvested over the length of the epidemic were nearly double for resistant lines grown without fungicide a pplication compared to susceptib le plants with commercial standard fungicides applied. The average numbers of lesions per leaf, lesi on size, and number of spores produced per cm2 reduced for resistant lines. Advan ced F1 male-sterile hybrid broadleaf and shade disease-resistant lines were distribut ed to growers for commercial evaluation during the 2007 season. The lines appeared to have pot ential for commercial produc tion, so seed of the best two lines was increased and will be tested again in 2008. Fusarium wilt increased in severity during the 1980's and early 1990's, causing up to 20% crop losses on broadleaf tobacco. The developm ent and release of wilt-resistant broadleaf cultivars has avoided at least $5 million per year in losses due to this disease each year since 1992. Production of CAES wilt-resistant cultivars has reduced the spread of the pathogen and kept infested fields in production without soil fumigation. All advanced shade and broadleaf lines under development continue to be screened in the field for high levels of wilt resistance. In the past year we demonstrated that Fusarium can be seed-borne and spread through plant propagation, explaining the speed of spread and extent of infested fields throughout the valley. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 199 The tobacco cyst nematode on roots and stunting symptoms in the field The tobacco cyst nematode (TCN) increases Fusarium wilt of broadleaf tobacco and reduces shade tobacco growth and leaf yield (l osses of up to 15%). Single-gene resistance to G. t. tabacum has been transferred to shade and broadleaf tobaccos using both a pedigree breeding program with repeated backcrossing to Connecticut types as well as a bulk system of modified single seed descent. Tobacco cyst nematode sh ade tobacco lines are being crossed with blue mold-resistant parents to select for resistance to both pathogens. In field evaluations, these resistant lines reduced tobacco cyst nematode popul ations by 60 to 80%, similar to the effects of soil fumigation with a broad spectrum nematicide. The deployment of TCN-resistant cultivars would reduce human health risks, reduce enviro nmental exposure to larg e amounts of fumigant nematicides and be more effective than soil fu migation while eliminati ng fumigation costs of approximately $500 per acre. In co operation with researchers from Virginia and North Carolina, Dr. LaMondia determined that gene(s) from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia (Php gene) that conferred resistance to race 0 of Phytophthora nicotianae also reduced cyst nematodes. These results indicate a close linkage or association between a likely single, dominant gene ( Php) for resistance to P. nicotianae and suppressed reproduction by the cyst nematodes G. t. solanacearum and G. t. tabacum . This gene or linked genes may result in an additional control of the cyst nematode and aid in understanding pleiotropic resistance to multiple pathogens. Tobacco leaf with green spot caused by Tobacco mosaic virus 200 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 From 2002 to 2007, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection resulted in significant commercial losses ($3 to $5 million) due to gree n spot development on TMV-susceptible shade and broadleaf tobacco. Our resear ch demonstrated the association of green spot with TMV, and determined that plant resistance was the single mo st important factor fo r reducing green spot. All new shade and broadleaf lines being produc ed are selected for single dominant gene resistance to TMV. Impact: The development and deployment of pathogen -resistant lines or cultivars will greatly reduce grower dependence on pesticides and allo w effective disease management with reduced costs, reduced environmental contamination and reduced grower exposure to health risks. Fusarium wilt resistance has avoi ded about $75 million in losses over the last 15 years while keeping fields in agriculture and maintaining ope n space. Blue mold resistance would reduce the number of fungicide applicati ons required at about $50 per acre per application. Tobacco cyst nematode resistance will eliminate the need for soil fumigation at $400 to $500 per acre per year. Weed research: Dr. Todd Mervosh conducts research on weed ma nagement in a variety of crop systems and at non-agricultural sites. In th e past year, his projects include d weed control experiments in ornamental plants grown in cont ainers, Christmas trees, and pum pkins. These experiments were conducted at the CAES Valley Laboratory in Windsor and/or in growers' fiel ds or nurseries. Dr. John Ahrens is a research partner in some experiments involving ornamentals and Christmas trees. In addition, Dr. Mervosh has projects underway to find effective and environmentally sound methods to control the following non-native i nvasive plants in natu ral areas or minimally managed habitats: common reed (phragmites), pale swallowwort, giant hogweed and Japanese stiltgrass. Nursery ornamental weed control: Drs. Mervosh and Ahrens conduct research as part of the USDA's IR-4 Ornamental Horticulture Program to evaluate tolerances of woody ornamental plants to herbicides that are not currently registered for use on these plants . According to the IR-4 protocol, herbicide treatments were applied over the top of plants at up to four ti mes the labeled dosage, and all treatments were applied again 8 weeks later. In this way, plant tolera nces are tested under a worst-case scenario for potential plant injury. If specific ornamental plants are highly tolerant of a herbicide tested, the IR-4 program will submit th is information to the EPA and to the herbicide manufacturer, who will consider additions to the he rbicide label. The eventual result is that nurseries will have more weed control options for the wide variety of plants they grow. Based on IR-4 protocols, we conducted an expe riment to evaluate tolerances of four woody plants to herbicides considered for possibl e ornamental use registrations. Plant injury was evaluated periodically on juniper, emeral d green arborvitae, spir ea and doublefile viburnum for up to 8 weeks after treatment applications. Sprayable treatments consisted of dimethenamid- p 5.9EC [BAS Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 201 flumioxazin 0.25G [BroadStar] as a standard. All herbicides were a pplied over the top of actively growing plants. In summary, all four container-grown shrubs in this experiment were susceptible to mesotrione sprays, whereas these species were quite tolerant of the other herbicide treatments. Dr. Mervosh also conducted experiments at th e Valley Laboratory in 2007 to evaluate several experimental granular formulations of the preemergence herbicides flumioxazin (BroadStar) and dimethenamid (Fr eeHand) for weed prevention and safety to several ornamental species grown in containers. The composition of inert ingredients in the granules controls the release rate of active ingredient (the herbicide) from the granules, thus affecting the herbicidal efficacy of each formulation. Impact: Flumioxazin has been recently registered for ornamentals, based in part on data from Connecticut. Field-grown Ornamentals: Drs. Mervosh and Ahrens conduct experiments each year to evaluate newly registered and experimental herbicides for efficacy and sa fety to woody ornamentals and conifers grown for Christmas trees. A preliminary experiment in 2007 revealed that fr aser firs were quite tolerant to the new herbicide mesotrione (register ed for use in corn and turfgrasses). Mesotrione is derived from a natural chemical produced by the bottlebrush shrub, and it was approved quickly by the U.S. EPA as a \"reduced risk pestic ide.\" Drs. Mervosh and Ahrens have initiated a large experiment at the Valley Lab to further in vestigate the herbicidal efficacy and safety of mesotrione and other new herbicides in plots co ntaining ten different c onifer species grown as nursery stock and/or Christmas trees, including spruce, fir, pine, arborvitae, yew and juniper species. Plants were transplanted into the field in April, and herbicide treatments were applied over the top of plants prior to or following emerge nce of weeds. Early evaluations indicate that mesotrione provides excellent control of the weed s present, and eight of the ten conifer species appear to be highly tolerant of mesotrione. This research will likely help lead to a registration for mesotrione use in conifer plantings. Mesotrione would be a more environmentally sound weed control option than some of the herbicides currently used in conifer fields. Invasive Plant Management: Pale Swallowwort: At the request of conservation officials at the Silvio Conte National Fish & Wildlife Refuge (U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service), Dr. Merv osh initiated an experiment in May 2007 to evaluate several treatments for control of pale swallowwort ( Cynanchum rossicum ), a non-native invasive plant, along the slope s of Mt. Tom near Holyoke, MA. Pale swallowwort is an herbaceous perennial vine in the milkweed famil y. The goal is to develop an ecologically sound control strategy to prevent pale swallowwort fr om overtaking small populations of rare native plants on the slopes. Various herbicide treatmen ts were applied in June and/or August 2007, and plots have been evaluated several times in 2007 and 2008. Final evaluations of pale 202 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 swallowwort population density, vigor, pod producti on and presence of other plant species will be done in August 2008. Impact: Conclusions from this study will be used by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and other government agencies in developing management plans for pale swallowwort on their lands. Mile-a-Minute fast-growing annual vine with sharp barbs on its stems. It is a recent invader in Connecticut, and so far has only been found in relatively small infestations in the southwest corn er and a few other sites in the western half of the state. At the request of Mad Gardeners Inc., a gardeni ng and conservation group based in western CT, Dr. Mervosh initiated an experime nt in the spring of 2007 on a New Milford property that has had a sizeable infestation of mile-a-minute since 2005. Treatments included various herbicides (preemergence and/or posteme rgence), periodic mowing, repeated tillage, a 4\" layer of coarse mulch, and landscape fabric. With the exception of the mulch layer, the non- chemical treatments were effective at controllin g mile-a-minute but most of these treatments are primarily useful for small infestations. Applicat ion of a selective herbic ide may be necessary for larger infestations. Pre-emergence treatments of pendimethalin or oxyfluorfen prevented early post-emergence applic ation of imazapic provided season-long control, and an application of triclopyr prior to fruit fo rmation was effective. Other herbicide treatments were either ineffective or not selective enough. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 203 Impact: Results of this experiment will be used to develop plans for controlling mile-a-minute where it exists, and prev enting this invasive plant from spreading. Giant Hogweed: Dr. Mervosh has been involved for several y ears in a state-wide program designed to locate and eradicate giant hogweed ( Heracleum mantegazzianum ), a large perennial in the parsnip family. Giant hogweed is also listed as a federal noxious weed because of the human health risk it poses; exposure to its sap can cause severe skin burns or eye damage. He helps identify plants reported to be giant hogweed. Many reported plan ts are actually cow parsnip, a native plant closely related to gi ant hogweed, or other species that are similar in appearance. Impact: Dr. Mervosh provides educati on about control information for the landowner, or with permission of the property owner, eradicates the giant hogweed plants with directed sprays of triclopyr herbicide, reducing potential health impacts to CT citizens. Japanese Stiltgrass: Japanese stiltgrass ( Microstegium vimineum ) is a relatively new invasive plant in Connecticut, primarily in floodplain and in the un derstory of forests. This non-native annual grass spreads rapidly and forms dense stands that crowd out nativ e plants and suppress regeneration of tree seedlings . Along with Dr. Jeffrey Wa rd and his research group, Dr. Mervosh recently initiated an extensive study of non-chemical and herbicide-based treatments for management of Japanese stiltgrass in a woodland along the Connect icut River in East Haddam, CT. The study will continue until th e fall of 2009. The parcels of land are owned by the East Haddam Land Trust and The Nature Conservancy, and the CT Department of Environmental Protection will provide funding for th e project. The objective of this study is to identify at least one non-chemical and at leas t one herbicide-based control method that will provide excellent control of Japa nese stiltgrass at reasonable co st with minimal harm to native vegetation. This information will be highly usef ul for the DEP, The Nature Conservancy, land trusts and other organizations that need to de velop management plans fo r Japanese stiltgrass. Christmas Trees In an experiment begun in 2001 in fertile so il at the Valley Laboratory, Mr. Rathier is finding that Fraser fir Christmas tr ees that have never been fertilized differ very little in size and visual quality when compared to fertilized trees. While natural fertilities of other soils may not be as great as those at the Valley Lab, these re sults suggest that many growers could at least reduce their fertilizer use without affecting their yield or tree qualit y. Results of this experiment could impact the industry by helping growers reali ze the fertility values of their soils, possibly reducing fertilizer expenses and nut rient loss to surface and ground water. In another experiment begun in 2001 at the Valley Lab, Mr. Rathier has found that neither Christmas tree transplant survival nor subsequent growth and quality is improved by biostimulants, mycorrhizal fungi and planting gels so ld as soil amendments for use at planting. 204 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Grading bare-root transplants by genetically related root volu me however did reveal that transplants with greater volumes grow faster than those with smaller volumes, gaining a year or more before harvest. A similar experiment conducted by Mr. Rathier a nd Dr. Cowles revealed that root volume differences induced mechanica lly (by white grub injury) resulted in similar growth differences. These results could im pact the industry by eliminating expensive amendments at planting and zone planting by root grade to allow for quicker rotations. The impact of transplant survival expe riments should be to help growers optimize survival and avoid costly replanti ng and losing time in production areas. Tobacco nutrition One shade tobacco grower in the valley is growing the crop under plasticulture (e.g. plastic film mulch for weed control and leachin g management and drip irrigation for water and nutrient management). This method is appropriate for Connecticut tobacco but is complicated by the fact that the quality of our crops is linked to the traditional use of natural sources of nitrogen such as cottonseed meal or castor pomace. Conv entional culture allows for the application of these meal types of fertilizers prior to planting and in side-dre ssings throughout the first 30 days after transplant in the field. Formation of raised beds and installation of the drip irrigation and plastic mulch limit the use of meals to the prepla nt period only. Determining how much meal to add in advance and its rate of mineralization under the plasti c is a significant challenge. Additionally, amounts and timing of supplemental n itrogen applied throug h the drip irrigation needs to be determined. This study will contin ue for a few more years to work out all the possible variations of preplant and supplemental nitrogen and thei r affects on yield and quality. The major impact of this experiment will be to help growers reduce losses of nitrate nitrogen and other solutes to ground water, redu ce fertilizer costs and improve the ability to grow a uniform crop. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Requests for information: A total of 7,952 inquiries were answered at the Valley Laboratory during the past year. The majority of these queries (70%) were answer ed by both Mr. Thomas Rathier (4,832), and Mr. John Winiarski (838) in the inqu iry office, and by Drs. LaMondi a (12%), and Mervosh (7%). About 68% of the requests for information were from the public sector; the remainder was from commercial growers and pest control operators. Inquiries by subject categ ory were as follows: arthropod pests (33%); plant dis eases (10%); general horticult ural information (28%); soil fertility and water issues (16%); pesticide use (8%); weed control (3%); and mammals, birds and reptiles (2%). Continuing concern among tobacco growers over tobacco mosaic virus and the blue mold epidemic in the Connecticut River Valley spawne d a large number of i nquiries to Dr. James LaMondia and Thomas Rathier. Dr. LaMondia in itiated and maintained the Connecticut River Valley Blue Mold Web Site to keep tobacco grow ers current with the prog ress of the disease in North America, and the potential exposure and management options in the Valley. He also The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 205 assisted with a Section 18 registration for Quad ris and Manzate fungicides for control of blue mold in shade tobacco. Inquiry office perspective: Commercial agriculture: Mr. Rathier made 60 field visits to co mmercial and municipal fields, nurseries, greenhouses, Christmas tree farms, forests and pr ivate landscapes to diagnose complex problems firsthand. Some problems were solved during th e visits but many required taking plant and soil samples for laboratory analyses a nd subsequent reports to the gr owers. Most inquiries from commercial agriculture came duri ng grower visits to the diagnos tic lab or during phone calls. Many diagnoses were centered on plant respon ses to weather conditions. The 2007 growing season started with frequent cool, very wet c onditions in May and early June which got most annual crops off to very slow start. Fr om mid June though mid October, a prolonged, progressive drought dominated gr owing conditions. Moderate amounts of rainfall throughout the fall helped some woody plants recover but drought related pr oblems were reported throughout the year. Winter temperatures were moderate but several frosts and freezes in early to mid spring resulted in losses to fruit crops and early planted field crops. Newly planted and mature Christmas trees, a crop that rarely receives irrigation, suffered significant drought-related losses with newly planted young trees dyi ng outright and larger trees losing needles and new growth. White pine we evil, Pales weevil, spruce spider mites and elongate hemlock scale and cryptomeria scale were the insect pests most often reported. Needle diseases (Rhabdocline and Rhizos phaera needlecasts a nd spruce needle rust were the most reported problems. Winter injuries were observed on overwi ntering woody plants in production with desiccation injuries occurring on broadleaf ev ergreens and conifers. Woody and herbaceous plants growing in containers outdoors in many nurseries experienced problems resulting from irrigation water shortages that limited leaching capabilities resulting in elevated soluble salt levels in potting media. Freeze and frost injuries and subsequent bacteria l or fungal blights and leaf spots resulted in significan t losses, especially in lilacs and rhododendrons. Continued cool and wet conditions in the spring of 2008 hampered nutrient release from sl ow release fertilizers resulting in some off-color new growth. Greenhouse growers experienced a bright though difficult to h eat late winter season and continued bright conditions resulted in fewer root diseases such as Pythium and foliar diseases, especially Botrytis blight. The marketing s eason for bedding plants was marred by a few rainy, cold weekends which limited sales. Golf courses and turf farms experienced drought-related problems during summer and fall 2007, demanding aggressive irrigation strategies but foliar and root diseases were quite limited. Forage crops grew slowly during the dr ought and most growers were hampered by rains with the hay harvest on time in June 2008. Sila ge crop harvests were reduced in 2007 due to drought conditions. 206 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 Small fruit harvests were average during th e 2007 season if irrigation was available. Spring 2008 saw frost damage to strawberries bu t difficult conditions for harvesting and yields were average. Tree fruits experienced an aver age harvest in 2007 with few foliar diseases. Pollination in the spring of 2008 was limited in some areas due to cool, cloudy weather. Vegetable growers experienced good harvests in 2007 as long as irrigation was available. Bacterial spot and wilt diseases were less of a problem for peppers and tomatoes. Growers using plasticulture or row covers saw fewer problems desp ite a colder than normal start. The planting season in 2007 was plagued by prolonged by col d, wet soil conditions. Many growers had to replant fields. Tobacco acreages did well in 2007 if irrigation was available and leaf quality and yields were the best in several years, especially for broadleaf tobacco. Blue mold appeared in only a few isolated spots throughout th e Connecticut River Valley with nearly no effect on yields thanks to greater attention to fungicide spray co verage and the widespread use of the fungicides Acrobat or Forum. Ordinary insect problems, such as budworms and aphids were present in many fields. The transplant production season in spring 2007, as was the case in the three previous seasons, was hampered by significant pe riods of cool, dark conditions, which limited rapid growth in the greenhouse. Also pr esent in spring 2007 was black root rot Pythium and Rhioctonia resulting in substantial losses of transplants. Presently, no fungici de is registered for management of this disease but growers can successfully use cultural methods to manage the disease. COMMERCIAL AND HOME LANDSCAPES As with commercial agriculture, weather c onditions throughout th e bulk of 2007 started out cool and moist but quickly progressed to drought conditions. Drought injury to woody landscape plants became obvious even during the wi nter with injuries to broadleaf and needled evergreens and freeze injuries to mature wood we re seen as spring 2008 unfolded. Arborvitae was the top problem plant with many reasons for browned foliage. Vascular wilts, most commonly caused by Verticillium, were diagnosed in many different woody plants but most commonly in maples. More than likely the infections were made worse by the droughty conditions in this and previous seasons. Home landscapers reported significant difficultie s with transplanted trees and shrubs, due mostly to the lack of proper care. Transplant shock or failure remains the single most important cause of losses in landscapes. In some cas es, field dug shrubs and trees did not have enough roots to support the transplant and soil conditions did not allow timely growth of new roots. Container-grown plants may have had too many r oots that didn't allow the plant to grow new roots until too late. The highly porous condition s of container growing media create conditions where root growth dominates the space within the container and the plants do well while under daily irrigation. But once that r oot ball is placed in a typical landscape soil, its needs are no longer met. The plant lives on the carbohydrate re serves in the roots and stems and often do not grow new roots. Landscapers and homeowners need to take better care to prevent or limit this condition. Home landscapers with frequent irrigation habits also reported many cases of slime The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 207 molds growing on mulches, especially wood chips or locally produced bark mulch that contained large amounts of wood. The presence of wood in the mulch allows the mold fungi to grow more rapidly and the moist conditions of regular irrigation created the ideal environment for growth. Artillery fungus that \"shoots\" s pore cases towards light colors su ch as structures and vehicles, also grow well in these conditions and was widely reported. Also a result of previous dark, moist growing seasons, algae and lichens were re ported on a variety of surfaces including trees, paved areas, bare soil, roofs and siding. Hemlock woolly adelgid has rebounded quite successfully in 2007-2008 after three difficult winters in a row. Cool moist condi tions in the spring 2007 growing season and a moderate winter of 2007-2008 allowed many hemloc ks to recover and grow more vigorously. Also plaguing hemlocks and other conifers were elongate hemlock scale and spruce spider mites. Gypsy moths were not as widespread in most areas around the state, the result of wet conditions in June 2007. Sprays were typically not needed but homeowner s and landscapers are being cautioned to scout fo r egg masses in the coming winter a nd to be prepared to spray next year. Spring 2008 conditions favored the return of natural controls. Also observed in the spring of 2008 were forest tent caterpi llars. Orange striped oakwor ms were reported in Eastern Connecticut. Other arthropods of note thr oughout 2007 were white pine weevil and Pales weevil. Hard pines were once again infested w ith European sawflies, tip moths and pine shoot moths. Leafhoppers, lace bugs, arborvitae leaf miners were more plentiful and significant defoliation by assorted caterpillars and sa wflies was observed on d eciduous and evergreen plants. Also noticed were azalea bark scale, co ttony camellia scale, assorted lecanium scales and white prunicola scale. Hibiscus sawfly and l ily leaf beetle, both newcomers to Connecticut continued to establish populations in Connecticut. Vibur num aphids and assorted eriophyid mites were more numerous in the spring of 2007. Diseases were less plentiful in 2007, but spri ng 2008 saw a return of foliar disorders such as leaf spots, blights and anthracnose. Anth racnoses have been widespread and especially problematic to sycamores, oaks, maples a nd birches. Cedar apple rust and other gymnosporangium rusts were quite common on many crabapples, hawthorn and shadbush. Stress-related cankers were reported on many trees, especially ornamental cherries, maples and beeches. Powdery mildew was a problem on many different broadleaf trees and shrubs as well as herbaceous plants. Conifers were plagued by needlecasts, needle ru sts, and tip blights. Home lawns experienced dryer conditions th roughout the summer of 2007 that resulted in fewer diseases but more substantial losses due to drought. Disease pressure was much lower on high maintenance lawns, but summer patch, dollar spot, leaf spots, Pythiu m and red thread were all observed. Large numbers of scarab beetle s adults were reported in the spring of 2007 and white grub injury was widespread in droughty la wns. Chinch bugs were a problem also. Bluegrass billbug outbreaks have been observed on a few occasions and only on sodded areas. Ground ivy, violets, corn speedwell and yellow nu tsedge were the most important weeds in lawns. Poor crabgrass management was a common observation due mostly to home landscapers applying pre-emergent controls too early in the season follo wed by heavy rains and cool conditions. Crabgrass germinated late in mo st lawns and management compounds were below 208 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 the seed by then. Moss colonization of poor turf areas received plenty of attention from homeowners, as well. Management strategies offered for all pests include cultural and sanitary approaches as the primary effort with low impact pesticides as a second effort, and las tly, stronger pesticides when other approaches do not succeed. Wildlife and Structural Pests Animal problems were numerous throughout the year with most inquiries concerning squirrels, chipmunks, moles, voles, ra bbits, woodchucks, skunks and snakes. Insects that bother humans were of concer n to many homeowners. Mosquito problems were reduced in the spring of 2007 due to redu ced rainfall. Many ticks were submitted for identification. All black legged ticks were forw arded to the lab in New Haven for spirochete analysis. Wasps, especially German yellow jack ets and solitary ground bees were bothersome to many. Ground dwelling bees have been increasing in numbers in recent years causing problems for home landscapes in the spring but perhaps filling a niche for pollination needs. An interesting observation is an increase in oil or blis ter beetles in the genus Meloe in the fall. Some of these beetles are pr edaceous on ground bees. Among arthropods found inside structures, carpe nter ants, termites, black and varied carpet beetles, ground beetles, gr ass carrier wasps, cigarette be etles, larder beetles, acorn weevils, sawtoothed grain beetle, confused flour b eetles and spiders received the most attention. Also noted were multicolored Asian lady beetle s, squash bugs, western conifer seed bugs, boxelder bugs, clover mites, assorted food infesti ng beetles, ground rove beetles, Indian meal moths and centipedes and millipedes. A continued trend of bed bugs being submitted in greater numbers continued in the past year. Where management strategies for indoor and other structural pests were necessary, most homeowners chose baiting and/or san itation rather than pesticide use. Soil testing: A total of 5,086 soil tests were expertly perf ormed by Mr. John Winiarski during the past year. About 65% were performed for commerc ial growers, 30% for homeowners, 3% for municipalities, and the remai nder for Station research. Of the 3,294 commercial samples submitted, 55% were for landscapers; 22% for tobacco growers; 8 % for vegetable growers, 5% for nursery growers; 2% for golf course superintendents; 2% for Christmas tree growers; 2% for fruit growers, and the remainder for others. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 209 Gordon S. Taylor Conference Room: Many agricultural organizations used the c onference room at the Valley Laboratory regularly for their meetings. During the past year, 28 different groups used the room on 93 occasions. Our most frequent users were the C onnecticut Farmland Trust, Farm Wine Council, the CT Wine Association, C onnecticut Rhododendron Society, Connecticut Chapter of the National Organic Farmers Association, Connectic ut Department of Environmental Protection, Connecticut Farm Fresh, Connecticut Greenhouse Grower's Association, Connecticut Nursery and Landscape Association, and Connecticut Invasive Plants Workgroup. Jane Morrison scheduled the appointments and Ja mes Preste arranged the furniture for scheduled meetings and ensured that the room wa s available after hours. 210 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station\u2014Record of the Year 2007-2008 BULLETINS OF THE CONN ECTICUT AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION PUBLISHED DURING 2007-2008 1009 Seed Germination and Purity Analysis - 2007. 13 pages.
