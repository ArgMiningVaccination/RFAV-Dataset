The safer-at-home orders issued in March by the city and Dallas County to limit the spread of COVID-19 devastated his business. The chef and owner of Salum restaurant filed a claim under his business interruption insurance policy. It was quickly denied, even though local authorities had shut him down. \"It was just very confusing,\" said Salum, who now has limited patio seating available. Salum isn't alone. Small businesses across North Texas and the nation have awakened to the stark reality that they are in for a lengthy fight after their insurance companies denied their business interruption insurance claims. He and at least four other North Texas business owners, including other restaurateurs and dentists, have sued their insurance companies to try to collect what they say they're owed. Legal experts are watching to see how the courts will sort out the legal quagmire, complicated by the absence of any case law. Business advocates say the insurance industry and its powerful lobby are trying to escape liability during the global public health crisis. But insurers argue that the policies were never intended to cover catastrophic losses from a pandemic, and the number and extent of the claims would put them out of business. Salum said he's been paying premiums for years and wasn't asking to be paid the policy limits, just \"what is right.\" \"You feel they only take and don't give anything,\" said Salum, whose New American restaurant on Cole Avenue is struggling to stay afloat with take-out orders. \"I felt like it wasn't fair.\" Matthew McCarley, a lawyer with Fears Nachawati who's handling Salum's lawsuit, said insurance companies had clearly been preparing for the wave of claims and \"knew it was coming.\" Businesses closed not because of a virus but as a result of local government orders, McCarley said, adding that he can't think of a better reason to pay the claims. \"That's the reason why they've lost the money,\" he said. [What you need to know about coronavirus](/news/public-health/2020/03/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-coronavirus/) Lengthy fight ahead McCarley said insurers have millions of dollars in reserves \u2014 to pay for exactly the type of damage the coronavirus pandemic has wrought. Even if carriers are forced to pay, limits on payouts will ease their financial burden, he said. \"It's not our goal to bankrupt the insurance industry,\" McCarley said. \"We want our clients to be paid.\" Albert Betts Jr., executive director of the Insurance Council of Texas, said in a statement that his organization is being \"bombarded\" daily with questions about business interruption insurance and \"allegations that the industry is not honoring its contracts.\" \"Nothing could be further from the truth, and some of the ideas being floated would severely damage the solvency and stability of this industry,\" he said. Dallas-based law firm Thompson Knight issued a recent client alert, saying such policies typically require \"physical loss\" or damage to property. Shelley Glazer, a Thompson Knight lawyer, said policyholders are arguing that the coronavirus \"sticks to surfaces\" and \"stays airborne,\" which has caused damage. She said litigation could drag on for years. \"They are just starting to percolate through the courts,\" she said about the lawsuits. \"Only time will tell as to how it sorts out.\" Small business owners like Salum say they don't have years \u2014 they need help now. Vandelay Hospitality Group LP, a Dallas restaurant company that does business as Hudson House, said in its lawsuit against its insurer that policyholders are being \"forced to accept low-ball settlement offers\" out of the fear that \"their insurer will drag out proceedings well past the insured's ability to remain financially viable.\" Glazer noted that lawmakers in Washington are working on two bills that could help businesses. The Pandemic Risk Reinsurance Act of 2020 would create a federal program to compensate businesses that were forced to temporarily cease operations due to a pandemic or infectious disease outbreak. Total industry losses would have to reach $250 million to trigger payments. Liability would be capped at $500 million. And the Business Interruption Insurance Coverage Act of 2020 would require insurers to pay business interruption claims arising from \"viral pandemics, forced closures of businesses, mandatory evacuations, and public safety power shut-offs.\" Quick denials David A. Sampson, president and CEO of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, said any attempts to rewrite laws to pay business interruption claims could have \"dramatic repercussions\" for everyone with insurance. Sampson said it would threaten insurers' ability to \"make good\" on existing policies. \"Insurance stability is especially important in a time of increased natural catastrophes,\" he said in a statement. \"Hurricane season is around the corner, and wildfires pose a threat year-round.\" The National Association of Insurance Commissioners also urged Congress not to act rashly during the crisis. Business interruption policies were never intended to cover losses related to \"communicable diseases,\" the association said. \"Insurance works well and remains affordable when a relatively small number of claims are spread across a broader group, and therefore it is not typically well suited for a global pandemic where virtually every policyholder suffers significant losses at the same time for an extended period,\" the association said. Some insurance companies didn't wait long to deny claims. It took Aspen American Insurance Company less than two hours to deny a Minnesota dentist's claim in March, said Mark Lanier, a Houston lawyer, in his lawsuit against the company in federal court in Dallas. Lanier also said in his lawsuit on behalf of Christie Jo Berkseth-Rojas that the insurance industry recognized as early as 2006 that a virus can cause physical damage to a property. Lombardi's Inc., a Dallas restaurant owner, also got the bad news the same day it filed an insurance claim in March, according to its lawsuit against Indemnity Insurance Company of North America. An adjuster called to tell Lombardi's that the insurer was \"going by the 'black and white' written word in the policy and that there were no physical damages,\" according to the lawsuit. Lombardi's said in the suit that the insurer acted so quickly, it \"could not have done a proper or thorough investigation.\" Lombardi's told its insurer in an email at the time that it was \"less than twenty-four hours from having to let go of over 700 employees.\" Contamination Salum and other local businesses say the coronavirus contaminated their property, effectively damaging it and requiring deep cleaning. Travelers had not filed a response to the Salum lawsuit as of Friday afternoon. In response to questions from The Dallas Morning News, the company issued a statement: \"In our standard commercial property policies that include business interruption coverage, we have very specific exclusions stating that losses resulting from a virus or bacteria are not covered.\" The Salum lawsuit said the coronavirus caused property damage because of \"the staying power of the virus and the communicability of disease from exposure to the surface of objects and materials.\" The virus remains on surfaces for weeks \u2014 up to 28 days under some estimates, the lawsuit said, and such contamination poses a significant risk of infection. \"China, Italy, France, and Spain have implemented the cleaning and fumigating of public areas prior to allowing them to re-open publicly due to the intrusion of microbials,\" the lawsuit said. \"The physical contamination of surfaces with communicable coronavirus is a well-recognized cause of physical damage and a reason that civil authorities have issued quarantine orders.\" The lawsuit said Travelers denied Salum's claim in a March 30 letter \"without any meaningful investigation\" and that the insurer said the policy only covers contamination by pollutants. Travelers said it has told all of its policyholders that its policies do not cover loss of income due to a \"general fear of contamination,\" nor for \"cancellations, suspensions and shutdowns that are implemented to limit the spread of the coronavirus.\" Salum said some of his staff have been with him since the beginning. The 30-year culinary veteran plans to continue updating his menu every month and buying fresh local produce. He is mostly doing takeout and delivery business. \"They are my family,\" he said about his employees. \"We're doing all we can and just trying to stay positive.\" This story was updated to reflect the fact that Salum now has limited patio seating available.
