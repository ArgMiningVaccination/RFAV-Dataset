Homeopathy is holistic because it treats the person as a whole, rather than focusing on a specific diseased part or a labeled sickness. The holistic system of medicine provides deep healing and works on your body, mind and emotions. In Homeopathy, disease or symptoms are regarded as the body's warning signs designed to gain our attention. The homeopathic treatment addresses the root cause of the disease or symptoms by activating the body's own powers of self-regulation and provides the opportunity for significant healing. Homeopathic medicines are natural, non-toxic, do not create side-effects and do not interfere with, but rather complement your current medical treatment. In homeopathy every individual is regarded as unique and is given the remedy for their particular physical and emotional condition. There are two main categories of treatment in Homeopathic Medicine; i.e., acute and chronic. Acute treatment is for illness of recent onset; it may be self-limited (for example, the common cold), or it may progress if not treated (for example, pneumonia). In such an illness the body might overcome the illness, a cold for example, sooner or later, but the appropriate medicine gently stimulates the body to recover more quickly and efficiently. Chronic or constitutional treatment targets a long standing or a recurrent health problem. The length of treatment and the challenge to achieve positive results is affected by many factors, including the nature of the problem, the early health history, the family medical history, previous treatment and the person's inherent constitutional strength. The goal is to help the person to return to a state of well-being through individualized homeopathic treatment. Benefits of Homeopathic Medicine include... - Promotes the body's own healing mechanism - Supports and improves immune system - Complements current medical treatment - Can eliminate or reduce drug dependency - 100% natural and non-toxic with no adverse side effects - Works on all levels (mind, emotions and physical body) - Individualized to a patient's particular physical and emotional conditions There are many areas where research has found Holistic Medicine to be potentially helpful, including but not limited to the following...
