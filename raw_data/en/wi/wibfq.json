It also provides guidance on who should perform breastof as palpation in symptomatic women and as follow-up tobreast cancer. Breast awareness The Government's Advisory Committee on breastCancer Screening first issued a policy statement on breast self examination and breast awareness in 1989. Breast self examination is monthly palpation performed by a woman at the same time each monthto a set method. The effectiveness of breast selfexamination in reducing mortality from breast cancerhas never been consistently demonstrated, in the UKor elsewhere .In addition it produces a high number of false positives and can induce unnecessary anxiety. Therefore, the Advisory Committee recommended that it should not be promoted as a screening procedure.Further policy advicel on breast awareness was issued in 1991. The Committee noted that over 90% of breast cancers were found by women themselves.Women should be conscious of. what was normal for them, about the feel and look of their breaststhroughout the menstrual cycle. They recommended that women, especially those aged over 40 years, should be aware of their breasts in such every day activities as bathing, showering and dressing. Theconcept of breast awareness is now widely acceptedFrom the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Nursing Officer Sir Kemeth Calman KCB MD PL/CMO/98/l PL/CNO/98/l Clinical Examination of the Breast For action All GPsAll Practice NursesMedical Directors of NHS Trusts Trust Nurse Executive Directors k'or mformatlon Chief Executives of HAsChief Executives of Trusts Directors of Breast Screening Units Regional Directors Regional Nurse DirectorsRoyal College of General Practitioners Royal College of NursingJoint Consultants CommitteeGeneral Medical ServicesCommitteeand encouraged. Screening by available every three years formammography, all women overis the age of 50, and remains the best method of identifying breast cancer at an early stage. Examination of the breast of the well women The Advisory Committee has received reports that some primary care nurses are being asked to examine well women's breasts as part of well women health checks. The Committee has therefore reviewed its advice on breast palpation. The Committee agreed that there was no evidence to support the efficacy of breast examination by health professionals of the well woman, which is liable to give false reassurance. The Committee therefore advised that palpation of the breast by either medical or nursing staff should not be included as part of routine health screening for women. Examination of the breast in symptomatic women The Royal College of Nursing guidance on breast palpation2 recommends that nurses should not undertake breast palpation, with the possible exception of breast care nurses with specialist training who include palpation as a significant part of their role and work within an environment providing immediate on site access to the full range of facilities necessary for breast cancer diagnosis. The Committee endorsed this advice. Therefore, clinical examination of the breast should not be delegated to a nurse in the primary care setting. Some studies are emerging which show that nurses working in a symptomatic breast unit with appropriate education and training in breast palpation are competent in detecting abnormalities. A further study is underway.Clinical Examination of the Breast PL/cMo19811 PL/CNO/98/ 1 2 February 1998 Page 2 of 3 For further information contact: Mrs Helen Shirley-Quirk Cancer Policy Team 316 Wellington House 133-155 Waterloo Road London SE1 8UGplease Request for further copies should be addressed to: Department of Health Mailings c/o Two Ten Communications Ltd Building 150 Thorp Arch Trading Estate Wetherby, West Yorkshire LS23 7EH quoting name and serial number appearing above.
