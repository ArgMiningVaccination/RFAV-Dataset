For example, changing your tactics to renewable energy systems and practices will provide reliable power supplies and reduce the need for imported fuels. Researchers are constantly investing their time and energy to find the best renewable energy sources that everyone can use. Here are the top four unheard-of alternative energy sources you can include daily to benefit the environment. 1. Solar Wind Solar wind power is a type of renewable energy source that combines the energy of wind and solar electric power. Because the sun's outer layer obtains 2 million degrees Fahrenheit, the sun's gravity cannot contain rapidly moving particles, causing them to stream away from the sun. Solar wind energy cultivates this stream into a hot and fast flow of magnetized gas. Since people need power when the sun isn't shining, tacking solar and wind energy together could save money on grid connections and battery costs, according to Scientific American. With the two technologies in tandem, they could serve as a better replacement for fossil fuels. 2. Algal Biofuels Algae are small aquatic organisms that can be found in oceans, lakes, and rivers and are known to use photosynthesis to convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into energy carbon dioxide. Biomass from algae can be used to extract oil and eventually convert it to a renewable biofuel. A significant advantage of using algae for biofuels is that we would not need to displace our food resources or compromise farmland. And, algae production can yield more energy compared to land-based crops, but with any sustainable technology, there will be challenges in production. 3. Geothermal Energy Geothermal energy uses heat stored under the Earth's surface to produce electricity. It involves digging deep holes into the ground to uncover hot water or steam. When drilling holes deep into the ground, it lets in steam or hot brine that flows freely and can heat buildings during wintertime. Geothermal plants are an essential component of turning turbines for electricity. The heat is vital for geothermal power plants because it activates the system to run smoothly. As a result, many industries have seen an increase in geothermal energy and a decrease in the use of fossil fuels and gas emissions. 4. Biomass Energy Also known as bioenergy, biomass energy is created from plant or animal waste and generates electricity through direct combustion. Burning biomass in a boiler produces high-pressure steam, which then spins in turbines and stimulate generators to produce electricity. Biomass energy reduces waste that often sits in landfills, giving it another purpose in producing energy. Although it takes a lot more maintenance than other renewable energy sources listed here, the nature of biomass can save money and reduce contaminants in the natural environment. Creating a cleaner environment to help our world is our goal at Golden Arrow. We prioritize the ecosystem with friendly energy solutions, especially replacing harmful energy production sources with renewable, alternative energy methods. Find out about your green packaging "}
