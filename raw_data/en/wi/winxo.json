What should I do if my neck is stiff and hurts to turn? What can I do to help a spasm in lower back? Any of these kinds of pain may be caused by a [herniated disc](https://www.aans.org/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Herniated-Disc), which presses on the spinal nerves. Acupuncture can be an effective treatment for relieving the symptoms of a slipped disc, while also speeding the healing process-all without negative side effects. A [herniated disc](https://www.healthline.com/health/herniated-disk), often referred to as a \"slipped disc,\" or a bulging disc, occurs when damage to one of the shock-absorbing discs of cartilage that sit between the vertebrae creates pressure on the nerves and muscles of the spine. Also called a prolapsed disc, this condition creates inflammation and swelling in a localized area of the spine and can cause severe [pain in the neck](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/neck-pain/), [ lower back pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lower-back-pain-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), sciatica pain, and tingling that radiates down the leg. The vertebral column, or backbone, is made up of vertebrae (individual bones) and intervertebral discs. These discs provide cushioning in between the bones and act as ligaments that hold the bones together. The discs create a shock absorption system that protects the spinal column, and are made up of tough, fibrous outer layers of cartilage, with a gel-like substance on the inside. If there is damage to the tissues of the outer layer, the soft, gel interior can be pushed outwards and breach the outer wall. This can create pressure against the nerves of the spinal column, resulting in symptoms of nerve entrapment: pain, numbness, and/or loss of ability. A herniated disc, also referred to as a \"ruptured disc,\" [most often occurs in the lumbar spine](https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/herniated-disc/lumbar-herniated-disc). A [lumbar herniated disc](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/herniated-disk-in-the-lower-back/) may cause severe lower back pain if it is pressing on a nerve. Pressure on the sciatic nerve area can also cause shooting pain, burning pain, numbness, and/or tingling in one or both legs-a condition commonly referred to as sciatica, also known as lumbar radiculopathy. The sciatic nerve is actually a large bundle of smaller nerves that connects the base of the spine to the top of the leg, travelling through the buttock area. There is a sciatic nerve bundle on each side. About 90% of cases of sciatica are related to herniated discs. [Cervical disc herniation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546618/) refers to a prolapsed disc between one of the seven vertebrae of the cervical spine, or neck area. Compression of the nerves due to a herniated disc in the C2 area can cause headache, or pain in the eye or ear. Herniation of a disc further down the cervical spine happens most commonly in the C5, C6, or C7 area, which can lead to neck pain and/or shoulder pain. Most of the time, sciatic pain or neck pain due to nerve compression in the spine goes away gradually on its own, but it can cause a lot of suffering over the course of several weeks or months before resolving itself. Medical treatment for herniated disc pain typically involves the recommendation of rest and immobilisation and the use of anti-inflammatory medications, muscle relaxers, and pain relievers. However, lack of movement does not really help improve the root cause of the pain, and the use of pain medications or steroids is often accompanied by unwanted side effects. [Acupuncture treatment can significantly reduce acute pain related to sciatica](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5758163/), [neck pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [shoulder pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shoulder-pain-by-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [low back pain](https://myartofwellness.com/tcm-low-back-pain/) due to slipped discs, often providing immediate, short-term relief of severe pain, while helping, long-term, to reduce inflammation and help heal nerve damage. Signs of Herniated Disc When a disc herniates, pain can be sharp and intense. Depending on which disc is affected, there may be neck pain, low back pain, or sciatic pain in the leg, foot, or buttock area. Pain or numbness are caused by the inflammation of the nerve area that is being compressed by the extrusion of the center of the disc. - A [cervical herniated disc](https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/herniated-disc/cervical-herniated-disc-signs-and-symptoms)(in the neck) may cause burning pain in the side of the neck or sharp pain in the back of the neck. Or there may be a more subtle sensation where the neck is tender to the touch. The pain is usually worse when performing vigorous activities or when twisting or turning the head at a certain angle. The overall movement of the neck and head may feel limited and stiff. - Pain may radiate down the arm and cause an \"electric shock-like\" sensation in the hand and fingers. - Weakness in the muscular movement of the shoulder, arm, hand, thumb and fingers may result from the pinching of the nerves of the cervical spine. - A [lumbar herniated disc](https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/herniated-disc/lumbar-herniated-disc-symptoms)(in the lower back) is more likely to cause pain down the leg than in the back. Usually the pain is just on one side of the body. This radiating pain caused by compression of the sciatic nerve can be sharp, burning, and very intense. - Herniation of a lumbar disc can also cause pain in the low back or buttock. This pain may be of the \"throbbing\" type, or feel like a spasm. It may be helped by applying cold or heat to the area. The pain typically is worse after sitting or hunching over for a while, or when bending over from the waist. - The sensation in the buttock, hip, leg and foot may be more like tingling or numbness than searing pain. - \"Foot drop\" is when the nerve compression makes it difficult to fully pick up the foot when walking, so that the toes drag on the floor. The kind of pain caused by a herniated disc can come on quite suddenly and strongly. Fortunately, the pain caused by most herniations of spinal discs resolves in a matter of time without surgery. What Causes Herniated Disc? Slipped discs, or bulging disks, happen most often to people between the ages of 30 and 50. The ruptured disk may happen due to one sudden movement, like lifting something heavy, twisting an awkward way, or even a strong sneeze. But prior to such an event, there was probably some weakness already developing in the outer walls of the disc. Degeneration of the discs can occur over time due to aging. A chronic herniation can develop slowly over years and cause mild symptoms. An acute herniation might happen as the result of some trauma, like an accident, which could create more serious damage to the outer layers of the disc (the annulus fibrosus), allowing the jelly-like material inside (the nucleus pulposus) to extrude, or squeeze out of containment. [Surgery for herniated disc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279471/) is only recommended in rare cases (10-20%), sometimes if the prolapsed disc is affecting the nerves in such a way that bladder or bowel function is negatively impacted. Surgery may also be considered if pain is severe and continues for a long time without getting better. Herniated disc surgery attempts to relieve the nerve compression by removing some of the disc tissue. In cases where there is more extensive degeneration of the spine, a spinal fusion procedure may involve \"fusing\" the vertebrae together with screws while removing the original disc tissue and replacing it with an implant. These types of surgeries for herniated disc may help alleviate pain, but there can still be a long recovery period, and the pain is not guaranteed to go away. Can Acupuncture Help a Herniated Disc? Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been developed over the course of thousands of years to deal with all types of pain conditions. In [the TCM view](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=27817), herniated disc pain is caused by: - Injury to the spine - Invasion of cold, wind, or damp - Liver and/or kidney deficiency In addition to acupuncture treatment, which involves the insertion of very fine needles into specific points along the meridians of the body, we also use treatments such as moxibustion and infrared heat lamps to bring warm energy to parts of the body. TCM treatment for herniated disc will often focus on strengthening the Qi (life force energy) and blood flow to the kidneys, and clearing dampness and bringing warmth to the whole lower back area. [One clinical trial](https://www.nccaom.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Acupuncture%20Herniated%20Disc%20Pain%20Finding.pdf) conducted in a hospital demonstrated that acupuncture treatment combined with the application of moxa warm needle therapy with infrared heat and gentle exercise resulted in reporting of 95% improvement in pain related to lumbar herniated disc. [A recent systematic review](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1136/acupmed-2016-011332) of acupuncture treatment for disc herniation concluded that acupuncture provided better results than pain medications or lumbar traction. [A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1003525719300777) that focused on long-term outcomes for patients with lumbar disc herniation showed that ten years after receiving electric acupuncture treatment for their pain they reported positive long-term results, acupuncture having helped to resolve their sciatica symptoms. Top 5 Tips for How to Heal a Herniated Disc Naturally Most pain due to herniated disc will resolve itself in about six weeks without medical treatment. In the meantime, there are [some things you can do](https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/home-remedies-for-low-back-pain) to help reduce pain and restore freedom of movement. - Seek out treatment from a qualified acupuncturist. A combination of acupuncture, herbal supplementation, tuina massage, moxibustion, and infrared heat therapy will go a long way towards relieving pain and encouraging healing. - Heat and Cold Therapy. Try using a heating pad or hot water bottle to apply gentle heat to the lower back or neck. Alternate with icing the affected area. This helps bring more blood flow to the area, reduces inflammation, and soothes stiffness. - Stay active. It can be tempting to stay in bed when lower back pain and sciatica are causing intense pain or tingling sensations. But immobilisation does not really do anything to help heal nerve pain, and it is actually more beneficial to keep the muscles of the back body strong. Engaging regularly in low-impact activities like walking, biking, or swimming will help keep endorphins flowing and your mood positive better than bed rest will. - Check your sleeping position. Staying in bed can also hurt when you have a slipped disc. Use a pillow to bolster your knees to help relieve tension in the lower back and keep the spine in proper alignment. Use a firm orthopedic pillow to keep the neck aligned. - Nutrition for nerve health. Certain nutrients can be especially beneficial for building and maintaining nerve tissues. Emphasize B-6 and B-12 vitamins, Vitamin E and Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids in your diet and with high quality supplements. Nuts, fish, and good plant-based oils should be consumed regularly. Regular exercise, plenty of sleep, and good nutrition, as always, will go a long way towards helping ensure that a pain condition resolves itself fully and does not return. Acupuncture Near Me for Herniated Disc At Art of Wellness, Dr. Tan and Dr. Cai have over 30 years of experience helping patients with acute and chronic pain due to neurological conditions. Pain due to a herniated disc can be effectively reduced by regular acupuncture treatment, while Chinese herbs and therapeutic massage can help bring healing to the nerves and spine, and help prevent future problems with herniated disc and sciatica. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science.

[ How to Treat Carpal Tunnel Syndrome With Acupuncture & TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-with-acupuncture-tcm/) Do you keep dropping things? It could be carpal tunnel hand pain and weakness caused by a repetitive stress injury. [ Carpal Tunnel Syndrome](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/) is a condition caused by an impingement of the median nerve, which travels through the wrist joint to give sensation to the hand and fingers. When this nerve is compressed, there may be pain or numbness in the fingers and hand. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome often gets worse as time goes on. It is important to seek out treatment for carpal tunnel to help reverse the progression of the problem. Carpal tunnel is the most common form of [peripheral neuropathy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) in the United States, affecting over eight million people per year. Almost a quarter of a million people undergo surgery to try to correct carpal tunnel syndrome annually. Carpal tunnel affects women more often than men, and unfortunately can cause disability, making it difficult or impossible for people to continue their work. [ Acupuncture treatment combined with Chinese herbal remedies has been shown to significantly reduce the tingling pain in fingers and weakness of the hands caused by carpal tunnel syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3523426). Do I have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a type of compression mononeuropathy, in which damage to a single nerve causes pain, numbness, and weakness of a particular part of the body: in this case, the wrist, hand, and fingers. Carpal Tunnel can also cause neck and shoulder pain and various types of headaches. While pain and tingling in the fingers are the most common signs of [carpal tunnel](https://www.sports-health.com/sports-injuries/hand-and-wrist-injuries/my-hand-and-wrist-pain-caused-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-or), it is also true that several other neurological conditions can cause pain and numbness in the hands. Compression of one of the nerves travelling through the cervical spine can also affect the hands. Impingement of the ulnar nerve, which travels down the arm and alongside the elbow (the \"funny bone\"), is known as cubital tunnel syndrome, and can also cause tingling in the fingers. The difference here is that usually carpal tunnel causes the sensations in the thumb, index and middle fingers, while cubital tunnel causes numbness or pain in the ring and pinky fingers. Thoracic outlet syndrome, which causes impingement of nerves between the collarbone and upper ribs, and Reynaud's phenomenon, which causes restriction of blood flow through the blood vessels of the extremities, are rarer conditions which can also cause numbness in the fingers. Top 5 Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel: - Tingling and numbness in the hand and fingers, especially the thumb, index, and ring fingers. May feel like a burning sensation, or occasional short \"shocks\" - Weakness of the hand, tendency to drop objects - Wrist pain, hand pain, and [pain in the forearm](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tennis-elbow-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Fingers feel swollen, even if they don't appear puffy - Tingling that travels up the arm, neck and shoulder pain [Carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Carpal-Tunnel-Syndrome-Fact-sheet) usually begin subtly and develop gradually over time. Often people first notice some tingling or a sense that the fingers are swollen, especially at night. You might feel the urge to \"shake out\" your hands and wrists when you get up. As carpal tunnel becomes more serious, people will start to feel weakness in their hands as they go about their daily activities. In extreme cases, people with carpal tunnel may lose muscle mass in their thumb pad area, or cease to be able to sense hot or cold with their hands, which puts them at risk for burning themselves. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Migraines [Recent research](https://headaches.org/2015/05/04/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-associated-with-migraine/) has suggested that there may be a [link between carpal tunnel and migraine headaches](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387155/). A study found that people with carpal tunnel were two times as likely to also suffer from migraines, and that people with migraines were twice as likely to also have symptoms of carpal tunnel. This information may help medical professionals learn more about migraine, which remains a mysterious condition, and has not been traditionally viewed as a problem with nerve compression. While conventional medicine still has limited understanding of [migraine, acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) is an effective modality for [headache relief](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). A TCM practitioner can help headache, wrist pain, hand pain, [neck](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [shoulder pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shoulder-pain-by-acupuncture-and-tcm/), all simultaneously, without any negative side effects. Carpal Tunnel Causes and Treatment for Carpal Tunnel Repetitive movements that cause inflammation in the wrist joint are the primary causes of carpal tunnel syndrome. This kind of repetitive stress injury occurs when you perform the same motions with the wrist and hand over and over, as when working with tools or assembly, chopping with a knife, playing an instrument, or typing on a keyboard. When you seek treatment for carpal tunnel, diagnostic testing will first be done to determine exactly what bones, nerves, muscles, or tendons might be causing symptoms of pain and tingling. [Diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can also be a cause of mononeuropathies like carpal tunnel. The first treatment for carpal tunnel usually involves some immobilization of the wrist (with a wrist splint or brace) and anti-inflammatory medications or injections. If the condition does not improve after reduction and modification of the repetitive motions that were causing carpal tunnel symptoms, then a specialist may recommend surgery. Electroscopic procedures may make small incisions in the tendon of the wrist to relieve pressure on the median nerve. Early treatment of carpal tunnel is crucial for preventing further damage to the median nerve. Addressing symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome as soon as possible with alternative modalities such as acupuncture and therapeutic tui na massage can help restore full function of the nerves and the mobility and strength of the hands and fingers. How Acupuncture Helps Carpal Tunnel Traditional Chinese Medicine uses a combination of therapies to address conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome. Acupuncture treatment works on the principle that pain and loss of mobility in the body is often due to blocked energy (Qi) along the meridians (energy pathways) of the body. Acupuncture treatment combined with herbal supplementation can [reduce inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1781596/) and help with the [regeneration of nerve](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0192415X01000393) and other tissues. According to TCM theory, carpal tunnel syndrome is usually attributed to \"wind\" or cold invading the muscles and ligaments, along with Qi and/or blood stasis causing blockages. [One study](https://www.nccaom.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Acupuncture%20Stops%20Carpal%20Tunnel%20Wrist%20Pain,%20Restores%20Dexterity.pdf) showed that acupuncture treatment combined with a topical herbal treatment reduced pain in 90% and improved wrist function in 85% of the participants. [Another study](https://time.com/4690200/acupuncture-carpal-tunnel-syndrome/) in an American hospital, aimed at proving scientifically the unknown ways in which acupuncture works, used electrodes to show how treatment affected nerve impulses and produced changes in the somatosensory cortex. This study objectively quantified that acupuncture improved the conductivity of nerves in the wrist and effected changes in the brain deemed related to their carpal tunnel syndrome. Top 5 Tips for Carpal Tunnel Relief Here are some carpal tunnel exercises and acupressure points for carpal tunnel that you can practice to help prevent carpal tunnel and relieve carpal tunnel symptoms. - Your doctor may recommend nerve gliding exercises, sometimes called nerve flossing or neural gliding. These gentle exercises are designed to help facilitate the smooth movement of the tendon through the carpal tunnel of the wrist bones, so as to alleviate pressure and inflammation of the median nerve. - Using acupressure points for carpal tunnel can help relieve symptoms. Try applying firm pressure to PC6 Nei Guan, located on the inner arm, three finger-widths below the wrist. - Be especially mindful when you are performing repetitive tasks with your hands. Take frequent breaks to stretch and rub your wrists. - Pay attention to your sleep position. Avoid putting pressure on your wrists or holding them in a bent position during the night. Elevate your hands and wrists if possible. - Keep your hands and wrists warm. Wear gloves whenever appropriate to the temperature in your environment. Keep a cup of hot tea nearby while you work, to warm your hands. Acupuncture Near Me for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Carpal Tunnel tends to worsen over time as we age and continue to engage in repetitive movements through our daily activities. If you or someone you know is experiencing tingling in the fingers, hand pain, or wrist pain-or even having migraine headaches or neck and shoulder pain that may seem unrelated-it is important to address it promptly. Integrative care combining conventional medicine and acupuncture treatment for carpal tunnel can help to reduce hand pain, numbness in the fingers, and weakness in the wrist.

[ How to Treat Ringing in the Ears With Acupuncture ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/) By Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. How do I stop ringing in my ears? Why do I have ringing in one ear sometimes, ringing in the left ear or ringing in the right ear? Constant ringing in ears can impact the ability to work, sleep, and live life normally. The fear that you may be going deaf or never be able to shake that humming in ears can even cause depression. Can acupuncture help ringing in the ears? The good news is: yes, it can! We've all experienced that annoying buzzing in ear and temporary hear loss at some point, probably after a loud music concert or working with power tools. But ringing in the ears, also known as tinnitus, that persists long term may be a sign of other health problems. What is [ tinnitus](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-and-what-to-do-about-it)? When you seek advice from your doctor, he/she will explain it in detail. [Tinnitus](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tinnitus/symptoms-causes/syc-20350156) is the medical term for the perception of a buzzing sound or ringing in the ears, which might be intermittent or persistent. The sense of humming in the ears or ringing in one ear is common; roughly a third of the population has experienced it at some point in their lives. Acupuncture can be an effective treatment for reducing the volume and insistence of tinnitus symptoms. Constant ringing in the ears is not really considered a medical condition in and of itself; [tinnitus](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/tinnitus) is caused by other underlying problems. Hear loss and the perception of sounds that other people can't hear, sometimes more like a clicking or hissing, may be due to some malfunction of the auditory nerve that connects the inner ear to the parts of the brain that perceive sounds. Tinnitus is correlated with chronic [ stress](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/stress/). Many military veterans suffer from tinnitus due to the frequent very loud, explosive noises they are exposed to during training and combat. Depending on the severity, ringing in the ears can seriously impact a person's ability to function. Is tinnitus curable? Modern medical science does not have a definitive solution. It may be worthwhile to seek out alternative methods to treat ringing in right ear or ringing in left ear. Acupuncture treatment can help ringing in the ears to fade. Top 10 Causes of Ringing in the Ears Most people who suffer from high pitched ringing in ears have experienced some damage to the cochlea, the sensitive cells of the inner ear, because of loud sounds. When a person is exposed to very loud noises over a long period of time, permanent damage to the inner ear can occur. But ringing in ears causes can include several other medical conditions. The main [tinnitus causes](https://www.ata.org/understanding-facts/causes) are: - Prolonged exposure to loud noises - Head or neck injuries, such as whiplash - TMJ that irritates the auditory nerve - Circulatory problems like [high blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/)or cardiovascular disease [Meniere's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)(a syndrome marked by tinnitus, [vertigo](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), deafness, and a sensation of the ears being clogged) - Age-induced hearing loss (deaf) - Infection in the ear - Overproduction of earwax - Foreign object obstructing the ear canal - Congestion of the head and nose due to cold, flu or sinus infection Certain [ medications can cause ototoxicity](https://www.americanear.com/your-hearing/ototoxic-medicines-list), which damages the sensitive cochlea of the inner ear. Ototox damage can be caused by chemotherapy or by some antibiotics. Loss of balance and the ability to hear sounds with high frequencies are other signs of [ototoxicity](http://hearing.wustl.edu/Hearing-Education-Center/Disease-Diagnosis-Treatment/Ototoxicity). Complications of [shingles, or herpes zoster infection](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shingles-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), can also cause tinnitus and hearing loss. Conventional Tinnitus Remedies Currently there is no medical tinnitus cure. Mild cases of ringing in the ears due to head congestion or a brief exposure to loud noises will likely resolve themselves in time. Tinnitus caused by something blocking the ear canal, such as excess earwax, buildup of dirt or hair, a small object or even simple head congestion can be cleared up by removing the blockage. If the symptom of ringing in the ears is determined to be caused by a mechanical problem (like TMJ), trauma, or injury, then that must be healed in order to resolve the tinnitus. Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) specialists may treat tinnitus with vasodilator drugs, which dilate the blood vessels in the ear in the hopes that increased blood flow will help heal damaged cells. Unfortunately, these [medications for tinnitus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136369/) can have some negative side effects, including heart palpitations, headaches, lethargy and anxiety in some patients. Injections or intravenous application of lidocaine to the inner ear has been used as a remedy, but this treatment has also caused side effects such as vertigo and nausea, and in some patients, it worsened their tinnitus. [ Lidocaine](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/019459988309100514?journalCode=otoj) itself may cause ototoxicity, and therefore increase the chances of hearing loss. People with a persistent problem of both hearing loss and ringing in right ear are often recommended hearing aids, which help to increase the volume of external sounds, so that the perception of internal noises is reduced. In other cases, people may use electronic sound-masking devices that create ambient \"white noise\" to help cancel out the sound of humming or ringing in left ear. Sometimes people are referred to a therapist for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps people learn to cope with the condition. Tinnitus retaining therapy (TRT) is specifically designed to help people learn to ignore the constant background noise through habituation. Often people are prescribed psychiatric medications for depression and anxiety to help them sleep better and feel less distressed by the sensation of constant ringing in ears. Ringing in the ears that persists over time can and should be addressed with alternative therapies if these methods are not improving a person's quality of life. Does Acupuncture Help Ringing in the Ears? Tinnitus is believed to be [ related to the somatosensory nervous system](https://www.actcm.edu/blog/acupuncture-may-be-effective-treatment-for-tinnitus/), which gathers signals from the sensory organs of the head and face and communicates them to the brain. When neck or head trauma, circulatory problems, nerve damage, [dental work](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or other events cause damage to the auditory nerves or the cochlea of the inner ear, signals can begin to misfire. Hyperactive firing of the auditory nerves can lead to the \"phantom sounds\" of tinnitus. According to TCM theory, problems such as tinnitus are caused by imbalances of the energies of the body. Sometimes there is excessive energy or heat arising in one organ system, and/or a deficiency of energy or blood flow in other organ systems. In TCM, we would usually consider ringing in the ears to be related to one of the following differentiations: - Excessive, rising liver heat - Excessive liver and gallbladder heat - Phlegm-fire stagnation - Kidney essence deficiency - Blood-Qi deficiency Often patients demonstrate a combination of two or more of these excesses and/or deficiencies. Excessive conditions tend to show irritability, headaches, and dizziness. The ringing in the ears is loud, and comes on suddenly. With deficient conditions, the onset of the noise is low, more like a whooshing or humming that comes and goes, and may be accompanied by poor memory and focus. After listening carefully to learn exactly how the patient's symptoms are presenting, an acupuncture practitioner will use a specific combination of acupoints at each session to dispel blockages and bring the energies into harmony. Acupuncture treatment works on tinnitus by improving blood flow to the affected areas, helping to promote regeneration of nerve tissues, [calming anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [reducing the effects of chronic stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), and [ improving sleep](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). TCM uses herbal formulae to support the work of the acupuncture treatment. For tinnitus, the TCM practitioner will choose herbs to help boost circulation of blood and Qi, clear heat in the liver, strengthen the kidneys, and calm the mind. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771359/) showed that patients receiving acupuncture treatments reported a significant reduction in the severity and loudness of ringing in the ears when compared with patients being given a placebo treatment. [Another study](https://www.nccaom.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Acupuncture%20and%20Herbs%20Quiet%20Tinnitus.pdf) at a hospital in China showed that treatment led to a marked improvement of overall hearing capability, reduced loud ringing in ears, and reduced depression. Tinnitus that is caused by mechanical problems such as TMJ or a [whiplash injury to the neck](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can also be helped by acupuncture treatment by focusing on reducing inflammation and pain in those areas that are impacting the auditory nerves. Top 3 Tips for Self Care of Ringing in the Ears If you are suffering from tinnitus or mild deafness, it is important to make some lifestyle modifications so that you can get past the sensation of humming in ears. - Cut out caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco. It is well known that these chemicals contribute to tinnitus. - Protect your hearing. When going to a loud concert or using power tools, wear ear plugs. - Reduce stress and make rest a priority. Chronic stress leads to many health problems, and ringing in the ears is another sign that you may need to focus more on exercise, meditation, mindfulness, and quality time devoted to relaxing the mind and body. Acupuncture Near Me for Ringing in the Ears If you or someone you know is suffering from constant ringing in the ears, please see your doctor to have your hearing checked, as well as screening for any cardiovascular, thyroid, or other potential problems impacting your hearing. If conventional treatments do not bring relief of tinnitus symptoms, then we encourage you to call us at Art of Wellness and try an alternative approach to tinnitus remedies. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Panic Attacks With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By [A panic attack](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/panic-disorder-when-fear-overwhelms/index.shtml) is a sudden, overwhelming sense of fear that causes an intense emotional and physical response, often including trouble breathing, heart or chest pain, sweating, and dizziness. One way to get help for panic attacks and relieve the effects of [long-term stress is with acupuncture and TCM](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). Anyone might have one or two panic attacks in their lifetime. When a person has attacks frequently, they may be [diagnosed with panic disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20376027). Most typically, this disorder arises when a person is in early adulthood, but panic attacks can also occur in children and adolescents. For people who experience panic attacks, quality of life can be greatly reduced, as the haunting worry that another episode may come on unexpectedly at any time may cause them to begin limiting their activities. In some cases, panic disorder with agoraphobia, a psychological condition in which a person is so afraid of entering into situations where they feel unsafe that they begin to avoid going out, go hand in hand together. Panic attacks are also often related to anxiety, [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/depression/), and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. When a person seeks out medical care, [ panic attack treatment](https://www.anxiety.org/10-tips-treating-panic-disorder) usually involves a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and prescription psychiatric medications like antidepressants (zoloft for panic attack) or tranquilizers. This combination of therapy may help reduce the frequency and severity of panic attacks, but these types of drugs can come with side effects and start a dependency. [TCM and acupuncture offer natural remedies for panic attack](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Blog/723-panicattacksshenmen#:~:text=Acupuncture%20for%20the%20treatment%20of,and%20duration%20of%20panic%20attacks.) that work quickly; many patients begin to feel better after their very first treatment. Top 10 Signs of a Panic Attack A panic attack comes on suddenly, instilling an intense feeling of dread that typically peaks within ten minutes, then begins to dissipate. A panic attack is medically defined as involving at least four of these [symptoms](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/panic-disorder-agoraphobia/symptoms): - Accelerated heart rate, palpitations, sensation of heart pounding or racing [Trembling, shaking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-essential-tremor-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Sweating, hot flush, or chills - Feeling that you [can't catch your breath](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-asthma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or are choking - Chest pain or tightness - Nausea, upset stomach - Feeling faint, dizzy, light-headed - Numbness or tingling (paresthesia) - Feeling detached - Fear of losing control or dying The symptoms associated with panic attack are very scary and similar to other, potentially life-threatening conditions, such as a heart attack or an [asthma attack](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-asthma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). People with panic disorder often feel they must organize their lives around the fear of having another attack. Some people may repeatedly seek out emergency care when in the throes of an attack because they are very seriously afraid that they may be dying. Panic Attack Causes The exact cause of panic attacks is not completely understood by medical science. In some instances, panic attacks are brought on by specific psychological triggers, such as having to take a test, flying, or being in a crowded or tight space. Some people experience a panic attack while driving. But many people have panic attacks for [no apparent reason](https://www.psycom.net/when-panic-attacks-how-to-stop), sometimes even being awakened from sleep with a racing heartbeat (nocturnal panic attack or panic attack in the middle of the night). It is believed that some people are more prone to extreme stress responses, and this condition does seem to run in families, so genetics may play a role. The physical signs of stress and anxiety are the body's way of reacting to danger. The sympathetic nervous system causes the adrenal glands to produce hormones that stimulate that \"fight or flight\" feeling of energy. When a person has gone through a prolonged period of chronic stress, or experienced a trauma, the system can become unbalanced, and he or she may feel an extreme version of this chemical response flooding the body, even though there is no immediate danger. How Is Panic Disorder Different From [Anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/anxiety/)? Panic disorder is considered to be a type of anxiety disorder, but it is differentiated from Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Panic attacks are similar to anxiety in the sense that both can cause emotional feelings of fear and dread and physical sensations of a fast heartbeat and difficulty breathing. They are both health conditions related to the long term mental and physical effects of stress. The difference is that a panic attack is more extreme in its intensity and lasts for a short period of time, whereas anxiety is a pervasive, uncomfortable feeling that goes on and on. Panic Attacks During Pregnancy Pregnancy is an emotional time, and most women have some feelings of worry. However, some women experience more serious anxiety and panic attack while pregnant. These feelings should definitely be addressed, as documented studies have shown that women who suffered panic attacks during pregnancy were more likely to experience [preterm birth and/or deliver an infant who is small](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19428119/) for their gestational age. Panic episodes may also manifest during the [postpartum period](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16529913/), especially among women who have just given birth to their first child. This may be at least partially due to the sudden fluctuation of hormones that occurs after birth. Acupuncture and natural herbs for anxiety and panic attack offer an effective way of dealing with panic attacks during pregnancy and after. How to Stop Panic Attacks With Acupuncture The idea of a mind-body connection is still rather new in western medical thought, but the belief that the physical, emotional, and spiritual are all inextricably intertwined has been part of Traditional Chinese Medicine theory for thousands of years. According to TCM, emotional energy can build up in the body; if it isn't released, it can cause imbalances. Fear causes Qi, the life force energy that flows through the body, to move downwards; this is what causes sensations of light-headedness and disorientation. Fear is related to the kidneys, which are involved in the release of adrenaline and cortisol in response to stressors. Anger and frustration are related to the liver, grief is related to the lungs, and worry is related to the spleen. After a thorough consultation to understand the nature of an individual's panic attack patterns, an acupuncture practitioner may choose points to work upon the appropriate organ systems to encourage the smooth flow of Qi. [Acupuncture treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4104565/) has been shown to help [balance levels of cortisol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6825666/) and [serotonin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16565594/), which will help even out the emotional state and regulate the body's stress responses. Herbal supplements and nutrition are key components of comprehensive TCM management of panic attack. Your acupuncturist will likely formulate a specific combination of [herbs that will help support the kidneys and other organs](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=28023), as well as giving directions as to what foods will be most and least beneficial to help resolve the chronic effects of stress underlying the panic disorder. Top 5 Tips for Calming Down From a Panic Attack The best help for panic attacks is to focus on breathing. Disciplines that help you learn how to control breathing and be present in the moment, such as meditation, Tai Qi, and yoga, are excellent for helping to prevent a panic attack trigger from leading to a panic attack severe enough to disrupt your life. - Practice breathing: find a type of breathwork that you find inspiring. It might be a simple meditation app that you use before bed at night, or it might be a challenging yoga practice that takes you outside of your comfort zone. It can be therapeutic to learn to breathe through discomfort so that when you are triggered, you can be more adapted to coping with a panic attack. - Acupressure: stimulating specific [acupressure points on the body can help relieve stress](https://myartofwellness.com/3-acupoints-for-anxiety/)and dissipate panicky feelings. One good point to try for acupressure for panic attack is L-3, sometimes called the \"Great Surge,\" which refers to big rushes of energy that move up through the body when we feel stressed. This point is located on the top of the foot, between the tendons of the big and second toes, about an inch up from the base of the toes. Pressing deeply into this area and rubbing helps to control feelings of anxiety. This point is useful for times when you are in the middle of something (maybe a Zoom meeting?), as you can use the toe or heel of one foot to press the L-3 point on the other foot. - Eat foods high in B vitamins: B vitamins support the nervous system, so it's important to emphasize them in your diet. Foods high in B vitamins include: leafy greens, beans, turkey, salmon, eggs, and nutritional yeast. - Avoid sugar, coffee, and alcohol. These substances create excess heat in the body, which can contribute to feelings of anger and frustration. Alcohol and panic attacks, and caffeine panic attack can be helped by drinking more water and herbal teas instead. - Self-talk: Many people with anxiety, depression, or panic disorder are stuck in a loop of thinking negative thoughts. When a panic attack strikes, a person start thinking, \"this is a disaster,\" or \"I'm dying.\" Practice telling yourself what to say for preventing a panic attack, such as \"this is just anxiety,\" or \"this will be over soon.\" Look for something near you to focus on instead, and ground yourself by naming it. There may be no simple panic attack cure, but with acupuncture treatment and herbs, good nutrition, exercise, and positive affirmation, it is certainly possible to reduce the frequency and severity of panic attacks.

[ How To Prevent Miscarriage With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-prevent-miscarriage-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. [Miscarriage](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pregnancy-loss-miscarriage/symptoms-causes/syc-20354298) is the spontaneous loss of pregnancy. While it is not talked about much, it is very common; 10-20% of pregnancies end in early miscarriage. TCM and acupuncture methods, well-known for helping women with [infertility](https://myartofwellness.com/fertility-treatment-plans/) issues, can be used successfully to [prevent threatened miscarriage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3933529/). Sometimes called spontaneous abortion, miscarriage at 12 weeks or earlier is often due to chromosomal abnormalities in the developing fetus. In some cases, miscarriage or recurrent miscarriages are caused by the mother's health condition. While miscarriage is common, and very early miscarriage, sometimes called chemical pregnancy, may even go unnoticed, women who have experienced this should seek out care. The spontaneous ending of pregnancy is emotionally difficult no matter the circumstances, and hormone imbalances can cause other problems if left unaddressed. Acupuncture treatment and TCM herbal supplements can help support a full recovery and lay a healthy foundation for [getting pregnant](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) after miscarriage. Signs and Symptoms of [Miscarriage](https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/miscarriage-a-to-z) While some bleeding in the first trimester is common (about 20% of women experience this), it can be an indication that the pregnancy is at risk. Other [signs of miscarriage](https://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-complications/signs-of-miscarriage-916) include: - Vaginal bleeding that is brownish or bright red - Discharge that include clots - Cramping or pain in the abdomen or lower back area, similar to menstrual cramps - Contractions in the uterus that occur every 5-20 minutes, similar to labor pains - Decrease in other early pregnancy symptoms, such as nausea and breast tenderness In some cases, a miscarriage occurs without any signs of cramping or bleeding at all. Sometimes referred to as a [missed miscarriage](https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/complications/miscarriage/what-is-a-missed-miscarriage/), missed abortion, or silent miscarriage, in this situation, a woman may not discover that she has miscarried until a doctor finds that there is no fetal heartbeat and checks via ultrasound and/or testing for HCG (pregnancy hormone) levels. What Causes Miscarriage? A positive pregnancy test usually can't confirm a pregnancy until the third or fourth week, once implantation has occurred. It is [estimated](https://www.verywellfamily.com/making-sense-of-miscarriage-statistics-2371721) that miscarriage at 4 weeks or earlier, or when a fertilized egg has not successfully implanted, happens in up to 70% of conceptions. Miscarriage at 6 weeks or later is much less common; only about 5% of pregnancies end once this time when the heartbeat can be detected has passed. Maternal age is one risk factor (20% of women over 35 might miscarry, while as many as 80% of pregnant women over 45 might miscarry). Chromosomal abnormalities in an embryo are more likely when a woman is older. The other most common reasons for a miscarriage to occur include: - Hormonal imbalances - due to PCOS, low progesterone, diabetes, thyroid condition, etc. - Thin or nutrient-poor endometrial lining - Autoimmune issues - Structural issues of the cervix or uterus, polyps, fibroid - Exposure to toxins - S [moking,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)alcohol, use of drugs One of the primary reasons that a woman might miscarry during the second trimester is cervical insufficiency. In this case, there may be no prior symptoms, but the miscarriage begins with pressure or the water breaking. Once this weakness of the cervix has been discovered, doctors can treat this condition and protect subsequent pregnancies by making a \"circling\" stitch in the cervix at around the 12th week. Recovering from a Miscarriage The extent to which a woman may need [medical intervention](https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/after-miscarriage/) during miscarriage varies, depending on how advanced the pregnancy. If the pregnancy was still in the very early stages, and there is heavy bleeding, then the uterus may empty itself. However, if things have progressed further into the first trimester, and miscarriage at 12 weeks or thereabouts occurs, a woman may need medical attention to help expel all of the tissues from the uterus. This may be accomplished with medication (misoprostol, sometimes combined with mifepristone), taken orally or as a suppository, which will cause more cramping and the expulsion of the fetal and placental tissues. In other cases, it may be necessary for a doctor to perform a D & C (dilation and curettage), in which the tissues are surgically removed from the uterus. Conventional medical treatment for miscarriage unfortunately does not offer much in the way of healing. The hormonal and emotional effects of a miscarriage can be profoundly upsetting. Feelings of grief, disappointment, and loss are very real, and if unresolved, can affect a woman's mental and physical health going forward. Your acupuncture practitioner can provide holistic alternative care to help you recover from miscarriage. A program of acupuncture treatments, herbs, and caring support will focus on reestablishing a good flow of Qi and blood to the reproductive system while alleviating stress and anxiety. Balancing the hormones and emotions allows for the menstrual cycle to return to normal, and strengthens the organ systems so that subsequent pregnancy will start from a place of peak heath. Can Acupuncture Help Prevent Miscarriage? According to TCM theory, the vital energies-Jing (or essence), Qi (life force energy), Yin (female/cool energy) and Yang (male/warm energy)-must be balanced for optimal health, and this is especially true when a woman is preparing to bring a new life into the world. The quality of eggs and sperm depend on it. Naturally, as a woman ages, there will be some depletion of these energies, and this can be exacerbated by lifestyle habits: [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), overwork, diet, [lack of sleep](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), etc. Overall, TCM recognizes 4 differentiations of conditions that can lead to [miscarriage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3689170/): - Kidney deficiency - Women with this type of deficiency may have experienced a late menarche (delayed first period), irregular cycles, anovulatory cycles (don't always ovulate), long cycles. A woman might have been born with a kidney deficiency or it can develop due to exhaustion, heavy labor, or excessive sexual behaviors. - Blood or Qi deficiency - This condition is related to the digestive system, when the stomach and/or spleen are not bringing enough nutrients to support and nourish the embryo. - Excess Heat - If internal fire is too strong, it causes bleeding. This can cause the placenta to become detached and uterine contractions to begin, causing miscarriage. - Injury - a fall or accident or excessive sexual activity during pregnancy can irritate the uterus, causing contractions. Other causes could include: medications, antibiotics, food poisoning, or exposure to environmental toxins. Based on the presenting symptoms, an acupuncturist will determine which differentiation and create a treatment plan to address root causes. We can help to prevent miscarriage when there is spotting or cramping by calming the uterus to stop contractions and bleeding. Bed rest may be recommended, involving no exercise, no sexual activity, and no heavy labor. The most effective preventive treatment happens pre-pregnancy. If a woman has one or two miscarriages or even three or more (habitual miscarriage), it is important that we take action to prevent problems before conception. Three months of treatment will prepare the body well to insure a full-term pregnancy. Ideally, a woman who is ready to get pregnant would seek acupuncture treatment and herbs to help strengthen all aspects of the reproductive systems for at least a few cycles before conceiving. Acupuncture treatment can help [prevent miscarriage](https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-016-1092-8) by: - Balancing hormones - Treating PCOS - Improving the quality of endometrial lining - Calming contractions early in the pregnancy - Improving blood flow and preventing clotting - Regulating immune responses - Reducing stress and anxiety Top 5 Tips to Prevent Miscarriage Self care is always important, but during pregnancy, it is especially vital to prioritize your health and wellness. The need to eat and rest appropriately cannot be overemphasized during this crucial time. - Eat cooling foods - During pregnancy, women carry more heat in the body and often feel hot. It is best not to have anything too spicy; spicy food can encourage bleeding and trigger contractions. Cooling foods include: cucumbers, melons, citrus fruits, celery, leafy greens, soy and mung beans, eggs, millet, buckwheat, whole wheat. - Avoid warming foods - Warming foods raise yang energy and body temperature. Be moderated from: deep fried food, coconut, leeks, onions, roasted walnuts, pistachios and pine nuts, and spices like cinnamon, cloves, pepper, ginger, garlic, mustard, chili pepper, or add more cooling food if there is warming food. - Stay away from alcohol and coffee. Try chrysanthemum tea or peppermint tea as an alternative. - Make sure you are getting the right balance of calcium and magnesium. Most people get more calcium than magnesium. Foods high in magnesium include spinach, beans, brown rice, and fish like halibut and salmon. - If you experience bleeding or cramping, cease all activities, including manual labor, exercise and sex.
