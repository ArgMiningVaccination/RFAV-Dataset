Merback And so that you might see yourself there and gently look at it, this pious mirror for your own good we bring before your eyes,in visible form, with characters. \u2014Arnoul Gr /C19eban, Le myst /C18ere de la Passion (mid-1400s) 1 In Christianity's preeminent narrative image, the Crucix- ion, Jesus of Nazareth hangs dead on the Cross, there for all to see. Ridiculed as the King of the Jews, victim of the most abhorrent of punishments, focal point of mystery and won- der, he embodies in death a harrowing paradox. For at theclimax of the Passion drama, the epochal moment towardwhich the Gospels point again and again, Jesus's messianicidentity was still hanging in the balance. Miracles had testi-ed to his nature as a \"divine man [u eo&nr,theios an ^er],\" and his own christological utterances had led many to pon-der the peculiar nature of his identity. 2Some of those pres- ent on Golgotha watched and waited for divine power tobecome manifest in events, and passersby scoffed out loud atthe claims made about him, challenging him to come downfrom the Cross. While family and friends mourned, soldiersgambled for his clothes; others simply mocked him (Mark15:24-32). Measured by the diverse responses among the crowd on Golgotha, both those recorded in the Gospels and those imagined for centuries, the spectacle of Christ crucied counts as a radically bewildering event\u2014\"unto the Jews astumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness,\" as Paulwrote in 1 Corinthians (1:23). Unlike its predecessor inpagan tragedy, it is a spectacle of suffering and death thatbrings to the fore the experience of incoherence. This inco-herence, spinning out from the half-disclosed reality ofJesus's divine nature, exists both for the characters inside the Gospel text, those present on Golgotha as witnesses, and for participants outside, the Passion story's readers and listeners,for whom the role of \"witness\" must always be constitutedthrough an act of recollection or remembering . Each and every participant in the story must nd his or her own path towardcoherence; each one must, in a very fundamental way, put itall together, make sense of what has happened\u2014the coreimaginative demand that all narratives place on their readers. For believers past and present, entering personally into the Crucixion image, there to recollect not only its terrors andsufferings but also the claims and counterclaims made aboutJesus's identity, has therefore meant standing at an existen-tial crossroads, a place where opposing trajectories, bothobjective and subjective, meet and collide. 3Confronted by the image of Jesus crucied, Christian conscience faces ademand that precedes the fundamental impulse toward imi- tation (imitatio Christi) and the desire for conversion andunion: the comprehension of a paradox uniting identity and presence that, in itself, constitutes an ever-renewing chal- lenge to faith\u2014an \"enduring predicament\" brought about by grace itself. 4 From the mid-thirteenth century on, European artists pro- jected this demand onto their depictions of protagonists andantagonists, models and antimodels, within the narrative Pas-sion image for the discernment of those outside it. Figureswho had once been mere agents, embodiments of a narrativefunction, would henceforth be fleshed out as characters, embodied moral types possessed of human idiosyncrasies and passions, capable of a full range of situated responses\u2014from belief to incredulity, from faith to doubt, from compas-sion to cruelty\u2014indicative of human will. Especially strikingin this regard, as we will see, is the interest altar paintersbegin to show in the gure of the witness ,developing in the process three general, though not always distinguishable,character types: 1) those who see the reality of divinity through the twin veils of Incarnation and human death, recog- nizing Jesus as the Christ of prophecy and the Son of Man; 2) those who, trapped in a mere \"carnal seeing,\" remain blind to that divinity, failing to recognize Jesus as Christ; and 3) those who appear suspended, as it were, between acceptance andrejection of Jesus's messianic identity, hovering at the thresh-old between blindness and seeing, between refusing and wel-coming truth's disclosure. By the middle of the fteenth century, masters at the fore- front of religious realism in northern Europe, for example,Dieric Bouts of Haarlem, in his Descent from the Cross triptych in Granada, had made it de rigueur to endow certain witnesscharacters, even in complex multigured compositions, withminutely described signs of awareness and interiority(Fig. 1). 5Such faces, captured in what appears to be the dawning of comprehension, could become galvanizing points of interest and subjective identication for beholders, even, or especially, if they have stepped into the scene of wit-nessing as unbelievers. Watching this form of watching, weare imbricated in narrative; we place ourselves, as Karl Morri-son has put it, \"into the position of looking over the shoul-ders of the people to whom the events happened as they puttogether what had happened to them.\" 6What may rightly be counted as a normative condition of all visual narrative\u2014the beholder's \"putting together\" of what has or had here intensied by the beholder's need to takethe measure of his or her own response before the terrifyingspectacle of suffering that sin has brought about, and his orher own worthiness to receive the gifts of that sacrice, tond coherence in the experience of inner transformation and conversion to God. In this sense each and every Crucixionimage poses a challenge to the Christian beholder, one that is ever-renewing and also ever-haunted by failure. Conversioncan never be a fait accompli, discipleship never perfected, not when their highest criterion is inner transformation.7 Any phenomenology of spiritual seeing we might wish toreconstitute with the help of the Crucixion must, I suggest,take account of both the probationary nature of conversionand the aspirational nature of its most powerful narrativesign: recognition (a term whose specic meaning will be unpacked shortly). Rather than focusing on positive examples of conversion, such as Bouts's sensitively drawn witness to the Crucixion, aphenomenology of recognition will be developed here withthe help of an antimodel: a witness gure who embodies\"spiritual blindness\" and thematizes the failure to overcomeit, in a characterization both outwardly derogatory and inher-ently reflexive. The gure in question was conjured up byHans Burgkmair the Elder (1473-1531) in a Crucixion scene painted for the Dominican nuns of St. Katherine's in Augsburg (Fig. 2), the city where the artist was born, wherehis father, Thoman (1444-1523), trained him, and where heran his own workshop as a member of the guild of painters,glaziers, and carvers from 1498 on. 8Striding in from stage left onto the Golgotha Burgkmair composed for the con-vent's chapter house (part of a series of six so-called Basilika- bilder, to be discussed below), the strange gure\u2014turbaned, partly armored, dressed in robes of Levantine patterning,and shown in prole\u2014diverts the attention of the Good Cen-turion and another military ofcer. A cross re of contemp-tuous glares isolates him against the painting's right edge,and a dispute of some sort seems to be under way (Fig. 3).But it is not simply the adversarial role he is poised to playthat attracts the ire of those who encounter him; his veryappearance is antagonistic. From the dark countenance and greasy hair that mats his face to the beady, bloodshot eyes, cracked teeth, bulbous lips, and, above all, long, hookednose, this strange foreigner could hardly be mistaken for any-one, or anything, other than what Burgkmair paints him tobe: a monstrously ugly Jew. What is more unsettling, the artisthas depicted the creature confronted by his own mirrorreflection, glaring out at him from the centurion's polishedepauliere. The dark-faced Jewish soldier, however, does not see it; rather, it \"sees\" him\u2014it recognizes him\u2014and registers what it sees with an unmistakable look of horror (Fig. 4). Completed by Burgkmair in 1504, the large, arched com- position with the Crucixion at its center was the fourth in a series of so-called Basilikabilder, painted \"portraits\" of the seven basilican churches of Rome (the Sette Chiese), commis-sioned by the Dominican nuns of Augsburg's Katharinenklos-ter (Fig. 24). 9It was Hans Holbein the Elder who, in 1499, executed the inaugural panel, devoted to S. Maria Maggiore;the second, third, and fourth panels, San Pietro, San Giovanni Laterano ,a n dSanta Croce respectively ,were done by Burgk- mair and his shop; an unknown Master L.F. brought togetherimagery relating to S. Lorenzo and S. Sebastiano into a singlepanel in 1502; and nally, in 1504, a sixth commission repre-senting S. Paolo fuori le mura was executed by Holbein in acommand performance. Arrayed around the chapter house of the Katharinenkloster and shaped to t its vaulted bays, the series has long been associated with a papal indulgencegranted to the nuns by Pope Innocent VIII (1484-92), per-mitting them to earn a remission of sins equivalent to thosegranted pilgrims visiting the Sette Chiese. Numerous scholars have inferred from this that the Basilikabilder functioned within a regimen of \"virtual pilgrimage\" for the recluses, but it must be admitted that the evidence takes us only so far inthis direction. For reasons that will later become clear, I sub-scribe to a soft version of this thesis, one that sees the Basilika- bilder as multifunctional images, geared to the penitential, commemorative, and political dimensions of the nuns' aspira-tions for self-regeneration and consolidation. How should we approach this bizarre catoptric motif and its embeddedness in a major cycle of paintings made for aprestigious monastic institution\u2014a multiyear project thatultimately brought together three leading Augsburg paintersand ve successive abbess-patrons, each from a wealthy patri-cian family with its own stakes in the cloister's tradition ofprominence? At rst sight, Burgkmair's dark-faced characteris merely an inventive bit of Passion staffage with a noxious ethnographic (or patently anti-Semitic) twist, thus not far from the routine of countless late medieval and Renaissancepainters. He appears onstage as something of a nobody: bothsoldier and passerby, the gure is not grouped among 1Dieric Bouts, witnessing soldier, detail from Crucixion , left wing of Descent from the Cross triptych, ca. 1455, oil on panel, 75\u00bc \u00a357in.

But the reflected face in the polished armor\u2014demonstrably gestur-ing to Eyckian catoptrics, as we will see\u2014tells a differentstory, and signals the ethical as well as pictorial ingenuity behind the motif. Burgkmair's specularized Jewish soldieremblematizes a strong penitential theme running throughtheBasilikabilder cycle, one that connected the humanist aspi- rations of the painter to the spiritual regimen favored by the nuns: the theme of Christ's \"perpetual Passion.\" At the risk of overtaxing a single motif with big claims, I nd thatBurgkmair's embedded mirror motif in the Augsburg Cruci-xion amounted to a kind of reflexive lens for compellingChristian penitential conscience toward another form of rec- ognition, one that likewise entailed the overcoming of blind- ness:recognition of the Self. What the doubled image of the blind Jew and his seeing reflection gures forth, in otherwords, is a \"Judaizing\" perversity within the Christian Self\u2014that part of the subject that perennially slides back into blind-ness and sin, fails the test of recognition, denies Christ, andafflicts his suffering body again and again. Burgkmair's half-hidden motif is directed against a narrative \"nobody,\" and, given its marginal visibility, it practically addresses nobody, too. Yet it is precisely for these reasons that, in the end,it accuses everybody. It does so in its negative capacity asdouble failure of recognition. 2Hans Burgkmair the Elder, Crucixion, of Basilikabild depicting S.

An unusual word formed by a double priva-tive, literally meaning \"not not knowing,\" anagn ^orisis is typically translated as \"recognition,\" but sometimes as \"discovery,\" or even \"disclosure.\" In the closest thing he gives to a formal denition in the Poetics (chapter 11), Aristotle calls it, simply, \"a change from ignorance to knowledge.\" 10 Within his scheme for the tragic arts, recognition was one oftwo key ingredients he claimed poets and playwrights must deploy in crafting the best kind of plot, or mythos (the other key ingredient being peripeteia, usually rendered as \"reversal\"). In Sophocles's Electra, for example, the twinned moments in which identity unfolds between sister and brother, wrenching trials of proof that bring a release of pas-sionate joy when knowledge becomes certain, qualify as theanagn ^orisis, while the attendant realization that Orestes will, after all, take his revenge against Clytemnestra is the peripe- teia. These narrative devices, as Aristotle explains earlier in the book (chapter 6), represent the surest means by whichthe poet discharges his essential duty of arousing the emo-tions of his audience. Complex plot may be achieved solely 3Hans Burgkmair, detail of Fig. 2, showing the Good Centurion, ofcer, and soldier in confrontation (artwork inthe public domain; photographprovided by BPK, Berlin / Art ELDER' S CROCE IN GERUSALEMME use of anagn ^orisis or solely through peripeteia, but the plots Aristotle prefers employ them both and derive both from the action itself. As a dynamic pivot of narrative, recognition pervades the Western canon (as well as monuments of Islamic literary cul- ture) and operates across the full spectrum of genres, fromscripture, tragedy, and comedy to epic, romance, and thenovel. 11Recent literary studies have highlighted the ways rec- ognition doubles as a device for structuring action withinnarrative and as a trope for the reader's comprehension outside it. Critics who have pursued the theme speak of a broad-based \"poetics of revelation\" that the \"experience ofcoherence.\" 12Art history, for its part, is well equipped with models for analyzing visual narrative and its own methods forcharacterizing the forms of attention that artists thematize within their pictures, 13and we have grown ever more sophisti- cated in how we infer and describe that attentiveness. Despiteall of this, art historians have been slow to grasp recognition'ssignal importance as a trope of visual disclosure and reflexive comprehension for the beholder. 14And it's no wonder. Recognition is freighted with far-reaching epistemologicalproblems and comes packed with the meanings its historicallyshifting uses have engendered. The word feels both genericand overdetermined. But the potential is there to make pro- ductive use of the concept alongside literary history's \"poetics of disclosure.\" To venture as much, while avoiding the pitfallsof a rote methodological transfer from another disciplineinto our own, is one of my goals. Setting aside the questionof Aristotle's currency among late medieval dramatists (letalone painters), it seems clear that the narrative function ofrecognition and recognition tropes found an important placein the poetic, visual, and dramatic arts long before the Eliza- bethan playwrights began consciously redeploying it. Our interest here, of course, lies in recognition's function within a Christian narrative poetics, verbal and visual, where it is often keyed as a conversion trope. 15To see this requiresrst of all an understanding of the dramatic and structuralroles reserved for recognition in Christianity's own charternarratives. As Diana Culbertson has shown, the Gospelsemploy recognition frequently. Across the gamut of scenesfrom Infancy and Ministry to Passion and Resurrection, fromthe Adoration of the Kings, say, to the Supper at Emmaus,the disclosure of identity, together with the character trans-formations urged by new knowledge function as something like the very \"model of the subjective apprehension of reve- lation.\" 16Recognition is strategically combined with plot reversals, peripeteia, in several crucial instances, notably, the Crucixion, while it appears independent of any signicantplot shifts in others, for example, the Transguration or theNoli me tangere. In all of these scenes, and for all the charac-ters involved, the transforming knowledge at issue unfoldsaround the challenge of christological presence: Jesus's half- disclosed divine nature, his messianic identity as the Son of Man foretold in Daniel, the Christ of prophecy. Exemplary as a moment of recognition is the conversion of the Good Centurion, the Roman legionnaire who watchedJesus expire at close range and, on hearing the nal cry fromthe Cross, pointed upward to declare, \"Truly, this was God\" (Matt. 27:54; Mark 15:39; compare Luke23:47). 17Once scales of experience tip in favor of revela- tion and faith, the Good Centurion becomes a powerful foilfor those gures of lesser conviction surrounding him withinthe narrative, characters to whom he is sometimes shown giv-ing eloquent instruction. To those outside the narrative,meanwhile, he often appears as a theatrical interlocutor, ashe does with breathtaking verve in Pordenone's great sceneof 1521 in Cremona Cathedral; the Good Centurion mayeven serve as a kind of \"delegate,\" to use Andrea Catellani's term, a gure who offers the beholder a running course in spiritual self-observation from within the picture. 18His clear- eyed confession holds up a mirror, an exhortation to theinner conversion everyone must undergo on witnessing God(as we will see, this role elevates the reflective armor the char-acter often sports into something far more signicant thanmilitary wardrobe). 19 Still, there is more to the character's exemplarity than this. As the Gospel story unfolds, the Centurion makes his confes-sion on Calvary and then later testies to Jesus's death beforePilate (Mark 15:45), making the reader aware that his procla-mation of christological identity is, and has to be, twofold:\"Jesus was the Son of God\" and\"Jesus is dead.\" knowledge: Christ's death happenedfor the sake of human salvation, for my sake (pro me ) and everyone else's (pro nobis ). And it is this enfolding par- Christian subjecthood. Typological exegesis iswoven into the \"complex plot\" of the Gospels at nearly everyturn, producing a comprehensive set of demands for anyreader who aspires to proceed from knowledge to experi-ence, from disclosure to discipleship, from flesh to spirit.Prophecy has been fullled, and so must the comprehensionof the beholder, who, like the reader addressed by Mark, watches not just a new story unfold but, along with it, \"the negation of one's past self,\" the self embedded in theold story and the old text. 21The Centurion's confession, Werner Kelber, \"turns the bystanders' [carnal] 4Hans Burgkmair, detail of Fig. 2, showing the reflection of the soldier's face in the Good Centurion's polished armor (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by BPK, Berlin / Art Resource, NY)292ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2014 VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 3concept of seeing right side up. He 'sees' (kai id ^on) the Son of God revealed in the void of godforsakenness and death, and thus becomes the [Markan narrative's] rst and onlytrue believer.\" 22Abrogated in this nearly instantaneous pas- sage from sense perception to the \"putting together\" ofunderstanding, from seeing to knowledge, is the very crisis ofexperience Christ's closest disciples endure until the story'sclosing episodes. Thomas's nonrecognition of Jesus's divine nature, for example, is not overcome until sensuous proof, in the form of touch, is vouchsafed him in John 20:29,and even then it is proclaimed to be an inferior path toknowledge. As transformative experience , the reckoning of salvic iden- tity in the person of Jesus recurs throughout the Gospel textsand anchors several kinds of epistemological problems withwhich the Evangelists were concerned. Commenting on the reflexive function of christological recognition in Mark, Culbertson writes: The disciples in Mark's chapter 10 are told what will hap-pen and so are the readers, the primary hearers of thisannouncement, but information is not enough becausethe weight of the message goes beyond cognitive enlight-enment. To comprehend the message in its fullness requires an experience that the characters at this point in the narrative do not have and, for that matter, the readersmay not have either. Mark's Gospel is about the difcultyof understanding, not the difculty of getting the rightinformation. The message is frequently subjectivelyincomprehensible at the time it is uttered. The fullness oftruth is present to characters in Mark's narrative only aspromise. It is not difcult to wonder why the content of such a message was not grasped: experience had not caught up to the message. 23 Readers and listeners outside the narrative, and participants inside, burdened by the same liabilities, must make the samedifcult passage from knowledge to experience. Yet transfor-mative experience often lags behind revelation; the past-anchored self resists the challenge of the new. Aware of this, ancient dramatists, the Evangelists included, sought ways to stagger the pace of these two passages\u2014from disclosure toknowledge, from knowledge to experience\u2014within the samediagesis. At the Passion story's climax, however, at themoment when the hero's very death becomes disclosure,the two are forced into sudden alignment. A gauntlet isthrown down; subjectivity nds itself at a crossroads. Broughtto acknowledgment of events for which we are not prepared, we face a dizzying incoherence and are compelled to test our- selves against those models and antimodels around us: notonly models of conversion like the Centurion but also anti-models of spiritual blindness and stubborn resistance(the pagans and Jews), as well as models of unwillingness to be prepared (Jesus's disciples in Mark 8:31-32). 24Thus, failure\u2014the failure of failure that haunted Augustine's expe- rience of conversion in the Confessions \u2014remains an ever- present possibility, not least of all for the reader before the text or the beholder before the image. Disclosure requireseyes to see, but inner transformation requires a heart thatrecognizes, \"sees\" spiritually, and knows. \"The hidden meta-phor of that text is not a closed room nor even an enigma,but a half-blind reader.\" 25 This dynamic reflexivity in the experience of disclosure, self-knowledge, and inner transformation is what assures rec-ognition's gurative reach beyond the objective happeningsof literary plot. A whole phenomenology of Christian devo-tional art, one suspects, might be organized around this notion. More modestly, it can be used to test a visual motif that is itself already a challenging metapicture, a reflectionmotif that crystallizes the pressures and challenges of ana- gn^orisis . Burgkmair's conceit rises to this level not simply by virtue of its metamorphic and reflexive potentials (attribut-able to nearly all mirroring motifs) but by dint of its func-tional context: through the situated intentions of its maker,and with the tacit sympathies of its patron and its principal audience. To see how our motif thematizes the challenge of recognition, its opportunities and pitfalls, its powers and dan-gers, we must rst get to know a group of Passion players whohave, by and large, flown under the radar of iconographers,despite their noisy and ostentatious presence on Golgotha.I'm referring to the colorful and critical mass of charactersarrayed at the base of the Cross, some of them directly in thecompany of the Good Centurion. Centurion and Soldier in South German Passion Tradition For late medieval altar painters in northern Europe, the castof characters around the Good Centurion was a farrago of bitplayers, loosely derived from the four Gospel accounts of theCrucixion, 26elements of local visual tradition, including Passion plays,27and the manuscript tradition that set \"sacred realism\" on its brilliant course. As efforts to further augment the mass of Fu\u00dfvolk on Calvary intensied\u2014Elisabeth Roth dates the emergence of the true \"volkreiche Kalvarienberg\" to the 1420s28\u2014German and Austrian painters in particular, seeing great opportunity in this \"assembly of the wicked,\"transformed the biblical metaphor into a motley crew com-posed of Jewish priests, scribes, and ofcials mingling withpassersby, outcasts, vagabonds, and a soldiery of decidedlymultiethnic hue. Altar painters outtted some of those mili- tary men as feudal knights, some as flamboyant mercenaries or grunting knaves, still others as turbaned foreigners ofswarthy skin, kinky hair, and bad teeth, with exotic or exag-gerated features both comical and monstrous (Fig. 5). 29 Sometimes subtly, sometimes crassly, fteenth-century altarpainters conjured up soldier gures with markedly \"Jewish\"physical traits or other identifying signs. Perhaps they imag-ined them as Caiaphas's henchmen, or members of Herod's palace guard, to distinguish them from Pilate's Roman forces. 30Pushed off to the margins or engulfed in a crush of bodies and horses below the crosses, some hurl curses,snicker, or snarl like dogs; 31others watch the execution with silent expressions of contempt. Contrary to what their marginal position might suggest, however, these rabblers are hardly incidental to the dialecticof witnessing around the Cross. In fact, these rufans and cutthroats could, in the hands of some painters, nd their way to the center of the action as individualized characters.No scriptural, apocryphal, or dramatic source of which I amaware gives them tradition-honored names of the kindHANS BURGKMAIR THE the blind the Good and Bad Thieves (Dysmas andGestas, respectively); for all the colorful vulgarity GermanPassion dramatists put in the mouths of the executionersand the Good Centurion's troop, the casting in the extantplaybooks I have examined is always generic so on). 32Nonetheless, as the following selective survey of the south German tradition from which Burgkmair's art emerged makes clear, there were compelling precedents forgiving one of these soldiers, the one cast as the Centurion'sprimary interlocutor, a specic dramatic role. Twenty-seven years before up his gro- tesque, grinning soldier to fulll that role, an Augsburg mas- ter of the preceding generation, working for the Cistercians of Kloster Kaisheim near Donauw \u20acorth, 33depicted a ghostly reflection in half-length, emerging from the dark translucentdepths of the Good Centurion's polished breastplate(Figs. 6, 7). 34Its fleshly counterpart, a flamboyantly dressed soldier in a brocaded yellow and red robe, appears as a full-length gure against the right edge of the panel (Randgur ). From the waist down he is turned nearly to a dorsal position, but the painter has rotated the upper body to a three-quarter view, allowing the head to turn more or less convincinglytoward the Centurion in prole. Without the benet ofbanderoles and the Centurion's telling pointing gesture, thepainter has his interlocutors in nearly motionless con-frontation, their expressionless gazes locked together, man attentive above. By contrast,the pair of turbaned \"chief priests\" in the foreground areshown rushing to the scene and gesticulating as one of them,mouth open in speech, looks up toward Jesus in angry confu-sion. Golgotha's \"sinister\" dramatis personae are reduced to these two representative pairs; only a single befuddled foot soldier, who from his position near the panel's right edgelooks up toward the Bad Thief with a grimace, is added asstaffage. A second version of Calvary by the same painter, roughly equal in size to the Kaisheim Crucixion, is set against agold-ground sky (Fig. 8). 35To offset the gold's flattening effect the painter has pulled back the point of view for a more organic integration of spatial zones, while also temper- ing the herky-jerky the painter has traded a magistrate type, fashionably dressed and fully the Cen-turion's equal in dignity and good looks. One hand signalspolite inquiry, while the other rests on an antique shieldadorned with a repouss /C19e head that seems to glare across the foreground space toward the swooning Virgin. Turning toward the man, the Centurion leans casually on his halberd (Fig. 9). We have little information about the origins or training of the Swabian painter known as the Master of 1477, namedafter the numerals he illusionistically \"carved\" into the bone-strewn turf of Golgotha in the second painting just described.But the awareness of Westphalian, lower Rhenish, and northNetherlandish modes and models he demonstrates across his small oeuvre\u2014which includes several drawings and book illustrations\u2014has been apparent to scholars since 1928,when Ernst Buchner proposed a coherent group of worksaround the dated Augsburg panel. 36Whether or not the mas- ter discovered his Netherlandish models on his own or foundthem mediated in the works of south German painters whohad already assimilated the Rogierian and Boutsian raw mate-rial is not important for our present purposes. At issue is what the combined Netherlandish, Rhenish, and Westphalian tra- ditions had to teach an painter of the generationpreceding Burgkmair's about the Centurion-soldier motif,its narrative meanings, and what could be accomplished bysituating metallic reflections within the zone of dramaticrepartee. Two fourteenth-century Passion altarpieces, studied in tan- dem, take us deeper inside the iconographic tradition and the Centurion-soldier pair's meaning before 1400. The rst resides in the unknown Westphalian artist, possiblyfrom Mainz, surveys a riotous crowd of onlookers, a sceneenlivened further by the profusion of gilded haloes andostentatious headgear (Fig. 10). 37Despite the fact that the Centurion's pointing gesture is half hidden behind another gure's head, his confession is made visible by the banderole unfurling on the opposite side of his ermine-lined hat. Thispositioning gives his speech act a twofold aspect: in onerespect, a confession universally addressed, in another, a 5Calvary , Austrian or Franconian, ca. 1440-50, mixed technique on panel, 58 \u00a343\u00bc in.

Bearded and swarthy,armored and richly turbaned, this gure must be countedamong the close ancestors of Burgkmair's caricature in Augs-burg. Dialogue between the men is strongly implied; in alllikelihood it was conceived as the kind of exchange Passionplaywrights used to expose the gap between the convertedand the hard of heart, which they often elaborated to comic effect. Whatever recalcitrance may have been imputed to his character, however, remains unspoken: no speech scroll isafforded the soldier, only an uncomprehending stare. What is merely implied by the Centurion-soldier confron- tation at Idar-Oberstein is played out explicitly in the duelingbanderoles of a slightly earlier work, also of Westphalian ori-gin, from the Church of St. Mary in Dortmund, a commemo-rative Passion altarpiece made for the Berswordt family (Fig. 12). 38Here, the Centurion's visible speech arcs grace- fully from a pointing nger.

Although there is noth- ing explicitly Jewish about the gure offering the taunt in the Berswordt Altar (Fig. 13), his placement close by a gurebearing a dark, dirty, and diabolical countenance similar tothat of Burgkmair's soldier in Augsburg xes his bloodguiltby association, as it were. In fact, the Centurion is nearly engulfed by Jewish denunciations of the christological moment: below his upraised right arm, in a rare icono-graphic motif derived from John 19:21-22, two Jews disputewith a seated Pilate who holds a quill and an inkpot to signifyhis authorship of the titulus, still held in his lap. \"Write not king [of the Jews] [Noli scribere Rex the chief Unfurling opposite theirs, Pilate's speechscroll supplies the retort, \"What I have written, I have written [Quod scripsi scripsi ].\" 39 Indulging a fascination with the physiognomic signs of spiritual and moral perversity, late medieval altar painters seem to have relished the opportunity for creative mischiefin representing the biblical crowd [ochlos ] that called for Jesus's crucixion. 40Every artist knew how to supplement his own inventiveness with borrowings, grafting, adaptations,and downright thefts. A drawing now in London, once attrib- uted on stylistic grounds to Holbein the Elder's younger brother Sigmund, 41assembles four character studies from various Netherlandish and Westphalian sources: a scowlingJew (upper left) taken Christ inthe Alte Pinakothek, Munich; 42a half-bald man (lower left), adapted from the Master of Sch \u20acoppingen's Halderner Altar in the Landesmuseum, M \u20acunster;43a beardless man, perhaps a beadle (lower right), similar to heads found in two draw-ings associated with Albert Bouts; 44and a turbaned \"chief priest\" (upper right) whose source has not yet been identi- ed but who reappears with different headdress in one of two surviving apostle-martyrdom panels from a dismemberedaltarpiece attributed to Sigmund Holbein, now inR\u20acodelheim, near Frankfurt (Fig. 14). 45Each of these heads, in all likelihood, came from other drawn intermediaries, notthe \"source\" paintings themselves. Of key interest in the pres-ent context is the head craning up from the lower left:adorned with unruly eyebrows, forelock, and muttonchops, he bares his teeth and snaps out a curse, inscribed on the sheet: \"Vach qui destruis demplum!\" (Ah, you who destroyedthe temple).

That the man sufferingon the Cross cannot even save himself becomes \"proof,\" inthe blind eyes of the evildoers, that Jesus is no messiah. InMatthew this is the rst of two taunts from the crowd for Jesusto come down from the Cross; the second of these, as we saw earlier, uttered \"in like manner also\" by \"the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients\" (27:42), formed the basis ofthe soldier-interlocutor's dramatic utterance in the Bers-wordt Altar (Fig. 13). At Idar-Oberstein the same blasphemous utterance, visible in a furling banderole, is \"spoken\" by a passerby on stageright, next to the spear bearer wearing a peaked \"Jewish\" cap(Fig. 10). With white hairs sprouting from under a black hood and tongue a-wag, this comic miscreant is a close coun- terpart to the cursing scoundrel of the London model sheet.He is also half bald, and shaved or bald heads, as RuthMellinkoff has shown, are typically signs of evil. 46Suspended between the monstrous and the burlesque, products of bothgrotesque imagination and pictorial rummaging and reuse,the tormentors and blasphemers late medieval artists litteredthrough the Calvary crowd were broadly evocative of that primitive state of \"godlessness\" deplored in the opening verses of Psalm 52/53:1-2: \"The fool said in his heart: Thereis no God. are corrupted, and [have] become abomina-ble in [their] iniquities.\"The Jew in the Mirror Grotesque faces in \"the crowd\" were often interchangeably generic; just as often they were interchangeably Jewish, andcaricatured as such. Devotional art, literature, and drama allshared this preoccupation. Late medieval Passion tracts suchas John of Caulibus's Meditations on the Life of Christ (ca. 1300), to take but one example, made it abundantly clearthat the mocking demands for \"proof\" of Jesus's divinitycame from the mouths of impious Jews, 47and late medieval panel painters were equally determined to populate their pic-tures with specically Jewish jeers and sneers. Rising abovethe farrago of gamblers, soldiers, and vagrants assembledaround the cross of the Bad Thief in the Kempten Master'sboisterous Calvary of about 1460-70, now in Nuremberg, a pair of Jewish ofcials sniff and snort behind the back of theCenturion, whose bright-eyed glint of recognition is matchedonly by the gleam of his armor and the jeweled brooch of his headdress (Fig. 15). 48One of the deriders, cast in the visual clich a \"chief priest,\" enumerates proofs against Christ's kingship with his right hand, while a banderole held in his left\u2014the verbal supplement to his pointing gesture\u2014speaksthe character's ei]\"(He saved others; himself he cannot save.

Arguably, Burgkmair had the stereotypedfeatures associated with \"the Turk\" in mind, or alsoin mind, for Orientalizing traits and motifs played quite loosely across late medieval stereotypes of Muslim and Jew, particularly in the eclecticism of costume. 52Healsoshares in that mytholog- ically evocative \"monstrous\" feature that so fascinated Italianhumanists, physicians, and artists later in the sixteenth cen-tury: hirsutism. 53 These \"also s\" illustrate the point: Burgkmair's ugly soldier enfolds a semiotic surplus. Given this surplus, I would arguethat we need not engage in motif hunting so as to arrive at a better iconographic or folkloric pedigree for the gure; the larger problematic it crystallizes does not, in other words,require that we pin down the particular physiognomic codesof Otherness the artist is deploying. 54Veritable galleries of malevolently ugly and subhuman \"Jewish\" faces ll out themultigured Passion scenes by Burgkmair's senior colleagueon the Augsburg painting scene, Hans Holbein the Elder(ca. 1460-1524), in particular, the three great altarpiece proj- ects Holbein and his shop completed between 1494 and 1502 (at least one of these projects, the altarpiece made for theKaisheim monastery and now in Munich, Burgkmair wouldhave had ample opportunity to study). 55Following this lead, 12Crucixion, center panel of the Berswordt Altarpiece (Passion Altarpiece), Westphalian, ca. 1390.Evangelical Church of St. Mary,Dortmund (artwork in public domain; photograph by R \u20acudiger Glahs) 13Crucixion , detail of Fig. 12, showing the soldier with speech scroll and pointing gesture (artwork in the public domain; photograph by R \u20acudiger Glahs)298ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2014 VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 3Burgkmair has constructed his grotesque Jew from a tion of negative signiers, producing a hypertrophied maskof Otherness that borders on the comic. The perennial ques-tion of the artist's social experience with living Jews is closeto moot in Burgkmair's case, since not only his own but hisfather's generation as well came of age in a Christian commu-nity whose last enfranchised Jewish residents had beenexpelled by its town council\u2014in apparent deance of the German king\u2014in 1439. 56This is not to say that Jews could not have gured strongly in the collective memory of the imperial city; one suspects that the absence of real Jewish neighbors, and the lack of those close commercial ties thatwere the norm in south German cities after the dislocationsof the plague years, catapulted \"the Jew\" into the Christiancultural imaginary all the more intensely as a reication, agure of reprobacy compelling outer fascinations and intro- spective anxieties. 57Although neither of these issues can be properly pursued here, there can be little doubt that theprotoethnographic perspective Burgkmair adopted for otherprojects is also a factor: the ambitious, multisheet woodcutproject of 1508, Peoples of Africa and India (1508), for exam- ple, seems anticipated in the purposeful description of\"ethnic\" traits the artist lavished on the dark face of the Augs-burg Crucixion's blaspheming soldier. 58 14Workshop of Hans Holbein the Elder, Model Sheet with Four Heads, pen and ink and washes and white highlights on red- toned paper, 10 \u00be\u00a37 in.

In the Augsburg Cruci-xion, that denuncuation is expressed in gesture (Fig. 3).Degrading what the Centurion exalts, the ugly Jewish soldierpoints downward with a mailed hand, joining those who demand that Jesus demonstrate his divinity by coming down from the Cross (Matt. 27:40, 42). What the character enactsis a resistance to transformative knowledge, a rebellionagainst God, a stubborn refusal to \"see\" anything beyond thecarnal immolation of the Cross, thus, an unwillingness tojoin the Centurion in conversion. Hardly content to make his gure the mere embodiment of a narrative function, however, Burgkmair fleshes out the soldier's moral character, and this troubles any straightfor- ward attribution to him of a demonic or subhuman enmity.A closer look tells us that the stereotyped Jewish ugliness ofthe gure is no mere mask of hatred (Fig. 4). As he addressesthe Centurion a perverse smile spreads over his face. Fawningin the presence of his superiors, he seems intent on playingthe fool. For their part, the Centurion and his fellow ofcerlook on the display of obsequiousness with angry condescen- sion, on the one hand, and something like bemused pity, on the other. And there is more, as we have already noted:another judging gaze, this one hurled back on the Jew by hisown image. This specular doppelg \u20acanger appears to be visible to no one within the scene, least of all its flesh-and-bloodcounterpart, who looks right past while smirking at the Cen-turion. And far from miming the Jew's oash grin, as we havealready observed, this mirrored other, glinting out from the shiny surface, mouth agape, seems to recoil in horror at the spectacle before it. What does the spectral Jew in this metamorphic reflection see that the real Jew cannot, or will not? What does it meanthat the reversed visage offered up by the mirror, the \"other\"of the Self, recognizes the truth about the Self while itselfbeing overlooked, unrecognized, by its other? Assuming thatBurgkmair adopted the reflection motif from the Master of 1477's Calvary (Figs. 6, 7) and that he grasped its reflexive potential as an image within an image, what compelled him to develop the borrowed motif in this particular way? It is tempt- ing to interpret the gesture as little more than a painterlyconceit or a quixotic antiquarian play on the grotesquemasks that used to decorate ancient arms and armor (Fig. 9),the dead repouss /C19e Gorgon transformed, as it were, into an animate specter that mocks the living. That Burgkmair might have reached beyond his own milieu, nding inspiration for the motif in the Netherlandish tradition of embedded reflec-tions, \"self-illuminating\" oil colors, and pictorial plays on clas-sical tropes, 59is also conceivable. Alternatively, one might locate it within the late medieval and early modern iconogra-phy of folly, where buffoons and jesters are routinely mockedby their doubles, some staring out from handheld mirrors, 60 others depicted as grotesque animate heads sprouting from phallic baubles, as in Heinrich Vogtherr the Younger's creepy Schalksnarr woodcut of 1540.61But there is clearly more to Burgkmair's reflected soldier than a display of paint-erly prowess, an exercise in imagination or classical citation,a critique of the \"godless fool,\" or anti-Semitic caricature,and by ruling out these possibilities we are led to the follow-ing question: What would it have meant to the Christian viewer to see his archetypal Other, the Jew, ridiculed in hisblindness by his specular Other, and this precisely at themoment of the Savior's death\u2014at the scene of christologicalrecognition, conversion, and their \"Jewish\" opposites? The answer to be developed here begins from an acknowl- edgment of the ethical importance late medieval Christianculture placed on the subject's penitential self-recognition as a sinner, as a being burdened with death and the reprobatecarnality Adam's disobedience brought upon the humanrace. Drawing on a key guration within patristic and medie-val thought of Judaism's inherent dangers, I argue thatBurgkmair's moral target turns out to be that \"Judaizing\"part of the Christian Self, the carnal enemy within who, through its ceaseless sinning, betrays Christ to his enemies, abandons him on the Cross, and meets his loving mercy withingratitude. 62Failed recognition of God and failed recogni- tion of Self reflect one another and arouse the same anxiety.By tracing the ever-present challenge of self-recognition back into the Gospel story's foundational challenge of christological recognition, in other words, the artist situates the beholderat the intersection of these two inescapable tests of Christian identity. Art historians have long understood mirror reflections to be a special kind of image-within-an-image. Never neutral or passive relays of reality, catoptric motifs are always, in onesense or another, meta-images: that is, they are either trans-formative (metamorphic), coded (metaphoric), reflexive(metapictorial), or some combination of these. 63Our per- spective here must be limited to the century preceding Burgkmair's work at the Katharinenkloster. For the Nether- landish masters who exploited the translucence of oil paint-ing to produce flawless visions of optical reality, and forwhom the convex mirror was a standard workshop tool, thepictured mirror became, in Meyer Schapiro's memorablewords, \"a model of painting as a perfect image of the visibleworld.\" 64Numerous scholars since have shown how reflective convex surfaces of all kinds, not just mirrors proper, could function within paintings \"to create a more complete and substantial representation of space,\" as Jan Bia \u00bbostocki has described the panoptic reach of Saint Michael's cuirass inHans Memling's Last Judgment altarpiece now in the National Museum in Gda /C19nsk. 65Credit for the most far-reaching inno- vations in this arena is usually awarded to Jan van Eyck, whofamously used reflections to situate the moment of witness-ing within the visual eld as it crystallized in his gaze. In his sparkling devotional epitaph of 1436, the Virgin with the Canon George Van der Paele , van Eyck distributed multiple images of the enthroned Queen of Heaven across the scal- loped round ridges of the saint's polished helmet, as well asxing his own presence, his own act of artisanal spectator-ship, in the gleaming bronze of the epauliere. 66Recent schol- arship attuned to medieval and early modern image theoryhas elevated the embedded mirror reflection into something likethepreeminent meta-image, a supermotif that insistently refers discourse to the problematic veracity of images, the variability and fallibility of sight, the dangers and pleasures ofillusion\u2014but also, ironically, the superiority of painting over300 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2014 VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 3other arts.67Scholarly interest has massed around Leon Bat- tista Alberti's original interpretation of the Narcissus myth in book 2 of Della pittura (1435-36), where the pool's reflective image paints the young hunter as a primal desiring subjectand, simultaneously, as the rst beholder of pictures. \"Whatis painting but the act of embracing by means of art the sur-face of the pool?\" asks Alberti in the famous passage, winkingto his humanist readers with a clever appropriation of Philo- stratus the Elder's ekphrastic exercise in the Eikones . More germane for my interpretation of Burgkmair's sol- dier motif in the Augsburg Crucixion is the ethical thread running through classical and postclassical interpretations,verbal and visual, of the Narcissus myth: the mirror image'sstatus as a trope of philosophical self-examination, its risks,and its rewards. Ancient writers implicitly understood thatthe mirror could serve the subject as an instrument of moral betterment, for it provided, as Shadi Bartsch explains, \"a tool for the splitting of the viewer into viewing subject and viewedobject.\" 69Ovid's portrayal of Narcissus at the moment of his self-recognition in the pool is the classic negative exemplumof this self-splitting: \"iste ego sum: sensi, nec mea fallitimago\" (I am he. I realize. My image/my reflection no longerdeceives me) (Metamorphoses 3.463). Yet the ethical challenge wrought by the illusion's fracture is one this particular sub- ject fails, since, as H /C19erica Valladares points out, the experi- ence \"does not result in a corresponding critical distance from his own reflection\" but only an \"awareness of the eroticparadox in which he is caught and its attendant impossibilityof fulllment.\" The result, in Ovid's telling of the tale, was \"anew kind of madness [novitasque furors]\" (Met. 3.350). 70What Narcissus failed to achieve every mirror image promises: atherapeutic reversal of subject and object relations. When it succeeds, the viewer, the owner of the gaze, simultaneously becomes the viewed, the target of the gaze; the possibility ofself-knowledge flits into view. Yet the enterprise, like anyeffort to transmute sense impression into understanding, wasalways understood as inherently vexed. Commenting on theancient motto Nosce te ipsum (Know Thyself) along- side a Narcissus-like mirror-gazing gure in the decorativeprogram of his own Bologna, the physician and naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522-1605) expresses the con- ventional wisdom, \"Admiring one's face is most easy. Toknow one's internal self has always been reputed to bedifcult.\" 71 Bartsch aptly terms the subject-object reversal that opens the door to self-knowledge a \"momentary dislocation of self-identity\" and distinguishes it from the self-splitting leadsto Cartesian enlightenment\u2014the familiar trope of the cogi- mind reflexively mirroring its own operations. In face- to-face societies the mirror's disclosure of a newly objectivepoint of view for the subject is notthat of the introspec- tive mind becoming self-aware; nor is it necessarily a surro-gate for the omnivoyance of God, whose surveillance elicitsshame and compels penitential self-correction. 72Rather, the dislocated subject is caught enacting a second-order, social role, learning to judge himself in light of commonly held val- ues and norms. Momentarily divided into subject and object, one sees oneself as others would, beyond appearances. Andit is here, at the scene of dawning self-knowledge, that themirror, despite its capacity to deceive, discloses a mostunsettling prospect onto truth, one that ancient and medie-val authors alike comprehended: the potential to confrontthe subject with the horror of the Self. In Christian thought this was the Self mired in sin, corrupted by worldly attach-ments, deformed by self-seeking, forgetful of Last Things,and alienated from God. 73Wishing only to escape from the dissociating shock such a reflection produces, the penitentialsubject nds the choice laid bare: either flee into the fantasy of mere appearances and remain blind to his true self, accepting sin and death as his lot, or use the mirror to con-vert, to \"turn\" away from sin and toward God. A rhymedinscription encircling Death's reflection in a fteenth-cen-tury engraving, pasted into a Book of Hours in Dublin andpreserved today as a unicum, recommends just this: \"In thismirror, so may I learn, how from sin, ought to turn [In desenspeigell, need for constant self-examination and vigilant reflec- tion on death was a major theme in ancient ethics, particu-larly Stoicism, and in the long history of Christianmonasticism, where penitential exercises served as a methodfor purifying the soul and making way for the birth of the\"new man.\" In the Middle Ages this preoccupation stimu-lated a proliferation of didactic and pastoral works, reachingfar beyond the monastery, bearing the title Speculum. 75As the idea of spiritual exercise was progressively retooled forthe needs of the laity, the broad-based ethos of self-observa-tion gave birth to a whole new domain of Christian ethicalart, tied largely to the imperative to prepare for death: ars moriendi, vanitas, memento mori, and related macabre and peni- tential themes. A whole regimen of spiritual therapy for thelaity was organized around their common logic. Eventuallydisseminated in popular form by the printing press, the new class of emblematic meditative images began as novelties styled for elites. A two-page opening from a Book of Hoursmade about 1500, probably in Bruges, for Joanna (\"theMad\") of Castile marks the transition from the book's calen-dar pages to its battery of meditative lists (Ten Command-ments, Seven Deadly Sins, Five Senses, Works of Mercy,Virtues, Gifts of the Holy Spirit, and so on). It includes theproleptic spectacle of a skull gazing out from inside a convex crystal, encircled by the text's putative title, \"Speculum con- sciencie,\" or \"Mirror of Conscience.\" Trompe l'oeil flower,pod, and berry specimens, interspersed with two butterfliesand a snail, surround the inset word-image composite(Fig. 17). 76By offering up to fleshly eyes a future vision of the Self unclothed by flesh, reminding us of what we willbecome and, in a sense, always were, the mirror, combiningmimesis and metamorphosis in a single gure, proves itself the instrument par excellence of a penitential optics. Such opportunities as mirrors afforded\u2014to \"see\" what carnalvision was too limited, and imagination too fear-struck, tofurnish\u2014constituted something like a heavenly therapy. Thistakes the form of competing parables in a roughly contempo-rary German broadsheet preserved in Stuttgart (Fig. 18). 77 The mirror held up to the luxury-loving young couple on theleft appears empty, tempting them to peer closer; whatever pleasing image comes to ll it will, the Devil holding it knows, guarantee their souls to him (likewise if it remains empty).What the angel's mirror furnishes the prudent burghers onthe right, by contrast, is that painful shock of recognitionHANS BURGKMAIR THE ELDER' S SANTA CROCE IN GERUSALEMME 301that leads from ignorance to insight, and from there to pen- ance. The horror of this \"true image\" will send them flee-ing\u2014fleeing from sin. Narrative imagery, too, and Passion imagery in particular, could serve as a kind of \"mirror of conscience,\" a site for pru-dent self-reflection, imitation of Christ, and spiritual therapy.Consider the admonition set forth by Arnoul Gr /C19eban, the mid-fteenth-century dramatist and canon of the church of Le Mans, in his great 35,000-verse vernacular play Le myst /C18ere de la Passion (already quoted in part in our epigram): Thus he moderates his painsby looking into this mirror,where every heart, to see its sorrow ought to profoundly consider itself. And so that you might see yourself thereand gently look at it,this pious mirror for your own goodwe bring before your eyes,in visible form, with characters.Look at yourself, if you are wise,each of you sees his form there: Anyone who really looks will really see himself. May God grant that if we look at ourselvesby looking we may perceive,after this moral life,the powerful immortal essencethat reigns inexhaustibly. 78 Put into play here is a certain kind of sensual didacticism that fosters proper (that is, spiritual) seeing and hearingas ethical activities for the audience. Gr /C19eban deploys the mir- ror metaphor to privilege what is visible to human eyes (\"senssiblement\") and what is performed \"with characters[par parsonnaiges],\" the whole enterprise of the play geared to individualized opportunities for self-examination, imitation,and ethical-spiritual improvement. Turning back to Burgkmair's Crucixion in Augsburg, we recall the character whose appearance onstage coincideswith the chance to see himself in the Passion's mirror, though he proves himself unable or unwilling to do so. Imprisoned in his own subject position by a contumaciouswill set on blasphemy, he is suspended before the possibilityof self-splitting and self-awareness. Only his specular dop-pelg \u20acanger registers any kind of awareness, disclosing the truth of a sinful reprobacy while going unheeded. Flashinginto view as an alien Other, the Jew's horried reflectionbecomes, in other words, an ethical Other. Burgkmair's obse- quious soldier makes himself risible and contemptuous notonly to those surrounding him but to himself as well. 17Master of the David Scenes (Bruges or Ghent), the beholder reflected as Death, from \"Speculum consciencie\" (Mirror of Conscience), in the Book of Hours of Joanna of Castile ,1496- 1506.

Paradoxically, the agency capable of recogni-tion remains the exclusive possession of the being who is nota person at all but a mere image: an illusory \"subject\" whohas nothing to gain, and nothing to lose, in possessing trueknowledge of the self. The profound difculty of seeing oneself for the sake of spiritual or moral improvement preoccupied a broad swath of sixteenth-century wr iters and artists who under- stood it to be an anthropological as well as ethical prob- lem. On the heels of Sebastian Brant's hugely popularNarrenschiff (1494) ,but in an entirely different rhetorical mode, Erasmus of Rotterdam placed the critique of fool-ish self-regard in the mouth of Dame Folly herself, ask-ing, \"is there any duty throughout life which you canperform gracefully as regards yourself or others ...unless you have self-love at hand to help you?\" In 1515 HansHolbein the Younger glossed this passage with a piquantpen and ink miniature in Basel schoolmaster OswaldMyconius's personal copy of the Moriae encomium, depict- ing a fool, epitome of the false man, deflated by themockery of his own reflection (Fig. 19). 79Wisdom requires, rst and foremost, recognizing folly as the pre-existing condition, so to speak, of both humanity and the self. Tricksters and folk heros such as Till Eulenspie- gel, whose name (meaning \"owl's mirror\") evidentlyderives from the old saying, \"One sees one's own faultsn om o r ec l e a r l yt h a na no w ls e e si t so w nu g l i n e s si nalooking glass,\" made a career of wearing down thedefenses that keep discomting recognitions at bay. 80In a far less humorous vein Sebastian Franck commentedin his Sprichw \u20acorter of 1541, Man remains forever in his affairs and towards himself blind and a fool. ...Likewise if a monkey and an owl were to be looking at themselves in a mirror, the nature ofanimal or man is so blind that each creature, obsessed by self-love, does not know himself, does not see himself, andcannot do so. 81 Midcentury contemporaries willing to think beyond the bounded categories of confessional knowledge\u2014Protestant and Catholic\u2014concurred. Pieter Bruegel's drawing of about 1558 (now in the British Museum) known as Elckembeds a tableau that likewise laments the hollow prospects for self-knowledge (Fig. 20).

That is, what Burgkmair stages as a stereotypically Jewish blindness stands here for the blindness of those Chris- tians who refuse to look into the penitential mirror\u2014that reflective surface out of which their own image as ungrateful,reprobate sinners stares back. It is a truthful vision of thesoul's alienated relationship to God that the Jew, by hisnature, remains unable to overcome, while the Christian, dis-tracted by the vanities of the world and immersed in his ownfoolish self-regard, remains unwilling. Confronting one's sin- ful self meant feeling the shock of recognizing the Jewwithin, oblivious to one's own guilt, ready to deny Christagain and again. To see Burgkmair's Nobody failing the testof salvic recognition on Golgotha thus renders the imageemblematic: its verbal equivalent, once unraveled, is theargument that nobody meets the challenge of self-recognition, nobody properly sees himself. The indictment mounts a chal- lenge to everybody, every Christian faithful who witnesses Christ crucied. Given his ambitions and humanist connections, the Burgk- mair of about 1504 would no doubt have agreed with the coming generation of moralists and reformers who railedagainst a Christian society in which nobody recognizes him-self. That the painter, later in his life, understood the twinimperatives of facing the horror of the Self without false con-solations and of regarding the mirror as a site of prudent self-reflection\u2014thus, proper self-recognition\u2014comes across in the imploring miens of Hans and his wife, Anna Allerlay,portrayed by Burgkmair's junior colleague in Augsburg,Laux (Lucas) Furtenagel, in the remarkable panel now inVienna, dated 1529 (Fig. 22). 84Building on a tradition of macabre portraiture stretching back to the early fourteenthcentury\u2014one that eventually came to include the subgenreof mortifying marriage portraits 85\u2014the Vienna panel presents us with a troubling double aspect: the couple asthey are (or once were), and the couple as they will be (oralways were). Folding time, it thus addresses a simultaneousaudience of present and future beholders, making it whatJoseph Koerner has called a \"proleptic epitaph.\" Above thepainter's head begins the panel's cascade of admonitoryinscriptions, with words set against the black recess: \"Suchwas our human form, but in the mirror nothing more than this.\" 86Above Anna's head a banderole calls out the ages of the sitters on the precise day (May 10, 1529) they were cap- tured in mortal likenesses,87while inside the crystalline orb she holds, embryonic doppelg \u20acangers float through a darkether (Fig. 23). Terrible in their xation on the flesh-and-blood others, the simian skull of Frau Burgkmair appearsamid a spray of red hair that mocks Anna's thinning locks,while a spectral Meister Hans, intent on chastising thepainter's vanity, glares across the breadth of the panel,mouth open, as if barking out a curse. Inscribed around themirror's edge is the admonition to recognize our true selves: ERKEN DICH SELBS . This complex humanist conceit for vanitas double por- trait is almost certainly Burgkmair's own.88Whether or not the portrait truly illustrates \"the antithesis between sinfuland prudent self-reflection,\" as James Marrow has argued, 89 there is no doubt we are being called to witness an act of self-recognition on the couple's part and admonished to recog-nize ourselves in the process. The mirror conjures up aglimpse of that which is blocked by the world of appearances and earthly attachments\u2014paradoxically, by the very body whose material presence brings it into focus in the rst place.That the metamorphic motif of a specular Other horried bywhat it sees\u2014an absent presence agency\u2014would reappear in Burgkmair's oeuvre twenty-ve years later, in a painting conceived as a visual testamentto the painter's own Christian virtue, casts a retrospectivelight on the importance of this visual trope of recognition in the painter's repertoire. Attentive to his chances for artistic self-display and intellectual self-assertion within the boundsof an important commission, Burgkmair projected into theAugsburg Crucixion's reflection motif a moment of autho- rial self-recognition , stolen back as a form of Christian virtue from a fleeting moment of narcissistic blindness. Basilikabilder : Imaginative Pilgrimage and Perpetual Passion What place, what role, what meaning did Burgkmair's reflec- tion motif assume within the larger cycle of paintings forwhich the Crucixion was designed, the six Basilikabilder commissioned between 1499 and 1504? As noted earlier,Burgkmair's scene, with its frieze of monumental standinggures and its Christ type adapted from his father's allegori-cal Crucixion in St. Maximilian, 90forms the upper two- thirds of the center section of a tympanum-shaped painting, measuring 7 feet 9 \u00beinches (2.38 meters) high and 11 feet 2\u00bd inches (3.415 meters) wide along the bottom edge, dedi- cated to the Roman church of S. Croce in Gerusalemme(Fig. 24). Occupying the lower tier of the center section is aseparate view of the church, freely rendered and perspectiv-ally folded, it seems, to allow us to glimpse the eastern choir'sexterior and at the same time something of the carved west-ern portal. Whatever else might be seen of the portal, and the painter's coy invitation to peek inside, is half hidden by a courtyard gate, on which Burgkmair signed the panel traveler's staves come and go: the maingroup, led by a local guide, seems to be departing and pass-ing advice along to a couple who are entering, accompaniedby their dog. Completing the tympanum ensemble are the half lunettes (each 80\u00bd by 45\u00bc inches, or 204.5 by 115 centi- meters) bracketing the stacked central panels; together theycomprise a sumptuous panorama taken from the Life ofSaint Ursula, specically, her martyrdom among the eleven304 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2014 VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 3thousand companions, a scene based principally on the Golden Legend.91High horizon lines allow Burgkmair to draw the virgin-martyr armada into the upper zones of the taperedpanels. Above a beautiful riverscape, simulated shrineworkintegrates the overall composition, rationalizing its consider-able shifts in gure scale. 92 Earlier, I pointed out that of the six Basilikabilder commis- sioned by the Dominican nuns, Burgkmair completed three, Hans Holbein the Elder two, and a certain Master L.F., prob- ably also from Augsburg, one.93Designed for installation in the convent's newly renovated chapter house, each of theensembles, with notable variations, is set in a pointed-archtympanum and adheres to the basic scheme just describedfor S. Croce: a Passion image placed above a \"view\" of one ofRome's basilican churches, complemented by hagiographicvignettes saints' portraits, corresponding either to the basilica's eponymous patron or the saint venerated by the panel's donor. Both notable exceptions to this schemeare from Holbein's hand: the Santa Maria Maggiore of 1499 , which replaces Passion imagery with a Coronation of the Vir-gin in the apex, and the San Paolo fuori le mura of 1504 ,which displaces architectural portraiture in the lower zone with acomplex staging of the apostle's martyrdom. In only a fewplaces do we nd donor portraits or family escutcheons. One of the ve documented donors, shown kneeling with a rosary in a panel long ago detached from the San Paolo ensemble, is Veronica Welser (d. 1531), daughter of the influential Augs-burg merchant and banking family (Fig. 25). 94Then-prioressof the Katharinenkloster, Welser is identied in an eigh-teenth-century chronicle (which refers to an older lostsource) as the donor of both the S. Paolo and S. Croce pan- els, for which she paid the two painters, Holbein and Burgk- mair, a total of 187 gulden. 95Whereas the former artist portrayed her directly, the latter commemorated her patron-age through the choice of martyrological legend (Welser'sgiven name was Ursula 96), on the one hand, and the inclu- sion of her family's coat of arms (lower right corner), on theother. Four other members of the order\u2014DorotheaRehlinger, Anna Riedler, Helena Raphon, and Barbara Ried- ler\u2014are recorded as project donors, along with the hono- raria they paid the painters. Like Welser, each hailed fromone of Augsburg's wealthiest and most influential patricianand merchant families. 23Lucas (Laux) Furtenagel, detail of Fig. 22, showing mirror reflections of Hans and Anna Burgkmair (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Erich Lessing, provided by Art Resource, NY) 22Laux (Lucas) Furtenagel, Hans Burgkmair at the Age of Fifty-Six and Anna Burgkmair at the Age of Fifty-Two , 1529, oil on limewood panel, 23 \u00a320\u00bd \u00a352 cm).

This campaign would eventually see, in 1498, much of the cloister refur- bished by between 1516 and 1517, the monasterychurch rebuilt in the newly fashionable Renaissanceidiom by the Augsburg architect Hans Heber (d. 1522),under Welser's watchful eye. Of the city's seven convents,the Katharinenkloster was the richest, largest, and \"most emphatically civic\"; its elite status was conrmed by a series of papal and royal privileges, granted since its foun-dation in the thirteenth century. 97 The privilege scholars have linked specically to the Basili- kabild project was an indulgence issued by Innocent VIII in 1487. Continuing a papal tradition of corporate dispensa-tions begun in the early fourteenth century, it bestowed onthe nuns and other visitors to the convent the opportunity to earn the same remission of sins granted those who journeyed to the seven basilicas of Rome\u2014without ever leaving the con-vent. These benets could be fully earned by anyone willingto visit \"three stations in the cloister ainpryorin zu zeyten geordnet send\"), and at each place three Our Fathers and three Ave Marias (\"an Latin bull has been lost, the German textexcerpted here was worked up for display around 1500 in theform of triptych, an object meant, in all likelihood, to serveas a commemorative plaque, or Gedenktafel, somewhere inside the convent. 98This suggests an effort to promote the con- vent's privilege, and its special relationship to Rome, within the specic context of the Jubilee year of 1500.99 On the face of it, then, each of the painted basilican \"portraits\" would seem to represent one station on a virtual Roman pilgrimage to the Sette Chiese, contained within theconvent walls for the benet of those traditionally forced tomake do with peregrinatio in stabilitate . Were the images intended to serve as spaces for imaginative journeys and med-itations, a set of visual prompts for the kind of pious visualiza- tions scholars have long associated with late medieval devotional images, Passion images in particular? Endorsed bya number of scholars, 100this understanding of the images as surrogates has also met with criticism. Christopher Wood, for 24Hans Burgkmair the Elder, Basilikabild depicting S.

A closelyrelated, and close by, instance of a plenary jubilee indul-gence designed to provide the sick, the lame, or the clois-tered similar access to the full \"r \u20acomischen Gnaden\" is the 1501 grant given to the Cistercians of nearby Kaisheim; fulll-ing the terms of the grant in this instance entailed prayerfulpilgrimage to seven altars within the monastery. 103 Even so, it is not necessary to assume such grants were understood as either xed or limited to the same stationsof prayer in perpetuity: the principle of commutatio, so widely applied in medieval pilgrimage culture, continuallygave rise to new relations of surrogacy based on equiva-lent indulgences. For instance, just as pilgrims to theseven Roman basilicas could earn the same remissionsgranted to those traveling longer distances to worship Christ at the loca sancta in Jerusalem\u2014medieval guide- books emphasized this advantage 104\u2014the possibility existed to replace that intramural church-to-church itiner- ary with a visit to the seven main altars of St. Peter's alone or even with visits to designated surrogates (churches oraltars) in northern Europe. Some degree of flexibility inhow the terms of the grant might have been fullled atthe Katharinenkloster may therefore be assumed; it would appear, furthermore, that s uch flexibility opened the door to innovation, including the idea of a picture cycle. By leaving the designation of the surrogate prayer sites(Stellvertreterst \u20acatten) within the convent to the discretion of the ruling prioress, Innocent's bull of 1487 tactfully antic-ipated a new conguration of liturgical stations, onemade possible by the very renovations it helped nance. Even if a strict version of the virtual pilgrimage thesis can- not be sustained by the evidence at the Katharinenkloster(let alone other monasteries in the city), 105it is hardly out of the question to imagine the \"prayer in three places\" stipula-tion being satised by the paintings, especially if we regardthe six panels as three pairs, something their installation inthe chapter house recommends. Medieval chapter rooms\u2014distinct within European monastery complexes from the elev-enth century on\u2014were multifunctional spaces for business and ritual. There the community might engage in commem- orative prayer on behalf of the house's dead benefactors,especially the notables among its own members (some ofwhom might nd privileged burial in the chapter roomitself); participate in quasiliturgical rituals such as collations,the reception of novices, or the weekly washing of feet ( man- datum ); or conduct institutional business of various kinds, including daily community meetings, elections, and the disciplining of errant brothers or sisters. All such ceremonies were served by a long tradition of centralizing design that ori-ented participants toward a central bay of the room, typicallyfurnished with an altar. 106Still preserved, St. Katherine's chapter room\u2014completed, along with the adjoining cloister (Kreuzgang ), in 1499\u2014is a square space with a round center column and net vaultsdivided into four equal bays; fenestration on the west wall left space for only six tympanum-shaped panels, two on each of the remaining walls. Working from the slight variations inshape and size, Magdalena G \u20acartner has resolved the discrep- ancies in previous attempts to reconstruct the hangingarrangement of the six panels, with the following result: thecycle began on the north wall, with Burgkmair's San Pietro on the left and Master L.F.'s combined San Lorenzo and San Sebastiano on the right; it continued clockwise with, on the east wall, Burgkmair's San Giovanni (shaped to t over the doorway) and Holbein's San Paolo next to it on the right; the cycle concluded on the south wall with Burgkmair's Santa Croce and Holbein's Santa Maria Maggiore (Fig. 26). the Holbein the Elder, panel, 15\u00bc \u00a39 in.

Close by the central column, the nuns nally installed an altar; consecrated in 1503, it was evidently adorned withHolbein's Saint Katherine Altarpiece of 1512, its now-lost shrine housing a Marian cult gure. 108 There can be little doubt that the lavish set of commis- sions, as Pia Cuneo has argued, marked an effort on the part of this wealthy enclave of Dominican nuns to reassert their place within a \"tradition of powerful and holy women,\"pledge their allegiance to the Roman Church, and therebyresist destabilizing reform efforts at a time of escalatinganticlericalism. 109However, female sanctity, patronage, and community building do not tell the whole story, and too greatan emphasis on these factors leaves the prominence of Pas- sion imagery in the overall project insufciently explained. As noted, ve of the six panels feature Passion scenes in theircentral panels' upper elds, setting each at the apex of itspointed-arch frame and aligning it with the architectural\"portrait\" below. 110Two of these ve, both products of the Holbein workshop, originally featured images of their donorskneeling in devotion before the scene of martyrdom: theSanta Maria Maggiore of 1499, with Dorothea Rehlinger embedded in Saint Dorothy's beheading at the lower right,and the San Paolo fuori le mura, to which the panel featuring Veronica Welser with her rosaries (Fig. 25) was once attached,also in the lower right position. 26Schematic reconstruction of the chapter room in the Katharinenkloster, Augsburg, showing the original dis-position of the Basilikabild panels, ca. 1505, from G \u20acartner, R\u20acomische Basiliken , p. 38, g. 10 (drawing /C211 G \u20acartner)308ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2014 VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 3Passion themes are also prominent in a number of tympa- num epitaphs, closely similar in shape to the Basilikabilder and of roughly equal dimensions, produced by the Holbein workshop for display in the adjoining Kreuzgang . One of these, completed in 1499 for the three cloistered daughtersof the 1500)\u2014showcases the mysticism associatedwith the rosary cult favored by the nuns (Fig. 27). 111Sepa- rated from the scenes they witness by slender trompe l'oeil tracery, the sisters kneel together beneath a dedicatory pla- quette: the Coronation of the Virgin in the apex, familyescutcheons on either side, six Passion scenes, and a vignetteportrait of Saint Veronica take their places on a multilevelstage spotlighted against a deep black. A continuous span ofturf unites the space of the nuns with the three scenes on thelower tier (Gethsemane, the Crucixion, and the Carrying ofthe Cross) and Veronica standing with her sudarium, while a receding expanse of tiled floor does the same for the three above (the Flagellation, the Crowning with Thorns, and PilateWashing His Hands). In order to reach the climax, the six-gure Crucixion in the lower tier, beholders must scan this\"out of order\" sequence that apparently seeks to harmonizeJohn 19 (where the hand washing is omitted) and Matthew27 (in which the Crowning follows Pilate's declaration of his own innocence). Just below Christ's outstretched left arm in that nal scene, the Good Centurion makes his confession to a man in a yellow tunic and flat-topped hat\u2014the same gurevisible among the henchmen in the Flagellation and HandWashing scenes above. Striding into the frame from its mar-gins, he likewise points upward toward Christ on the Cross asif posing a question. One additional detail in the Vetter epitaph deserves atten- tion for what it tells us about the penitential mysticism of the nuns. At the far left end of the second tier, continuous with the artfully contrived stage space of the torture scenes, two ofthe Passion's instruments, the birch rod and the flagellum,lie discarded on the floor; signlike in their isolation, theyuncannily point toward the nuns below, as if animated by the wish to be wielded anew. Read as mute testimony that the souls of the deceased have paid their debts of conscience\u2014even if that penitential task must be renewed among the liv-ing\u2014they stand here as vivid symbols of a total spiritual pro-gram. Grounded in Passion mysticism, Eucharistic piety, and,from the later fteenth century on, the cult of the rosary aswell, the regimen fostered in south German convents such asSt. Katherine's kept ascetic discipline enshrined in the order's history as a focal point of the cloistered life. Mystics such as Catherine of Siena (1347-1380), who transformedherself through flagellation into \"an anvil for the ofGod,\" Elspeth of Oye (from the Oetenbach cloister in Zu-rich), who allegedly spattered bystanders with blood fromthe fury of her self-torment, or Christina Ebner of the Engel-thal convent near Nuremberg were extolled in conventchronicles and contemporary hagiographies as charismatic penitents who attained holiness, ascetics who became \"earthly angels\" through their mortifying efforts to conformto Christ in suffering and love. 112Massively documented in a still-growing scholarly literature, that tradition requires noreview here. 113But it should be remarked that one of the two extant copies of the German translation of Catherine ofSiena's vitato feature illustrations was transcribed, and dated 1466, by a nun of the Katharinenkloster, Elisabeth Warr \u20acus- sin. 114Communal rites of penance, including ritual flagella- tion, likewise sustained these histories and brought theminto a living present. It is no coincidence that the perfor-mance of penitential discipline has been called\u2014with specialreference to the Dominicans\u2014\"perhaps the most importantceremony conducted in the chapter house.\" 115 To the extent that the Basilikabilder offered its beholders a vehicle for sequential meditation on the Passion, the series conjures it as a virtual participation in Rome's Good Friday liturgy. And because participation in the liturgies of HolyWeek condensed much of the spiritual fervor pilgrims toRome were invited to feel, it stands to reason that the 27Attributed to Hans Holbein the Elder, Epitaph for the Vetter Sisters, 1499, oil on pine panel, 70 \u00be\u00a3107 in. (179.7 \u00a3271.8 cm). Bayerische Staats- gem \u20acaldesammlungen, Staatsgalerie Augsburg, 4669 (artwork in the public domain; photo- graph by BPK, Berlin / ELDER' S SANTA CROCE IN GERUSALEMME 309pictures could indeed, in the right ritual setting, function as surrogate stations on an inner pilgrimage. This, or someother closely related, ritual imperative clearly guided theirarrangement within the chapter room and may have been the determining factor. 116If we follow the apex imagery around the room, we have: Gethsemane by Burgkmair (San Pietro ), Christ' s Arrest by Master L.F. (San Lorenzo and San Sebastiano), theFlagellation by Burgkmair (San Giovanni ), the Crowning with Thorns and Mocking of Christ by Holbein (San Paolo ), the Crucixion by Burgkmair (Santa Croce), and the Coronation of the Virgin by Holbein (Santa Maria Maggiore ). Correspond- ences between these Passion scenes and particular Roman churches, however, remain loose\u2014just as they do in an inter- esting trio of devotional panels (ca. 1470-80) by the so-calledMaster of the Riedener Altar, today preserved in Munich.Figure 28 reproduces the third panel in the sequence, whichwas originally painted for display in the Franciscan priory inKaufbeuren (founded 1315), possibly as part of a Stations ofthe Cross installation (Kreuzweg ). 117Shown schematically, the full cycle, encompassing all three panels, presents the follow- ing pairings from left to right: Upper scene Passion scene Christ Taking Leave of His Mother Arrest and Beating of Christ San Giovanni Laterano Christ before PilateSan Pietro Flagellation San Paolo Crowning with Thorns Santa Croce Carrying of the Cross San Lorenzo Christ Awaiting Crucixion Santa Maria Maggiore Deposition? San Sebastiano Entombment Anna Selbdritt Resurrection Inasmuch as the Augsburg cycle facilitates contemplative absorption in their individual schemes, Burgkmair's Santa Croce is perhaps the one panel most consistently dedicated to the symbolic and ritual nexus connecting Passion, pilgrim- age, and martyrdom. S. Croce was, after all, Rome's Passionrelic headquarters since its consecration in 325, built on thesite of the Sessorian Palace, where Empress Helena allegedlydeposited her collection of holy antiquities. Later known asthe Roman Calvary, in part because its floor was packed withHoly Earth brought from Jerusalem, S. Croce was also thepope's sanctuary for Good Friday masses, home to the famed mosaic icon of the imago pietatis and numerous Passion relics. 118Given these associations, it is conceivable that the Augsburg cycle performed double duty for recluses or visitors seeking simulated passages and spectacular indulgences: inaddition to the Roman basilican itinerary, the panels mighthave facilitated surrogate Jerusalem pilgrimages as well. 119 Conjectures such as this aside, what do the demonstrable connections with Passion pilgrimage and devotion tell us about the situated intention behind Burgkmair's ugly soldier in Augsburg? Informing the motif, I submit, is a theologicaland homiletic theme that had far-reaching resonances innorthern Passion piety\u2014a theme that effectively bridgedthe elite mysticism practiced by the nuns and the practicalpenitentialism at the heart of lay devotion before the Refor-mation. I refer to the notion scholars sometimes call the per-petual Passion: the characteristically late medieval idea that, with every sin committed inside the community of believers, with every new transgression, Christ is not only denied andbetrayed but tortured and crucied anew. Because sin per-sists in human affairs, the reasoning goes, the work ofredemption, the God-man's rescue of humanity from theclutches of death and the Devil\u2014thus, his suffering\u2014remains ongoing. Among its emblematic images are the liv-ing Man of Sorrows, shown actively bleeding and suffering in a perpetual present between Crucixion and Resurrection, and the so-called Sunday Christ (Feiertagschristus ), depicting Christ afflicted by the tools and implements of those who sinby working on Sundays. 120On the ancient Cross of Golgotha, Christ atoned for the offenses of humanity, suffering in everypart of his body, but in the present the sins of everyday lifeand the workaday world rack his body just as mercilessly. Inhis sermon cycle on the themes of Brant's cathedral preacher Johann Geiler von Kay-sersberg (1445-1510) argued the point, castigating those\"fool-blasphemers\" who pierced and sliced up Christ's bodyevery time they swore oaths on its members.

Images of Christ's ongoing suffering have their origins in the Passion liturgy and the high medieval theology of inter-cession, in particular, the idea of a tribunal misericordiae before the Heavenly Throne, where Christ and the Virginoffer a confluence of perfect sacricial substances\u2014blood onthe one side, milk on the other\u2014as proof of martyrologicalmerit in overcoming sin, a scene rst visualized in earlymanuscripts of the typological-devotional treatise Speculum humanae salvationis (composed about 1310 in Dominican circles). 122Whether it was due to the broad dissemination of theSpeculum itself in manuscript, block book, and numerous incunable editions, or to the castigations of preachers likeGeiler, the perpetual Passion's currency was widespread inGerman piety, elite and vernacular, and in Christianhumanism in Burgkmair's time: Albrecht D \u20acurer and the Viennese abbot Benedict Chelidonius (ca. 1460-1521), for example, drew strongly on the idea in their collabora- tions on the large and small woodcut Passion foliosbetween 1508 and 1511. 123 A dubious orthodoxy shadows the idea of the perpetual Passion.124Nevertheless, its implications are profound, and they reveal how incisively the notion could serve intra-Chris- tianpolemics and pastoral care. For what the perpetual Pas- sion demands is that the penitent sinner glimpse the violence of his own guilt every time he contemplates the Pas- sion, every time he remembers Golgotha, every time he wit-nesses Christ's enemies in their spiritual and physicalugliness, their and bestial predations, theirhideous barks, curses, and blasphemies. Within this psycho-logical dynamic where the Other reflects the Self, the com-pass of responsibility for the crisis of suffering widens;suddenly, it would seem, Christianity's doctrine of transhis- torical Jewish bloodguilt (culpa Iudaeorum ) has been sup- planted by the universality of sin within the Church' s community of believers. A fteenth-century hymn expressed the horizontalization of guilt this way: \"It is ourgreat sin and grievous misdeeds that nailed Jesus the true Son of God tothe Cross. For this reason we must not revile you, Poor Judah,and the host of Jews. The guilt is indeed ours.\" 125Nobody, in short, is innocent of Christ's blood. The usual mechanisms of guilt displacement and projective inversion break down, and each person is called to recognize that the historicalenemy is, and has always been, the \"Judaizing\" impulseswithin. Something like this double displacement of guilt\u2014the pious beholder's projection of guilt turned back Burgkmair's specular Jew look of horried recog-nition etched on that face. For the Dominican nuns of the Katharinenkloster, the gravest threat to their distinctive form of discipleship, thereal \"Judaizing\" menace haunting their spiritual vocation,was none other than their own bodies\u2014at least according tothe guidance they received from their advisers. In a poemknown as the Allegory of the Spiritual Scourge , from a manu- script in Nuremberg, a gure of the flagellum whose iron-studded tips stand for Love of God, Brotherly Love, Humility,Patience, Obedience, Generosity, Moderation, and Chastityis accompanied by these verses: O inhabitant of the cloister, take note / How you leadyour life / You have fled from the world and the devil /So that you could come into the cloister / But you still have your greatest enemy by you. / That, say I to you, is your own body. / You should strike it with this scourge /So that it does not overcome the soul. / You may wellmake it suffer, / But you should not, however, kill itcompletely. 126 Gratitude for God's loving mercy, dramatized to the emo- tional breaking point by the spectacle of Christ's tormentson Golgotha, which the practices of meditative pilgrimageenabled the nun to witness with her own spiritual vision, had to be coupled with a vigilant awareness of her own responsi- bility for that suffering, a horried comprehension of the car-nal self, and, thus, a painful, ongoing confrontation with theenemy within. The Look of Recognition Motifs of recognition function in narrative with a doubleaspect that distinguishes them from simple devices of plot:they serve both to represent the passage from ignorance (or self-deception) to knowledge (or self-knowledge) intratextu-ally, and to effect it extratextually\u2014or, in the present case, extrapictorially. Yet it is the nature of that passage to be slow and often painful: as experience, it is strewn with pitfalls and provisions; as aspiration, it is haunted by failure. Howeverwell-informed readers and beholders outside the narrativemay be of the story's outcomes, however sure of its necessity,the most important disclosures of truth\u2014those that demanda radical \"negation of one's past self\"\u2014produce a temporalgap, a period following the dawn, in which experience muststruggle to come to terms with knowledge. In religious narra- tive, recognition motifs therefore carry something of an almost sacramental value: more than tokens of the individu-al's inner transformation, they become agents of it. I havepresented here diverse material and carried out an extendedreading across three domains of analysis\u2014semiotic, icono-graphic, contextual\u2014of an embedded meta-image that,despite its marginality in the situation provided for it, provesuniquely adept at posing the challenge of recognition. Put in different terms, I have been concerned with the motif's effect or work (Wirkung ), seen as an integral expression of those demands a given work (Werk ) imposes on its beholders. 127It performs this work negatively by locating a single, exemplarybreakdown of recognition at the crossroads of human historyitself\u2014the Crucixion, when all eyes were xed on the para-doxical identity of the dead man said by some to be the Sonof God. And it performs this work reflexively, by conflating the drama of the Self's blindness to its own, true nature with that paradigmatic failure of christological recognition. Thiswas a failure the painter, like generations of Christian theolo-gians, polemicists, and moralists before him, saw S SANTA CROCE IN GERUSALEMME 311and carried forward into the new era sub gratia, not only by the reprobate Jews but also by the \"Judaizing\" impulses of Christian believers. Hans Burgkmair thematized this double failure in the Cru- cixion painted for the Katharinenkloster's chapter room.In the process of reinterpreting a catoptric motif he hadlearned from Augsburg painters of the preceding genera- tion, he struck on something of the dialectical entanglement of salvic recognition and the self-recognition of the sinneras an abject being tyrannized by carnality and cursed bydeath. Intuitively, it seems, he sensed that the Good Cen-turion's confession\u2014which splices two otherwise contradic-tory testimonies, \"Jesus was the Son of God\" and \"Jesus isdead\" into a double helix of salvic recognition\u2014nds itsstructural double in the Christian subject's self-recognition. The code embedded in that confession of identity we mightrecover from the important credal formulation of 1 Corinthi-ans 15:22, \"And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shallbe made alive,\" and render its twofold testimony this way: \"Iam a sinner descended from Adam\" and \"I am rescued fromdeath by Christ's death.\" Gazing out from the depths of the Vienna double por- trait, dated two years before the painter's own death, theBurgkmair of 1529 is surely believable as the author of amorally astringent admonition to self-recognition and adevastating indictment of a corrupt world in which nobody sees himself. At the risk of overtaxing the Augsburg motif, I have proposed a personalized meaning for it as well, regard-ing it as emblematic of the artist's authorial self-recognition. Without doubt, the Burgkmair who eventually came to dom-inate the Basilikabilder project between 1501 and 1504\u2014in the end contributing three of the six panels, commandingprogressively higher fees with each new commission, andhaving his panels prominently placed in the cycle's clock- wise pairings\u2014was keenly on the lookout for ways to impress his patrons, one-up his rivals, and register his presence inthe project. This happens emphatically in his nal state-ment for the nuns, the Santa Croce panel, which he signed 29Ulrich Apt the Elder and Crucixion center \u00a320in. Bayerische Staatsgem \u20acaldesammlungen, Staatsgalerie in der Katharinenkirche, Augsburg, 5349-51 (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by BPK, Berlin / Art Resource, NY)312ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2014 VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 3and dated 1504 over the threshold gate. In the course of seeking the best pictorial solution for harmonizing the shiftsin gure scale across its component scenes, Burgkmairtook time to study Holbein's compositions for the flankinghalf lunettes of the San Paolo tympanum, eventually record- ing them in meticulous line sketches. 128This attentiveness to his rival's contributions to the project is signicant.As Katharina Krause has shown, in the opening two decades of the sixteenth century patrician taste and patronage in Augsburg crystallized around the great \"alternative\" ofHolbein versus Burgkmair. 129Thirteen years separated the two men, whose families had close ties stretching backthrough the fteenth century. From all indications theyounger Burgkmair challenged himself to claim the mantle\"Maler von Augsburg,\" courting the new taste for Italianateforms, Orientalizing splendor, crystalline realism, unex- pected narrative twists, and psychologically rich character portrayals. Among these portrayals is the foolish, quasibestial soldier entering stage left in the Santa Croce panel. No open-and-shut case for the \"Jewishness\" of that visage has been made here,nor, as I have argued, is one needed. That Burgkmair wasready to label as \"Jewish\" the whole range of exotic attributesand Orientalizing characteristics in his tormentor gures is more than suggested by the pseudo-Hebrew lettering he used on the soldier wearing a green tunic, shown wielding aniron-spiked flagellum and eyeing his victim with a maliciousglint in the Flagellation scene that crowns the San Giovanni panel ,an ensemble he designed for prominent placement over the door of St. Katherine's chapter room. But his pur-pose, here and elsewhere, was not anti-Jewish invective. Draw-ing on his own inventiveness, and his own, growing resources as a Christian-humanist ethnographer, 130the artist reached for an oddly humanizing portrayal of \"Jewish blindness\" and transformed it into an allegory of Christian consciencepoised for conversion yet stubbornly resistant to the newstory\u2014the new text and the new self\u2014disclosed on Golgotha.In the Katharinenkloster's telescoped Passion cycle, Christ isset upon by his enemies and abandoned by his followers: thethree-panel Gethsemane in the apex of Burgkmair's San Pietro (the opening Passion image in the chapter room's viewingsequence) is precisely about this breakdown of discipleshipand the imminence of betrayal. As Christ prays for God toremove the chalice of suffering, the apostles remain in tfulsleep around him, while in the background Judas leadsCaiaphas's police under a banner with the SPQR armorial: \"behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands ofsinners\" (Mark 14:41). Perhaps this is why the gure of the Jewish witness on Cal- vary, the one who nally opens his eyes to see spiritually andtruthfully\u2014something we encounter in Dieric Bouts's evoca-tiveRandgur in the Granada triptych's left panel, his head- piece adorned with ersatz Hebrew (Fig. 1)\u2014could beimbued with such poignancy. 131Perhaps this also is the rea- son why the \"look\" of recognition, to the extent we can iden-tify it, became such a highly valued attribute of patrician virtue, indeed, a commodied form of distinction, in com- mercial cities like Augsburg, where painters excelled in flat-tering the piety of their patrons. Across the rich panorama ofmodish costumes, gleaming armor, and bristling weaponrypainted for the Rehlingers by Ulrich Apt the Elder (1460-1532) and his workshop, we have a frieze of portrait headswith expressions ranging from sorrowful absorption to awe-struck wonder, from sober comprehension to electrifyingrecognition (Fig. 29). 132When it was installed (about 1517), the altarpiece, designed for the newly founded family chapelin the Dominican church of Mary Magdalene, took its placein a stream of high-prole patrician donations equipped with keenly observed portrait likenesses, a body of works that eventually included Leonhard Beck's Adoration of the Magi of around 1520, the epitaphs made for the Vetter, Walther, andSchwarz families in the Katharinenkloster (ca. 1499, 1502,and 1508 respectively), and the Basilikabild panels them- selves. Through the looking glass conjured by the painter'sskill, these pious Augsburgers invite us into an ennobling c-tion\u2014the ction that each and every one of their own recog- nitions of Christ as Savior, as the living God hanging dead on the Cross, stands as a fait accompli. By implication, they tellus that their self-recognition as sinners\u2014penitent, grateful,and worthy of the fruits of Christ's sacrice, as well as theprayers of the living\u2014is likewise exemplary, praiseworthy toall who witness their act of turning to God.

Felipe Pereda helpfully brought them to my attention. 15.In posing the problem in terms of a Christian narrative poetics operating through visual media, I differentiate my approach to conversion tropes from the discourse of Christian aesthetics and the strong commitment to medieval image theology it entails; the keenest articulation of the latteris David Nirenberg's important \"The Judaism of Christian Art,\" inJudaism and Christian Art: Aesthetic Anxieties from the Catacombs to Colonial- ism,ed. Herbert Kessler and Nirenberg (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011), 387-427. For points of convergence between these two approaches, especially where gurations of Judaism and \"Judaizing\" are seen to structure the response to images, see below.16.Culbertson, Poetics of Revelation , 1-2. 17.In what follows, I refer to this gure generically as the \"Good Centurion\" despite the crisscrossing traditions that, from about the twelfth century,would conflate the two soldiers whose actions John 19 describes sequen- tially in verses 34 (the spear thrust) and 35 (the confession); see, for example, Jacobus de Voragine, The Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine, trans. Granger Ryan and Helmut Ripperger (Salem, N.H.: Ayer, 1987), 181. John of Caulibus, by contrast, keeps the two gures separate: the anonymous centurion who confesses (meditation for Sext and None)and the spear-wielding Longinus (Vespers), in Meditations on the Life of Christ, trans. Francis X. Taney Sr., Anne Miller O.S.F., and C. Mary Stal- lings-Taney (Asheville, N.C.: Pegasus, 2000), 256, 258; so, too, does the typological program of the Biblia pauperum (late fteenth century).

Hale, Artists and Warfare in the Renaissance (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990), 229-33; and Nigel Morgen, 2, 507- Overwhelmingly, the northern European tradition of themultigured Calvary distinguishes the two gures, with \"Longinus\" typi- cally characterized as a bearded elder gesturing toward his blind eyes (cf. again the Legenda aurea ), positioned stage right under the Cross. This Longinus is indeed a gure of conversion, with his own paradig- matic narrative, but he is not, in my view, a gure of recognition, a diver- gence I will develop in a forthcoming study. 18.On \"delegate\" gures as \"models of the observer,\" see Preludes: Some Observations on Vision, Medita- tion, and the 'Fifth Space' Early Liter-ature,\" in Ut Pictura Meditatio: The Meditative Image in Northern Art, 1500- 21.Robert C.

A related failure is the apostolic miscomprehension of metaphor and allegory, as in Matthew's story ofJesus's warning to them concerning the \"leaven of the Pharisees andSadducees\" before their arrival at Caesarea Philippi (Matt. 16:5-12); dis- in Nirenberg, \"The Judaism of Christian 24.I take my notion of models and antimodels from Maria Corti, \"Models and Anti-Models in Medieval Culture,\" New Literary History 10, no. 2 (Winter 1979): 339-66. 25.Culbertson, Poetics of Revelation ,1 5 0 . 26.Mark 15 places passersby, \"chief priests,\" and the Good Centurion (39)near the expiring Jesus but does not describe any soldiers; Matthew 27refers to \"the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus\" (54); Luke 23 offers: \"Now the centurion, seeing what was done, glori- ed God, saying: Indeed this was a just man. And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight, and saw the things that were done, returned striking their breasts\" (47-48). John, who places thechief priests and gambling soldiers on Golgotha before Jesus's death (19:21-35), merely invokes a soldier who witnesses the lance thrust and then gives testimony (19:35), making no mention of others around him. 27.The many vexed efforts to establish the relation between dramatic and pictorial representations of the Passion will not be discussed here, northe vast literature sampled.

Among Christian writers it is found rst in Paul (Gal. 2:14), who uses it to denounce the imposition of Jew- ish ceremonial law on Gentiles (the context is the dispute with Peter). Adapting Paul's use of the Greek verb, the Latin \"judaizare\" came todenote any type of Christian scriptural exegesis that was overly literal or legalistic (that is, \"carnal\"), but gradually evolved into a kind of catchall term for any and all heretical tendencies that seemed to give priority tothe Hebrew Bible and rabbinic writings, interest in Jewish holidays or ceremonial customs, dissenting views on theological denitions (posi- tions resembling those held by Jews or ascribed to them), even usurious money lending. See R /C19obert D /C19an, \"'Judaizare'\u2014the Career of a Term,\" in Antitrinitarianism in the Second Half of the Sixteenth Century ,e d .R /C19obert of Christian Art,\" 395-96; and more recently, the comprehensive treatment by David Nirenberg, Anti-Juda- ism: The Western Tradition (New York: W.

A later exam- ple from Antwerp, more relevant to our theme, is the Ecce Homo by Quinten Massys (ca. 1515, Museo del Prado, Madrid), in which the pol-ished helmet of one tormentor on the proscenium near Christ stands in for the Eyckian convex mirror. especially Belting and Kruse, Erndung des Gem \u20acaldes, 74-79, in whose account the mirror expresses the very \"Bildprinzip des Gem \u20acaldes\" (pic- torial principle of painting) (78).
